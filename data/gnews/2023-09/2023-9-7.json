        "title": "Ethereum Node and Client: A Complete Guide - crypto.news",
        "content": "Ethereum nodes and clients play a pivotal role in the ongoing transformation of the crypto landscape. Ethereum, a cryptocurrency that has captured the attention of enthusiasts for months, is poised to surpass Bitcoin as the industry\u2019s leading digital currency. Vitalik Buterin, the visionary creator of Ethereum, and the dedicated team of developers have been diligently working on a series of upgrades leading up to the eagerly anticipated main merge.\n\nEthereum nodes and clients form the backbone of this groundbreaking network. They are responsible for validating transactions, executing smart contracts, and ensuring the overall security and decentralization of the Ethereum ecosystem. In this article, we will delve deeper into the world of Ethereum nodes and clients, exploring their significance, functionality, and integral role in shaping the future of blockchain technology.\n\nThe Origin Story of Ethereum\n\nIn 2014, Vitalik Buterin published a white paper introducing Ethereum. The following year, 2015, saw the launch of the Ethereum platform by Buterin and Joe Lubin. Joe is also the founder of ConsenSys \u2013 a blockchain software company.\n\nEthereum has changed and improved a lot since it was first created, and all of these changes have led to one goal: making Ethereum the best crypto blockchain on the internet. Its operations are insanely good, and investors can trust that they are investing in a good project.\n\nIts ecosystem is made up of a variety of different specifications. Let\u2019s take a look at some of its finest features: Ethereum Nodes and Clients.\n\nThe Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nIn simple terms, Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts. Smart contracts are basically application code that is executed and verified by the network. Ethereum has become the go-to platform for DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFTs (non-fungible tokens).\n\nEthereum was created to be scalable, programmable, secure, and decentralized. It\u2019s the blockchain of choice for those who are creating technology on top of it. This blockchain is essential for these DeFi applications to develop and bring about a financial revolution.\n\nEthereum provides a highly flexible platform on which developers can create dApps using the native Solidity programming language and Ethereum Virtual Machine. The founders of Ethereum saw blockchain technology\u2019s potential for more than just creating a secure virtual payment method. Now, Ethereum is changing from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nWhat Is an Ethereum node?\n\nA node on the Ethereum network is any computer that runs the software required to interact with it. Nodes communicate with one another to validate transactions and store data about the blockchain\u2019s state.\n\nDepending on your needs, whether a dApp or a wallet, any client can run three types of nodes: full, light, and archive. Each node will uniquely evaluate data and provide various synchronization methods. This refers to how quickly your node can get new information so that you can use it.\n\nFull Nodes: Full nodes are jam-packed with data. They keep and distribute all of the blockchain data from the Ethereum network. A full node will also participate in block validation.\n\nA full node can interact directly with any smart contract on a public blockchain. In addition, nodes can also deploy new smart contracts onto the same type of blockchain. However, running a full node may be costly in terms of hardware and bandwidth. Obtaining all of the data can be very time-consuming.\n\nLight Nodes: Light nodes are similar to full nodes. However, they handle significantly less information. The light node keeps track of the header chain. This is the most basic information in a block, such as a timestamp and the previous block\u2019s hash.\n\nLight nodes are blockchain clients that only request data as needed. They can verify the validity of data, but they don\u2019t participate in block validation. Remote clients often use light nodes.\n\nArchive Nodes: A archive node is a node that keeps all of the data that a full node does and creates an archive of past blockchain states. Even after a client has finished synchronizing, archive nodes will store historical data.\n\nOn the other hand, full and light nodes will \u201cprune\u201d the historical blockchain data. This means they can rebuild it but do not retain this information. Archive nodes may not be of much use to the average user. However, they\u2019ve been instrumental in creating block explorers, wallet providers, and chain analytics applications.\n\nWhat Are Clients in Ethereum?\n\nIn computing, a \u201cclient\u201d is software downloaded to your computer that helps you interact with another type of software or service provided by a server. An Ethereum client is a program that enables Ethereum nodes to read blocks on the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. You\u2019ll need to download an Ethereum client software to run a node.\n\nWith Ethereum, many different clients can be created using various programming languages. However, they all follow the same protocol and rules. This allows them to interact with each other on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe most popular functions of Ethereum clients include transaction and mining interfaces, but their applications extend far beyond basic blockchain operations. The Ethereum Foundation maintains the following Ethereum clients:\n\n\u00b7 Geth (Go)\n\n\u00b7 OpenEthereum (Rust)\n\n\u00b7 Nethermind (C#, .NET)\n\n\u00b7 Besu (Java)\n\n\u00b7 Erigon (Go/Multi)\n\nIf the Ethereum Foundation doesn\u2019t support your go-to programming language, don\u2019t worry\u2013numerous third-party Ethereum clients can provide you with the language support you need. There are 3 types of Ethereum clients.\n\nFull Client: Full clients enable any node on the network to complete all tasks, such as mining, transactions, validating block headers, and running smart contracts.\n\nFull clients enable any node on the network to complete all tasks, such as mining, transactions, validating block headers, and running smart contracts. Light Client: Light clients are a subset of client functionality. Because they do not keep the entire Ethereum blockchain, light clients can offer quicker speeds and free up data storage space over full clients.\n\nLight clients are a subset of client functionality. Because they do not keep the entire Ethereum blockchain, light clients can offer quicker speeds and free up data storage space over full clients. Remote Client: A remote client is a third kind of client that resembles a light client. The primary distinction is that a remote client does not keep its copy of the blockchain and does not validate transactions or block headers.\n\nRather than running a full client, remote clients simply connect to the Ethereum blockchain network via a light or full client. These clients are most often used as wallets for sending and receiving transactions.\n\nThe Difference Between Ethereum Nodes and Clients?\n\nAlthough nodes and clients are often used interchangeably, they serve different purposes in accessing the Ethereum network. It may help to think of nodes and clients like a computer accessing the internet: the node would be an operating system, such as Windows or iOS, while the client is the physical computer.\n\nYou can tap into the node operating system using a client computer. From there, you gain access to the internet\u2013regardless of which type of computer or operating system you use.\n\nBottom Line\n\nNodes and clients are frequently equated, although they are not the same thing. The Clients and Nodes play vital roles in keeping the Ethereum blockchain functioning correctly. In short, an Ethereum node and client depend on each other to keep the Ethereum network functioning."

        "title": "Ethereum Whales Buy Up Over 200,000 ETH Within 24 Hours As Attractive Prices Prevail - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAs the bear market continues to tighten its grip, Ethereum has witnessed a decline in price mirroring the downward trajectory of Bitcoin.\n\nThis downturn has instilled apprehension among investors, resulting in a surge in selling activity surrounding this digital asset. Nonetheless, as retail takes fright, Ethereum whales are now taking advantage of the prevailing bearish sentiment, as they have commenced purchasing substantial quantities of ETH at current discounted prices.\n\nLate Tuesday, Ethereum whales made a substantial move by purchasing approximately 260,000 Ether (ETH) in just 24 hours. Ali Martinez, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, revealed this significant acquisition, amounting to nearly $425 million, on Twitter. The pundit shared a compelling chart from Santiment, showcasing the remarkable influx of capital into Ethereum despite prevailing market conditions.\n\nThis development unfolds against the backdrop of crypto prices remaining under pressure recently. Many have attributed Ether\u2019s weakness to dumping by big investors over the past four months, as well as prevailing regulatory challenges facing the crypto industry, particularly in the U.S.\n\nRecently, Brian Quinlivan, Santiment\u2019s marketing director, noted that large Ethereum (ETH) holders had exhibited bearish behaviour since around April, contrasting with their bullish stance observed in late 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere has been about a 4-month long dump in supply from addresses holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH. They really were accumulating significantly at the end of last year, but profit taking from these key tiers happened hard and quickly right as the price was hitting around a 1-year high of approximately $2,120.\u201d Quinlivan wrote.\n\nJust yesterday, Santiment highlighted two whales who sent 300,000 Ether to Coinbase, raising fears of an imminent dump among traders.\n\nOn the other hand, an analyst known by the pseudonym \u201cgreatest trader\u201d from Cryptoquant linked Ether\u2019s continued weakness to future traders who have been actively selling.\n\nIn a post earlier this week, the analyst noted Ethereum\u2019s ongoing bearish trend, illustrated by a declining 30-day moving average of the taker buy-sell ratio, signals dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders. In reading this metric, values above one signify bullish sentiment, while values below one indicate bearish sentiment.\n\nThe pundit shared a chart which depicts the continuous decline in the taker buy-sell ratio over the past few months, consistently remaining below the pivotal one mark and reaching a yearly low.\n\n\u201cThis consistent behavior underscores the dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders participating in Ethereum\u2019s market.\u201d He wrote.\n\nThe analyst noted that for Ethereum\u2019s price to embark on a new bullish trajectory, it would require a shift in behaviour among futures traders, characterized by a more aggressive buying stance, as indicated by a metric rising above the critical one threshold.\n\nEther was trading at $1,636 at press time, barely up a percentage point over the past 24 hours."

Discover SCENE\n\nEarn a free on-chain certificate touting your knowledge of Ethereum by taking Decrypt U's free course, Getting Started with Ethereum.\n\nAs of September 2023, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by total value, with a market capitalization of over $229 billion. Despite the fact that Ethereum\u2019s value is lower than that of rival Bitcoin, though, there is a good argument to be made that Ethereum is more important for the crypto and blockchain spaces overall than its larger competitor. Since its launch in 2015, the Ethereum network has been instrumental in powering the next generation of decentralized applications (dApps) and, more recently, the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) more broadly.\n\nThis is thanks to Ethereum\u2019s powerful smart contracts capabilities and versatility. As of March 2023, protocols built using the Ethereum network were responsible for about 90%, or $90 billion, of the total value locked in DeFi.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJust as Ethereum is a critical component of the crypto world and one that has shaped the development of the industry since its launch, the network\u2019s founder Vitalik Buterin is similarly influential. The Russian-Canadian programmer and writer\u2014who is not yet 30 years old as of this writing\u2014is arguably the single most famous individual in the world of cryptocurrency today (another prime candidate for this title, Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, is a pseudonymous name potentially representing more than one real person). Who is Vitalik Buterin, and how did he come to create Ethereum?\n\nEarly Interests Led to Crypto\n\nButerin was born in Russia but moved to Canada at a young age, where he was quickly recognized for his strong abilities in math. His earliest experiences with programming and crypto came at home, as his father was a computer scientist. Notably, Buterin\u2019s early experience with the massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft may have contributed to his desire to work outside of the traditional, centralized economics space: although a devoted player, he quit the game when developers made a change to the rules that he disagreed with.\n\nThrough high school and into college, Buterin honed his programming abilities and connected with influential mentors like the cryptographer Ian Goldberg, known for his involvement with the Tor Project among other things. It was during this time that he also first learned of Bitcoin, in 2011. Buterin wrote blog articles on cryptocurrency to earn his first BTC, eventually co-founding and contributing to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nCollege Years and Ethereum Origins\n\nAs a student at the University of Waterloo, Buterin assisted Goldberg until his work in cryptocurrency began to take up a substantial portion of his time. At this stage, he left university to travel the world for several months to connect with Bitcoin developers. This experience was crucial to Buterin\u2019s development of the Ethereum model, as he felt that the developers he met were all too concerned with specific uses for cryptocurrency. Buterin came to believe that the next generation of blockchain systems should be more versatile and broader.\n\nButerin\u2019s interest in broadening Bitcoin\u2019s scope led him to pursue a Turing-complete programming language to realize his vision. The young programmer created an initial white paper for this concept, which he called Ethereum, in 2013. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel\u2019s eponymous Fellowship awarded Buterin a grant of $100,000 in 2014, allowing him to fully focus his efforts on developing the new ecosystem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBetween Buterin\u2019s initial white paper in 2013 and Ethereum\u2019s eventual launch many months later, the vision developed to encompass much more than just a digital currency, adding ideas about smart contracts, decentralized applications, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) as well. By early 2014, Buterin was ready to share this wider concept with the crypto community, and he formally announced the project in January. An initial coin offering followed, raising about $18 million worth of BTC and allowing Buterin and his development team to launch the Ethereum Foundation to oversee Ethereum\u2019s continued growth. In July 2015, Ethereum officially launched.\n\nActivity Since Ethereum\u2019s Launch\n\nThe story of Ethereum is one of prolonged success (although not entirely free of setbacks as well), as the platform is now responsible for settling trillions of dollars worth of transactions each year. Indeed, the number of Ethereum transactions eclipsed the number of Bitcoin transactions in 2021. It has also been instrumental as the foundational network supporting movements like non-fungible tokens, a host of altcoins, and much more.\n\nButerin has continued to play a highly active role in Ethereum\u2019s success since launch. He has also been outspoken about what he sees as the ongoing dangers of centralized banking and currency control, making him a potent advocate for the crypto world even beyond his own network and token.\n\nButerin has also spoken out against what he sees as a potential \u201cdystopian\u201d future for the cryptocurrency industry in which ultra-wealthy whales fail to capitalize on the power of crypto to fight against authoritarian governments. He has pushed for Ethereum to play a role in making voting systems more fair, in helping to provide universal basic income, in supporting urban planning initiatives and public-works projects, and more. This may be one reason why Buterin was a particularly vocal supporter of The Merge, the late-2022 seismic shift in which Ethereum moved from a proof-of-work model to a proof-of-stake one. The Merge is expected to dramatically reduce the Ethereum network\u2019s energy consumption and to lower costs. Additionally, Buterin is known for his philanthropy, as he donated $1.2 billion to India\u2019s Covid relief fund in 2021, to several projects supporting Ukraine following Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022, and additional funds to a variety of research foundations."

        "content": "A new research paper co-authored by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin delves into the ways in which blockchains can remain both private and compliant with government regulations.\n\nThe paper comes during a notable period of friction between the use of permissionless networks and government agencies wishing to expand their oversight of such activities. Last month, two co-founders of the EVM-compatible transaction mixing service Tornado Cash were charged by the US government.\n\nThe paper\u2019s authors \u2014 Buterin, as well as Chainalysis chief scientist Jacob Illum, University of Basel professor Fabian Sch\u00e4r, doctoral candidate Matthias Nadler of the University of Basel, and Spankchain co-founder Ameen Soleimani \u2014 contend that good and bad actors could be distinguished through the use of a \u201csmart contract-based privacy enhancing protocol\u201d dubbed Privacy Pools.\n\nPrivacy Pools uses zero-knowledge (ZK) technology and enables users to generate a new withdrawal address that can\u2019t be linked to previous transactions.\n\nIt also lets users choose their own privacy settings \u2014 meaning they can exclude any suspicious users from their transactions. This can be achieved through Merkle roots.\n\nThe authors note that their intention is to find cooperative solutions between lawmakers, regulators and practitioners across various fields to ensure that privacy-enhanced infrastructure can thrive in an otherwise regulated environment.\n\n\u201cWe argue that the proposal is quite flexible and can be adapted to potentially satisfy a\n\nlarge variety of regulatory requirements,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThe paper should be seen as a humble contribution towards a potential future in which financial privacy and regulation can co-exist.\u201d\n\nInside Privacy Pools\n\nAny crypto asset created and spent on a blockchain possesses a coin ID (or hash) associated with it. This information is stored using a Merkle tree, a data structure through which each hash is linked to another hash in a tree-like structure.\n\nNumerous transaction hashes are stored in a block, and each block is also hashed, creating a Merkle root.\n\nIn tandem with zero-knowledge tech \u2014 which enable blockchains to prove that data is accurate without revealing the information itself \u2014 users can prove that their withdrawals are made through a previous deposit. At the same time, they\u2019d only reveal information from a limited data set of their choosing.\n\nThis means that honest users can prove that the origins of their funds are not directly tied to criminal activity.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Zero-knowledge (ZK) proof solutions have proved critical in helping scale the Ethereum ecosystem, but proto-danksharding is expected to drastically reduce the cost of rollups, according to Consensys\u2019 zkEVM Linea head Nicolas Liochon.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Cointelegraph Magazine editor Andrew Fenton during Korea Blockchain Week, Liochon estimated that proto-danksharding could further reduce rollup costs by 10 times.\n\nProto-danksharding, also known by its Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) identifier EIP-4844, is aimed at reducing the cost of rollups, which typically batch transactions and data off-chain and submit computational proof to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has yet to nail down an expected launch date for proto-danksharding, but development and testing are still ongoing.\n\nAs Liochon explained, Linea delivers 15 times cheaper transactions compared to those made on Ethereum\u2019s layer 1, but rollups are still limited by the fact that transactions are posted in call data in Ethereum blocks.\n\nAccording to Ethereum\u2019s documentation, rollups are still expensive in terms of their potential because call data is processed by all Ethereum nodes and the data is stored on-chain indefinitely despite the fact that the data only needs to be available for a short period of time.\n\nEIP-4844 will introduce data blocks that can be sent and attached to blocks. The data stored in blocks is not accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and will be deleted after a certain time period, which is touted to drastically reduce transaction costs.\n\n\u201cIn reality, the cost of rollups is down to data availability. We are writing all the data to layer 1, which is why we have exactly the same security. But it\u2019s expensive; it represents 95% of the cost.\u201d\n\nLiochon said that Linea\u2019s prover, which essentially handles the off-chain computation that verifies, bundles, and then creates a cryptographic proof of the combined transactions, only represents a fifth of the cost.\n\nThis highlights the major hurdle in making ZK-rollups the go-to scaling solution for the Ethereum ecosystem as opposed to other solutions like Optimistic Rollups.\n\nLiochon also said that Linea aims to be a general-purpose ZK-rollup that will be used for a variety of decentralized applications and solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe are a generic rollup. We don\u2019t want to have a specific use case or specific domain. It\u2019s quite important to support all types of applications, including DeFi, gaming and social.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, Consensys completed the launch of Linea in August 2023, having onboarding over 150 partners and bridging more than $26 million in Ether (ETH).\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

These issues, he emphasized, have remained constant over the past six years.\n\nBack in 2017, Ethereum took a significant step toward enhancing privacy by introducing zero-knowledge proofs like zk-SNARKs. Fast forward to 2023, and Ethereum has made substantial progress in this domain. Advanced technologies like STARK, Zero-Knowledge rollups and Cairo are now part of the Ethereum landscape. Nevertheless, privacy remains a concern, mainly due to legal and acceptance issues surrounding tokens generated by privacy systems, as exemplified by the Tornado Cash case, concluded the developer.\n\nButerin introduced the concept of proof-of-innocence, a means to validate tokens within privacy systems without revealing transaction origins. This concept underscores the importance of privacy and ongoing efforts to optimize zk-SNARKs for seamless integration into mainstream finance.\n\nCentralization and hacks\n\nShifting to consensus security, Ethereum has fully embraced a consensus mechanism, but challenges endure. These include simplifying the protocol, addressing centralization concerns and streamlining participation, notably through proof of stake.\n\nIn the realm of smart contract security, notable efforts have been made since 2017. Fast forward to 2023, and Ethereum has made significant progress in this arena. Buterin noted that the frequency of hacking incidents has dramatically decreased since the notorious DAO hack. Improved security measures and heightened awareness within the Ethereum community have played a pivotal role in mitigating risk.\n\nIn summary, Vitalik Buterin's keynote address shed valuable light on Ethereum's journey over the years. While recognizing ongoing challenges, his speech was aimed at demonstrating Ethereum's focus on practical solutions, mainstream adoption and enhancing user benefits."

Notable recipients include ZeroDev Kernel, Skandha Bundler, and MynaWallet, which integrates with the Japanese Government-Issued ID Card. These grants promote modularization, diverse blockchain applications, and enhance the Ethereum network's capabilities.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has officially unveiled the 18 recipients of the ERC-4337 Account Abstraction grant round. This milestone event marks a significant stride towards enhancing the capabilities of the Ethereum network and underscores the Foundation's dedication to supporting projects that are set to redefine the blockchain landscape.\n\nThe ERC-4337, known as Account Abstraction, introduces a groundbreaking concept that has the potential to revolutionize smart contract accounts. It enables these accounts to become more versatile, efficient, and customizable, thus opening the door to a myriad of possibilities for developers and users alike.\n\nAmong the standout recipients of the ERC-4337 Account Abstraction grants is ZeroDev Kernel. Spearheaded by Derek Chiang and Taek Lee, ZeroDev Kernel has developed a smart contract account named Kernel, which is purpose-built for use in Account Abstraction wallets. What sets Kernel apart is its compatibility with ERC-4337, efficiency optimizations, and modularity. It's currently the most widely adopted AA account across major Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base.\n\nEtherspot's Skandha Bundler has also been recognized for its groundbreaking contributions. This project introduces a unique mempool designated for activities performed by Account Abstraction wallets, along with an innovative concept called a \"bundler\" that streamlines user operations. Etherspot's bundler, Skandha, has already made its mark on six testnets and eleven mainnets, demonstrating the broad reach of Account Abstraction's potential impact.\n\nMynaWallet is another remarkable grant recipient, working on a Contract Account that integrates with the Japanese Government-Issued ID Card (Myna Card). This integration allows users to seamlessly make token payments, transfer NFTs, and execute various transactions without needing to have an in-depth understanding of cryptocurrencies.

        "content": "On-chain data shows a crypto whale \u201c0x13e382\u201d lost $24.23 million worth of liquid staked Ethereum, including 4,851 rETH (worth $8.58 million) and 9,579 stETH ($15.63 million), to phishing scammers on Sept. 6.\n\nWeb3 security firm Scam Sniffer revealed that the whale had unwittingly given token approval to the scammers by signing \u201cincreaseAllowance\u201d transactions. The firm described the theft as probably \u201cthe largest amount ever stolen from a single victim.\u201d\n\nThe stolen funds initially landed in two addresses, namely 0x693b72 and 0x4c10a4. However, the scammers have relocated some of these assets to Fixed Float exchange, while the remainder resides in three other distinct addresses.\n\nNotably, Scam Sniffer observed that one of the addresses connected to this fraudulent activity, specifically 0x4c10a4, is associated with numerous cryptocurrency phishing websites and has maintained activity since May 21.\n\nAlthough the victim\u2019s identity remains undisclosed, their transaction history indicates a seasoned liquidity provider with substantial on-chain experience. This wallet has operated since 2017 and currently facilitates over $1.6 million in WBTC/USDT liquidity on the Uniswap V3 platform.\n\nPhishing scams rampant on X\n\nThe rise of phishing scams on X, formerly Twitter, has become a growing concern for the crypto community, which has been inundated with several verified paid bots using the social media platform to perpetrate their activities.\n\nOn-chain investigator ZachXBT specifically expressed concerns about this issue, drawing the crypto community\u2019s attention to the proliferation of fake verified organizations on the platform.\n\n\u201cVerified orgs were intended to make it harder for scammers, but it has just created a new black market for accounts with no way for us to report and take down these accounts easily,\u201d he said.\n\nThis underscores the persistent threat of phishing scams in cryptocurrency, even amid a bear market. According to cybersecurity experts at Kaspersky, crypto-related phishing scams have increased by 40% year-on-year."

However, despite its pioneering status and trailblazing aspirations, a myriad of persistent issues still affect the network today.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s status and significance in the industry have led many Web3 projects to build upon its legacy and attempt to address its inherent problems, co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes the network\u2019s issues are far from \u2018fixed,\u2019 despite the tremendous progress.\n\nButerin: Much of Etheruem\u2019s Challenges Remain the Same\n\nIn a recent talk at Nanyang Technology University, Vitalik Buterin delved deep into some of Ethereum\u2019s biggest challenges: privacy, consensus, smart contract security, and scalability, which, according to the founder, remain key hurdles impeding the network\u2019s growth.\n\nButerin pointed out that much of Ethereum\u2019s technical challenges persist today, echoing concerns from six years ago.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, one of the things about the progress of Ethereum technology is that we are talking about things today that are very similar to things we were talking about six years ago\u2026 If you ask me or anyone else what the biggest problems facing Ethereum are, you\u2019ll get basically the same answers,\u201d said Buterin.\n\nDespite the network\u2019s shift towards a more eco-friendly and privacy-focused approach, with the introduction of zero-knowledge cryptography-based solutions and the adoption of the Proof-of-Stake consensus model, Ethereum grapples with a range of challenges, including protocol complexity, network congestion, high gas fees, and more.\n\nAdding to the long list of issues, Vitalik acknowledged that smart contract security remains a major concern and has made slower progress than other inherent issues despite receiving a major overhaul to its programming language.\n\nHowever, in the face of these challenges, Buterin offered some reprieve by ensuring that its developer community is actively working to innovate and deliver new solutions. The founder noted that \u2018tremendous progress has been made,\u2019 with many ongoing projects in the pipeline, including improvements to the EVM, State Trees, and account abstraction.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nEthereum co-founder Buterin expressed that he stakes only a small portion of his ETH holdings due to security concerns.\n\nA high-profile Ethereum developer compared Etheruem\u2019s staking to sausage manufacturing, implying that a deeper understanding could reveal less appealing aspects of the network\u2019s staking mechanism.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nEthereum is the second-largest blockchain project in the industry. Its inability to solve persistent issues dating back six years isn\u2019t a good look for the network and its community of developers.\n\nRead how one transaction request turned into a $24M nightmare:\n\nCrypto Whale Nightmare: $24M Lost in Massive Phishing Scam\n\n\n\nRead why Cardax closed down:\n\nCardano DEX Cardax Shuts Down, Cites Regulatory Turbulence"

        "content": "S-1 and 19b-4 filings have been made for the spot Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nETH saw a mild reaction to the news of the filings.\n\nThe race to launch an Ethereum [ETH] ETF began on 6 September, with Ark Investment and 21 Shares filing applications. How does this type of ETF differ from futures-based ETH ETFs, and what potential impact could it have on the price and adoption of Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nCountdown begins for Ethereum spot ETF decision\n\nIn a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 6 September, asset management firms ARK Invest and 21Shares have submitted requests for regulatory approval to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF), specifically designed to hold ETH.\n\nThis ETF marks the initial effort to introduce such a fund in the United States.\n\nAlso, as explained by James Seyffart on X (formerly Twitter), the initial filing made by Ark 21Shares was classified as an S-1 filing. This type of filing doesn\u2019t trigger an immediate countdown for SEC approval.\n\nTold you guys to expect some 19b-4's!! haha. Look for even more tomorrow and Friday. https://t.co/zlxzjzP7yP \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 6, 2023\n\nHowever, a subsequent document, categorized as a 19b-4 filing, was submitted by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) on 6 September. In this 19b-4 filing, the CBOE formally requested that the ARK 21Shares and the VanEck Ethereum ETF investment products be listed on CBOE\u2019s BZX Exchange.\n\nJames Seyffart pointed out that the 19b-4 filings, in contrast to the earlier S-1 filings, signified that the SEC\u2019s decision-making process is now in motion. Also, it started the countdown for a final decision.\n\nHow does this differ from a futures Ethereum ETF?\n\nFutures-based Ethereum ETFs differ significantly from spot Ethereum ETFs. In futures-based ETFs, ETH itself is not held as an asset. Instead, these ETFs utilize derivative contracts, particularly futures contracts, as their underlying assets. As a result, the value of these ETFs is directly tied to the performance of ETH futures contracts and may not necessarily track the real-time spot price of ETH.\n\nMoreover, the liquidity of futures ETFs is contingent upon the liquidity of the ETH futures contracts they are based on. If the futures contracts themselves lack liquidity, it can impact the liquidity and trading of the ETF.\n\nConversely, spot Ethereum ETFs hold actual ETH as their underlying asset. This means that they closely follow the spot price of ETH, which is the current market price of Ethereum. Also, the liquidity of spot Ethereum ETFs is determined by ETH\u2019s availability and trading volume.\n\nHow these filings could impact Ethereum\n\nIntroducing an Ethereum ETF would simplify gaining exposure to ETH for a wider spectrum of investors. This enhanced accessibility has the potential to stimulate greater demand for Ethereum.\n\nMoreover, ETFs are renowned for their high liquidity, and establishing an Ethereum ETF could enhance liquidity in the Ethereum market. This increased liquidity can draw in more traders and investors, potentially resulting in elevated trading volumes.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nHow ETH reacted to the ETF news\n\nThe 4-hour timeframe chart of Ethereum displayed a modest price uptick on 6 September. By the close of trading, ETH was trading at approximately $1,632, showing a slight price increase on a daily timeframe.\n\nHowever, as of this writing, it had retraced some of these gains and was trading at around $1,630. This suggested that the recent ETF-related news had a minimal impact on its ongoing price trend. However, this could change once news of ETF approval emerges."

High-value NFTs will win on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe proposal to migrate to Bitcoin was passed by 99% of OnChainMonkey tokenholders.

Holders will receive the corresponding Bitcoin Ordinal once they\u2019ve burned the Ethereum NFT.\n\nHowever, Yang says the migration shouldn\u2019t be too challenging compared to what Metagood has already accomplished in the Bitcoin Ordinals space:\n\n\u201cWe were the first to inscribe 10,000 images of a collection on Bitcoin. We were the first to launch a parent-child collection with OCM Dimensions 300.

This just removes the connection to Casa on-chain.\u201d\n\nThe service involves additional steps compared to the Casa Relay, and users are required to cover gas fees with their pay wallet, with the trade-off being added privacy for users looking to avoid on-chain ETH addresses being connected to Casa.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: NFT collapse and monster egos feature in new Murakami exhibition"

        "content": "Ark Invest and VanEck officially filed for spot Ethereum ETFs on Tuesday.\n\nVanEck made its intention known to apply for a spot Ethereum product in 2021, but now the application has officially started.\n\nThe SEC has 240 days to respond to the applications.\n\nHappy Thursday!\n\nArk Invest joined VanEck in the race for the first spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund on Wednesday. The fund managers\u2019 applications come weeks after a slew of Ethereum futures ETF applications were made \u2014 which are yet to be approved.\n\nLet\u2019s get into it!\n\nEthereum ETF race\n\nDespite approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs being far from a certainty, fund managers already jostle for a spot Ethereum product.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest filed an application for a spot Ethereum ETF on Wednesday alongside VanEck \u2014 who had originally filed an application in July 2021 but not its 19b\u20134, a form used by companies to inform the SEC of its plans to file for an ETF. Yesterday\u2019s filing officially starts the decision clock for the US Securities and Exchange Commission, giving them up to 240 days to respond.\n\nBoth plan to trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nArk Invest and 21Shares want to \u201cincrease access and exposure to crypto-backed assets, beyond Bitcoin,\u201d Cathie Wood and 21Shares CEO and co-founder Hany Rashwan said in a joint statement shared with DL News.\n\n\u201cAs the regulatory environment changes, we are committed to innovating, developing and launching products providing efficient and regulated ways to access Ethereum in the market,\u201d the pair concluded.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe news comes hot on the heels of several Ethereum futures ETF applications filed at the beginning of August. Futures ETFs track the value of Ethereum futures prices on the CME, as opposed to spot ETFs which track the underlying assets value in real-time.\n\nIn August it was reported that the SEC was poised to approve the sale of futures ETF for Ethereum. Some analysts expect this could ignite a brutal fee war between issuers jostling to attract investors.\n\nThe latest round of applications follow last week\u2019s courtroom win for Grayscale. The asset manager is fighting to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF and has faced numerous rejections from the SEC. Its courtroom win led many experts to say a spot Bitcoin ETF is a matter of when, not if.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin was flat over the past 24 hours, trading around $25,700. The leading asset by market capitalisation could face more downward price pressure as the US dollar strengthens. Typically Bitcoin and the US dollar have an inverse relationship, so the price of Bitcoin drops as the dollar appreciates. The dollar index is up 1.8% in the past week.\n\nEthereum slipped 0.2% in the past day, to trade at about $1,630.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading"

        "content": "Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Explores Privacy Protocol Amid Tornado Cash Concerns\n\nSource: ShutterStock\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has collaborated on a research paper that explores the development of a privacy protocol called Privacy Pools.\n\nThe paper aims to address concerns surrounding existing privacy platforms such as Tornado Cash while advocating for the coexistence of financial privacy and regulation, according to its abstract.\n\nAside from Buterin, a number of other crypto veterans also collaborated on the paper, including core developer Ameen Soleimani, Chainalysis researcher Jacob Illum, and academics Matthias Nadler and Fabian Schar.\n\nDescribed as a \u201csmart contract-based privacy-enhancing protocol,\u201d Privacy Pools utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to assess the legitimacy of user funds without revealing the complete transaction history.\n\nThe main objective is to establish a \u201cseparating equilibrium\u201d that filters out funds associated with criminal activities while striking a balance between privacy and regulatory requirements.\n\nPrivacy Pools to Increase Privacy While Filtering Out Unlawful Transactions\n\nThe proposed approach allows users to publish zero-knowledge proofs that demonstrate the origin of their funds without disclosing the entire transaction graph.\n\nThis offers a potential solution for verifying the legality of funds while preserving transactional privacy.\n\n\u201cThe core idea of the proposal is to allow users to publish a zero-knowledge proof, demonstrating that their funds (do not) originate from known (un-)lawful sources, without publicly revealing their entire transaction graph,\u201d the paper said.\n\nThe authors acknowledged the utility of platforms like Tornado Cash as privacy tools. However, they also highlighted the susceptibility of such platforms to misuse by illicit actors.\n\nTornado Cash faced legal challenges last year when it was accused of facilitating transactions for the North Korea-linked hacking group Lazarus.\n\nIn response, the US Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control blacklisted Tornado Cash in August 2022 due to its alleged involvement in illicit activities.\n\nBy exploring the development of Privacy Pools, Buterin and his collaborators aim to address the concerns raised by Tornado Cash\u2019s legal troubles while advocating for a privacy protocol that aligns with regulatory requirements.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, privacy and regulatory compliance are perceived as incompatible,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\n\u201cThis paper suggests that this does not necessarily have to be the case, if the privacy-enhancing protocol enables its users to prove certain properties regarding the origin of their funds.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Buterin has recently admitted that centralization of nodes is one of the Ethereum network\u2019s biggest challenges, given the fact that the majority of the 5,901 active Ethereum full nodes are run on centralized platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe Ethereum mastermind said that he hopes in the future fully verified Ethereum nodes can \u201cliterally\u201d run on a phone.\n\nHe claimed that solving the issue with centralization of full nodes is a \u201cbig piece of the puzzle\u201d to making Ethereum more decentralized."

        "title": "OnChainMonkey Embarks on a Bold Migration from Ethereum to Bitcoin, Citing Enhanced Security - NFT Culture",
        "content": "In an announcement that\u2019s shaking up the NFT space, OnChainMonkey NFT collection is making a daring transition. The collection is moving its comprehensive array of 10,000 NFTs from Ethereum to Bitcoin. As first reported by Cointelegraph, this massive transition is set to span several months and is a testament to the overwhelming trust the community has in Bitcoin\u2019s unparalleled security and decentralization mechanisms.\n\nDeciphering the Bold Move\n\nDanny Yang, CEO of Metagood, unveiled this impending transition on September 7th. He emphasized that their prime collection, OCM Genesis, will transition from Ethereum\u2019s realm to that of Bitcoin. Originally launched on Ethereum in September 2021, the OnChainMonkey collection is making this stride mainly because of the community\u2019s unanimous sentiment. They resoundingly believe in the security and decentralization features Bitcoin Ordinals offers over Ethereum.\n\nHighlighting this sentiment, Yang stated, \u201cThe Bitcoin Ordinal protocol distinctly outshines the Ethereum NFT protocol in areas of decentralization and security. This paves the way for high-caliber NFTs to truly shine on Bitcoin.\u201d A monumental 99% of OnChainMonkey tokenholders endorsed this shift, spotlighting their shared conviction in the benefits of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, transitioning isn\u2019t a cakewalk. Metagood anticipates a sizable expenditure, which might exceed $1 million, to ensure this migration is hiccup-free.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals is a big deal. I\u2019ve been building on Bitcoin for over ten years, and Ordinals is the most significant development in recent years. Don\u2019t get distracted by the monkey JPEGs talk, and do learn why the Ordinals Protocol is important. \ud83d\udc47\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 danny huuep (@huuep) June 20, 2023\n\nPreserving Legacy and Authenticity\n\nAmidst the intricacies of this process, every newly crafted OnChainMonkey on Bitcoin promises to have a clear lineage traced back to its Ethereum counterpart. To effectuate this, holders will be awarded the corresponding Bitcoin Ordinal once they\u2019ve decommissioned their Ethereum NFT.\n\nYang also revisited Metagood\u2019s prior ventures to showcase their proficiency in handling such tasks. He remarked, \u201cOur trailblazing endeavors include inscribing 10,000 images of a collection on Bitcoin, initiating a parent-child collection with OCM Dimensions 300, and pioneering recursive inscriptions on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nYet, Ethereum continues to reign supreme in the NFT marketplace. As per CryptoSlam\u2019s recent data, Ethereum is leagues ahead with a whopping $236.8 million in NFT deals over the past month. Bitcoin, while making commendable strides, is currently placed sixth with $11.1 million.\n\nYang, however, is buoyant about Bitcoin\u2019s prospects. He envisions a vibrant Bitcoin-centric NFT ecosystem and believes that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have the potential to co-exist and prosper.\n\nOrdinals is an elegant protocol, and like Bitcoin, is both simple and powerful.\n\nSnapshot of the Present Market\n\nPresently, OnChainMonkey NFTs are traded at an average baseline price of 1.10 Ether (ETH). They\u2019ve accumulated an impressive transaction volume exceeding 20,550 ETH since debuting on the illustrious NFT marketplace, OpenSea, in September 2021. Notably, a hefty 31% of the 2,900 OnChainMonkey NFT aficionados are unique, as stated by OpenSea.\n\nThe transition was further facilitated by the inception of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens at the beginning of this year, a development following the successful Taproot soft fork in November 2021.\n\nTL;DR: As first spotlighted by Cointelegraph, OnChainMonkey NFT collection is transitioning its entire assortment of 10,000 NFTs from Ethereum to Bitcoin. The community\u2019s faith in Bitcoin\u2019s security and decentralization features fuels this move."

        "content": "Ethereum, the second-most valued cryptocurrency in the world, is currently beginning to draw greater interest from investors.

Ethereum investors entered the market in December 2017, when the price of the cryptocurrency, along with most others, reached an all-time high. Today, we\u2019ll highlight the top seven.\n\nOne reason Ethereum has been a darling among investors is that it\u2019s truly so much more than just a cryptocurrency project. Given that its platform supports dApps, smart contracts, and new blockchain projects, one could claim that Ethereum is the most significant blockchain project in the world and actively helps the widespread use of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhen investing in Ethereum as a platform, numerous dangers are involved, as there are with all cryptocurrencies. This hasn\u2019t stopped a lot of individuals from doing it, though, including many famous people and notable figures in the cryptosphere.\n\nListed below are some well-known Ethereum investors:\n\nJonathan Lubin\n\nJoseph Lubin is one of the most well-known figures connected to the Ethereum investors and has extensive experience in software engineering, robotics, machine vision, and neural networks. One of the largest Ethereum investors may very well be the co-founder of Ethereum and the creator of ConsenSys, a Brooklyn-based software business specializing in creating decentralized applications (dApps) based on the Ethereum platform.\n\nAccording to numerous rumors, Joseph Lubin reportedly was one of the top purchasers during the Ethereum crowd sale event that took place a few years ago. According to numerous business sources, Joseph Lubin is one of the most significant Ethereum holders, with a market cap that might reach $10 billion.\n\nMr. Lubin founded the Swiss-based organization EthSuisse, which has simultaneously made significant investments in Ethereum. With ConsenSys and EthSuisse, they invest in solutions that will be able to provide users with greater services in addition to the network\u2019s future.\n\nAdditionally, Lubin has participated in numerous industry-spanning groups that have advanced solutions for problems with governance in the blockchain area. Thus, when you buy Ethereum, it doesn\u2019t necessarily imply cash directly to developers. Still, it may also be through establishing new services, gathering efforts to create new solutions, and increasing the overall ecosystem.\n\nRichard Sherman\n\nAnother well-known person who loves cryptocurrency and is a big Ethereum investor is cornerback Richard Sherman, the San Francisco 49ers of the NFL (National Football League). As soon as people began inquiring if they could buy goods and merchandise from his official website using different digital tokens, Sherman began investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nRichard revealed on many occasions that he has a few BTC, ETH, and LTC but is not interested in the diversity of other smaller coins. When Bitcoin was worth roughly $1,000, he bought some, and when the price soared to $19,000, he was able to sell it. In any case, he said he regretted not retaining the Bitcoins exactly as they were.\n\nRichard Sherman has been voted All-Pro four times as well as four times for the Pro Bowl. Between 2011 and 2017, he was a member of the Seattle Seahawks, and as of 2018, he is a member of the San Francisco 49ers. Mr. Sherman is a spokesperson for the trivia app FleetWit in addition to having an interest in cryptocurrency. He also has investments in other tech stocks, demonstrating that his portfolio is well-diversified.\n\nThe Winklevoss Brothers, in Ethereum investors, are Cameron and Tyler.\n\nBecause of their involvement in the cryptocurrency industry, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have frequently made headlines. Even though the Winklevoss brothers gained notoriety after suing Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg because he appropriated their idea for a social network, they are now recognized as some of the biggest Ethereum investors.\n\nThe brothers\u2019 settlement for an astounding $65 million in Facebook stock and cash was made possible by the lawsuit. They chose to invest in Bitcoin after recognizing the potential in blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. In the end, the brothers purchased 120,000 Bitcoins in 2012 at less than $10. They re-invested after achieving financial success and amassed almost $350 million from various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. The siblings are also well-known for founding the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, which is situated in New York.\n\nThe Winklevoss brothers held Ethereum in addition to their investments in Bitcoin (BTC), their primary focus. According to Tyler Winklevoss, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are tokens on top of tokens and do not adhere to securities regulations. Mr. Winkleovss stated that the Ethereum network and its tokens have more value in the network than in other digital tokens.\n\nWhether they have chosen to sell a portion of their stake or how much ETH they now retain is unclear at this time. Regardless of their virtual currency, they will play a significant part in the entire cryptocurrency market.\n\nVitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum\n\nFor those familiar with the cryptocurrency industry, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s name scarcely has to be introduced. Without Vitalik, the brains behind the entire Ethereum project and perhaps the most significant figure in the cryptocurrency world after Satoshi Nakamoto, our list wouldn\u2019t be complete.\n\nIt is commonly known that Vitalik Buterin has one of the highest net worths in the cryptocurrency industry. The creator has never revealed how much Ethereum he has; however, rumors are that he transferred 30,000 ETH to Bitstamp, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, in December 2017. Vitalik is portrayed as the owner of around 500,000 ETH in other forums and public posts.\n\nIn the end, only Vitalik Buterin himself can provide an answer to this query. What\u2019s more amazing is that most people don\u2019t picture Buterin as a wealthy individual; rather, they picture him as the creator of one of the best blockchain platforms, someone for whom money is not a priority, and someone who is constantly seeking solutions to real problems in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAs a participant in the cryptocurrency market, Mr. Buterin\u2019s investment in the Ethereum network goes beyond simple financial gain. As a developer and the manager of various teams devoting their time and resources to enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem, he is committed to Ethereum.\n\nTherefore, investing time and effort into the network is another approach. In addition, many businesses rely on his suggestions and counsel when deciding where to put their money to support Ethereum developers. More adoption indicates stronger Ethereum fundamentals, which eventually translates into a higher price for the digital asset known as ETH.\n\nJoseph Lubin and Buterin are both in similar circumstances. They co-founded Ethereum together and have been working to grow its projects and solutions ever since. Although they may not make significant investments in ETH, they have been attempting to increase ETH\u2019s value over time.\n\n#Ethereum CEO speaks openly about shorting ETH at the top without shame, dumping on his investors. Some people who lost money on it will keep defending ETH and other centralized Shitcoins. Only #Bitcoin is the real deal. pic.twitter.com/egXvgahaCj \u2014 Doctor Profit \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udded (@DrProfitCrypto) July 28, 2022\n\nAshton Kutcher\n\nAshton Kutcher, the Hollywood actor, is recognized as a big Ethereum investor. He has made an early investment in cryptocurrencies, technology, and applications like Uber and Airbnb. He was one of the first famous people to join the cryptocurrency mania, and in 2014, almost a year before Ethereum was officially released, he tweeted about it. Although an official figure has not yet been disclosed, Kutcher is reportedly among the biggest investors in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso, read \u2013 Ask Yourself These 5 Questions Before Making An Ethereum Investment\n\nJohn Hoskinson\n\nA further Ethereum co-founder is Charles Hoskinson. He is currently the principal developer of Ethereum Classic and Cardano (ADA) (ETC). He has been putting in the effort to provide Ethereum alternatives.\n\nDespite this, he was a pioneer in the use of digital money. He joined the area when the price of one bitcoin was $0.90. He decided to oversee other significant initiatives and begin moving forward with the expansion in the crypto field when the value of the digital currency reached $250.\n\nAs the network\u2019s co-founder, it is important to note that he was one of the first Ethereum investors. He omitted, however, to say if he eventually sold all of his coins or what percentage he had invested in the cryptocurrency initiative.\n\nHe has worked on numerous cryptocurrency projects, but he is currently concentrating on Cardano, one of the most popular ones on the market. His efforts have had a significant positive impact on the cryptocurrency sector and have raised the bar for technical advancements within the industry. To compete with other networks like Cardano, including Ethereum, developers can offer better services and goods.\n\nHoskinson invested his time towards Ethereum rather than merely money, similar to Lubin and Buterin. As a result, thanks to him and his enthusiasm for bitcoin initiatives, the network and cryptocurrency business are considerably more advanced today.

        "content": "Extreme cryptocurrency market fluctuations may be beneficial and harmful for investors and traders. Volatility creates opportunities for profits, but it may also result in losses. However, might use passive income strategies to mitigate these losses. During periods of market volatility, passive income opportunities allow Ethereum investors and traders to reduce losses. Even under challenging market\n\nExtreme cryptocurrency market fluctuations may be beneficial and harmful for investors and traders. Volatility creates opportunities for profits, but it may also result in losses. However, might use passive income strategies to mitigate these losses. During periods of market volatility, passive income opportunities allow Ethereum investors and traders to reduce losses.\n\nEven under challenging market conditions, such as bear markets, passive income schemes allow investors and traders to produce revenue. For investors in Ether (ETH $1,620) or any other cryptocurrency, passive crypto income is a way to weather market drops and collapses. In the past, owning crypto assets was the primary income source. Due to the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, there are presently several ways to promote interest in Ether and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This article is a guide for both novices and seasoned pros on how to create income using Ethereum.\n\nHow does Ethereum function? What is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain-based network that performs intelligent contracts. Ether, Ethereum\u2019s primary currency, allows users to undertake a wide range of functions on the web, including transactions, Staking, trading, storing nonfungible tokens (NFTs), playing games, and more. There is no possibility of fraud or meddling by a third party since these applications run as intended. Ethereum is also used to construct open-source blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApps). On Ethereum\u2019s network, anybody with the required skills and experience may build decentralized applications, making it one of the most popular platforms for developers. Historically, Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism was based on proof-of-work (PoW), which paid miners for verifying transaction blocks. At 1:42:42 a.m. EST on September 15, 2022, Ethereum switched to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus method.\n\nVitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum, referred to the historic transfer as The Merge and defined it as the first phase of a multi-year scaling strategy. The switch to PoS is intended to make Ethereum more scalable and energy-efficient by eliminating the need for miners, who use a great deal of energy to defend the network.\n\nHow can you use Ethereum to generate passive income?\n\nHere are some of the most popular passive income ideas for Ethereum:\n\nStaking\n\nIt locks funds on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain (such as Ethereum) to validate transactions and earn rewards. Speculators are compensated for their work with ETH or other coins. When users stake their ETH, they contribute to the network\u2019s security by putting their money where their mouth is.\n\nStaking Ethereum is a popular technique for generating passive income from cryptocurrencies, but it may be prohibitively expensive for new investors. To run a validator node and participate in Staking, the new PoS version of Ethereum requires a minimum of 32 ETH, or around $55,000. In addition to direct wagering, you may use service providers such as StakeWise and Lido. These decentralized apps (DApps) provide Ethereum staking services without needing network participants to maintain a full node, allowing them to stake with less capital. These companies often charge a 10% fee on incentives, which may diminish one\u2019s revenue, but initially, they are optional to deposit 32 ETH.\n\nAlso read: How Will Ethereum Merge Effect The Crypto Market?\n\nHodl\n\nHodl, a derivative of \u201chold\u201d that means \u201chang on for dear life,\u201d is crypto slang, meaning holding bitcoin for long-term financial objectives. When investors hodl Ether, they bet its price will increase in the future, letting them sell it for a profit. It is one of the most straightforward and prevalent ways to get passive income from cryptocurrencies. This strategy does not provide quick or assured gains, but it may be profitable in the long run if the price of Ether rises. Given that Ethereum has had tremendous growth since its inception and is now one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world, it is probable that its price will continue to rise in the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to keep in mind that the prices of cryptocurrencies are volatile and vulnerable to rapid swings. Consequently, investors should only spend as much as they are ready to lose.\n\nElectronic trading\n\nUsing a bot for automated Ether trading is a different method for generating passive income from Ethereum investments. Automated trading bots are computer programs that employ pre-programmed algorithms to buy and sell bitcoin 24 hours a day, seven days a week, on cryptocurrency exchanges. May configure these bots to execute trades automatically in response to market conditions such as price or volume swings. Coinrule and Bitsgap are examples of automated trading software allowing users to construct trading rules using established templates or modifying them based on risk choices.\n\nIf successful, automated trading may offer a steady revenue stream, but inherent risks are involved. Bots can make mistakes, such as selling or acquiring too early or too late. In addition, the bitcoin market is volatile and vulnerable to sudden movements that a bot may need help anticipating. Consequently, investors must routinely monitor their automated trading activity to avoid incurring substantial losses.\n\nLending\n\nLending is another frequent way for investors to get passive income from their ETH holdings. Typically, investors profit by lending borrowers cryptocurrencies at a high-interest rate which may be accomplished using either centralized or decentralized lending networks. Users often do not need to worry about technical issues such as centralized systems\u2019 security, data storage, bandwidth utilization, and authentication. The platform handles all technological factors and maximizes customer return on investment. Typically, centralized systems have higher interest rates than decentralized ones. Nevertheless, centralized systems are more susceptible to hacking and data breaches.\n\nDecentralized lending systems, on the other hand, offer clients a higher level of security, transparency, and customization, allowing skilled investors to improve their profit margins by modifying parameters. Frequently, these systems are more complicated to run and need a higher level of technical expertise. Moreover, loan rates are often lower under decentralized systems.\n\nLiquidity mining\n\nCreating passive income from Ethereum is also possible via liquidity mining or yield farming. By lending Ether or other assets to liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges such as Yearn.finance, SushiSwap, and Uniswap users receive rewards. In several yield farming systems, exchanging one token for another is possible inside a liquidity pool. Traders of cryptocurrencies pay a charge, which is then allocated to the farmers who have contributed to the liquidity pool. The size of the prize depends on the farmer\u2019s contribution to the liquidity of the whole collection. Yield farming is a relatively young profession, and it is adaptable. Furthermore, it may be a risky investment since the underlying assets\u2019 values may fluctuate rapidly, resulting in losses."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, finds itself perched precariously at the precipice of a substantial corrective phase, a development that has instilled palpable unease among market observers.\n\nThe situation has been further exacerbated by ARK\u2019s recent submission of an application for an Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This move has injected an additional layer of ambiguity into ETH\u2019s price trajectory, especially in light of the prospective synergy with a spot Bitcoin ETF, which could potentially exert a bullish influence on the value of decentralized finance (DeFi) assets.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of heightened uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics, the astute team at Finbold has turned to the deployment of machine learning algorithms via PricePredictions, a cryptocurrency monitoring and prognostication platform, on September 7. The primary aim was to discern the plausible price projection for ETH as the curtain falls in September, taking into account the most recent developments in the crypto arena.\n\nAccording to the rigorous analysis undertaken, the prognosis for ETH suggests a potential marginal downturn to $1,611 by the concluding day of September.\n\nETH 30-day forecast. Source: PricePredicitions\n\nETH technical analysis\n\nTurning our focus to the technical aspects of ETH, we observe its current trading price at $1,627, with a steadfast support level at $1,560 and a formidable resistance level situated at $1,702.\n\nOver the course of the day, ETH has undergone a slight 0.18% decline, and it has experienced a more pronounced 4.65% dip over the past week, encapsulating a cumulative market capitalization of $195 billion.\n\nEthereum 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nA telling tweet from cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, dated September 6 and shared on X (formerly Twitter), underscores the imminent concerns surrounding Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory. Martinez, in his missive, underscores the significance of Ethereum breaching the $1,680 threshold, as this could potentially serve as the gateway to a substantial corrective phase, ultimately driving the price down to the $1,200 range.\n\nIn an illuminating revelation, Martinez disseminated insights from the crypto analytical powerhouse, IntoTheBlock, which illuminated the scarcity of addresses engaged in Ethereum acquisitions within the price bracket of $1,285 to $1,681. This scarcity, juxtaposed with subdued activity at these price levels, augments the plausibility of a price regression to the $1,200 mark, as posited by Martinez.\n\nMeanwhile, the 1-day technical analysis (TA) gauges over at the crypto analytics website TradingView are bearish, their summary indicating a \u2018sell\u2019 at 15, as derived from moving averages (MA) pointing at a \u2018strong sell\u2019 at 14 and oscillators in the \u2018neutral\u2019 at 9.\n\nETH 1-day gauges. Source: TradingView\n\nTaking into account these factors, the machine predictions could, indeed, prove correct.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Ace hedge fund manager Cathie Woods\u2019 Ark Invest has filed for the listing of the first-ever spot Ethereum (ETH-USD) ETF (exchange-traded fund) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). ARK and cryptocurrency investment firm 21Shares are seeking to list a fund that will directly hold ether, which is the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The fund\u2019s proposed name is Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF, and it will be listed only in the American markets. The fund will custody the assets with crypto exchange Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN).\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector and asset managers worldwide have been trying for years to list a Bitcoin ETF. This is the first attempt by a fund to list an Ether ETF. Ark Invest\u2019s application for launching a Bitcoin ETF is still awaiting regulatory approval. Ark and 21Shares had applied to list the Bitcoin ETF on the Cboe BZX exchange.\n\nAll earlier attempts to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF have been rejected on grounds of inadequate surveillance. The SEC worries that spot cryptocurrency ETFs are vulnerable to fraud and manipulation owing to the absence of a proper regulatory framework and surveillance procedures. However, last month, the U.S. District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that the SEC\u2019s rejection of Grayscale Investment\u2019s application to list a bitcoin tracking ETF was incorrect. This major win has prompted several funds to list other bitcoin-tracking ETFs. Notably, the SEC is set to approve the first ETF based on Ether Futures by mid-October.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment?\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This proves its dominance and high trading ability in the crypto market. Currently, the price of ETH-USD is hovering around $1,636, representing a 66.7% discount from its all-time high. On November 10, 2021, ETH touched $4,865.94 thanks to the crypto boom. Even so, year-to-date, ETH has gained 35.6%.\n\nDisclosure"

The outlook leaves investors cautious and the circumspect could extend into the weekend, which is known for low trading volume.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC could revisit $21,000 as sell signals multiply ahead of US CPI.\n\nBitcoin price lacks directional bias, make-or-break support nearby\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is moving west, consolidating within a narrow range after breaking below a crucial support level during the August 17 crash. With weekends known to be rather lulled, the odds of a move north are slim unless large holders act.\n\nThe $24,995 support level is a \u2018make-or-break\u2019 for Bitcoin price. A decisive break below would send BTC to the psychological $24,000 and mark a bearish shift in trend. In the dire case, seller momentum could see the king of crypto hit $21,915, levels last seen around mid-March.\n\nBoth the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator and the RSI recently gave buy signals. The RSI rose out of oversold territory at the end of August and the MACD line crossed above its signal line in negative territory at the same time. Despite these signals only reflecting a brief dead-cat bounce in price that quickly fell back at the start of September, there is still a possibility of a recovery evolving.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA resurgence by the bulls could provide such an impetus for Bitcoin price, fueling a recovery to the upside. Such a move could send BTC above the 200-, 50-, and eventually the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $27,066, $27,414, and $27,763 levels before ultimately restoring above the support offered by the ascending trendline at $29,692.\n\nIn a highly ambitious case, Bitcoin price could foray into the zone above the psychological $30,000 before tagging $31,518. While the possibility for a northbound move remains bleak in the near term, it would constitute a 20% climb above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin all-time high in 2025?

The ascension could extend, possibly reaching the area where the 200- and 100-day EMAs appear to converge at $1,762 and $1,773, respectively.\n\nWith the right momentum, inspired by a strong move by Bitcoin, the price could see Ethereum price hit $1,841, an area last tested on August 15.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whales accumulate ETH as researchers explore scaling beyond EIP-4844.\n\nRipple price breaks out from a bearish trend, decisive?\n\nRipple (XRP) price has broken out from a descending parallel channel after the exhaustion blow-off move lower on August 17. These are both bullish signs that the downtrend has finished. Further confirmation would be provided should the remittance token record a daily candlestick close above the 200-day EMA at $0.5233.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nIf sidelined investors or late buyers come in, the increased buying momentum could see Ripple price tag, or in a highly bullish case, overcome the resistance presented by the confluence resistance area between the 100-day and 50-day EMAs at $0.5547 and $0.5580 levels respectively.\n\nOvercoming these hurdles could clear the way for Ripple price to reach the psychological $0.7000 level. This would indicate a 15% drop.\n\nFrom a bearish perspective, there is still a risk Ripple price could slip back below the upper boundary of the descending channel and potentially extend to the July 13 lows around $0.4600. This would represent an 8% fall. In a dire case, Ripple price could extend to the midline of the bearish technical formation at $0.4191.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price likely to slump as pro-XRP attorney Deaton analyzes the Howey memo and Hinman speech"

        "content": "The co-creator of Ethereum (ETH) is detailing a mechanism by which dishonest crypto users can be rooted out of crypto mixing protocols.\n\nIn a new paper, Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin and four additional authors detail how privacy pools can be useful in weeding out unscrupulous crypto traders.\n\nA privacy pool is a smart contract-based privacy project that lets users generate new ETH addresses not associated with their prior transactions.\n\nAs stated in the abstract of the paper,\n\n\u201cThe core idea of the proposal is to allow users to publish a zero-knowledge proof, demonstrating that their funds (do not) originate from (un)lawful sources without publicly revealing their entire transaction graph. This is achieved by proving membership in custom association sets that satisfy certain properties, required by regulation or social consensus.\u201d\n\nIn a lengthy thread, one of the co-authors of the paper, Ameen Soleimani of Privacy Pools, further explains how the protocol works and how it could help the issues experienced by users of sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash, which was deemed a national security threat in 2022 and banned in the US.\n\n\u201cPrivacy Pools is an open source project attempting to fix the most important flaw in Tornado Cash: Tornado Cash users were not able to provably dissociate from illicit funds \u2013 except by revealing their entire transaction history \u2013 which only a few did\u2026\n\nWith Privacy Pools, users can publish zero-knowledge proofs that their withdrawal originated from an \u2018association set\u2019 that excludes known illicit deposits. In theory, this allows users to prove regulatory compliance and still maintain privacy while using public blockchains.\u201d\n\nSoleimani says he plans on meeting with US regulators, such as the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), to see how the pools can be used to help bolster national security and combat money laundering.\n\nThe paper concludes that privacy and regulation may be compatible despite generally being perceived as contradictory.\n\n\u201cFor instance, suppose users can demonstrate that their funds have no ties to deposits from known illicit sources, or prove that the funds are part of a specific set of deposits, without revealing any further information.\n\nSuch a setup can generate a separating equilibrium, where honest users are strongly incentivized to prove membership in a given, compliant association set, while still enjoying privacy within that set. Conversely, for dishonest users, it is impossible to provide such a proof.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "REDMOND, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Metagood, the creators of OnChainMonkey (OCM), are the first to move a 10,000 NFT collection, OCM Genesis, from Ethereum, the nominal home of smart contracts, to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, the most decentralized and secure blockchain. The OCM DAO voted to financially subsidize some of the substantial cost of the large migration from Ethereum to Bitcoin.\n\nOn 30 August 2023, the OCM team proposed subsidizing the cost of this migration and making it free for all OCM Genesis NFT holders with a Bitcoin Badge. The Bitcoin Badge was rewarded to OCM holders who participated in missions that took about a year to complete.\n\nThe DAO proposal will award a subsidy of 350 ETH (approximately USD $570,787 currently) for the migration to Genesis, and reached a quorum of 2,000 votes within 24 hours and finished with over 4,700 votes cast in favor of the proposal. This is the highest number of votes any DAO proposal has received within 24 hours since OCM\u2019s DAO was founded in 2021. The proposal had nearly unanimous support, with 99% of voters supporting the migration to Bitcoin.\n\nThe vote was not assured and involved an education campaign on Bitcoin Ordinals and the new technical development of Recursive Inscriptions led by the Metagood leadership team, who proposed the migration idea and wrote the DAO proposal.\n\nImportantly, the OCM community subsidy doesn't cover all of the costs of migration, which amount to around $1M. Metagood is covering the rest of the cost for their community of holders.\n\n\u201cOur OCM community has conviction in our move to Bitcoin,\" said Metagood CEO and co-founder and OCM Genesis Collection creator Danny Yang. \"We have been involved with Ordinals since the beginning of the year, and the OCM community, in particular, has a great understanding of the potential and benefits of the migration to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\"A historical transition is on the horizon as we prepare to migrate our flagship collection, OCM Genesis, from Ethereum to Bitcoin. Inscribed in early February in inscription #20219, Genesis represents our firm belief in the promising future that awaits digital artifacts on Bitcoin,\u201d said Metagood co-founder and COO Amanda Terry. \u201cIt is remarkable that the DAO almost unanimously voted for the Ordinals technology that only emerged in February this year.\u201d\n\nIn truth, part of the vote likely reflects the faith in Metagood and OCM co-founder Danny Yang, who has been building on Bitcoin since founding Maicoin, his first Bitcoin company, in 2013 (the largest cryptocurrency company in Taiwan today), and early in building on Ordinals. Yang helped pioneer recursive inscriptions, creating 3D generative art on Bitcoin with the OCM Dimensions collection. The recursive inscription technology gives Bitcoin new powers, previously thought impossible without changing Bitcoin\u2019s core protocol. Now, complex programs can be stored and run from the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nRecursion and other features of Ordinals allow for an on-chain kind of NFTs referred to as Digital Artifacts. These are more secure and decentralized NFTs.\n\n\u201cA migration of this order of magnitude is a monumental milestone for our OCM Community and a first-of-its-kind migration and upgrade for a 10K collection,\" mentioned Danny Yang. \"The Genesis collection will have a ton of innovative features to its name and be on Block 9 Satoshis (sats), the first sats in circulation. They will be in sequential order, matching the sats, and have clear collection provenance on Bitcoin, and provenance going back to their origin on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nYang said further: \u201cIn the past, other projects have been paid a substantial amount of money to move to another blockchain. We are doing the opposite. We are so convinced in our move that we are spending more than $1M of our own resources to make the move to Bitcoin and in an important and innovative way.\u201d\n\nClearly, OCM DAO members believe in this truly decentralized future for digital assets on Bitcoin. OnChainMonkey will celebrate its 2 year anniversary of the launch of its Genesis collection on Ethereum this Monday, September 11.\n\nAbout OnChainMonkey\n\nOnChainMonkey, created by Metagood, is a pioneering digital art collection. It is the first NFT profile pic collection created on-chain in a single transaction on Ethereum in 2021. In 2023, OnChainMonkey made history again, becoming the first 10k collection inscribed on Bitcoin in inscription 20219. The collection of 10,000 generative art NFTs is led by an experienced team, including Danny Yang, who founded Taiwan\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Maicoin; Amanda Terry, who served as a digital media business development executive at Twitter and NBC; and Bill Tai, a legendary VC who was the first investor in Zoom and early investor in Canva, Dapper Labs as well as over 20 companies that have become publicly listed.

        "content": "Ethereum PoS staking surged since the Shanghai Upgrade and the Merge.\n\nStakers have had mildly realized losses in the last 365 days, but there could be a chance to stake more.\n\nThe number of Ethereum [ETH] staked reached 26.5 million on 6 September, according to Chain Afrik. Chain Afrik, which is an African-based blockchain community, coined the data from IntoTheBlock.\n\nAbout 26.5m $ETH has being staked, according to information from @intotheblock, the future is big for #ETHPOS pic.twitter.com/SeQY7kFv0a \u2014 Chain Afrik (@ChainAfrik) September 6, 2023\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nThis amount of ETH staked implied that the blockchain saw an increase in staking activity. One reason behind this was the Shapella upgrade, which was activated on 12 April.\n\nBillions and counting\n\nETH staking began in December 2020, through which participants could validate transactions and earn rewards for their contribution. As of March 2023, over $28 billion worth of the altcoin has been staked.\n\nHowever, most of the staked ETH were locked until the Shapella upgrade provided the avenue to unstake and stake at any given time.\n\nWhile the Shapella upgrade may have offered withdrawals, the main rationale for the hike is largely the Merge. The Ethereum Merge occurred in 2022 when the blockchain transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nAlthough not every section of the Ethereum community felt the decision was great, the rise in ETH staked seemed to have proved that notion wrong. As such, the Ethereum PoS future could be greater than it was when it operated on the PoW like Bitcoin [BTC].\n\nSince the PoS transition laid the foundation for staking assets, the number of validators has crossed the 800,000-mark.\n\nDownsides and an opportunity\n\nWith a netflow of 6.92 million ETH since Shanghai, liquid staking activity has also increased. According to Dune Analytics, Lido Finance [LDO] boasted a 32.42% market share in the sector at press time.\n\nOther projects including Rocket Pool [RPL], Binance [BNB], and Coinbase [COIN] also increased their participation. At the time of writing, Binance\u2019s market share was 4.50% while Coinbase stood at 8.59%.\n\nBut how profitable has ETH staking been, and is this a good time to jump into the staking game? Well, two metrics could answer this question. First is the ETH stakers\u2019 realized value. The second metric to consider is the ETH stakers\u2019 Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV).\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe ETH stakers\u2019 realized value captures the average price at which the entire ETH staking supply moved on-chain. At the time of writing, the metric had increased to 27.51 billion. This means that there is a large difference between the realized price for deposits and the spot price.\n\nAdditionally, ETH stakers\u2019 365-day MVRV was down to -9.76%. The decrease in this metric implies more of a realized loss for validators. However, it also seems to present an opportunity to increase deposits in case ETH\u2019s value rallies in the future."

        "title": "Ethereum Co-Founder\u2019s Privacy Pools: A Solution for Blockchain Compliance - CoinTrust",
        "content": "In a groundbreaking development, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, along with four co-authors, has introduced a novel concept known as \u201cprivacy pools\u201d to discern between lawful and illicit activities on the blockchain. The proposal, unveiled in a research paper titled \u201cBlockchain Privacy and Regulatory Compliance: Towards a Practical Equilibrium,\u201d published on Wednesday, aims to address the escalating concerns surrounding privacy within blockchain technology. Governments have been intensifying their efforts to combat criminal organizations employing privacy mixers to obscure and launder their ill-gotten funds.\n\nA Response to Growing Privacy Concerns\n\nThe emergence of this privacy-enhancing protocol is a direct response to the pressing need to distinguish between transactions associated with criminal activity and those conducted by honest users on the blockchain. Notably, the privacy protocol Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer, incurred sanctions from the U.S. Treasury due to its alleged use by the North Korean hacking group Lazarus for money laundering. While Tornado Cash has been effective in tackling privacy issues, it has faced limitations in disassociating itself from criminal activities on the network.\n\nAddressing the Limitations of Existing Solutions\n\nPrivacy pools hold the potential to address these limitations by providing users with transaction data privacy while concurrently separating it from any criminal activity. The core idea revolves around aggregating honest transactions, enabling users to validate that their transactions stem from the pool of honest deposits.\n\nThe research paper elaborates, \u201cAll users with \u2018good\u2019 assets have strong incentives and the ability to prove their membership in a \u2018good\u2019-only association set,\u201d making it challenging for \u201cbad actors\u201d to furnish such evidence. This mechanism ensures that transactions originating from legitimate sources are shielded by privacy, while those with nefarious intentions are exposed.\n\nA Step Towards Regulatory Compliance\n\nAs regulatory bodies worldwide intensify their efforts to combat criminal activities on the blockchain, Buterin aims to demonstrate that technological innovations like privacy pools can align with regulatory requirements. The authors assert that privacy and regulatory compliance have often been viewed as incompatible concepts. However, by enabling users to prove specific attributes regarding the source of their funds, the proposed privacy-enhancing protocol may challenge this notion.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s introduction of privacy pools represents a significant stride in blockchain technology, addressing the critical issue of privacy while complying with regulatory mandates. The concept offers a potential solution to the challenges associated with distinguishing lawful transactions from criminal ones on the blockchain. As governments continue their pursuit of greater transparency in blockchain transactions, innovations like privacy pools provide a path toward reconciling privacy and regulatory compliance in the digital age."

        "content": "A new research paper led by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin proposes \u201cPrivacy Pools,\u201d a novel approach to balance privacy protections and regulatory compliance in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe paper outlines how Privacy Pools allows users to prove their crypto withdrawals do not originate from illicit sources without revealing their complete transaction histories. Users can generate zero-knowledge proofs demonstrating their withdrawals are associated with approved \u201csets\u201d of past deposits.\n\nPrivacy pools.\n\nAccording to the paper, this voluntary disclosure system incentivizes honest users to dissociate themselves from criminals. By excluding suspicious actors from their association sets, legitimate users can signal regulatory compliance while still preserving privacy within their sets.\n\nPublic blockchains like Buterin\u2019s Ethereum are pseudonymous, meaning transactions are publicly viewable but not directly tied to real-world identities. Privacy-enhancing protocols like Tornado Cash obscure the source of funds but have enabled crime by obstructing oversight.\n\nPrivacy Pools aim to balance openness for regulators with user anonymity. The paper argues that the protocol is adaptable enough to satisfy different global regulations by letting users customize their association set disclosures.\n\nButerin has long advocated for \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d in cryptocurrencies while maintaining personal privacy. This research represents his latest effort to promote constructive dialogue between crypto developers, regulators, and policymakers.\n\nThe Ethereum founder co-authored the paper with researchers from the University of Basel and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich.\n\nInclusion and exclusion sets.\n\nButerin and colleagues detail two primary strategies for constructing association sets in the paper. The \u201cinclusion\u201d method involves only low-risk deposits based on criteria like transaction screening tools or membership in trusted communities.\n\nAlternatively, the \u201cexclusion\u201d method entails leaving out known suspicious deposits but keeping all other activity as potential sources. The paper provides examples of how both approaches allow legal users to prove they are not associated with illegal funds.\n\nThe researchers argue association sets should aim to be accurate, stable over time, and large enough to provide meaningful privacy. However, satisfying all criteria may require tradeoffs.\n\nWhile supportive of the Privacy Pools concept, Buterin and co-authors caution against centralized parties overseeing access. They argue this raises governance concerns and could enable data monopolies.\n\nThe paper says additional research is needed to thoroughly analyze the privacy guarantees, incentives, and legal compliance requirements of Privacy Pools.\n\nThe Privacy Pools paper represents Buterin\u2019s latest foray into encouraging productive cooperation between the crypto industry and regulators. With thoughtful design, he argues, blockchains can meet policy goals without sacrificing user privacy."

        "content": "Shiba Inu burn tracker asserts that SHIB\u2019s meteoric rise in 2021 was not a direct result of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s burn but a result of demand.\n\nShibburn, the community-driven Shiba Inu burn tracker, recently set the record straight regarding the influence of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s burn of 410.2 trillion SHIB on the asset\u2019s past rally.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Shibburn asserted in a post that it was the growing demand that ignited SHIB\u2019s meteoric rise in 2021 and not necessarily Vitalik\u2019s burn.\n\nJust to clarify something on Vitalik Buterin's burn. He did not spend $1.7B in $SHIB to burn on May 2021 for it to have any effect on price then. That was given to him when the token was deployed. Transferring 90% of what was given to him from one wallet to another (burn address)\u2026 pic.twitter.com/QCpRAnlIwz \u2014 Shibburn (@shibburn) September 6, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe burn tracker clarified that Vitalik did not spend $1.7 billion to incinerate SHIB tokens so that the burn could impact the price at the time. Note that the value of the 410 trillion tokens now stands at $3.1 billion as of press time.\n\nShibburn emphasized that Buterin received the SHIB tokens when the token was initially deployed, and transferring a portion of them to a burn address months later did not directly impact the token\u2019s price positively.\n\nThe community-driven burn tracker stressed that the surge in May 2021 was not solely the result of Buterin\u2019s burn but rather a reflection of the growing interest and investment in SHIB from the broader crypto community.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThis substantial demand, combined with the fact that half of the token\u2019s supply was already under the custody of Vitalik Buterin, likely contributed to the asset\u2019s extraordinary price appreciation.\n\nShiba Inu Previous Rally\n\nAn accompanying CoinMarketCap chart substantiates these claims. Notably, data from the chart shows that SHIB had already increased by 29,151,160% from a low of $0.000000000119 on Jan. 1, 2021, to a high of $0.00003469 on May 11, 2021.\n\nThis remarkable growth occurred before Vitalik Buterin\u2019s burn, indicating that SHIB\u2019s rally was well underway before this event occurred.\n\nHowever, following the initial rally, Shiba Inu experienced a temporary setback, retracing from the previous high. Buterin\u2019s burn occurred on May 16 during this correction phase.\n\nThe burn did little to stop the correction, with SHIB\u2019s price declining to $0.00000621 in June 2021. Nevertheless, the asset bounced back, surging 1,324% from that point to reach an all-time high of $0.00008845 in October 2021.\n\nShibburn pointed out that Shiba Inu is up over 46M% since 2020 but only 5x since May 6, 2021. This reality further confirms that the asset\u2019s meteoric rally occurred before the burn.\n\nShiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama previously made similar remarks on the back of calls for sustained burns. According to Kusama, burns alone cannot trigger a massive SHIB rally but utility and demand."

Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has co-authored a new research paper exploring how a privacy-preserving blockchain protocol could balance the need for user anonymity with regulatory compliance.\n\nThe paper, co-authored by Buterin along with early Tornado Cash contributor Ameen Soleimani, Jacob Illum from the blockchain security firm Chainalysis, and two researchers from the University of Basel, delves into the subject of establishing a neutral infrastructure to incorporate privacy into blockchain transactions.\n\nIt builds upon the concept of the Privacy Pools protocol, introduced by Soleimani in March 2023. This protocol, a fork of Tornado Cash, aims to improve its model to include regulatory compliance.\n\nPrivacy Pool operates similarly to Tornado Cash by mixing multiple user transactions to obscure their true origins. However, when users choose to withdraw funds, they have the option to generate a zero-knowledge proof.\n\nThe zero-knowledge proof confirms that they are not utilizing a criminal blockchain address while safeguarding their identity.\n\nThe new research paper seeks to strike a balance between Privacy Pool-like protocols and compliance with various regulatory and practical considerations by covering various hypothetical use cases.\n\nSoleimani commented on the paper that they did their best to explain \u201chow Privacy Pools tech can serve as neutral infrastructure for bringing public blockchains into regulatory compliance\u2014across jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nThe researchers \u201cdescribe the infrastructure on top of, and the consequences of, this simple core mechanic,\u201d the article read.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBuilding regulatory compliant privacy\n\nA crucial topic of discussion revolves around the creation of \u201cassociation sets,\u201d representing a group of wallets connected via zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nThe researchers introduced the concept of association set providers (ASPs), tasked with generating association sets.\n\nAn excerpt from the paper states that, \"In some instances, ASPs can be entirely constructed on-chain, requiring no human (or AI) intervention. Alternatively, ASPs may independently generate association sets and subsequently publish them on-chain.\"\n\nThe researchers also address centralization concerns in pool management while striving to maintain regulatory compliance.\n\nFurthermore, the authors have sought insights from legal experts to assist in tailoring the protocol and its surrounding ecosystem to \u201censure compliance across various legal jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nTornado Cash, a coin mixer, was sanctioned by the U.S. government last year over allegations that it facilitated transactions for the North Korea-linked hacking group Lazarus. The Federal Court reaffirmed the sanctions in a recent ruling.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice recently charged two founders of the Ethereum-based application with money laundering charges and arrested one of the co-founders."

        "content": "WisdomTree has adjusted the strategy of the WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETP, enabling the ETP to generate yield from the staking of its underlying ether tokens.\n\nEther is the second-largest cryptocurrency globally and the native token for the Ethereum blockchain, a well-established, open-ended decentralized platform and the leading venue for the deployment of smart contracts.\n\nThe WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETP is 100% backed by ether, offering institutional investors easy access to one of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrencies through a liquid, regulated vehicle without the technical challenges of setting up private keys or crypto wallets.\n\nThe ETP\u2019s underlying ether tokens are custodied between Swissquote Bank and Coinbase Custody. According to WisdomTree, this multi-custodian model serves to provide greater liquidity for the underlying digital currency.\n\nStaking is a way of earning rewards for holding certain cryptocurrencies that work on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism \u2013 Ethereum switched to a proof-of-stake mechanism in 2022 in a major upgrade aimed at making the network more secure, less energy-intensive, and better at implementing new scaling solutions.\n\nProof-of-stake mechanisms put their underlying cryptocurrency to work in verifying and securing transactions on the blockchain. Investors who choose to take part in this process \u2018stake\u2019 their cryptocurrency holdings and earn rewards for doing so.\n\nAccording to WisdomTree, the staking return attributable to ether is expected to vary between 4% and 8%.\n\nThe WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETP will remain 100% physically backed at all times as the staked ether tokens do not move from the secure custodians where they are stored.\n\nThe ETP is listed on Deutsche B\u00f6rse Xetra (Ticker: WETH GY) in euros, on Euronext Amsterdam (ETHW NA) in US dollars, and on SIX Swiss Exchange (ETHW SW) in US dollars, euros, or Swiss francs.\n\nIt comes with an expense ratio of 0.95%, making the ETP one of the cheapest in Europe for obtaining directly backed ether exposure.\n\nMirva Anttila, Director, Digital Assets Research, WisdomTree, commented: \u201cThe Shapella upgrade was a major advancement for the Ethereum network, completing Ethereum\u2019s full transition to proof-of-stake and enabling the withdrawal of staked ether and related staking rewards. There are many challenges in providing staking rewards to investors; however, these have been overcome and we are now able to deliver staking rewards to investors through a risk-managed approach.\u201d\n\nAlexis Marinof, Head of Europe, WisdomTree, added: \u201cStaking has the potential to make investing in cryptocurrencies more attractive for investors. We have made a commitment to build and enhance products that align with our investors\u2019 needs. This means continuing to innovate and evolve with the market so that we can deliver a best-in-class institutional-grade crypto product range. However, this should never be at the expense of security and risk management, and this is at the centre of our staking approach.\u201d"

Just banning cryptocurrency won't eliminate its risks, a joint policy roadmap published by global standard setters Thursday said.\n\n\n\nA joint policy paper on crypto published by the IMF and FSB warned jurisdictions against implementing blanket bans to mitigate risks associated with the sector, and recommended targeted restrictions and sound monetary policy instead. Targeted restrictions might come in handy for emerging economies in particular, it said.\n\n\n\nBitcoin posted smart gains on Friday as the largest crypto token rose more than 2 per cent to regain $26,300-levels. Its largest peer, Ethereum, also moved about a per cent up to hover around $1,650-mark. Price action in the altcoins remained on the positive lines with mild gains.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's value is currently trading around the $26,200 level. This positive price movement might be because of a paper that came out yesterday from the IMF and the G20\u2019s Financial Stability Board, said Edul Patel, CEO & Co-Founder at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"The paper said that banning all cryptocurrencies wouldn't work well in the long term and suggested using targeted restrictions and a comprehensive monetary strategy instead. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trading above the $1600 level,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading slightly higher on Friday. However, the gains were capped. Other than Bitcoin, Solana gained about 2 per cent. BNB, Polkadot and Litecoin added about a per cent each. Among the losers, Toncoin and Polygon shed about 2 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising to $1.05 trillion-mark, as it gained more than one per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped as much as 7 per cent to $24.98 billion.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has picked up for the second consecutive day. The fear and greed index also jumped 5 points since yesterday and is currently in the fear zone with a score of 46/100. Most of the top 10 cryptos by market capitalization are trading in the green, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\n\n\"The investor sentiment seems to have been slightly boosted after news about JPMorgan exploring a blockchain-based payment and settlement system,\" he added. \"The much-awaited synthesis paper that has been jointly prepared by FSB and IMF was published for the public yesterday, which underlines the importance of a global regulatory framework.\"\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nEthereum is currently attempting a rebound after failing to break the $1,675 resistance level.After recording short-term gains last month, the asset has declined 9.2% since mid-August.The price action has been registering short line candles in the daily chart, indicating that ETH will continue moving sideways in medium term.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-ETH\n\n\n\nThe asset is currently trading below its 20-day moving average of $1,670 which acts as an immediate resistance level.Its RSI reading is currently at 40, slightly in oversold territory.If ETH is unable to break through the $1,700 barrier this week, the price may consolidate around $1,650 levels for a while.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,625,$1,585\n\nResistance: $1,670, $1,700, $1,735\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

A new block is generated every two seconds, and a KRO is minted and distributed to users and dApps as rewards. As their level of participation is determined by the number of their transactions, dApps and users that generated more transactions will receive more tokens. This reward system will induce active ecosystem expansion activities, thus creating a virtuous circle.\n\n25% of KRO will be distributed to the WEMIX Foundation and WEMIX community, contributing to the WEMIX ecosystem.\n\nKroma will start as a chain for game-onboarding, and Night Crows will be serviced on the chain. The global blockchain version of the smash hit MMORPG, published by Wemade, is slated to be released this December. Lightscale aims to expand its ecosystem to include everything web3, such as DeFi and NFT. Part of Kroma\u2019s Ecosystem Fund will be granted to onboarding dApps to encourage joining its ecosystem.\n\nLearn more about Kroma at https://kroma.network/\n\n\n\nAbout WEMADE\n\nA renowned industry leader in game development with over 20 years of experience, Korea-based WEMADE is leading a once-in-a-generation shift as the gaming industry pivots to blockchain technology. Through its WEMIX subsidiary, WEMADE aims to accelerate the mass adoption of blockchain technology by building an experience-based, platform-driven, and service-oriented mega-ecosystem to offer a wide spectrum of intuitive, convenient, and easy-to-use Web3 services.

        "title": "Why Bitrock Is One of Best Scaling Solutions for Ethereum Network - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "Bitrock takes the lead among Ethereum sidechains and layer-2 networks with great features that significantly improve ETH scalability.\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and one of the world\u2019s most popular crypto assets. However, like a few other blockchains, the Ethereum network is plagued with its fair share of limitations that hamper its growth and adoption. Over the years, this problem has motivated developers and blockchain engineers to create solutions in the form of sidechains or layer-2 (L2) blockchains. Sidechains and L2 blockchains help to extend the capabilities of Layer-1 (L1) blockchains like Ethereum and improve scalability.\n\nThere are several L2 networks and sidechains that enhance L1 blockchains. One of the most effective sidechains for the ETH network is the Bitrock blockchain. In July 2023, Bitrock had a stealth launch that, unlike other options, had no private sale or presale. The sidechain is now a contender in the ETH space with the following advantages working in its favor:\n\nOriginality: The Bitrock blockchain is original. Unlike some other options that forked out of running blockchains, the Bitrock team created the network and built it piece by piece. This means that Bitrock can operate as it deems fit and offer unmatched efficiency without any limitations as may be present in forked networks.\n\nPoA: Instead of using proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS), Bitrock uses the proof-of-authority consensus algorithm, which enables authorized entities to validate transactions. Using PoA makes Bitrock faster, cheaper, more secure, and more scalable than other options.\n\nCheap Gas Fees and Fast Transactions: Bitrock is effective with scaling the Ethereum blockchain as it boasts a 2-second block time and up to 12,000 transactions per second. In addition, gas fees on Bitrock are meager, costing $0.00001 per transaction.\n\nAudit: Bitrock has completed a CTDSEC blockchain and contract audit. The team engaged CTDSec to audit its infrastructure and find security flaws in design and implementation. According to CTDSec, Bitrock passed all tests with no issues.\n\nKYC Verification: Bitrock\u2019s core team has gone through a know-your-customer (KYC) process with Assure DeFi, a high-level service that has worked with the US Attorney\u2019s Office, the FBI, and several other government entities and jurisdictions.\n\nSimple Tokenomics: Bitrock\u2019s tokenomics feature total supply equal to the token\u2019s circulating supply. There are no locked or vested tokens and no plans for dilution. Consequently, investors, stakeholders, and members of the Bitrock community can rest assured that what they see is what they get.\n\nService Expansion: Bitrock will continuously onboard new features to provide better offerings to users. As part of its roadmap, Rockswap, Bitrock\u2019s live official chain DEX, plans to support multiple chains. Upon implementation, users can use Rockswap to trade tokens on native chains like ETH but pay gas in native Bitrock instead. Rockswap has been very successful so far, moving its market cap to $1.6 million from $5,000 in only three minutes. Also, in its first 24 hours, Rockswap\u2019s volume hit $1.8 million.\n\nToken Builder: Bitrock created an in-house token builder that anyone can use to launch a token using a standard preloaded contract. Bitrock has made this process easy, as interested persons can use this tool without any technical or coding knowledge.\n\nAttractive Staking: Users can also enjoy impressive returns from staking on Bitrock. On the Ethereum side, stakers get a 30% annual percentage yield (APY), and 60% on its mainnet. More than 40% of the entire token supply is currently staked on both sides combined.\n\nIntegrations: For improved and flexible service offers, Bitrock has completed integrations with several tools and platforms, including Bitmart, Dextools, Dexview, Gechoterminal, Pinksale, Avedex, and Trustwallet. There are also integrations with Sphynx Labs and all of its dApp and ecosystem utilities, with Dexscreener and other wallet integrations launching soon.\n\nThe Bitrock sidechain has several existing impressive features and many more in the offing. The L2 network will compete favorably with other L2 ETH options, especially with its impressive security measures, transaction speed, transparency, and its already remarkable list of integrations."

        "content": "Over recent times, the market has displayed weaker signs of recovery, much to the chagrin of bullish analysts. While hopes and speculations are high, the cold hard numbers display a negative sentiment currently prevailing in the market. Today, we dive deep into the price analysis of four major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano, attempting to forecast their short to medium-term trajectories.\n\nCrypto Price Prediction as of September 9th, 2023\n\nThe crypto market has been navigating through turbulent waters. With a current market cap standing at $1.02 trillion, the volume over the past 24 hours has touched $26.1 billion. For perspective, the market cap was notably higher at $1.15 trillion just last month. A silver lining, however, emerges when we look at the past three weeks. The consolidation around the $1.05 trillion mark has been solid, signifying a resilient support price level for the entire crypto market.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction Today\n\nBitcoin, often referred to as the \u2018king of cryptos,\u2019 has been facing downward pressure. At present, the BTC price stands at $25,730, marking a decline of 5.4% over the past week. The silver lining here is the stability it has shown in the past 24 hours. The ongoing price is acting as a formidable support level. However, if a massive crypto crash were to occur, Bitcoin could potentially drop to the much-dreaded $20,000 price point.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin\u2019s chart and the total market cap chart, we can notice a clear correlation in price movements. This is normal as Bitcoin has a significant 48% market dominance. Bitcoin prices also affect other altcoins.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction Today\n\nEthereum is not far behind in terms of price fluctuations. Its current value is pegged at $1,630, which is a 4.2% dip since last week. Much like Bitcoin, Ethereum has shown resilience in the past 24 hours with the price holding steady. The standing price for Ethereum is critical as a support level. If the crypto world were to see a downturn, we might witness the price plummeting to $1,400 and potentially even $1,200 should the circumstances worsen.\n\nXRP Price Prediction Today\n\nXRP\u2019s ongoing scenario is quite intriguing. Currently valued at $0.49, it has seen a 4.9% decline over the last week. A concerning observation is XRP crossing below the psychological support of $0.50. If this downtrend persists, the next potential support levels could be at $0.45 and, in a worst-case scenario, $0.40.\n\nCardano Price Prediction Today\n\nLastly, Cardano, another formidable player in the crypto domain, has its current price listed at $0.25, reflecting a 3.3% dip since last week. Just like its counterparts, Cardano too has demonstrated stability over the past day. The $0.25 mark is an essential support level for ADA. However, should there be a broad crypto crash, Cardano might dip to a value as low as $0.20.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "title": "Ether Whales\u2019 Offloading Sparks Concerns of Asset\u2019s Price Trajectory - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum continued to trade in the volatile waters of the cryptocurrency market last week, with a deeper analysis revealing that some big players may be offloading their bags.\n\nFor most of last month, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization traded around $1,600, reflecting weeklong fluctuations after a sudden drop earlier this month that left investors and analysts questioning its immediate trajectory.\n\nNotably, the actions of Ethereum whales or entities that possess substantial quantities of the cryptocurrency have prompted both intrigue and apprehension within the crypto community.\n\nOver the weekend, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to Twitter to share his insights. In a tweet, he highlighted a compelling correlation between the number of whales holding 10,000 or more ETH and the overall price movement of the asset.\n\n\u201cNotice the strong correlation between the number of whales holding 10,000+ ETH and its price trajectory. If seasoned investors are offloading, it prompts the question: Is now the right time to buy or to short ETH?\u201d wrote Martinez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartinez\u2019s observation underlines these significant holders\u2019 influence over Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics. Martinez went on to make a compelling remark, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be watching these whales closely before I buy ETH!\u201d\n\nThe decision of established investors to liquidate portions of their holdings raises concerns about a potential downward trajectory. Yet, it also opens doors for those seeking strategic entry points into the market.\n\nNotably, the analyst\u2019s sentiments appear to have influenced his trading strategy. In a separate tweet, Martinez revealed another noteworthy metric in the cryptocurrency realm: the Ethereum MVRV Ratio.\n\nCompared to the 180-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), this ratio offers insights into broader market trends. The MVRV Ratio surpassing the 180-day SMA historically indicates macro uptrends, while a ratio below suggests potential downtrends. Martinez shared an image showing the recent decline in ETH\u2019s price led to the MVRV Ratio dipping beneath the 180-day SMA, raising caution flags for bullish investors.\n\nThat said, Ethereum\u2019s ongoing battle to breach the $1,700 resistance has intensified the focus on the critical $1,630 support level. Should this level be breached, the price could plunge toward approximately $1,440, a threshold aligned with a significant daily support trend line.\n\nConversely, a successful close above the $1,700 mark could propel Ethereum\u2019s value beyond the $2,000 milestone. On the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s price continues to perch above the ascending 200-week moving average, while a bottoming-out of the daily RSI introduces a hidden bullish divergence, albeit with prudent caution."

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest and asset manager 21Shares made a significant move in the ETF space after applying for the first spot, Ethereum ETF, in the US.\n\nArk Invest, under the leadership of Cathie Wood and 21Shares, made waves this week by filing an application for the first spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the ETF, dubbed the \u201cArk 21Shares Ethereum ETF,\u201d was filed on Wednesday and named Coinbase as its custodian.\n\nFirst Spot Ethereum ETF in the US\n\nArk Invest and 21Shares applied for the first spot Ethereum ETF in the United States. The asset managers await approval from the SEC for an ETF that would directly hold ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nThe application resembled the recent string of spot Bitcoin ETFs that have been delayed by the SEC. The securities agency said it needed more time to decide on the recent ETF filings after Grayscale secured a courtroom victory last week. Grayscale was victorious in its lawsuit against the SEC over the agency\u2019s reasoning for failing to approve spot ETFs. The judge ruled in favour of Grayscale as the SEC could not fully explain how futures ETFs materially differed from spot ETFs.\n\nIn its filing, Ark Invest names Coinbase Custody Trust Company as its custodian. The crypto exchange would be responsible for holding Ethereum backing the shares of Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF. If approved, the ETF would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nSEC Receives Futures-Based Ethereum ETF Filings\n\nThe securities agency received previous filings for Ethereum futures ETFs but has yet to approve any. Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, recently commented on the state of these futures ETFs. He said:\n\n\u201cIn the past, the SEC has told Ether Futures ETF filers to withdraw 5-6 days after the first filing hit. We are now on Day 13 and no withdrawals. Not home free yet, but very good sign. As we predicted these will likely hit market in mid-October.\u201d\n\nArk Invest\u2019s application, however, goes a step further, resembling applications of recent Bitcoin spot ETFs. Futures-based Bitcoin ETFs have traded in the US since ProShares launched its futures ETF on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021.\n\nArk Invest, 21Shares Apply for Futures ETH ETF\n\nLast week, it was revealed that Ark Invest and 21Shares joined forces to apply for a futures-based Ethereum ETF.\n\nPer recent SEC filings, Ark Invest and 21Shares proposed the ARK 21Shares Active Ethereum Futures ETF (ARKZ) and the Ark 21Shares Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF (ARKY).\n\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum And Cosmos Compatible With A City, South Korea Wants To Make It Happen - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "A local report confirmed that Busan, the second most populous city in South Korea, plans to use the Ethereum and Cosmos for its project \u201cBlockchain City.\u201d The Asian city has been developing its blockchain capabilities for a while and plans to double down on its efforts.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Blockchain City To Operate On Ethereum And Cosmos\n\nThe report claims the project is expected to be completed by 2026 as part of the Busan Digital Asset Exchange (BDAE) and Future Schedule Plan. The South Korean city has been experimenting with different implementations of blockchain technology.\n\nBusan is looking for ways to offer services, such as digital vouchers and others, and for ways businesses can operate on the blockchain. However, the experiments hit an obstacle due to the difference between the networks and \u201cuncomfortable user experience (UX).\u201d\n\nAs crypto users know, operating on Ethereum and its many sidechains differs greatly from applications running on Cosmos, Cardano, Tezos, Solana, and other networks. These blockchains have transaction costs and speed and require tools many are unwilling to master.\n\nTherefore, Busan decided to concentrate on Ethereum and Cosmos to standardize its blockchain initiatives. Implementing this \u201cBlockchain City\u201d will cost around 100 billion Korean won or $74 million US dollars. The project will operate around the BDAE.\n\nBusan City\u2019s Efforts To Contribute With Blockchain Technology\n\nAccording to the report, the BDAE was launched in November 2022 but is yet to roll out operations. The company will disclose its business plans in an upcoming event this November.\n\nThe trading venues will provide users access to commodities, raw materials, and other assets via tokenized products. In the long term, the BDAE plans also to offer access to other assets, including tokenized global intellectual property (IP) rights.\n\nTokenized assets and related financial products have been gaining attention from different sectors. Banks, exchanges, and financial service providers have noted the potential benefits of implementing these products.\n\nIn a paper published on September 8, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) stated the following regarding the potential benefits of tokenization:\n\nthe programmability of crypto tokens and the ability to leverage smart contracts, allows for additional features that can be embedded into the tokenized asset which might also benefit markets for the underlying reference assets. For example, liquidity saving mechanisms could be implemented in the settlement of the tokenized asset even if they are not implementable for its real-world counterpart.26 These attributes might lower barriers to entry for a wider set of investors, resulting in more competitive and liquid markets, and better price discovery.\n\nIn addition to the \u201cBlockchain City\u201d and the BDAE, Busan will launch a blockchain innovation fund. The initiative will support the development of blockchain technology and related infrastructure.\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum (ETH) trades at around $1,600 and faces considerable selling pressure on short timeframes.\n\nCover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview"

        "title": "How Has the Boba Network Taken the Ethereum Ecosystem by Storm? - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "In blockchain technology, scalability has remained a constant challenge, and Ethereum, as one of the leading blockchain platforms, is no exception. High gas fees and network congestion have posed significant hurdles to its mainstream adoption.\n\nEnter the Boba Network, a game-changer in Ethereum\u2019s scalability journey. Boba Network is not just another Layer-2 solution; it\u2019s an Optimistic rollup that has taken the Ethereum ecosystem by storm. By leveraging cutting-edge Optimistic rollup technology, Boba Network addresses the pressing concerns of high transaction fees, sluggish throughput, and limited smart contract capabilities. Supported by Enya, a leading decentralized infrastructure solutions provider, Boba Network offers users an alternative network that combines low fees with Ethereum\u2019s unmatched security.\n\nThis Cryptopolitan guide dives into the intricacies of Boba Network, from its architecture and token economics to its burgeoning ecosystem and the competitive landscape it faces. Join us as we explore how Boba Network is poised to reshape the Ethereum experience and drive the future of blockchain scalability.\n\nBoba Network Overview\n\nBoba Network stands as a formidable Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution, harnessing the power of Optimistic rollup technology. Supported by Enya, a prominent player in decentralized infrastructure solutions, Boba Network has been in operation since its mainnet launch in September 2021. The primary objective of this platform is crystal clear: to substantially reduce transaction fees, bolster transaction throughput, and elevate the capabilities of smart contracts operating within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nOperating as a Layer-2 scaling solution, Boba Network leverages the principles of Optimistic rollup technology to optimize its performance. This methodology involves bundling multiple transactions into a single transaction on Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1, effectively distributing the associated transaction fees across the participants in this consolidated transaction. The net result is a remarkable reduction in gas fees, often by a factor of 100, offering users an economical and efficient alternative for conducting transactions while ensuring the security of the Ethereum network.\n\nEnya, a trailblazing decentralized infrastructure solutions company, has been instrumental in Boba Network\u2019s development and support. Founded in 2018, Enya has earned recognition as a leading provider of multiparty computation services, serving a user base exceeding 10 million across 91 countries. The collaboration between Enya and Boba Network has birthed a promising Layer-2 solution poised to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges.\n\nBoba Network\u2019s emergence on the scene signaled a significant stride in Ethereum\u2019s quest for enhanced scalability and efficiency. By lowering fees, amplifying transaction throughput, and empowering smart contracts, Boba Network has marked itself as a crucial player in Ethereum\u2019s evolving ecosystem. Its utilization of Optimistic rollup technology ensures a secure and streamlined experience for users, promising a future where Ethereum\u2019s scalability concerns are alleviated.\n\nArchitecture\n\nBoba Network\u2019s architecture is a testament to its commitment to optimizing Ethereum\u2019s capabilities through the utilization of Optimistic rollup technology. This technical infrastructure has several key components that work together to enhance the network\u2019s efficiency and security.\n\nOptimistic Rollup Approach\n\nAt its core, Boba Network employs Optimistic rollups, operating under the assumption that transactions are valid unless explicitly challenged. This approach significantly expedites transaction processing, as only contested transactions require verification.\n\nSequencers and Transaction Bundling\n\nTo facilitate the transfer of data between Layer-2 and Ethereum\u2019s Layer-1, Boba Network relies on sequencers. These sequencers play a pivotal role in bundling multiple transactions into a single batch, which is then submitted to Ethereum via a single transaction. However, it\u2019s important to note that, at present, fraud proofs, which would challenge the assumption of transaction validity, have not been enabled within the network.\n\nQuick Exit Mechanism\n\nOne notable feature of Boba Network is its swap-based mechanism, designed to enable rapid exits from the network back to Ethereum. This mechanism offers users the option to bypass the conventional seven-day withdrawal period associated with Optimistic rollups. While providing this convenience, the mechanism imposes a small convenience fee, which is then distributed as an incentive to liquidity providers.\n\nHybrid Compute Functionality\n\nThe introduction of the Hybrid Compute feature has significantly expanded Boba Network\u2019s capabilities. This feature empowers smart contracts within the network to interact seamlessly with external systems, effectively acting as a conduit between Boba Network\u2019s sequencer and external APIs. It allows smart contracts to execute complex algorithms, including machine learning classifiers, access real-world data, and synchronize with the latest state of external servers, further enhancing the versatility of applications built on the network.\n\nCross-Chain Messaging and Gas Pricing Logic\n\nBoba Network has implemented cross-chain messaging, a community fraud detector, and a distinct gas pricing logic. Cross-chain messaging facilitates the independent verification of transactions by any interested party, enhancing the network\u2019s transparency and security. The community fraud detector adds an extra layer of security by allowing users to identify and report potentially fraudulent transactions within the network. Furthermore, Boba Network employs a unique gas pricing logic that updates the Layer-1 security fee price every 10 minutes, ensuring smoother transitions and minimizing abrupt price fluctuations.\n\nNFT Bridge\n\nBoba Network offers an NFT bridge, facilitating the seamless movement of NFT assets between Boba Network and Ethereum. This bridge plays a crucial role in enabling interoperability between the two networks, particularly for specialized NFT contracts designed for Layer-2 solutions.\n\nBoba Network\u2019s architecture leverages Optimistic rollup technology and a range of innovative features to enhance the efficiency, security, and functionality of the Ethereum ecosystem. From its use of sequencers and quick exit mechanisms to the Hybrid Compute functionality and NFT bridge, Boba Network is poised to play a significant role in addressing Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges while offering a versatile platform for decentralized applications.\n\nBOBA Token Economics\n\nBOBA serves as the backbone of Boba Network\u2019s governance and staking ecosystem, playing a pivotal role in shaping the network\u2019s future and facilitating user interactions. With a clear focus on enhancing network governance and utility, BOBA has been strategically distributed and integrated into the Boba Network ecosystem.\n\nBOBA\u2019s inception involved a carefully planned initial distribution strategy. Notably, an airdrop was conducted, offering a 1:1 ratio to OMG token holders as of the snapshot taken in November 2021. This airdrop allowed existing OMG token holders to seamlessly transition into the BOBA ecosystem, ensuring a fair and inclusive distribution.\n\nBOBA\u2019s primary function within the Boba Network is to serve as a governance token. Holders of BOBA tokens gain voting rights within the Boba Network DAO, enabling them to actively participate in shaping the network\u2019s direction. Decisions regarding community initiatives, network upgrades, and future developments rest in the hands of BOBA token holders, emphasizing the decentralized nature of the network.\n\nBeyond its governance role, BOBA holds utility in the day-to-day transactions within Boba Network. Users have the option to use BOBA as a means to pay for gas fees, providing them with added flexibility and a cost-effective advantage. Notably, choosing BOBA as the gas token results in a notable 25% fee discount, incentivizing its use and contributing to cost savings for network participants.\n\nThe BOBA token economics are intricately woven into the fabric of Boba Network, serving as both a governance instrument and a versatile utility token for users. Its initial distribution, governance role, and gas fee discounts collectively contribute to the vibrancy and functionality of the network, further solidifying BOBA\u2019s significance within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nBoba Network Ecosystem\n\nBoba Network has swiftly emerged as an enticing hub for blockchain protocols and projects, with an impressive lineup of 39 initiatives either in development or already launched. This ecosystem\u2019s growth is a testament to Boba Network\u2019s appeal as a Layer-2 scaling solution within the Ethereum landscape.\n\nNotably, OolongSwap, Boba Network\u2019s native decentralized exchange (DEX), stands at the forefront of this burgeoning ecosystem. OolongSwap has become a powerhouse, contributing to a substantial volume of $1.1 billion. This dominance underscores the popularity and utility of the platform among users, highlighting its pivotal role in the Boba Network ecosystem.\n\nTo further foster growth and engagement within the ecosystem, Boba Network has introduced the \u201cWAGMI\u201d incentive program. This unique initiative offers an alternative approach to traditional liquidity mining programs. It empowers projects deployed on Boba Network to incentivize users with \u201cWAGMI Options,\u201d often denoted as WAGMI tokens. These options are closely tied to key performance indicators (KPIs) that reflect the network\u2019s performance over a specified period.\n\nThe \u201cWAGMI\u201d program introduces a user-centric rewards system, allowing individuals to earn options by actively participating in the supported protocols based on predetermined KPIs. The value of these options is intricately linked to factors such as the network\u2019s TVL during a specific period. Users have the opportunity to redeem their accumulated WAGMI Options for BOBA tokens following a one-month settlement period.\n\nThe Boba Network ecosystem is thriving, driven by a diverse array of protocols and projects. OolongSwap\u2019s commanding presence and the innovative \u201cWAGMI\u201d incentive program stand as compelling examples of the network\u2019s vibrancy and commitment to nurturing a dynamic and rewarding environment for its users and contributors.\n\nCompetition\n\nBoba Network finds itself in a competitive landscape within Layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum. While it offers its own set of features and advantages, it faces competition from other prominent players in this domain.\n\nBoba Network contends with established Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, each characterized by its distinct attributes. Arbitrum, for instance, introduced a multi-round fraud proof mechanism, ensuring efficient transaction processing with reduced withdrawal times. In contrast, Boba Network prioritizes security and quick exits, allowing users to transfer funds back to Ethereum swiftly. Optimism, on the other hand, employs a single-round fraud proof approach, offering instantaneous fraud verification. However, this comes at the cost of increased transaction expenses due to the need for state roots.\n\nLooking ahead, Boba Network anticipates competition from emerging ZK (Zero-Knowledge) rollups once they achieve full functionality like Starknet and zkSync. These solutions are expected to significantly impact the Layer-2 landscape by leveraging zero-knowledge proof algorithms. This technology has the potential to drastically enhance transaction processing speed while reducing costs, making ZK rollups formidable contenders in the future.\n\nThe trajectory of Layer-2 networks, including Boba Network, is also influenced by external factors. Chief among these is the success and timing of Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake, known as The Merge. The Merge\u2019s outcome will play a pivotal role in shaping the roadmap of Layer-2 solutions, potentially impacting their adoption and development.\n\nBoba Network competes actively with existing Layer-2 solutions, Arbitrum and Optimism, while also keeping an eye on the evolving landscape, including potential rivals like ZK rollups. The interplay of technological innovation and external factors like The Merge will undoubtedly mold the competitive dynamics within the Layer-2 ecosystem in the coming years.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nThe world of Layer-2 scaling solutions is marked by rapid evolution and fierce competition. These solutions play a pivotal role in alleviating Ethereum\u2019s scalability concerns and enhancing its capabilities. As they continue to evolve, competition will be a driving force behind innovation, leading to the development of more efficient and feature-rich networks.\n\nNotably, the emergence of ZK rollups presents a potential shift in the dominance of Optimistic rollups like Boba Network. Once fully functional, ZK rollups are poised to offer higher transaction throughput and lower costs, potentially challenging the position of Optimistic rollups."

        "title": "ARK Invest is asking to issue a spot Ethereum ETF - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Yesterday, ARK Invest submitted an official request to the SEC to issue a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIf it is approved, it would be the first ETF ever to be collateralized directly in ETH and approved by the U.S. agency that oversees equity markets.\n\nETFs on Ethereum: Ark Invest gives it a try\n\nIn fact, ETFs on Ethereum already exist.\n\nHowever if, for example, in Europe and Canada there are also already some that are collateralized directly in ETH, in the U.S., on the other hand, only ETFs based on Ethereum price futures contracts have been approved.\n\nThe argument is the same as for Bitcoin: the SEC has agreed to approve ETFs based on futures contracts, which are themselves CFTC-approved derivatives, but has not yet agreed to approve ETFs based directly on cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe fact is that the markets are now firmly convinced that, after the ruling against the SEC in the Grayscale case, the agency no longer has the ability to refuse to approve similar applications.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that one of the applicants is the giant BlackRock, which has an approval rate of more than 99 percent for its requests to issue ETFs.\n\nSo given that it seems possible that within a few months at most the SEC will approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF for the U.S. market as well, ARK Invest has decided that now might be a good time to get a spot ETH ETF approved as well.\n\nCrypto ETFs\n\nETFs that replicate cryptocurrency price movements have a couple of advantages, although they also have disadvantages.\n\nThe first advantage is that they do not require the investor to custody the cryptocurrencies, since custody is the responsibility of the fund manager.\n\nNote that futures contract-based ETFs also do not require the custody of cryptocurrencies by the fund manager, who instead must only \u201ccustody\u201d futures contracts.\n\nBut ETFs collateralized directly in cryptocurrencies track their market value better, and in theory could even return the underlying to their owners.\n\nBut the main advantage is another: they are fully regulated instruments that trade on traditional exchanges.\n\nThat is, in other words, they are almost identical financial products to those already in use, except for the underlying, which makes them usable by anyone trading on traditional exchanges, even institutional clients.\n\nIn contrast, this reasoning does not apply to crypto instruments, which are therefore inaccessible to some potential institutional investors who are forced by law to use only fully regulated financial products.\n\nIn addition, having a presence on traditional exchanges means that crypto ETFs will also be available for use by those who have never entered and do not want to enter crypto markets.\n\nOf course, there are drawbacks as well, first and foremost the inability to self-custody and thus having to necessarily rely on a third party that in theory could also prove unreliable.\n\nThey also force their users to use the traditional financial system, and they cannot be traded P2P.\n\nARK Invest\n\nARK Investment Management is a well-known U.S. investment management company, and it manages several actively managed ETFs.\n\nIt was founded in 2014 by Cathie Wood, who is also its CEO and CFO.\n\nThe company is famous because its Innovation ETF in 2020 became the largest actively managed ETF in the world, with $17 billion in assets under management and a 170 percent return. The following year ARK Invest became one of the top 10 ETF issuers in the world.\n\nIt is therefore a veritable behemoth in this field, so it is no coincidence that it is the first to have a real chance of having a spot ETH ETF approved by the SEC for the U.S. market.\n\nARK Invest\u2019s Ethereum ETF\n\nThe spot ETH ETF that ARK Invest wants to issue will be called Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF, and it will be issued in partnership with 21Shares, a leading crypto ETF issuer.\n\n21Shares is a Swiss company, and operates mainly in Europe. It has already issued dozens of similar products, including ETFs and ETPs, including three ETPs on Ethereum.\n\nThe ETHs will be held by Coinbase Custody Trust Company."
