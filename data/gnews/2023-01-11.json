Eli Ben-Sasson, the co-founder and president of StarkWare, told CoinDesk that Account Abstraction could be used in the future to \u201cuse your facial recognition or biometrics to basically authorize [crypto] payments,\u201d sort of like how FaceID can activate credit card payments for iPhone users. \u201cThe infrastructure for doing this is now possible on Starknet,\u201d Ben-Sasson added."

        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 on-chain activity has been increasing to the extent that the leading two networks now process more transaction volume than mainnet Ethereum.\n\nLayer-2 networks Arbitrum and Optimism have seen an increase in transactions over the past three months. Comparatively, aside from a few spikes, transactions on the Ethereum network have declined by around 33% since late October, according to Etherscan.\n\nThis has enabled the two L2s combined to flip Ethereum for this metric, according to Dune Analytics data.\n\nThe chart shows Ethereum processed over 1.06 million transactions on Jan. 10, whereas Arbitrum and Optimism combined processed over 1.12 million transactions.\n\nAdditionally, Optimism has now surpassed Arbitrum in terms of daily transactions following a steady uptrend in activity since September.\n\nLayer-2 ecosystem analytics website L2beat reported all L2 activity in terms of transactions per second (TPS) surpassed that of Ethereum in October, and has remained above it since.\n\nL2 activity in TPS - l2beat.com\n\nOn Jan. 10, Ethereum processed an average of around 12 TPS, compared to the L2\u2019s average of nearly 16.5 TPS.\n\nArbitrum and Optimism combined represent almost 80% of the entire layer-2 ecosystem, according to L2beat.\n\nArbitrum One remains the market leader in terms of total value locked (TVL) with around $2.34 billion in collateral, giving it a 52.5% market share.\n\nOptimism is in second place with a TVL of $1.28 billion and a 28.6% market share.\n\nAccording to Nansen researcher Martin Lee, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are one of the key drivers of the adoption of the Optimism chain.\n\nRelated: Can the Optimism blockchain win the battle of the rollups?\n\nOther layer twos such as zk-rollup StarkNet have also been processing more transactions recently. StarkWare technology also powers other solutions including ImmutableX and dYdX.\n\nIn October, it was reported StarkNet was processing more transactions per week than the Bitcoin (BTC) network.\n\nAdditionally, Starkscan reports the network is at an all-time high in terms of TVL at $5.2 million."

        "content": "Bloomberg Intelligence senior macro strategist Mike McGlone says the top two crypto assets by market cap remind him of the early days of Netflix.\n\nIn a new interview with crypto influencer Scott Melker, McGlone says that promising new technologies historically find success over time.\n\nMcGlone predicts Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) will survive the turbulent market conditions and outperform commodities.\n\n\u201cThe key thing is that I like to point out is people are bullish commodities and like to look at cryptos. Commodities have a problem with the elasticity of supply and demand. You will always be able to create more for less unless you expect humans to be stupid. Commodities are stupid. But cryptos are the opposite. You look at the declining supply of Ethereum\u2026 The declining supply of Bitcoin\u2026 this adoption is still so fractional.\n\nI look at this 5,10 years from now like I remember Netflix when it first came out and I remember when the first day I walked into trading pits in Chicago and said there\u2019s a better way, and this is a better way.\u201d\n\nMcGlone says that the value of Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to rise in the future, but they will face resistance as long as the stock market declines. Crypto markets have generally mirrored the performance of the S&P 500 (SPX) in the current bear market.\n\n\u201cI fully expect Bitcoin and Ethereum are going to come out ahead, but they still have to be pressured if the stock market goes down.\n\nThe key thing is one of the best-performing assets I\u2019ve been shocked by and still stick with is Ethereum. Ethereum is up 10% this year. Yes, it might give some of that back. But it\u2019s holding that $1,000 support.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
