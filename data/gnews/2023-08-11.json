        "content": "To bridge the gap, Visa suggests leveraging Ethereum\u2019s ERC-4337, the current standard that enables smart contracts on the blockchain to serve as wallets via a process called \"account abstraction,\" and a paymaster contract \u2014 a smart-contract account that can sponsor gas fees on behalf of the user. The service would allow users to use a Visa card to pay directly for gas fees."

        "content": "Visa has wrapped up testing a way for users to pay on-chain gas fees directly in fiat with a credit or debit card, the payments giant said on Thursday.\n\nThe experiment, which was conducted on the Ethereum Goerli testnet, uses a paymaster contract to sponsor gas fees on behalf of users, according to a statement.\n\nIt means users can send blockchain transactions without having to worry about maintaining a balance of ether. Visa believes the contract could make transactions more accessible to a wider range of users.\n\n\u201cOur experiment aims to offer a promising approach to substantially addressing the challenges of blockchain-based transactions,\u201d Visa\u2019s technical team wrote. \u201cBy leveraging the innovative concept of a paymaster, in conjunction with account abstraction and the ERC-4337 standard, we explored the potential for a process that could redefine blockchain-based transactions.\u201d\n\nA paymaster contract is a specialized type of smart contract within the blockchain ecosystem, designed to manage the payment of gas fees.\n\nThe company said merchants or decentralized applications (dapps) could run their own paymaster solution, or existing wallet and paymaster service providers could offer a card-based gas fee payment choice alongside their other paymaster offerings.\n\nThe experiment is part of Visa\u2019s ongoing development within the industry. The company has been working on ways to make blockchain payments more user-friendly and accessible.\n\nVisa reportedly began experimenting with converting digital assets into fiat payments on the Ethereum blockchain earlier this year. The aim is to parallel its current foreign currency exchange processes, as part of its broader push to build proficiency in global settlements involving both digital and traditional currencies.\n\nIn the context of transactions on blockchains like Ethereum, every operation conducted incurs a cost known as a \u201cgas\u201d fee, representing the computational effort required to execute the operation. Gas fees help keep the Ethereum network secure by making it costly for bad actors to spam the network.\n\nSince inception, network fees have been a fundamental part of ensuring security and encouraging adoption within first-generation blockchain systems. Though, following ten years of user growth, the hope is the trajectory of Web3 will move towards a \u201cgasless\u201d future.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "The next big leap for Ethereum liquid staking: The staking landscape - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Imagine a world where everyone, regardless of their background, can easily access and participate in the revolutionary world of Ethereum. A world where decentralized applications empower individuals, and the potential for innovation knows no bounds. Against a highly equivocal and chaotic macroeconomic landscape, this is the world that the prophets of Ethereum dream of.\n\nBut little do they know this world is like an unrealized dream. Why? Let\u2019s dig deeper.\n\nReflecting on the Ethereum liquid staking landscape\n\nCentralized liquid staking protocols are at the forefront of the liquid staking revolution on Ethereum, and it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Why? Because they are highly scalable \u2014 thanks to the centralized validator set that they have. The biggest liquid staking protocol on Ethereum currently has a limited node operator set of 29 operators. It must then be a no-brainer that they hold a hegemony over the network. Any protocol claiming to be decentralized but running its operations as a business is also able to offer much higher standards of composability. While this composability that is offered to users is a feature, it can be counter-productive as well \u2014 primarily because of the systemic risks this can cause.\n\nOn the flip side, decentralized protocols do exist, but they are highly unscalable. And thus, they have a fraction of ETH staked in them compared to what is often staked via the centralized ones.\n\nWhile decentralized protocols have attempted to reduce the minimum capital required to run a validator node from 32 to 8 ETH, that is still a sizeable amount for the wider ecosystem. Admittedly, this does open up opportunities for a wide number of stakers to start staking on the network, however, we contend that 8 ETH is still a sizeable amount. This reintroduces the problem of scalability, and thus a significant portion of ETH gets staked through a select group of professional node operators. This leads to the further concentration of staked ETH. The presence of these centralized node operators across different liquid staking protocols undermines the censorship resistance of the underlying network.\n\nThe inflow of ETH post-Shapella is a good indicator of users\u2019 liquid staking preferences. One would hope that a lot of the incoming ETH would go to decentralized liquid staking; however, the figures state otherwise.\n\nMaking Ethereum liquid staking scalable\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for the existing liquid staking protocols today is that they are tuned for either scalability alone or decentralization alone. The ones that are tuned for scalability alone are not decentralized, and the ones that are tuned for decentralization are not scalable. There are several examples of this \u2014 from protocols having a concentrated node operator set to those having high minimum capital requirements to run validator nodes for Ethereum.\n\nWhile there have been attempts by these protocols to move towards either making their architectures scalable or decentralized, making that is quite difficult given the huge amounts of ETH that are already staked via them. Moreover, these protocol-level changes require a lot of internal deliberations (at-least for decentralized protocols) before they are rolled out.\n\nMoreover, a core objective of any business is to make sure that they hold the hegemony over the industry to persistently retain that. This is reflected by the feigned attempts at a willingness to decentralize \u2014 but then having them falling on their head. Perhaps, there is no reason why this would happen. A centralized liquid staking protocol often operates as a business whose core objective is to compromise decentralization to achieve profitability. While I do not condemn the latter, I do feel that it comes \u2014 almost always \u2014 at the cost of decentralization.\n\nWhat Ethereum needs\n\nEthereum prophets often call for the need to diversify staking across a multitude of protocols. And perhaps, it wouldn\u2019t be remiss to credit those protocols that have emerged that are attempting to realize that vision. However, I must provide a caveat that any emerging protocols need strategic and critical analysis. No one would want shabby architecture being polished and presented as a resilient solution and risking the stability of Ethereum. I believe that there are two things that need immediate attention to drive growth to Ethereum liquid staking:\n\nReducing the minimum capital requirements to run a validator node: This is perhaps easier stated than executed. Reducing the minimum capital requirements incentivizes a wider spectrum of users to participate in network validation.\n\nThis is perhaps easier stated than executed. Reducing the minimum capital requirements incentivizes a wider spectrum of users to participate in network validation. Building censorship resistance: This is perhaps common knowledge, but it often gets overlooked. With the pace at which the macroeconomic landscape is evolving, it is a dire need for protocols to integrate solutions that build the censorship resilience of the protocol. This is akin to hedging against potential future slowdowns in validator architecture and building a high-performant architecture that keeps the network secure.\n\nAdmittedly, I find myself at crossroads while writing these solutions because, while I assert that being aware of the existing challenges as well as the solutions is of paramount importance, it is not enough to persistently echo them. It is essential that we engage in extensive research and relentlessly test and build solutions that help solve these challenges and build a resilient architecture.\n\nMohak is the founder of ClayStack.
