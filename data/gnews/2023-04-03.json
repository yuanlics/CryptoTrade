The attacker, who had recently become a validator, included additional transactions in the block they proposed, allowing them to front-run the MEV bot. The sandwich attack involved pushing $25 million worth of tokens across three main addresses. The incident was identified by a pseudonymous Twitter user and has prompted Flashbot developers to roll out a patch to address the vulnerability."

        "summary": "  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposes integrating zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zk-EVMs) on the base layer to speed up verification without compromising decentralization and security. This would involve treating the layer 1 as a \"clearinghouse\" by pushing most activity to layer 2, but zk-EVMs would need to be \"open\" with different clients having their own implementations and waiting for compatible proofs before accepting a block. Buterin believes this approach would decentralize Ethereum at the base layer, make running a full node easier, and reduce transaction costs and increased throughput of smart contract deployments. Other companies like Polygon, StarkWare, ConsenSys, Scroll, zkSync, and Immutable are also deploying similar zkEVM scaling solutions."

He thinks that ZK-EVMs will become a third type of Ethereum client, just as important as execution and consensus clients. Buterin aims to balance the advantages of the multi-client philosophy with the use of ZK-EVMs to increase scalability, security, and decentralization. He suggested that users could use different types of ZK-EVMs, such as single, closed, or open multi ZK-EVMs, to verify layer 1. However, he noted that there are technical challenges related to latency and data efficiency in deploying ZK technology with multiple clients. Buterin also believes that clients will start experimenting with ZK-EVMs to prove Ethereum block execution on their own, especially with the development of stateless clients."

Polygon zkEVM has $2.42 million in TVL, a 15,750% increase in the last week. Network downtime is expected as zkSync Era is still in alpha, but it's encouraging to see increased activity as users experience low gas fees on the network."

The bots were trying to perform \"sandwich trades\" by spotting when traders were trying to purchase tokens and getting in between the trade for a profit. However, the rogue validator replaced the reverse transactions, leading to the losses. This is one of the largest exploits on MEV bots recorded since September 2022, according to CertiK. The security firm highlighted that this could affect other MEV searchers conducting non-atomical strategies like sandwich trading. MEV bots have the potential to earn vast amounts of digital assets, but they are also prone to hacks and exploits."

An alternative is to store a document's hash on-chain while keeping the file elsewhere, saving space and ensuring integrity. Decentralized storage networks like Arweave and Filecoin offer a cost-effective and secure solution by distributing data across multiple nodes. Best practices for decentralized file storage include storing metadata on the blockchain, using a decentralized storage network, ensuring data redundancy, and protecting privacy and security. By following these practices, users can ensure their data is stored reliably and securely."
