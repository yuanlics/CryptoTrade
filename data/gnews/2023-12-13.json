        "content": "SEC Extends Deadline on Invesco and Galaxy Digital Spot Ethereum ETF to February 2024\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced a delay in its decision regarding the spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposed by Invesco and Galaxy Digital.\n\nIn a notice issued on December 13, the SEC stated that it would extend the period for consideration of a proposed rule change. This change would enable the Cboe BZX Exchange to list and trade shares of the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF.\n\nAs per the notice, the 45-day period following the publication of the proposed rule change ends on December 23, 2023. The SEC has designated February 6, 2024, as the deadline for either approving or disapproving the rule change, or initiating proceedings to determine disapproval.\n\nThis comes as the SEC recently announced it will delay its decision on Grayscale's proposed Ethereum spot ETF, stating that it will need more time to assess a proposed rule change that would allow NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.\n\nNotably, other firms such as BlackRock, Hashdex, ARK 21Shares, VanEck, and Fidelity have also applied for spot crypto ETFs. Recently, representatives from these asset managers have held meetings with SEC officials to discuss their ETF offerings. This has raised speculation that an approval from the SEC is imminent, and that multiple spot ETF applications would be passed simultaneously.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

This upgrade is set to take place during the first half of 2024 and is expected to significantly enhance Ethereum's network activity.\n\nProtodanksharding represents an initial step towards the implementation of Danksharding, a more efficient form of sharding for Ethereum. Unlike the original sharding technique, Danksharding simplifies the process by introducing data blobs, temporary data packets attached to blocks. These data blobs have greater data capacity than blocks, but they are not permanently stored or accessed by the Ethereum virtual machine.\n\nThe JPMorgan analysts emphasized that the upgrade would particularly benefit Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP). It would provide additional temporary data space, improving network throughput and reducing transaction fees for Layer 2 networks on Ethereum. Essentially, data blobs enhance the efficiency of Layer 2 networks without altering the Ethereum block size.\n\nJPMorgan analysts also indicated that factors expected to be bullish for Bitcoin in 2024, such as the possible approval of spot ETFs and the upcoming halving, are already factored into its price. They noted that the ratio of Bitcoin's market price to production cost decreased after the 2020 halving and stated that a similar response could be expected after the 2024 halving.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."
