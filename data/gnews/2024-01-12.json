Ethereum's traditional sequential execution model simplifies hardware requirements, but it creates limitations in handling increasing volume of transactions. Parallel processing can address these challenges, allowing many transactions to be processed at the same time, instead of sequentially. However, other approaches such as sharding can also help scale blockchains. Popular parallel EVM protocols include Sei, Monad, and Neon. Sei's EVM is built into the chain, while Monad is creating a custom EVM implementation. Both use optimistic parallel execution, but Monad is also working on a custom state database to improve state access and storage. Despite these advancements, parallelism only cuts a small fraction of costs, and infrastructure around the database will need to change to decrease transaction processing times and gas prices."

Staking in Ethereum involves validators locking up their ETH tokens to secure the network, and validators play a crucial role in confirming transactions and creating new blocks. To become a validator, one needs to deposit a minimum of 32 ETH into the deposit contract and run a validator client. The process of staking Ethereum is influenced by the amount of ETH staked, the behavior of validators, and market volatility. Staking ETH allows validators to earn passive income and participate in network governance decisions. The best Ethereum staking platforms are Coinbase, Rocketpool, Lido, and Binance, offering APYs ranging from 3.25% to 3.8%.
