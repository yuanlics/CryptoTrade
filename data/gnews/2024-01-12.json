        "title": "Ethereum Price Predictions for 2024: Comprehensive Insights with MEXC Research - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "MEXC\n\nSingapore , Jan. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement, especially after the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. This development has significantly sparked interest in Ethereum-based tokens, leading to a notable surge in their value. Ethereum's price, in particular, has reached its highest point since May 2022. Investors are optimistic about the possibility of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF receiving SEC approval, contributing to this upward trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding to enthusiasm, Vitalik Buterin's recent proposal to increase Ethereum's gas limit further fueled the surge, with Ethereum's price surpassing the $2,600 mark for the first time since May 2022. This has set a promising stage for Ethereum price climbing towards the $3,000 milestone.\n\nTechnical analysis using Bollinger Bands on the daily timeframe supports this bullish perspective. Ethereum is currently trading at $2,655, having moved above the upper Bollinger Band at $2,539, indicating a shift to bullish market momentum.\n\nTo reinforce the prediction of Ethereum reaching $3,000, a significant challenge must be overcome: breaking through the psychological resistance around $2,800. Successfully navigating past this point could pave the way for Ethereum to hit the anticipated $3,000 mark.\n\nMEXC Research's collection of market insights reveals substantial growth in Ethereum markets, driven by strong buying interest. This trend suggests a possible broader upward trajectory in the cryptocurrency market, with Ethereum poised to benefit significantly from this momentum.\n\nRenowned experts have weighed in with their predictions for Ethereum's price in 2024:\n\n\u2022 Anthony Sano's Optimistic Forecast: Predicting Ethereum to reach an impressive $10,000 by 2024, Sano emphasizes Ethereum's unique staking feature and the likelihood of an Ethereum ETF introduction, which he believes will attract institutional investors.\n\n\u2022 Rekt Capital's Analysis: Suggesting a 22% increase, Rekt Capital believes Ethereum could surpass $2,600 if it maintains firm support at $2,274.\n\n\u2022 FieryTrading's Bullish Trend Prediction: Ethereum has maintained a bullish trend for over 1.5 years, according to FieryTrading, with the potential to reach $5,000 by late 2024 or early 2025.\n\n\u2022 Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou's Long-term View: The JPMorgan Managing Director highlights Ethereum's potential, especially with the \"Protodanksharding\" upgrade, projecting a price towards $8,000 by 2026 and possible outperformance over Bitcoin in 2024.\n\n\u2022 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe's Forecast: Anticipating a correction to around $1,900, followed by a rise to $3,400-$3,800 in early 2024.\n\n\u2022 Credible Crypto's Ambitious Predictions: Predicting ETH could reach a minimum of $10,000 and possibly soar to $20,000 in 2024, representing a substantial increase from its current value.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupporting these optimistic forecasts, data from Santiment Information indicates a significant increase in Ethereum accumulation by top holders. The top 150 self-custody wallets now hold a record-breaking 56.25 million ETH, demonstrating considerable confidence in Ethereum's future.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum's price predictions for 2024, as compiled by MEXC Research, range from a conservative estimate of $6,000 to a striking $10,000, heavily influenced by market sentiment and the anticipated introduction of an Ethereum ETF.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "Geoffrey Kendrick of Standard Chartered Bank predicts the SEC\u2019s approval of U.S. Ethereum ETFs by May 23.\n\nStarting with initial rejections before granting approval, Standard Chartered foresees parallels for the Ethereum ETF with the SEC\u2019s approach to Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nGeoffrey Kendrick, who leads the bank\u2019s forex and digital assets research, believes Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. will get the green light in late May. Kendrick compares this situation to what happened with Bitcoin ETFs and thinks Ethereum\u2019s price (ETH) may reach $4,000 by that date due to hype.\n\nKendrick\u2019s confidence comes from the fact that the SEC hasn\u2019t treated Ether as a security in its legal actions. Ether is already being traded as a future on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\n\u201cGrayscale, which has an Ethereum trust, wants to convert it into an ETF. If they get denied, they will likely appeal,\u201d he said, adding that there\u2019s no reason for the SEC to treat Ethereum differently.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin highlights opportunities and risks in merging crypto, AI\n\nKendrick is generally optimistic about cryptocurrencies and their price valuations. Kendrick predicted that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the end of this year and $200,000 by 2025. He believes these targets are possible, especially with funds expected to continually flow into Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nKendrick on CNN talking about Bitcoin ETFs\n\nFollowing Bitcoin ETF approval, Bitcoin\u2019s price fell slightly due to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust outflows, but Bitcoin\u2019s price has since rebounded and now sits around $43,540. Kendrick believes Ethereum will not face the same sort of post-approval drop in price due to the Grayscale Ethereum Trust not being as large of a part of the Ethereum market as Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust was for Bitcoin.\n\nKendrick expects that on May 23, the SEC will approve basic Ethereum ETFs that follow the price of Ethereum. He adds that ETFs that include extra earnings from staking might come later and already exist in Europe.\n\nKendrick also talks about Ethereum\u2019s upcoming upgrades, saying it should make Ethereum more competitive and keep rewards from staking high for longer and that this, in turn, will benefit Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "JPMorgan isn't betting big that the Securities and Exchange Commission will clear spot Ethereum ETH +1.32% exchange-traded funds in May \u2014 its first deadline to approve such funds.\n\n\"In our opinion, for the SEC to approve spot Ethereum ETFs in May, it would need to classify Ethereum as a commodity (similar to bitcoin) rather than a security,\" JPMorgan's Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou told The Block. \"This is far from given, and I wouldn't put more than a 50% chance to the SEC classifying Ethereum as a commodity before May.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs after over a decade of rejections. Traders are now betting that spot Ethereum ETFs could be next in line to get the green light as the price of ether has surged nearly 20% in the last seven days compared to bitcoin's gain of 2.5% during the same period.\n\nBut, according to Panigirtzoglou, the SEC is \"still signaling that it continues to view all other cryptocurrencies outside bitcoin as securities.\"\n\nLast year, JPMorgan said U.S. lawmakers could potentially put ether into a new \u201cother category\u201d to avoid classifying it as a security.\n\nStaking protocols\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nLast year, SEC Chair Gary Gensler reiterated that tokens using staking protocols, such as Ethereum's ETH token, could be considered securities under U.S. law. During a nearly five-hour hearing with lawmakers last year, Gensler refused to say whether ETH was a security. And earlier this week, while approving spot bitcoin ETFs, Gensler said that decision \"should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\"\n\nSome analysts, including Bloomberg Intelligence's James Seyffart, have been more optimistic than JPMorgan that spot ETH ETFs will get approved.\n\nThe SEC had to finally approve spot bitcoin ETFs in part because it had already approved bitcoin futures ETFs, and a federal court ruled that the SEC must review its rejection of Grayscale's attempt to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nSeveral firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have recently filed for spot ETH ETFs."

        "content": "Ether price gained 13.5% between Jan. 10 and Jan. 12, breaking above $2,650 for the first time since May 2022. The pivotal factor for the rally has been the spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund approval, although the leading cryptocurrency traded down 2% in the same period. Investors are now questioning if Ether (ETH) has what it takes to sustain its current $322 billion market capitalization.\n\nEther/USD vs. BTC/USD, SOL/USD, and BNB/USD. Source: TradingView\n\nIn the past 60 days, Ether price has gained 27%, outpacing Bitcoin\u2019s 24% positive move in the same period \u2014 quite a feat considering that the spot BTC approval was expected to catapult its price as it opens room for a whole new set of clients who could not acquire cryptocurrency directly. Furthermore, Bloomberg ETF analysts hold 70% odds of an Ethereum ETF approval by May, as opposed to their 95% chances for Bitcoin.\n\nBlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck and other asset managers expect the final U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission deadline on the spot Ethereum ETF decision by May 23, but given that Bitcoin already paved the way, some analysts believe the final answer might come sooner than anticipated. For instance, the SEC has intermediary deadlines in late January for some of the applicants.\n\nEthereum competitors have lost momentum\n\nGiven that Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETF approval had a dismal price impact, one should conclude that Ether\u2019s bullish momentum has been driven by other factors. For starters, Ethereum\u2019s direct competitors faced a correction after expressive rallies. BNB (BNB) declined 2% in the seven days leading up to Jan. 12, while SOL (SOL) dropped 3% in the same period.\n\nIn SOL\u2019s case, the bullish momentum faded after the extremely successful SPL token airdrops \u2014 including JITO, BONK and WIF \u2014 faced 40% and higher price corrections. Moreover, much of the decentralized applications (DApps) activity gain seemed to be concentrated on a handful of projects that had imminent token launches, which also faded after the respective snapshots. Consequently, investors\u2019 appetite for Solana\u2019s SOL token started to diminish.\n\nBNB faced impressive and unexpected 35.7% gains between Dec. 17 and 27, 2023, but the bullish momentum was not accompanied by network activity. In fact, in the seven days ending Jan. 12, BNB Chain\u2019s active DApp addresses declined by 61%, while the number of transactions plunged by 64%, according to DappRadar. As a comparison, Ethereum faced a 2.2% decline in active addresses and 0.3% fewer volumes in the same period.\n\nBlockchains ranked by 7-day DApps activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nRegardless of how the nonfungible token (NFT) markets are depressed relative to the 2021 peak, Ethereum\u2019s network remains the undisputed leader in value, including the leading collections \u2014 CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Pudgy Penguins and Azuki. In essence, those using Ethereum decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and top NFT assets are not worried about a $6.30 average transaction fee.\n\nEthereum staking and DApp activity remain resilient\n\nEther\u2019s price has also benefited from its 4.3% annualized staking reward and a slightly negative issuance rate. Almost 24% of the entire circulating ETH supply is locked up while participating in the network\u2019s validating process, which fuels investors\u2019 expectations toward its price. In comparison, Solana\u2019s adjusted staking reward is 0.8% due to its high SOL issuance rate.\n\nRelated: Spot Bitcoin ETF approved in the US\u2013What to expect next\n\nThe Ethereum network is expected to undergo a hard fork that would mark a significant advancement in its technological capabilities. Focused on increased data availability and reduced costs for rollup transactions, the \u201cDencun\u201d fork has its first testnet implementation scheduled for Jan. 17. Another anticipated improvement is account abstraction, which enables reduced transaction costs and secure social logins.\n\nEthereum\u2019s limited capacity to scale and implement privacy solutions in the base layer has been a constant source of criticism; thus, it makes sense to smooth the process of accessing its second layers in terms of user experience and costs. Therefore, Ether\u2019s rally above $2,600 has less relationship to the spot ETF approval than it meets the eye, as the network remains dominant in the smart contract industry.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Down? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "To say Ethereum (ETH 1.14%) is down would be exactly correct. However, when considering the gains made among its peers during 2023, its 90% increase makes it feel like Ethereum more or less watched from the sidelines while other cryptocurrencies had triple-digit percentage gains.\n\nGiven its position as the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency on the market, it seems unnatural for Ethereum not to have had a more considerable jump. But all this means is that Ethereum has some catching up to do in 2024. Here's why Ethereum remains an attractive buy.\n\nThe smart contract pioneer\n\nEthereum's launch in 2015 altered the trajectory of crypto forever. Its novel smart contract functionality provided the foundation for developers to create innovative applications of blockchain technology that have now become common. Without Ethereum, things like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stablecoins, and much more would not exist.\n\nAlthough newer cryptocurrencies like Solana and Avalanche provide similar or even superior capabilities today, Ethereum remains the clear-cut leader of decentralized innovation. Several metrics demonstrate Ethereum's dominance over hopeful competitors, but two in particular highlight just how tight the original smart contract blockchain's grip on the market remains.\n\nThe undisputed champion of the decentralized economy\n\nFirst is total value locked (TVL). Quantifying the total value of assets currently staked or locked in a particular blockchain, TVL is a metric used to compare the amount of liquidity within varying DeFi ecosystems. The thinking goes that the greater the TVL, the more robust and valuable a blockchain is. As a disclaimer, this statistic has some limitations, but it does a good enough job of leveling the playing field to make comparisons.\n\nToday Ethereum's TVL is worth roughly $31 billion and accounts for 55% of the TVL across all blockchains with DeFi capabilities. Solana has just $1.3 billion in TVL, and Avalanche has $856 million.\n\nThe distance separating Ethereum from competitors undoubtedly results from its first-mover's advantage. As the first smart contract-capable blockchain, it was the only option for quite a while. Yet even as competing blockchains have joined the DeFi race and attracted significant hype, none has been able to challenge Ethereum where it matters most.\n\nFollow the developers\n\nGoing beyond TVL, assessing the number of active developers provides valuable insights into a cryptocurrency's potential. Developers are key players, responsible for creating applications, fixing issues, and introducing new features -- all critical for the sustained success of a blockchain.\n\nYet again, Ethereum shines. As of the latest count in October 2023, Ethereum had twice as many active developers as Polkadot, and nearly three times more than Solana.\n\nEthereum's extensive developer community is arguably its most valuable asset, giving it a significant competitive advantage over other blockchains. With developers involved in day-to-day maintenance, further upgrades, and exploring new use cases, Ethereum is typically the top choice for new projects seeking a reliable blockchain.\n\nMost importantly, a robust developer community not only ensures long-term viability, but also attracts more projects. Since the value of most cryptocurrencies is tied to their utility, a blockchain supporting numerous use cases often commands a higher price.\n\nEthereum's value proposition today\n\nConsidering its lackluster performance in 2023, Ethereum simply holds too many advantages compared to other blockchains not to be a leader in the crypto market this year. With an expansive and flourishing ecosystem of tokens, decentralized exchanges, NFTs, stablecoins, and much more, Ethereum provides investors with unparalleled exposure to the burgeoning landscape of decentralized finance.\n\nAs it currently stands, Ethereum remains almost 50% off its all-time high of nearly $4,900. Considering its position as a DeFi leader and the likelihood of a looming crypto bull market, Ethereum holds plenty of upside for the upcoming year. While the rest of the crypto market focuses on newer or more glamorous blockchains, don't forget about Ethereum. It still has plenty of room to run.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Ethereum's Buterin Gas Limit Hike Riles up Developers and Can Impact You With Slower Speeds - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin has proposed a significant increase in the gas limit, to improve the network\u2019s throughput.\n\nETH developers are navigating a balance between enhancing transaction capacity and controlling the state\u2019s growth.\n\nThey are working on various solutions to address these challenges, including EIP-4444 and EIP-4844.\n\nEthereum developers are currently grappling with a contentious proposal from the network\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, to increase the gas limit by 33%.\n\nThis suggestion has raised concerns due to the potential impact on the growing size of the blockchain state.\n\nEthereum Proposals Gas Limit Increase to Boost Throughput\n\nEthereum, the second-largest blockchain, finds itself at a pivotal juncture with this proposal. On January 11, Buterin proposed boosting the gas limit from its current level of 30 million to 40 million. This is intended to improve the network\u2019s throughput, allowing for more transactions per block and thus expanding the network\u2019s overall capacity.\n\nButerin said : \u201cHonestly, I think doing a modest gas limit increase even today is reasonable.\u201d\n\nThe concept of a gas limit in Ethereum has been a dynamic feature since the platform\u2019s launch in 2015. Originally set at approximately three million, the limit has been periodically adjusted upwards to accommodate the network\u2019s increasing usage and the broader adoption of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposes a 33% increase in the gas limit, aiming to enhance the network's transaction capacity. This move could impact transaction fees and overall efficiency. Keeping an eye on Ethereum's ongoing developments. \u26d3\ufe0f\ud83d\udca1 #Ethereum #Blockchain \u2014 Nestor Makhno \ud83c\udfad (@NestorMakhno3_0) January 11, 2024\n\nHowever, this latest proposal is a significant leap and is sparking debate among developers over its potential implications.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain state, which is vital for storing account balances and smart contract data, currently requires about 267 gigabytes (GB) of storage space. The entire history of the blockchain is even more substantial, amounting to around 900GB, as per data from Blockchair .\n\nConcerns over Gas Limit Increase, Highlighting Challenges of Scaling\n\nNonetheless, Buterin\u2019s proposal to increase the limit has encountered some resistance. This is primarily due to concerns about its impact on the size of the blockchain\u2019s state.\n\nEthereum developer Marius van der Wijden articulated these apprehensions in a January 11 blog post. In his post , van der Wijden noted that, while storage space might be relatively affordable, an expanded state size could potentially slow down accessing and modifying data on the blockchain.\n\nI wrote down some of my thoughts on raising the gas limit today: https://t.co/gX0eihUyYa (Haven't proof-read it, so if you find a mistake, you can keep it) \u2014 MariusVanDerWijden (@vdWijden) January 11, 2024\n\nVan der Wijden underscored the necessity for clear and effective solutions to manage the state\u2019s growth.\n\nThe proposed increase brings with it several technical challenges. These include extended time for synchronizing the blockchain and complexities in developing and maintaining diverse clients.\n\nP\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi, a team lead for Ethereum, echoed concerns that a higher gas limit might demand more bandwidth. He pointed out the significant trade-offs associated with a higher gas limit. While it could indeed boost the network\u2019s transaction capacity, it also risks accelerating the growth of the state size.\n\nThis could lead to slower synchronization times and heighten the risks of network attacks and spam, presenting a complex balancing act for the Ethereum community. These concerns reflect the ongoing challenges faced in scaling blockchain networks while ensuring their security and efficiency.\n\nWhat problem does increasing the gas limit solve? Increasing it definitely has a downside. State will grow faster, sync time will get slower quicker, DoS potential will grow. Would be nice to have a number on those. That said, what does increasing the gas limit net us? \u2014 P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi (karalabe.eth) (@peter_szilagyi) January 11, 2024\n\nDevs Seek Scalability Solutions Amid Gas Limit Debate\n\nThe gas limit on Ethereum acts as a threshold for the amount of computational work \u2013 denoted as gas \u2013 that can be included in each block, encompassing transactions and smart contract executions. This limit is vital for maintaining manageable block sizes, which is essential for the network\u2019s optimal performance.\n\nI am for increasing the gas limit, but we need to be more careful. I think after 4844, the best way to do this would actually be:\n\n\u2013 Increase the execution capacity by increasing the gas limit BUT ALSO increasing CALLDATA cost (ETH L1 is for execution, not data)\n\n\u2013 Increase the\u2026 https://t.co/kOblgRCHQV \u2014 Dankrad Feist (@dankrad) January 11, 2024\n\nValidators, who are responsible for creating new blocks, have the discretion to tweak the gas limit, albeit within specified bounds. This flexibility allows for some adaptability in the network\u2019s capacity.\n\nIncreasing the gas limit is seen as a potential way to enhance Ethereum\u2019s throughput and capacity. However, this approach comes with its own set of challenges, including heightened stress on network hardware and possible security vulnerabilities.\n\nI'm strongly in support of increasing @ethereum gas limit to 40-45m \u2013 we have the network headroom and will be beneficial for all parties https://t.co/GQb8SbavAY \u2014 Jesse Pollak (jesse.xyz) \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@jessepollak) January 10, 2024\n\nTo address these and other long-term growth issues, Ethereum developers are working on various solutions . Notable among these are Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) like EIP-4444 , which proposes mechanisms for expiring chain history, and EIP-4844, which focuses on enhancing rollup data availability through the use of \u201cblobs.\u201d These proposed upgrades are part of the ongoing efforts to ensure Ethereum\u2019s scalability and efficiency while managing the network\u2019s expanding needs."

        "title": "What Is Gwei in Ethereum? - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Gwei plays an essential role in transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nA concept you will encounter in your interaction with Ethereum is Gwei. This term is the key to understanding transaction costs, network congestion, and the general operations of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThis article delves into the world of Gwei, explaining what it is and how you can determine it.\n\nWhat Is the ETH Gwei?\n\nGwei is a denomination for gas costs on the Ethereum network. The name is short for gigaWei, which is derived from blending two terms, giga and Wei.\n\nThe latter is the smallest fraction of Ether (ETH), the blockchain network\u2019s native cryptocurrency. Giga, on the other hand, denotes a billion, so Gwei comprises a billion Wei.\n\nSimilarly, one Gwei amounts to a billionth of Ether (0.000000001 ETH). So, a transaction costing 50 Gwei will set you back 0.000000050 ETH. Although there are other smaller ETH denominations, it is the most popular and appropriate means of paying gas fees on Ethereum.\n\nBefore delving into how Gwei works, it is essential to explain gas.\n\nGas refers to fees that users incur to verify their transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The fees are central to the network\u2019s functioning as they incentivize verifiers (nodes that validate transactions) and entrench decentralization.\n\nHow Does Gwei Work?\n\nAs the defacto payment medium, Gwei is crucial to the Ethereum gas system, determining the fees for executing different transactions on the network.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief overview of its components and their functioning:\n\nGas: The compensation validators pay to approve their transactions on the blockchain. Every operation has its set gas units.\n\nGas Price: The fee in ETH expressed in Gwei that a user sets for their transaction. Higher prices fast-track the validation of transactions.\n\nGas Limit: The maximum gas a user is willing to pay for the transaction. The transaction fails if the gas required exceeds this ceiling.\n\nDynamic Gas : The gas prices vary depending on the network conditions.\n\nPriority fees : Users may sometimes pay additional fees to incentivize validators to prioritize their transactions\n\nDetermining Gwei on the Ethereum Network\n\nMultiply the gas limit by the price to calculate the transaction fee. We can express this statement mathematically as follows:\n\nTransaction Fee (ETH) = Gas Limit * Gas Price (Gwei) / 1,000,000,000\n\nFor instance, if your transaction\u2019s gas limit is 21,000, and the price is 50 Gwei, the total fee would be 1,050,000 Gwei or 0.00105 ETH.\n\nSeveral factors can affect the amount of Gwei users pay. These include:\n\nNetwork State: Gas prices rise during periods of network congestion as users compete for limited resources. Consequently, transactions at those times are expensive. The reverse is true for non-peak hours.\n\nNature of the transaction: Complex transactions, like using a smart contract or decentralized application (dApp), incur more Gwei and vice versa.\n\nBase Fee: This is the minimum price validators will accept to process a transaction.\n\nPriority Fee: As stated, this is an optional fee. Paying it increases your expenditure and motivates the verifiers to prioritize your transaction.\n\nExplaining Other Ether Denominations\n\nWhile Gwei dominates transaction fees, understanding the wider Ether denomination landscape can be immensely beneficial. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of the key players:\n\nWei: This is ETH\u2019s smallest unit. While rarely used directly for fees, it provides granular precision for calculations. It draws its name from Wei Dai, an outlier in cryptography famed for developing b-money, which included the creation of Bitcoin .\n\nKwei: This is the second smallest measure of Ethereum. It is worth a thousand wei and is also known as Babbage, after Charles Babbage, a pioneer in computer automation.\n\nMwei: This unit is also nicknamed Lovelace after Ada Lovelace, who laid the foundation for using algorithms. It comprises a million wei and is one step lower than Gwei.\n\nTwei: Also named Szabo after Nick Szabo, a trailblazer in cryptography and digital assets, this unit is worth a thousand Gwei. It offers a convenient scale for fees associated with significant transfers or complex smart contract interactions.\n\nPwei: Ethereum enthusiasts also refer to this denomination as the Finney. It derives its name from Hal Finney, one of Bitcoin\u2019s founding fathers, and contains a million Gwei. It is handy in substantial transactions, like purchasing a plot of virtual land or funding a large-scale decentralized application (dApp).\n\nEther: It is the native crypto powering Ethereum. It is nicknamed Buterin, after Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s founder.\n\nUnderstanding these denominations empowers users to make informed decisions when interacting with the Ethereum network.\n\nWhy Is Gwei Crucial to Ethereum Transactions?\n\nGwei\u2019s significance goes beyond just fueling transactions. It\u2019s the cornerstone of a dynamic and efficient ecosystem with several key benefits:\n\nPrecise Fee Calculations: Gwei\u2019s granular nature allows for accurate fee estimations, eliminating rounding errors and ensuring users pay exactly what their transactions demand. This precision is essential for small transactions and micropayments, which would otherwise be impractical with larger denominations.\n\nEfficient Resource Allocation: The dynamic Gwei price system acts as a market mechanism, incentivizing validators to prioritize transactions offering higher fees. This ensures network resources are allocated efficiently, with complex or urgent transactions receiving faster processing times.\n\nTransparent Fee Structure: Gwei\u2019s clear and straightforward pricing model eliminates any ambiguity surrounding transaction costs. Users can easily understand the fee associated with each interaction, promoting trust and transparency within the Ethereum Virtual Machine .\n\nBottom Line\n\nIn a nutshell, Gwei isn\u2019t just a fee; it\u2019s the lifeblood of the Ethereum network. It fuels transactions, incentivizes verifiers, and ensures smooth resource allocation, all while maintaining transparency and decentralization."

        "title": "Ethereum Nodes and Clients Explained - LCX",
        "content": "Types of Ethereum Nodes\n\nThe Ethereum Node system functions according to the Point-to-Point network architecture. Three varieties of nodes exist:\n\nFull Nodes: A full node is tasked with the verification and validation of every transaction occurring within the network, in addition to upholding the blockchain\u2019s state. In the event of a smart contract transaction, full nodes proceed to execute every instruction contained within the smart contract. It ascertains whether the execution of the smart contract is yielding the anticipated outcomes. Each of these nodes upholds an exact replica of the blockchain data.\n\nIt continues to receive locally stored duplicates of the entire blockchain, including its own transactions and retains the most recent transaction state. In the event of a smart contract transaction, full nodes proceed to execute every instruction contained within the smart contract. It ascertains whether the execution of the smart contract is yielding the anticipated outcomes.\n\nLet us consider a scenario in which individual A conducts a transaction with individual B, which is subsequently appended to the blockchain. Subsequently, the full nodes examine the transaction to ensure that it adheres to all Ethereum specifications. If the transaction fails to comply, they either append the specification to the blockchain\u2019s current state or remove it. A transaction involving a discarder occurs when one individual transfers X ETH to another, but the recipient\u2019s account now contains a lesser amount of ETH.\n\nArchive Nodes: Archive nodes are full nodes that have been configured with the \u201carchive mode\u201d option. In contrast to Full Nodes, which solely retain the most recent transaction state, Archive nodes preserve the complete blockchain history, commencing from the genesis block.\n\nWhen requiring blocks anterior to the most recent 128 blocks, the Archive node is utilised. For instance, an archive node is necessary to utilise functions such as eth_getBalance of a historic address and to interact with smart contracts that were initiated in an earlier stage of the blockchain.\n\nArchive Nodes require more than 6 Terabytes of disc space due to their unique characteristic, whereas Full Nodes require only about 500 Gigabytes. Thus, it can be deduced that archive nodes are not practical for the general public; however, they prove to be advantageous when it comes to wallet vending, block perusing, and chain analytics.\n\nLight Nodes: A light node, in contrast to a full node, retains solely the block header and not the complete current blockchain state. It is appropriate for devices with limited memory and computational power, as the maintenance of a light node requires minimal hardware investment, operating expenses, and technical expertise. Full nodes are required for light nodes to operate. These nodes are not required to perpetually operate or transfer substantial volumes of data to and from the blockchain. It offers a straightforward method for creating a wallet, particularly for novices. Solid-state drives, for instance, are financially incapable of storing the gigabytes of data that other nodes consume. However, it is indisputable that light nodes have certain limitations; for instance, the availability of the light wallet provider during critical periods cannot be guaranteed.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum Client?\n\nA software application that implements the Ethereum specification and establishes connections with other Ethereum clients via a peer-to-peer network is known as an Ethereum client. Inter-client communication on Ethereum is feasible provided that each client adheres to the reference specification and predefined communication protocols. Although these numerous clients are developed using different programming languages and by different teams, they all \u201cspeak\u201d the same protocol and comply with the same regulations. They are consequently capable of interacting with and operating on the identical Ethereum network.\n\nThese exchanges occur among numerous clients in the network utilising programming languages such as Erigon (Go/Multi), Geth (Go), OpenEthereum (Rust), and Nethermind (C#,.NET). The Ethereum protocol, represented by the yellow paper, enables any user to execute a client and create a node.\n\nThe formal prerequisites that constitute the Ethereum blockchain set it apart from the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Core does not establish standardized behaviours that are mandatory for all Ethereum clients, in contrast to Ethereum. By utilizing a straightforward programming language and standardized documentation, Ethereum\u2019s specifications enabled the blockchain to support non-interoperable software implementations of its clients.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Clients\n\nThere are three types of Ethereum Clients:\n\nFull Client: Full clients store the entire Ethereum blockchain, which, according to the most recent estimates, requires more than one terabyte of disc space and may take several days to synchronize. Complete clients facilitate the ability of interconnected nodes to perform every network operation, such as mining, validating transactions and block headers, and executing smart contracts.\n\nLight Client: Ethereum clients are not always required to retain all data; therefore, developers frequently employ \u201clight clients\u201d when data storage and performance are critical. Light clients offer only a fraction of the capabilities of full clients. By virtue of not retaining the complete Ethereum blockchain, light clients are capable of facilitating expedited delivery while simultaneously liberating space for data storage.\n\nThe functionality of a light client is modified to suit the Ethereum client\u2019s requirements. For instance, light clients are extensively implemented in wallets for the purpose of preserving private keys and Ethereum addresses. Moreover, they oversee the broadcasting of transactions and smart contract interactions. In addition to exchange rate data and web3 instances embedded within JavaScript objects, light clients are also advantageous for Dapp browsers.\n\nRemote Client: A light client and a remote client are comparable. A key differentiation lies in the fact that a remote client does not maintain an independent copy of the blockchain or perform transaction or block header validation. In contrast, remote clients are solely dependent on a full or lite client in order to establish communication with the Ethereum blockchain network. The primary function of these clients is to operate as wallets for transaction transmission and reception.\n\nEthereum Node vs Ethereum Client\n\nEthereum Node Ethereum Client A machine running Ethereum client software is referred to as an \u201cEthereum Node\u201d. A client is an Ethereum implementation that validates all transactions in each block, ensuring the network\u2019s security and data accuracy. The three types of Ethereum Nodes are Full, Light, Archive, and Miner Nodes. The three types of Ethereum Clients are Full, Light, and Remote Clients. The Ethereum node operating system allows us to access the internet. The Ethereum client computer allows a user to access the node operating system.\n\nConclusion\n\nDelving into the intricate world of Ethereum nodes and clients reveals the backbone of this groundbreaking blockchain network. Nodes serve as the decentralized pillars, ensuring the network\u2019s resilience, security, and decentralization. On the client side, the diverse array of Ethereum clients, showcases the flexibility and openness of the Ethereum ecosystem. As Ethereum continues to evolve and transition, understanding the nuances of nodes and clients becomes increasingly crucial."

        "content": "Ethereum developers are expressing concerns over Vitalik Buterin\u2019s latest proposal to raise the gas limit by 33%, citing worries about the growing size of the blockchain state.\n\nThe second largest blockchain Ethereum is currently at a crossroads over a proposal by its co-founder Vitalik Buterin to increase its gas limit.\n\nOn Jan. 11, Buterin recommended a 33% increase in the gas limit, a change aimed at enhancing the network\u2019s throughput. The proposal suggests raising the limit from the current 30 million to 40 million, potentially allowing more transactions per block and increasing the network\u2019s capacity.\n\nThe concept of the gas limit has evolved since Ethereum\u2019s inception in 2015. Initially set at around 3 million, the limit has gradually increased in response to the network\u2019s growing usage and adoption.\n\nEthereum average gas limit through the years | Source: Etherscan\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain state, which stores account balances and smart contract data, currently requires approximately 267 gigabytes (GB) of space. The entire history of the blockchain is even larger, around 900GB, according to Blockchair.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin reveals 6 main focuses for Ethereum in 2024\n\nHowever, the proposal has met with some resistance.

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Lido Staked Ether All Popped This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency space has become a rather intriguing one to follow, particularly over the past week. For investors looking at the impressive moves made by Ethereum (ETH 1.14%), Ethereum Classic (ETC -0.51%) and Lido Staked Ether (CRYPTO:STETH), one might surmise that everything is sunshine and rainbows. After all, as of 3:30 p.m. ET, these three cryptos surged 16.3%, 47.3%, and 16.7%, respectively, over the past week.\n\nHowever, it's also the case that Bitcoin (BTC 1.94%) is actually trading exactly flat this week over the same time frame. After surging more than 10% to a multiyear high of more than $48,500 this week, Bitcoin has since given up all its weekly gains, trading back to the $43,800 level at the time of writing.\n\nThis move follows the highly anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which has completely changed the investing landscape in the crypto sector, probably for good. Interestingly, Ethereum and its related tokens are seeing impressive surges, suggesting these cryptos may have ultimately been the better way to play this event.\n\nLet's dive into why.\n\nThese ETF approvals may not be a \"sell the news\" event for all cryptos\n\nIt's usually a good rule of thumb to wait a few days to assess how the enthusiasm around a specific catalyst for any asset plays out. In this case, it appears most of the buying activity for Bitcoin took place prior to, and around, its ETF approvals. Since then, a \"sell the news\" narrative has grown, suggesting perhaps the hype around these approvals may have already been priced into Bitcoin heading into this key catalyst.\n\nHowever, the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sent ripple waves through the market. For Ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency (and one that regulators have also shown a favorable stance toward in the past), the potential for spot Ethereum ETF approvals has shot higher following this news. Investors hoping for a similar rally heading into future spot Ethereum ETF approvals may be simply looking to get ahead of this trade.\n\nFor Ethereum Classic (the proof-of-work fork of Ethereum) and Lido Staked Ether (staked Ethereum on Lido's liquid-staking network that can be redeemed 1 to 1 with Ethereum), a rising tide tends to lift all boats. What's good for Ethereum is generally good for these tokens and will continue to drive outsized interest in these higher-volatility Ethereum alternatives.\n\nThe optimal way to play a particular catalyst is typically difficult to ascertain\n\nIf you asked me heading into this week whether Bitcoin or Ethereum and its related tokens would have a better week, I probably would have said Bitcoin. Most of the momentum in this sector was firmly behind the gold standard in this space, and a surge in capital (which could be as much as $100 billion) into Bitcoin should, in theory, lead to massive support for the world's largest cryptocurrency. These fundamentals remain in play. However, it's becoming clearer that much of the anticipation around these approvals had been priced in prior to the announcement.\n\nGiven how fast the crypto world moves, Bitcoin ETF approvals are now old news. Investors appear to be clearly focused on the next token with the biggest potential catalyst out there, and that's Ethereum right now."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum continues to assert its dominance, proving to investors and enthusiasts why it reigns supreme among altcoins. The recent price action of Ethereum paints a bullish narrative, with potential signals pointing toward an ongoing growth cycle that could redefine its market stature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's market movement has been extremely dominant following the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, with the asset recently piercing through significant resistance levels. After a sustained period above the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, ETH has shown formidable strength.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum's price hovers around $2,600, with the immediate resistance level now likely forming near the $2,700 mark, a point at which sellers previously stepped in. A decisive break above this level could open the gates for further escalation toward the $3,000 psychological barrier.\n\nETH/USD Chart by TradingView\n\nOn the flip side, local support can be identified at around the $2,500 level, where a confluence of the EMAs and historical price reactions provides a safety net against potential pullbacks. Should Ethereum retreat from its current levels, the $2,400 and $2,300 levels stand ready to act as secondary and tertiary support zones, where buying interest has coalesced in the past.\n\nThe backdrop to this vigorous market movement is the speculation regarding the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF. The recent green light for a Bitcoin spot ETF has amplified discussions around its Ethereum counterpart. Such approval would be a significant catalyst for Ethereum, potentially drawing in a new wave of institutional and retail investment.\n\nThe primary strength of a spot Ethereum ETF lies in its direct exposure to the actual asset, rather than the derivatives market that futures-based ETFs represent. This means that an ETF would purchase actual Ethereum, providing direct support to its price and reflecting true market sentiment more accurately. Moreover, it would offer investors a way to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of managing cryptocurrency wallets and keys, thereby simplifying entry onto the crypto market.\n\nThe approval of an Ethereum ETF would not only validate the asset's maturity and market significance but also solidify its position as a mainstay in the portfolios of diverse investors. Given Ethereum's foundational role in the development of DeFi and NFTs, an ETF would be a testament to its integral place in the digital economy.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF here\n\nDespite the approval of one of the most long-awaited financial products for the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin displayed a stoic reaction, subverting the expectations of many investors, who were bracing for a significant market upheaval. The cryptocurrency's price stability post-ETF news, while surprising to some, has been a more favorable outcome compared to the sell-off that many had predicted.\n\nThe relative calmness in Bitcoin's price has provided a conducive backdrop for altcoins to shine. Ethereum (ETH) notably breached the $2,500 mark, and Solana (SOL) regained a $100 valuation, underscoring a night of triumph for alternative cryptocurrencies. This decoupling of Bitcoin's movement from altcoin performance is a phenomenon that has been increasingly observed, suggesting a maturing market where assets can thrive on individual merit and ecosystem developments.\n\nThe chart at hand paints a picture of consolidation for Bitcoin, with the price hovering around the $45,000 region. The lack of a significant corrective move post-ETF news has lent a supportive floor to the broader crypto market. Trading volumes, alongside price action, indicate a steady holding pattern, a sign that the market is digesting the recent developments without panic or overenthusiasm.\n\nDespite the current stability, the market should not discount the potential for an uptick in Bitcoin\u2019s value. Historically, actual capital inflow following such regulatory milestones has been a precursor to upward movements in the cryptocurrency's price. If history is to serve as a reference, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF may yet act as a delayed fuse, igniting a rally as new capital finds its way onto the market.\n\nInvestors are advised to maintain cautious optimism. While current market conditions have not triggered the volatility many feared, the introduction of ETFs is a substantial change to the investment landscape of Bitcoin. As traditional investors and institutions increasingly engage with Bitcoin through these new financial products, the potential for a significant impact on the cryptocurrency\u2019s value trajectory is tangible."

        "content": "Bitcoin ETFs backed by actual bitcoin finally hit US exchanges on Thursday after more than a decade of attempts. So far it\u2019s done mostly nothing for bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin briefly neared $49,000 after the spot ETFs went live but it has since shed about $3,000 to retrace by 6%.\n\nThat\u2019s even slightly below where it was before the SEC\u2019s social media hacker posted an authorized approval announcement about the ETFs on Tuesday, about 24 hours before legitimate confirmation.\n\nAny boon to the price of bitcoin seems to have come way earlier. Bitcoin traded around $25,000 before BlackRock filed for its spot ETF last June and rallied 20% within days.\n\nWith the post-BlackRock pump, bitcoin had reclaimed its pre-Terra implosion price.\n\nBitcoin would give up those gains in the weeks following. But by mid-October, a fake news tweet claiming the SEC had approved BlackRock\u2019s bid set bitcoin on a major uptrend.\n\nThere was immediate volatility around the tweet \u2014 climbing $2,000 and down again within 30 minutes \u2014 but bitcoin ended up shooting nearly two-thirds in two months, from $27,700 to $44,000 in December.\n\nAt this rate, ether could soon overtake bitcoin for six-month returns\n\nAbout there it hovered until earlier this week. Analysts, researchers, traders and pundits were generally in consensus that the SEC would indeed approve spot ETFs for launch in the US, and come Monday bitcoin had jumped 8% to clear $47,000 for the first time in almost two years.\n\nAll things considered, the bitcoin spot ETF approval was massively front-run by those trading on the rumor. Anyone who bought bitcoin when word of BlackRock\u2019s filing first broke last year would now be up by more than half.\n\nAnyone who bought bitcoin when the ETFs were officially approved would now be about even and could even be down slightly.\n\nHad they opted for ether, they\u2019d be up to 8% in the green, as traders appear looking to frontrun the next potential wave of crypto spot ETF approvals in the US.\n\nBlackRock and other issuers including Fidelity, VanEck and Invesco Galaxy have filed for a spot ether ETF since lodging their equivalent bitcoin applications. The SEC has between late May and early August to make its first decision.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin and ether diverge after SEC\u2019s bitcoin ETF snafu\n\nIn the meantime, markets seem to be waiting to find out exactly how much bitcoin BlackRock, Fidelity and other ETF issuers actually bought to back their respective funds after a busy day-one session, when more than $4.6 billion in spot ETF shares were traded in the US overall.\n\nIn and outflow figures would be the first indications of investor interest and could shed light on their potential influence on bitcoin prices moving forward.\n\nSome preliminary figures have been floated on social media but analysts warn they may not be totally accurate. Confirmed data is only expected to be completely accurate later in the day, or even early next week.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation is set to push through major changes to the account abstraction standard in Ethereum to reduce gas consumption \u2014 particularly for layer 2s.\n\nOn Jan. 10, the Ethereum Foundation shared a preview of the drastic changes to the ERC-4337 standard specification, which deals with account abstraction, also known as smart accounts.\n\nThe new version 0.7 applies learnings from nine months of ERC-4337 being used, according to developer John Rising in an update shared with Cointelegraph.\n\nThe biggest change is in the structure of account abstraction transactions, which are more complex than regular Ether (ETH) transactions. These now require specifying five gas values instead of just one.\n\n\u201cThe user has to specify more than one gas value to account for the fact that an account can do computation while its signature is being checked,\u201d explained Rising.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Rising elaborated on why more gas values were required.\n\n\u201cWith smart accounts, users can have many different types of signatures and pay for gas in many ways. This means that the amount of gas required varies, and the transaction has to specify how much it is willing to spend for this validation.\u201d\n\nThis makes gas estimation more accurate and reduces gas costs, especially on layer-2 networks, since these changes reduce the amount of data that needs to be published.\n\n\u201cThe major benefits of v0.7 for users will be reduced gas fees,\u201d explained Rising, who added, \u201cIt uses some tricks to use transaction data more efficiently, which is particularly helpful on layer-2 blockchains.\u201d\n\nThe new specification will also penalize users 10% for all unused gas in execution, \u201cwhich prevents apps from putting transactions with unnecessarily high gas limits.\u201d\n\nHow account abstraction works. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nAccount abstraction, also known as smart accounts, builds upon basic Ethereum accounts by allowing accounts to have programmable logic and rules, opening up many new use cases that are impossible with simple accounts today.\n\nEthereum accounts today are somewhat passive and static, but account abstraction allows them to become active and programmable. It was proposed in September 2021 by Vitalik Buterin and other developers in EIP-4337.\n\nRelated: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin calls for 33% increase in gas limit\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has not announced an expected date for version v0.7 but said that the security audit is beginning now.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that everything will be finalized by ETHDenver at the end of February,\u201d said Rising.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

        "title": "Bitcoin Drops 6.3% and Drags Ethereum and Dogecoin Down With It - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The approval of a Bitcoin (BTC 1.93%) ETF was supposed to bring billions of dollars into the crypto industry, but in typical fashion, investors bought the rumor and sold the news. As of 2:30 p.m. ET, Bitcoin is down 6.3% in the last 24 hours, and the selling accelerated early this morning.\n\nEthereum (ETH 1.22%) has rallied the last few days but dropped 3.7% between 10 a.m. ET and 2:30 p.m. ET. Dogecoin (DOGE 5.20%) plunged 3.9% in just the last few hours as well.\n\nBuy the rumor, sell the news\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF approval was months in the making, and when these ETFs were announced on Wednesday, Jan. 10, the market started to sell off. A lot of traders had bought in anticipation of the ETFs (buying the rumor) and then began selling when there was no longer a catalyst to count on in the future (sell the news).\n\nTo be fair, Bitcoin has been flat in the past week, Ethereum is up 10%, and Dogecoin is down just 0.4%. So there hasn't been a big move if you pull back a bit.\n\nI do think it's notable that Ethereum has gained as much as it has. The speculation trade has likely moved to the second-largest cryptocurrency, which could eventually be a popular ETF asset as well.\n\nTechnology takes it on the chin\n\nCryptocurrency doesn't trade in a vacuum, either. Over the last three years, cryptocurrency has traded with high-growth tech stocks, and they're having a terrible day.\n\nLayoffs at Cloudflare, Alphabet, Discord, and dozens of other companies are calling into question the growth we should expect for 2024. There's still a delayed realization in parts of the tech industry that growth is slowing and costs need to come under control if companies are going to be profitable.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily impact cryptocurrencies directly, but if cryptocurrencies trade with growth tech stocks, it's not surprising to see a sell-off.\n\nWhat we don't know matters most\n\nThe theory of the last few months in cryptocurrencies was that an ETF approval would bring new buyers into the crypto market, bringing billions of dollars with them. But will that be the case?\n\nIt seems to me that buying cryptocurrencies is easy enough for anyone who wanted to buy some over the last few years. An ETF may make it easier in some ways, but it also comes with fees that are unnecessary for cryptocurrencies you can hold in self-custody.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if cryptocurrencies continue to fall as the market realizes that new money isn't coming in as expected following ETF approvals. And there's no increased utilization of the blockchain for innovative purposes if assets are held in an ETF.\n\nThis week has been more volatile than even a normal week in crypto. Don't be surprised if that's the theme for the next few weeks as the market figures out who is buying crypto to hold and who was just speculating on ETF approvals. There may be more speculation going on than investors would like to think."

        "content": "Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin proposes a 33% increase in the gas limit to improve network throughput. This first change in three years aims to balance efficiency and stability, addressing scalability.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently advocated for a significant change in the Ethereum network: a 33% increase in the gas limit, from 30 million to 40 million. This proposal, made during a Reddit Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) session organized by the Ethereum Foundation's research team, marks the first suggested change in the gas limit in nearly three years\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nUnderstanding the Gas Limit and Its Impact\n\nThe Ethereum network's gas limit is a crucial parameter, determining the maximum amount of gas that can be used for transactions and smart contracts in each block. Gas, essentially the fee required for transactions or contract executions on Ethereum, is measured in gwei, a fraction of the cryptocurrency Ether (ETH)\u200b\u200b.\n\nAn increase in the gas limit is significant because it directly impacts network throughput \u2013 the number of transactions Ethereum can handle. Since the network's inception in 2015, the gas limit has been periodically adjusted to reflect growing usage and adoption. However, the last three years have seen no change, the longest such period in Ethereum's history\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nBalancing Efficiency and Network Stability\n\nButerin's proposal aims to enhance network efficiency by allowing more transactions per block, thereby theoretically increasing the network's overall capacity. However, this comes with the need to balance improved throughput with potential risks, including increased loads on hardware and heightened vulnerability to spam and attacks\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nEthereum's gas fees have seen notable fluctuations, with significant spikes during periods of high demand, such as the inscriptions craze of May 2023, which saw gas fees reaching 150 gwei. The proposed increase is seen as a step towards accommodating growing transaction volumes more efficiently, while also addressing scalability issues that have been a long-standing concern in the crypto community\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nLooking Ahead: Ethereum's Scalability and Future\n\nButerin's suggestion is not just about immediate relief for the network; it also hints at Ethereum's ongoing scalability challenges. The gas limit increase is seen as a temporary measure, pending the full deployment of the Ethereum 2.0 update, which promises significant improvements in network efficiency and scalability\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe decision to increase the gas limit, therefore, stands at a critical juncture for Ethereum, balancing between immediate network demands and long-term strategic goals. It also underscores the continuous evolution and adaptation that blockchains like Ethereum undergo to meet the demands of their growing user base.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

Fink\u2019s comments come on the heels of 11 spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) being approved by the US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission). US investors have long asked for spot ETFs for the cryptocurrency space.\n\nJUST IN: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says they \"see value in having an Ethereum ETF.\" \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) January 12, 2024\n\nAlso Read: Spot Ethereum ETF To Follow Spot Bitcoin ETF: Says Analyst\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has already applied for a spot ETH ETF. Other firms that have submitted applications include VanEck, 21Shares & ARK, Grayscale, etc..\n\nWill the SEC approve a spot Ethereum ETF?\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nThe SEC\u2019s final deadline for a decision on VanEck\u2019s spot ETH ETF application is May 23, 2024. The final deadline for BlackRock\u2019s application, on the other hand, is on Aug. 7, 2024.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, there is a 70% chance that the SEC will approve an Ethereum (ETH) ETF by May 2024. According to the analyst, \u2018The Ether spot is tied to the hip of [the] Bitcoin spot for sure. It\u2019s gonna go wherever it goes. It\u2019s essentially on a 15-foot rope following it.\u2018\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: SEC May Approve ETH ETF in May, Says Bloomberg\n\nBalchunas was previously cautious about a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF. However, the analyst has since changed his stance. Balchunas is optimistic about an Ethereum (ETH) ETF and has a high approval chance.\n\nOn the other hand, digital asset lawyer Joe Carlasare believes a spot ETH ETF will receive approval from the SEC, but it may take longer than expected.\n\nA spot Ethereum ETF could lead to significant institutional funding for the second-largest cryptocurrency. With a spot BTC ETF already approved, a spot ETH ETF could send the crypto market into a new bull run. However, there is a possibility that the SEC will postpone its decision due to technical reasons."

Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum price has been displaying enough strength by sustaining above the crucial zone for a significant period\n\nWith the rise in optimism, the higher targets have been elevated frequently and hence the ETH price is expected to barge in soon\n\nThe crypto markets have been filled with hope soon after the fresh CPI rates went in favour of the space. Although the Bitcoin price failed to react positively, it sustained strongly and defended the lower support, suggesting the token is well prepared for the next rally. Besides being the second largest token, Ethereum is also following the star token but displaying more potential and strength, which may even surpass Bitcoin in terms of gains.\n\nSoon after the SEC officially approved all the spot Bitcoin ETF applications, the crypto space, including ETH prices, roared beyond their respective resistances. While a decent pullback was expected, the token managed to sustain above the gains, displaying the dominance of the bulls. Regardless of the mountaineering selling pressure, the token is expected to maintain a healthy upswing and is speculated to rise beyond the pivotal targets.\n\nA popular analyst, Michael van de Poppe, in his recent analysis, has lauded the bullish strength and hence believes the price may make it to $3500 very soon.\n\nIn the above chart, the analyst highlights the price sticking above the levels around $2,140 for quite a long time. As a result, the levels had become a strong support zone but were failing to trigger a healthy upswing towards the next higher target. However, the recent breakout has partially changed the scenario, which now suggests a continuation beyond $2700 could be imminent.\n\n\u201cEthereum flipped the crucial level at $2,130 for continuation, After that, breakout towards new cycle highs at $2,700 and looking for continuation to $3,500 in the coming 2-3 months,\u201d\n\nCollectively, the ETH price continues to display extreme strength regardless of the bearish pressure slowly intensifying. The price after breaching the crucial resistance zone is accumulating strength and hence is believed to trigger a fresh upswing towards $2,700 initially, which may pave the way for a major breakout above $3000."

Despite the optimism, SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s previous statements suggest a cautious approach to approving crypto asset securities, particularly for assets other than Bitcoin.\n\nThe price increase reflects a broader market sentiment that an Ethereum ETF could soon follow the path of Bitcoin ETFs, with firms like BlackRock and Ark having filed applications.\n\nThe possibility of an Ethereum ETF has sparked discussions about the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities, a debate that could impact the SEC\u2019s decision-making process."

        "content": "BlackRock\u2019s CEO has dropped hints of a finance landscape upheaval as he openly touts Ethereum.\n\nSmart money has discreetly flown towards Ethereum reflecting a growing confidence in its potential.\n\nAnalysts have cautioned against overinterpretation as DeFi volumes have remained modest compared to centralized exchanges.\n\nThe winds of change are sweeping through the digital finance landscape, with whispers of a potential Ethereum revolution spearheaded by none other than BlackRock, the world\u2019s financial behemoth. This shift, hinted at by CEO Larry Fink\u2019s recent remarks, could have profound implications for the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\n\nBlackRock CEO Sees Ethereum as \u201cStore of Value\u201d\n\nFink, a traditionally conservative figure in the financial world, surprised many with his open support for Ethereum, calling it \u201ca store of value\u201d with significant potential.\n\nThis endorsement, coming from the head of an asset manager with over $10 trillion under its wing, carries immense weight, sending ripples of excitement through the crypto community. This pivot by BlackRock isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum.\n\nIt coincides with the recent approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF, a landmark event that signaled increased mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, smart money, the lifeblood of sophisticated investors, has been quietly flowing towards Ethereum in recent weeks, suggesting a growing confidence in its potential.\n\nSmart Money Bets on Ethereum\n\nWhile Fink\u2019s words don\u2019t guarantee immediate action from BlackRock, they do paint a picture of a future where Ethereum plays a central role in institutional investment strategies. This, in turn, could lead to a surge in adoption, solidifying its position as a leading cryptocurrency and potentially opening the doors for other blockchain technologies to gain wider acceptance.\n\n\n\nHowever, analysts caution against overinterpreting the current trend. Nansen analyst Martin Lee emphasizes that DeFi volumes, where smart money flows are often tracked, are still relatively small compared to centralized exchanges. Large price movements, therefore, may be primarily driven by activity on traditional platforms, which lack the same level of transparency.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nDespite the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF, this alone does not guarantee a seamless path for Ethereum.\n\nThough there is a flow of smart money towards Ethereum, the volumes in the decentralized finance sector are still comparatively small.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nDespite the need for measured optimism, Fink\u2019s endorsement marks a significant step forward for the cryptocurrency industry. As institutional interest continues to grow, Ethereum\u2019s position as a major player in the digital finance arena seems increasingly secure. Whether this translates into a full-fledged BlackRock-backed ETF remains to be seen.\n\nTo delve deeper into the surge of SHIB and BONE bolstered by Ethereum whale activity, explore the dynamics shaping this rise here:\n\nSHIB, BONE Rise Up, Backed by Soaring Ethereum Whale Activity\n\n\n\nTo explore the surges in Ethereum and Ethereum Classic post-SEC Bitcoin ETF approval, read here:\n\nEthereum, ETC Skyrocket Following SEC\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Approval"

        "content": "A JPMorgan executive suggested on Jan. 12 that securities regulators are equally likely to approve or disapprove a spot Ethereum ETF in the coming months.\n\nNikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a Managing Director for JPMorgan, told The Block:\n\n\u201cIn our opinion, for the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] to approve spot Ethereum ETFs in May, it would need to classify Ethereum as a commodity (similar to bitcoin) rather than a security \u2026 This is far from given, and I wouldn\u2019t put more than a 50% chance to the SEC classifying Ethereum as a commodity before May.\u201d\n\nHe added that the SEC is \u201cstill signaling that it continues to view all other cryptocurrencies outside bitcoin as securities.\u201d\n\nPanigirtzoglou\u2019s comments allude to a statement from SEC chair Gary Gensler regarding spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) approvals on Jan. 11.\n\nThere, Gensler said that the latest approvals concern only ETPs holding Bitcoin (BTC) and identified Bitcoin as a non-security commodity. Gensler added that the approvals should not signal the SEC\u2019s views on the securities status of other crypto assets; he also asserted that the \u201cvast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts\u201d and therefore under federal securities laws.\n\nOther sources predict up to 70% approval odds\n\nDespite Panigirtzoglou\u2019s low approval estimate, some sources place higher odds on an upcoming spot Ethereum ETF approval. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has predicted a 70% chance of such an approval by May.\n\nOne prediction market on Polymarket suggests that there is a 57% chance of an Ethereum ETF approval by May 31. Those odds are based on over $15,000 worth of cryptocurrency bets rather than any individual\u2019s personal stance.\n\nPredictions largely focus on May because the SEC must decide on a spot Ethereum ETF application from VanEck by May 23. Other applicants including BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, ARK Invest, and Invesco Galaxy have also filed for spot Ethereum ETFs, but with later decision deadlines.\n\nThe SEC approved a number of ETFs that included Ethereum futures in October 2023 but has not yet approved a spot Ethereum ETF."

        "title": "Top 9 Blockchain Platforms to Consider in 2024 - TechTarget",
        "content": "Interest in blockchain platforms has been growing significantly as a way to streamline supply chains, improve traceability, simplify trade and improve financial transactions. A lot of this interest started with the speculative frenzy surrounding Bitcoin, which is based on an older blockchain platform that faces challenges with energy consumption and speed.\n\nModern blockchain platforms have been developed to help overcome these limitations and provide practical value for other business uses and applications. \"We are seeing multiple enterprises adopt blockchain platforms for some of their application needs,\" said Suseel Menon, practice director at Everest Group, an IT advisory firm.\n\nMenon has seen the most interest in areas that require multiparty cooperation or data exchange. Blockchain applications in supply chain tracking, trade finance, digital assets and identity management are going beyond the pilot stage. Menon has also seen a fair bit of activity in using blockchain platforms for building certain functions of ERP, such as vendor management and supply chain management (SCM).\n\nAlex-Paul Manders, a partner at Information Services Group, an IT advisory firm, said the evolution of blockchain platforms to date has promoted heightened awareness of decentralized finance, or DeFi, for driving new business models that pose significant threats to traditional banking, finance and supply chain finance.\n\nAlex-Paul Manders Alex-Paul Manders\n\nManders predicted that blockchain platforms could disrupt legacy supply chain businesses and technology processes. For example, U.S. requirements for pharmaceutical companies to track and trace products and materials call for a new approach for supply chain participants to share and transact data more efficiently and with more transparency than previously required. Blockchain technology could be the answer.\n\nAccording to Menon, the top three blockchain frameworks for these use cases are R3 Corda, Hyperledger and Ethereum, with EOSIO and ConsenSys Quorum gaining ground.\n\nHere are nine of the top blockchain platforms to consider.\n\n1. Ethereum Introduced in 2013, Ethereum is one of the oldest and most established blockchain platforms. It provides a truly decentralized blockchain that is comparable to the Bitcoin blockchain network. Manders said its key strength is that it enables true decentralization with support for smart contracts. Its key weaknesses include slow processing times and higher transaction processing costs compared to other platforms. Besides its role as a blockchain platform that underpins enterprise applications, it has its own cryptocurrency called Ether. Suseel Menon Suseel Menon The Ethereum platform has seen widespread adoption by technologists who build decentralized applications, or dApps, on the Ethereum network. For example, there are numerous platforms and exchanges for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) -- a type of digital asset that can be exchanged on a blockchain. It has a mature ecosystem of tools for writing smart contracts using the Solidity programming environment, which runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. However, alternative blockchain networks can process transactions much faster at potentially lower cost than Ethereum, though many observers expect this to change after Ethereum adopts a more efficient security mechanism. It also has an active developer community orchestrated by the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which has more than 250 members, including Intel, JPMorgan and Microsoft. The Ethereum community migrated from a proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof of stake (PoS), which is more energy-friendly. The migration required an elaborate process to spin up a separate, new type of blockchain called a Beacon Chain that has been merged into the existing main Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum Foundation estimated this reduces energy use by 99.95% compared to the older approach. The community was previously considering sharding, which involved splitting up the Ethereum blockchain to expand the capacity to store data, scale throughput and cut network fees. However, new techniques for combining transactions to be processed together, called layer 2 rollups, evolved faster than expected, and sharding was dropped from the roadmap. Now the community is focusing on a simpler approach, called Proto-Danksharding, which streamlines layer 2 rollups. The goal is to eventually support up to 100,000 transactions per second using this new approach. There are many things to consider when choosing a blockchain platform, including performance and cost.\n\n2. IBM Blockchain IBM Blockchain is a private, decentralized blockchain network that has been the most successful with enterprise clients who are less risk-averse, Manders said. He has seen the biggest opportunities in using it to link into enterprise cloud and legacy technologies more seamlessly than is possible in other decentralized networks. The IBM Blockchain developer tool was designed to be flexible, functional and customizable. IBM has also invested in creating a user-friendly interface to simplify critical tasks, such as setting up, testing and rapidly deploying smart contracts. Rakesh Mohan, IBM director of development, blockchain, said the company has seen significant progress in financial services and banking, as well as supply chain. Rakesh Mohan Rakesh Mohan Some examples of successful blockchain apps include IBM Food Trust, which has completed more than 18 million transactions representing more than 17,000 products, and Blockchain Community Initiative in Thailand, which supports services such as payment obligations and enterprise auctions for 22 Thai banks. IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply is designed to help enterprises improve traceability in supply chain management. Top features support quality assurance for validating the provenance of materials, improved forecasting and tools to reduce the cost of dispute resolution, product recalls and document sharing. Various tools help manufacturing, retail, pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies jump-start their blockchain rollout.\n\n3. Hyperledger Fabric Hyperledger Fabric is a set of tools for creating blockchain applications. Championed by the Linux Foundation, it was built from the ground up with enterprise distributed ledger uses in mind. It has a rich ecosystem of components that can be plugged into a modular architecture. It works well in closed blockchain deployments, which can improve security and speed. It also supports an open smart contract model that can support various data models, such as account and unspent transaction output (UTXO) models. Hyperledger Fabric can also improve data privacy by isolating transactions in channels or enabling the sharing of private data on a need-to-know basis in private data collections. It also enables high-speed transactions with low latency of finality and confirmation, according to its proponents. It is supported by leading cloud providers including Amazon Web Services, IBM, Google, Microsoft Azure and Oracle. Arnaud Le Hors, senior technical staff member of open technologies at IBM, said the latest developments add support for an organization to join a channel without copying the whole history of the ledger. This enables a quicker startup process with less storage required. There is an active and diverse community around Hyperledger Fabric that is working on adding more features related to consensus algorithms, additional privacy options for GDPR compliance and operational improvements. Key features to consider Blockchain platforms consist of a wide range of components, which enables enterprises to select the appropriate components for different kinds of capabilities, said Chris Georgen, founder and managing director at Topl, which built a blockchain for sustainability. Chris Georgen Chris Georgen Georgen recommended examining four features when evaluating platforms: Whether a platform is open (public) or closed (private) and how that affects speed and security. Anyone can join a public blockchain, which can make it easier to set up for small businesses. The downside is open blockchains aren't as fast. Many blockchain codebases can be modified to be either open or closed. Consensus mechanism, such as PoW, PoS or Byzantine fault tolerance. PoW is the older mechanism used in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The others are newer and less proven but faster and more efficient, Georgen said. Ledger technology and how it records transactions. Popular approaches include an account model and UTXO. An account model records the balance, whereas UTXO is analogous to cash with serial numbers. The account model is used in Ethereum, Stellar, Tron and EOSIO. IBM Blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Sawtooth use UTXO. Smart contract functions for capturing business logic on the blockchain. Popular programming languages include Ethereum Solidity, WebAssembly languages and Digital Asset Modeling Language.\n\n4. Hyperledger Sawtooth Another open source blockchain initiative hosted by Hyperledger and the Linux Foundation is Hyperledger Sawtooth. One of its key advantages is that it allows enterprises to choose from several consensus mechanisms for different use cases. One novel consensus mechanism called proof of elapsed time can integrate with hardware-based security technologies to enable \"trusted execution environments\" of program code to run in secure enclaves, which are protected areas of computer memory. It also supports practical Byzantine fault tolerance which can allow nodes to reach consensus if hackers or other bad actors compromise some nodes. Sawtooth Raft uses a leader-based consensus algorithm that provides crash tolerance for a private and controlled group of users. Shawn Amundson Shawn Amundson Shawn Amundson, principal consultant at Bitwise IO, said the most common applications are for developing supply chain systems and customizing Sawtooth for specific purposes, such as novel consensus algorithms. A Sawtooth library enables developers of custom distributed ledgers to pick and choose which pieces of Sawtooth they use in their application. Sawtooth also supports Splinter for networking, which provides dynamic private circuits (groups of nodes); Hyperledger Transact for transaction processing to enhance smart contract capabilities; and Augrim for consensus, which expands the number of supported algorithms.\n\n5. R3 Corda There is some debate whether R3 Corda is technically a blockchain or an alternative type of distributed ledger. It uses a novel consensus mechanism in which transactions are cryptographically linked but does not periodically batch multiple transactions into a block. Even the official Corda site describes it as \"both a blockchain and not a blockchain.\" One of the key benefits of this approach is that all transactions are processed in real time, which can improve performance compared to other types of blockchains. The R3 consortium has a strong following in the financial industry, since Corda provides an attractive approach for financial transactions and smart contracts with strong security. Leading proponents include Bank of America, HSBC, Intel and Microsoft. It supports tools that automate business logic that can execute across company boundaries. In 2022, the group launched a technical preview of Corda Payments, which it claimed will simplify the process for building distributed payment capabilities into apps. A recent platform update purportedly improves availability and scalability and supports interoperability with other platforms. One key innovation is a delivery-versus-payment mechanism designed to improve settlement with other distributed ledger platforms. Manders said Corda has a strong chance of becoming the de facto network of insurance-related transaction processing. However, it faces competition from other federated blockchain networks that can process transactions faster and cheaper.\n\n6. Tezos In development since 2014, Tezos is an older platform that supports decentralized applications, smart contracts and novel financial instruments, such as NFTs, which can be thought of as a modern variation on trading cards that are tied to digital assets. The platform supports a dynamically upgradable protocol and modular software clients that enable it to adapt to new uses. It supports a PoS consensus mechanism that improves efficiency compared to Bitcoin and the original Ethereum implementation. An on-chain upgrade mechanism allows developers to add new features without forking, which would require spinning up a new blockchain and migrating users over. The Tezos community has been upgrading the platform at a rapid clip with enhancements that improved performance and increased the size limit on smart contracts. It has also developed tools to help automate the process of weaving NFTs into enterprise supply chains. The latest update proposal, called the Oxford 2 protocol, promises several new enhancements. An improved PoS mechanism creates new roles for nodes. The update also reintroduces a new version of timelocks (which was previously removed), to improve security and smart rollups to speed up the transaction rate.\n\n7. EOSIO The EOSIO blockchain platform was first launched as an open source project in 2018. It's optimized for developing decentralized applications and smart contracts. It uses a complex consensus mechanism based on PoS that provides better performance than older mechanisms, such as Ethereum, according to its proponents. It also includes support for a governance feature for voting on changes to the platform. Key strengths include fast transactions and advanced account permission features for deploying applications. Over 400 applications have been developed on the platform, including identity management, SCM and gaming. The community also provides tools for customizing blockchain implementations for various decentralized use cases in SCM, healthcare and DeFi. EOSIO-Taurus, a new blockchain released in June, was forked from the EOSIO codebase and is designed for enterprise performance on private blockchains. It includes features to handle a larger volume of transactions more securely and to improve resilience, automatic failover and disaster recovery. In addition, it could make it easier to connect the blockchain to external systems. New debugging tools are meant to improve smart contract development.\n\n8. Stellar Stellar is a newer blockchain platform optimized for various kinds of DeFi applications. It uses Stellar Consensus Protocol, which purportedly can speed up the time required to process and finalize transactions on a public blockchain network. It also includes security mechanisms for shutting out bad or questionable actors in a financial transaction. It has been adopted by several companies for international trade and exchanging money across borders. Examples of applications built on the Stellar blockchain include MoneyGram for money transfer, Circle for payments and treasury infrastructure, and Flutterwave for integrating payment processing into enterprise applications. The Soroban smart contract platform helps streamline development of Web 3.0 and DeFi applications on Stellar."

        "content": "Ethereum developers, node operators and users have yet to agree on Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recent suggestion to increase the gas limit on Ethereum.\n\nOn Jan. 11, Buterin advocated for a \u201cmodest\u201d 33% gas limit increase to potentially improve network throughput.\n\nIncreasing the gas limit to the proposed 40 million from the current 30 million would allow more transactions for each block, theoretically increasing the overall throughput and capacity of the network, he argued.\n\nHowever, there are some drawbacks, according to Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden, who aired his concerns in a Jan. 11 blog post titled \u201cWhy increasing the gas limit is difficult.\u201d\n\nThe primary concern would be the increase in the size of the blockchain state, which contains account balances and smart contract data.\n\nThe total space needed right now is roughly 267 gigabytes (GB) only for the state, he said, adding, \u201cIf we increase the gas limit, this size will grow even quicker.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain full history data size is currently around 900GB, according to Blockchair.\n\nWijden argued that storage is cheap, so size is not the issue, and everyone will be able to store that amount of data, \u201chowever, accessing and modifying it will become slower and slower,\u201d before adding there are \u201cno concrete solutions yet for state growth.\u201d\n\nMoreover, higher limits also raise synchronization times and make building diverse clients harder, he added.\n\nI wrote down some of my thoughts on raising the gas limit today: https://t.co/gX0eihUyYa\n\n\n\n(Haven't proof-read it, so if you find a mistake, you can keep it) \u2014 MariusVanDerWijden (@vdWijden) January 11, 2024\n\nGnosis co-founder Martin K\u00f6ppelmann also aired concerns, stating there would also be an increase in bandwidth should the gas limit be raised.\n\nEthereum team lead P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi was another who echoed concerns about increasing gas limits.\n\n\u201cIncreasing it definitely has a downside. State will grow faster, sync time will get slower quicker, DoS potential will grow.\u201d\n\nThe gas limit refers to the maximum amount of work and gas spent executing Ethereum transactions or smart contracts in each block. It is set to ensure that blocks are not too large, which would impact network performance and synchronization.\n\nPotential solutions include upgrades like EIP-4444 tackling chain history expiration and EIP-4844 for rollup data availability using \u201cblobs,\u201d which will help curb long-term growth trends.\n\nRelated: Big changes coming to Ethereum\u2019s account abstraction to save on gas\n\nSoftware developer Micah Zoltu replied to Vitalik\u2019s Reddit post, saying that the goal should be enabling real-world users to run Ethereum nodes on their everyday machines. However, this will be a greater challenge as the state and full blockchain size grows over time.\n\n\u201cOur goal should not be to ensure that you can run an Ethereum node on an $X machine. It should be that demographic X can run an Ethereum node,\u201d he said.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

His comments also alluded to BTC\u2019s hardcoded 21 million supply with the halving upcoming in April, touting scarcity as one factor behind future price increments.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Cryptik1E/status/1745776244745289934?s=20\n\nYou might also like: Vanguard, other tradfi giants boycott spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nBlackRock was one of 11 issuers the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved to begin trading spot Bitcoin ETFs across registered national exchanges like the Nasdaq.

Gensler further emphasized that approval for BTC ETFs was not an endorsement of Bitcoin or other blockchain digital assets, noting that the Grayscale ruling essentially promoted the SEC\u2019s decision.\n\nGensler specifically addressed Bitcoin as a \u201cnon-security commodity\u201d, a designation withheld from other cryptocurrencies like ETH.

        "content": "Crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe recently made a bullish prediction for the Ethereum price against Bitcoin in the near future, noting the path for this to happen. According to a social media post by the analyst, price action on the ETH/BTC pair for the next months will center around spot Bitcoin ETFs, with a rotation into ETH also in the prediction.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s Prediction of 100% Ethereum Price Rise Against Bitcoin\n\nMicha\u00ebl Van De Poppe recently took to X to share a chart of Ethereum\u2019s price performance against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC pair) on the weekly timeframe. Price action on the chart forms green (bullish) candles during periods of Ethereum\u2019s performance over Bitcoin, while red (bearish) candles are formed during periods of Ethereum\u2019s underperformance against Bitcoin.\n\nTaking a look at the chart shared by Van De Poppe shows that Ethereum\u2019s performance on the ETH/BTC pair has been on a decline since the middle of 2022. This decline particularly increased during the last quarter of 2023, as the enthusiasm regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs led to a surge in the price of Bitcoin. Consequently, the analyst noted that Ethereum\u2019s price performance against Bitcoin is now around the 2022 low of 0.04922.\n\nAccording to Van De Poppe, the approval of the long-awaited spot Bitcoin ETFs could lead to the creation of another liquidation candle on ETH/BTC to eventually take the liquidity around the 2022 low. This would eventually lead to a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence.\n\nAs a result, the ETH/BTC pair would be propelled to a target just above 0.12 by the rotation, signifying an increase of more than 100%. Notably, the last time ETH reached this level on the ETH/BTC pair was during the crypto\u2019s first major bull run in 2018.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there. If an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we\u2019ll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nETH bulls regain control of price | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nThe Rotation Game Has Started\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs have been approved by the SEC on Wednesday, causing the price of Bitcoin to spike to $48,600, its highest point since April 2022. However, the price of Bitcoin has stalled and is now trading at $45,839, about where it was when the news of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs came out.\n\nAt the same time, Ethereum rose over $2,500 to reach $2,600, its highest point since April 2022. Ethereum has maintained this gain to outperform Bitcoin and is trading at $2,618 at the time of writing.\n\nAccording to another post on social media by Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe price action since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs suggests that the rotation is already happening on the ETH/BTC pair.\n\n\u201cThe rotation game is happening already,\u201d he stated, adding a $3,500 price target for ETH.\n\nThe rotation game is happening already. A massive weekly bullish divergence on the $ETH / $BTC pair suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a strong run on Ethereum, and altcoins. We\u2019re at January 2016, good times ahead.

        "content": "The long-awaited arrival of a Bitcoin spot ETF in the US has sparked a surge in cryptocurrency prices, with Ethereum Classic leading the charge among altcoins.\n\nAfter languishing around $20 for months, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has skyrocketed over 50% in the past seven days, currently hovering around $29.45 and just a breath away from reclaiming the $30 mark.\n\nThis impressive rally comes amidst a broader market upswing triggered by the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) historic approval of the Bitcoin Trust ETF on January 10th, 2024.\n\nETC price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko\n\nEthereum Classic Surge: A Combination Of Factors\n\nETF-fueled optimism: The approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF signifies increased institutional interest in the crypto market, a development that traditionally benefits the entire ecosystem, including altcoins like ETC. This optimism is reflected in the strong performance of other major cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum witnessing a 10% climb and briefly hitting a 20-month high above $2,600.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s unique appeal: Compared to its Ethereum counterpart, Ethereum Classic boasts a smaller market cap and lower transaction fees, potentially making it a more attractive option for traders seeking higher returns and cheaper on-chain activity. Its recent network upgrades have also bolstered confidence in its technological capabilities.\n\nSpillover effect and community hype: The Bitcoin ETF approval has undoubtedly fueled a general sense of bullishness across the crypto landscape, influencing investor sentiment towards altcoins with perceived potential. Additionally, the strong community support and active development around Ethereum Classic further contribute to its upward momentum.\n\nETC market cap currently at $4.248 billion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nETC Trading Volume Soars\n\nThe surge isn\u2019t just limited to price. Ethereum Classic\u2019s trading volume has also soared by a staggering 276% in the past 24 hours, reaching a volume of $1.8 billion.\n\nThis increase in trading activity further validates the market\u2019s interest in Ethereum Classic and potentially indicates continued upward pressure on its price.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to remember that the crypto market remains highly volatile. While the Bitcoin spot ETF approval and Ethereum Classic\u2019s recent performance are positive indicators, investors should conduct thorough research and consider both the potential benefits and risks before making any investment decisions.\n\nWith its strong community, technological advancements, and now, the tailwinds of the Bitcoin ETF approval, Ethereum Classic has positioned itself as a frontrunner in the current altcoin rally.\n\nWhether it can sustain its momentum and break through the $30 barrier remains to be seen, but its recent performance signals a renewed level of enthusiasm for this resilient blockchain project.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "ETHBTC Ratio Skyrockets After BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Supports Ethereum ETF - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nThe market has already observed a rise in ETH price following the SEC\u2019s green light for a spot Bitcoin ETF, leading analysts to predict a similar approval for an Ethereum ETF. Nonetheless, the SEC\u2019s perspective of Bitcoin as a \u2018non-security commodity\u2019 was a key factor in approving Bitcoin ETFs, a situation that might differ for Ethereum. However, with the backing of BlackRock\u2019s CEO for an Ethereum ETF, there\u2019s a possibility that the SEC\u2019s view on Ethereum as either a security or a commodity could change, following market sentiment.\n\nSupport From Larry Fink Boosts ETH Price\n\nLarry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (BLK), backed the notion of an ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) a day after the much-anticipated bitcoin (BTC) ETF went live. \u201cI see value in having an Ethereum ETF,\u201d Fink said in an interview with CNBC on Friday. \u201cThese are just stepping stones towards tokenization and I really do believe this is where we\u2019re going to be going.\u201d\n\nTokenization refers to the process of representing assets, whether they are physical or digital, as tokens on a blockchain. Fink is of the opinion that tokenization has the potential to address issues associated with money laundering and various forms of corruption.\n\nThe $9 trillion asset management firm appears to be considering the listing of a similar product for Ethereum\u2019s native token, aligning with its progressive move towards tokenization. Additionally, Fink mentioned that he views cryptocurrency not as a currency, but rather as an asset class. He specifically highlighted bitcoin, describing it as \u201can asset class that protects you\u201d in the face of geopolitical risks.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s no different than what gold represented over thousands of years. Unlike gold, we\u2019re almost at the ceiling of the amount of bitcoin that can be created.\u201d\n\nFollowing support from BlackRock, the ETHBTC ratio skyrocketed toward its October high, currently trading at 0.06039.\n\nSEC\u2019s Potential View On Ethereum ETF\n\nThe SEC has postponed its decision on an Ethereum ETF, requiring over 45 days to review a rule change proposal that would enable Grayscale to transform its Ethereum trust into a spot Ethereum ETF. The extended deadline is now set for January 25, 2024. Additionally, the SEC has delayed its decision on the Ethereum ETF proposed by crypto asset management firm Hashdex, as revealed in a separate document.\n\nYet, there\u2019s an ongoing debate over whether Ethereum should be classified as a security or a commodity for ETF approval purposes. The SEC\u2019s previous approval of Ethereum futures ETFs in October signaled an implicit recognition of ether, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, as a commodity, as per a Bloomberg analyst.\n\nThe October 2023 approval of ether futures ETFs and recent spot Bitcoin ETF launch suggests that we can expect further applications for spot Ethereum ETFs, potentially as early as later this year. However, if the SEC were to classify ether as a security, it is quite likely that legal challenges would arise concerning this designation."

        "title": "Here Are Five Ethereum Rivals Under $5 Set for Breakouts in 2024 - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Many tokens under $5 have experienced significant growth in functionality and adoption, setting the stage to potentially rival Ethereum\u2019s longstanding position as the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nETH may have become expensive and out of reach for many. The Crypto Basic examines more affordable coins believed to be poised for a significant uptrend in the emerging bull market of 2024.\n\nXRP\n\nThe fourth-largest altcoin, XRP, is the leading asset below $5, widely expected to engineer a significant uptrend in the coming bull season.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nXRP\u2019s blockchain XRP Ledger (XRPL) boasts a suite of utilities for both the crypto and traditional financial landscape. XRPL has garnered support from enterprise companies with over a decade of error-free operation.\n\nDevelopers utilize XRPL to pioneer blockchain projects and applications across various use cases. This includes online gaming, asset tokenization, custody, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe Crypto Basic has recently uncovered that over 1,500 projects are operating on XRPL. Moreover, Japan\u2019s financial giant SBI commenced using XRP to facilitate cross-border payment among Asian countries in September 2023.\n\nConsidering XRP\u2019s growing prominence within the financial landscape, experts foresee the potential for XRP to reach double-digit or even triple-digit valuations in the coming years.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAt press time, XRP trades at $0.5956, with a 3% gain over the past week.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nThe Charles Hoskinson-led $20 billion valued crypto Cardano (ADA) is another low-priced token with potential in the unfolding bull market. Like XRP, ADA is among the top ten most valuable tokens, trailing Ethereum.\n\nCardano serves various practical purposes, with agricultural companies utilizing it to trace fresh produce from cultivation to consumption.\n\nAdditionally, the platform facilitates storing educational credentials in a tamper-proof manner and empowers retailers to combat counterfeit goods effectively.\n\nWhile ADA trades at $0.5796, influential figures in the community anticipate the asset reaching $10 in this market cycle. The basis for this optimistic target lies in ADA\u2019s previous performance, having reached $3 in the last bull cycle without smart contracts or functional DEXs.\n\nWith the current presence of various utilities on Cardano, community members set their sights on the $10 mark.\n\nPolygon (MATIC)\n\nPolygon\u2019s MATIC token is an eight-billion-dollar crypto project with a market value of around $0.9144. The Polygon network has evolved into a robust Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum.\n\nIt addresses challenges such as high gas fees and network congestion. Reportedly, it has a capacity of processing 65,000 transactions per second on a single side chain, with a block confirmation time of less than two seconds.\n\nNotably, Polygon wields the backing of established players in the crypto market, such as Binance and Coinbase.\n\nIn 2024, several factors, particularly its scaling capabilities, are poised to drive explosive growth for Polygon. Besides, its team disclosed a new road map last year, which includes rebranding MATIC to POL token.\n\nTron (TRX)\n\nTron (TRX) ranks as the 12th most prominent crypto, with a valuation exceeding $9.4 billion. The Tron blockchain boasts diverse applications featuring smart contracts and stablecoins.\n\nAccording to Defillama data, Tron stands as the second-largest network for facilitating stablecoin transactions, trailing only Ethereum.\n\nNote that the market share of stablecoin is $133.84 billion at the time of reporting. Tron commands a substantial 37.46% share in this domain, while the BNB Chain, the subsequent contender, holds a smaller share at 3.2%.\n\nNotably, Tron\u2019s native asset, TRX, trades at $0.1073 at the time of writing.\n\nAlgorand (ALGO)\n\nAlso, Algorand has risen as a blockchain platform that delivers security, scalability, and decentralization. The emphasis on speed and efficiency has become a defining characteristic of Algorand, making it an attractive choice for developers.\n\nAccording to reports, the Algorand mainnet demonstrated its capability to process nearly 1 million daily transactions as of three years ago. ALGO trades at $0.1997, ranking among the top 50 most valuable cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nNuggetRush presale in progress.\n\n$2,130 and $2,500 are two key price levels for Ethereum\n\nSolana developers ranged between $2,500 and $3,000, on average, every month in 2023.\n\nCryptocurrency prices are rising as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and NuggetRush (NUGX) gain momentum. An analyst predicts that Ethereum could reach new highs.\n\nMeanwhile, the Solana and NuggetRush ecosystems are expanding due to their features.\n\nExploring NuggetRush\n\nNUGX is a cryptocurrency token associated with a play-to-earn game, NuggetRush.\n\nIn the game, users can earn rewards like cash and gold. The project aims to support artisanal miners in developing countries.\n\nThe NuggetRush ecosystem allows players to own mining facilities, build character NFTs, stake them to earn returns, and access other NFT rewards. Players can also stake NUGX.\n\nYou might also like: Analyst highlights key signal for XRP; NuggetRush and Beam start strongly in 2024\n\nAdditionally, NuggetRush does not charge taxes on token sales, which keeps transaction fees low for investors.\n\nThe NUGX token is currently in the fourth phase of its presale.\n\nAnalysts have observed the token price increase from $0.010 to $0.015, a 50% rise.\n\nSome forecast further price appreciation to $0.020.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nCryptocurrency analyst Crypto Tony believes Ethereum is poised for a bullish run if it can maintain its price above the $2,130 support level.\n\nIf Ethereum successfully crosses the $2,500 resistance level, the bullish momentum could intensify, further boosting positive sentiment in the Ethereum market.\n\nYou might also like: Celsius pays over $90m to Coinbase and FalconX via unstaked Ethereum\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading above $2,300.\n\nIn the past week, its price has fluctuated between $2,184.62 and $2,434.45.\n\nSolana ecosystem expanding\n\nA recent study by the Solana Foundation found that its has over 2,500 monthly active developers.\n\nIn addition, developer retention on Solana has increased by 50% over the past three months.\n\nThis growth is likely due to the increasing activity on Solana and rising SOL prices.\n\nIn December, Solana briefly surpassed BNB to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nAt the time, its price reached a yearly high of $125.\n\nHowever, SOL has retraced.\n\nAs of Jan. 9, it was the fifth-largest project by market capitalization.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nCurrently, Ethereum, Solana, and NuggetRush are bullish. NuggetRush is launching a new gaming platform that makes NUGX central.

        "content": "Best Crypto to Buy Today January 11 \u2013 Ethereum Classic, SUI, Mantle\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC), with its price surge of over 50% for the past 4 days, is leading the charge and establishing itself as one of the best cryptos to buy today against the backdrop of the SEC\u2019s nod to Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSUI Network and Mantle are also seeing notable gains, while fresh crypto presale opportunities like Bitcoin Minetrix and Sponge V2 Token are also catching the eye of market watchers.\n\nBest Crypto to Buy Now in the News\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) token has surged over 50% over the past few days, rising as one of the top performers amid recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThis impressive rally has outpaced the gains seen for Bitcoin and Ethereum during the same timeframe.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #EthereumClassic has blasted off following the #BitcoinETF announcement, reaching above $26 for the first time since October, 2022. Trading volume has surged, indicating major trader interest. However, $ETC sentiment still appears neutral for now. https://t.co/LhebnauCQX pic.twitter.com/wEf3ujmqH6 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 11, 2024\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s rise comes after the SEC\u2019s approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe boom has also coincided with a 403.44% explosion in ETC\u2019s trading volume, signaling heightened market interest.\n\nBeyond Ethereum Classic, SUI Network\u2019s token has climbed 28% to reach $1.0788 as of writing.\n\nSUI\u2019s price has been volatile over the past week, with an overall upward trend. Market indicators show strong support levels for SUI, with predictions of continued volatility in the short term.\n\nRecent SUI developments like the Karrier One partnership to integrate telecom services with web3 technology, along with BitMateX launching the SUI public chain, highlight its growing presence across the tech industry.\n\nScaling to new levels, Mantle (MNT) registered an all-time high of $0.8508 earlier today.\n\nSince then, the MNT price has retraced slightly to the current level of $0.8102, though it remains up 4.53% so far today.\n\nWith its daily trading volume approaching $550 million and a market cap of approximately $2.53 billion, Mantle has a positive forecast assisted by the surging interest in Ethereum and Layer 2 protocols.\n\nAs established cryptos like ETC, SUI, and MNT mark their territory, presales for newer cryptos like Bitcoin Minetrix and Sponge V2 Token also offer opportunities for early adopters.\n\nThese up-and-coming crypto ventures are generating interest given their potential in the evolving crypto space.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s impressive performance, the dynamic price action of SUI, and Mantle crossing new milestones are capturing investor and trader attention today.\n\nAlong with rising interest in new presale opportunities, these developments are shaping the narrative around the best crypto to buy today.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) Price Shows Potential for Further Climb\n\nAfter posting strong gains for the past few days, Ethereum Classic (ETC) saw its price surge to new multi-year highs earlier today amidst heavy trading volumes.\n\nWith the ETC price challenging key resistance levels, technical indicators suggest the bullish momentum may continue in the days ahead.\n\nThe 20-day EMA for the ETC price currently stands at $22.13, trading above the 50-day EMA of $20.93.\n\nThis bullish alignment is viewed as a strongly bullish signal by technicians, signaling improving momentum in the ETC price.\n\nThe RSI jumped to 76.40, up from yesterday\u2019s 70.92 reading. This shows the ETC price is in overbought territory, but still has room to climb before becoming extremely overheated.\n\nThe MACD histogram rose to 0.64, building on yesterday\u2019s 0.21 value. This indicates a building bullish sentiment that could propel the ETC price higher.\n\nWith the ETC price up 10.94% so far today and trading at $29.30, it is challenging multiple layers of resistance at $26.54 to $27.24, $28.93 to $29.48, and $30.36 to $30.95.\n\nIn particular, watch for a decisive breakout above the $28.93 to $29.48 zone, which aligns with the Fib 0.236 level at $29.17. That could signal a sustained move above the key $30 level.\n\nOn the downside, initial support lies at $22.42 to $23.32. However, given today\u2019s strength, the ETC price may find support at $26.54 to $27.24, near the Fib 0.382 level of $27.23, on any pullbacks.\n\nWith ETC shrugging off overbought conditions, the technical picture remains strongly bullish.\n\nA push above $30 could open the door for further gains, while dips remain buying opportunities. Traders may look to ride the upward momentum while managing risk accordingly.\n\nSui Network (SUI) Price Surges Over 32%: Technical Analysis Points to Bullish Breakout\n\nThe SUI price has seen a dramatic surge in the past 24 hours, with the token rallying over 32% to currently trade around $1.1189.\n\nThis marks a decisive breakout for Sui Network after two weeks of rangebound consolidation between $0.7562 and $0.9422.\n\nThe technical indicators reflect this renewed bullish momentum, with the 20-day EMA at $0.8348 remaining above the 50-day EMA of $0.7394 \u2013 maintaining the bullish alignment that has been in place despite recent consolidation.\n\nThe RSI has also spiked to overbought territory at 70.57, surging from yesterday\u2019s 55.42 reading. This indicates the growing upside momentum behind the SUI price.\n\nMost notably, the MACD histogram has formed a bullish crossover, rising to 0.0097 compared to yesterday\u2019s -0.0075 value.\n\nThis occurrence shows shifting sentiment and further upside potential for the SUI price.\n\nWith its breakout, Sui Network now faces multiple layers of overhead resistance between $1.0611 and $1.2449 as it looks to sustain gains above the psychological $1 mark.\n\nImmediate support lies at the 20-day EMA of $0.8348 and the Fib 0.236 level of $0.8112.\n\nAs long as Sui Network can close today\u2019s trading session above the breakout point of $0.9081, this former resistance would flip to support and give bulls more confidence moving forward.\n\nHowever, failure to hold these levels could lead to a pullback towards the 20-day EMA.\n\nTraders should watch upcoming price action closely to see if Sui Network can continue its uptrend.\n\nPushing through the layered resistance would expose the blue sky upside, while rejection could lead to a rotation lower.\n\nAdhering to defined risk management will remain key amidst the volatility.\n\nMNT Price Hits All-Time High and Retraces: Technical Analysis for Potential Opportunities\n\nAfter reaching a new all-time high of $0.8508 earlier today, the MNT price has retraced to current levels of $0.7990 but remains up 3.20% so far today.\n\nWith the price in overbought RSI territory, waiting for a potential pullback and base formation with stability could be prudent before considering fresh positions.\n\nThe MNT price continues trending above its 20-day EMA of $0.6470 and 50-day EMA of $0.5952.\n\nThe widening gap between these short and long-term moving averages paints a bullish picture.\n\nHowever, the overextended 100-day EMA at $0.5462 highlights the potential for mean reversion.\n\nAt 75.03, the RSI is already in overbought territory above 70. This signals that rally exhaustion is likely forthcoming.\n\nThe expanding positive MACD histogram now reads 0.0137, up from 0.0066 yesterday, reflecting accelerating bullish momentum that may prove unsustainable.\n\nWith the MNT price consolidating below its new all-time high, traders are eyeing whether this marks a top or temporary pause before continuation.\n\nCrucial resistance exists around $0.8508, while initial support holds at the Fib 0.236 level of $0.7879. A break below the Fib 0.382 level at $0.7491 could open the door for a steeper pullback.\n\nMonitoring price action around these technical levels may offer clues regarding MNT\u2019s next directional move. While the uptrend remains intact above the 20 and 50-day EMA dynamic support, overextended indicators warrant caution.\n\nWith market leaders topping new highs, the search is on for promising upstarts before they hit exchanges. Presales for Bitcoin Minetrix and Sponge V2 Token give forward-looking investors a chance to buy early.\n\nTheir pioneering advancements could make them smart additions alongside stalwarts like ETC, SUI, and MNT.\n\nExploring New Horizons: Bitcoin Alternatives Worth Checking Out\n\n\n\nAs 2024 unfolds, the focus within the cryptocurrency market is broadening with investors expanding beyond Bitcoin, eager to uncover cryptocurrencies that could spearhead the next surge in industry growth.\n\nThese up-and-coming options are becoming popular as potential Bitcoin alternatives, presenting new opportunities for investors looking to broaden their portfolios.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix and Sponge V2 Token are at the forefront of this trend.\n\nThese cryptocurrencies are quickly becoming popular among those searching for the best crypto to buy today.\n\nTheir potential as Bitcoin alternatives is generating interest from forward-thinking investors.\n\nWhile Bitcoin continues to play a key role in the cryptocurrency domain, the interest in new, promising options is undeniable.\n\nFor investors seeking to broaden their portfolios, exploring these new cryptocurrencies represents a strategic move towards growth and diversification.\n\nSimplify Mining, Amplify Profits: Bitcoin Minetrix Is One of the Best Crypto to Buy Today\n\nThe ongoing presale for Bitcoin Minetrix has raised over $8.2 million so far as cryptocurrency enthusiasts invest in the project\u2019s tokens ahead of its full launch.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix looks to improve cloud mining through its stake-to-mine technology that allows token holders to passively earn Bitcoin without expensive hardware or technical expertise.\n\nStage 19 of #BitcoinMinetrix has begun! \ud83d\ude80 What improvements or innovations would you like to see in the field of #Bitcoin mining? \ud83d\udca1 pic.twitter.com/O3Je0vfLGF \u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) January 11, 2024\n\nThe presale\u2019s surging popularity signals strong confidence in Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nThe project streamlines cloud mining through an intuitive platform designed for mainstream accessibility.\n\nBy staking BTXMTX tokens, users gain computing power to mine Bitcoin on their behalf. This reduces the typical challenges of mining\u2019s complexity and high costs.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix will utilize a dual revenue model, rewarding stakes with up to 79% APY along with a share of the mining profits.\n\nThis unique system intends to balance tokenomics, creating sustainable demand for BTXMTX.\n\nAs the presale enters its stage 19, BTXMTX is priced at $0.0126, up 10% from the previous round.\n\nThe presale\u2019s tiered pricing structure has driven early participation, evidenced by the rapid influx of investments.\n\nWith the presale\u2019s 42.5% token allocation nearly sold out, investors are entering the last leg to acquire BTXMTX before the upcoming listing.\n\nThe project\u2019s pioneering mining solution and committed community point toward an expected upswing in price post-launch.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix offers an easy entry point into crypto mining\u2019s profits without the typical barriers, making it one of the best cryptos to buy today.\n\nAs the presale heads toward its close, investors are jumping on the opportunity to acquire BTXMTX before market availability tightens.\n\nThe project\u2019s fresh approach to simplifying mining continues to gain traction across the crypto space.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Now\n\nStaking and Gaming Features Set Sponge V2 Apart as the Best Crypto to Buy Today\n\nThe ongoing presale of the Sponge V2 token has been causing quite a stir in the cryptocurrency community.\n\nSponge V2 is the successor to Sponge V1, a meme coin that became wildly popular in 2023 when it achieved a market cap of over $100 million during the crypto bear market.\n\nSponge V2 is taking a one-of-a-kind approach with its presale by requiring interested investors to stake existing Sponge V1 tokens to receive Sponge V2 tokens.\n\nThis stake-to-bridge method aims to encourage long-term commitment to the project and build a stable investor base leading up to the official launch.\n\nAnother exciting feature being introduced with Sponge V2 is a play-to-earn game, where users can earn additional tokens for gameplay.\n\nThis represents a pivot beyond being just another meme coin, as it adds real utility and value to the token.\n\nApproximately 8% of the total 150 billion token supply will be set aside for play-to-earn rewards.\n\nThe presale phase offers investors the chance to get in early before Sponge V2 is listed on major crypto exchanges.\n\nSponge V2 will utilize the Ethereum blockchain and follow the ERC-20 standard, ensuring broad compatibility with crypto wallets and decentralized apps.\n\nThis allows it to leverage the security and interoperability of the Ethereum network.\n\nWith its novel staking model and integrated gaming features, Sponge V2 is pushing the boundaries of meme coins, positioning itself as one of the most forward-thinking crypto investments and potentially the best crypto to buy today.\n\nThe countdown is on for its full launch, where the crypto community will see if this token can deliver on its lofty potential to provide real utility and value beyond being just another meme coin fad.\n\nVisit Sponge V2 NowDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

With this achievement comes the responsibility to continue building momentum and delivering value to our users and developers.\u201d\n\nProjects on Manta Pacific Continue to Gain Traction\n\nLi also highlighted the remarkable progress of projects within the Manta Pacific ecosystem, such as LayerBank, Shoebill, QuickSwap, and Aperture Finance.\n\nThese projects have seen their STONE and wUSDM lending pools surpass the $500 million supply mark.\n\nManta Network aims to encourage more DeFi projects to deploy on Manta Pacific, enabling them to experience similar levels of success.\n\nFurthermore, the Manta Pacific roadmap includes the implementation of zkEVM via Polygon CDK and a continuous effort to reduce gas fees through its integration with Celestia\u2019s modular data availability.\n\n\u201cThis makes Manta Pacific a preferable choice for projects that want to offer great experiences to their users and we are already seeing an influx of projects wanting to deploy immediately.\u201d\n\nAs reported, Ethereum-based layer 2 network Arbitrum now has a market share of 49.17% among layer 2 networks, far surpassing number two on the list, Optimism Mainnet, with its 28.85% market share."

        "content": "In a recent development, seasoned trader Peter Brandt has reevaluated his stance on Ethereum (ETH) after considering the market implications of a Bitcoin (BTC) ETF approval.\n\nBrandt disclosed his change of stance in a recent post on X, as ETH recaptures $2,600. The veteran analyst noted that he is known for his \u201cstrong opinions, weakly held\u201d approach, stressing the importance of adapting trading strategies based on changing market realities.\n\nBrandt\u2019s Initial Rising Wedge Prediction\n\nBrandt, who initially subscribed to the belief of a substantial rising wedge formation in Ethereum, now suggests a deviation from this anticipated pattern. Recall that he had predicted that ETH could drop to $650, as previously reported by The Crypto Basic.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, the veteran trader had believed that Ethereum would be following a rising wedge pattern. A rising wedge typically features two converging trendlines, one connecting higher highs and another connecting higher lows. It signals a potential bearish reversal in the market.\n\nThis pattern suggests that while the price of the crypto asset is making higher highs and higher lows, the trading range is narrowing. Brandt held the view that Ethereum was taking this path despite the sustained bullish sentiments from other market watchers.\n\nA Renewed Outlook\n\nHowever, in his latest analysis, he admitted the inaccuracy in his assertion, stressing that the asset could be forming a running wedge instead.\n\nThe running wedge pattern usually features a corrective phase that doesn\u2019t fully retrace to the origin of the preceding trend but rather continues the trend at a slower pace.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThis adjustment is prompted by Brandt\u2019s consideration of the Darvas box tool. The Darvas box methodology, pioneered by Nicolas Darvas, involves delineating price ranges and identifying potential breakout signals.\n\nSpeaking on Ethereum, Brandt implied that the asset\u2019s price movement might align with the principles of the Darvas box, leading to a running wedge pattern rather than the initially envisioned rising wedge.\n\nEthereum Shows Resilience\n\nThe shift in Brandt\u2019s perspective coincides with the broader market discussion surrounding the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. The analyst called attention to the \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d mantra that prevails in trading circles.\n\nWith this sentiment, traders act on speculative information leading up to an event, only to witness market reversals when the actual news materializes.\n\nBrandt anticipated this trend, expecting a \u201cblow off top\u201d in the market following a BTC ETF approval. This would mean a potential sharp peak followed by a significant correction.\n\nHowever, following the approval of all 11 spot BTC ETFs, the market has not followed the expected trajectory. Notably, BTC soared to $48,969 yesterday before facing a drop. In addition, ETH hit a high of $2,689. Ethereum has retained most of its gains, currently trading for $2,650.\n\nThis resilience displayed by the second-largest asset has prompted Brandt\u2019s recent change in price outlook. Nonetheless, Ethereum\u2019s trade volume has slumped 35.8% over the last 24 hours to $19,566,470,439, but the token remains the third largest in volume, only below USDT and BTC."

        "content": "Crypto Expert Anthony Sassano has provided a bullish narrative for the Ethereum ecosystem. Based on this, he believes that Ethereum could hit a new all-time high (ATH) this year. The analyst also went as far as predicting what price level ETH could hit in particular.\n\nETH Could Rise To As High As $10,000 This Year\n\nSassano stated that ETH could hit $10,000 if the Ethereum Spot ETF hype were to get \u201cahead of itself.\u201d These ETFs are believed to be next in line for an approval order by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That could explain why the crypto expert has handpicked them as the catalyst for this massive increase in ETH\u2019s price.\n\nMeanwhile, even if the $10,000 price level isn\u2019t attained, Sassano believes that ETH could still rise to as high as $6,000 before the year runs out. Before making these price predictions, he had explained why he was so bullish on the Ethereum ecosystem. According to him, Ethereum is going to gain a lot of interest from institutions because of the yield it affords them.\n\nEthereum, being a proof-of-stake network, provides an opportunity for investors to stake their ETH tokens and earn some rewards in return. This institutional interest in Ethereum is going to be further driven by the launch of Ethereum Spot ETFs, Sassano opined. He further suggested these yields will also give Ethereum an edge over Bitcoin.\n\nInterestingly, crypto analyst Altcoin Daily had before now stated that ETH hitting $10,000 was \u201cprogrammed.\u201d He alluded to the higher yields on the network as one of the reasons for his assertion. However, unlike Sassano, Altcoin Daily didn\u2019t suggest a timeline for when the crypto token will hit this price level.\n\nETH price crosses $2,600 resistance | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nIs The Market\u2019s Attention Turning To Ethereum?\n\nETH rallied following the SEC\u2019s approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, while Bitcoin didn\u2019t see much action. That could suggest that the market was already turning its attention to the Ethereum Spot ETFs. It also shows that the Bitcoin market was likely already priced in before the approval came in.\n\nIf that is the case, the second-largest crypto token by market cap could begin to post some major gains ahead of a potential approval of the Ethereum ETFs in May. This would be something similar to what happened with Bitcoin, which resurged on the back of rumors involving the Spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at around $2,580, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image from Cointribune, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Gary Gensler, the Chair of the US Securities and Exchange (SEC), issued cautionary statements to the crypto sector, raising uncertainty about the possibility of the Ether obtaining approval for an ETF similar to Bitcoin.\n\nBut this has not stopped Ether from surging, which has reached its highest point since May 2022. Perhaps unexpectedly, the approval of 11 Bitcoin ETF proposals was also followed by the growth of Ethereum-based projects.\n\nEthereum-Based Projects Shine\n\nAccording to Santiment\u2019s latest analysis, projects built on the Ethereum platform experienced significant growth in market capitalization as the SEC approved the trading in Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, ending over a decade of rejections.\n\n\u201cEthereum-based projects were some of the bigger beneficiaries in market cap growth following the SEC\u2019s 11 ETF approvals yesterday.\u201d\n\nEther jumped by 5% as it climbed to $2,670, a level not seen since the last 20 months.\n\nBesides Ether, ENS \u2013 the native token of Ethereum Name Service that functions as a decentralized naming system built on Ethereum \u2013 increased by nearly 25% following the SEC\u2019s decision on January 10th. The latest price action pushed its weekly gains to over 86%. ENS was currently trading at $25.96.\n\nThe soaring Ethereum-based projects right after the fact indicated increased optimism in the ecosystem despite a lack of clarity in terms of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nDecisions on approval for spot Ether ETFs are expected from the agency starting in May. Heavyweights such as BlackRock, Invesco, Ark, VanEck, and Grayscale are among those awaiting approval.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which has been distinctly categorized as a commodity, the classification for Ethereum is more complicated, and the approval for an Ether ETF is considered \u201cnot as straightforward\u201d as it was for Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, Steve McClurg, co-founder and chief investment officer of Valkyrie Funds, recently said that the current market conditions are favorable for such an offering.\n\nEthereum\u2019s GitHub Momentum\n\nParticipants in the Ethereum ecosystem are showing signs of resilience. According to Santiment, Ethereum was one of the several ERC:20 crypto assets that have been witnessing notable GitHub activity over the past 30 days. It was ranked in the third spot in terms of development activity behind Status and Chainlink, which captured the first and the second positions, respectively.\n\nExamining GitHub activity proves to be a compelling metric when assessing ICOs and crypto projects. Developers invest their valuable time, a resource with a significant cost, in a particular project.\n\nThis commitment from numerous developers on the Ethereum ecosystem, ahead of a potential spot in Ether ETF, can indicate confidence among developers in the project\u2019s potential success."

Discover SCENE\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of this week\u2019s historic approval and listing of 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs, excitement has spread to the Ethereum community that a spot ETH ETF could now be imminent.\n\nBut for those concerned about too much celebration in one week, worry not: Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler is always there to rain on the parade.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC this morning, Gensler gave very little encouragement when asked if a spot Ethereum ETF is poised to gain SEC approval any time soon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI look at what we did this week as cabin to one non-security commodity called Bitcoin,\u201d Gensler said. \u201cLike we\u2019ve had gold spot exchange-traded products, and silver spot exchange-traded products approved in the past, this is cabin just to that one non-security commodity token.\u201d\n\nGensler COPING AND SEETHING\n\nWatch:\n\n(RT to share)\n\nShout out Joe from CNBC for asking these pic.twitter.com/N3Tn6pTuXo \u2014 Cryptik1.eth |\ud83d\udef8 (@Cryptik1E) January 12, 2024\n\nGensler refused to say anything further about an Ethereum ETF specifically. But his word choice was telling: By emphasizing his view of Bitcoin as a commodity, the SEC chair was likely attempting to draw an implicit line between Bitcoin\u2019s unchallenged status as a commodity, and the potential status of all other cryptocurrencies\u2014including Ethereum\u2014as securities.\n\nFor years, Gensler has repeatedly maintained that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency he views as certainly being a commodity, meaning one therefore outside the SEC\u2019s purview.\n\nWhile the SEC has yet to make any official pronouncements about Ethereum\u2019s security status, the agency has previously signaled in legal filings that it views all Ethereum transactions as falling under its jurisdiction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf the SEC were to view Ethereum as a security, that would likely make the regulator even more hostile to a spot Ethereum ETF than it was to a Bitcoin ETF, which it previously rejected for years on end before essentially being forced to do so by a federal appeals court.\n\nThat same court decision, though, might also force the SEC to approve a spot Ethereum ETF. As Gensler himself noted this week in his statement regarding the Bitcoin ETF approval, the \u201ccircumstances\u201d surrounding crypto ETFs \u201chave changed\u201d due to legal judgments.\n\nThe SEC was ordered to review Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF application in October because, the judges found, it could not arbitrarily deny a spot Bitcoin ETF after approving a Bitcoin futures ETF application. The SEC already approved an Ethereum futures ETF that same month, potentially setting up a parallel legal scenario.\n\nFutures ETFs track the price of derivatives contracts, which themselves grant the buyer the ability to buy or sell Bitcoin at a later date. No Bitcoin is actually bought and sold when futures ETFs are bought and sold. Spot ETFs are different; their issuers actually buy and store Bitcoin on behalf of clients.\n\nEthereum is up big this week on excitement spurred by the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, with hopes that a spot Ethereum ETF could be up next. The token approached $2.700 this morning for the first time since April 2022 after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC that he\u2019s all in on an Ethereum ETF, and considers this week\u2019s events \u201cjust the beginning.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "The altcoin market has witnessed significant growth in the last 24 hours.\n\nETC and ENS have seen their values rise by double digits.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is experiencing a significant surge following the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This long-awaited decision has led to a widespread rally in the values of several assets.\n\nEthereum-linked tokens Ethereum Classic [ETC] and Ethereum Name Service [ENS] have led the charge in this rally, rising to their highest price levels in over 12 months.\n\nETC has seen its price jump by over 47% in the past 24 hours, while ENS has climbed by 37%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nBoth assets have also seen a spike in trading volume in the past 24 hours. ENS\u2019s trading volume totaled $504 million during that period, rising by 200%.\n\nRegarding ETC, its trading volume has risen by over 250%, totaling $2.16 billion, its highest since September 2022, AMBCrypto found.\n\nThe price rally comes at a price\n\nAt press time, ETC traded at $31.42. The last time the coin traded at this high was in September 2022, per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nIts price movements assessed on a weekly chart showed a persistent accumulation pattern among traders. This had occurred despite the downtrend in ETC price since the year began prior to the recent rally.\n\nIts key momentum indicators were spotted at overbought levels at press time. For example, the coin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 72.75, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 75.15. At these values, these indicators suggested that buying momentum exceeded coin sell-offs.\n\nFurther, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was spotted in an uptrend at 0.18, showing a steady inflow of liquidity into the ETC market.\n\nHowever, the unexpected price rally resulted in increased price volatility. The coin\u2019s price traded significantly above the upper band of the Bollinger Bands indicator at press time. When this happens, the market is deemed to be overheated, and a retracement usually follows.\n\nENS follows suit\n\nAlso witnessing a double-digit price rally in the past 24 hours, the ENS market was significantly volatile at press time. As its price rose, the gap between the upper and lower bands of its Bollinger Bands indicator widened.\n\nWhen the gap between the upper and lower bands of the Bollinger Bands increases, it\u2019s generally considered a sign of increased volatility.\n\nConfirming that ENS\u2019 price was prone to swings, its Average True (ATR) range initiated an uptrend. At press time, this indicator returned a value of 2.67.\n\nThis indicator measures market volatility by calculating the average range between high and low prices over a specified number of periods. When it rises, there is volatility in the market."

        "content": "Fri 12 Jan 2024 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nBitcoin, the patriarch of digital currencies, appears to be losing its luster in favor of its younger sibling, Ethereum. This surprising dynamic comes in a context where the SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin ETFs has shaken the crypto world, but not exactly in the way expected.\n\nThe Unexpected Effect of the Bitcoin ETFs Approval\n\nThe approval of the Bitcoin ETFs was anticipated to propel BTC to new heights. However, it\u2019s Ethereum that has captured attention, with surprising volatility leading to a large number of liquidations.\n\nTraders, caught in the whirlwind of this volatility, have seen their LONG and SHORT positions implode, revealing the market\u2019s contradictory expectations.\n\nWhile Bitcoin was soaring, Ethereum remained strangely calm, like the sea before a storm. However, this calm has ended with the SEC\u2019s announcement, hinting at a potential ascent for Ethereum and the altcoins of its ecosystem.\n\nThe euphoria over Bitcoin in recent months seems to be finding a response in these recent developments. The market, always in search of the next big thing, is beginning to turn its eyes toward Ethereum, stimulated by speculations and anticipations of a future Ethereum ETFs approval.\n\nEthereum, the New Rising Star?\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s prolonged rise fueled by speculation on ETFs, Ethereum is now positioning itself to take up the torch. If Bitcoin\u2019s history with ETFs is any indication, Ethereum might well follow a similar, or even more spectacular, trajectory as it approaches its own ETF approval.\n\nIn the wake of Ethereum, an entire ecosystem of altcoins is stirring. History has shown us that when Ethereum gains momentum, it often brings a myriad of other cryptos along with it in its rise.\n\nAs the crypto world awaits the next Bitcoin halving, a period of transition is taking place, where speculation on Bitcoin could give way to an alternate season dominated by Ethereum.\n\nThe Future of the Crypto Market\n\nIn this climate of transition, Ethereum is establishing itself as a beacon, guiding investors through the sometimes turbulent waters of the crypto market. Its rise in power could redefine expectations and investment strategies in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nMany anticipate an alternate season with Ethereum at the helm.\n\nThis period could offer unique opportunities for investors looking to diversify beyond Bitcoin.\n\nWhile setting the stage for Ethereum, the future remains uncertain, but promising. Current indicators suggest an exciting period for Ethereum, potentially marked by innovations and breakthroughs that could redefine the crypto landscape.\n\nAs Bitcoin seems to lose some of its preeminence in favor of Ethereum, one question remains: are we witnessing a simple change of guard or a more profound revolution in the world of cryptocurrency? Only time will tell. What is certain is that attention is shifting toward Ethereum, and the ever-unpredictable crypto market is ready to embrace this new era with both enthusiasm and caution. Here are the forecasts for 2024 for the weeks ahead.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has recently expressed keen interest in the possibilities of Ethereum-based Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), hinting at another strategic move toward embracing blockchain technology, in a recent interview with CNBC.\n\n\"I see value in having an Ethereum ETF. As I've said, these are just 'stepping stones' towards tokenization. And I do believe that this is where we are going. We have the technology to tokenize today...This eliminates all corruption by having a tokenized system,\" stated Fink in a recent interview.\n\nThis approach aligns with BlackRock's broader strategy of innovating in the financial sector through technology.\n\nBlackRock's Ethereum ETF filing\n\nIn late 2023, BlackRock took a significant step toward this vision by submitting an S-1 application to the SEC for its spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nThis move underscores BlackRock's commitment to integrating more digital assets into its vast array of financial offerings.\n\nBloomberg analysts have predicted a 70% chance of the Ethereum spot ETF being approved by May.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Steve McClurg, cofounder and chief investment officer at Valkyrie Funds, in his interview with Bloomberg, suggested that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could pave the way for similar products based on other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum and XRP.\n\nBeyond crypto\n\nIn addition to its foray into digital assets, BlackRock, under Fink's leadership, has also been focusing on private market infrastructure, a sector they view as increasingly vital.\n\nThe company's acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion is a testament to this focus.\n\nIn his interview, Fink discussed the importance of co-investing with companies and governments in infrastructure projects.\n\nHe stressed the need for recalibrating power grids and focusing on energy independence and decarbonization.\n\nFink considers these infrastructure investments as long-term trends that will significantly influence how markets evolve, emphasizing their potential for growth and impact."

        "content": "BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently acknowledged the potential of an Ethereum ETF in the United States, a significant development following the successful launch of their Bitcoin ETF. In an interview, Fink highlighted the successful trading debut of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, which amassed a remarkable $1.05 billion in trading volume. This achievement outstripped the first-day volume of the BITO Bitcoin futures ETF in 2021.\n\nFink\u2019s insights into the digital asset market are notable. He equated Bitcoin to an asset class similar to gold, with the added nuance of Bitcoin nearing its maximum supply limit. His perspective solidifies the view of cryptocurrencies as more than transient digital phenomena. The move towards tokenization, as Fink suggests, marks a transformative era in the financial sector.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Strategic Moves\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, signaled its growing interest in crypto by filing for a spot at Ethereum ETF in November. This move came five months after its initial foray into a Bitcoin ETF. The proposed Ethereum ETF, named the iShares Ethereum Trust, continues BlackRock\u2019s partnership with Coinbase Custody, reflecting the firm\u2019s deepening commitment to the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nRegulatory Outlook and Industry Growth\n\nSpeculation is high regarding the SEC\u2019s stance on the Ethereum ETF, with analysts like Bloomberg\u2019s Eric Balchunas estimating a 70% chance of approval by May. The SEC\u2019s decision is eagerly awaited, with the first deadline for an Ark and 21Shares application due May 23. The approval of an Ethereum ETF could signal a significant shift in the regulatory landscape and further mainstream adoption of digital assets.\n\nSince co-founding BlackRock in 1988, Fink has steered the firm to unprecedented heights. Under his leadership, BlackRock has grown into a global powerhouse with trillions under management. His recent comments reflect the firm\u2019s increasing attention to the demands of its clients regarding cryptocurrencies.\n\nRead Also: Grayscale Responds To SEC\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Approval Challenges"

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum noted an 18% rally in the past five days, rising from $2,200 to $2,600.\n\nEthereum namesake tokens rallied, with Ethereum Name Service emerging as the biggest gainer, rising by 40% in a day.\n\nThe altcoin is presently at a 21-month high of $22.68, with price indicators suggesting further room for an increase.\n\nEthereum price has seen considerable growth over the past week thanks to the spot Bitcoin ETF approval. While the market was expecting a decline in the altcoin prices, the opposite happened as other altcoins, including Ethereum namesakes, rallied significantly.\n\nEthereum Name Service banks on ETH rally\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS), which is the namesake of the Ethereum chain, is also a major component of the blockchain. It is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system that converts human-readable Ethereum addresses into machine-readable alphanumeric codes.\n\nThe demand for .ens addresses surged in 2021 and 2022 but fell short of making history during the 2023 bear run.\n\nHowever, the native token ENS recovered this past week, rising by almost 60%, with nearly 40% of the surge coming in the past 24 hours. As Ethereum price shot up to $2,700 during the intra-day trading hours, ENS rallied too, trading at $22.68 at the time of writing.\n\nENS/USD 1-day chart\n\nAlthough a slight correction of 7% was observed in the last few hours, the token is holding strong around the $22.78 support line. The price indicator Relative Strength Index (RSI) is noting a heavily bullish momentum, with the RSI sitting in the overbought zone above 70.0. This suggests that ENS price could increase further, potentially breaching the $24.74 resistance level if the altcoin bounces back fuelled by broader market bullish cues.\n\nHowever, if the $22.78 support line is lost, a fall to $20.44 is likely, falling through, which would invalidate the bullish thesis and result in further decline."

Mantle Network has been built with a modular architecture that combines an optimistic roll-up protocol with an innovative data availability solution.\n\nHow Does Mantle Work?\n\nModular Architecture -\n\nThe Modular blockchain is blockchain which is different from monolithic blockchain. It does execution, consensus, and other functions over multiple specialized chains. The idea of a modular blockchain is that it can specialize in a couple of functions instead of trying to do everything.\n\nConsensus and settlement take place on Layer 1 Ethereum. The sequencer produces blocks on L2.\n\nThe validator nodes collect transactions from users and commit them to Ethereum in the form of a \"compressed block\" which reduces the gas fees and increases throughput.\n\nEigen Layer-\n\nEigenDA (Data Availability), built by EigenLabs, is one core application on EigenLayer, which we have selected for Mantle Network's data availability module. It is a decentralized Ethereum protocol that enables ETH restocking. Restocking enables staked ETH to be used as crypto-economic security for protocols other than Ethereum, in exchange for protocol fees and rewards.\n\nMantle Network Properties-\n\nTransaction per second 500\n\nBlock confirmation time - 10 milliseconds\n\nMNTUSD prices surged more than 35% in the past three days.

In the crypto realm, ETH is the leading Web3 infrastructure \u2014 home of hundreds of other projects and apps.\n\nNevertheless, Larry Fink refused to further comment on a possible Ethereum ETF approval by Gary Gensler and the SEC.\n\nAll things considered, the market should expect the risen narrative to dominate in the coming months if the pattern repeats.

        "content": "The Ethereum price has experienced notable growth in the past week following the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF. Contrary to market expectations of a decline in altcoin prices, there has been a significant rally among various altcoins, including the Ethereum name service. The ENS price too surged by more than 158% in the last 30 days. Let\u2019s take a look at this ENS price prediction article in more detail.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY ENS<\u2014\n\nWhat is Ethereum Name Service (ENS)?\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) functions as a decentralized, open, and expandable naming system operating on the Ethereum blockchain. ENS transforms human-readable Ethereum addresses, such as john.eth, into machine-readable alphanumeric codes commonly used in wallets like Metamask. Additionally, the reverse conversion, linking metadata and machine-readable addresses with human-readable Ethereum addresses, is achievable.\n\nENS aims to enhance accessibility and understanding of the Ethereum-based web for users, mirroring how the Internet\u2019s Domain Name Service (DNS) facilitates Internet accessibility. Similar to DNS, ENS employs a hierarchical naming system with dot-separated domains, where domain owners have complete control over their respective subdomains.\n\nThe launch of ENS included a highly successful retroactive airdrop in November 2021, rewarding users who had registered addresses before the token\u2019s official project launch. However, in February 2022, the platform faced criticism due to controversial tweets, reportedly of a homophobic nature, made by its director of operations.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY ENS<\u2014\n\nHow has the ENS price moved in recent days?\n\nAs of today, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is valued at $21.25, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.14 billion. The market capitalization stands at $650.87 million, and ENS holds a market dominance of 0.04%. Over the last 24 hours, the ENS price has risen by 4.23%.\n\nENS reached its peak price on November 11, 2021, at an all-time high of $83.40, while its lowest price was recorded on October 20, 2023, hitting an all-time low of $6.69. The lowest price since its all-time high was $6.69 (cycle low), and the highest ENS price since the last cycle low was $24.78 (cycle high). Presently, the sentiment for Ethereum Name Service price prediction is bullish, and the Fear & Greed Index indicates a level of 71 (Greed).\n\nThe current circulating supply of ENS is 30.63 million out of a maximum supply of 100.00 million ENS. The annual supply inflation rate is 51.32%, resulting in the creation of 10.39 million ENS in the last year.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY ENS<\u2014\n\nENS Price Prediction: Why the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Price is rising?\n\nThe recent surge in Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gains follows a call from Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin for ENS to expand onto multiple Layer 2s, emphasizing the importance of making ENS both highly significant and affordable.\n\nSince Buterin\u2019s tweet on January 3, ENS has experienced a renewed surge, reflecting optimism surrounding the ongoing rapid adoption of Ethereum. As a vital component of the ecosystem\u2019s infrastructure and development, the growth prospects of ENS seem closely linked to the anticipated bull run in the underlying Ethereum network.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY ENS<\u2014\n\nENS Price Prediction: How high can the ENS price go?\n\nOver the past year, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth, with its price surging by an impressive 70%. This performance positions ENS favorably, outperforming 56% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies during the same period, showcasing its resilience and competitiveness within the crypto market.\n\nTrading consistently above the 200-day simple moving average further underscores its sustained bullish momentum, providing a positive trend signal. The recent trend of 19 green days in the last 30, representing a 63% positive trading frequency, indicates strong investor confidence and positive sentiment surrounding ENS.\n\nAdditionally, its high liquidity, as evidenced by a substantial market cap, suggests robust market participation and further potential for sustained growth soon. These factors collectively suggest a promising outlook for ENS, with the potential for continued positive performance and an influential role in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nFrom a daily time frame perspective, the technical analysis indicates a bullish trend for Ethereum Name Service (ENS). However, there are signals suggesting a potential nearing of a local top. The bullish trend indicates an overall positive momentum in the market, with the price likely experiencing upward movements.\n\nNevertheless, the cautionary note about a local top suggests that the current bullish phase may be reaching a peak, and investors should be vigilant for signs of a potential reversal or consolidation.\n\nTherefore, based on the above points the projected trading range for Ethereum Name Service is expected to be between $23 and $49. Should the upper price target be achieved, ENS has the potential to experience a significant gain of more than 132%, reaching a value of $49.\n\n\u2014> CLICK HERE TO BUY ENS<\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "Fri 12 Jan 2024 \u25aa 7 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe date of January 10, 2024, is now enshrined in the annals of crypto with golden letters. Indeed, the anticipation of this deadline by the crypto and financial community for months was not in vain, as it marked the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF. The decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was eagerly awaited on this date. And it is favorable. now, a positive impact is expected on Bitcoin (BTC). But this outlook could impact the entire crypto industry, including Ethereum. In this context, effects on the Ether (ETH) market, Ethereum\u2019s native crypto, are also envisaged. That said, how would ETH react to this new development? Let\u2019s look at this together in this article.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF as a Reference for the Establishment of Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe SEC has finally approved the much-anticipated Bitcoin Spot ETF. A development that could have significant consequences on the Ethereum ecosystem. The approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF could serve as a regulatory framework for the emergence of an Ethereum Spot ETF. As a reminder, the American securities watchdog has received several Spot ETF requests on Ethereum in recent months. Specifically, those from Hashdex Nasdaq, Grayscale, VanEck, ARK Invest by Cathie Wood, and 21Shares especially.\n\nIn December 2023, the financial regulator postponed its decision regarding these various Ethereum Spot ETF applications to May 2024. On analysis, it seems that this deadline is related to the SEC\u2019s efforts to classify certain cryptos based on proof-of-stake (PoS) as securities.\n\nInterestingly, Ether (ETH), Ethereum\u2019s native crypto, has not been integrated into this category as part of the regulator\u2019s crackdown on other crypto platforms. Moreover, the SEC did not contest the classification of Ethereum during the process of recording its ETF with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nThus, analysts believe that with the Bitcoin Spot ETF now approved, the regulatory landscape surrounding Ethereum and other digital assets would be particularly simplified. This could be reflected in the valuation of the asset, which is currently trading at around $2,586, up 5.70% in the last 24 hours.\n\nConsequences Linked to the Correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nIt should be noted that Ethereum and Bitcoin platforms are the most significant in the crypto industry. As such, they maintain a notable correlation that could have significant implications for future ETH price movements. Analysts estimate that the confirmed approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF by regulatory authorities places ETH in pole position for a rally.\n\nThis anticipation is precisely based on the historical correlation between Bitcoin prices and ETH. A trend that has also been maintained throughout these last years. But the viability of this projection is dependent on a vital factor. Indeed, this new approval must not trigger a negative selling reaction. Certainly, the ETH market could experience an upward valuation. This is provided that demand increases in anticipation of broader adoption.\n\nIn any case, the Bitcoin Spot ETF should now serve as a crucial test. In particular, to measure the maturation of the crypto market and its integration into traditional financial spheres.\n\nIt should be noted that this development has rendered all pessimistic speculations concerning a delay or outright refusal of the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval obsolete. A prospect that some analysts suspected could potentially exert downward pressure on the ETH market in the short term. This could imply a correction period during which market participants would adjust their expectations.\n\nThe crypto platform Bitwise had even conducted investigations involving American financial advisors. Stakeholders in the finance sector whose skepticism, particularly that of 39% among them, she highlighted. In the end, there was more fear than harm. A reminder of the importance of taking even the most evident crypto speculations with a lot of caution and reserve.\n\nWhat are the Impacts for ETH Metrics?\n\nAs the historic decision regarding the Bitcoin Spot ETF has been made, changes are being observed in the price movements of Ether (ETH). The rate of Ethereum\u2019s native crypto seems to be following an uptrend, but with a structure that is progressively tightening.\n\nFrom a purely technical point of view, ETH aligns with the Fibonacci line at 0.236. This means that the price of ETH has retraced about 23.6% of the previous bullish move up to this level. Traders and technical analysts often monitor this Fibonacci level, as they can act as areas of trend reversal or consolidation.\n\nAnalysts think that the officialization of the Bitcoin Spot ETF could change market dynamics by creating a new price pattern. Traders might anticipate a new market phase marked by a potential price increase. This scenario presents optimistic prospects, anticipating an improvement target of about $3,870 by March. This level would represent an increase of approximately 75% compared to the current price and would coincide with the Fibonacci line of 0.786.\n\nMore broadly, some crypto-enthusiasts think that the approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETF will support the emergence of an Ethereum Spot ETF. This, with this perspective monopolizing the attention of investors and stimulating the soaring valuation of the asset which has increased by nearly 50% over the last 90 days.\n\nConclusion\n\nYesterday\u2019s historic approval, on Wednesday, January 10, of the very first Bitcoin Spot ETF by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could have significant repercussions on the Ethereum ecosystem. Analysts think that this approval would serve as a benchmark for the establishment of an Ethereum Spot ETF. This would simplify the regulatory landscape around Ethereum. This perspective, combined with the historical correlation between BTC and ETH prices, raises optimistic expectations for an Ether rally. However, caution is advised. A negative selling reaction could exert downward pressure on ETH in the short term.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Parallelized EVMs are gaining popularity, but they won't scale blockchains alone - Blockworks",
        "content": "Improving technology for scaling blockchains requires tackling multifaceted problems. New attempts to parallelize the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) have gained interest in recent weeks, as developers look for possibilities to increase transaction throughput.\n\nThe EVM is the execution environment that runs on Ethereum and its layer-2 rollups, and also has been adopted by other layer-1 networks such Avalanche, Binance Chain and many others, which use it to process smart contract code.\n\nIn typical EVM implementations, transactions are processed one after the other in the order they arrive. This simple approach can lead to longer processing times and higher costs when there are many transactions, explains Marina Guryeva, the CEO of Neon Labs, which is implementing the EVM as a smart contract on Solana.\n\n\u201cFor Ethereum, the traditional sequential execution model simplifies hardware requirements, but on the downside, it creates limitations in handling the increasing volume of transactions,\u201d Guryeva told Blockworks. \u201cThis worsens during peak usage times resulting in longer transaction wait times, higher gas fees vis-a-vis demand surge, and an overall fractured user experience.\u201d\n\nGuryeva said that much of the growing interest in parallel EVMs is due to its ability to tackle these challenges around blockchain scalability, addressing issues related to the blockchain trilemma.\n\n\u201cThe parallel processing approach addresses the longstanding challenges of scalability and transaction processing efficiency within the Ethereum network,\u201d Guryeva said.\n\nMany transactions can be processed at the same time, instead of sequentially, so long as they don\u2019t depend on each other.\n\nThere are other ways to achieve parallel processing, such as at the database-level with approaches such as sharding, that essentially divide Ethereum\u2019s state into smaller \u201cshards\u201d but full sharding remains years away.\n\nRead more: Dencun and Pralectra: Ethereum core devs chart an ambitious 2024\n\nParallelized EVMs, however, including the likes of Sei network, Monad and Neon, are already production ready or nearly so. The Sei network launched its mainnet in August 2023 and has seen recent monthly trading volume of about $136 million with a little over 29 thousand active DEX users, according to data compiled by Flipside Crypto.\n\nIts native token, SEI, has surged from around $0.23 at the beginning of December to around $0.68 today \u2014 an almost 200% jump. Neon too, has seen a significant increase in its token price, with NEON trading from $0.50 on Dec. 1 to roughly $2.55 today.\n\nMonad has yet to launch and does not yet have its own token.\n\nA look into popular parallel EVM protocols\n\nMuch of the work being done on the Neon EVM is to bring the Ethereum dapps into the Solana ecosystem, Guryeva said.\n\n\u201cIt is a fully compatible Ethereum environment on Solana and allows developers to scale Ethereum dapps using Solana as the settlement layer,\u201d she said.\n\nGuryeva notes that Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain that supports smart contracts and dapps, but Solana\u2019s Sealevel technology \u2014 which enables virtual machines to process multiple transactions simultaneously through distributing transaction workload across multiple threads on a validator\u2019s hardware \u2014 enables lower gas fees and higher scalability.\n\nJay Jog the co-founder of Sei Labs shares this sentiment, he notes that Ethereum rollups struggle to get over 30 sustained transactions per second, which limits the design space on the blockchain.\n\n\u201cA parallelized EVM lets you get the best of Ethereum and Solana \u2014 the EVM and all of the mindshare/tooling around it and the fast execution environment that Solana offers,\u201d he said.\n\nSei\u2019s latest version has its EVM built into the chain, Jog added.\n\n\u201cSei uses Geth \u2014 the Go implementation of the EVM \u2014 to get full EVM bytecode compatibility. Geth is very battle tested and currently processes ~85% of [Ethereum] blocks,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is different from its competitor Monad, which is creating a custom EVM implementation, Jog notes.\n\nDespite these differences, both Monad and Sei are using optimistic parallel execution to achieve parallel processing.\n\nWith this technique, virtual machines run in parallel on separate threads within the network computer. Each thread would execute transactions and generate what Keone Hon, the co-founder and CEO of Monad Labs, calls \u201cpending results.\u201d\n\nThese pending results track the inputs and outputs of the transactions which are then committed back into their original linear order. If any pending result has inputs that have been invalidated, then a transaction must be rescheduled.\n\n\u201cThis means that Monad still supports linear blocks and linear transactions within the blocks,\u201d Hon told Blockworks. \u201cMonad can basically take transaction formats that are exactly the same as Ethereum and then, under the hood, implement parallelism without any changes from the user perspective.\u201d\n\nOptimistic parallel execution is different from what Solana uses, for example, where dapps have to pre-specify dependencies of the transactions, Hon said, analogous to the access list approach on Ethereum.\n\nParallelized EVMs are a stepping stone\n\nIt is important to note, Hon adds, that parallel execution is a small fraction of the bigger picture, with Monad\u2019s more general mission being centered around accelerating EVM execution to make it as performant as possible.\n\n\u201cThe real bottleneck is actually the state access that all of those transactions are being run, they all have dependencies on state, and that state lives on SSD (solid-state drive),\u201d Hon said.\n\nThe majority of smart contract work has relatively simple computation, he said, and bigger constraints for smart contracts are often the input/output component \u2014 the process of reading from the SSD and then writing back data.\n\nParallelism only cuts a small fraction of costs, according to Rachel Bousfield, the tech lead at Offchain Labs, because parallel execution is rarely possible in practice across current Web3 dapps.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nEthereum-like blockchains generally use commodity databases for reading and writing data. These have the advantage of being widely accessible, purchased \u201coff the shelf,\u201d but they are not optimized for the problem of storing the Merkle tree data, necessary for parallel processing on the blockchain, Hon notes.\n\nThis means that, fundamentally, in order to decrease transaction processing times and gas prices, infrastructure around the database will have to change.\n\n\u201cSo one of the other really major things that Monad is building is a custom state database from scratch that supports parallel access so that when there are many threads running in parallel, touching the database \u2014 to get inputs, or write outbacks back to it \u2014 those can proceed in parallel,\u201d Hon said.\n\nMonad is not alone in focusing on alleviating state dependencies. Sei too, is working to make improvements in this area, Jog notes.\n\n\u201cWe are doing a lot of work on the state layer to improve state access, state commit, and state storage,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "What is Ethereum Staking and How to Stake ETH? - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has undergone a significant transformation with its shift to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, known as Ethereum 2.0 or Eth2. This change from the previous Proof-of-Work (PoW) system not only addresses environmental concerns but also enhances scalability and reduces centralization issues.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Staking\n\nStaking in Ethereum involves validators locking up their ETH tokens to secure the network. These validators play a crucial role in confirming transactions, checking the validity of new blocks, and occasionally creating and propagating new blocks. The transition to PoS brings several improvements over PoW, including better energy efficiency and reduced hardware requirements.\n\nThe Process of Staking Ethereum\n\nTo become a validator on Ethereum, one needs to deposit a minimum of 32 ETH into the deposit contract and run a validator client. Ethereum operates in epochs, each lasting approximately 6.4 minutes. The network has a churn limit to manage the number of validators joining or leaving during each epoch, ensuring the stability of the PoS consensus mechanism.\n\nActivation and Rewards\n\nThe activation as a validator depends on various factors, including the number of validators in the queue and the demand for staking. Validators need to wait for at least four epochs before activation to prevent manipulation of the random beacon that selects validators. Once activated, validators start earning rewards, which include newly minted ETH earned through block proposals and attestations.\n\nFactors Influencing Staking Rewards\n\nThe rewards from Ethereum staking are influenced by the amount of ETH staked, the behavior of validators, and market volatility. Validators are incentivized to act honestly to avoid penalties like slashing, where a portion of the validator\u2019s staked ETH is burned for dishonest or uncooperative behavior.\n\nRisks and Considerations\n\nStaking ETH involves potential risks such as market volatility, illiquidity, technical issues, and financial penalties. The price of ETH can impact the value of staked assets and rewards. Validators who fail to adhere to network rules or experience technical malfunctions can face penalties, including the loss of a portion of their staked ETH.\n\nStaking Options\n\nEthereum staking can be done independently, through staking-as-a-service, or via pooled staking. Independent staking offers maximum control but requires technical expertise and a significant time commitment. Staking-as-a-service and pooled staking are less technical and suitable for smaller amounts of ETH but involve some degree of control surrender and counterparty risk.\n\nBenefits of Staking\n\nStaking Ethereum allows validators to earn passive income on their ETH holdings. It also gives them the right to participate in network governance decisions, contributing to the network\u2019s security and scalability. By replacing energy-intensive mining with human validation, Ethereum staking is more environmentally friendly and lowers the barrier to entry for network participation.\n\nBest Ethereum Staking Platforms\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism with the \u201cMerge\u201d event in 2022, staking has become a popular way to earn passive rewards. Choosing the right platform for staking Ethereum, considering factors like security, annual percentage yield (APY), and ease of use, is crucial. Here\u2019s a look at the top Ethereum staking platforms:\n\nCoinbase\n\nKnown for its high compliance and security, Coinbase launched \u201cCoinbase Earn,\u201d offering a 3.25% APY on staked Ethereum. It stands out for its user-friendly interface, making it ideal for beginners. The platform doesn\u2019t impose a lock-up period, but unstaking times depend on the protocol. Coinbase also offers a synthetic staked ETH token, cbETH, which can be traded externally.\n\nRocketpool\n\nThis decentralized staking solution offers a non-rebasing synthetic ETH, rETH, which accrues value over time. With a 3.27% APY, Rocketpool is permissionless, allowing anyone to run a node, enhancing its decentralization. Its rETH token structure might offer tax efficiency, depending on jurisdiction.\n\nLido\n\nA decentralized liquid staking solution, Lido offers a 3.8% APY on staked ETH. It allows users to earn multiple yields and uses the $LIDO token for decentralized governance. Users receive a synthetic version of their token, stETH, which can be used in various dApps to earn additional yields.\n\nBinance\n\nAs the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance offers a \u201cDeFi Staking\u201d feature with opportunities on various coins including ETH, with APRs ranging from 0.2% to 6%. It provides flexibility in lock-in periods and daily rewards. Binance\u2019s ETH 2.0 staking pays rewards in \u201cBETH,\u201d which can be redeemed for ETH at any time. The platform is known for its low trading fees, further reduced by using Binance Coin (BNB).\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum staking is a critical component of the network\u2019s PoS consensus mechanism, offering validators the opportunity to earn rewards while contributing to the network\u2019s security and governance. However, it\u2019s essential for potential validators to understand the process, the factors influencing rewards, and the associated risks before participating in Ethereum staking.\n\nMore from Ethereum"

        "content": "Zameer is a financial analyst and writer with a particular interest in cryptocurrency markets. He has been studying cryptocurrencies and their market behavior for several years and deeply understands the factors that affect the price of cryptocurrencies. His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nThe past few months have been rewarding for Bitcoin (BTC) investors following the high-impact spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approval news. As a result, Bitcoins short-term holders (STH) and miners have accelerated profit-taking in the recent past amid heightened speculation of sell-the-news possibility.\n\nMeanwhile, on-chain data analysis shows crypto whales and investors are getting focused on Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins showing potential for a bullish outlook in the near term. Moreover, ETF experts believe there is a high probability that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the spot Ethereum ETFs by May this year.\n\nExperts on Ethereum Price Action\n\n#Ethereum flipped the crucial level at $2,130 for continuation.\n\n\n\nAfter that, breakout towards new cycle highs at $2,700 and looking for continuation to $3,500 in the coming 2-3 months. pic.twitter.com/4m1RkEUqxp \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 12, 2024\n\nHaving risen about 23 percent this week to reach a fresh two-year high of around $2,689, Ethereum price action is likely to continue in a bullish outlook in the near future, if the instrument manages to consistently close above the resistance/support level around $2,400.\n\nAccording to a reputable crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, Ethereum price is en route to reach $3,500 in the next few months.

        "content": "Is It Too Late to Buy Ethereum Classic? ETC Price Pumps 56% as This Meme Coin Goes Viral\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC), the original Ethereum hard fork, has recently experienced a massive spike in its price, rallying more than 50% amid the broader market excitement over Bitcoin ETF approvals and speculation about upcoming Ethereum ETFs.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s Resurgence: A Closer Look at the ETC Price Action\n\nThe ETC price currently stands at $30.61, with the moving averages presenting a bullish outlook. The 20-day EMA at $29.30, 50-day EMA at $27.44, and the 100-day EMA at $25.08, all align to signal a strong uptrend. This arrangement typically indicates sustained bullish sentiment, suggesting that the ETC price may continue its upward trajectory in the short term.\n\nMACD and RSI: Bullish but Overbought\n\nThe MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is echoing the bullish sentiment, with today\u2019s value at 1.28 compared to yesterday\u2019s 0.71, indicating strengthening momentum.\n\nThe RSI (Relative Strength Index) presents a cautionary case, however. Standing at a high of 81.28, up from 79.03, the ETC price is deep into the overbought territory. This could suggest a potential retracement or consolidation phase ahead, as overbought conditions often lead to price pullbacks.\n\nSupport and Resistance Levels\n\nThe recent price action of ETC saw it successfully retesting the golden FIB levels at $27.40 and $26.96, now established as strong support zones. Currently, ETC is consolidating around the 0.786 FIB level, with an overhead resistance at $32.29. If this resistance is broken, the next targets are $40.92 and $54.88. Additional support levels are found at $28.20, $25.31, and $23.66, providing a safety net for the ETC price against potential downward corrections.\n\nETC Price Action Prediction\n\nIn light of the technical indicators, a cautiously optimistic stance seems prudent for ETC. While the current trajectory and moving averages indicate further upside, the overbought RSI levels warrant vigilance. Traders might consider setting stop-loss orders just below key support levels to manage risks effectively while capitalizing on the ETC price\u2019s potential growth.\n\nGiven the current market dynamics, Ethereum Classic\u2019s alignment with Ethereum\u2019s EVM through the upcoming Spiral fork, and the rising interest in Ethereum ETFs, the ETC price is likely to maintain its bullish momentum.\n\nIn any case, traders should be prepared for volatility and potential pullbacks due to the overbought conditions. The key will be to watch how the ETC price interacts with the identified resistance and support levels to gauge the strength of the ongoing trend.\n\nWhile an Ethereum ETF would likely boost ETC further, investors are already turning their sights to the other potential breakouts, including in the red hot meme coin space\u2014Meme Kombat.\n\nVisit Meme Kombat Here\n\nIs Meme Kombat the Next Big Meme Coin?\n\nAfter Dogecoin and Shiba Inu led the way for meme coins in 2021, developers have been creating new crypto projects that focus on viral online popularity and engaging communities to drive adoption. One of the latest examples is Meme Kombat, which brings popular internet memes to life through a unique battle arena experience.\n\nMe rolling up to the next family gathering after the ETF approval: pic.twitter.com/QwYytVmmFE \u2014 Meme Kombat (@Meme_Kombat) January 11, 2024\n\nAt the core of Meme Kombat is its MK token, which allows users to wager on fight outcomes between AI-controlled meme characters. Winners can earn additional MK tokens as prizes, which can then be staked to generate yields as high as 155% annually according to the whitepaper. Meme Kombat plans to follow a seasonal format with new characters and battle types added regularly to maintain interest.\n\nThe presale for MK has already raised over $6.69 million, with the final stage now underway ahead of a planned Uniswap listing. Investors can still participate in the presale to purchase tokens at a lower price than the expected Uniswap price.\n\nBattling For Meme Crypto Supremacy\n\nProjects often see heightened volatility and interest around their DEX listings as liquidity improves. Meme Kombat backers hope to ride any potential price wave at launch after the presale have seen tokens gain 52% in value already.\n\nWith meme coins like Bonk and Pepe exploding last year to billion-dollar valuations, there\u2019s still be room for new entrants to make their mark in 2024. If Meme Kombat can continue leveraging its viral meme concept and engaged community, it could become the next standout in the space behind Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.\n\nVisit Meme Kombat Here"

        "title": "Larry Fink of BlackRock Signals Shift with Ethereum ETF Interest - CryptoCoin.News",
        "content": ".\n\nIn a striking nod to the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has recently expressed a strong interest in Ethereum ETFs (exchange-traded funds). This move signifies a potential turning point in the digital finance landscape, particularly at a time when cryptocurrencies are making significant strides towards mainstream acceptance.\n\nFink, at the helm of the world\u2019s most colossal asset management firm, brings significant influence to the table. His interest in Ethereum ETFs not only underscores the cryptocurrency\u2019s escalating importance in digital finance but also hints at a possible shift in investment strategies favoring blockchain technologies. \u201cI\u2019m a believer in cryptocurrency as an asset class, not a currency,\u201d Fink remarked, a statement that echoes the sentiment of many modern investors who view digital currencies as viable long-term investments rather than mere transactional tools.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s pivot towards Ethereum ETFs is likely to set a precedent for other major financial institutions, potentially catalyzing a broader acceptance and integration of Ethereum in traditional financial portfolios. This would further cement Ethereum\u2019s role as a frontrunner in the cryptocurrency sphere.\n\nThe interest in Ethereum ETFs comes on the heels of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which has been met with a notable influx of \u2018smart money\u2019 into Ethereum. This trend is a testament to the growing confidence of savvy investors in Ethereum\u2019s potential. While decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes remain modest compared to centralized exchanges (CEXs), significant investment movements in major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are primarily driven by activities on CEXs.\n\nAs one analyst pointed out, \u201cOver the last 24 hours, we once again see ETH having the largest smart money inflows. However, it\u2019s important to understand that DEX volumes are still small compared to CEXs, and large price movements in large caps are likely due to volume on centralized exchanges, which we won\u2019t have oversight of.\u201d This statement highlights the importance of centralized exchanges in the current cryptocurrency landscape, despite the increasing popularity of decentralized platforms.\n\nFink\u2019s endorsement of Ethereum ETFs could mark a pivotal moment for the crypto market. It not only illustrates the growing acceptance of digital assets by established financial entities but also signals a broader shift in how these assets are perceived and utilized within the investment community.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, the interest of major financial players like BlackRock in Ethereum ETFs is not just a passing trend but a clear indicator of the growing integration of digital assets into the fabric of global finance. This move could inspire confidence among investors and pave the way for a more diverse and robust cryptocurrency market, where Ethereum plays a leading role.\n\nIn conclusion, the attention Ethereum ETFs are receiving from influential figures like Larry Fink is a significant marker of the changing tides in the world of finance. As traditional and digital finance increasingly intersect, the role of cryptocurrencies in investment strategies is set to evolve, bringing new opportunities and challenges for investors and financial institutions alike. With BlackRock\u2019s potential entry into the Ethereum ETF market, the cryptocurrency landscape is poised for further growth and mainstream acceptance, heralding an exciting era for digital finance."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price falls to around $46,000 during Friday\u2019s Asian session, correcting from the two-year high of $48,900 seen on Thursday. Bitcoin\u2019s rally was likely caused by rising market interest following the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) that track Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nPEPE (PEPE), a frog-themed meme coin, registered an increase in its reserves on cryptocurrency exchanges, which reached the highest level in two months.

        "title": "Round 2 of Mollars ICO for the \u201cNew Bitcoin of the Ethereum Blockchain\u201d Sells Out in 24 Hours - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe Mollars ($MOLLARS) token presale continues forward, breaking new records daily for transaction amounts and total tokens sold. The \u201cBitcoin killer\u201d or \u201c$BTC of the Ethereum Network,\u201d as Crypto Potato called it, completed its 2nd round of the Initial Coin Offering [ICO] today in record time. Also, the number of big crypto holders increased tremendously, resetting the record for a single buy. Now that the 3rd round of the ICO has begun and tokens are selling for 0.45 cents, late users may be seeing their last time ever to accumulate the token under the price of half a dollar (50 cents).\n\nSmart money crypto holders have been loading up on Mollars tokens at the presale costs of $0.30 and $0.45 all week. The last 48 hours, however, saw a tremendous explosion, as predicted by crypto website analysts after word circulated that Mollars saves Dollars for those looking to buy Bitcoins by offering a store-of-value like the $BTC but with the lesser fees of Ethereum-blockchain.\n\nHowever, not even the analysts could have predicted how much of a parabolic burst the Mollars.com ICO would have experienced yesterday, January 10th. Over 133 tokens were purchased by crypto investors per second throughout the entire 24 hours of Wednesday.\n\nThe end result of the great activity, of course, was \u2018round 2\u2019 of the Mollars ICO closing. The ERC-20 token presale is in its 3rd phase, and token prices have increased by 5 cents. And while 5 cents is a rise in costs, it\u2019s still far from being seen as a risk, judging by additional analyst reports and predictions on ROI Yields.\n\nThe $MOLLARS token\u2019s first predictions can now be considered factual. The ICO sales exploded, and it does not appear the presale will last until its May 2024 deadline. Instead, it\u2019s likely to close by reaching the hard cap and selling out the full token supply allocated for the Initial Coin Offering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly 4-million tokens will be sold at early, discounted rates. That\u2019s 40% of the total token supply to be minted, 10-Million $MOLLARS.\n\nAccording to the whitepaper, Mollars will launch on a public crypto exchange [CEX/DEX] after the ICO closes. It will be listed on exchanges at a price of $ 0.62 cents. This would likely yield initial proceeds to current holders of up to $0.17 to $0.32 (cents) per token, depending on which round of the ICO the tokens were purchased. These earnings are between a +38% to +106.7% ROI yield.\n\nIn comparison, commodities like the precious metal Gold yielded less than +20% to investors for the entire 2024 year.\n\nThose crypto exchange listing days\u2019 instant yields are not likely the \u2018big picture\u2019 for the Mollars core of investors. It\u2019s the short and long-term ROI yields after the token\u2019s been listed on a major crypto exchange for a relative period, that Whales and Sharks are expected to hold these Bitcoin alternative tokens for.\n\nThese smart digital money will probably wait for the other predictions to come true. Analysts think the demand for $MOLLARS tokens is signalling a parabolic uptrend in value throughout the next few years.\n\nDue to high demand and low token supply, alongside the nature of the coin being a solution to Bitcoin trading fees, whole tokens could disappear before 2025. If that happens, the brand value should be at an all-time high, mirroring demand.\n\nAs users begin to trade tokens in fractions (pieces), the owners of whole coins could see their portfolio skyrocket by +10,000% or more before the end of 2025. At a 100x in value, such an ROI yield would make any buyer of a whole token before $1 a big-time winner.\n\nAnd the long-term prediction from analysts is even more shocking \u2014 at least to people who\u2019ve not watched crypto brands like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), moon shooting throughout the last decade.\n\nIf transaction activity and demand after being listed on a crypto exchange [DEX or CEX] mirror what\u2019s going on with Mollars.com ICO transaction history, it could go into a hyper-parabolic uptrend in the next few years. If the \u2018wildcard prediction\u2019 of the token follows the rival Bitcoin\u2019s growth from its debut, it could see up to +9,500,000% ROI yields.\n\nBitcoin yielded even more to bitcoiners. ROI Yields on the $BTC from its 2011 prices have topped +20,000,000% in the last decade.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that Mollars could outperform Bitcoin if massive adoption takes place. It will have a more limited supply than Bitcoin. Only 10 million $MOLLARS will be minted ever, compared to 21 million BTC. That scarcity and a push of branding to solidify the name in the crypto community could see token value surges that are not yet calculable.\n\nBeing a solution to Bitcoin trading\u2019s massive fees and saving traders money is powerful. Everyone likes to save money, and the Ethereum-Blockchain has 250 million users that could potentially save money at any time they want a Store-of-Value token.\n\nOther key features of the Mollars cryptocurrency that are important are that it\u2019s decentralized, has no owner, and will have professional infrastructure.\n\nThe creator of the Mollars token, like Satoshi, who made Bitcoin, remains anonymous for eternity. The token\u2019s being created to solve a problem and will be released to the public in its entirety. All 10-million $MOLLARS tokens minted will be sold, and owners will hold 0% nor those developing its overall infrastructure.\n\nA web3 product will be developed to launch in conjunction with the token\u2019s public trading debut on crypto exchanges. This development will not be revealed early but will be a catalyst for $MOLLARS development. The web3 dAPP will require Mollars tokens for transactions to take place.\n\nA professional marketing team will be hired to push the Mollars brand on public exchanges for months after its launch to boost branding value. The marketers\u2019 quest will be structured before its CEX/DEX debut and driven autonomously after the creator fades away.\n\nThe 4 million ICO tokens being sold will help fund all of the above, according to the whitepaper of Mollars. These sales should total around US$2MM, but at least $ 1 million dollars will be exclusive to the locked liquidity pool. That liquid cash reserves will ensure the token has stability on the crypto exchange and all traders can sell tokens without problems.\n\nTo the hour, the Mollars Initial Coin Offering has secured over $200k. Round 3 of the ICO will close after 700,000 more tokens have been sold.\n\nVisit Mollars.com to buy tokens and view the latest presale activity. If the 3rd round sells out in less than 3 days, it\u2019s highly probable this initial coin offering will close before January 2024\u2019s end.\n\nDisclaimer: The \u2018Crypto Cable\u2019 section features crypto industry players and is not part of ZyCrypto\u2019s editorial content.

        "content": "The rise of AI has brought new perspectives to the cryptocurrency market, making it easier for investors to conduct research and analysis.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s model ChatGPT has been the most-used analytical tool, offering objective price predictions for hundreds of coins and tokens.\n\nThis article explores ChatGPT\u2019s price forecasts for three trending cryptos, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, and Bitcoin Minetrix, discussing whether they could be in line for a lucrative 2024.\n\nChatGPT Predicts Bitcoin Cash Could See Strong Gains in 2024\n\nThe first cryptocurrency that ChatGPT highlighted is Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which is up 24% in the past seven days.\n\nWith BCH currently trading at $295, the AI model considered recent market-moving events like the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US.\n\nChatGPT states these ETF approvals will likely stir up positive sentiment across the crypto sector, presenting potential upside for major altcoins like BCH.\n\nSpecifically, ChatGPT predicts the regulatory green light for Bitcoin ETFs may spur increased retail and institutional demand into the broader crypto market.\n\nAs a prominent fork of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash stands to benefit from this rising interest.\n\nIf these bullish trends continue, ChatGPT projects BCH could climb to a price range between $350 and $450 by the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, the model notes that BCH could see even greater gains if its own fundamental developments and real-world usage as a payments coin continue growing.\n\nChatGPT Forecasts Ethereum Classic Price Nearly Double After Upcoming Hard Fork\n\nMoving on to Ethereum Classic (ETC), ChatGPT has taken a bullish stance on the original Ethereum chain and its prospects in 2024.\n\nWith ETC changing hands at $29, the model noted impressive one-week gains of 47% leading into its forecast.\n\nChatGPT also highlighted ETC\u2019s upcoming hard fork, scheduled for February, which aims to boost compatibility between Ethereum Classic\u2019s EVM and the dominant Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAccording to the AI model, successfully implementing this hard fork could significantly increase ETC\u2019s utility among decentralized app developers.\n\nIf more DeFi and Web3 projects build on a fork aligned with the Ethereum Classic, ChatGPT predicts increased adoption and investment inflows could push ETC to between $35 and $50 by the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, the model caveats its prediction on the smooth technical execution of the upcoming hard fork upgrade.\n\nIf network instability were to occur, some enthusiasm towards Ethereum Classic could evaporate \u2013 hurting the ETC price.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s Stake-to-Mine Model Could Fuel 681% Growth, According to ChatGPT\n\nAlongside Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic, a new player has emerged that ChatGPT is also bullish on \u2013 Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).\n\nBitcoin Minetrix aims to reshape the mining sphere by utilizing a \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d model, where users can stake their BTCMTX tokens and earn cloud mining credits.\n\nThese credits can then provide power to mine Bitcoin virtually.\n\nThis breakthrough makes Bitcoin mining accessible to anyone without the high barriers to entry of specialized gear or software.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix also has a high-yield staking protocol for BTCMTX \u2013 with more than 531 million tokens staked already.\n\nGiven its innovative Stake-to-Mine features, ChatGPT is optimistic about Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s growth potential.\n\nWith BTCMTX on offer for $0.0128 in its ongoing presale, the project has already raised over $8.2 million, indicating strong investor demand.\n\nLooking ahead, ChatGPT sees several catalysts that could push BTCMTX\u2019s price higher in 2024.\n\nThese include the simplicity of cloud mining and high APY staking rewards, which may attract new and experienced investors.\n\nConsidering these growth factors, ChatGPT predicts that if Bitcoin Minetrix can ride post-listing momentum and investor interest, the BTCMTX price could reach $0.05 to $0.10 by the end of the year.\n\nShould this scenario play out, it would mean returns of 290% and 681% for those who invest in the presale today.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "Ethereum Developers Cite Blockchain State to Oppose Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Gas Limit Increase Proposal\n\nEthereum developers have expressed concerns over the recent proposal by the network\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin to increase the gas limit on the blockchain.\n\nOpposition to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Proposal\n\nIn a Jan 11 blog post, Ethereum developer, Marius van der Wijden wrote \u201cWhy increasing the gas fee is difficult and pointed at the size of the blockchain state and resulting consequences as a key concern.\n\nI wrote down some of my thoughts on raising the gas limit today: https://t.co/gX0eihUyYa (Haven't proof-read it, so if you find a mistake, you can keep it) \u2014 MariusVanDerWijden (@vdWijden) January 11, 2024\n\nAccording to him, raising the gas limit at the moment poses a risk to state size, missed block rate, synchronization times, history size, and client diversity while also proffering solutions to cover flagged areas if it\u2019s the way forward.\n\nThe total size needed for the blockchain state which contains the contract data is 267 gigabytes while the total blockchain history stands at about 900 gigabytes which can lead to more growth should gas sizes increase.\n\nOn Oct 11, 2023, the total state storage was 87 GB while on June 6, 2023, it was less than 80 GB meaning it recorded a growth of almost 2 GB per month.\n\nTo put this into perspective, the space will be 111 GB in the next twelve months and 207 GB in the next five years making accessing and modifying such a large amount of data difficult.\n\n\u201cAnd this is only the snapshot, which is the plain state. Geth needs to store this state in a different form as well in order to verify the state root. This other format (the trie nodes) needs roughly 180GB at block 18418786.\u201d\n\nHistory and sync dilemma\n\nHistory size remains another challenge as transaction count doubled in the last three years and with the deployment of layer 2 networks, history has become more important.\n\n\u201cEIP-4444 will solve the history growth problem since full nodes don\u2019t need to store all of the history anymore. Implementing EIP-4444 requires a robust network for retrieving the history before we can allow full nodes to stop serving the history though,\u201d the post added.\n\nRaising the gas limit will increase the difficulty in building new clients for the mainnet as Geth is already with 10 years of experience leaving new clients the option of learning from previous ones.\n\nIncreasing the gas limit makes the full sync slower because of the need to download more data affecting the speeds of snap healing, history, and catching up.\n\nAnother Ethereum developer Peter Szilagyi wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that state size will grow faster along with DoS while sync will get slower.\n\nWhat problem does increasing the gas limit solve? Increasing it definitely has a downside. State will grow faster, sync time will get slower quicker, DoS potential will grow. Would be nice to have a number on those. That said, what does increasing the gas limit net us? \u2014 P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi (karalabe.eth) (@peter_szilagyi) January 11, 2024\n\n\u201cI feel we\u2019re kind of yoloing this. Do we have the monitoring and metrics in place to see how things evolve? If not, IMO we should first have tooling that can point to the effect of a change *before* making that change. Otherwise, it\u2019s gonna get summed to \u201clook, not dead yet\u201d."

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nEthereum is the biggest altcoin, with a crypto market cap of about $223.3 billion. It is also often seen as the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold and is expected to run well in 2024. Different reasons back up this expectation. Some other altcoins like Borroe Finance ($ROE) and Injective (INJ) also aim for and project high profits in 2024.\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCan ETH Hit $4000 in 2024?\n\nRallying by over 85% in 2023 despite the bearish conditions of the space, Ethereum forecasts say it might exceed $4000 in 2024. A significant reason for this prediction is the expected spot-bitcoin ETF approval. This is because the approval of the Bitcoin ETF will set a precedent for the ETH ETF approvals expected by Q2 and Q3 of 2024. This expected approval will also serve as a factor for the continual rise of the Ethereum price.\n\nAnother factor is the Merge, the beginning of which would introduce the sharding on the Ethereum blockchain by splitting the network into small, manageable shard chains.\n\nBy introducing the sharding update, the Ethereum blockchain developers achieve the goals of crosslinking, increased opportunities for validators, and scalability. The Merge updates and the ETF are good enough catalysts to keep ETH bullish in 2024. As of this writing, ETH sold for $2,297.75.\n\nThe Over 200% Waiting at the End of the $ROE Presale\n\nThe steady climb towards completion of its presale has proven $ROE\u2019s value in the crypto space. As the native token of the Borroe Finance project, the worthy value of $ROE is imminent.\n\nBorroe Project presents an AI-powered ecosystem for Web3 creators to raise upfront cash flow through its instant funding model. Through Borroe Finance, the creators can mint NFTs to represent their future earnings and incomes. These NFTs are sold at a discount on the Borroe marketplace, where the Web3 creators and Web3 investors meet. The whole process is risk-assessed and managed by AI. This is an alternative to the incompatible traditional financing options for the Web3 creators.\n\nThe project team comprises members like Maxim Prishchepo, who has a wealth of experience in AI technologies and multi-billion-dollar blockchain projects, and Michael Price, the Chief Product Officer, who brings over 25 years of financial expertise. Coupling the project\u2019s use case and the pedigree of individuals in the team with the successful smart contract audit by BlockAudit makes it obvious why investors have recognized $ROE as a token that belongs in their portfolio.\n\nAs of this writing, Stage 4 of the ongoing Borroe Finance Presale will be over in a matter of hours. The presale began at $0.0125 and is presently going for $0.0190. By the conclusion of the presale phase, $ROE will be going for $0.040, which is over 200% of the starting price.\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\nInjective and Expectations from its Volan Mainnet Upgrade\n\nInjective Protocol is a blockchain protocol optimized for trading across blockchains. It is an open, interoperable Layer-1 smart contracts platform for decentralized finance applications.\n\nBy mid-December, INJ, the native token of Injective, completed a 3,000% rise in price in 2023, hitting $39.15. Analysts attribute this surge to the protocol\u2019s combination of AI with DeFi. This allows decentralized apps (dapps) built on Injective to use AI algorithms to improve market efficiency and optimize user decisions.\n\nAnother factor that will raise the price of INJ in 2024 is the Injective Volan Mainnet upgrade, which, following acceptance of the proposal, will take place on January 11, 2024. With the promised capabilities, features, and improvements to follow the upgrade, INJ should chase and hit higher profits than it achieved in 2023.\n\nAs of this writing, INJ sold for $42.62, up 16.0% and 125.1% on its 24-hour and 30-day charts, respectively. Just like INJ, $ROE is on a high-profit trail.\n\nLearn more about Borroe Finance ($ROE) here:\n\nVisit Borroe Finance Presale | Join The Telegram Group | Follow Borroe Finance on Twitter"
