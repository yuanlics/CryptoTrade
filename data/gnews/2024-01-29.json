Of particular significance is the largest single liquidation order, which took place on Bybit, involving a BTC-USDT value of $2.17 million.\n\nIn other news, Invesco and Galaxy Asset Management announced on Monday that they will reduce the sponsor fee on their latest spot Bitcoin ETF. Despite being ranked sixth in trading volumes within the growing market, their product has seen over $280 million in buying and selling activity, with a similar amount of capital in assets under management.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Pendle CRYPTO: PENDLE) +15.80% $2.67 Sui SUI/USD +15.78% $1.63 Ordi ORDI/USD +11.76% $62.15\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.63 trillion, showing a 0.54% increase in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe S&P 500 surged on Monday as Wall Street eagerly anticipated upcoming mega-cap tech earnings reports and the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate policy decision.\n\nThe benchmark index saw a 0.76% increase, closing at 4,927.93, surpassing its previous record of 4,894.16 set on Jan. 25.

Remember; we're in a bull market and the ETF approval is more significant than you might think it is.\"\n\nLoading... Loading...\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez reported that significant Bitcoin transactions totaling over 516,000 BTC have occurred within specific price ranges, namely $16,500, $26,770, and $42,550.\n\n\"The $16,500 level was a crucial support in November 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, $26,770 sustained #Bitcoin\u2019s price during the summer of 2023.\n\nNow, $42,550 may emerge as the most critical support zone for $BTC this year.\"\n\nPhoto by SvetlanaParnikova on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

And as the industry matures, change inevitably comes for the industry.\n\nThe big cryptocurrency investment strategy for this year is the rise of institutional capital. With the advent of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), large financial firms can now safely deploy capital into Bitcoin with the click of a button.

On January 11th, the SEC approved the trading of 11 different ETFs devoted to Bitcoin. Those included funds such as iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (NYSE:BTCO), which have attracted substantial amounts of investor capital since launching a few weeks ago.\n\nUp until January 2024, investors had much more limited access to Bitcoin on American stock exchanges. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEARCA:GBTC) was operating as a trust but could only trade on the Pink Sheets. Previously, the SEC blocked Grayscale\u2019s petition to convert itself into an ETF.\n\nNow, though, Grayscale has been able to become an ETF, and that fund conversion has ushered in the approval of all other sorts of digital asset ETFs as well.

The SEC is expected to rule on whether or not it will approve Ethereum ETFs later this spring. Some analysts are hopeful this could lead to a major rally in the price of ETH.\n\nStory continues\n\nBears might contend that cryptocurrency prices initially sold off in the wake of the Bitcoin ETF approvals, which is true. However, in that case, the Grayscale Bitcoin fund already had a large sum of capital in it, and once the ETFs were approved, a large chunk of money was transferred out of that GBTC product into other funds with lower expense ratios.\n\nWith that shift largely taken care of, future inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs should be a net positive for the ecosystem and support higher prices. In any case, there is not much money in Ethereum trusts; an Ethereum ETF would tap a more unclaimed market, potentially leading to significant upside later this year.\n\nCrypto to Sell: Floki Inu (FLOKI-USD)\n\nFloki Inu price predictions.

And in attracting this more professional class of investors, the overall digital asset landscape changes.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen more speculative parts of the crypto landscape, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), lose popularity. Meme coins are likely to be another loser during this shift.\n\nTake Floki Inu (FLOKI-USD) for example.
