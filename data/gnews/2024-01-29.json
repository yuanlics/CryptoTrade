        "title": "What Is Ethereum Restaking? A Beginner's Guide - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethereum restaking, as proposed by the Ethereum-based middleware protocol EigenLayer, involves reusing staked ETH tokens to secure other protocols. Proponents of restaking believe it can be used to amplify trust across networks, while detractors are worried about its possible ramifications.\n\nRead on to learn what Ethereum restaking is, how it works, and the pros and cons of restaking ETH tokens.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum Restaking?\n\nBefore we can delve into restaking, we need to understand staking digital assets in PoS networks.\n\nStaking refers to network participants locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency on-chain to secure the network in exchange for staking rewards.\n\nOn Ethereum, it means locking up 32 ETH into a validator, which acts as an economic incentive for validators to act honestly when verifying transactions. In this process, a validator commits to producing Ethereum blocks and maintains the integrity of the Ethereum network. The economic incentive for validators is earning ETH rewards.\n\nHowever, if they attempt to manipulate the network or act dishonestly, they are penalized and stand to lose their staked ETH in an act called slashing.\n\nEthereum restaking refers to simultaneously using your staked ETH to secure other protocols and earn rewards. In other words, you are depositing your already staked ether tokens in another protocol to extend the same trust generated by Ethereum\u2019s validators to the new protocol.\n\nDuring this process, your ETH will remain staked on Ethereum, and validators will continue confirming transactions, but your staking power will now expand to other protocols. Restakers will earn additional rewards for their ETH stake but will be penalized or \u201cslashed\u201d for failing to perform their staking duties.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Restaking Work?\n\nEigenLayer\n\ndeploys smart contracts on Ethereum so ETH stakers can restake their assets on external protocols. EigenLayer acts as the conduit through which you can restake your staked ETH tokens, as well as a decentralized trust marketplace for stakers looking to compound their yields.\n\nEigenLayer provides two ways to restake: native restaking or LSD restaking.\n\nNative restaking allows you to restake your ETH stake directly to EigenLayer by assigning your validator\u2019s withdrawal credentials to EigenLayer\u2019s smart contracts (EigenPod).\n\nLSD restaking is you restaking your liquid-staked tokens. You can stake ETH on liquid-staking platforms such as Lido and Rocket Pool. Liquid staking is less complicated and has a lower barrier of entry than running your Ethereum validator. You can then restake your liquid-staked tokens.\n\nEigenLayer\n\nallows you to stake Lido ETH (stETH), Rocket Pool ETH (rETH), Coinbase Staked Ether (cbETH), and more liquid staked assets.\n\nHow to Restake Ethereum\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at how you can restake your ETH.\n\nSet up a Web3 wallet: Get a Web3 wallet to allow you to interact with DeFi protocols and dApps. If you have already staked ETH on liquid staking platforms, you can deposit it directly into the wallet. Connect your wallet to the EigenLayer App: Navigate to app.eigenlayer.xyz and connect your wallet to the protocol. The page will display the assets supported on EigenLayer and the TVL of each locked in the smart contracts. Select a restaking option: Choose the method of restaking that works for you. If you are a validator running your node, then native restaking is optimum. Alternatively, you can select your preferred liquid staking token and input the desired amount. Confirm your transaction: Confirm your deposit on EigenLayer and in-wallet to ensure the transaction is complete.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Restaking Ethereum\n\nHere, we explore several benefits and drawbacks of restaking Ethereum for validators, protocols, and developers.\n\nPros\n\nAdditional rewards: The most obvious advantage of Ethereum restaking for a validator is the ability to compound staking rewards by staking ETH on other protocols.\n\nReducing the start-up cost of new protocols: By restaking Ethereum\u2019s pool of assets, new protocols can benefit economically from Ethereum\u2019s security offerings without starting their validation services.\n\nProtocols can retain sovereignty: By building on EigenLayer, protocols will have the flexibility to customize their architecture without adhering to the rigid rules imposed on Ethereum Layer 2 chains.\n\nCons\n\nSlashing: When you stake ETH, you are exposed to slashing as an economic consequence of bad behavior. Staking amplifies the risk, and you could lose staked ETH if you engage in malicious activity on a secondary protocol.\n\nRisk to Ethereum performance: Restaking opponents fear that with Ethereum\u2019s computational power being redirected to secondary networks, there could be a computational overload on Ethereum\u2019s consensus.\n\nCentralization risks: Restaking protocols like EigenLayer may attract ETH stakers with the promise of high yields, resulting in the rise of centralized networks and a decline in individual ETH stakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile still in its early stages, Ethereum restaking is an interesting approach to network security and validation and how users can actively contribute to both.\n\nEthereum restaking may set the precedent on how blockchain protocols incorporate the power of collective participation and pooled economic incentives to shape the future of decentralized finance."

        "content": "Ethereum price is attempting a recovery wave above the $2,240 zone. ETH could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2,300 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum started an upside correction above the $2,200 zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,240 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,265 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair might start a steady increase if it clears the $2,300 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Regains Strength\n\nEthereum price formed a base and started a recovery wave above the $2,220 resistance zone. ETH cleared the $2,240 resistance zone like Bitcoin to move into a short-term bullish zone.\n\nHowever, the bears were active near the $2,300 zone. A high was formed at $2,307 before there was a pullback. The price declined below the $2,280 level. It broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $2,170 swing low to the $2,307 low.\n\nThe bulls are now active above the $2,240 support and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $2,170 swing low to the $2,307 low. Recently, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,265 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $2,240 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the first major resistance is near the $2,280 level. The next major resistance is near $2,300, above which the price might rise and test the $2,350 resistance.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIf the bulls push the price above the $2,350 resistance, they could aim for $2,420. A clear move above the $2,420 level might start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,550 level.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,300 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,240 level.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,220 zone. A daily close below the $2,220 support might start another major decline. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,170 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,120 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,220\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,300\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Sei Labs is rolling out an upgrade that it hopes will attract Ethereum developers.\n\nHowever, it is not the only layer 1 competing in the crowded market.\n\nSei Labs, the company behind the layer 1 blockchain Sei, is betting on its Sei v2 upgrade to attract developers and remove barriers for those looking to deploy DeFi protocols on its blockchain.\n\nIt will allow developers to deploy protocols from Ethereum \u2014 the biggest blockchain ecosystem with over $57 billion worth of DeFi deposits \u2014 on Sei without having to reconfigure their code.\n\n\u201cGoing to a new execution environment is very risky,\u201d Sei co-founder Jay Jog told DL News. \u201cIf you don\u2019t completely understand it, and you create even one small, tiny bug, that could result in your entire smart contract getting completely drained.\u201d\n\nInvestor deposits ($) in Sei, as measured by total value locked on DefiLlama\n\nSei v2 is scheduled to go live in the first half of 2024 and will remove that risk for developers, Jog said.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nSei Labs is betting that Ethereum developers will opt to build on faster blockchains like Sei as the industry is growing more focused on interoperability, referring to the push to connect disparate blockchain ecosystems.\n\nTapping into Ethereum\n\nEthereum is currently where the vast majority of blockchain development takes place. A recent report from Electric Capital found that 71% of smart contract code was initially deployed on Ethereum.\n\nAlthough Ethereum is the birthplace for the majority of blockchain code, developers also frequently opt to deploy their projects on alternative blockchains that boast higher speeds and reduced transaction fees.\n\nBlockchains like Solana or Cardano have had a hard time attracting Ethereum developers because they use software that is incompatible with Ethereum\u2019s. Solana uses its own custom-made solution, while Cardano uses a UTXO model.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThis has created an opportunity for Sei and similar projects looking to court Ethereum devs.\n\nNeon EVM, an Ethereum-compatible layer 2 blockchain built on top of Solana, and Monad, a yet-to-be-launched blockchain, also offer Ethereum developers routes to deploy their code on a more performant blockchain without having to make alterations to it.\n\n\u2018The EVM is here to stay\u2019\n\nCurrently, blockchains fall into one of two broad categories: those that are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine \u2014 or EVM for short \u2014 and those that are not.\n\nEVM-compatible blockchains make it easy for Ethereum developers to build on them, but many of those chains are prone to transaction congestion and high fees.\n\nWhile some EVM-compatible blockchains find a way around this using technologies like zero-knowledge proofs, such blockchains are still relatively new.\n\nOn the other hand, blockchains that use different software, like Sei and Solana, can achieve much higher transaction speeds.\n\nSei\u2019s answer to this situation is to upgrade its current architecture to make it fully compatible with Ethereum \u2014 a request that\u2019s at the top of developers\u2019 wishlist, Jog said.\n\n\u201cThe EVM is here to stay,\u201d Jog said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the cleanest and most elegant execution environment to be using, but it is the one that has already gotten most market share.\u201d\n\nSei currently requires developers to write their protocols using programming languages like Rust or C++. But after the Sei v2 upgrade, they will be able to use languages like Solidity and Vyper that are popular with Ethereum developers.\n\nEVM parallelisation\n\nSei already achieves high transaction speeds compared to other blockchains. To maintain these high speeds while also letting developers use the EVM, Sei is implementing a technique called EVM Parallelisation.\n\nThis allows Sei to run multiple execution environments that can simultaneously process transactions instead of having to process transactions one after the other, as most blockchains do.\n\nSei is not the only blockchain leveraging EVM Parallelisation.\n\nNeon EVM also uses EVM Parallelisation to let Ethereum developers tap into Solana.\n\nInvestors deposits ($) in Neon, as measured by total value locked on DefiLlama\n\nBut unlike Sei v2, where both EVM and non-EVM protocols will live on the same blockchain, Neon EVM is its own separate blockchain.\n\nThat means users must first bridge their assets to Neon EVM, introducing a point of friction, which hasn\u2019t prevented Neon from making inroads with Ethereum developers.\n\nStiff competition\n\nAave, the biggest lending protocol on Ethereum with over $7 billion worth of investor deposits, recently polled its token holders on whether it should deploy its v3 version to Neon EVM. The vote ended with over 83% of token holders signalling support.\n\nMonad, a soon-to-be-launched blockchain, is also promising developers EVM compatibility and fast transactions.\n\nBoasting a proprietary consensus algorithm, Monad claims it will achieve processing capabilities of up to 10,000 transactions per second upon its launch later this year.\n\nAlthough Neon EVM has a head start, the competition between these three EVM Parallelisation projects is only just beginning.\n\nSEI token price ($)\n\nSuccess isn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018if you build it, they will come,\u2019\u201d Jog said. \u201cBecause there\u2019s been dozens of other chains where no one has gone.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Sei Labs\u2019 focus on parallelisation, the Sei Foundation, an affiliated nonprofit that supports the Sei ecosystem, plans to launch a grants programme for those looking to develop on the Sei blockchain."

Earlier this month, the bank said the approval could come after the November 2024 election.\n\n\"We do not expect the SEC in 2024 to approve a spot Ethereum ETF,\" TD Cowen Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg, wrote in a note on Monday. \"This is a political call. We believe there is no upside for SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve a spot Ethereum ETF given how upset progressive Democrats were over the agency's approval of a spot bitcoin ETF earlier this month.\"\n\nGensler needs the support of progressives to push forward his agenda in this election year, according to TD Cowen. Also, if Gensler pursues a different role, such as Treasury secretary, in the event of President Joe Biden winning a second term, he will still need the backing of progressives, the bank said.\n\nSo, \"there is no reason to provoke a needless fight,\" TD Cowen said. \"We say needless, as our view remains that Gensler is in no hurry to approve an Ethereum ETF as he would first like more experience with the performance of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. This is consistent with his broader approach to crypto, which is to move incrementally and slowly when it comes to providing regulatory approvals or clarity.\"\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF applications\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nMore than half a dozen companies, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have applied for a spot Ethereum ETF. Last week, the SEC again postponed its decision on Grayscale Investments' proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF, following delays on other applications earlier this month.\n\nThe SEC can take its time reviewing spot Ethereum ETF applications, according to TD Cowen. \"It can eventually reject the rule change, which either will lead to a new application or litigation. Either will take another year or two to play out,\" the bank said.\n\nThe expected late 2025 or early 2026 approval deadline is possible even if Congress fails to enact broader crypto market structure legislation in 2025, TD Cowen said.

While the SEC must make a final decision on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ether (ETH) ETF decision by Aug. 7, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has predicted a final decision will be made on all pending spot Ether ETFs in May \u2014 similar to the way the SEC decided on 10 pending spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in January.\n\nThe next day, the SEC also delayed its decision on whether to approve a spot Ether ETF from Grayscale Investments, opening the application to public comments. The SEC said it would institute proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove a proposed rule change allowing NYSE Arca to list and trade Grayscale Ethereum Trust shares. Opening the proposed investment vehicle to public comment will push the deadline for a decision by an additional 35 days upon publication in the Federal Register.\n\nThe SEC remains one of the most consistently anti-crypto forces in the United States.

FINRA reviewed over 500 crypto asset-related retail communications starting in November 2022. According to the regulator, it identified more than 70% of the reviewed communications that had \u201cpotential substantive violations\u201d of its rules on communications with the public.\n\nAccording to the regulator, crypto-related communications could range from a podcast to an ad spot in the Super Bowl. Violations potentially included misleading claims on crypto and misrepresenting how the protections of federal securities laws apply to digital assets. FINRA added that the targeted exam provided crypto firms with questions to consider in their public communications.\n\nContinue reading\n\nFlorida and Alaska revoke Binance.US\u2019s right to operate in their territories\n\nTroubled cryptocurrency exchange Binance.US continues to face pressure from regulators in the U.S. after the former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao\u2019s guilty plea. Regulators in Florida and Alaska have told Binance.US that the crypto exchange can no longer serve its residents. The Alaska Division of Banking and Securities reportedly denied renewing Binance.US\u2019s license in January 2024. Florida\u2019s Office of Financial Regulation has also issued an emergency suspension order against Binance.US\u2019s money transmitter license.

        "content": "Mustafa has been writing about Blockchain and crypto since many years. He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nStory Highlights Analyst Benjamin Cowen predicts a potential value drop below $1,000 based on historical patterns and the ETH/BTC pair.\n\nBitcoin's performance significantly impacts Ethereum.\n\nPotential approval of Ethereum ETFs in March could boost its price, but the wait-and-see approach remains.\n\nWell, this could come as bad news for many! Benjamin Cowen, a respected analyst, has raised a red flag regarding Ethereum\u2019s future compared to Bitcoin. Widely recognized for his precise predictions, Cowen recently shared crucial insights on YouTube, pointing towards a potential downturn in Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nAt present, Ethereum is cautiously navigating around $2,297, reflecting a modest 0.33% dip in the last 24 hours.\n\nBut what\u2019s coming next? Read on to find out.\n\nCowen\u2019s Bearish Analysis\n\nIn a recent video, Benjamin Cowen, known for his accurate crypto predictions shared his thoughts about Ethereum (ETH), he believes that Ethereum\u2019s value might drop a lot, possibly below $1,000 before entering into a bullish period.\n\nCowen looks at how Ethereum has behaved in the past and sees a historical pattern where it usually goes down, then a bit up, and then down again. This makes him think that Ethereum might still have to go down again before things get better.\n\nKey Indicator to Focus On\n\nCowen emphasizes the importance of the ETH/BTC pair, warning that a breakdown could lead to a significant drop in Ethereum\u2019s USD value. Historical data supports this correlation.\n\nThat\u2019s why Cowen predicts that Ethereum might go back to low values below $1,000, especially if the ETH/BTC pair breaks down.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Price Prediction For This Week\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin\u2019s Impact\n\nHighlighting the symbiotic relationship between Ethereum and Bitcoin, Cowen predicts that a surge in Ethereum\u2019s value hinges on a preceding uptick in Bitcoin. The gravitational pull of Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics significantly shapes Ethereum\u2019s journey.\n\nAcknowledging the inherent unpredictability of predictions, Cowen factors in variables such as the Ethereum spot ETF and Bitcoin halving narratives. He emphasizes the intricate nature of market dynamics, recognizing their role in shaping Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nCould An ETF Help?\n\nWhile Cowen urges caution, optimism surrounds the prospect of Ethereum\u2019s price surge if the SEC greenlights spot Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock\u2019s extension and other major players, including VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, and Hashdex, submitting ETF proposals, with decisions looming by March 10 and deadlines ranging from May to July, add layers of anticipation.\n\nRead More: Approval for Ethereum ETFs Coming Soon? Key Challenges You Should Know\n\nAs Ethereum stands at a crossroads, Cowen\u2019s insights raise crucial questions about its future trajectory. Will Ethereum weather the storm, or will regulatory decisions reshape its path? We\u2019re all waiting and watching."

He has been studying cryptocurrencies and their market behavior for several years and deeply understands the factors that affect the price of cryptocurrencies. His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nAnalyst Crypto World has opened up about the current state of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The analyst discussed the key technical indicators and potential scenarios for each cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price bounces between $37,900 and $38,500 from a crucial support level. The analyst pointed out a bearish divergence still present on the daily chart, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has not yet broken above a descending resistance line. However, the possibility of a bullish reversal is hinted at by the potential formation of a bullish cross in the daily MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence).\n\nWhile the bearish divergence is technically active, the analyst expressed neutrality in the short term. In the immediate short term, the 2-hour Bitcoin chart displayed a breakout above resistance levels between $41,700 and $42,200. The analyst expected support in this range and warned that a confirmed break below $41,700 could lead to a potential downturn toward $39,500.\n\nEthereum\n\nThe analyst observed that Ethereum Price is still under a bearish divergence on the daily chart. Despite this, the daily MACD indicated a reduction in bearish momentum, suggesting a more neutral outlook in the short term.\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the analyst identified a potential short-term bullish scenario, comparing the current price structure to a historical fractal. The possibility of a slight bullish relief or sideways consolidation was mentioned, with a watchful eye on potential outflows from Grayscale influencing the market.\n\nSolana\n\nThe Solana price analysis focused on the 8-hour timeframe, where the price encountered resistance around $98 to $99. The analyst pointed out potential resistance levels at $102.50 and $108 to $109. A breakout above $99 and a rejection at $102 to $103 could lead to an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, indicating a bullish trend reversal. Support levels were identified at $91 to $92 and $83.50 to $85.50."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Ethereum's position as a frontrunner in the altcoin sector, its growth has been stunted by a bearish trend that has held a tight grip on the market in recent weeks. A closer look at the ETH chart reveals that the expected volatility spike that could catalyze a bullish reversal has yet to materialize.\n\nLayer-2 network adoption and ecosystem expansion\n\nFirst, the surge of layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism could be a catalyst for Ethereum's growth. These networks aim to enhance Ethereum's ecosystem by providing the much-needed scalability and reduced fees, potentially driving renewed interest and increased adoption of the Ethereum network.\n\nETH/USD Chart by TradingView\n\nScalability and network efficiency\n\nSecond, Ethereum's persistent scalability issues must be addressed. Despite the implementation of EIP-1559, which was anticipated to make transaction fees more predictable, the network still struggles under high demand, leading to exorbitant fees and reduced network functionality. Resolving these scalability woes is crucial, as a more efficient and cost-effective network is vital for Ethereum to retain its value and utility.\n\nIntroduction of Ethereum ETF\n\nFinally, the establishment of an Ethereum ETF would be a strong bullish signal, mirroring the impact of the Bitcoin ETF. An Ethereum ETF would pave the way for institutional investment, providing a regulated and accessible means for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH. This could secure Ethereum's future as a mainstream financial asset and provide a stable foundation for long-term growth.\n\nLooking at the Ethereum chart, we identify a local resistance level at approximately $2433.5, a price point that has acted as a hurdle in recent trading sessions. For a bullish case to solidify, Ethereum needs to break past this resistance with conviction. Should this occur, it could signal a shift in investor sentiment and open the path to higher price levels."

Discover SCENE\n\nToken trading on Solana decentralized exchanges briefly flipped that of Ethereum exchanges in December as meme coin mania raged, and now it\u2019s happened again\u2014this time ascribed to an impending token airdrop.\n\nAs of Sunday night, rolling 24-hour trading volume on Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXes) topped Ethereum exchanges, according to data from DeFi Llama, with about $705 million on Solana during the span compared to $698 million on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum is back on top as of this writing, but the networks remain close: DeFi Llama shows about $742 million in Ethereum DEX trading over the last 24 hours, while Solana remains steady right around $705 million. Ethereum is well ahead in terms of seven-day volume, however, at $8.9 billion compared to less than $4.5 billion for Solana.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven so, the recent short-lived reversals show that the long-dominant Ethereum is facing increasing pressure from Solana, as the rival chain offers much cheaper and faster transactions. That was the case in December when trading on Solana meme coins like BONK and Dogwifhat (WIF) helped spike DEX volume.\n\nNow, the culprit appears to be the impending launch of JUP, the official token of the popular Solana decentralized exchange aggregator Jupiter. It\u2019s set to debut on Wednesday with nearly a million wallets eligible to claim a share of JUP tokens.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, Solana trading volume on Jupiter topped that of leading Ethereum DEX Uniswap V3 late Sunday, though much like with the broader chains, those places have already swapped as of Monday morning.\n\nUniswap V3 has over $629 million worth of trading volume over the past 24 hours, while Jupiter has about $571 million in DEX trading on Solana during that span.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether any recent trading will actually factor into Jupiter airdrop eligibility, however, as the protocol took a snapshot of early users on November 2. It said that some 955,000 wallets would be eligible for the eventual drop, which is now set to take place on Wednesday. However, Jupiter has additional tokens planned for future airdrops.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJupiter\u2019s launchpad was used for last week\u2019s WEN meme coin drop as a test run ahead of the JUP drop. More than a million wallets were eligible for the WEN airdrop, though the claim only lasted until Monday morning\u2014with over 280 billion WEN left unclaimed.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Surpasses $42,000 Resistance and ETH Turns Red\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to be the key players with their recent price movements catching the attention of investors. Bitcoin, the trailblazer of the crypto market, has recently rebounded, breaking through the $42,000 resistance level and registering a current price of $42,292. This nearly 0.50% increase in the last 24 hours coincides with the overall crypto market valuation at $1.63 trillion, despite a slight 0.15% drop.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s surge is linked to favorable stock market trends and the significant achievement of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETFs amassing over $2 billion in Assets Under Management. This bullish trend in Bitcoin\u2019s price is a focal point for price prediction analyses.\n\nOn the other side, Ethereum, the second most notable cryptocurrency, has seen a minor setback, trading at $2,269 with nearly 0.50% decline. However, the buzz around the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, as suggested by analyst James Seyffart, signals an optimistic future for Ethereum. The approval, expected in May, could attract more investment, influencing Ethereum\u2019s price positively.\n\nMoreover, the global interest in cryptocurrencies is evident with developments like Harvest Hong Kong\u2019s application for a Bitcoin ETF and a Binance survey revealing growing crypto acceptance in Europe. These factors collectively contribute to the evolving narrative of Bitcoin and Ethereum price predictions.\n\nHarvest Hong Kong\u2019s ETF Bid: A Global Boost for Bitcoin\u2019s Value\n\n\n\nHarvest Hong Kong, a prominent Chinese fund company, has officially submitted an application for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.\n\nThe approval of this ETF, which is poised for launch after the Lunar New Year holiday on February 10, would mark Hong Kong\u2019s first Bitcoin spot ETF. This initiative follows the successful introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, igniting worldwide interest.\n\nRachel Aguirre of BlackRock has acknowledged the impressive performance of the U.S. ETF, which has surpassed expectations. China\u2019s entry into this sector adds a significant dimension to the dynamic landscape of digital asset investments, signaling a transformation in investor preferences.\n\nThus, Harvest Hong Kong\u2019s application for a Bitcoin ETF reflects increasing global interest. Its potential approval could further elevate Bitcoin\u2019s price by attracting additional investors and reinforcing its legitimacy in mainstream financial markets.\n\nBinance Report: Rising Crypto Acceptance in Europe and Bitcoin\u2019s Prospects\n\n\n\nBinance\u2019s latest survey reveals an increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Europe, driven by their potential for high returns, decentralization, and continuous innovation. The study indicates that 73% of Europeans hold a positive view of digital currencies, with 55% utilizing them for regular transactions. This trend aligns with the global increase in cryptocurrency ownership, which soared from 432 million in January to 580 million by December 2023.\n\nSome really positive findings from our #Binance survey across Europe. 73% of respondents were optimistic about the future of crypto & with MiCA implemented soon, there\u2019s a lot to be excited about in the region! More details from @Finbold here \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/gE3l6e5MtT \u2014 Rachel Conlan (@RachelConlan) January 25, 2024\n\nDespite a temporary decline in adoption following the FTX exchange issues in late 2022, confidence rebounded, partly due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs. High-profile sponsorships, including Crypto.com\u2019s collaboration with the LA Lakers and OKX\u2019s partnership with Manchester City, further enhanced trust in the sector.\n\nAs a result, the optimistic sentiment in Europe, highlighted by Binance\u2019s survey, may positively impact Bitcoin\u2019s price. The growing adoption, coupled with heightened optimism and usage, could attract more investors, potentially elevating the cryptocurrency\u2019s market value.\n\nSeyffart\u2019s Forecast: Ethereum ETF Approval in May Could Elevate ETH Value\n\n\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart sees a 60% chance of a spot Ethereum ETF getting approved in May. Despite recent delays for BlackRock and Grayscale proposals, Seyffart marks May 23 as a crucial date, expecting the SEC\u2019s decision around that time. The SEC, having approved Bitcoin ETFs, is now considering proposals from BlackRock, Grayscale, Ark 21Shares, and VanEck.\n\nThe Road Ahead: A View on ETH Spot This is intended to be a deep dive into the current landscape for crypto spot ETFs generally with emphasis on ETH. Will do this in 4 parts for ease of reference. 1 \u2013 General Roadmap\n\n2 \u2013 Threshold Issue\n\n3 \u2013 BTC Spot Approval\n\n4 \u2013 ETH Analysis\n\n\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) January 25, 2024\n\nSeyffart is hopeful but acknowledges the SEC\u2019s ability to delay decisions. Grayscale aims for a summer 2024 SEC decision on turning its Ethereum Trust into an ETF. As May approaches, Seyffart keeps an eye on filings, with May 23 as a key date for potential updates. Consequently, the prospect of a spot Ethereum ETF approval, highlighted by James Seyffart, could positively impact ETH price.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nAs of January 29, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC/USD) technical analysis on the 4-hour chart underscores critical price points crucial for its short-term movement. The pivot point is set at $42,161, confronting immediate resistance at $43,394. Additional resistance levels are observed at $44,372 and $45,581. In contrast, the support levels are at $40,957, $39,644, and $38,618. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads at 70, reflecting robust buying interest that is nearing overbought territory. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is located at $40,820, providing a key support line. A significant pattern on the chart is Bitcoin\u2019s ascend past a double top near the $42,160 region. A sustained closure above this level could be indicative of a strong upward trend. Thus, Bitcoin\u2019s trend remains bullish as long as it stays above the $42,160 threshold. Ethereum Price Prediction As of January 29, Ethereum (ETH/USD) continues to hover around the $2,250 mark, demonstrating a phase of consolidation. The 4-hour chart sheds light on essential levels that are shaping Ethereum\u2019s immediate market behavior. Its pivot point is identified at $2,321, facing immediate resistance at $2,388. Further resistance levels are located at $2,476 and $2,560. Conversely, Ethereum finds its initial support level at $2,241, followed by $2,169 and $2,102. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 54, suggesting a balanced market condition. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $2,314, reflecting a close alignment with Ethereum\u2019s current price movement. Technical analysis indicates that Ethereum has achieved a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,313. However, a descending trendline near the $2,300 level could act as an obstacle to any potential upward progression. In summary, Ethereum\u2019s trend appears bullish above the $2,320 level. Short-term expectations include testing the resistance at $2,388, offering essential insights for traders and investors monitoring Ethereum\u2019s market trends."

        "content": "Jupiter, a Solana-based liquidity aggregator and decentralized exchange (DEX), has witnessed a significant increase in trading volumes, as the platform prepares for the issuance of its native token, JUP.\n\nThe increase in volume suggests that traders are positioning themselves to benefit from the Jan. 31 JUP airdrop. An airdrop is a method commonly used in the cryptocurrency space to distribute tokens to users, often to encourage adoption and usage of a new platform or currency.\n\nThe Solana ecosystem competes with other blockchains like Ethereum for dominance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nSolana\u2019s total value locked (TVL), or the amount of crypto assets deposited in DeFi platforms, stood at US$1.40 billion at the time of writing, making it the fifth-largest DeFi chain in the world, according to DeFiLlama data. Ethereum hosts the world\u2019s largest DeFi ecosystem with US$31.4 billion in TVL.\n\nTrading activity on Jupiter has been comparable to that seen on established platforms like Ethereum-based Uniswap, currently ranked as the world\u2019s largest DEX with US$4.1 billion in TVL.\n\nSolana is also the world\u2019s second-most active blockchain for NFTs, with US$4.8 billion in all-time sales behind Ethereum\u2019s US$42.4 billion.\n\nIn December, Solana\u2019s US$365.48 million barely edged Ethereum\u2019s NFT sales volume of US$363.45 million.\n\nSolana\u2019s native token SOL is the world\u2019s fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization with US$43.8 billion.

        "content": "Ethereum, the cornerstone of decentralized finance and the second-largest coin by market cap, is currently trading above $2,250. To reach our Ethereum price prediction of $10,000, the price of ETH would need a 5x increase. Is this feasible in 2024? Let\u2019s analyze \ud83d\ude09\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment in 2024?\n\nIn 2024, Ethereum remains a strong investment option. Its position as a leader in the DeFi space and its consistent performance, despite market fluctuations, make it a viable choice for long-term investors. The potential for growth, as indicated by various chart analyses, suggests a promising future for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Merge was NOT Enough\n\nInterestingly, the price of ETH dropped post-Merge, an event that was technically significant but had a limited immediate impact on price. This underscores the importance of understanding market psychology and the difference between short-term trading and long-term investing in Ethereum.\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Buy?\n\nEthereum is considered a good buy, especially for those looking at long-term investments. Its robust fundamentals, coupled with a growing ecosystem, make it a standout in the crypto market. Investors should, however, be aware of market dynamics and invest wisely.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Will ETH Reach $10,000 in 2024?\n\nOur Ethereum price prediction analysis, based on charting techniques, suggests that while ETH reaching $10,000 in 2024 might be ambitious, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility. The key price point to watch in 2024 is $3,300, as surpassing this level could signal the start of an accelerated uptrend towards our target.\n\nEthereum price history chart in USD \u2013 coinmarketcap\n\nHowever, the $10,000 looks like a far target as this means a 5x from current prices.. Since Ethereum is strongly correlated to Bitcoin, this means that Bitcoin would reach around $200,000, which is a target beyond 2024.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum in 2024?\n\nEthereum can be purchased on various exchanges, with Bitget being a notable option. Bitget offers a user-friendly platform with robust security measures, making it an excellent choice for buying and trading Ethereum. Additionally, Bitget fees are one of the lowest in the market, so you won\u2019t have to worry about high fees if you trade regularly.\n\n\u2013> CLICK HERE TO BUY ETH <\u2013\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

The revelation came from the CEO of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Richard Teng , who shared the news on his X page.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeng expressed his gratitude for the privilege of hosting Buterin.\n\nIt was a privilege to have @VitalikButerin visit the #Binance office!\n\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to connect and talk to our team in person \ud83d\ude4f pic.twitter.com/PYrpX0HXsQ \u2014 Richard Teng (@_RichardTeng) January 29, 2024\n\nThe impromptu meeting sparked a flurry of speculation within the crypto community, as enthusiasts and experts alike pondered the potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. Notably, Binance has been grappling with heightened regulatory scrutiny in recent months, leading to the legal predicament of its former CEO, Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao.\n\nVitalik and Binance connections\n\nThis unexpected rendezvous holds significance, given Buterin and Binance's history of active collaboration, such as Buterin's contribution to the proof-of-reserves concept for centralized crypto exchanges just two years ago. Against the backdrop of Binance's $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges, the nature of the discussions between Buterin and the Binance team remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nVitalik Buterin's recent focus, as evident in his essay titled \"Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,\" centers on security, privacy and scalability. Notably, he addressed concerns about centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking \u2014 a topic that adds fuel to the speculation of potential collaborative efforts between Buterin and Binance.\n\nAs the crypto community eagerly awaits further developments, the surprise visit has sparked intense discussions about the future direction of these industry heavyweights."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is continuing to evolve.\n\nIncredibly enough, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is now 15 years old; the original digital currency kicked off back in 2009. And as the industry matures, change inevitably comes for the industry.\n\nThe big cryptocurrency investment strategy for this year is the rise of institutional capital. With the advent of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), large financial firms can now safely deploy capital into Bitcoin with the click of a button. ETFs also allow individual investors to readily access the Bitcoin market from their tax-sheltered retirement accounts. This change opens up a new frontier for digital assets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrypto to Buy: Bitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nUp trend Technical graph of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in futuristic concept, BITI ETF is a Bitcoin short fund for investors betting against Bitcoin.\n\nSource: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC dramatically changed the cryptocurrency game. On January 11th, the SEC approved the trading of 11 different ETFs devoted to Bitcoin. Those included funds such as iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (NYSE:BTCO), which have attracted substantial amounts of investor capital since launching a few weeks ago.\n\nUp until January 2024, investors had much more limited access to Bitcoin on American stock exchanges. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEARCA:GBTC) was operating as a trust but could only trade on the Pink Sheets. Previously, the SEC blocked Grayscale\u2019s petition to convert itself into an ETF.\n\nNow, though, Grayscale has been able to become an ETF, and that fund conversion has ushered in the approval of all other sorts of digital asset ETFs as well. With Bitcoin being the oldest and most well-known crypto, it stands to gain the lion\u2019s share of new capital flowing into the industry.\n\nCrypto to Buy: Ethereum (ETH-USD)\n\nCrypto currency etherium. ethereum coin on exchange charts. e-currency Ethereum. Ethereum price predictions\n\nSource: viktoryabov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) should be the next cryptocurrency in line to benefit from this trend. The SEC is expected to rule on whether or not it will approve Ethereum ETFs later this spring. Some analysts are hopeful this could lead to a major rally in the price of ETH.\n\nStory continues\n\nBears might contend that cryptocurrency prices initially sold off in the wake of the Bitcoin ETF approvals, which is true. However, in that case, the Grayscale Bitcoin fund already had a large sum of capital in it, and once the ETFs were approved, a large chunk of money was transferred out of that GBTC product into other funds with lower expense ratios.\n\nWith that shift largely taken care of, future inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs should be a net positive for the ecosystem and support higher prices. In any case, there is not much money in Ethereum trusts; an Ethereum ETF would tap a more unclaimed market, potentially leading to significant upside later this year.\n\nCrypto to Sell: Floki Inu (FLOKI-USD)\n\nFloki Inu price predictions. An image of a corgi wearing a horned viking helmet above text saying Floki Inu on a black background.\n\nSource: Zie Project/ShutterStock.com\n\nThere is a flip side to the cryptocurrency investment strategy centered around capturing these institutional capital flows.\n\nThe arrival of all these big-name asset managers like BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) in the ETF space is that cryptocurrency is a more serious endeavor now. And in attracting this more professional class of investors, the overall digital asset landscape changes.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen more speculative parts of the crypto landscape, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), lose popularity. Meme coins are likely to be another loser during this shift.\n\nTake Floki Inu (FLOKI-USD) for example. The coin is one of the various meme tokens to emerge riding off the popularity of Dogecoin (DOGE-USD). However, given Floki Inu\u2019s high transaction tax, limited visibility and minimal utility, it seems Floki Inu will not have a promising future.\n\nIn the wild west days of crypto, meme coins with little more than social media support could enjoy significant popularity. With the rise of ETFs and institutional money in crypto, however, unproven oddities such as Floki Inu are likely to fall by the wayside as the smart money concentrates in the most promising tokens and projects.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Ethereum price prediction: Over the past two weeks, the smart contract giant Ethereum has witnessed aggressive correction in its native token ETH. The coin price plunged from a $2714 high to a recent low of $2171, registering a 20% loss. However, as the broader market witnessed renewed buying pressure, the Ethereum price managed to hold its ground above $2200. As the development of ETH ETF gains attention from market participants, the Ethereum price could find an opportunity to return on a recovery trend.\n\nDuring the last week, Ethereum\u2019s price fluctuated between $2,170 and $2,265, showcasing a tug-of-war between market bears and bulls. This pattern reflects a year of robust growth for Ethereum, with a notable 54% increase in value. This resilience is further underscored by a surge in trading volume, which reached a staggering $7.15 billion, reinforcing Ethereum\u2019s position as the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $271 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Recent Trends and Bullish Signals\n\nEthereum reached its peak value of $2,717 on January 12. Since then, it has mostly hovered around the $2,200 mark, indicative of a sideways movement in its price trend. These oscillations within a defined range suggest a mix of market strength and uncertainty. Crypto analysts are leaning towards a bullish short-term forecast for Ethereum, fueling optimism about its future performance in the market.\n\nCrypto analyst Crypto Tony has been closely monitoring Ethereum\u2019s price movements. His analysis suggests a forthcoming surge in Ethereum\u2019s market value. He notes a prevailing positive trend that could catalyze a substantial rally. According to Tony, should Ethereum maintain its crucial $2,100 support level, it may be on track for considerable financial growth.\n\nEthereum price analysis reveals a significant trend in its daily chart, marked by an ascending channel formation. This pattern has been a key indicator for investors. However, Ethereum\u2019s recent downturn has led to a break below the channel\u2019s support line. Additionally, Ethereum struggled against the resistance posed by the EMA 21 during its last uptrend, hinting at a potential short-term bearish scenario for the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Can ETH Sustain the Bullish Momentum?\n\nThe current support level at $2,200, reinforced by various technical indicators, forms a robust support zone. If Ethereum manages to sustain above this critical level, there\u2019s potential for a bullish surge. This upward movement could target the $2,400 mark. Beyond this, sustained bullish momentum could see ETH challenging higher resistance levels, potentially reaching $3,000 and possibly escalating to $4,000 by the end of February 2024.\n\nConversely, a drop below the pivotal $2,200 support level could trigger a downward trend for Ethereum. Such a decline could steer the price toward the lower support line near $2,120. If bearish forces continue to exert pressure, Ethereum might find its next support level around $2,000, potentially leading to a market correction.\n\nThe technical indicators for Ethereum are showing promising signs, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently positioned at 48. This figure, hovering just below the neutral 50 mark, suggests that buyers hold firm ground. The daily chart for Ethereum reflects a positive trend, particularly after it surpassed its 200-day moving average and moved out of a significant descending channel.\n\nMoreover, bullish signals are reinforced by the behavior of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). The MACD line\u2019s ascent above the signal line indicates growing bullish momentum, a sentiment echoed by the rising histogram. This bullishness is further bolstered by the upward movement of the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the crossing of the 50-day SMA over the 200-day SMA. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow indicator, currently at 0.01, resides in the positive zone, providing further evidence of a bullish market outlook for Ethereum.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Will Happen Very Fast -- Here Are The Coins to Buy Now - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin ($BTC) Spot ETFs has created a new precedent for digital assets having ETF products, and the Ethereum ($ETH) ETF will happen very fast. An Ethereum Futures ETF product already uses spot price as its base, making any argument against an approval nonsensical. BlackRock knows what it is doing, and an Ether Spot will be available later this year.\n\n\n\nNow is the right time to be bullish on Ethereum and Ethereum betas- these are the top cryptos to buy right now. Betas are smaller cap tokens whose performance is linked to a leading asset. Regarding Ethereum, here are the coins to buy now: $ETH, $ARB, $SNX, $OP, and $GFOX.\n\n\n\nGalaxy Fox ($GFOX) Ethereum Presale Beta\n\nGalaxy Fox is a hybrid meme/ P2E token and is an excellent play for anybody who is bullish on GameFi, memecoins, and Ethereum. Its unique positioning in dual narratives gives it tremendous upside potential, and the protocol itself has an excellent user acquisition model.\n\n\n\nIts Web3 runner game pays out prizes to skilled players, and anybody can compete. A new dimension is added with NFTs boosting in-game stats, and the ability to earn real money is a perfect incentive for new users to enter this ecosystem. Users stay for the staking rewards, and the protocol\u2019s token burn means they are earning yield on a deflationary asset.\n\n\n\nThis ICO launching in the Ethereum ecosystem while specualtive attention is focused here could easily produce a 100X run. $GFOX is a top crypto to buy now.\n\nEthereum ($ETH) Spot ETF Loading\n\nEthereum is the next narrative trade, and investors already have the playbook. Bitcoin was at $25,000 when Fink announced he had made an application for a Spot ETF. It rallied all the way to $48,000. Ethereum will do the exact same.\n\n\n\nBuying $ETH now has to be one of the most straightforward trades in the world. However, given $ETH\u2019s large market cap upside potential is certainly capped compared to the beta plays.\n\n\n\nArbitrum ($ARB) Leading Layer 2\n\n\n\nArbitrum ($ARB) is the leading layer two and is an easy beta play. $ARB\u2019s performance is heavily affected by $ETH\u2019s price, and if Ethereum rallies 5%, Arbitrum typically rallies 15%+.\n\n\n\nSet to benefit from the Dencun upgrade and the introduction of a new type of transaction known as a blob. Blobs will massively reduce the cost for rollup providers and end users. $ARB is one of the top 5 cryptos to invest in for anybody bullish long-term on Ethereum and the future of rollups.\n\n\n\nSynthetix ($SNX) Liquidity Provision King\n\n\n\nSynthetix ($SNX) is another of the top cryptos to buy right now, and this liquidity provision protocol is a crucial pick-and-shovel play. It is the backend for multiple protocols on Ethereum and Optimism, and a massive percentage of trading activity taking place on-chain feeds value back to $SNX stakers.\n\n\n\nOptimism ($OP) Rise of the OP Stack\n\n\n\nOptimism ($OP) is the second-largest rollup, and the propagation of the OP Stack, a modular framework for building rollups, promises to feed an incredible amount of value to $OP token holders.\n\n\n\nThey will control governance rights for all rollups constructed using the OP Stack, and the growing adoption of this tech standard increases Optimism\u2019s technological dominance. $OP is another top crypto to buy for anybody who is bullish on Ethereum and modular design.\n\n\n\nClosing Thoughts: Ethereum Uptrend Unlocks Huge Upside For Betas\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Spot ETF will happen sooner than investors think, and beta plays are the top cryptos to buy now. As $ETH becomes dominant and starts to outperform Bitcoin, it gives these smaller caps riding on its coattails enormous upside potential.\n\n\n\nAs per raw ROI potential, Galaxy Fox is leaps and bounds beyond its competition, and $GFOX launching in the current conditions is a clear path to a 100X rally. Participate in the presale today!\n\nLearn more about $GFOX here:\n\nVisit Galaxy Fox Presale | Join the Community"

        "title": "As Ethereum predictions turn bullish, what\u2019s next for prices? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum has a bullish structure on the weekly chart.\n\nThe two key range resistance levels overhead line up well with the liquidation heatmap.\n\nEthereum [ETH] bulls took over a month to breach the resistance at the $2.4k mark. The Bitcoin [BTC] spot ETF approval news took Ethereum to the local high at $2.7k, but was rejected from there.\n\nThis price action presented the idea of a range within a range, which AMBCrypto explores here. In the meantime, the weekly market structure remained bullish, with the $2.1k level being the higher low.\n\nThe $2370 resistance could rebuff ETH bulls\n\nThe one-week chart showed that the $2.5k to $2.7k zone was a resistance from May 2022. It had been a support zone in March 2022 but was later breached. In the past two weeks, it served as a supply zone.\n\nThe range (purple) for Ethereum extended from $2.1k to $2.6k, with the mid-range mark at $2370.\n\nThe lows of the range saw candlewicks on the daily chart venture below $2.2k, but these were quick to bounce upward. The past few days saw another such reaction.\n\nUntil the push above $2.4k, the mid-range could be considered a range by itself. The price action since then has shown that expanding the range highs made sense.\n\nTherefore, the $2.4k and $2.6k levels are likely to oppose ETH gains.\n\nThe RSI was below neutral 50 to reflect bearish momentum, but this could change. On the other hand, the OBV fell to the December highs.\n\nThe OBV appeared to move within a range, just like the price. This meant that the buyers and sellers had been equally strong over the past month.\n\nThe liquidation heatmap could give more clues\n\nThe one-day price action suggested that a bounce to $2.4k was likely. It also underlined that the $2150-$2200 region was a firm demand zone.\n\nData from Hyblock agreed with both these inferences that AMBCrypto drew from the price action chart.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe $2420-$2450 area was estimated to have close to $3 billion worth of liquidation levels.\n\nFurther north, the $2620-$2660 and $2750-$2800 regions were estimated to have $3.8 billion and $5 billion worth of liquidation levels respectively. This meant swing traders could book profits at these levels.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, crypto news you shouldn't miss - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 29 Jan 2024 \u25aa 9 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nAt the intersection of cutting-edge technology and economic fluctuations, the world of cryptocurrencies never fails to astonish us. This week, we witnessed a series of events that not only redefine the value and function of digital currencies but also their impact on our society and global economy. From the depths of the Mt. Gox affair to the heights reached by Solana, not to mention the imminent challenges of Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as the intrigues surrounding SHIB, each story is a thread in the complex labyrinth of crypto. Join us on this weekly journey as we unravel these threads to bring you a clear and precise understanding of the latest developments in this fascinating universe.\n\nBitcoin: The Storm Nears with the Distribution of 200,000 BTC from Mt. Gox\n\nIn 2014, the Bitcoin world was shaken by the hacking of Mt. Gox, one of the largest exchange platforms at the time. Today, after a decade of twists and turns, Mt. Gox is set to repay its creditors, marking a major turning point. This process will result in the release of 200,000 BTC into the crypto ecosystem. Recently, the mtgoxinsolvency subreddit has been buzzing following the receipt of emails requesting confirmation of identity and account details.\n\nThe announcement of the distribution by Mt. Gox comes at a time when Bitcoin, already below the $43,000 mark, seems to be on a tightrope. On the one hand, the threat of a crash induced by the massive sale of recovered BTC looms. On the other, a breeze of optimism is blowing thanks to the successful introduction of a Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock, signaling a new influx of capital. Investors remain suspended between hopes of gains and fears of losses, making the Mt. Gox distribution a potentially seminal event for Bitcoin\u2019s recent history.\n\nBitcoin Halving 2024: Miners Soon to Go Bankrupt?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving scheduled for March 2024 will cut miner rewards in half, a situation that could be catastrophic for many mining players if not offset by a price increase. In 2024, Bitcoin mining requires colossal technological means, with professional miners investing massively in high-performance computing equipment and spending huge amounts on electricity to power their mining farms. According to Cantor Fitzgerald, the average cost to produce a single bitcoin currently sits around $8,500.\n\nSo far, the bitcoin reward awarded for each validated block allowed many miners to partially offset these deficits. But after the 2024 halving, this reward will be halved, potentially falling to 3.125 BTC. Such a drastic reduction in income, without an equivalent increase in price, could spell doom for most mining companies. Only those with the most aggressive production costs might hope to continue creating value. The Cantor Fitzgerald report warns that without a substantial rise in the price of bitcoin, the halving could trigger a \u201ccrypto winter\u201d and a wave of bankruptcies, making mining economically unviable and threatening the decentralized integrity of the Bitcoin network.\n\nSolana Launches Token Extensions: A Sizeable Revolution!\n\nSolana recently announced the introduction of token extensions, heralding the dawn of a new era in the crypto space. These extensions are not mere additions but cornerstones of a structure aiming to revolutionize the SPL Token standard. They promise to turn security, compliance, and ease of use into tangible realities for businesses in the crypto sphere. Solana\u2019s token extensions introduce innovations such as transfer hooks, adjustable transfer fees, and confidential transfers, offering secure and compliant navigation in the crypto space.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, the visionary behind Solana Labs, sees these extensions as the essence of what makes Solana unique. Their potential for massive adoption is particularly captivating, and the Solana Foundation envisions a future where crypto businesses dive into Web3 with assurance. Furthermore, despite recent volatility, the SOL crypto shows signs of underlying strength that is impressively resilient.\n\nEthereum Developers Announce Major Update\n\nEthereum developers have announced the deployment schedule for Dencun, a crucial update aimed at improving performance and reducing transaction fees. This update will first be activated on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets, on January 30 and February 7 respectively, before its deployment on the mainnet. These testnet activations are essential to ensure a smooth transition to this new version of Ethereum. Tim Beiko, one of the lead developers, emphasizes the importance of these tests to validate the robustness of Dencun and prepare for its official launch.\n\nDencun continues the revolutionary work started by Shapella in 2023, integrating the \u201cEIP-4844\u201d update, better known as \u201cProtodanksharding.\u201d This advancement is expected to lead to a dramatic decrease in transaction fees for Ethereum-based layer 2 solutions, with an estimated reduction of 90% for protocols like Optimism or Arbitrum. This radical drop in costs promises to increase the accessibility and usage of the Ethereum blockchain, thus stimulating the emergence of new layer 2 innovations.\n\nMysterious Transfer of 420 Billion SHIB: Is The Hype Back?\n\nA massive transfer of 420 billion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens, worth $3.87 million, has recently puzzled crypto investors. On January 21, an anonymous investor transferred this astronomical sum of SHIB between two unidentified Ethereum addresses. The origin of the tokens, initially stored in a wallet associated with Coinbase Prime Custody\u2019s institutional custody solution, suggests possible involvement of professional investors. This transfer, of a rare magnitude, adds to the confusion and speculation surrounding the transaction.\n\nThis major movement of SHIB occurs shortly after a similar transaction was identified by Arkham Intelligence, involving large purchases of Shiba Inu by Robinhood. The SHIB price, which has recently dropped to its lowest level since early December 2023, shows signs of repurchase, hinting at a possible trend reversal. If the SHIB price manages to consolidate around its current level, some analysts estimate that a sustained crossing of the $0.00001 threshold could be feasible, potentially adding a bullish element to this scenario.\n\nOnly 5 Exchanges Control 98% of the Crypto Market in Euros\n\nA recent study by Kaiko reveals that only five exchange platforms control 98% of the total volume of crypto exchanges in euros. Among more than a dozen exchanges offering euro transaction services, Bitvavo, Kraken, Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Binance overwhelmingly dominate the market. This high concentration underlines the disparity in the distribution of market shares among crypto exchanges.\n\nEuropean traders have shown a marked preference for Bitcoin (BTC) in 2023, with exchange volumes exceeding 37 billion euros. In comparison, Ether (ETH) from Ethereum and Ripple\u2019s XRP recorded respective volumes of 15 billion euros and 9.5 billion euros. This dynamic highlights Bitcoin\u2019s preeminent crypto status.\n\nBitcoin Bonanza: Uncle Sam Prepares a Mega Sale of Silk Road\u2019s Crypto Treasury\n\nThe U.S. government is set to conduct a sensational sale of $130 million worth of bitcoins, seized in the course of the infamous Silk Road scandal. Silk Road, a virtual black market specialized in money laundering and drug trafficking, was shut down in 2013, but the confiscated bitcoins continue to haunt auctions. This sale undoubtedly represents a unique opportunity for bidders.\n\nThe seizure of 69,000 BTC related to the Silk Road case by the United States and the announcement of their imminent sale raise questions about the possibility of laundering a criminal past through government auctions. This situation shines a light on the moral dilemma surrounding the sale of seized goods from illegal activities.\n\nThat\u2019s the main news to remember for this week.

        "title": "Ether Price Will Crash Hard Below $1,000, Says This Popular Analyst - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBenjamin Cowen, a popular cryptocurrency trader-cum-analyst, has suggested that the price of Ethereum\u2019s native token ether (ETH) could experience further declines before finding a local bottom. Cowen expressed the possibility of ETH nosediving below the $1,000 level, attributing the potential dip to factors related to the asset\u2019s historical patterns.\n\nWill ETH Really Fall Below $1K?\n\nInvestors and traders have been closely watching ether\u2019s price in recent weeks since the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. The second-largest crypto set a new year-to-date high of $2,720 after the approvals, but it has since turned soft alongside the broader crypto market.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, analyst Benjamin Cowen has suggested that ETH historically \u201ctests the integrity\u201d of its major cycle lows roughly two times before proceeding into a new bullish phase. Cowen specifically spotlights 2015, 2016, and 2020 and confirms that another low in 2022 is yet to be revisited.\n\nAccording to the trader, ether will first break down in its Bitcoin confluence (ETH/BTC) in the coming months before ETH/USD follows.\n\n\u201cSo at some point, I think Ethereum will test the integrity of that low, back down below $1,000. But, history would also suggest that it won\u2019t test it until after ETH/BTC breaks down. And history also suggests that ETH/BTC probably won\u2019t break down in January because normally January is a good month for Ethereum,\u201d Bowen told his nearly 800,000 YouTube subscribers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the analyst noted that it could take some time before this scenario plays out amid increased speculation among investors about the possible introduction of a spot Ether ETF and Bitcoin\u2019s April halving event. According to experts, now that there is clarity after the Bitcoin ETFs, spot ETH ETFs may come sooner than expected.\n\nSpot ETH ETFs Aren\u2019t Far Away\n\nAs ZyCrypto previously covered, multiple companies including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest are seeking regulatory approval to set up spot ether exchange-traded funds. However, the SEC recently delayed the verdict for these investment products.\n\nAlthough such delays could subsequently delay a parabolic ETH rally, the SEC\u2019s approval ultimately will propel the price of the asset to new heights. With spot ETH ETFs, U.S. investors will access a regulated, tax-advantaged way of gaining exposure to the industry\u2019s second-biggest crypto.\n\nBesides the potential ETF, technical developments within the Ethereum ecosystem could also propel the ETH price. Notably, ETH devs recently set the timeline for the final Dencun testnet upgrades. Dencun will be run through the Sepolia test network on January 30, and on the Holesky testnet on Feb.7. This puts the upgrade on track to hit the mainnet in late February or early March."

Traders are likely holding on to their Ether, contributing to likely decrease in selling pressure.\n\nETH price could recover from its slump after 8% weekly losses for holders.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin bull run is likely sustainable, BTC balance on exchanges declines by over 1 million since 2020\n\nA quarter of Ethereum\u2019s supply is staked\n\nAccording to CryptoQuant data, staked Ethereum supply climbed to 29.37 million on January 28. This marks a new all-time high in terms of staked Ether supply since the launch of the deposit contract.\n\n\n\nEthereum: Total Value Staked. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nLeon Waidmann, editor and analyst at BTCEcho, notes that a quarter of Ethereum\u2019s supply is staked. The analyst comments on how this metric supports the bullish potential of ETH. The analyst identified that Ethereum\u2019s dwindling supply, strong base of holders and increasing trust could fuel the altcoin\u2019s gains in the ongoing cycle.\n\nA QUARTER of all #Ethereum is now STAKED!\n\n\n\nThat's not just a number - it's a MASSIVE vote of confidence in the long-term potential of #ETH!\n\n\n\nWhy's it bullish?\n\n\n\nIt means:\n\nLess supply on the market\n\nStrong HODLer base\n\nGrowing trust in #ETH's ecosystem pic.twitter.com/VpanirslUh \u2014 Leon Waidmann | On-Chain Insights (@LeonWaidmann) January 29, 2024\n\nAccording to Santiment data, the supply on exchanges has nosedived to 10.32 million, close to its six-month low. Typically, a decrease in exchange supply is equated with reduced selling pressure on the asset and room for price gains.\n\nEthereum supply on exchanges.

        "content": "How ICP steals the spotlight from Bitcoin and Ethereum: A Big Innovation in Blockchain. Raj Awasthi \u00b7 Follow 3 min read \u00b7 Jan 30, 2024 -- Listen Share\n\nSince we have introduced blockchain technology, we have explored what Bitcoin and Ethereum are. Now we have another blockchain product (ICP) that surely takes charge of its unlimited possibilities.\n\nIn the Bitcoin ecosystem, the objective was to develop a decentralized digital currency that facilitates security and immutability. Apart from this, the Ethereum ecosystem was more like a decentralized platform for the installation of dApps (decentralized applications), focusing on smart contracts and programmability.\n\nIn 2021, the ICP (the internet computer) entered the blockchain industry as the third invention of the blockchain that brought the concept of infinite blockchain and redefined the development of everything.\n\nPhoto by Pierre Borthiry - Peiobty on Unsplash\n\nIn this article, we\u2019re going to take a look at how ICP transforms the outlook of the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems.\n\nHow does ICP affect the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems?\n\nIntroducing Decentralized Identity (DID):\n\nWith the inclusion of a decentralized identity, it's now a much more secure approach to storing the data. Unlike traditional protocols, which have very few ways to provide identity and authentication,\n\nThis innovation provides the benefit of an extra identity layer to the users of Bitcoin and Ethereum for the sake of reducing fraud.\n\nSignificant evolution of smart contracts:\n\nAs the blockchain landscape is evolving, there is an important advancement in smart contracts. In ICP, canister smart contracts provide a reliable and secure alternative to Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts.\n\nWith the advancement of smart canisters, it may be beneficial for developers who want to create innovative applications on ICP that interact with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nEnabling remarkable interoperability:\n\nNot only Bitcoin integration but also ICP bridges the gap with Ethereum and fosters a seamless collaboration between the two ecosystems. This eliminates the need for bridges and achieves full decentralization.\n\nThis direct interface creates unparalleled opportunities for frictionless interactions between ICP and the Bitcoin blockchain, opening up new routes for decentralized applications.\n\nIncluding scaling capabilities and cost efficiency:\n\nUnlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, IPC comes with infinite scaling capabilities, as there are no limitations on transactions per second (TPS), which is 7 for Bitcoin and 15-20 for Ethereum. It's very important to have such an amazing scaling capacity, as it\u2019s very important for the future growth of ICP.\n\nThe cost efficiency of storing 1GB of data on ICP is approximately $5 per year, which is around $350,000,000 for Ethereum. This cost-effectiveness is one of the biggest reasons for the inclination towards ICP.\n\nSeamless integration with Bitcoin and Ethereum:\n\nThe Internet Computer (ICP) is altering the decentralized environment with its distinct set of features and capabilities. Through direct integration with Bitcoin, smooth interaction with Ethereum, and the ability to offer interactive web content directly to consumers, ICP envisions a future in which blockchain technology fulfills its full potential. Whether you're a consumer looking for a more accessible and user-friendly blockchain experience or an investor looking for game-changing companies, ICP provides an attractive opportunity to investigate the possibilities of decentralized innovation. Embrace the power of the Internet and start on the road toward a decentralized future.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThe third invention of blockchain technology holds an amazing future for integrating with other blockchain platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ICP takes an important step towards improving scalability, security, and, of course, transparency. With its optimum utilization, now we can build everything differently. As we all know, it's the era of the digital revolution, and blockchain is not an exception.\n\nHowever, it's also important to understand that ICP is still in the process of development, and with time, it will pave the way to building a whole different world along with proper governance of it.\n\nSo there you have it. If you have any suggestions for this post, feel free to join the discussion.\n\nThis is Raj Awasthi.\n\nSigning off!"
