Developed by Tom Lehman, the protocol allows for a cheaper and more decentralized minting process compared to conventional smart contract-based methods. Nearly 30,000 Ethscriptions have been created within the first 18 hours of the protocol going live, with users limited to image-only inscriptions for now. The project's launch garnered so much user activity that the API interface for the official Ethscriptions website temporarily crashed. It remains to be seen if Ethscriptions will achieve the same level of popularity as Bitcoin Ordinals, which has seen a surge in activity in less than six months."

        "summary": "  Ethereum's Cancun upgrade, set for autumn, will significantly benefit layer-2 rollup technologies like Arbitrum and Optimism. The upgrade, based on EIP 4844, introduces a new transaction type called \"blobs,\" which increases data and storage requirements for Ethereum blocks, creating a new fee market. This will allow rollups to process large amounts of data more efficiently, leading to a 100-fold increase in capacity. The upgrade does not improve Ethereum's scalability for executing transactions and smart contracts, but it reduces the cost of transferring large amounts of data to Ethereum, making it more cost-effective for rollups. Arbitrum (ARB) is at a crucial resistance level, with the potential to rise to mid-range resistance at $1.15 or face a price discovery to the downside."

        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) has seen a brief bullish rally after a period of correction, but the market remains uncertain. The price found support at a significant region comprising the 200-day moving average and the lower trendline of a flag pattern, which aligns with a static support level of $1.6K. However, the positive momentum weakened upon reaching the previous minor swing on the daily chart, leading to decreased volatility and small candles. The 4-hour chart shows that ETH reached a crucial Fibonacci level of 61.8% after breaking below the lower trendline of an extended ascending channel. The recent rebound could be a retracement towards the broken level, and the next move will depend on future price action. On-chain analysis shows that Ethereum's Exchange Netflow metric exhibited a downtrend during the consolidation correction phase, and the recent lawsuit involving Binance, Coinbase, and the SEC contributed to the bearish trend in the market. A robust and sustainable bullish rally is unlikely until fear and uncertainty disappear from the market and sufficient demand returns."
