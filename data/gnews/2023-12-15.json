        "title": "Ethereum Name Service now fully decentralized as DAO takes control - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has achieved decentralized governance, according to a message from the project\u2019s creator on Dec. 14.\n\nENS is a naming system for the Ethereum blockchain that adds human-readable names to various resources, including crypto wallets and websites. Until now, the project\u2019s root node was managed by members of the Ethereum community.\n\nNick Johnson, ENS founder, endorsed the change in ownership. He wrote on X:\n\n\u201c[This is] truly the end of an era. Here\u2019s the message I just sent to the ENS root keyholders, requesting the transfer of the last of their powers to the DAO.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s attached email stated that the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) of ENS, which is a governance group formed and controlled by ENS token holders, voted unanimously to acquire control of the project\u2019s root node.\n\nHe said that, in response to those voting results, he created a transaction to execute two actions that transfer root control to the DAO address (wallet.ensdao.eth). He wrote that this transaction transfers all remaining multisig responsibilities to the DAO, thereby \u201cretiring the multisig entirely.\u201d It is unclear whether the other multisig owners have approved the transaction.\n\nIndividuals who previously managed ENS\u2019 multisig include Chainlink\u2019s Sergey Nazarov, Metamask\u2019s Dan Finlay, MyCrypto\u2019s Taylor Monahan, Colony\u2019s Aron Fischer, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Jason Carver and Martin Swende, and Johnson himself. Johnson addressed those individuals in his message, writing: \u201cThank you so much \u2026 for your service to ENS over the years.\u201d\n\nENS governance will be more open\n\nENS\u2019 DAO is a governance group comprising token holders that vote on decisions and issues related to the project by staking tokens.\n\nAccording to the latest proposal, the DAO already has several ownership responsibilities but did not have control over the core ENS root name until now.\n\nThe DAO will gain specific capabilities by controlling the ENS root. The ownership change will allow the DAO to create, manage, and permanently lock top-level domains apart from the permanent and unchangeable .eth domain. It will also allow the DAO to update reverse resolutions that map addresses back to a name. The DAO may also introduce primary domain names on layer-2 networks.\n\nA snapshot indicates that voting concluded on Dec. 15, 2023. Virtually 100% of the staked tokens, or 1.9 million ENS, were staked in favor of DAO ownership. Johnson was one of the largest voters, staking 155,000 ENS in favor. Less than 17 ENS tokens were staked against the plan or were used to abstain."

Ethereum is known for its uses as a blockchain-powered, open-ended decentralized software platform and has risen 89.4% in value as of date in 2023.\n\nThe crypto behemoth has paved its path to winning over new customers by making a significant update this year, known as the Shanghai Upgrade. Under this upgrade, ETH shifted its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and marked one of the most significant developments in the relatively short history of cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the proof-of-stake system, miners of Ethereum will rely on Ether holders, who will act as validators, thus lending more assurance to the system.

There is a consensus that ETH might outperform BTC in 2024 with regard to growth rate and will gain more market share based on its proposals to reduce transaction costs and boost the number of transactions per second. In fact, its planned upgrade, called EIP-4844, might ensure that transaction costs could fall to as low as $0.01.\n\nPer Bitwise Asset Management, the world's largest crypto index fund manager, ETH revenues could double from 2023, up to $5 billion in 2024.

        "title": "JPMorgan Says ETH will Outperform Bitcoin: Will The Flippening Ever Happen? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum could do surpass Bitcoin in performance next year due to the upcoming Protodanksharding upgrade.\n\nThe JPM report says the potential impact of Bitcoin halving on its price is already factored into current valuations.\n\nJPMorgan analysts are stating that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs may not lead to a significant influx of new capital.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s crypto outlook for 2024 is marked by caution, particularly regarding Bitcoin (BTC). The financial institution perceives Bitcoin as being overbought, driven by what they consider \u201cexcessive optimism\u201d surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIts new report suggests Ethereum (ETH), currently the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, may surpass Bitcoin, the largest, in performance next year.\n\nProtodanksharding To Drive Ethereum\u2019s Growth\n\nThe report, authored by JPMorgan analysts including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglo, cites the anticipated Ethereum network upgrade, dubbed \u201cProtodanksharding ,\u201d as a key factor in this potential shift. This upgrade, expected in the first half of 2024, aims to significantly enhance the efficiency of the Ethereum network.\n\nAccording to the JPMorgan report, Protodanksharding is the primary catalyst for this expected outperformance. Analysts believe that this upgrade will be a significant step in improving the activity on the Ethereum network, thereby boosting its performance relative to Bitcoin.\n\nThe report also addresses the upcoming 2024 Bitcoin halving. It notes that current valuations already factor the potential impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price into their predictions.\n\nJP MORGAN EXPECTS ETH TO OVERSHADOW BTC AFTER PUBLIC CRYPTO SHADE Is JP Morgan\u2019s CEO having a change of heart? \u2013 JP Morgan analysts expect the forthcoming EIP-4844 upgrade or \u201cProtodanksharding\u201d to be immensely bullish for #Ethereum \u2013 \"Protodanksharding\" is essentially a\u2026 https://t.co/RZGGTqvsWj pic.twitter.com/Q6d3gjOGTj \u2014 BSCN (@BSCNews) December 15, 2023\n\nDespite speculations that the halving event would lead to a substantial price increase for Bitcoin, JPMorgan suggests that this is not a certainty and that Ethereum\u2019s advancements could position it for stronger performance in comparison.\n\nThe report said: \u201cGiven the current ratio of the Bitcoin price to production cost is around x2.0 at the moment, this would imply that the 2024 Bitcoin halving event is largely in the price.\u201d\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs May Not Boost Crypto Markets\n\nThe JPMorgan report presents a skeptical view on the potential impact of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nIt says the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), anticipated in 2024, may not lead to a significant influx of new capital into the crypto markets. This is based on observations from Europe and Canada, where the approval of spot crypto ETFs did not substantially increase investor interest or capital flow into the volatile Bitcoin or Ethereum markets.\n\nA few months ago, JP Morgan wasn't feeling Ethereum, and now they're singing a bullish tune. pic.twitter.com/1yPiiA9FSs \u2014 fity.eth (@Fityeth) December 14, 2023\n\nGrayscale ETF Woes Loom\n\nJPMorgan analysts believe that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs could redirect investments towards existing Bitcoin-related products. These include Bitcoin mining companies, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nThis conversion could lead to investors seeking to capitalize on the SEC\u2019s approval. This could result in up to $2.7 billion in losses for the Trust. Such a scenario is expected to exert \u201csevere downward pressure\u201d on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nPerfect timing for @JSeyff note today on why cash creates kill one \"superpower\" of ETFs, and how Grayscale would be hit hardest given they have sitting on tons of bitcoin they bought at lower prices that they'd have to sell. pic.twitter.com/3Uvji7mMya \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 14, 2023\n\nAdding to the cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed his negative view during a Senate banking committee hearing last week. Dimon stated his willingness to \u201cclose [crypto] down,\u201d indicating a strong skepticism towards the cryptocurrency market.\n\nDimon said: \u201cThe true use case for it [crypto] is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance, I\u2019ve always been opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, et cetera.\u201d"
