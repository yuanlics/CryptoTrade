        "summary": "  Ethereum restaking is gaining traction with the latest addition of Origin Ether (OETH) to EigenLayer, a tokenless restaking protocol. OETH is the second largest yield aggregator on Ethereum and will allow users to restake native staked ETH, LSTs, and ETH LP tokens on the platform. This will provide a solid foundation for protocol security and offer a unique opportunity for ETH stakers to compound their returns. However, restaking also carries additional risks, such as heightened slashing risks, and restakers are compensated for this risk in the form of rewards. EigenLayer is raising its deposit cap on restaked assets and will pause deposits if total LST deposits exceed 500K ETH. The integration of OETH with EigenLayer marks one of many milestones on OETH\u2019s quest to become one of DeFi\u2019s most integral money legos, and allows users to further compound their yield while participating in instruments at the forefront of blockchain innovation."
