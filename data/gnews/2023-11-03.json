        "title": "US seizes $54M worth of Ethereum linked to illegal narcotics business - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The assets in question were traced back to Christopher Castelluzo, who conducted narcotic operations from 2010 to 2015. While his illicit activities began in 2010, Castelluzo only transitioned to using Bitcoin (BTC) for narcotic transactions on darknets in 2013.\n\nCastelluzzo is currently serving concurrent 20-year federal and state prison sentences for drug distribution convictions.\n\n30k ETH bought at ICO\n\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is that Castelluzo initially acquired the 30,000 ETH during its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in July 2014, using 15 BTC stemming from his illegal narcotics business. At the time, the 30,000 ETH was worth a mere $9,000, but its current value has surged to more than $54 million as of press time.\n\nIn addition to Ethereum, Castelluzo also obtained 30,000 Ethereum Classic (ETC) in 2016, which he used to acquire other cryptocurrencies.\n\nSubsequent to his arrest and incarceration, Castelluzzo attempted to launder the 30,000 ETH while in prison. However, U.S. authorities foiled this scheme by intercepting recorded prison telephone calls in 2021, ultimately leading to the seizure of the assets.\n\nU.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger stated:\n\n\u201cThe civil action we are taking today seeks to recover millions of dollars of cryptocurrency, which the defendant allegedly obtained from drug sales. Whether it\u2019s as simple as bags of cash or as sophisticated as cryptocurrency, we will take the steps necessary to seize financial gains defendants obtain from criminal activity.\u201d\n\nJames E. Dennehy, the FBI Special Agent overseeing the case, emphasized that the forfeiture action serves as a warning to others involved in criminal activities. He added that the government is committed to holding criminals accountable for their actions."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Breaking This Confluence Resistance Could Spark Fresh Surge - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price corrected lower from the $1,875 zone against the US dollar. ETH retested the $1,780 zone and might soon attempt a fresh surge.\n\nEthereum holds the key support at $1,780 and $1,750.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a steep bearish trend line with resistance near $1,795 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a fresh increase toward the $1,850 and $1,875 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Revisits Uptrend Support\n\nEthereum attempted a fresh increase above the $1,850 resistance but upsides were limited, like Bitcoin. ETH traded as high as $1,874 and recently started a downside correction.\n\nThere was a move below the $1,850 and $1,820 levels. The price even spiked below the $1,800 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It retested the $1,780 support zone. A low is formed near $1,777 and the price is now attempting another increase.\n\nThere was a break above a steep bearish trend line with resistance near $1,795 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum is now trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $1,874 swing high to the $1,777 low.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,810 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The first major resistance sits at $1,825 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $1,874 swing high to the $1,777 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIf ETH surpasses the $1,825 resistance, it could again start a steady increase and test $1,875. The next key resistance is near $1,920, above which the price could accelerate higher toward the $2,0000 level. Any more gains might call for a move toward the $2,050 level.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,825 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,780 level or the recent low.\n\nThe next key support is $1,750. A downside break below the $1,750 support might spark a bearish wave. In the stated case, Ether could drop toward the $1,650 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,780\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,825\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Below $2,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite being up nearly 50% for the year, Ethereum (ETH 1.80%) seems to have fallen out of favor with investors. While other cryptos have been soaring in value of late, Ethereum has not. Currently trading at just under $1,800, Ethereum has repeatedly failed to surge past the $2,000 price mark this year and is now significantly underperforming Bitcoin (BTC 4.25%).\n\nAll of which makes Ethereum an intriguing investment right now. It's still the second-largest digital asset in the world (trailing only Bitcoin), and there are at least two good reasons Ethereum's price could start to move upward as we head into 2024.\n\nThe clear market leader\n\nFirst and foremost, Ethereum is still the 800-pound gorilla of the blockchain world. Ever since it pioneered the concept of smart contracts back in 2015, Ethereum has consistently been the first to market with just about every new blockchain innovation. And that has given Ethereum an enviable first-mover advantage in key areas such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nIn both areas, Ethereum is still the clear leader. For example, Ethereum is responsible for an eye-popping 54% of total value locked (TVL), arguably the single-best metric for measuring overall DeFi strength. No other blockchain even comes close.\n\nUntil rival blockchains, such as Solana or Avalanche, begin to chip away at Ethereum's market dominance at a faster pace, it's safe to say Ethereum will remain entrenched as the premier Layer 1 blockchain in the world. And that's exactly what I'm looking for in a long-term investment prospect: a clear market leader with an established track record of excellence.\n\nContinuous cycle of improvement\n\nEthereum's success to date has not been an accident. Ethereum boasts the largest developer network in the world, and these developers are highly focused on maintaining Ethereum's market-leading position. Case in point: Last year, Ethereum pulled off The Merge, one of the most difficult and complex technical achievements ever in the blockchain world. Some compared its difficulty to that of changing the engine of an airplane while mid-flight.\n\nWhat makes Ethereum particularly enticing to long-term investors is that it has a very detailed roadmap for future development. Even after The Merge, Ethereum has plans for new technical changes to its blockchain to boost performance, lower fees, and improve overall scalability. The next major upgrade (known as Dencun) is now tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2024 and has already received plaudits from Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhy has Ethereum fallen out of favor?\n\nSo the obvious question becomes, \"If Ethereum is so great, why has it fallen out of favor with investors?\" While there are several possible explanations, the most likely is that The Merge may have over-promised and under-delivered. There was so much buzz and speculation surrounding The Merge that it couldn't possibly live up to the hype.\n\nInvestors woke up the next day to find that nothing really seemed to have changed with the Ethereum blockchain. Transaction processing times were faster but only marginally so. Transaction fees were still high, and there were still pressing questions about the future of staking on the blockchain (something Ethereum fixed in April). On top of all that, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin himself acknowledged that a lot of work still had to be done. So, The Merge wasn't some kind of magic rocket fuel that was going to send Ethereum soaring. That lack of immediate sizzle certainly disappointed a lot of investors.\n\nAdd in that many of the blockchain sectors that initially generated a lot of buzz for Ethereum -- such as NFTs and the metaverse -- fell out of favor with users, developers, and investors in 2022. And don't forget, the unprecedented rise of ChatGPT out of seemingly nowhere late last year led to a tremendous swing in investor sentiment. Suddenly, generative artificial intelligence (AI) became the talk of the investment world, and Ethereum admittedly didn't have much to offer in this regard.\n\nInvest in Ethereum for the long haul?\n\nFrom my perspective, Ethereum remains a great long-term investment play. Right now, investor sentiment seems to be at a low point, but that could change soon. Buying Ethereum now, while it's still below $2,000, seems like a fantastic bargain. You're getting a proven market leader at a discount price, combined with a potential catalyst (the new Dencun tech upgrade) to start off the New Year with a bang."
