        "title": "Decoding Decentralized Finance: The Ethereum Revolution - USA TODAY",
        "content": "Jon Stojan\n\nContributor\n\nFor hundreds of years, the heartbeat of our global financial systems has pulsed to a centralized rhythm. Those in control were generally the same: banks, governments, and other institutions, who wielded their authority over financial transactions. A potential shift is currently in motion as we witness a possible transition toward decentralized finance (DeFi), with the Ethereum platform playing a pivotal role in this transformative process.\n\nAs we experience a rapid technological evolution, blockchain technology stands out as a potential game-changer, catapulting us into a new phase of financial autonomy, decentralized finance, or DeFi. This innovative model leverages blockchain technology to deliver financial services such as lending, trading, and borrowing, eliminating the need for traditional middlemen like banks or brokerage firms.\n\nEthereum is at the epicenter of the DeFi revolution. Built upon open-source blockchain technology, the platform makes creating self-executing smart contracts and Distributed Applications (dApps) possible, etching its pivotal role in this rapidly expanding industry. With most DeFi applications built on Ethereum's blockchain, its role in this expanding sector is indispensable.\n\nWhat sets Ethereum apart is its programmability. While Bitcoin's blockchain is primarily used for monetary transactions, Ethereum allows developers to create smart contracts. These self-executing pieces of code automatically carry out transactions once predetermined conditions are fulfilled. This unique feature enabled many DeFi applications, each replicating traditional financial services in a decentralized format.\n\nFor example, take lending and borrowing platforms like Aave and Compound. Carved from Ethereum's blockchain, these platforms illustrate a new peer-to-peer lending model that sidesteps conventional banking structures. Users can engage with these platforms, offering collateral in the form of Ethereum-based assets to borrow or accrue interest on their deposits, with all transactions managed by automated smart contracts.\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs), such as Uniswap and SushiSwap, are another testament to Ethereum's central role in DeFi. In contrast to traditional exchanges that rely on order books to pair buyers and sellers, DEXs employ an algorithmic model known as Automated Market Makers. Operating on the Ethereum network, they give users total control over their assets, enabling trades directly from their wallets.\n\nEthereum is also the cornerstone for emerging decentralized insurance platforms like Nexus Mutual, which offer protection against digital risks like smart contract failures. Members pool resources to cover claims in these mutual models, with payouts and premiums managed by Ethereum-based smart contracts.\n\nAddressing the bottlenecks of Ethereum's scalability issues and high transaction expenses, commonly known as 'gas fees\u2019, are projected improvements to the Ethereum network, encapsulated in Ethereum 2.0. These enhancements aim to streamline the network, promoting scalability, and minimizing fees, paving the way for a more efficient DeFi ecosystem. Moreover, DeFi is poised to attract greater regulatory scrutiny globally as it gains traction.\n\nAs the financial landscape evolves, Ethereum's innovative platform has played an instrumental role in the rise of decentralized finance, fundamentally transforming the financial landscape. By facilitating unfettered access to financial services and reducing the dependency on intermediaries, Ethereum is driving the momentum toward a new epoch of financial freedom. As Ethereum evolves, its influence on the DeFi sector is set to amplify, steering us toward a truly decentralized financial ecosystem.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "The Boom of DeFi: Why Ethereum Is at the Heart of It - Gainesville Sun",
        "content": "Jon Stojan\n\nContributor\n\nDecentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi, is experiencing a boom and setting the stage for a financial revolution. The catalyst? Not Bitcoin, but none other than Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It's time to delve deeper into the wonders of DeFi and the driving force behind its rapid growth.\n\nAt its core, DeFi is a collection of blockchain-based financial applications that are decentralized, open, and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Imagine financial services at your fingertips, devoid of banks or other financial intermediaries. Imagine banking the unbanked and transforming the traditional financial landscape. That\u2019s what DeFi promises, and that's why it matters.\n\nNow, let's understand the technology powering these financial applications. These are built on blockchain networks, with Ethereum at the forefront, and rely heavily on smart contracts. These self-executing contracts, with the terms of agreement directly written into code lines, facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a transaction. This mechanism is what allows DeFi protocols to offer a myriad of financial services, including lending and borrowing, trading, asset management, and insurance, seamlessly and efficiently.\n\nEthereum\u2019s prominence in DeFi is far from accidental. In fact, it\u2019s the linchpin holding the DeFi sector together. Thanks to Ethereum's smart contract functionality, developers can create intricate financial protocols that execute transactions automatically, eliminating intermediaries and fostering transparency. Uniswap, an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange (DEX), lets users trade Ethereum tokens directly from their wallets without the need for an order book or a central exchange. This automated market maker (AMM) system is a game-changer, redefining cryptocurrency trading practices.\n\nConsider Compound, another flagship Ethereum DeFi protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. Using an algorithmic interest rate system, it strikes a balance between supply and demand to provide the best possible returns. In this bustling ecosystem, stablecoins also find their place.\n\nUsers reaping the benefits of the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem enjoy a new level of financial freedom. But like any burgeoning technology, it has its share of challenges. Scalability issues, security vulnerabilities, and regulatory uncertainties are among the major hurdles that Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem has to overcome. True, other blockchains are striving to achieve the same goal. Yet, their progress in DeFi lags behind Ethereum.\n\nIt isn't just about being the second-largest cryptocurrency or having a dedicated team and a roadmap for improvements. Ethereum's enduring allure lies in its capability to reach a wider audience and its potential to drive innovation and experimentation in the financial space.\n\nEthereum 2.0, a highly anticipated upgrade, offers a glimmer of hope. It plans to introduce proof-of-stake consensus and sharding, aiming for better scalability and speed. Layer 2 solutions are also on the horizon, promising to boost the network's capacity. Despite the obstacles, the evolution of Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem is a testament to its resilience and adaptability.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum's position as the powerhouse of the DeFi world is unchallenged. The advent of innovation and upgrades could potentially make it the backbone of a new, globally accepted system for transferring value.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Top 6 Ethereum Facts : All You Need To Know - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum stands as a decentralized blockchain platform driven by the Ether token, offering users a versatile range of capabilities. From facilitating transactions to playing games, engaging in cryptocurrency trading, storing nonfungible tokens (NFTs) earning interest through staking, and even participating in social media activities, the platform presents a comprehensive ecosystem.\n\nMany envision Ethereum as the natural progression of the internet. While centralized platforms like Apple\u2019s App Store embody the era of Web 2.0, Ethereum represents the dawn of Web 3.0\u2014a decentralized, community-driven network. This new phase in internet evolution supports decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It\u2019s crucial to note that Ether, not Ethereum, is the designated crypto unit.\n\nNow, let\u2019s unravel some lesser-known facts that add intriguing dimensions to the Ethereum narrative.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Supply Dynamics\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum takes a different stance on token supply. With over 120 million its tokens circulating, a stark contrast emerges\u2014over ten times more tokens than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin\u2019s value is influenced by its approaching finite supply of 21 million coins, Ethereum follows a different trajectory, emphasizing abundance over scarcity.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s imminent scarcity pushes its value higher and poses challclassicenges to mining. The philosophy is straightforward: fewer coins available often translate to higher cryptocurrency value. Once a cryptocurrency reaches its maximum supply, mining stops, and market dynamics revolve around supply and demand.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum doesn\u2019t impose a fixed supply cap. Instead, it employs a mechanism called \u201cminimum viable issuance\u201d to manage Ether\u2019s inflation rate, ensuring network security and motivating validators.\n\nThe platform\u2019s issuance rate undergoes adjustments through Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and community consensus. Diverging from Bitcoin\u2019s fixed cap, it introduces a flexible approach, allowing for ongoing adjustments to maintain balance within the network. Notably, EIP-1559 introduces a deflationary element by burning a portion of ETH as a base fee, contributing to the evolving economic dynamics of the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dual Narrative\n\nThe Ethereum community faced a seismic event in 2015\u2014the DAO hack, resulting in a substantial loss of $150 million worth of tokens. To salvage Ethereum from the brink of collapse, a consequential decision was made: a hard fork. However, a faction within the community, guided by the principle of \u201cCode is law,\u201d opted to adhere to the original code. This pivotal moment birthed two chains\u2014the forked chain retaining the name Ethereum, and the original chain christened Ethereum Classic, which continues to follow the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, preserving the ethos of the original code.\n\nThe Genesis: Birth and Philosophy\n\nEthereum\u2019s beginnings trace back to 2013, involving a collective effort by eight individuals, including the visionary Vitalik Buterin, who crafted the coin (ETH) in Switzerland. With its official launch in 2015, Ethereum\u2019s origin story bears the imprint of Buterin\u2019s dissatisfaction with centralized services\u2014a sentiment molded by his experiences in the world of World of Warcraft. This critical perspective formed the philosophical foundation of Ethereum, steering its path toward decentralization.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to avoid confusion between Ethereum and Ether. Ether, the native token, serves as a virtual coin within the Ethereum network, much like other digital currencies. Beyond being a tradable asset, Ether plays various roles\u2014it is used for transactions, runs applications within the Ethereum network, and serves as a means to monetize activities conducted on the platform.\n\nEthereum\u2019s move towards Proof-of-Stake\n\nIn the early days, both Bitcoin and Ethereum relied on a process called \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d (PoW), where individuals could mine new tokens by validating blockchain transactions on their personal computers. However, in September 2022, Ethereum (ETH) underwent a significant transformation, moving away from PoW to embrace Proof-of-Stake.\n\nUnder PoS, new coins are created when crypto owners \u201cstake\u201d their own coins, essentially locking them up to participate in transaction verification and, consequently, earn rewards. While this method was already employed by Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), Ether swiftly ascended to become the leading cryptocurrency in terms of staked value.\n\nThe primary motivation behind this shift lies in energy efficiency. The energy consumption associated with Ethereum transactions was staggering, equating to over 100,000 VISA transactions in December 2021. However, post the Ethereum Merge, the energy footprint notably decreased. Observers believe that this change not only influences public perceptions of cryptocurrencies but also holds implications for the future development of popular decentralized finance (DeFi) categories within Ethereum, such as crypto lending.\n\nExploring Alternatives to \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d\n\nEthereum encountered a pivotal moment known as the \u201cSplit,\u201d sparking a quest for alternatives to the traditional \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d (PoW) model. As some enthusiasts applaud the reduction in energy costs, not all its formerminers welcomed the Merge, a transition away from the PoW model.\n\nIn September 2022, a revealing graphic displayed a substantial dump of Ethereum (ETH) by miners holding blockchain addresses linked to their mining activities. Expecting a price surge post-Merge, these miners were disappointed, leading to the selling of their ETH holdings.\n\nThe blockchain witnessed a surge in transaction counts, reaching approximately 1.1 million per day in September 2022. This uptick in activity coincided with the aftermath of the Merge and the subsequent dissatisfaction among miners. The dissatisfaction prompted a significant number of miners to part ways, seeking alternative cryptocurrencies for their mining endeavors.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Crowdfunding\n\nEthereum\u2019s inception traces back to a community-driven initiative, spearheaded by its creator, Vitalik Buterin. In 2013, Buterin conceived the idea of decentralized blockchain platform, inspired by a sense of dissatisfaction with the limitations he observed in Bitcoin. His vision extended beyond the constraints of existing blockchain technology, aiming to create a platform capable of supporting intricate and diverse applications.\n\nIn 2014, he initiated a community-backed fundraising effort, selling the initial batch of Ethereum tokens known as Ether (ETH) to the public. This crowdfunding campaign marked a significant milestone, surpassing expectations and raising over $18 million in just 42 days. Notably, this successful endeavour propelled the blockchain into the ranks of the first and largest crowdfunded projects in history.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey began not only as a technological innovation but as a testament to the power of community support, illustrating how collaborative efforts can pave the way for ground breaking projects in the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology.\n\nBonus: Ethereum\u2019s Growing Influence in Tech Boardrooms\n\nBeyond the realm of developers and investors, Ethereum has captured the attention of major corporations. Giants like Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, Intel, and Amazon are exploring itspotential solutions. Enterprise software companies, including IBM and Deloitte, are testing the platform\u2019s networks, signaling a broader acceptance of blockchain technology in corporate landscapes.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the dynamic landscape of blockchain, Ethereum stands as a pioneer, symbolizing innovation, adaptability, and community-driven progress. Beyond its decentralized framework, the popular platform embodies the essence of Web 3.0, ushering in a new era of user empowerment. From token dynamics to the Proof-of-Stake transition and corporate intrigue, Ethereum\u2019s journey reflects a dynamic intersection of technological evolution and philosophical principles. As it charts the course for decentralized possibilities, it serves as a testament to collective spirit in advancing blockchain technology."

        "content": "History was made on Saturday when the first ever loan against a domain name was executed with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The significance is that the success marks the birth of a new asset class that can be leveraged to unlock capital for business owners or domain name investors in an expeditious and secure manner.\n\ndeBanked founder Sean Murray was the executor of the transaction. The process involved tokenizing a domain name (domainfi.net) into an NFT and then offering that NFT as collateral on an NFT loan marketplace. When a loan was executed on the platform with a smart contract, the domain name was automatically placed into an ethereum address to be held as escrow. If the borrower were to default on the loan, the smart contract would automatically release the domain name to the lender, who would now have full control of it.\n\nThe process involved two parties, the tokenizing registrar and the NFT loan marketplace. The loan, which was consummated for proof of concept, carried a 10% APY and a 7-day term. It took less than 20 minutes combined to complete the tokenization and loan execution process.\n\n\u201cI was guessing that this capability might still be another year away and I had not even dreamed that I would be the very first one to execute this type of loan,\u201d said Murray. \u201cFollowing this space closely probably contributed to that stroke of luck. There is still time until this is ready to be a consumer-facing product in the marketplace, but the tech already exists and transactions of this nature are already viable. It will be fascinating to watch.\u201d\n\nAbout deBanked\n\ndeBanked was launched in 2010.

        "content": "Ethereum options trading volume has rallied to an all-time high in January.\n\nThe coin has seen a decline in open interest in its futures market.\n\nWith $17.9 billion recorded so far this month, Ethereum [ETH] options trading volume has skyrocketed to an all-time high, according to The Block Data dashboard.\n\nThis represents a 2% uptick from the $17.7 billion recorded in trading volume in the coin\u2019s options market in December.\n\nAn assessment of the coin\u2019s put-call ratio showed that a significant amount of the 932,000 Ether options contracts that expired on the 26th of January were bets in favor of a price rally.\n\nIn a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), GreeksLive noted that Ethereum options open interest had a put-call ratio of 0.31 prior to the expiry of the options contracts.\n\nAn asset\u2019s put-call ratio measures market sentiment regarding that asset. It does this by dividing the number of outstanding put options (bets on the price falling) by the number of outstanding call options (bets on the price rising).\n\nWith a put-call ratio of 0.31, it means that for every 100 ETH call options purchased, only 31 put options were bought. This showed that participants in ETH\u2019s derivatives market expected its price to rise or at least hold steady near expiration.\n\nJan. 26 Options Data\n\n94,000 BTC options are about to expire with a Put Call Ratio of 0.51, a Maxpain point of $41,000 and a notional value of $3.75 billion.\n\n932,000 ETH options are about to expire with a Put Call Ratio of 0.31, Maxpain point of $2,300 and notional value of $2.07\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EifV6kgUBz \u2014 Greeks.live (@GreeksLive) January 26, 2024\n\nETH\u2019s futures market\n\nIn the coin\u2019s futures market, the approach adopted by traders differs. AMBCrypto found that ETH\u2019s futures open interest has declined 11% since the 17th of January. It fell from $8.7 billion to $7 billion at press time, according to data from Coinglass.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s open interest drops in this manner, it suggests that fewer new futures contracts are being opened due to declining price volatility, waning positive sentiment, or traders simply closing existing positions without opening new ones.\n\nAn assessment of some volatility markers confirmed the decline in price swings since the middle of the month.\n\nFor example, ETH\u2019s Average True Range (ATR) \u2013 which measures market volatility by calculating the average range between high and low prices over a specified number of periods \u2013 was spotted at 100.50 at press time. It has dropped by 15% since the 13th of January.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nWhen ATR witnesses a decline, it suggests that the price swings are becoming less significant. In a similar trend, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Volatility has declined by 160% within the same period.\n\nThis indicator also measures price volatility by tracking the difference between an asset\u2019s high and low prices over a specified period. When it declines, volatility is low."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is about witnessing a potential sell-off worth $1 billion. This significant transaction is rooted in actions by Celsius, a bankrupt crypto lender. Reports from on-chain analyst Lookonchain indicate that Celsius initiated the transfer of 459,561 ETH, estimated to be worth around $1.014 billion, to various exchanges.\n\nThe breakdown of this large-scale distribution includes 297,454 ETH ($656.5 million) moved to Coinbase Prime, 146,507 ETH to Paxos Treasury, and smaller sums totaling 7,800 ETH ($17.2 million) sent to FalconX and Coinbase, respectively. Despite this transfer, Lookonchain disclosed that Celsius still maintains a reserve of 62,468 ETH, valued at roughly $139 million.\n\nThis significant transfer carries significant weight in the Ethereum market. It poses a challenge as it exerts considerable pressure on Ethereum\u2019s price, with potential implications for broader market sentiment. Ethereum could see a significant plunge if the $1.014 billion worth of ETH is sold simultaneously.\n\nCelsius\u2019 Previous Ethereum Transactions\n\nCelsius\u2019 latest Ethereum transactions aren\u2019t isolated events. LookonChain has previously spotted significant transfers linked to Celsius, including a deposit of 13,000 ETH ($30 million) on Coinbase and 2,200 ETH ($5 million) to FalconX.\n\nWhile these moves indicate Celsius\u2019 proactive strategy in managing its financial challenges, they also signal potential volatility for Ethereum\u2019s market value.\n\nFurthermore, Arkham Intelligence reports that between January 8 and January 12, Celsius liquidated over $125 million worth of Ethereum. The primary objective of these sales is to fulfill obligations to creditors.\n\nDune Analytics also highlighted the pattern of large-scale Ethereum redemptions, noting redemptions exceeding $1.6 billion. Since last year\u2019s Shanghai update, this figure represents the highest Ethereum redemptions recorded.\n\nAs part of its bankruptcy proceedings, Celsius continues liquidating Ethereum holdings to pay off debts.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Market Reaction\n\nIn the aftermath of Celsius\u2019s Ethereum transactions, the asset has seen a nearly 10% decline in value over the past week, dropping from a high above $2,600 to around $2,186 yesterday. However, Ethereum has slightly recovered, rising by 2.2% in the past 24 hours, with a trading price of $2,258 at the time of writing.\n\nAmid these market developments, Michael van de Poppe, a renowned crypto analyst, has identified three key factors that could signal a bullish phase for ETH. A significant element is Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior, often setting the tone for altcoins.\n\nVan de Poppe notes that Bitcoin\u2019s indications of bottoming out usually precede rallies in altcoins, suggesting a potential upturn for Ethereum. He also emphasizes the increasing excitement around spot Ethereum ETFs, which could catalyze Ethereum\u2019s market value in the coming weeks.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s impending network upgrades, which aim to reduce transaction costs significantly, are expected to enhance the network\u2019s efficiency and scalability, potentially boosting its market appeal.\n\nThe momentum towards $ETH is probably going to come in the next few weeks.

        "content": "Bitcoin Sentiment Sours: What\u2019s Behind the Pessimism?\n\nSince the SEC approved Bitcoin on January 10, the price of the cryptocurrency has dropped 15%. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs was heralded as a very bullish development. The major withdrawals from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which converted from a closed-ended trust to an exchange-traded fund (ETF), are blamed for this decline.\n\nNot all of the more than $3 billion that has been redeemed from GBTC has gone into other Bitcoin ETFs. VC Chris Burniske, with a pessimistic outlook, believes that Bitcoin may drop to $20,000.\n\nWhy is everyone suddenly bearish about bitcoin? Opinion by @danielgkuhn for The Node newsletterhttps://t.co/PZVWMlupAC \u2014 CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) January 26, 2024\n\nLong-term obstacles to Bitcoin appear to be minimal despite worries, as regulatory clarity is projected to improve and GBTC outflows are anticipated to come to an end.\n\nThe introduction of the ETF, which has drawn record-breaking volumes and retail investors, represents the long-term viability of the asset class.\n\nCFTC Chair Advocates for Stricter Bitcoin ETF Regulations\n\nFollowing the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has underlined the urgent need for federal legislation to govern the cash market for digital assets. Behnam emphasized the absence of regulatory control for the cash market of digital assets while voicing concerns about possible misinterpretations by institutional and ordinary investors.\n\nA \u201cthin layer of indirect regulation,\u201d he claimed, surrounds Bitcoin ETFs, bringing up concerns about trade resolution, conflicts of interest, data reporting, cybersecurity, consumer protection, transparency, and market integrity.\n\nIf you're considering an investment involving crypto assets, be cautious.

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) had depressing week after the historic approval and trading of several crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market cap plunged hard on Monday following a sell-off from digital asset fund manager Grayscale. The virtual coin dropped below $40,000 (to $38,678) on Tuesday, but slowly recovered as the week went on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is now trading for $41,830, CoinGecko data shows, a less than 1% movement over seven days.\n\nBefore Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF started trading, it had operated like a closed-end fund where investors could not redeem their shares for BTC. However, following its conversion and subsequent trading, investors started to cash out quickly.\n\nThis led Grayscale to send huge amounts of the cryptocurrency to its custodian, Coinbase, leading to pressure on BTC\u2019s price.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s sell-off slowed towards the end of the week\u2014likely leading to the rebound in BTC\u2019s price.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news, though: Analysts told Decrypt that Bitcoin \u201ccould see increased appeal\u201d in 2024\u2014if the Federal Reserve slashes interest rates.\n\nBut BTC\u2019s plunge in the week hit the wider crypto market. Ethereum (ETH) was a big loser, dropping to $2,186 on Tuesday and never really recovering, logging an 8% loss over the week. It\u2019s now trading for $2,264.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIts drop came following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s decision to delay ETH ETF proposals from both BlackRock and Grayscale.\n\nElsewhere, Solana (SOL) took a beating. It was, at the start of the week, one of the worst-performing cryptocurrencies. It has since picked up and is trading for $92.60, a more than 1% seven-day rise.\n\nWhile Dogecoin (DOGE)\u2014the original meme coin and 11th biggest cryptocurrency\u2014pumped at the start of the week over speculation that it might be used for payments on Twitter, it slowly drifted back to where it started. It kicked off the week at $0.08, and is back at the same spot as of writing.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Along with Bitcoin, institutional investors are willing to gain exposure to some of the top altcoins. As a result, some of the top players like BlackRock are actively pursuing approval for a spot Ethereum ETF from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Holds 60% Approval Chance\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart suggested that there is an estimated 60% likelihood of spot Ethereum ETFs receiving approval in May. However, the recent postponement of decisions on potential ether ETFs from BlackRock and Grayscale by the Securities and Exchange Commission has impacted the outcomes. Other contenders for a spot ether ETF, including Ark 21Shares and VanEck, are also awaiting regulatory decisions.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMay 23 is the upcoming crucial date in the spot ether narrative, according to Seyffart. On this date, the 240-day window for the SEC to make decisions on proposals from Ark/21Shares and VanEck will conclude. Speaking to Blockworks, Seyffart added:\n\n\u201cMy base case is still probably around 60-ish percent that they\u2019ll approve them. But there\u2019s plenty of ways they can delay. So if the SEC wants to get geared up and ready to go and wants everyone to go at the same time, they\u2019ll likely do it on May 23 unless they can figure out some way to deny or delay this whole process and do what they want\u201d.\n\nNevertheless, when the May deadlines approach, the SEC has the option to request potential issuers to withdraw their applications or issue denials. According to Seyffart, if the SEC asks Ark/21Shares or VanEck to withdraw, it could be seen as a positive sign indicating potential approval. He added, \u201cThe SEC might just need more time to get up to speed with Ethereum versus Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHowever, if the May approval for spot Ethereum ETF doesn\u2019t work out, Seyffart believes that it shall happen next year in 2025.\n\nETF Approval Almost Guaranteed In Long Term\n\nVan Buren Capital general partner Scott Johnsson shared his perspective on the potential roadmap for an ETH ETF in a recent post on X Thursday. While acknowledging the current nuances, he anticipates that, in the long term, the approval of an ETH spot ETF is highly likely.\n\nThe Road Ahead: A View on ETH Spot This is intended to be a deep dive into the current landscape for crypto spot ETFs generally with emphasis on ETH. Will do this in 4 parts for ease of reference. 1 \u2013 General Roadmap\n\n2 \u2013 Threshold Issue\n\n3 \u2013 BTC Spot Approval\n\n4 \u2013 ETH Analysis\n\n\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) January 25, 2024\n\nJohnsson sees the presence of ether futures ETFs as a positive factor for potential approval, considering the SEC\u2019s previous approval of Bitcoin ETFs based on similar grounds. However, Seyffart suggested that the SEC might scrutinize spot ether ETFs, claiming the futures market lacks sufficient size, liquidity, or impact.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in a recent interview, expressed the view that the SEC shouldn\u2019t require a court decision to recognize the arbitrary nature of its approach. She emphasized applying precedent to spot Ethereum ETF decisions."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\n\ufeffAnalyst Crypto Jebb has opened up about the reason behind the major drop in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the last 24 hours, attributing it to the filling of the Bitcoin CME Futures Gap. While some may believe that this marks the end of the drop, Jebb argues otherwise, hinting the potential for further decline.\n\nBitcoin experienced an impressive 120-day rally, soaring from $25,000 to $49,000, primarily fueled by the excitement surrounding the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, since their introduction about two weeks ago, Bitcoin has entered a downtrend.\n\nJebb points out that the initial support level was quickly breached, leading to a sharp decline back to $44,000 immediately after trading commenced. Predictions were made for a potential drop to $32,500. The size of the previous rally is a crucial factor in Jebb\u2019s analysis, suggesting that larger rallies often precede more substantial drops. With Bitcoin\u2019s $24,000 rally, a 50% correction could result in a $12,000 drop, bringing Bitcoin to approximately $37,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $39,700 levels.\n\nJebb points to various indicators supporting his bearish outlook, such as the Fear and Greed Index, which has not fully reset and remains above 50. Additionally, both the three-day and weekly chart indicators like MACD and RSI are signaling strong bearish sentiment.\n\nAlso Read: Breaking Down the Ethereum ETF Approval Roadmap with Finance Expert Scott Johnsson\n\nThe recent shift of Bitcoin from the GBTC trust to exchanges, influenced by the introduction of ETFs and associated fees, has added significant sell pressure. Jebb notes that many bulls, especially those holding the GBTC trust, are now taking profits.\n\nThe analysis extends beyond Bitcoin, anticipating potential drops in various altcoins. Jebb suggests that Ethereum could dip to $1,800, Solana to $48, and Cardano to around $0.40 in the coming bearish trend. Despite the current bearish outlook, Jebb remains optimistic about a future market rally in 2024 and 2025."

Upgradeability mechanisms allow it to evolve and adopt new features to remain relevant and address emerging challenges in the blockchain space.\n\nGlobal Impact and Pioneering Spirit: Ethereum has gone beyond being a mere technological advancement; it has ignited a global conversation about decentralization, ownership, and financial autonomy. Its pioneering spirit continues to inspire innovation and shape the future of our digital world.\n\nHow To Get Started on the Ethereum Network for ERC-20 Tokens.\n\nTo buy/sell ERC-20 Tokens, you\u2019ll need a crypto wallet. There are several crypto wallets to choose from within the Ethereum network and, popular options include software wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Binance WAllet, etc.\n\nIf you are using a desktop computer, you can download Google Chrome and install the MetaMask Wallet Chrome extension. If you prefer using your mobile phone, you can download MetaMask wallet via Google Play or the iOS App Store.\n\nJust make sure that you are downloading the official Chrome extension and mobile app by visiting MetaMask Wallet\u2019s website.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve registered and set up your wallet via the Google Chrome Extension or via the mobile app you downloaded, MetaMask wallet allows users to manage their cryptocurrency wallets and interact with decentralized applications (DApps) to execute transactions on supported blockchain networks directly from their browsers. (Write down your seed phrase on a piece of paper and keep it in a safe place!).\n\nNow, you\u2019ll need to connect and add Ethereum to your MetaMask wallet. You may refer to MetaMask support page for reference on their website.\n\nTrading ERC-20 Tokens on the Ethereum Network.\n\nIn order to ERC-20 token trades on the Ethereum network, you will need to buy ETH as your base currency. You can buy ETH on centralized exchanges such as Binance, copy your wallet address from Metamask, and then send the ETH from Binance to your Metamask wallet.\n\nYou can also purchase ETH directly within the Metamask wallet using traditional payment methods such as credit or debit cards, etc.\n\nJust click on the \u201cBuy/Sell\u201d button within Metamask to open the interface. Here, you can put how much ETH (or any other token) you want to buy in terms of dollar terms, pick your payment method, and then click \u201cBuy\u201d.\n\nNote that to buy crypto directly within Metamask, you will need to provide info such as your country and state. However, it is a straightforward process that only takes a minute.\n\nIt\u2019ll only take a couple of minutes at most for your ETH to arrive in your wallet. Once the ETH arrives, you are all set to begin trading ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network. So, head over to UniSwap to get started on your trading journey.\n\nHow To Trade ERC-20 Tokens On The Ethereum Network Using UniSwap\n\nUniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to trade Ethereum-based tokens directly from their wallets without the need for intermediaries or traditional order books.\n\nUniswap offers users a simple and straightforward way to buy and sell a wide variety of tokens. Be sure you\u2019re on the Uniswap website to protect your wallet.\n\nThe first step is clicking on the \u201cLaunch App\u201d button at the top right corner, as shown in the image below:\n\nThe next step is clicking on the connect wallet option on Uniswap at the top right corner, as shown in the image below:\n\nConnect to your preferred wallet as shown below. (In this case, it\u2019s Metamask):\n\nOnce connected, switch Metamask to the Ethereum network. (If you\u2019re already on the Ethereum network, you do not need to switch):\n\nAfter connecting MetaMask to the Ethereum network, go to Uniswap, and then you can start your ERC-20 Tokens on the Ethereum network using UniSwap.\n\nTrading Ethereum Tokens On Uniswap\n\nThe next step is to select your preferred tokens on the UnsSwap interface and since Uniswap operates on a token to token trading model, click on the \u201cselect token\u201d button to select the trading pair you want to trade against.\n\nFor example, if you want to buy USDT using ETH, select ETH \u2013 USDT, enter the amount, then click on \u201cswap\u201d or \u201ctrade now\u201d and confirm the transaction in your Metamask wallet. You can view the tokens in your wallet\u2019s asset list.\n\nBuying and Selling ERC-20 Tokens with the Metamask Wallet\n\nEthereum Network users can also buy and sell tokens using the Metamask extension wallet already connected to the Ethereum network. To do this, make sure you\u2019re connected to the Ethereum network and have ETH to swap and pay for gas fees. Then, navigate to the \u201cSwap\u201d button as shown below. This will take you to the Swap interface inside Metamask.\n\nUsing the image above as a guide, you can also search for tokens using the name or the contract address, just like on UniSwap. Input the amount of ETH you want to swap, confirm that you have the correct token, and then click \u201cSwap.\u201d Once the transaction is confirmed, the tokens you just bought will be sent to your wallet.\n\nTracking ERC-20 Token Prices on The Ethereum Network\n\nERC-20 token holders and traders can take advantage of on-chain tools like DeFiLama to gain access to comprehensive market insights for specific tokens. These insights include price data and contract information, empowering users to make well-informed trading decisions based on reliable and up-to-date information.\n\nDextools is a comprehensive analytic resource for managing digital assets traded on ERC-20 Decentralized Exchanges. It\u2019s a vibrant analytical cryptocurrency resource that provides statistical information on all leading blockchains and crypto projects.\n\nAmong these features, an exceptional one is the charting functionality, which delivers both real-time and historical price data for a wide range of tokens.\n\nBy utilizing these charts, users gain valuable insights into price trends, trading volumes, and other pertinent metrics. This enables them to pinpoint potential entry or exit points for their trades with precision and confidence. For example, let\u2019s assume you\u2019re $ETH for $LIDO, your trading pair is ETH/LIDO.\n\nNote, Trading pairs serve as bridges between currencies. For example, the ETH/LIDOpair allows you to acquire $LIDO tokens using Ethereum (ETH).\n\nChoose the pair that fits your funding situation and trading strategy. Consider using ETH if you already hold it, or fiat currencies if you\u2019re venturing in fresh.\n\nLet\u2019s track the $LIDO token on Dextools, here\u2019s what we have:\n\nConclusion\n\nBuying, selling, and trading ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network can be a thrilling adventure, opening doors to exciting investment opportunities and unlocking the potential of decentralized finance. However, it demands knowledge, caution, and a well-defined strategy.\n\nThis guide serves as your map and compass, but the ultimate treasure lies in your own learning and exploration. Navigate with confidence, trade responsibly, and remember that the most valuable asset in this journey is your knowledge.\n\nFeatured image from CoinMarketCap, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP appears to have begun its market movements earlier than anticipated. The chart shows a notable shift from the recent sideways trading pattern, as XRP starts to carve out a new direction.\n\nAs of the latest trends, XRP has been testing the support level around $0.50, a crucial psychological threshold for the asset. A sustained move below this level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially leading the price to test the next significant support zone around $0.47.\n\nOn the flip side, if XRP manages to stabilize and bounce back from the current support, the initial resistance is likely to be encountered near the $0.54 mark, where the 50-day moving average currently lies. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.\n\nFurther complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.\n\nSolana is leading pack\n\nSolana is manifesting its strength as the top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite overall market volatility, SOL's price action has been signaling a stronger recovery compared to other assets.\n\nAt the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.\n\nResistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.\n\nThe relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.\n\nEthereum needs push\n\nThe Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.\n\nAt present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.\n\nResistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.\n\nThe selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.\n\nOn the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary \"fuel,\" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average."

        "content": "Optimism implements a hardfork in preparation for Dencun.\n\nEIP-4844 will bring reduced transaction fees on the network.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] Dencun upgrade is approaching, and Layer 2 solutions such as Optimism [OP] have expressed readiness for this upcoming development. The upgrade is set to impact the fees on Optimism, but what other changes can be expected?\n\nOptimism set for Dencun activation\n\nOptimism recently shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), announcing the arrival of 4844. Although the post may seem cryptic initially, further examination revealed that it alluded to the network\u2019s adoption of the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP).\n\nThis upgrade is part of the preparations for the upcoming Ethereum Dencun upgrade.\n\nOptimism has successfully implemented the Ecotone hardfork on its Goerli development networks. It has enabled the submission of batches through EIP-4844 blobs.\n\nThis suggests that once Dencun is activated on the Ethereum mainnet, OP Stack chains will be able to leverage blob space, leading to reductions in transaction fees.\n\nThe state of Optimism L2 and POS network\n\nExamining Total Value Locked (TVL) data on L2 Beats showed that Optimism maintained dominance over other Layer 2 solutions. As of this writing, it held over 25% of the space, amounting to over $5.2 billion.\n\nIn addition, a review of OP mainnet statistics showed that the completed transactions were over 195 million. However, the number of new transactions has experienced a decline after reaching its peak in two months.\n\nThe chart showed a rise in transactions to over 500,000 on 24th January, followed by a slight decrease to around 460,000 at the time of this writing.\n\nFurthermore, an analysis of new accounts also showed a recent downturn. On 24th January, the number of new accounts, similar to transactions, rose to over 13,000.\n\nAs of this writing, this figure has decreased to around 9,000. The anticipated reduction that the Dencun activation might bring could attract more users to the network. This could increase the number of users and transactions.\n\nOP close to breaking immediate resistance\n\nA daily timeframe analysis of Optimism showed a sustained recovery, with the chart showing its third consecutive day of upward movement.\n\nAt the time of this writing, it was trading at around $3, showing a more than 4% increase in value.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 OPs worth today\n\nFurthermore, the continuous rise has positioned it close to breaking the immediate resistance. This resistance level is around $3.1, with its short-moving average (yellow line) marking this level.\n\nOP could be further impacted positively by reduced fees and increased transactions."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) performance against Bitcoin (BTC) is a leading indicator of market cycles and an altseason. Thus, cryptocurrency traders and investors constantly monitor the ETH/BTC pair for valuable insights.\n\nIn particular, the well-known CrediBULL Crypto has his eyes turned to this pair and warns of a possible Ethereum sell-off. According to him, Ethereum has found a local top against Bitcoin in an expected deviation above previous highs.\n\nCrediBULL Crypto posted this analysis on X (formerly Twitter) on January 25, quoting a previous post where he forecasted the deviation, as happened.\n\nBoom. Beautiful rejection on ETH/BTC as expected. May revisit those local highs but imo a full retrace of ETH/BTC is on the horizon as $BTC recovers from this recent correction and begins it's next impulsive move to the upside, outperforming ETH once again.\n\n\n\nAs I have said before\u2026 https://t.co/HllnRI4Pee pic.twitter.com/uiOqcVvRBO \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) January 25, 2024\n\nETH/BTC analysis\n\nNotably, the trader points to a breakout from the current support line at 0.04905 BTC per Ethereum. Furthermore, ETH/BTC should continue its downfall through 0.04624 BTC straight to a range below 0.03800 BTC.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: CrediBULL Crypto\n\nCrediBULL Crypto explained ETH/BTC will only find a bottom once Bitcoin makes a new all-time high. Therefore, investors must be aware of \u201cany bounces before that,\u201d as they will most likely fade away, in his words.\n\nSince posting, Bitcoin has already outperformed Ethereum by around 2%, validating the above analysis. However, the economic context is a key factor to consider. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable, and everything could change swiftly.\n\nOn the other hand, institutional investors are turning to Ethereum and showing support for altcoins and tokenization. Recently, Franklin Templeton backed ETH, SOL, and other cryptocurrencies focused on utility. In the meantime, BlackRock\u2019s CEO shared his vision of tokenization while talking about an expected Ethereum spot ETF approval.\n\nAll things considered, it is possible that the ETH/BTC pair surprise technical analysts in the near future, depending on further developments involving institutions and the regulatory landscape. Investors must trade cautiously, keeping themselves updated on the adoption and demand for Ethereum or Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Polygon pulled a decent number of users in 2023.\n\nThe number of active users has increased recently.\n\nRecent reports showed that Polygon [MATIC] had a strong performance in 2023, particularly in certain key metrics. The data revealed strong competition with Ethereum, and it ranked higher than all other major blockchain networks.\n\nPolygon comes second in the number of acquired users\n\nPolygon delivered an impressive performance that went somewhat unnoticed by many.\n\nHowever, recent data published by Flipside sheds light on the network\u2019s standing, showing that it ranked second only to Ethereum in user metrics. The data showed that the observed networks attracted over 62 million users.\n\nAmong these, Polygon had over 15.2 million acquired users, placing it just behind Ethereum with its over 15.4 million acquired users. In this context, \u201cacquired users\u201d refers to users who conducted at least two transactions on the network.\n\nDigging deeper into the data, Polygon also secured the second position in the number of super users. In this context, super users are those acquired users who conducted over 100 transactions on a specific network.\n\nThe data showed that Polygon had more than 510,000 such users in 2023. Furthermore, the network claimed the second-highest count of super users among NFT buyers and sellers for the year, with over 175,000 buyers and over 120,000 sellers, respectively.\n\nHow transactions trended on Polygon\n\nAn immediate observation in the analysis of Polygon\u2019s transaction trend is the remarkable volume it experienced in 2023.\n\nThe Scanner chart clearly showed that the network reached its peak transaction volume that year. Specifically, the highest daily transaction count recorded was over 16.4 million on 16th November, 2023.\n\nHowever, recent data showed a notable decline, with the current transaction count at over 3.3 million as of this writing.\n\nThe active account chart over the past year showed no significant trends besides a spike around October. However, recent developments showed a shift as the number of active accounts increased.\n\nAt the time of this analysis, the count of active accounts was around 673,000. The network\u2019s highest-ever recorded number of active accounts was 782,186.\n\nMATIC sees more downtrends than uptrends\n\nPolygon showed strong performance towards the end of the previous year. Still, the new year has yet to see a continuation of this impressive trend.\n\nThe daily timeframe chart showed a downward trend for most of the year. However, as of the current assessment, it was trading with an over 2.4% increase in value, reaching around $0.74.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 MATICs worth today\n\nAnalyzing the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showed that Polygon requires additional uptrends to break free from the prevailing bearish trend it currently faces.\n\nThe positive increase in value at present suggests a potential shift, but sustained upward movement will be crucial for a more significant reversal in its overall trend."

AMBCrypto found that despite fluctuations in prices or the higher timeframe trends in the price action, this metric has climbed from 19 million ETH to 29.3 million ETH at press time.\n\nThis was a significant, yet steady uptick.\n\nThe circulating supply of Ethereum stood at 120.18 million ETH at press time, based on data from CoinMarketCap. This was a sign that investors trusted ETH and the network enormously, even though it is not evident on the price chart just yet.\n\nEthereum is still underperforming Bitcoin\n\nWhile the total staked ETH measured 24% of the circulating supply, its uptrend has slowed since December. It rose by only 600k ETH in the past two months, compared to the 1.6 million ETH it gained in the two months before then.\n\nAt the same time, the Ethereum on exchanges has declined. This downtrend has been in play since 2020. Combined with the increase in staked ETH, the inference was a strong confidence in ETH 2.0 in the market.\n\nEthereum also has a deflationary nature. The past year saw a -0.28% change in the Ethereum supply, according to data from YCharts. A recent report from AMBCrypto noted that the Bitcoin spot ETF approval news dented the active validators count.\n\nGlassnode data showed that the metric trended downward since the 3rd of January.

Before this dip, the metric had been in an uptrend since 2021 when Glassnode began gathering data for this metric.\n\nThe active addresses count appeared to plateau\n\nThe combination of falling exchange reserves, rising validators, and rising ETH staked pointed toward robust network security. The active addresses metric has also been in an uptrend since November 2023.\n\nHowever, the 7-day SMA saw a significant dip in the second half of January. This followed the sharp drop in prices ETH suffered, falling from $2.7k to $2.2k.

During the first half of 2023, Polygon led the user acquisition race but was later surpassed by Ethereum, maintaining its lead throughout the latter part of the year.\n\nIs the bull is really here?

Ethereum secured the lead for the entire year, while Bitcoin claimed the third position with 10.65 million acquired users. Solana and Arbitrum completed the top five rankings.\n\nThe aggregated data from the eight tracked blockchains, including Optimism (OP), Avalanche (AVAX), and Base (BASE), revealed a total of 62 million acquired users. Flipside observed that user acquisition peaked in May but gradually declined afterward.\n\nNotably, Flipside suggested a connection between the surge in acquired users starting in March and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The event potentially eroded confidence in centralized entities, prompting a shift towards decentralized custody alternatives.\n\nBase, launched in August, also exhibited a strong start, but its user volume dwindled in the final months of 2023. Flipside speculated that the waning user growth for Base might be attributed to renewed enthusiasm for more established chains towards the end of the year.\n\nFlipside Predicts Trends for 2024\n\nIn its predictions for future trends, Flipside observed a decline in NFT-related activities and a shift towards decentralized finance (DeFi) activities during 2023. Anticipating the upcoming cycle, Flipside suggested that DeFi activities would continue to dominate, surpassing the prominence of NFT trading.\n\nSpecifically, it highlighted decentralized exchange (DEX) trading and yield farming as ongoing predominant applications while also forecasting the emergence of new DeFi applications like the Ethereum restaking protocol Eigenlayer.\n\nAccording to Flipside, user behavior in 2024 is expected to involve increased interaction with multiple blockchain networks, although most users will likely stick to engaging with a single chain.\n\nThe prediction further emphasized a growing trend of user interaction with Layer 2 networks in the coming year.\n\nDespite being a minority in 2023, users with more than one blockchain predominantly interacted with Layer 2s. Flipside speculated that rising transaction fees during the next crypto market bull run could lead Layer 2 networks to lower their costs for end users competitively, potentially driving increased interest in associated governance tokens."

The total miner earnings, which includes the fixed block rewards, spiked 35% in the last 10 days, as shown below.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the daily miner revenue has plummeted significantly since December last year, during which inscriptions craze had taken over blockchains.\n\nWhat to expect from Bitcoin next?\n\nBitcoin ascended to $42,000 as the weekend started, the first such instance in more than a week, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nWith this, the king coin\u2019s 24-hour gains surged to over 4%, reversing the losses made throughout the week.\n\nRead BTC\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nSince the day spot ETFs got regulatory approval to trade in the U.S., Bitcoin, ironically, has lost 14.5% of its value.\n\nWhile much of the blame went to outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, a recent report by CoinShares held macroeconomic factors equally responsible for the downturn."

        "title": "Ethereum Staking Provider Dumps Geth For Besu As Client Decentralization Race Heats Up - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nIn a move towards a more diversified Ethereum execution client ecosystem, AllNodes, a staking provider, has announced its complete transition from Geth to Besu. With this shift, AllNodes has eliminated the use of Geth across its entire network of 23,895 nodes, marking a milestone in the ongoing efforts to reduce the current centralization around Geth, a majority client.\n\nAllNodes Migrates To Besu\n\nIn a post on X, the non-custodial staking provider said the decision is a testament to the growing recognition of the need for a more robust and decentralized Ethereum ecosystem. Though Geth is the most widely used execution client for Ethereum nodes, analysts are concerned about its dominance and potential security vulnerabilities should it fall prey to a bug.\n\nThe transition to Besu aligns with AllNodes\u2019 commitment to providing its clients with the most secure and reliable staking infrastructure. Besu, developed by ConsenSys, is a highly performant and secure execution client offering several advantages over Geth.\n\nThis development significantly boosts its decentralization efforts for Rocket Pool, an Ethereum staking protocol that utilizes mini pools. Rocket Pool\u2019s mini pool operators are free to leverage AllNodes\u2019 staking and node hosting services. Even if some of Rocket Pool\u2019s mini-pool operators still use Geth, the decision by AllNodes to switch to Besu further strengthens Ethereum\u2019s resilience against potential client-side failures.\n\nThe current landscape of Ethereum validators still heavily favors Geth. Data from Client Diversity shows that over 75% of all validators rely on this client. However, in light of the current realization that client failures can negatively impact the network\u2019s stability, more staking providers will likely diversify their base with others following AllNodes. If more validators are spread across Nethermind, Geth, Besu, and other clients, Ethereum will become more resistant to potential forks and security issues.\n\nNo Bailouts For Ethereum Node Operators If Geth Fails\n\nOne analyst on X, Marius, explained that anyone can use any client, even gravitating to the first and popular Ethereum execution client, Geth. However, the analyst insists there will be no \u201cbailouts\u201d if the network forks.\n\nA buggy Geth will inevitably expose validators to the risk of catastrophic losses, triggering a network fork since it already controls over 66% of nodes needed for finality. Validators running that client could face slashing penalties of up to 32 ETH, effectively wiping out their stake.\n\nThe Ethereum network usually \u201cslashes\u201d the stake of validator nodes should their reliability drop below 100%. The longer they are offline, the higher the slashing penalty."

        "title": "Ethereum Gas Fees: Challenges and Solutions in 2024 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Navigating Ethereum Gas Fees: Challenges and Solutions in the Year 2024\n\nEthereum, a pioneering blockchain platform, has long faced challenges with gas fees\u2014the transaction fees required to execute operations on the network. In 2024, the issues surrounding Ethereum gas fees persist, impacting user experience and hindering broader adoption. This article delves into the challenges posed by Ethereum gas fees and explores potential solutions that could shape the landscape of transaction costs on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Challenge of High Gas Fees:\n\nEthereum\u2019s popularity has led to increased congestion on its network, resulting in elevated gas fees. Users, developers, and businesses face the dilemma of high transaction costs, which can make certain operations economically unfeasible and deter potential users from engaging with decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nImpact on Decentralized Finance (DeFi):\n\nDecentralized Finance, a prominent sector on the Ethereum network, has been significantly impacted by soaring gas fees. DeFi transactions, which include activities like lending, trading, and yield farming, often incur substantial costs, limiting accessibility and participation.\n\nScalability Solutions:\n\nEthereum 2.0, an ambitious upgrade to Ethereum, aims to address scalability challenges through the transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). While this transition is ongoing, layer 2 scaling solutions such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups are being implemented to alleviate congestion and reduce gas fees.\n\nOptimistic Rollups:\n\nOptimistic Rollups are layer 2 scaling solutions that allow for faster and cheaper transactions by processing most transactions off-chain and then submitting a summary to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach aims to maintain security while significantly reducing gas fees.\n\nzk-Rollups:\n\nZero-Knowledge Rollups, or zk-Rollups, utilize advanced cryptographic techniques to bundle multiple transactions into a single proof, which is then submitted to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach enhances scalability and reduces gas fees while preserving a high level of security.\n\nEIP-1559 and Fee Burn Mechanism:\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 is another significant upgrade designed to improve the user experience and address gas fee concerns. EIP-1559 introduces a fee burn mechanism that aims to make gas fees more predictable by adjusting the supply of Ethereum based on network demand.\n\nUser Education and Optimization:\n\nEducating users on gas fee optimization strategies is crucial. Implementing tools and practices such as choosing optimal transaction times, utilizing gas fee prediction platforms, and leveraging wallet features for fee adjustments can empower users to navigate Ethereum\u2019s fee landscape more effectively.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, addressing the challenges posed by gas fees remains a top priority. The ongoing development of Ethereum 2.0, the implementation of layer 2 scaling solutions, and the introduction of EIP-1559 are promising steps toward creating a more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly Ethereum network. Navigating the challenges of gas fees in 2024 requires a collaborative effort from developers, users, and the broader Ethereum community to foster a sustainable and inclusive blockchain ecosystem.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

In this article, we'll explore the factors driving Retik Finance's surge, the significance of the analysts' prediction, and what it means for the broader cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nRetik Finance Unveiled: A Deeper Dive\n\nBefore we delve into the details of the analysts' predictions, it's crucial to understand what sets Retik Finance apart in the competitive realm of decentralised finance. At its core, Retik Finance offers a comprehensive ecosystem that includes Retik Pay, a crypto payment processor, and the $RETIK token, serving as the backbone of the entire platform.\n\nRetik Pay's Disruptive Impact on Online Payments\n\nRetik Pay has emerged as a transformative force, reshaping the landscape of online payments. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, Retik Pay facilitates seamless, secure, and cost-effective transactions. Boasting features such as a minimal 1% transaction fee, support for a variety of cryptocurrencies, and global accessibility, it has become an attractive option for merchants seeking to embrace the future of online transactions.\n\nThe $RETIK Token: Engine of the Ecosystem\n\nCentral to Retik Finance is the $RETIK token, a versatile digital asset with a total supply of 1 billion tokens. The $RETIK token plays a pivotal role in enabling transactions, influencing the platform's trajectory through governance mechanisms, and providing incentives and rewards to users. It transcends being just a digital asset, acting as the catalyst that fuels innovation, participation, and financial autonomy within the Retik Finance ecosystem.\n\nCertiK Audit and Market Presence: Building Trust and Credibility\n\nOne of the cornerstones of Retik Finance's credibility is its completion of a comprehensive security audit by CertiK, a renowned blockchain auditing firm. CertiK's thorough analysis of Retik Finance's code has resulted in the platform receiving the coveted CertiK seal of approval. This audit not only enhances the trustworthiness of the project but also provides investors with a heightened sense of security.Furthermore, Retik Finance's presence on Coinmarketcap and Coingecko, two prominent cryptocurrency tracking platforms, adds to its visibility and presence in the market. These listings offer investors easy access to vital information, contributing to the overall legitimacy of the project.\n\nPresale Triumphs and Fund Accumulation\n\nIn an impressive display of momentum, Retik Finance has experienced remarkable success during its presale stages. Within less than 40 days, the platform sold out a substantial 220,107,967 RETIK tokens, amassing an impressive presale fund of $13,176,124. This surge in interest and the potential for continued growth has undoubtedly caught the attention of Wall Street analysts.\n\nAnalysts' Bold Prediction: A 5000% Breakout\n\nThe standout element of Retik Finance's recent surge is the audacious prediction by Wall Street analysts, forecasting a potential 5000% breakout for its $0.09 token. To put this in perspective, such a breakout would elevate Retik Finance into the echelons of top-tier cryptocurrencies, joining the ranks of A-list cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ethereum.\n\nFactors Driving the Bullish Prediction:\n\nInnovative Features of Retik Pay: The disruptive features of Retik Pay, including low transaction fees, global accessibility, and enhanced security, position it as a formidable player in the crypto payment processing sector. The versatility of the $RETIK Token: The $RETIK token's multifunctionality, serving as a transaction currency, governance mechanism, and incentive provider, creates a dynamic ecosystem that attracts user engagement and adoption. Validation through CertiK Audit: The completion of a CertiK audit provides a stamp of approval, emphasising Retik Finance's commitment to security and transparency, crucial factors in attracting institutional and retail investors. Market Presence on Leading Platforms: Presence on Coinmarketcap and Coingecko enhances Retik Finance's visibility, making it more accessible to a broader audience of potential investors. Impressive Presale Success: The quick sellout of tokens and the substantial presale fund accumulated demonstrate investor confidence and interest in the project's potential.\n\nConclusion: Retik Finance's Ascent to Prominence\n\nRetik Finance's journey from a promising DeFi project to a contender for the next major breakout is marked by innovative features, a robust ecosystem, and strong market fundamentals. The bold prediction by Wall Street analysts underscores the potential for Retik Finance to join the esteemed ranks of A-list cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ethereum. As the crypto community watches with anticipation, Retik Finance continues to redefine decentralised finance, providing users with new opportunities for financial empowerment and participation in the expanding digital economy.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Lucas Kiely, the Chief Investment Officer for Yield App, shared his insights on the potential approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in an opinion piece published by Cointelegraph on 23 January 2024. His perspective comes from a background of extensive experience in investment portfolio management and a deep understanding of the crypto market.\n\nKiely began by acknowledging the recent approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, a development that was long-awaited and somewhat unexpected in the industry. He then shifted focus to the next significant milestone for the crypto market: the approval of an Ether spot ETF. Contrary to the prolonged and contentious process that surrounded the Bitcoin ETF, Kiely believes the approval of an ETH spot ETF is not only certain but imminent.\n\nHe criticized the SEC\u2019s past denials of Bitcoin ETF applications, which he attributed to prejudice against Bitcoin. This prejudice, according to Kiely, was finally overcome due to Greyscale\u2019s lawsuit. He referenced Commissioner Hester Peirce\u2019s critique of the SEC\u2019s handling of these approvals, noting that the denials never made sense and eroded trust in the SEC. Peirce\u2019s comments highlighted the unnecessary complexity and \u201ccircus\u201d surrounding crypto products, which Kiely believes will not be the case with an Ether ETF.\n\nKiely said that there are currently seven ETH spot ETF applications on the SEC\u2019s desk, with VanEck\u2019s application being the first in line with a deadline of 23 May 2024. Kiely pointed out that the SEC has already instituted proceedings on VanEck\u2019s applications, making it difficult for the regulator to find a reason for denial without affecting other pending applications. This situation, he argues, is why the market is confident about an approval in May.\n\nKiely also mentioned that the approval of an ETH product would pave the way for a variety of crypto-backed or linked Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs), from spot products to more complex instruments. He acknowledged that liquidity might be the only potential obstacle for an ETH spot ETF approval. He mentioned that Ethereum\u2019s move to proof-of-stake has constrained the supply of ETH, and unlike Bitcoin, which is used mainly as a store of value, ETH is a working currency used for transactions on its chain. However, Kiely views this concern as a long shot and not significantly different from liquidity issues in equity markets.\n\nHe concluded by stating that the delay in approving a Bitcoin ETF was due to politics and the SEC\u2019s uncertainty about embracing this new asset class. With the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., he believes that cryptocurrency has not only entered traditional finance (TradFi) but is now firmly established within it. Kiely anticipates not just the approval of a spot ETH ETF but a full-scale institutional colonization of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nFeatured Image via Pixabay"

        "content": "In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, investors and enthusiasts are closely monitoring the movements of Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Shiba Inu as these digital assets navigate critical junctures in the market. Recent price fluctuations and technical indicators signal potential shifts in momentum, prompting speculation and caution among traders worldwide.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, finds itself at a pivotal moment as it grapples with key support levels and market sentiment. The 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a crucial indicator of short-term momentum, is currently under scrutiny. A breach of this level could see Ethereum\u2019s value dip to $2,347, potentially triggering a more pronounced decline. With buying pressure showing signs of weakening, investors are closely monitoring Ethereum\u2019s ability to reclaim bullish momentum and overcome resistance levels, particularly the recent high of $2,547.6.\n\nDespite the rise of layer 2 networks aimed at enhancing scalability and efficiency, Ethereum\u2019s trajectory reflects subdued market energy, contributing to cautious trading sentiments among investors. Additional support and resistance zones provide further insight into potential price movements, with $2,175.2 and $2,000 emerging as critical support levels in the event of a downturn.\n\nBitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, faces its own set of challenges as it hovers near the critical $40,000 mark. The loss of support at the 50-day Exponential Moving Average signals a potential shift in sentiment, with the 100-day EMA offering a tentative foothold for price stability. However, market liquidity remains a concern, hindering Bitcoin\u2019s ability to mount a strong rebound. Resistance at $42,786 presents a significant hurdle for Bitcoin\u2019s recovery, highlighting the importance of monitoring key support levels, notably $35,888, in the event of further downward pressure.\n\nShiba Inu, a meme-inspired token, grapples with its own market dynamics amid a challenging landscape characterized by low liquidity and lack of growth catalysts. Current trading patterns suggest a delicate balance between bullish and bearish sentiment, with support at $0.000027 and $0.000022 offering potential accumulation points for buyers. Resistance at $0.000035 presents a formidable challenge for Shiba Inu\u2019s upward trajectory, emphasizing the need for vigilance and strategic decision-making among investors.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and adapt to changing dynamics, staying informed about price movements, technical indicators, and market sentiment is essential for investors and traders alike. Whether Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Shiba Inu, each digital asset faces its own set of challenges and opportunities, shaping the broader landscape of the crypto market.\n\nDespite the challenging market landscape, there\u2019s a glimmer of hope for Shiba Inu. The descending trading volume accompanying its price consolidation hints at a potential waning of bearish momentum. This slowdown often precedes a stabilization or even a reversal if bullish forces take control.\n\nCurrently finding support around $0.000027, Shiba Inu faces a critical test. If this level fails, the next support zone lies near $0.000022, potentially offering a new accumulation point for buyers. On the resistance side, breaking the $0.000035 barrier could pave the way for a retest of higher levels, possibly around $0.000040.\n\nInvestors in Shiba Inu are advised to closely monitor these price levels, as they could provide insights into the token\u2019s short-term trajectory and potential opportunities for traders.\n\nIn conclusion, navigating the cryptocurrency market requires diligence, patience, and a keen understanding of market trends. As Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Shiba Inu navigate critical junctures, investors are advised to exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and stay informed to"
