        "content": "The S&P 500 metric showed a price correction while Ethereum continued an uptrend.\n\nPercent Supply in Profit was over 67% at press time, representing a four-month high for Ethereum.\n\nThe price of Ethereum [ETH] rose dramatically over the last few days, which indicated a bull trend. Consequently, the recent activity of the S&P 500 metric and its correlation with crypto may provide some indication as to the same.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum and equity prices go in opposite directions\n\nRecent information indicated that Ethereum\u2019s price was trending opposite to the S&P 500. Per Santiment\u2019s data, at press time, the price of the S&P 500 index underwent a correction following its previous rising trajectory.\n\nWhen the S&P 500 (a proxy for equities) and cryptocurrency show no relationship to one another, a bull market is said to have begun.\n\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 (S&P 500) measures the collective stock market performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded corporations in the United States. The index components are chosen by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an S & P Global division, and broadly represent the U.S. stock market.\n\nPercent Supply in Profit hits four-month high\n\nBesides the stock market\u2019s movement, the percentage of supply in profit is a leading sign of an Ethereum bull run. Over 67% of the Percent Supply was profitable, as evidenced by data from Glassnode.\n\nThe graph also showed that the present level of the Percent Supply in profit was at its highest in four months. The significance of this statistic in evaluating the Ethereum bull run is that the greater the Percent Supply in profit, the more likely a bull run is in play.\n\nMVRV shows reduced loss\n\nWhen the 365-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is included, the case for a bull market becomes stronger. The MVRV ratio was roughly 6.3% at the time of writing. The current MVRV level indicated a 6% decrease in the value of Ethereum.\n\nThough a loss, the stretch to recoup the earlier loss suggested a bull market. However, it would be a complete run when it turned the holdings in the 365-day period into profit.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nEthereum remains in the overbought zone\n\nA daily timeframe chart of Ethereum\u2019s price showed that it was trading near $1,550 as of this writing. The current price region represented a gain of nearly 30% at press time, as calculated using the Price Range tool.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings indicated that the price was relatively stable in the overbought territory."
