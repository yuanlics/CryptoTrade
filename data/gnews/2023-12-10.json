        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe integrity of the Ethereum blockchain network is under threat after Truth Labs conducted a thorough investigation and discovered multiple fraudulent activities within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDriven by growing concerns about security, the investigation uncovered a startling pattern of illicit activities, such as theft, scams, and dishonest marketing.\n\nWe began our deep research into Ethereum when it became far to dangerous to participate in the ecosystem with any relevant % of my wealth. Fraud was running rampant in every Sector of the Ecosystem. Wallets, Layer 2's, Bridge's, Protocols across the board using ERC20 Standard,\u2026 \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) November 14, 2023\n\nThe investigation conducted by Truth Labs showed that these illegal activities are present in many areas of the Ethereum platform. Among the areas affected are wallets, bridges, Layer 2 solutions, and protocols that use the ERC20 standard. Moreover, stablecoins, wrapped tokens, NFT-selling protocols, and both centralized and decentralized exchanges have yet to be spared.\n\nIn addition, the Truth Labs report has clouded the reputations of notable Ethereum community members. There have been allegations of pump-and-dump schemes, which has led to concerns about the moral character of these influential individuals. The discussion about these people\u2019s accountability for opposing and combating such dishonest practices has been spurred by this circumstance.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Truth Labs\u2019 findings go beyond ideas. An actor and wallet network disproportionately connected to fraudulent activity on Ethereum has been found and documented. Understanding and possibly preventing the spread of such malpractices within the ecosystem is made possible by using this database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, these revelations have numerous ramifications. They have rekindled conversations about the necessity of ethics and transparency in the crypto space, particularly among Ethereum users. These days, the main worries are about the platform\u2019s overall integrity and the safety of funds.\n\nFurther raising concerns is the fact that some influential individuals involved in these schemes are anonymous. It highlights the difficulties in policing and overseeing a decentralized and frequently opaque digital environment. One of the biggest obstacles to solving the problems ailing the Ethereum ecosystem is this lack of transparency.\n\nAs such, there is a fork in the road for the Ethereum community. As a result of Truth Labs\u2019 disclosures, there is now a need for a coordinated effort to tackle the network\u2019s vulnerabilities and illegal activities. According to the report, leaders and influencers in the Ethereum community must promote a more open and moral environment."

        "content": "This week\u2019s Web3 watch begins with a significant shift in the NFT marketplace. Ethereum, traditionally the frontrunner in NFT trading, has seen a downturn in sales volume, facing competition from two emerging players.\n\nThe Bitcoin network witnessed a surge in digital art collectible trading, primarily driven by ongoing interest in ordinal inscriptions. Ordinals allow users to mint NFT-like assets directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. The past month has seen a 500% increase in sales volume for this asset class, eclipsing Ethereum\u2019s figures over the same timeframe.\n\nThe popularity of Bitcoin\u2019s cheap-to-mint ordinal inscriptions has led to a significant increase in demand on the network. This trend reflects a broader shift in the digital collectibles market, where novel and cost-effective methods of NFT creation and trading are gaining traction.\n\nRead more: Sotheby\u2019s announces its first Bitcoin Ordinals sale\n\nThe Solana blockchain has also stepped into the spotlight, recording higher NFT trading volumes than Ethereum on Friday. This increase in Solana\u2019s trading volume is the culmination of a banner week for the network.\n\n\u201cSomething that\u2019s obviously interesting and different in the ordinals space versus every other popular blockchain is that your NFTs are actually stored on-chain versus in smart contracts-enabled ecosystems, [where] they\u2019re stored on some decentralized server like IPFS,\u201d Sarah Satoshi, the head of business development at ordinals marketplace Gamma.io, said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the factors that attracts a lot of people.\u201d\n\nLiquid staking protocol Jito executed an airdrop on Thursday, distributing $165 million worth of its native token to users. The following day, Solana saw a spike in its NFT sales, processing nearly $15 million in transactions.\n\nThere was a marked increase in activity on Tensor, a Solana-based NFT market, which may have been fueled by speculations of another potential airdrop.\n\nOn Friday, \u201cTensorians,\u201d a Solana-based NFT collection, topped the sales volume charts according to CryptoSlam. The collection\u2019s sales volume rose over 100% in the past week.\n\nPudgy Penguins takes up the Webkinz model\n\nThe NFT collection Pudgy Penguins debuted an online open-world game called Pudgy World Alpha at Art Basel Miami.\n\nThe game lets players control avatar lookalikes of the penguins, but users don\u2019t need to own an NFT to play.\n\nPudgy World builds on the NFT collection\u2019s partnership bringing toy versions of Pudgy Penguins to Walmart stores. Each toy comes with a QR code that claims a Pudgy Penguin character inside of Pudgy World.\n\nEvery toy corresponds to a Pudgy Penguins NFT, and holders receive licensing royalties on their corresponding toys, the project said in a press statement.\n\nOne interesting stat:\n\nInterest in Bitcoin ordinals dramatically increased the blockchain\u2019s mempool to an all-time high. Mempools collect all unconfirmed transactions waiting to be validated and added to a blockchain. When too many transactions are added, it becomes congested, leading to slower processing times and higher fees for prioritizing transactions.\n\nAlso of note:\n\nRecordpool released the Jackson 5\u2019s first ever studio recording as a digital collectible on Web3 music marketplace anotherblock.\n\nThe digital art arm of Sotheby\u2019s is auctioning off its first set of ordinal inscriptions.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) faces possible sell pressure, one crypto analyst says, citing how it surpassed the $2,300 mark. Whales have been actively taking profit, and this could trigger a massive sell pressure on the world\u2019s second-largest crypto.\n\nEthereum price volatility\n\nThe price of Ethereum has been positively impacted by the recent bullish momentum in the global crypto markets, fueled by Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) surge above the $43,000 price region.\n\nETH maintains a distinctive market position attributed to its extensive developer community, widespread adoption, and pivotal role in decentralized finance (defi) and various blockchain applications.\n\nDespite the current positive momentum, there are apprehensions regarding the potential influence of selling pressure from whales on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, whales immediately took profits after Ethereum hit $2,300.\n\nThe impact of significant holders selling could potentially drive down the price of ETH in the coming weeks. In a bearish scenario, the cryptocurrency might retest the $1,555 support level, and sustained selling pressure could push ETH as low as $1,460 within the next two months, the analyst predicts.\n\nDespite these concerns, the overall market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, leaving room for potential further growth in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nAs #Ethereum surpassed $2,300, $ETH whales began to book profits. This surge in selling pressure might soon start to impact the #ETH price. pic.twitter.com/sdrvT2vcCe \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 10, 2023\n\nAlthough Ether\u2019s market capitalization of $282 billion lags behind Bitcoin\u2019s $857 billion, both networks generate comparable protocol revenues.\n\nIn the last seven days, the Bitcoin network accrued $61 million in fees, while Ethereum accumulated $61.5 million.\n\nIn addition to institutional interest, the price surge is fueled by expectations of an ETF approval from the SEC. Despite the optimistic momentum, there are apprehensions, that the upswing in selling pressure might have repercussions on the ETH price in the coming days.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum scaling startup Versace Labs secured another $2.3m in seed round\n\nEthereum\u2019s surging network fees\n\nThe rise in Ethereum\u2019s network fees is intricately tied to the expansion of its DeFi ecosystem and the widespread adoption of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nIncreased defi and NFT activities have driven up network fees, with more individuals engaging in intricate transactions, leading to prolonged periods of elevated fees.\n\nThe creation, transfer, and trading of NFTs involve smart contract executions that consume gas, and the associated costs can fluctuate based on network congestion and gas prices. While Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees pose challenges for NFT creators and collectors, emerging solutions like Layer 2 scaling and gas optimization provide optimism for a more cost-effective and accessible NFT ecosystem.\n\nThe surge in DeFi and NFT activity on the Ethereum network since 2020 has resulted in extensive transaction activity, contributing to the persistently high gas fees.\n\nCurrently, the average gas fee for minting an NFT on Ethereum is around $100, subject to variations based on network congestion, gas prices, and smart contract complexity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,348.23, according to Data from CoinGecko.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"
