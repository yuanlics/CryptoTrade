        "content": "Popular crypto influence said that the Shibarium bridge will allow easy transfer of assets between Ethereum and Shibarium.\n\nAs the launch of Shibarium nears, more market payers are coming to the front to extend support to the Layer-2 protocol.\n\nThe Shiba Inu developers have been working hard on the development of the Layer-2 scalability platform Shibarium recently. Popular crypto influencer SHIB Knight also noted that the team behind the crypto project is also working on a bridge that will allow users to move assets between Ethereum and Shibarium.\n\nSHIB Knight shared information and details regarding a new meme-based crypto project willing to expand the utility of Shibarium. In his tweet today, SHIB Knight noted that the team behind the community-focused project \u2013 Kai Ken Inu \u2013 will be building the Shibarium Bridge.\n\nWith the bridge solution that links the Shiba Inu Layer-2 network and Ethereum, users will be able to \u201cport assets\u201d directly from the Ethereum blockchain to Shibarium. \u201c[Kai Ken Inu is] building a Shibarium bridge, which will allow holders to port assets from [Ethereum] to Shibarium when it launches,\u201d SHIB Knight tweeted.\n\nNote that Shiba Inu has yet to confirm the launch of such a bridge solution in the market. There\u2019s been a lot of uproars recently as the launch of Shibarium nears. Much recently, crypto hardware wallet provider Ledger also stated that it will be offering support to the Shibarium protocol. Shibarium is slowly getting recognition in the market as crypto enthusiasts are eager to know how well it can cater to the requirements of the Web3 space.\n\nKAIK Token Value Jumps 1000x\n\nAlthough the news of Shibarium bridge is not yet official, the members of Shiba Inu community celebrated and showed excitement regarding the upcoming project. The excitement has led to the widespread adoption of KAIK, the native cryptocurrency of Kai Ken Inu.\n\nCrypto influencer SHIB Knight claimed that the price of the KAIK token has jumped by 1000x since its launch. Additionally, the Shiba Inu influencer also noted that Kai Ken Inu\u2019s market cap jumped from $2 million to a staggering $10 million yesterday. \u201cKAIK is already 1000x up from launch. [It] ran to a $10M [market cap]yesterday from $2M [market cap], with a healthy and bullish chart,\u201d SHIB Knight noted.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/army_shiba/status/1618106378362695680\n\nThe community team behind Kai Ken Inu has also confirmed the massive rally and the appreciation of the token\u2019s valuations. Besides, the community also expressed gratitude to all members of the crypto community, especially the SHIBArmy.\n\nThey also assured the KAIK holders that there are greater things to come ahead in the market.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

Today, mining of crypto exists on a digital plane, the geography and metrics have changed but the ethos and sense that \u2013 for a select and determined few gargantuan gains can be made \u2013 remains the same.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) has so far teased 9 presale stages with growing anticipation and interest.

This mischievous kitten enjoys her fish, and as such wants to ensure that there is a plentitude of healthy fish in this world.\n\nUnlike Big Eyes two bigger brothers Doge and Shiba Inu, this token is yet to launch meaning its current token price is devastatingly and disgustingly low.

If however, it dips below $23,000 the market confidence could trigger a domino effect and immediate sell off that could see its value dwindle paving the way for Ethereum to exercise more bolshy market dominance having been seen as the little tike to Bitcoins (BTC) big bully brother for so long.\n\nThe token to keep your eyes on and your wallets aligned with is Big Eyes.
