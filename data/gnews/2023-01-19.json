        "title": "Soaring growth of Ethereum layer-2 networks set to continue in 2023 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ethereum layer-2 networks have gone through an explosive growth phase over the past couple of months, a trend that is set to continue in 2023.\n\nAccording to recent data, the leading layer-2 networks have seen an increase in daily active users thathas translated into a growth in fees for the respective ecosystems.\n\nAccording to analytics provider Token Terminal, Polygon leads the pack with 313,457 daily active users as of Jan. 17, a metric that spiked to over 600,000 daily active users earlier in January.\n\nThat\u2019s a 30% increase in activity since the beginning of October, resulting in nearly $55,000 worth of daily fees for Polygon.\n\nOptimism has seen even faster growth, with a 190% gain in daily active users over the past three months. This resulted in daily network fees of $119,475, a gain of almost 140% since the beginning of the year.\n\nArbitrum One currently has 41,694 daily active users, an increase of around 40% over the past three months. Daily fees on the network are just over $40,000, according to the data.\n\nMeanwhile, L2 ecosystem analytics platform L2beat states that Arbitrum has a market share of 52% in terms of total value locked (TVL), which is currently at $2.55 billion. Aribtrum has seen a 9% increase in TVL over the past week.\n\nOptimism, the second-largest L2 network, has a TVL of $1.46 billion, giving it a market share of 30%. Its collateral locked has surged by 15% over the past seven days.\n\nThe two together account for more than 80% of all the collateral locked in layer-2 platforms.\n\nRelated: Optimism and Arbitrum flip Ethereum in combined transaction volume\n\nThere has been an increase of almost 10% in TVL for all L2s over the past week, pushing the total TVL up to $4.89 billion. However, that figure is still down 34% since its peak in April.\n\nNevertheless, this decline is less than half of the retreat DeFi TVL has made since its all-time high. DeFi collateral has declined by 75% since December 2021, according to DeFiLlama, suggesting that there is greater demand and momentum for layer-2 networks at the moment."

Discover SCENE\n\nNational Australia Bank (NAB) will become the second of the country\u2019s major financial institutions to launch a stablecoin, a top executive told the Australian Financial Review (AFR).\n\nThe coin, dubbed AUDN, will launch on the Ethereum and Algorand blockchains later this year.\n\nHoward Silby, NAB\u2019s chief innovation officer, told AFR the stablecoin would allow customers to settle transactions on the blockchain in real-time, using Australian dollars.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNAB will be the second of Australia\u2019s big four banks to launch a stablecoin, after rival Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ) minted its own, dubbed A$DC, last year.\n\nEarly uses of A$DC indicate that Aussie dollar stablecoins could play a role in Australia\u2019s energy transition plans. In June, an investor used the stablecoin to purchase carbon credits.\n\nNAB\u2019s stablecoin will also allow for carbon credit trading, the AFR reported. Other functions could include cross-border payments and repurchase agreements.\n\nIndividual banks are working on their own stablecoins after a failed attempt to cooperate on a single industry-wide Australian dollar stablecoin. The project never got off the ground due to competition concerns and the different stages each bank was at in its crypto strategy.\n\nDecrypt has contacted NAB for further comment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAustralia dives head first into crypto\n\nUnder Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who came to power last May, Australia has pledged to modernize the country\u2019s financial system and update its regulatory framework to adapt to crypto and other innovations.\n\nMeanwhile, the country's central bank is moving ahead with a central bank digital currency (CBDC) project. A pilot of the scheme is due to be completed by mid-2023.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t all been plain sailing for crypto projects down under.\n\nIn November last year, the asset manager behind two of the country\u2019s first crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) applied to delist the investment vehicles after just six months of trading, due to the global bear market.\n\nA few days later, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) ditched a long-running project to update its clearing system using blockchain, incurring a write-off of $170 million."

        "content": "A new annual report from early-stage venture firm Electric Capital shows massive developer activity growth on four blockchain projects, including two Ethereum (ETH) rivals.\n\nAccording to the firm, active developers on the Polygon (MATIC) and Cosmos (ATOM) blockchains along with ETH rivals Solana (SOL) and Polkadot (DOT) shot up in 2022 by more than 400% from five years ago.\n\nSays Maria Shen, an investor at Electric Capital,\n\n\u201cWhile prices are at 2018 levels, developer ecosystems are multiples bigger.\u201d\n\nThese four blockchain projects each saw less than 200 monthly developers in 2018, but that increased to more than 1,000 in 2012.\n\nAccording to the report, Polygon has just over 1,000 monthly active developers, Cosmos just under 2,000, Polkadot about 2,000 and Solana about 2,250.\n\nIn the crypto space as a whole, developer activity started off at 1,000 monthly active developers writing code in the first seven years of the nascent technology. Now, as of December 2022, there were 23,343 monthly active developers, a 5% growth compared to December 2021, the report says.\n\nDevelopment activity on a blockchain is one indicator that a crypto project will experience a price increase.\n\nSays the report,\n\n\u201cDevelopers are a leading indicator of value creation. Developers build apps that deliver value to users. Killer apps attract customers, and those customers bring more developers.\u201d\n\nShen says the firm\u2019s development activity tally is likely an undercount since it solely tracks open-source code.\n\n\u201cWe focus on open source code, so we undercount total developers in crypto and do not count designers, community mods, PMs [project managers], etc. We focus on unique code and do not count forked code.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nNYX Professional Makeup is launching an online beauty \u201cincubator\u201d in the form of a DAO called GORJS, as well as 1,000 Ethereum NFTs called the \u201cFKWME Pass,\u201d the L'Or\u00e9al-owned brand announced Thursday.\n\nGORJS, pronounced \u201cgorgeous,\u201d aims to set a precedent for \u201cwhat beauty will be in the metaverse, and lead the cultural conversation as it relates to the values of diversity, inclusivity, and accessibility,\u201d according to the DAO\u2019s litepaper, or technical explanation.\n\nThe DAO was first announced last June, but it\u2019s finally launching in the near future with the same vision intact. The FKWME NFT passes will be released to the public on February 1, with a price of 0.19 ETH\u2014about $290 each at present.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, NYX Global Brand President Yann Joffredo said GORJS was created to shine a light on \u201c3D creators\u201d and give them \u201ca path to success within the Web3 ecosystem.\u201d\n\nJoffredo sees digital \u201cmakeup\u201d designs as being radically different from what's possible with physical cosmetics, because creators can go above and beyond with surreal elements that defy the laws of physics.\n\n\u201cFrom extraterrestrial glass skin to morphing elemental lashes, makeup and digital fantasy are entwined in an aspirational, accessible way,\u201d Joffredo told Decrypt via email. \u201cIn one instance, eyelashes might be stacked in a multi-tier beauty application norm; in Web3, they could dramatically flare into lifelike flames that dare the viewer to dream.\u201d\n\nNYX\u2019s DAO, then, is a move beyond physical cosmetics sold at drug stores\u2014an exploration of what makeup means in the digital age of avatars and pseudonymity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe believe that a new generation of Web3 creators will help redefine beauty,\u201d Joffredo told Decrypt.\n\nThis Web3 push also appears to be a move away from NYX\u2019s traditional diet of beauty influencer content, which typically consists of smartphone footage of creators applying makeup shared to Web2 social media platforms like TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nWhen asked how NYX\u2019s DAO and NFTs align with the brand\u2019s demographic, Joffredo said that NYX has always been a \u201cpioneer in the digital and aspiring artistry space.\u201d Joffredo also said NYX has a history of supporting \u201crising makeup creators\u201d and \u201cyoung creators\u201d in the beauty industry.\n\nDespite the decline of the NFT market over the past several months, Joffredo believes GORJS will still be able to deliver on its ambitious vision.\n\nThe Ethereum DAO\u2019s members will use non-transferable GORJS governance tokens\u2014capped at a total supply of 100 million\u2014as voting chips for various DAO proposals and projects. A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is a group of crypto enthusiasts who attempt collective governance over pooled resources using tokens for community voting.\n\nIn an ideal DAO structure, there is no single entity that holds all the power, and the community is able to execute on a common goal or mission\u2014whether it's supporting a protocol, collecting valuable assets, etc.\u2014using a more egalitarian power structure instead of a top-down one.\n\nImage: GORGJS DAO.\n\nDAO members can earn the \u201csoulbound\u201d GORJS tokens in a variety of ways, including by purchasing a FKWME Pass NFT (pronounced \u201cfuck with me\u201d). If a token is \u201csoulbound,\u201d it means it\u2019s non-transferable and cannot be moved from the holder\u2019s wallet.\n\nJoffredo told Decrypt the FKWME name was chosen because it\u2019s \u201ca casual phrase used when you want others to share the same vision as you: to join you, connect with you, and vibe with you on a social level.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe NFT automatically grants the holder a daily yield of GORJS tokens, and also allowlists the holder for future NFT airdrops and exclusive future sales. The DAO will also offer an NFT minting tool, allowing members to mint their art through its site.\n\nSomething new in beauty just dropped\ud83d\udc40\n\nINTRODUCING GORJS \u2728 Want to find out what we mean?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/WApCVh5CTZ #TheFutureIsGORJS #LFG pic.twitter.com/hyNSwkA1u9 \u2014 NYX Pro Makeup US (@NYXCosmetics) January 10, 2023\n\nGORJS founding members include NYX\u2019s Joffredo, NYX Global VP of Digital and Ecommerce Matthieu Guerin, and three other NYX executives. Each NYX executive will hold 2% of the total token supply at launch.\n\nThe DAO also has a number of Web3-focused executives on its advisory team, including The Sandbox co-founder Sebastien Borget, Ready Player Me founder Timmu Toke, Polygon Labs Metaverse Lead Brian Trunzo, and Amber Ward, CEO of creative agency Invisible North.\n\n\u201cI decided to join as [an] advisor because they are genuinely purpose-driven,\u201d Borget told Decrypt in a message. \u201cI believe they have designed a DAO system which truly benefits the digital talent, creators, and artists.\u201d\n\nWard told Decrypt that NYX isn\u2019t necessarily trying to target its retail customer base with its Web3 efforts.\n\n\u201cThe primary demographic for GORJS is creators and digital artists who are native to Web3,\u201d Ward said in a message. \u201cThis is a niche, long-term play.\u201d\n\nThe DAO\u2019s litepaper suggests it may lean heavily into \u201cartist referrals\u201d to grow its community, rewarding those who successfully bring their creative friends into the DAO with GORJS tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile this could be interpreted as a type of multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme, that\u2019s apparently not the case here because GORJS tokens cannot be converted into real funds. More referrals won\u2019t give members money directly, but it could lead to more individual power in the DAO.\n\nThe litepaper also explicitly states that GORJS tokens are not an \u201cinvestment\u201d and \u201cunder no circumstances are tokens able to be exchanged for any L\u2019Oreal equities, securities, or currency.\u201d\n\nBorget told Decrypt that the soulbound nature of the GORJS token solves what otherwise could lead to governance token speculation, which crypto founders like Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin have disparaged in recent months.\n\n\u201cThe governance is truly meant to be a recommendation engine through relying on [soulbound tokens] that cannot be sold, and hence does not risk becoming a financial instrument,\u201d Borget said.\n\nNYX\u2019s dive into Web3 aligns with parent company L'Or\u00e9al\u2019s fascination with crypto. L'Or\u00e9al is already involved in the metaverse and digital community-building space, having invested in metaverse startup Digital Village through its VC arm, Bold. It\u2019s also no surprise that NYX has entered Web3, considering L'Or\u00e9al\u2019s 17 trademark applications filed last year for NFTs and blockchain uses for its brands including NYX, Kiehl\u2019s, and Urban Decay.\n\nAs NYX moves forward with its Web3 plans, it remains unclear whether the average NYX customer is interested in crypto\u2014or whether NYX\u2019s Web3 world will garner a new demographic of users entirely.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to correct the list of project advisors following a last-minute change to the announcement materials."
