This withdrawal has reduced his Ethereum stake to 263,294 ETH, or $491.6 million at spot rates. The reasons for the withdrawal are unclear, but it could indicate Sun's intention to sell some of the ETH or transfer it to a different staking platform. Despite this transfer, Sun remains one of the largest stakers at Lido, accounting for over 9% of the total ETH staked. The Shanghai upgrade has allowed ETH holders to withdraw their assets, and despite earlier fears, the number of users staking ETH remains upward. However, the SEC's assessment that some proof-of-stake coins are unregistered securities has impacted ETH's price, along with other coins like Cardano's ADA and Algorand's ALGO."
