        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAshley Prosper, an XRP community member, highlighted factors from the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit that might affect Ethereum.\n\nThe Ripple lawsuit emphasized the nature of XRP\u2019s blind sales and lack of buyer knowledge.\n\nRipple\u2019s programmatic sales were less than 1% of global XRP trading.\n\nDiscussions around Ethereum\u2019s early sales are growing, with concerns about concealed major investments.\n\nEthereum\u2019s early sales are making waves in the cryptocurrency community, drawing insights from recent SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit developments. Ashley Prosper, a prominent member of the XRP community, has shed light on five elements derived from the Ripple lawsuit, suggesting potential repercussions for Ethereum should the SEC decide to delve deeper into its past ICO dealings.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Spotlight: Ripple\u2019s Court Insights\n\nThe court\u2019s findings in the Ripple lawsuit emphasized several critical factors regarding Ripple\u2019s programmatic sales of XRP:\n\nThe nature of these sales was likened to blind bid/ask transactions, with buyers unaware if their funds were directed to the blockchain firm.\n\nSuch sales accounted for a mere sliver, less than 1%, of the global XRP trading activity.\n\nRipple, during these transactions, did not make any commitments or offers, primarily because the company lacked knowledge of the identities of those buying XRP on exchanges.\n\nA significant number of these buyers remained oblivious to Ripple\u2019s very existence.\n\nThese XRP sales didn\u2019t follow any contracts with clauses like lockup provisions or explicit statements of purpose.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Sales: A Subject of Contention\n\nAdding fuel to the Ethereum sales discourse was former Ethereum adviser Steven Nerayoff. He presented the inherent difficulty in pinpointing the exact number of Ethereum ICO buyers. His insights stirred debates and led to suspicions that some major players, or \u201cwhales\u201d, could be concealing their Ethereum positions.\n\nThe juxtaposition of the Ripple lawsuit\u2019s findings with Ethereum\u2019s historical sales opens a Pandora\u2019s box of questions and potential regulatory scrutiny. Should the SEC choose to probe Ethereum\u2019s past based on these Ripple precedents, Ethereum might find itself in a regulatory maze, raising concerns for its investors and stakeholders in the crypto industry."

        "content": "Sun\u2019s actions have raised eyebrows as he has withdrawn millions from Lido Finance without selling.\n\nA mysterious connection has emerged as another entity has swiftly reshuffled ETH assets on Huobi.\n\nButerin, in contrast, has opted for smaller transfers, maintaining an air of enigma.\n\nIn a startling twist of events, two prominent figures in the blockchain space, TRON founder Justin Sun and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, have recently made headlines by orchestrating Ethereum (ETH) transfers from their well-known digital wallets.\n\nJustin Sun Withdraws $37.7M in Ethereum from Lido Finance\n\nJustin Sun initiated a substantial withdrawal from Lido Finance, totaling 23,000 ETH, equivalent to a staggering $37.7 million. The entirety of this significant sum was then transferred to a new destination, identified as address 0x454. Remarkably, despite this sizable transaction, Sun chose not to liquidate his ETH holdings.\n\nIntriguingly, another address associated with HTX (Huobi) conducted a withdrawal of 42,999 ETH from Binance shortly after Sun\u2019s ETH deposit into Binance, subsequently reallocating these assets to Lido for staking purposes.\n\nThis recent development marks another instance of Justin Sun\u2019s impactful financial maneuvers. Two days prior, on October 5, Sun withdrew another substantial tranche of 19,000 ETH, totaling $32.8 million, from Lido Finance, subsequently depositing these funds into Binance.\n\nButerin\u2019s Modest $1.64M Transfer Amid Crypto Cleaning\n\nBefore these actions, Sun had made a notable deposit of 5,000 ETH, equivalent to $9.2 million, into Huobi at an ETH price of $1,841 on August 12, 2023, just before the cryptocurrency market experienced a decline, resulting in ETH prices plummeting by more than 14%.\n\nIn contrast, Vitalik Buterin executed a comparatively modest transfer involving 1,000 ETH with a value of $1.64 million, directed towards address 0x556 on the same day. It\u2019s worth highlighting that Buterin has consistently deposited a cumulative total of 2.6 thousand ETH, equivalent to $4.2 million, into Bitstamp and Paxos through this specific address since September 17.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nJustin Sun\u2019s repeated withdrawals and deposits of significant amounts of ETH may be part of a strategic move to capitalize on market fluctuations.\n\nWith notable amounts of ETH being moved by both Sun and Buterin, there\u2019s potential for these actions to affect Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThese high-profile Ethereum transactions, involving influential figures like Justin Sun and Vitalik Buterin, underscore the dynamic nature of crypto. They shed light on the strategic moves of key players within the industry, potentially influencing market sentiment and investor behavior.\n\nTo learn more about Ether ETFs and their potential impact on institutional crypto adoption, read here:\n\nAre Ether ETFs Initiating an Institutional Surge in Crypto?\n\n\n\nAre you curious about the recent challenges facing the ETH burn mechanism amidst growing interest?

Discover SCENE\n\nIt was a week full of headlines in crypto, but they weren't being made by market stalwarts Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their stable values suggest cryptocurrencies are less reactive to the current news cycle than they were during its heady 2021 bull run and subsequent 2022 crash.\n\nMarket leader Bitcoin (BTC) grew a modest 2.7% over the seven days and now changes hands at $27,952. It briefly hit a two-month high on Sunday night when it crossed the $28,000 threshold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe closest contender Ethereum (ETH) had a comparably harder week and lost 2.1% to trade at $1,636 at the time of writing. Its weak performance comes despite several positive announcements, including a UBS asset tokenization trial supported by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the launch of nine Ethereum Futures ETFs in the U.S. on Monday.\n\nGrayscale announced on Monday that it hopes to convert its Ethereum trust into a spot ETF. The crypto asset manager\u2019s application stems from its courtroom victory back in August when it won an appeal against the Securities and Exchange Commission after the latter rejected its application to convert its Bitcoin trust into a spot ETF.\n\nThe SEC also lost an appeal in its lawsuit against XRP progenitor Ripple this week. The SEC had hoped in vain that Judge Torres would reconsider her ruling that selling XRP to retail consumers doesn\u2019t constitute a breach of American securities laws.\n\nRipple also secured a Major Payments Institution license from the MAS this week. However, the good news gains were reversed by the weekend. XRP fell 1.6% over the last seven days to hit $0.5224 by the weekend.\n\nOnly two cryptocurrencies posted any notable price movements, rallying around 15% this week: Avalanche (AVAX), which currently trades for $10.39, and Solana (SOL), which is currently worth $23.31.\n\nOn Monday, the Solana network's total value locked (TVL) hit a new 2023 high of $338.82 million.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the news\u2026\n\nThe week began with Coinbase secured a Major Payment Institution (MPI) license from MAS. This development follows the In-Principle Approval (IPA) Coinbase received last year, part of a drive by the exchange to expand globally due to the uncertain regulatory climate on the company\u2019s U.S. home turf.\n\nOn Tuesday, Helen Boyd, Head of Capital Markets at the independent regulatory watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), announced that the British Treasury hopes to launch a Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS) by the end of the first quarter of next year.\n\nA sandbox is a controlled test environment for those looking to bring innovative products to the market. The FCA already has a similar engagement via its Regulatory Sandbox where companies with viable products can begin pitching them to a closed circle of early customers, but the DSS has \u201ca new rule set that would allow it to do new things with digital securities.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Hong Kong\u2019s police force and Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) launched a joint task force to monitor illegal activities on crypto exchanges following the suspension of trading on the JPEX exchange. The JPEX incident is one of the largest cases of financial fraud in Hong Kong history. involving at least 2,305 victims of the incident, who collectively have been defrauded of HK$1.43 billion ($182.9 million).\n\nA report published this week by blockchain data platform Chainalysis shows that recent inflows to Hong Kong have rivaled that of mainland China over the past year, despite hosting only 0.5% of the latter\u2019s population.\n\nFinally this week, both Starbucks and the Museum of Modern Art launched NFTs."

        "content": "The price of Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), has gained around 35% in 2023 so far. But its attempts to break above $2,000, a psychological resistance level, have witnessed strong bearish rejections multiple times.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nCointelegraph takes a closer look at the three likely reasons why Ethereum price has failed to decisively retake $2,000 since May 2022.\n\nEthereum price paints bear cycle fractal\n\nEthereum\u2019s inability to cross above $2,000 in 2023 resembles the bearish rejection near $425 from 2018 to 2019.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIn both cases, Ether appears to be in a recovery phase while eying close above its 0.236 Fib line of the Fibonacci retracement graph.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2019, the 0.236 Fib line was near $425 and was instrumental in limiting Ether\u2019s recovery attempts. In 2023, the same line is near $2,000, enforcing itself again as a selling area and, thus, pressuring ETH\u2019s price lower.\n\nStronger U.S. dollar, Bitcoin\n\nA strengthening United States dollar has dampened demand for Ethereum in recent months, thus reducing its ability to close decisively above $2,000.\n\nThe prevailing negative correlation between top cryptocurrencies and the dollar has been the main culprit. In 2023, in particular, the weekly correlation coefficient between Ether and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has been consistently negative, as shown below.\n\nETH/USD and DXY weekly correlation coefficient chart. Source: TradingView\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum has largely underperformed Bitcoin in 2023 due to the ongoing spot Bitcoin ETF hype. For instance, the widely-tracked ETH/BTC pair is down 20% year-to-date.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAdditionally, the net capital held by Ethereum-tied investment funds has dropped by $114 million so far in 2023, according to CoinShares\u2019 weekly report. In comparison, Bitcoin-based funds have attracted $168 million in the same period.\n\nRelated: Time to \u2018pull the brakes\u2019 on Ethereum and rotate back to Bitcoin: K33 report\n\nEthereum network activity dips\n\nThe total value locked (TVL) across the Ethereum ecosystem has dropped from 18.41 million ETH to 12.79 million ETH so far in 2023. That underscores a reduced availability of funds, resulting in lower yields for investors, as JP Morgan analysts also warned recently.\n\nEthereum TVL since 2019. Source: Defi Llama\n\nThe declining TVL has accompanied a drop in the Ethereum network\u2019s gas fees, which reached a yearly low on Oct. 5.\n\n#Ethereum's network has been particularly cheap to use, and this week's average fee level of $1.13 is the lowest since November, 2022. Though not a perfect signal by any means, lower $ETH costs generally lead to a rise in utility and price rebound. https://t.co/ymXFwGJh49 pic.twitter.com/PEGpXMmZ3q \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 4, 2023\n\nEthereum\u2019s NFT volumes and unique active wallets have also dropped by 30% and 16.5% in the last 30 days, according to DappRadar.\n\nThat includes declines in the key metrics of popular apps, including decentralized exchange Uniswap v2, DEX aggregator 1inch Network, Ethereum staking provider Lido and others.\n\nEthereum technical analysis\n\nEthereum price technicals meanwhile show a potential rebound toward its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) near $1,665.\n\nHowever, looking broadly, ETH/USD has been paining a bearish continuation pattern called an ascending triangle.\n\nAs a result, a break below the triangle\u2019s lower trendline risks crashing the price by as much as the pattern\u2019s maximum height. In this case, ETH\u2019s price can drop to $1,465 and $1,560 in October 2023, depending on the breakdown point.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIn the short term, a break above the 50-day EMA could have ETH\u2019s price rise toward the triangle\u2019s upper trendline near $1,730 in October 2023, coinciding with the 200-day EMA (the blue wave).\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
