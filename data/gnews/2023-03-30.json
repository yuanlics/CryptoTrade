        "content": "In episode 13 of Cointelegraph\u2019s Hashing It Out podcast, Elisha Owusu Akyaw sits down with Metis co-founder Elena Sinelnikova. Metis is an Optimistic Rollup built on Ethereum to explore the world of layer-2 blockchain technology, and its potential impact on decentralization, scalability and real-world applications. Sinelnikova shares her unique insights and experiences in the rapidly evolving blockchain space, and gives us a glimpse into the future of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) powered by Metis.\n\nThe conversation begins with Sinelnikova providing a comprehensive introduction to Metis, its mission and the challenges it aims to address in the current blockchain landscape. Next, she dives deep into the limitations of Ethereum\u2019s layer 1, highlighting issues such as high gas fees, congestion and slow transaction times. Sinelnikova explains how Metis leverages layer 2 technology to overcome these hurdles \u2014 enabling faster, more efficient, and cost-effective transactions for users and developers.\n\nMetis is built on top of the Optimism codebase. Sinelnikova explains that even though the Metis team believes Optimism is on the right path, the team needed to make some changes to the code to create a more efficient platform for the Web3 economy.\n\n\u201cYou see, Metis fees are way lower than Optimism fees. We needed these lower fees for the enterprise level \u2014 so the enterprise level apps can use Metis easier more than Optimism.\u201c\n\nNext, Akyaw and Sinelnikova discuss the importance of decentralization in the blockchain ecosystem. Metis intends to use its unique approach to building and supporting decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to shape the future of work and collaboration. What\u2019s more, Sinelnikova emphasizes the role of Metis in empowering individuals and businesses to create, manage, and scale their DAOs, thereby fostering a more inclusive and transparent decentralized economy.\n\nRelated: Africa: The next hub for Bitcoin, crypto adoption and venture capital?\n\nThis episode also explores the topic of adoption and education. Sinelnikova believes that the most important thing is not getting new users into crypto but protecting users who have already ventured into crypto through extensive education.\n\nFinally, Sinelnikova discusses the future of Metis and layer 2 blockchain technology, outlining the vision for the platform\u2019s ongoing development and growth.\n\nListen to the latest episode of Hashing It Out with Elena Sinelnikova on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, or TuneIn.

        "title": "Analysts debate the ETH price outcomes of Ethereum's upcoming Shapella upgrade - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation has announced April 12 as the date of deployment of the much-anticipated Shanghai and Capella upgrade, together dubbed as Shapella.\n\nThe upgrades will enable withdrawals from Ethereum 2.0 staking contracts. The staking contract was first launched in December 2020. It only accepted one-way deposits of Ether(ETH), which will change after the upgrade.\n\nTo date, users have deposited over 18 million ETH, worth around $32.5 billion, into the Ethereum staking contract since December 2020.\n\nAnalysts vary on the estimates of ETH sell pressure\n\nMost users opted for liquid staking derivatives (LSD) on decentralized or centralized exchanges. Because these stakers are already liquid, there will likely be no new reason to sell after the Shapella upgrade.\n\nDecentralized LSD platforms like Lido currently account for around 33.2% of the total ETH deposits on the Beacon Chain. Out of the rest, around 27.1% is deposited via centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Binance and Kraken. Thus, 60.3% of the staked ETH is deposited via liquid staking mediums.\n\nOn the other hand, the illiquid ETH, which is deposited into the contracts directly by setting up nodes or third-party service providers, accounts for around 40% of the total amount. These are most likely to sell after unlocking.\n\nAccording to analysis from Nansen, around 59% of the illiquid deposits, between 3.62 million and 4 million ETH, are in profit. These users are most likely to go through partial or complete withdrawals after the withdrawals are enabled.\n\nSome of the illiquid stakers might also choose to re-stake and the Nansen report estimated total selling pressure to be somewhere between 1.2 million and 3 million ETH. However, all ETH will not be dumped into the market right away.\n\nViews on daily selling pressure\n\nThe Shapella upgrade will implement a two-tier partial and full withdrawal system.\n\nThe minimum amount to stake on ETH is 32 ETH. Stakers can withdraw amounts exceeding 32 ETH or completely withdraw the entire 32 ETH, plus additional rewards from the staking contract.\n\nThere will not be a situation where stakers rush to withdraw their ETH after the upgrade leading to a spike in gas prices. Ether withdrawals have no gas costs but will be limited to 16 partial or complete withdrawals per block. Thus, there will be a delay in the amount of ETH unlocked and moved to sell.\n\nAccording to the Nansen report, there will be three phases of ETH selling pressure after the upgrade.\n\nIn the first phase, lasting 27 hours after the update, the selling pressure from partial withdrawals will be around 84,000 to 125,000 Ether per day (around $133 million to $197 million).\n\nThe second phase will see maximum selling pressure from partial and full withdrawals, amounting to 136,000 and 173,000 Ether per day (about $218 million to $275 million) in additional selling pressure. This phase will last between the third and fourth day after the upgrade.\n\nThe last phase of selling pressure, with mainly full withdrawals, will last between 19 to 52 days, adding a daily selling pressure of between 48,000 and 53,000 Ether per day.\n\nEstimated selling pressure after Shapella upgrade. Source: Nansen\n\nThe 30-day moving average of exchange inflows is 313,533 ETH (worth around $550 million), which means the additional inflows will be between 15% to 55% of the moving average. This could suppress Ether prices until the selling pressure subsides in three to eight weeks.\n\nAnother estimate by Arcana Research found that around 1.3 million ETH will be sold in the first ten days due to partial and full withdrawals. The selling pressure will peak in the first three days with around $527 million (adjusted for Ether\u2019s current price of $1,800) daily selling pressure. It accounts for around 6.4% of the ETH daily trading volume.\n\nWith less than a fortnight to the upgrade, traders may attempt to front-run the selling pressure by placing short orders in the futures market. So far, the futures market shows no significant uptick in open interest volume or funding rates for short orders.\n\nRelated: Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade could supercharge liquid staking derivatives \u2014 Here\u2019s how\n\nThe beginning of ETH withdrawals will reduce the risk of holding liquid staking derivatives bought via decentralized or centralized exchanges because they will become directly redeemable for ETH. Thus, newfound staking interest among investors sitting on the sidelines would somewhat counter the selling pressure.\n\nThe Ethereum staking ratio, i.e., the percentage of staked ETH relative to its total circulating supply, is 14.96%. This is significantly less than the industry average across other Layer-1 blockchains. The ETH staking ratio is also expected to improve in the long run.\n\nTechnically, the ETH/USD pair faces resistance from the $1,970 level. Breakout above this resistance can see the pair reach bullish targets around $2,330 and $2,750. In case of a downturn, support lies around $1,569.\n\nETH/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum network will undergo one of the most extensive upgrades since the Merge in September 2022. ETH withdrawals after the Shapella upgrade are likely to see increased selling in the first few days after deployment, putting short-term pressure on prices. However, as the selling subsides and more users move to stake ETH due to reduced risk and increased yields, the market conditions could start favoring more upside in the long term.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
