        "summary": "  Ethereum's Beacon Chain was updated after experiencing finality issues on May 11 and 12, causing delays in block finalization. The issues were resolved through patches rolled out by core developers for Prysm and Teku clients. The Beacon Chain serves as the consensus layer for the Ethereum network and is designed to be resilient against such issues. Client diversity played a crucial role in ensuring live and end users could transact on the network during the issue. Teku and Prysm have released optimizations to prevent beacon nodes from consuming excessive resources. The update comes after a similar issue delayed the Goerli testnet version of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade in March. Recent trading hype around memecoins has increased Ethereum\u2019s activity and staking rewards rates."

        "summary": "  Ethereum is expected to experience a 35% surge in staking demand in 2023, according to a report by Staked, a research subsidiary of the Kraken exchange.
