        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst and trader believes Ethereum (ETH) could rally to levels last witnessed about a year ago.\n\nPseudonymous crypto analyst Kaleo tells his 586,700 Twitter followers that Ethereum could surge to $2,400, a level last reached in May of 2022 before the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem collapsed.\n\nHowever, Kaleo also says that Ethereum could first dip to $1,600 before rallying by around 50% to his target price.\n\n\u201cThis is still my best-case scenario play for ETH.\n\nDip to $1,600s, then run it back up to approximately $2,400 to retest the pre-LUNA/UST liquidation breakdown level.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, fellow crypto strategist Bluntz holds a similar outlook on ETH.\n\nAccording to Bluntz, the second-largest crypto asset by market cap could find support at around the $1,600 area before potentially ending its current corrective move.\n\n\u201cETH is getting absolutely mauled right now.\n\nNot too sure where I would be looking for longs, probably somewhere between $1,600 \u2013 $1,700 and even then I would want to see a very significant reversal candle.\u201d\n\nThe analysts\u2019 view on Ethereum comes as a prominent analytics firm reveals that ETH\u2019s supply on crypto exchanges is falling.\n\nAccording to Santiment, the percentage of Ethereum on crypto exchanges has plunged to an eight-year low.\n\n\u201cAs Ethereum has dipped to $1,780 today, we\u2019ve seen exchange supply continue to decrease. The percentage of ETH on exchanges is at its lowest (10.1%) since public trading began in 2015. This is essentially the all-time high for non-exchange holdings.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,811 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum core developers rolled out patches for Prysm Labs and Teku clients in response to two Beacon Chain finality issues in 24 hours. The Beacon Chain serves as the consensus layer for the Ethereum network.\n\nOn May 11, Ethereum developers reported that the Beacon Chain was experiencing problems confirming transactions. Although new blocks could be proposed, an unknown issue prevented their finalization. The outage lasted around 25 minutes. A similar issue occurred on May 12, preventing block finalization for over an hour.\n\nFinality was unable to be reached for three and eight epochs, said the Ethereum Foundation in a statement shared by an Ethereum consultant on Twitter. The issue \u201cappears to have been caused by high load on some of the Consensus Layers clients, which in turn was caused by an exceptional scenario.\u201d\n\nThe beacon chain stopped finalizing about thirty minutes ago. I don't know why yet, but in general the chain is designed to be resilient against this, transactions will continue as usual and finalization will kick in when the problem is resolved. pic.twitter.com/utAS0uAWpG \u2014 superphiz.eth \ufe0f (@superphiz) May 11, 2023\n\nAlthough the network was unable to finalize, live and end users were able to transact on the network thanks to client diversity, \u201cas not all client implementations were affected by this exceptional scenario.\u201d\n\nClient diversity relates to the number of software clients available to network validators. Greater diversity among clients means a more robust and secure network.\n\nTeky and Prysm have released upgrades that implement optimizations to prevent beacon nodes from consuming excessive resources.\n\nA similar issue occurred on March 15, delaying the Goerli testnet version of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade, which was successfully deployed on April 12. Ethereum\u2019s preexisting proof-of-work chain merged with the Beacon Chain on Sept. 15, 2022, enabling the network\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is faster and less energy-intensive.\n\nRecent trading hype around memecoins has increased Ethereum\u2019s activity and staking rewards rates. According to on-chain data, validators earned $46 million in the first week of May, or 24,997 Ether (ETH), a 40% increase over the previous week\u2019s income of $33 million, when 18,339 ETH were distributed as rewards.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDecrypting DeFi is Decrypt's DeFi email newsletter. (art: Grant Kempster)\n\nCrypto Twitter has been awash the past few weeks with talk of a strange new protocol called EigenLayer.\n\nSome are going as far as calling it the next Ethereum Meta, while others are already whipping up speculative airdrop guides. And at least one person is doing God\u2019s work, helping us all pronounce the project\u2019s name.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, what in the hell is EigenLayer? Well, think of it as being like blockchain security-as-a-service.\n\nInstead of having to gather funds, hardware, and a series of validators to keep your newly-launched crypto project from getting 51% attacked (or worse), EigenLayer wants to put staked Ethereum back to work for you.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works.\n\nEthereum\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism means that the network is secured by economic incentives and penalties rather than massive warehouses of mining machines. So-called validators in such a network can join and begin earning ETH-denominated yield once they stake 32 ETH to the network. If, however, their validators go down or they behave maliciously by validating incorrect transactions, they\u2019ll be penalized; a portion of that 32 Ethereum gets taken away.\n\nFor reference, there\u2019s currently 19.7 million Ethereum enlisted to keep Ethereum secure, or about $34 billion today\u2014that\u2019s more than 16% of all Ethereum currently in circulation. Yes, it\u2019s a lot.\n\nEigenLayer takes this a step further by rehypothecating all that staked ETH to serve the same security purposes but for other, newer projects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRehypothecation is basically another term for using the same money twice. And because that money\u2019s being used twice, stakers who opt-in will also enjoy an even higher yield. And the more projects that build (and gain traction), the more yield opted-in stakers can earn.\n\nGiven that the asset being staked here is also Ethereum, these other projects would also be Ethereum-based. EigenLayer\u2019s white paper includes bridge technologies and oracle providers that could all use this double-dipped Ethereum.\n\nIn many ways, this will also make the developers\u2019 deployment experience far easier, providing confidence that their pet project will ultimately be backed by the market\u2019s second-largest crypto network.\n\nIt\u2019s an odd, very crypto-native idea, but as mentioned, it\u2019s got a lot of folks fired up. ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin said EigenLayer is \u201cat the forefront of some of the most exciting work happening in Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAnd in March, the project raised $50 million in a Series A round from a host of notable investors.\n\nIt\u2019s early days, of course. For now, though, all eyes are on Eigen.\n\nDecrypting DeFi is our DeFi newsletter, led by this essay. Subscribers to our emails get to read the essay before it goes on the site. Subscribe here."
