This is according to Arkham Intelligence, which previously identified Robinhood as the owner of the third-largest Bitcoin address. The address holds 1.5 million ETH and more than 100 ERC-20 tokens, worth a total of $2.71 billion. Robinhood's trading model requires the company to back user balances at a 1:1 ratio in line with SEC regulations, which means that the funds in the wallet are likely held in custody for Robinhood users. The largest Ethereum address belongs to Ethereum's beacon deposit contract, which holds over 29 million ETH, or one-quarter of the entire Ethereum supply. Robinhood also holds funds on other blockchains, including Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, and BNB Chain, with a total of $7.39 billion in crypto assets as of Aug. 30."

Gunter explains that MEV refers to the value that participants in the system can extract by ordering transactions in a way that favors them, rather than in an orderly and fair manner. She notes that naive users may assume that transactions enter a waiting room and are picked up in an orderly manner, but in reality, certain network participants can insert transactions between sets to capture arbitrage or frontrun transactions at unfavorable prices. Gunter acknowledges that there are no perfect solutions to mitigating MEV, but highlights the importance of transparency in addressing these issues. She notes that the open source nature of Ethereum development contrasts with the \"Wall Street Flash Boys dynamic,\" where no one knew that specialized firms were secretly frontrunning the stock market for years. Gunter is grateful for the research and discovery of these issues in an open manner, but acknowledges the double-edged sword of transparency in blockchain, where problems are more visible but"
