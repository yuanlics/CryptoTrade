        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThough the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is waging legal war across the crypto space, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin isn\u2019t breaking a sweat.\n\nWhen asked about regulators potentially treating Ether (ETH) like a security, the Consensys CEO explained during a Tuesday interview with CNBC that the regulatory verdict on Ethereum is already in.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has spoken,\u201d he said, referring to former SEC commissioner Bill Hinman\u2019s 2018 speech on crypto securities and Ethereum.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNew documents have revealed that Hinman received multiple warnings from colleagues that the speech could confuse markets into thinking that the SEC had already deemed the asset a non-security.\n\n\n\nA security is a financial instrument often (but not always) associated with some kind of investment contract. A commodity, by contrast, is a basic or natural good, like gold, wheat, or cattle.\n\n\u201cThe CFTC has spoken very crisply a number of times that they consider Ether like a commodity,\u201d added Lubin.\n\nWhile Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Benham agrees that many cryptocurrencies are securities, he also thinks the three top assets\u2014including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, and Tether (USDT)\u2014belong under his agency\u2019s jurisdiction as commodities.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler, by contrast, has only publicly deemed Bitcoin as such.\n\n\n\nOn the topic of Ether, Gensler has kept a tight lip. Some videos from his time as an MIT professor suggest he once thought it was a security, while others indicate he believed it had graduated from a security into a commodity by 2018.\n\nMembers of Congress are drafting legislation to clear up this issue, including Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, and have voiced agreement with the CFTC that Ether is a commodity alongside Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a forgone conclusion at this point,\u201d said Lubin. \u201cThere may be a regulator or two in the United States that can\u2019t bring himself to utter the fact that Ether is not a security, but I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe SEC sued Binance and Coinbase earlier this month alleging that over a dozen assets listed on their platform were securities, including Paxos-issued stablecoin BUSD.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Indicators Signal Extended Correction To $1,790 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price is slowly moving lower from the $1,920 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could extend its decline toward the $1,790 support.\n\nEthereum is still struggling to surpass the $1,920 resistance.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,885 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could decline further toward the $1,790 support in the coming sessions.\n\nEthereum Price Stuck In A Range\n\nEthereum\u2019s price attempted another upside break above the key $1,920 resistance zone. ETH failed to gain bullish momentum for a close above the $1,920 level, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nA high is formed near $1,912 and the price is now moving lower. There was a break below the $1,900 level. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,838 low to the $1,912 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,885 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is now trading below $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is now testing the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,838 low to the $1,912 high.\n\nIf Ethereum stays above $1,850, it could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is near the $1,880 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major resistance is near the $1,900 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe main barrier is still near the $1,920 and $1,930 levels. A close above the $1,930 zone could start a steady increase and send the price further higher. The next resistance sits near $2,000, above which the price could rise toward the $2,050 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,120 resistance.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,850 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,840 level. If there is a move below $1,840, the price could accelerate lower toward $1,790. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,750 support.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,840\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,900\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum price won't see $2K anytime soon, market data suggests - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Ether (ETH) faced strong resistance at $1,920 after a 17.5% rally between June 15 and June 22. Several factors contributed to the limited upside, including worsening macroeconomic conditions, the regulatory cryptocurrency environment and weaker demand for decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network.\n\nETH price faces macroeconomic headwinds\n\nOn June 26, a federal judge denied a motion from Binance that could have stopped the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from issuing public statements related to the case.\n\nIn addition, in its mid-year outlook, HSBC Asset Management\u2019s report warned of an economic downturn in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, followed by a \u201cyear of contraction and a European recession in 2024\u201d. The report also noted that \u201ccorporate defaults have started to creep up.\u201d\n\nFinally, International Monetary Fund chief economist Gita Gopinath told CNBC on June 27 that central bankers should \u201ccontinue tightening\u201d by keeping interest rates high for longer than expected.\n\nEthereum network demand, gas fees drop\n\nUsage of DApps on the Ethereum network failed to gain momentum as gas fees dropped 60%. Notably, the seven-day average transaction cost dropped to $3.7 on June 26, down from $9 four weeks prior.\n\nDApp active addresses also declined by 27% in the same period.\n\n30-day Ethereum DApp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nA large chunk of the decline was concentrated on Uniswap and MetaMask Swap, while most nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces saw a surge in their unique active wallets (UAW).\n\nDespite Uniswap NFT Aggregator\u2019s lackluster performance, the sector faced a decent influx of users on OpenSea, Blur, Manifold, LooksRare and Unick.\n\nMore concerningly, however, is that the total value locked (TVL) \u2014 measuring the deposits locked in Ethereum smart contracts \u2014 reached its lowest level since August 2020. The indicator declined by 6.9% between April 28 and June 28 to 13.9 million ETH, according to DefiLlama.\n\nETH price rally not supported by derivatives markets\n\nSo how are professional traders positioned for the next ETH price move? Let\u2019s look at Ether futures to gauge the odds of ETH/USD breaking above the $1,920 resistance.\n\nETH quarterly futures are the preferred instruments of whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts usually trade at a slight premium to spot markets, as they demand an additional fee to postpone settlement.\n\nAs a result, in healthy markets, ETH futures contracts should trade at a 5\u201310% annualized premium, a situation known as contango.\n\nEther two-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to the futures premium \u2014 known as the basis indicator \u2014 professional traders have been avoiding leveraged longs (bullish bets). Despite the modest improvement to 3%, the metric remains far from the neutral 5% threshold.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted the Ether futures, one should analyze the ETH options markets. The 25% delta skew indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options, and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put option premium is higher than the call options.\n\nEther 30-day 25% skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe skew indicator will move above 8% if traders fear an Ether price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 8% skew.\n\nAs displayed above, the delta skew has been flirting with moderate optimism since June 22 but has been unable to sustain it for long. Presently, the negative 2% metric displays a balanced demand for options.\n\nResistance below $2,000 remains formidable\n\nJudging by the ETH derivatives metrics, and declining TVL and DApps use, bears are better positioned to defend the $1,920 resistance. Moreover, the worsening macroeconomic conditions and cryptocurrency regulatory news confirm the moderate pessimism for risk-on assets, including Ether.\n\nRelated: 3 reasons why Ethereum\u2019s market cap dominance is on the rise\n\nThat does not necessarily mean that Ether is bound to retest $1,750, but it certainly presents an enormous hurdle for ETH bulls after failing to break the $1,920 level on three occasions between June 21 and June 25.\n\nConsequently, at least for the short term, bears have better odds of successfully defending this important price level.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
