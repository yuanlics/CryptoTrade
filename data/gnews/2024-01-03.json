The decline is attributed to a number of macro forces, including a strengthening US dollar, a decline in long bonds and corresponding surge in yields, and a rotation to more defensive assets. Additionally, the article suggests that the recent rise in these cryptocurrencies was driven by expectations of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, which may now be in doubt. The total value locked (TVL) in the crypto sector has also declined by 5.8% since the beginning of the year, with Ethereum, Solana, and XRP seeing similar declines in their TVL values.

It was proposed by Fabian Vogelsteller in 2015 and has since become the most prominent standard for creating tokens on Ethereum. The standard specifies six required and three optional functions that developers must include in their smart contract code in order to generate an ERC-20 token. These functions include total supply, balance of, transfer, approve, transfer from, and allowance. Additionally, developers can add additional functions and features to ERC-20 token contracts.\n\nERC-20 tokens are fungible, meaning they can be exchanged for other tokens of the same type and value. They can represent any type of asset, including utility tokens, security tokens, and stablecoins. The standard ensures that ERC-20 tokens can interact with smart contracts effectively, which is crucial for their use in decentralized applications.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard is not a piece of software or a program, but rather a protocol that governs the creation of new tokens. It ensures that tokens conform to the necessary technical requirements and cannot be issued"
