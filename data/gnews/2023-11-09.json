        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) is a decentralized, open-source technology that powers much of the crypto world. It's the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC) and has a growing use in various industries such as finance, logistics, and healthcare. The Ethereum Merge, a shift to a proof-of-stake system, is expected to make the technology remarkably more energy-efficient. Investors can buy Ethereum directly through a crypto exchange, stock broker, or payment app that carries it. Alternatively, they can invest in managed funds that invest in Ethereum for them or companies with large exposure to Ethereum technology. The best stocks to buy for Ethereum exposure include Grayscale Ethereum Trust, Bitwise Ethereum Fund, HIVE Blockchain, NVIDIA, and AMD. Investing in crypto assets themselves or companies betting on blockchain and crypto asset uptake is the best way to get exposure to the movement."

This is a significant change from the token's recent inflationary spiral.

NFT trading volume has also hit a three-month high, but analysts believe that this is not the sole reason for the deflation. Altcoins have been the main driver of the deflation, with numerous ETH-based tokens enjoying substantial rallies in the past week.
