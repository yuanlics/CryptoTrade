        "title": "Ethereum stablecoin dominance reaches 3-month high - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Glassnode data analyzed by CryptoSlate indicates that Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) dominance over stablecoins has been increasing and reached its highest in the last three months.\n\nEthereum\u2019s dominance over stablecoins strengthens as the ETH price surpasses $1,600.\n\nThe analysis includes the top four stablecoins: Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Binance USD (BUSD), and DAI (DAI).\n\nThe chart below represents a comparison of the ETH market cap to the aggregate value of these stablecoins since the beginning of 2020. The green line reflects the combined value of the stablecoins, while the black one shows the ETH market cap.\n\nETH held an unquestionable dominance over stablecoins between the beginning of 2020 and mid-2022. In the summer of 2022, stablecoins\u2019 aggregate value surpassed ETHs, marking a first in the history of ETH.\n\nEven though ETH recovered its dominance by the end of July 2022, stablecoins triumphed over ETH dominance once more for a short while in November 2022. Current data shows that ETH\u2019s dominance over stablecoins has been strengthened since then.\n\nExchanges\u2019 stablecoin reserves have been shrinking since the FTX collapse. A recent CryptoSlate analysis revealed that a total of 3.93 billion stablecoins had left the exchanges since the FTX crash.\n\nIn the meantime, the ETH price has been on an upwards trajectory. ETH is being traded for around $1,623 at the time of writing, reflecting a 33.23% increase in the last 30 days.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Ethereum and Cardano have always been at loggerheads. The two blockchain network\u2019s development activity has been pitted against each other even before the former\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Needless to say, Ethereum and Cardano went on to become the blockchains with the most active developers in 2022, with 223 and 151 average daily devs throughout the year.\n\nAccording to the latest report by DappRadar, Ethereum saw the smallest decrease of 9.37% in active developers and managed to retain its dominance. Cardano\u2019s developer count declined by 26.47% from the previous year.\n\nDeveloper activity indicates the blockchain\u2019s health and growth. As explained by DappRadar, the metric gives an insight into the level of interest and engagement by devs, which is crucial \u201cfor the development of new features, increased security, network effects, innovation, and thus, adoption.\u201d\n\nApart from the established players, three modular blockchains, namely Polkadot, Kusama, and Cosmos, completed the top 5.\n\nThe developer activity in Polkadot and Kusama increased by 16,06% and 12,80%, respectively, attracting 129 daily active devs on average. Cosmos, on the other hand, recorded 117 average daily developers.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana and Internet Computer (ICP) saw the most significant increase in active devs in 2022. Since the previous year, the two blockchain networks surged by 1,320% and 1,050%, respectively.\n\nThe report also stated that Solana looks promising despite being the most impacted in the FTX-induced drawdown.\n\nThe average number of daily active developers on the blockchain noted a decline of 31.4% over the past 30 days and continued to attract an average of 69 daily active developers."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe jokes wrote themselves.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice declared ominously that it would hold a live press conference at noon to announce an \"International Cryptocurrency Enforcement Action.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCrypto Twitter panicked, and so did crypto prices. Bitcoin and Ethereum each fell nearly 5% in just a few minutes, amounting to a flash crash. Which big player was caught in the DOJ's crosshairs? Binance was a popular bet, and CZ didn't help matters by tweeting just \"4,\" which he announced on January 2 is his new signal for incoming \"FUD, fake news, attacks, etc.\"\n\nThen the press conference happened. It wasn't Binance. It wasn't Celsius, or Voyager, or Blockfi, or any other bankrupt crypto lender that screwed over its customers. It was a Hong Kong-based, Russian-owned crypto exchange called Bitzlato.\n\nBitz-what? Bitzlatte? I've been writing about crypto since 2011, and never heard of it.\n\nBitzlato has like 1,400 followers and hasn't tweeted in almost a year pic.twitter.com/VMNqVMSo5x \u2014 Jacquelyn Melinek (@jacqmelinek) January 18, 2023\n\nBitzlato, the DOJ said, processed more than $700 million in illicit funds, including millions in proceeds from ransomware.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOkay. But as of January 18, Bitzlato customer wallets had... $11,000 in them, according to a Coinbase operations director. At Bitzlato's peak, customer wallets held $6 million\u2014a trifle. And yet DOJ Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco touted the enforcement action as \"a significant blow to the cryptocrime ecosystem.\" She said Bitzlato, \"fueled a high-tech axis of cryptocrime.\"\n\nThe crypto market quickly rebounded.\n\nI could embed a bunch more of the best memes on this, but let's move on to the Why, and the What This Means.\n\nThe DOJ is attempting to flex.\n\nPeople in crypto laughed at it, but those outside crypto probably didn't. The U.S. government wants to make crystal clear\u2014especially after the massively scrutinized collapse of FTX\u2014that it is aware of CRYPTO CRIME (!) and is taking decisive action.\n\nThe DOJ has reportedly been investigating Binance since 2018, and according to Reuters is split over whether to bring charges. It's been rumored that the DOJ is also investigating Digital Currency Group, owner of crypto lender Genesis, which filed for bankruptcy this week.\n\nAnd the DOJ isn't alone: the SEC charged both Genesis and Gemini at once last week for violating securities laws.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in an interview on our gm podcast last month, was reluctant to say outright that the FTX meltdown will lead directly to more crypto regulation. But it's clear that at the very least it has already led to more posturing. And Peirce did say she hopes it won't lead her peers to overreact with hasty restrictions.\n\n\u201cI think we should all be on the lookout for regulatory frameworks that are developed in the context of enforcement action, because it\u2019s a very tempting thing for regulators to do that,\u201d Peirce said. \u201cAnd it just cuts everybody else out of the process.\u201d\n\nI frequently say that people in crypto have an irrational fear of the very word \"regulation.\" They presume regulating crypto means shutting it down entirely, when regulation could simply mean\u2014in an ideal scenario for all\u2014creating new safeguards for retail investors.\n\nThat said, what Sam Bankman-Fried hath wrought is a new climate in which regulators and politicians are feeling more pressured than ever before to show they're serious about ridding crypto of the bad actors. And that could lead to overreach. We already saw it last year with Tornado Cash.\n\nThe next big hyped enforcement action may not be against some small-time player."
