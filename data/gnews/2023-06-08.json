Demeester claims that Ethereum developers lied about scaling from the beginning and instead focused on pumping the price of Ether through an on-chain scaling narrative. He suggests that all announcements about Ethereum scaling concepts outside of L2 solutions were made to \"pump and dump\" the price of Ether. Demeester notes that Bitcoiners have spent years building real second-layer solutions, while Ethereum developers have stealthily pivoted to a different approach. The Cancun-Deneb upgrade, which is designed to supercharge Ethereum by proto-danksharding, has been approved by Ethereum core developers. However, some of Demeester's followers have questioned the traction of Lightning Network, the most popular Bitcoin L2 scaling solution on payment channels."

The bug left over $2.2 billion in crypto locked inside dapps, including GMX and Uniswap. Despite the incident, the Arbitrum team described the system as \"working as intended,\" as the sequencer is only provided ETH if it can successfully post batches. The network was back processing transactions on Ethereum mainnet as normal by 10:00 am ET. This incident highlights the tradeoffs of using rollups, which offer higher performance and lower transaction costs but also involve additional risks, such as centralized control and potential censorship resistance failures."
