We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe quest for dominance between Ethereum (ETH) and its most obvious rival, Cardano (ADA), is taking a whole new shape, with new metrics defining how well each protocol is faring. A sneak peek into both protocols' decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, per data gleaned from DeFiLlama, especially as it relates to the Total Value Locked (TVL) metric, shows that Cardano has a clear lead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer the DeFiLlama data, there is a significant plunge in the total ETH tokens locked within its smart contract; however, the reverse is the case as concerns ADA. For a better perspective, while the total ETH locked in its DeFi protocol as far back as January was pegged at 18.28 million units, the current figure has now plummeted back to 13.33 million units at the time of writing.\n\nCardano, on the other hand, saw the total TVL in its DeFi smart contracts pegged at 198.65 million ADA tokens as of Jan. 1, and today, this ADA lockup has grown to 571.92 million, an indication of consistent growth and embrace of new applications making their way onto the Cardano blockchain.\n\nMore upsides for Cardano\n\nWhile the individual token lockup in DeFi smart contracts is in favor of Cardano, the protocol still lags behind in other significant areas. These areas include the exact market capitalization of Ethereum when compared to that of Cardano. This wide disparity in token market capitalization also compliments the overall dollar value of TVL on both protocols.\n\nHowever, amid all these, Cardano has a significant upside that investors can watch out for. The effort to consistently upgrade the Cardano network remains a very promising push that can attract more Web3.0 developers who can build dApps to rival those on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIt may take some time, but overall, Cardano has the chance to become as big, or even bigger, than Ethereum."

        "content": "Ethereum price is struggling to clear the $1,900 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could gain bearish momentum if there is a close below $1,850.\n\nEthereum is showing bearish signs below the $1,920 level.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could decline steadily if the price remains below $1,900.\n\nEthereum Price Remains At Risk\n\nEthereum\u2019s price made another attempt to settle above the $1,900 level. However, ETH failed to gain bullish momentum above the $1,900 resistance and started a fresh decline, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThe price declined below the $1,885 and $1,875 levels. The bulls are now active above the $1,860 level. A low is formed near $1,863 and the price is now consolidating losses. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is trading below $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $1,885 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level recent drop from the $1,903 swing high to the $1,863 low.\n\nThe first major resistance is near the $1,890 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level recent drop from the $1,903 swing high to the $1,863 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next major resistance is near the $1,900 level and the trend line, above which the price could test the main resistance at $1,920. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,000 resistance in the near term.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,865 level.\n\nThe first major support is near the $1,850 level, below which the price might gain bearish momentum. The next major support is near the $1,825 support level. A close below $1,825 could spark sharp bearish moves toward the $1,720 level. Any more losses could open the doors for a move toward the $1,650 support level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,850\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,900\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Skeptical of Worldcoin's Privacy with Iris Scans - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nDecentralized ID platform Worldcoin releases its native token.\n\nProtocol provides digital passports tied to a physical iris scan.\n\nWeb3 divided over pros and cons.\n\nDecentralized identity platform Worldcoin launched its ecosystem token, grabbing headlines as opinions remain divided about the potential positives and negatives of the blockchain-based digital passport project.\n\nMajor cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance and Crypto.com announced support for the WLD token upon its launch. The token is tied to the Worldcoin ecosystem, which users receive upon creation of a privacy-preserving digital identity (World ID).\n\nIn order to create a World ID, users have to have their biometric data captured. This is taken in the form of an iris scan carried out by Worldcoin\u2019s proprietary, high-tech optic Orb hardware.\n\nThe long term vision of the project would see Orb\u2019s being built and distributed around the world, allowing users to create their own World ID\u2019s which can be used for a myriad of use cases.\n\nWorld ID\u2019s act as a \u201cproof of personhood\u201d that make use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) to protect the underlying data, including biometric, KYC and AML data. WorldCoin will also enable users to \u201creserve\u201d their respective IDs with a phone number in select countries, with an iris scan required to complete the process and receive a World ID.\n\nThe concept of proof of personhood is not new to the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin addressed at length in a thought-provoking essay centered around the use case.\n\nWhat do I think about biometric proof of personhood?https://t.co/yozo1buW24 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 24, 2023\n\nUnpacking Worldcoin\n\nButerin delves into the technicalities of proof of personhood blockchain protocols and the potential benefits and pitfalls of projects that are blazing a trail for the use case.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder highlighted two key focal points of proof of personhood protocols, namely proving human identity and potential being a means to distribute universal basic income in the future.\n\n\u201cWorldcoin is unique in that it relies on highly sophisticated biometrics, scanning each user\u2019s iris using a piece of specialized hardware called \u201cthe Orb\u201d.\u201d\n\nAs Buterin explains, WorldCoin Orbs are set to be distributed around the world to allow users to create their respective digital ID. He also highlighted privacy and security concerns around the Orb, design issues regarding its native token and some ethical concerns around whether biometrics \u201care a good ideal at all\u201d.\n\nThe protocol was originally deployed on Polygon in its beta phase, while the current version runs on the Ethereum mainnet using a scalable batching architecture through layer 2 protocol Optimism. The project has over two millions users enrolled.\n\nSocioeconomic Considerations\n\nAs Buterin continues to explain, Worldcoin aims to produce Orbs to be widely distributed around the world in public spaces that will make digital IDs accessible for anyone to get.\n\nButeriun crediting Worldcoin for committing to decentralizing through a variety of technical aspects , including its architecture as a layer on Ethereum using Optimism\u2019s scaling SDK. Worldcoin also makes use of privacy centric zero-knowledge proofs, which allow a person to prove ownership of a credential without revealing any of the underlying data.\n\nNevertheless, efforts to ensure decentralization do not detract from criticisms against the protocol which Buterin highlighted, including privacy and security concerns around the Orb, issues with its WLD tokens and ethical issues relating to company decisions.\n\nButerin opined that broader considerations around biometrics and proof of personhood projects are \u201ca good idea at all\u201d:\n\n\u201cRisks include unavoidable privacy leaks, further erosion of people\u2019s ability to navigate the internet anonymously, coercion by authoritarian governments, and the potential impossibility of being secure at the same time as being decentralized.\u201d\n\nFour Major Risks\n\nButerin\u2019s essay outlines four major risks that come to mind when considering Worldcoin\u2019s approach to proof of personhood.\n\nThe first is privacy and whether the registry that contains human iris scans may reveal information:\n\n\u201cAt the very least, if someone else scans your iris, they can check it against the database to determine whether or not you have a World ID. Potentially, iris scans might reveal more information.\u201d\n\nWorld IDs are not easily accessible and may not be reliably accessible around the world unless the hardware is mass produced and easily accessible.\n\nButerin highlights centralization as another risk, considering that the Orb is a hardware device which leaves users with no way of verifying that it was built properly and doesn\u2019t have \u201cbackdoors\u201d:\n\n\u201cHence, even if the software layer is perfect and fully decentralized, the Worldcoin Foundation still has the ability to insert a backdoor into the system, letting it create arbitrarily many fake human identities.\u201d\n\nSecurity is the fourth risk, with Buterin pointing to scenarios like mobile device hacks or social engineering schemes:\n\n\u201cUsers could be coerced into scanning their irises while showing a public key that belongs to someone else, and there is the possibility of 3D-printing \u201cfake people\u201d that can pass the iris scan and get World IDs.\u201d\n\nButerin also joked that despite the \u201cdystopian vibez\u201d of staring into an Orb to scan your eyeballs, the specialized hardware systems \u201ccan do quite a decent job of protecting privacy\u201d. However this comes with the caveat of the centralization required to produce and manage the hardware.\n\nSecurity Issues of Proof of Personhood\n\nAs a gauge of where the proof of personhood ecosystem is at, Buterin also provides a handful of concerns that affect projects of similar designs.\n\nThis included the possibility of 3D-printed fake people, where a user could use AI to generate photographs or even 3D prints of fake people that are convincing enough to get accepted by the Orb software.\n\n\u201cIf even one group does this, they can generate an unlimited number of identities.\u201d\n\nButerin also suggested the possibility of selling IDs, where one user provides someone else\u2019s public key instead of their own when registering, giving that person control of their registered ID, in exchange for money.\n\n\u201cThis seems to be happening already. In addition to selling, there\u2019s also the possibility of renting IDs to use for a short time in one application.\u201d\n\nPhone hacking is another risk, giving an attacker full control of a users World ID. Lastly Butering also says there\u2019s a risk of a government forcing citizens to get verified while showing a QR code belonging to the government.\n\n\u201cIn this way, a malicious government could gain access to millions of IDs. In a biometric system, this could even be done covertly: governments could use obfuscated Orbs to extract World IDs from everyone entering their country at the passport control booth.\u201d\n\nWhile some of these dystopian risks sound far-fetched, Buterin believes they are points that have to be carefully considered as the drive to create proof of personhood protocols that are beneficial, secure and privacy-preserving"
