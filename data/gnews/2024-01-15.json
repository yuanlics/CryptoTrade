The cryptocurrency has been trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, and there is a possibility that it might extend its losses. The price corrected gains after reaching a new multi-week high near $2,716 and then declined below the $2,600 and $2,550 levels.\n\nThe next major resistance for Ethereum is near $2,585, and a clear move above this level could send the price towards $2,650. However, if Ethereum fails to clear the $2,520 resistance, it could continue to move down and potentially reach the $2,350 support level. Any further losses could send the price towards the $2,240 level.\n\nTechnical indicators such as the MACD and RSI are losing momentum in the bullish zone, which could indicate a potential reversal in the trend.
