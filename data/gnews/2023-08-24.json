        "content": "Firms viewed by many as leading contenders in the bitcoin ETF race are also keen on launching funds associated with ether futures contracts.\n\nArk Invest and 21Shares are listed as sub-advisers on the proposed ARK 21Shares Active Ethereum Futures ETF (ARKZ) and the ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF (ARKY), according to a Thursday filing.\n\nThe fund adviser on both planned products is Empowered Funds, a subsidiary of white-label ETF platform Alpha Architect.\n\nThe document notes that ARKZ would invest at least 25% of its total assets in cash-settled ether futures contracts, such as those traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). It may also invest in US Treasury securities, money market instruments and repurchase agreements.\n\nARKY would be similar, but would invest in both bitcoin futures and ether futures contracts, as well as its own planned ETFs that hold such contracts.\n\nThe funds mirror similar filings launched by a range of issuers in recent weeks. Sources told Blockworks earlier this month that the Securities and Exchange Commission is now ready to consider approving ether futures ETFs. This comes after reports in May suggested the regulator had requested issuers to pause its efforts in introducing such products to the market.\n\nRead more: SEC now ready to consider ETH futures ETFs, sources say \u2014 but what\u2019s changed?\n\nArk Invest and 21Shares first partnered to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021. The SEC blocked its first two attempts and is currently reviewing the companies\u2019 latest proposal.\n\nThe firms most recently re-filed for such a product in April \u2014 two months before BlackRock revealed plans to try to launch a bitcoin ETF, spurring other fund issuers to jump back into the race.\n\nThe SEC said on Aug. 11 that it would \u201cinstitute proceedings\u201d to determine whether it should approve or deny the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAfter the SEC delayed its decision on the spot bitcoin ETF proposal, Ark Invest and 21Shares shared plans to try to launch three types of bitcoin futures ETFs, including one that would also invest in crypto- and blockchain-related equities.\n\nEmpowered Funds was also listed as the adviser of that planned product trio.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Despite its performance in 2023, its technicals present an appealing case. Overcoming the $27 resistance could trigger substantial upside potential, targeting $32.40 and potentially $40-plus gains in 2023.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD)\n\nAvalanche AVAX symbol.

Partnerships, transaction growth, and innovation highlight its resilience and potential in the crypto landscape.\n\nAVAX, Avalanche\u2019s native token, serves as a unit of account, pays network fees, and supports blockchain security through staking. Avalanche and Solana are fast, scalable blockchain platforms with distinct differences. This includes both platforms support DeFi and dApps. However, Solana emphasizes decentralized exchanges, attracting notable DeFi projects.\n\nStory continues\n\nAvalanche\u2019s Q2 2023 DeFi metrics are mixed: daily active addresses doubled, but Total Value Locked (TVL) fell 19%, raising concerns.
