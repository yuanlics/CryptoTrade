Our findings show that:\n\n* AWS Graviton-based instances, particularly C7g and M7g, offer good performance and cost-effectiveness for popular Ethereum clients like Geth and Erigon.\n* EBS gp3 volumes with sufficient IOPS are a cost-effective choice, while io2 volumes provide more consistent performance.\n* FSx for OpenZFS is a good option for fast volume provisioning, but it's not compatible with Erigon.\n* The recommended configurations vary based on the node's role, whether it's a sync node or an RPC node serving dApps.\n* Regular monitoring and evaluation of performance and cost-efficiency are necessary to ensure optimal node operation and maintain a reliable service for the Ethereum network and dApps.\n\nThe authors are Senior Solutions Architect at AWS, Nikolay Vlasov, and Solutions Arch"

The pattern involves short bursts of decline followed by an ascending trend, which has played out in previous summers and could happen again this summer. However, there are also bearish signals on the chart, including a head and shoulders pattern that could suggest further declines. Despite these mixed signals, Ethereum is gearing up for a major move as its Bollinger bandwidth is at its narrowest since 2018. Additionally, Ethereum will launch a new testnet called \"Holesky\" in September, which could pave the way for two upcoming upgrades. The direction of ETH's next move remains uncertain, but the potential for a rally is intriguing."

Additionally, Bitstamp will delist 7 American tokens from trading in the US, including Solana, Decentraland, Polygon, Near, Axie Infinity, Chiliz (CHZ), and The Sandbox. The decision appears to be a response to recent SEC legal actions against Binance and Coinbase, which declared all seven tokens to be unregistered securities in June. Despite the regulatory challenges, the price of Ether (ETH) has been rising, with the total value staked for the asset increasing steadily. The classification of ETH as a security or commodity is a key concern in the current regulatory landscape in the US, with the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler,"
