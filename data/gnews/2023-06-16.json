        "title": "Frax Finance to launch Ethereum Layer 2 named Fraxtal - The Block",
        "content": "The team behind Frax Finance, known for creating the Frax stablecoin, has unveiled its strategy to introduce a Layer 2 blockchain: Fraxtal (originally called Fraxchain).\n\nThe team said the network will be directed towards creating a smart contract platform with a strong emphasis on decentralized finance. \u201cFraxchain essentially represents the culmination of the entire Frax ecosystem and all of the traction and usage that we\u2019ve gained,\u201d Frax founder Sam Kazemian told The Block.\n\nThe network is expected be ready by the end of the year. Fraxtal's governance will be led by the holders of Frax Shares (FXS) tokens. The network will employ the use of the Frax stablecoin and Frax Ether, Frax's liquid staking derivative, for transaction fees. Furthermore, fees generated by the roll-up network could be partly burned or redirected back to the Ethereum mainnet to be distributed among stakers of FXS governance token, Kazemian added.\n\nIncorporating a Layer 2 rollup model in its design, Fraxtal will publish state roots to the Ethereum mainnet for securing the network.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe network will incorporate decentralized sequencers. These sequencers are specialized nodes responsible for ordering transactions into batches in a rollup network. They will be operated by any entity chosen via a governance vote. This feature, according to Kazemian, will differentiate Fraxtal from other Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum, which typically depend on a single sequencer.\n\n\u201cFraxchain proposes a solution where sequencer roles can be auctioned off and rotated, creating a decentralized sequencer base. If a sequencer is forced to shut down, it would allow the next elected sequencer to pick up from where the previous one left off,\u201d Kazemian said."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Consolidates Below $1,720: What Could Trigger Another Decline? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price is still struggling below $1,720 against the US Dollar. ETH could continue to move down if it stays below $1,700 and $1,720.\n\nEthereum is slowly moving higher from the $1,620 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,720 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could struggle to recover above the $1,700 and $1,720 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Faces Uphill Task\n\nEthereum\u2019s price remained in a bearish zone below the $1,720 resistance. ETH extended its decline below the $1,660 level, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a spike below the $1,630 support. The price tested the $1,620 zone. A low is formed near $1,620 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $1,640 and $1,650 levels. The bulls pushed the price toward the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,748 swing high to the $1,620 low.\n\nEther is still trading below $1,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,720 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,700 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,748 swing high to the $1,620 low. The next major resistance is near the $1,720 level and the trend line.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA proper move above the $1,700 and $1,720 resistance levels might start a steady recovery wave. The next resistance sits near $1,775, above which Ethereum could rise toward the $1,820 level. Any more gains above the $1,820 resistance zone might send the price toward the $1,850 resistance.\n\nFresh Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,700 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,640 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,620 level. If there is a break and close below the $1,620 support, the price could dive toward the $1,550 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,500 zone.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,700\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum 'Restaking' Protocol EigenLayer Launches On Mainnet - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "EigenLayer, a highly anticipated \u201crestaking\" protocol for Ethereum, successfully completed the initial guarded stage of its mainnet launch on Wednesday.\n\nUsers can now deposit liquid staking tokens (LSTs) into the protocol, or set up and configure an EigenPod to natively restake ETH. The protocol supports Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, and Coinbase\u2019s cbETH tokens, with plans to onboard other LSTs in the future.\n\nOnce its rollout is complete, EigenLayer will allow Ethereum stakers to validate third-party services for a yield while simultaneously earning staking rewards for securing the network.\n\n\u201cEigenLayer aims to empower the ecosystem stakeholders and innovate on both the future of shared security, as well as the future of decentralization,\u201d the project said in a blog post.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s liquid staking pools are currently capped at 3,200 tokens each, with individual deposits limited to 32 tokens per transaction. The creation of new EigenPods will pause once native staking exceeds 9,600 ETH. Withdrawal requests will execute after a seven-day delay.\n\n$32B Market\n\nEigenLayer is seeking to harness Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem as a shared security layer, but its success may hinge on its ability to compete with DeFi protocols as a source of additional yield for stakers.\n\nPopular LSTs like stETH and rETH enjoy integrations with a wide range of DeFi protocols, offering holders a variety of strategies for generating yield or accessing liquidity while continuing to accumulate staking rewards.\n\nAlthough Ethereum\u2019s staked capitalization is already $32.5B, only 16% of circulating Ether is staked, suggesting the sector may still have significant room to grow.\n\nRestaking\n\nThe Ethereum network validates code written in its native Solidity programming language that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Ethereum\u2019s core smart contract engine.\n\nEigenLayer allows stakers to also opt-in to validate modules containing non-EVM code, also called \u201cActively Validated Services (AVSs),\u201d by harnessing Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem as a shared security layer.\n\nStory continues\n\nEigenLayer said the second phase of its launch would introduce \u201cOperators,\u201d which perform validation tasks for AVSs built on the EigenLayer protocol. AVSs will come online later, completing EigenLayer\u2019s mainnet launch.\n\n\u201cRestakers have the flexibility to delegate their staked ETH to Operators or run validation services themselves, effectively becoming an Operator,\u201d EigenLayer said. \u201cRestakers retain agency over their stake and choose which AVSs they opt-in to validate for.\u201d\n\nOperators and restakers face additional penalties if an AVS they secure misbehaves or if they fail to perform validation duties, on top of the regular slashing risks associated with staking.\n\nVitalik Buterin recently warned against protocols seeking to leverage Ethereum\u2019s social consensus mechanism for purposes other than securing the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cWe should be wary of application-layer projects taking actions that risk increasing the \u2018scope\u2019 of blockchain consensus to anything other than verifying the core Ethereum protocol rules,\u201d Buterin said in a blog post last month.\n\nSreeram Kannan, EigenLayer\u2019s founder, described Vitalik\u2019s critique as an \u201cexcellent analysis,\u201d advocating for restakers to use the protocol for \u201clow-risk\u201d activities.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe protocol\u2019s contracts are upgradeable and pausable. Three multisig governance wallets oversee contract upgrades, pause functionality, and protocol parameter adjustments respectively.\n\nEigenLayer described the setup as a temporary governance solution and said it intends to decentralize in the future. Its multisig signers include Tim Beiko from the Ethereum Foundation, Swapnil Raj from Nethermind, and Ben Rodriguez from Coinbase Cloud.\n\n\u201cThese multisigs represent a rudimentary but working system of transparent initial governance, with appropriate checks and balances,\u201d EigenLayer said.\n\nConsenSys and Sigma Prime audited EigenLayer\u2019s code. The project is also offering $2M in bug bounties via Immunefi."
