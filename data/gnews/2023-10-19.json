        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as $1,800 Level Comes into Play \u2013 What Are the Indicators Showing?\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe Ethereum price has dropped by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, dipping to $1,619 as the market as a whole falls by roughly the same percentage within the same amount of time.\n\nETH has now declined by 6% in the past week, although the market\u2019s biggest altcoin remains up by 2.5% in a fortnight and by 35% since the beginning of the year.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency has struggled to remain above $1,700 this month, while its 200-day average continues to hover around $1,800, indicating just how oversold it still is at the moment.\n\nOn the other hand, this also suggests that ETH is due a rebound and soon, and with its fundamentals remaining very strong, such a rebound is only a matter of time.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as $1,800 Level Comes into Play \u2013 What Are the Indicators Showing?\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that ETH is in the middle of a short-term downswing right now, with its indicators all looking fairly weak.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nFirstly, its price has dropped by its 30-day exponential moving average (yellow), which itself remains some way below the coin\u2019s 200-day average (blue), all of which indicates big selling pressure.\n\nSecondly, ETH\u2019s relative strength index (purple) is falling slowly below 50, something which also signals an excess of selling, but which also suggest that such selling could continue for a while longer yet (since the RSI hasn\u2019t fallen to 30 or 20).\n\nHaving said that, it will be interesting to see whether ETH\u2019s current support level (green) can resist a fall below $1,600 or so.\n\nIf it can, ETH may recover sooner rather than later, yet a drop below this key psychological level may forecast further losses.\n\nEither way, Ethereum remains one of the most fundamentally attractive altcoins in the market, and given that it is massively below its current 200-day average of $1,800, it really should rebound soon.\n\nIndeed, recent losses have nothing specifically to do with Ethereum on a fundamental level, with market negativity surrounding rising bond yields, for instance, depressing stocks and other speculative assets (including cryptos).\n\nYet Ethereum remains in the same position it was when it last rallied at the start of the month, with the layer-one blockchain accounting for the vast bulk of the total value locked in of the DeFi sector (particularly when you include ETH-based layer-two networks).\n\nAnd as we never tire of pointing out, recent months have seen some major adoption news for Ethereum, with PayPal launching its own ETH-based stablecoin and Visa conducting stablecoin trials on its network."

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Below $2,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's hard to deny how wonderful an investment Ethereum (ETH 4.70%) has been. As of this writing, the token's price is up more than 52,000% since its public launch in July 2015.\n\nThat's an impressive gain, but it hasn't been a smooth ride for investors. Ethereum currently sits 68% off its all-time high price, set in November 2021.\n\nIs it smart to buy this top cryptocurrency while it's still below $2,000? Let's look at the reasons both for and against this decision.\n\nBuying the dip could be a smart move\n\nThe obvious reason to be a buyer right now is how beaten-down Ethereum's price is. During the huge bull run in 2021, crypto markets drew a lot of enthusiasm from the investment community looking for quick profits. Things certainly look to have been in bubble territory. In the years since, there has been a bit of a normalization, which might be a good thing.\n\nRapidly rising interest rates crushed the stock and crypto markets in 2022. And it introduced a prolonged market downturn in digital assets, even though Ethereum has climbed this year.\n\nAll else equal, investing in something when its price is lower is a better move. Should things still play out as hoped, the upside is greater than if you had bought at a higher price. This could be the situation with Ethereum right now.\n\nSome investors are bullish on Ethereum for its game-changing potential, primarily in the world of decentralized applications (dApps). That this blockchain has capabilities to build smart contracts has caused many believers to see a lot of use cases developing over time.\n\nWhile the activity around decentralized finance protocols and non-fungible tokens has cooled off, Ethereum remains the leader in these innovations. Thus, when the market rebounds, as it has done in the past, demand for the blockchain could soar once again with a growing dApp ecosystem.\n\nEthereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism 13 months ago might have won over a lot of people. This move reduced the network's energy usage by more than 99%, which will certainly go over well with climate activists. It paves the way for a more sustainable future.\n\nEthereum is too risky\n\nThere are also some clear reasons not to buy Ethereum -- despite its price being below $2,000 at the moment. Cryptocurrencies might simply be way too volatile for some investors. This issue is more of a concern for those who are near or in retirement. Owning Ethereum exposes the portfolio to wild valuation swings, which could be too hard to stomach.\n\nSome naysayers might also argue that there isn't even a need for Ethereum. In other words, it's a solution looking for a problem to solve.\n\nTake financial services, for example. DeFi promises to remove intermediaries, which might lead to better consumer pricing and rates. But as we've seen with the failures of major crypto firms, things are opaque and too complex to understand. For all its faults, the current financial system is adequate for most people, and that could eliminate the demand for DeFi services.\n\nEthereum faces regulatory uncertainty, too. Is it a security? If the Securities and Exchange Commission one day rules that it is, that means Ethereum will have to abide by comprehensive reporting requirements. And this could result in heightened public scrutiny of the crypto.\n\nThere's even a possibility that Ethereum won't get back to its all-time high ever. The euphoria that characterized the market in 2021 might be a one-hit wonder.\n\nOn one hand, I can see why some investors might be interested in starting a tiny position in Ethereum, primarily as a result of its potential. But I'm in the camp that says it's better to probably be a bit more critical and avoid the crypto altogether or await further developments."
