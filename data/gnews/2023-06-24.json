        "summary": "  Sure, here's a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nEther (ETH) price is eyeing $3,000 as exchange balances hit an all-time low. Exchanges hold 12.6% of ETH, down from 30% in the last 30 days. Withdrawals from exchanges have surged, similar to November 2022 levels, indicating bullish sentiment. Staking deposits have also increased significantly since April's Shapella upgrade. The ETH/USD pair is facing resistance at $1,900, but a breakout above could lead to a push towards $3,000. The ETH/BTC pair is looking to establish support around 0.06255 BTC, but oversold readings suggest a pullback is likely. The funding rate for ETH perpetual swap contracts has surged, indicating increased demand for short positions. On-chain movements and market indicators suggest the upside has a higher chance over a short- to medium-term bearish trend."

        "summary": "  ERC 6551 is a new standard for Ethereum non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that allows them to act as non-custodial wallets, enabling users to send and receive transactions, store their own NFTs, and participate in airdrops. The standard is backward-compatible, meaning that every existing NFT can be upgraded to a TBA (token-bound account). ERC 6551 is an extension of ERC 721, the most common standard for Ethereum NFTs, and it paves the way for more immersive, transparent, and feature-rich experiences in the Web3 space. The activation of ERC 6551 can change the narrative of NFT usage, economics, and functionality on Ethereum and other EVM blockchains."

This trend has been observed since the Shapella Upgrade in April, with a sharp spike in staked ETH and a corresponding drop in exchange supply. The convergence suggests that people are taking ETH out of the market and using it as a savings option, even though staking rewards have decreased over time. However, the overall profitability of the network has increased, with a positive 30-Day MVRV Ratio and a hike in the Age Consumed metric."
