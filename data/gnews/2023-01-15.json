        "summary": "  Polygon (MATIC) is experiencing a bull run as the company conducts performance evaluations of its zero-knowledge roll-up technology before integrating it with the mainnet. The technology, called zkEVM, deploys the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for zero-knowledge proofs, allowing developers to use their existing smart contracts without additional programming. The team has successfully generated over 12,000 zk-proofs in the primary version of the zkEVM testnet, with the technology poised to have a major impact on the Ethereum ecosystem by providing greater privacy and security for transactions. The price of MATIC has increased significantly, breaking through key resistance levels and reaching $0.98, with a 10% increase in the daily chart and a 23.32% increase in the weekly chart. A hard fork for Polygon is scheduled for January 17th, which could result in a potential increase in the price of MATIC."
