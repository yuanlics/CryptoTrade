The price of SOL has more than doubled this month, rising more than 58 percent to $23.70 in the last seven days, according to CoinGecko.\n\nNot only that, but the once-celebrated \"Ethereum killer\" saw its highest trading volume since the week of the spectacular collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which crashed Solana along with most of the crypto market in November.\n\nIt's a remarkable rebound for Solana. Less than a month ago, SOL was closing out the year down 94 percent, hitting a two-year low of $8.17 and dropping out of the top twenty coins, per CoinGecko data.\n\nNow, Solana briefly bumped Polygon MATIC out of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, which cleared $9 million on Saturday afternoon. Its price is also at its highest point since FTX fell. In one 24-hour period last weekend alone, Solana jumped 21 percent.\n\nCan I just say, I\u2019m proud of all you that have been GRINDING through this ass kicking.

Coin collectors seemed eager to celebrate a new dog-themed entry into the marketplace, alongside Dogecoin (DOGE) and the Ethereum-based token Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nBONK logged an eye-popping 3,300% spike in the first week of the year\u2014albeit to $0.00000487, according to CoinGecko. While a subsequent five-trillion token burn didn't keep BONK on an upward trajectory, its price sliding 69 percent last week, it's still sitting atop a $57 million market cap.

More than six leading crypto firms have folded since then, with some like Voyager and BlockFi filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy. The collapse of FTX two months ago dealt a further blow to the sector, destroying billions of US dollars worth of user assets and threatening the future of more crypto firms.\n\nThis, however, did not interfere with the substratum of blockchain technology which continues to operate as intended, according to Wood.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX, underlying public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have not skipped a beat in processing transactions, highlighting that their transparent, decentralized, and auditable ledgers could be a solution to the fraud and mismanagement associated with centralized, opaque institutions,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pundit also fronted Digital wallets as the next big thing, noting that they were replacing cash and credit cards. A recent report by California-based market research and consulting firm Grand View Research estimated the global crypto market wallet market to grow to about $48.27 billion in 2030 from 2022 estimates of about $8.42 billion. Crypto wallets help users keep their crypto assets safe and secure by storing their private keys. They also allow users to send, receive and spend cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin. Digital wallets overtook cash as the top transaction method for offline commerce in 2020 and accounted for ~50% of global online commerce volume in 2021.\n\nWood Buys More Crypto-Related Shares\n\nFollowing the FTX collapse, the share of trading volume on decentralized exchanges, which allow investors to trade without a central intermediary spiked 37%. Centralized crypto exchanges such as Binance and Crypto.com also saw a drastic increase in outflows as investors took flight in fear of an FTX-like incident.\n\nWood continued to express hope in the crypto sector, scooping more Coinbase shares. According to her, unlike other exchanges, \u201cthe fallout from Terra/Luna\u2019s and FTX\u2019s collapses propelled Coinbase\u2019s share of fiat-based exchange volume (excluding Binance International) by 18 percentage points, from 22% in June to 40% in December.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Ark Invest purchased 74,792 shares of Coinbase (COIN) for around $3.28 million, bringing its total holdings to 8.596 million shares valued at around $408.7 million based on Coinbase\u2019s last closing price of $47.55 on Thursday. That stash now represents 2.92% of the firm\u2019s entire portfolio allocation."
