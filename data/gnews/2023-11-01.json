        "content": "Ethereum is reclaiming dominance relative to its Layer 2 ecosystem, with the daily activity on L2s falling by one-third in the last six weeks.\n\nAccording to L2beat, combined Layer 2 throughput is down 32% since peaking at 64.2 transactions per second (TPS) on Sept. 14, currently sitting at 43.8TPS. For comparison, Ethereum averages 12.6 TPS, a 1.6% increase over the same period.\n\nEthereum posted a brief spike to 18.8 TPS on Sept. 13 \u2014 buoyed by users bridging assets over to Base \u2014 but has consistently trended near 12 TPS throughout 2023.\n\nEthereum Mainnet Reclaims Dominance From Layer 2s\n\nL2 hype dies down\n\nMuch of the Layer 2 drawdown can be attributed to freshly deployed networks experiencing a retraction in activity after an initial wave of hype and incentives.\n\nThe initial frenzy of activity on Base, Coinbase\u2019s OP Stack-based L2, has well and truly died down following its August mainnet launch. Base is now processing just at 3 transactions per second, down from 21.3 TPS on Sept. 14.\n\nZkSync Era\u2019s throughput has slumped 50% since peaking at 15.2 TPS on Aug 26, despite Era now leading the Layer 2 sector by activity. Starknet is also down 53% from its Sep. 9 high at 4.7 TPS.\n\nThe top L2s by total value locked, long-standing incumbents Arbitrum and Optimism, suffered similar retracements. Arbitrum closely follows ZkSync Era with 7.3 TPS, down from a record high of 31.6 TPS amid the airdrop for its ARB token in March.\n\nThe OP Mainnet currently sits at 2.5 TPS, down from 10.4 in late July. However, the OP Labs team has since shifted its focus to supporting other L2s, including Base, with its OP Stack.\n\nDespite the pull-back, Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 project is emerging has succeeded in its mission.\n\nLayer 2 networks are driving more than 4.6 times as much activity than Ethereum\u2019s base layer, meaning Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem is facilitating far greater throughput at a fraction of the cost compared to before its L2 sector took off.\n\nTo continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io"
