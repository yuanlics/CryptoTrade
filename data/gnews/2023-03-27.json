        "content": "Polygon launched the long-awaited mainnet for its new Polygon zkEVM network today, and to mark the occasion, the core developers of the sidechain invited Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin to send out the very first transaction\u2014and he included a hidden message.\n\nButerin appeared on a livestreamed event to mark the occasion, and while building the transaction, he included the following message converted into hex code: \u201cA few million constraints for man, unconstrained scalability for mankind.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Buterin repeatedly set the Ethereum network transaction gas limit to 69,042, potentially referencing one meme number (69) and nearly another one (420) as well. Polygon Labs Head of Growth Sanket Shah tweeted that the gas limit number made the Ethereum creator a \u201cman of culture.\u201d\n\n.@VitalikButerin did the symbolic first ever transaction on @0xPolygon #zkEVM and it has a message on it \"Millions of constraints for man, unconstrained scalability for mankind\" Goose bumps!! https://t.co/HLNiVyRLie pic.twitter.com/Ue0C1CuDTd \u2014 Sandeep Nailwal | sandeep. polygon \ud83d\udc9c (@sandeepnailwal) March 27, 2023\n\n\u201cAnd just like that, Vitalik Buterin has completed the first transaction on the newly deployed Polygon zkEVM chain,\u201d Polygon Labs President Ryan Wyatt tweeted this morning. \u201cThis is a big moment for scaling decentralized protocols to handle our growth.\u201d\n\nPolygon zkEVM is billed as a next-generation blockchain network that enables faster and cheaper transactions that Ethereum\u2019s own mainnet can handle.\n\n.@VitalikButerin sent the transaction on Polygon zkEVM He is a man of culture. Ensure that the gas limit is 69042 pic.twitter.com/Eh0ebi7giA \u2014 sanket.polygon | polygon zkEVM on 27th March (@sourcex44) March 27, 2023\n\nUnlike previous layer-2 and sidechain networks, a zkEVM pairs zero-knowledge rollups\u2014which bundle together loads of transactions and execute those proofs onto Ethereum\u2014with full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. That means that it\u2019s a native complement to Ethereum and that smart contracts, which contain the code that powers decentralized protocols and software, can be easily moved over to the zkEVM network.\n\nStory continues\n\nPolygon Launches Final Mainnet for zkEVM Solution to Scale Ethereum\n\n\u201czkEVM can be recognized as the \u2018holy grail\u2019 of blockchain scaling,\u201d Polygon\u2019s co-founder Mihailo Bjelic told Decrypt ahead of today\u2019s launch.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only zkEVM network out there, however: others are in development, and rival zkSync launched its own mainnet last week ahead of Polygon\u2019s previously-announced move."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\ndYdX announced the launch of its V4 private testnet this Tuesday, taking a significant step that will see the decentralized derivatives exchange (DEX) leave Ethereum.\n\nBy the end of September, the platform will be fully running on Cosmos.\n\nThe network allows developer teams to spin up their own native blockchains using the Cosmos Software Development Kit (SDK) according to their own preferences. Though distinct, each independent Cosmos-based blockchain can interact with one another.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe private testnet for dYdX is set to launch this Tuesday and run for two to three weeks. After that, a public testnet will be launched by the end of July.\n\nThe platform cited the lack of scalability on Ethereum as the main reason for the move.\n\n\"We reached a point where Ethereum couldn't process the transactions fast enough,\" dYdX\u2019s marketing lead Nathan Cha told Decrypt at this year\u2019s Paris Blockchain Week.\n\nThis is the second project to announce its migration from Ethereum to Cosmos. SushiSwap is also making the same move after the project acquired the Cosmos-based trading platform Vortex Protocol last month.\n\nThe teams explored various options, including Solana and layer-2 solutions. \"We came to the conclusion that Cosmos was the better option because we can customize the blockchain to our needs,\u201d said Cha. \u201cNow we can handle transactions at a faster pace.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\ndYdX and centralized exchanges\n\nLaunched in 2017 by Antonio Juliano, who previously worked at Coinbase and Uber as a software engineer, dYdX currently has roughly $341.5 million in total value locked (TVL), per DeFi Llama.\n\nTVL is a metric used to measure how much money is sloshing around in a given DeFi protocol. Lido Finance, a liquid staking protocol, currently has the largest TVL at a whopping $10.4 billion.\n\nThough decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, Curve, and dYdX are steadily growing, they still only account for a small share of transactions compared to their centralized counterparts. Trading volume over the past day, Uniswap has facilitated more than $642 million in orders. Binance has processed more than $4.28 billion in trades over the same period.\n\nContrary to expectations at the time, the collapse of FTX last November did not significantly change this proportion.\n\n\"After FTX, we saw a 20-30% increase in trading volume, but only for a short time,\" David Gogel, Vice President of the dYdX Foundation, told Decrypt. \"The companies that benefited the most from the FTX case are other centralized exchanges. People don't really know about self-custody, and there's still a lot of work to do to educate them. It's a complicated journey.\""

        "title": "Polygon's zkEVM Goes Live on Ethereum Mainnet - Blockworks",
        "content": "The options for layer-2 scaling are expanding as Polygon launches its long-awaited zkEVM technology on Ethereum mainnet today.\n\nThe zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine is a technology that can execute smart contract transactions in a way that can prove the information is executed correctly without revealing the information itself on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, thereby bundling more transactions in less mainnet blockspace.\n\nSandeep Nailwal, the co-founder and chief operating officer of Polygon, told Blockworks this type of technology is considered the \u201choly grail of scaling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the power of mathematics\u2026you can compute something off-chain on layer-2, then verify everything back on Ethereum in a very succinct way in a very short amount of time,\u201d Nailwal said.\n\nPolygon\u2019s launch on Ethereum comes just days after Matter Labs zkSync Era opened to the public on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nSimilar to zkSync\u2019s offering, the Polygon zkEVM\u2019s code is open-source, but under an AGPL v3 license.\n\n\u201cThat means that not only current repositories, but all future modifications and distributions as well, will remain open source, ensuring the code cannot be used for proprietary purposes,\u201d Nailwal said.\n\nNailwal notes that Polygon zkEVM is EVM equivalent, whereas zkSync\u2019s offering is EVM compatible.\n\nAccording to the framework laid out by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in August 2022, zkSync Era is classified as a \u201cType-4 (high-level-language equivalent),\u201d and there are advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to bringing the EVM to a zero-knowledge rollup. The merits of various tradeoffs are an ongoing topic of debate.\n\nLike zkSync Era, and the current crop of optimistic rollups, the Polygon zkEVM is not yet decentralized, but eventually, Nailwal hopes that Polygon\u2019s new offering will take that step.\n\n\u201cEverything is in the hands of the community,\u201d he said.\n\nSecurity comes first\n\nIn addition to three internal audits, Nailwal notes that Polygon\u2019s zkEVM has also gone through two rounds of external security audits from blockchain cybersecurity companies Hexens and Spearbit.\n\nOngoing, continuous audits are expected for the next three to four months following mainnet launch and a multi-million dollar bounty program will also be in place, he said.\n\nThe emphasis on security was also central to zkSync Era\u2019s mainnet release, but Polygon said that Matter Labs had shared audits that cover their smart contracts and sequencer, not their prover.\n\n\u201cThis raises serious questions about security, at least until a full audit is released. The prover for Polygon zkEVM, meanwhile, has been audited, and is open-source,\u201d Brendan Farmer, Polygon Zero co-founder, told Blockworks.\n\nA spokesperson for zkSync told Blockworks that the prover had been audited by Halborn Security, and pointed to the blockchain\u2019s documentation, which notes that a recently completed review has not yet been published.\n\nEven conscientious security measures can leave gaps, however, and Nailwal notes that he does not wish users to bring millions of dollars to the zkEVM immediately.\n\n\u201cZk is new technology\u2026so we [want] people [to be] as cautious as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nDrawing on the example of the recent Euler Finance attacks, Nailwal cautioned that interacting with smart contracts is not without risk.\n\n\u201cEuler, after running for two years, a bug was found \u2014 this can happen any day, on any smart contract-based application.\u201d he said.\n\nZkEVMs are sure to be compared to their optimistic rollup counterparts \u2014 the most successful to-date being Optimism and Arbitrum.\n\n\u201cArbitrum took one and a half years before people actually started bringing in money,\u201d Nailwal said. \u201cSo we don\u2019t expect people to bring a lot of money [initially].\u201d\n\nUpdated March 28, 2023 at 2:58 pm ET: After initial publication, Polygon announced the zkEVM prover would also be available under the AGPL v3 license, along with the rest of the codebase.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
