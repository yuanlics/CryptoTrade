        "content": "Ethereum Restaking Protocol EigenLayer Surpasses $900M in Deposits\n\nEigenLayer, a protocol for restaking and cross-chain security on Ethereum (ETH), has witnessed a remarkable surge in user deposits, surpassing the $900 million mark. This represents a nearly fourfold increase in just a few days.\n\nThe protocol's total value locked (TVL) has climbed from $250 million to over $900 million following adjustments to deposit caps for liquid staking assets. EigenLayer raised its re-staking limit from 120,000 ETH to 500,000 ETH, equivalent to approximately $1.1 billion.\n\nEigenLayer enables users to deposit and \"re-stake\" ether from various liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to secure third-party networks. The protocol's stage 1 launched on the Ethereum mainnet in June. In addition to supporting LSTs from Lido, Rocket Pool, and Coinbase at launch, EigenLayer has expanded its range to include six additional LSTs: Swell's swETH, Stakewise's sETH, Stader's xETH, Origin's oETH, Ankr's ankrETH, and Wrapped Beacon Ether (wBETH).\n\nThe increase in deposit caps and the wider range of LSTs have fueled a surge in activity, with many users depositing funds to participate in the network and earn points. EigenLabs, the company behind EigenLayer, closed a $50 million Series A funding round in March, led by Blockchain Capital.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Peter Brandt, a veteran commodities trader, on Monday warned that Ethereum ETH/USD is set to drop over 75%.\n\nWhat Happened: Brandt believes that classical chart patterns in price charts are not always reliable, even though the rising wedge in Ethereum aligns perfectly with expectations, with a potential target of $1,000 and then $650 if it follows the script.\n\n\"Classical chart patterns in price charts are not sacred \u2013 they fail to perform according to the textbooks all the time. But, if the rising wedge in Ethereum $ETH complies with the script, the target is $1,000, then $650. I shorted ETH on Friday \u2014 I have a protective B/E stop,\" he said.\n\nSee More: Dogecoin HODLERs Are Beating Shiba Inu With 57% Landing In Profits, IntoTheBlock Data Reveals\n\nWhy It Matters: Last week, Brandt said he was skeptical about Ethereum\u2019s future. He said, \u201cETH is not comparable to BTC as a store of value. Why hodl ETH when you can hodl BTC? And the functionality and gas price of ETH make the crypto a piece of junk\u201d.\n\nAccording to Brandt, high transaction fees, also known as \u201cgas prices,\u201d make Ethereum a less desirable option in the long run. Additionally, he predicted that Ethereum may not even be a listed asset in ten years.\n\n\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,246 up 3.60% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Here\u2019s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?"
