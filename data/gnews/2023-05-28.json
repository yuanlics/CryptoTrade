        "summary": "  Bitcoin and Ethereum are vying for dominance in the non-fungible token (NFT) space, with two major events happening over the weekend: Veecon Indianapolis 2023 and the BTC Miami/Ordinals Conference 2023. The NFT community is split between the \"status quo\" ETH-based community and a newly emerged BTC-based community. At Forkast Labs, we work on CryptoSlam.io to include all new and relevant chains, and I met industry celebrities like Richerd Chan from Manifold.xyz.

        "summary": "  VanEck, a global investment manager, predicts that Ethereum (ETH) could reach $51,000 by 2030 if certain conditions are met. The company lays out three possible scenarios: base, bear, and bull cases. In the base case, ETH could reach $11,848.62, while in the bear case, it could fall to $343.29. The bull case projection of $51,006 is based on the assumption that Ethereum becomes the dominant open-source global settlement network. VanEck notes that ETH is evolving into a store-of-value asset, similar to Bitcoin, but with a different approach. However, the firm emphasizes that investors should do their own research and due diligence before making any high-risk investments in cryptocurrencies or digital assets."
