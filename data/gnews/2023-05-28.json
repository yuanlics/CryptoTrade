        "content": "Adding to the growing number of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol hacks in the crypto industry, Jimbos Protocol is the latest to suffer an attack resulting in a significant loss of funds.\n\nAccording to blockchain security firm PeckShield, Jimbos Protocol \u2014 the liquidity protocol of the Arbitrum system \u2014 was hacked on the morning of May 28. The attack resulted in the loss of 4,000 Ether (ETH), worth approximately $7.5 million at the time.\n\nSpecifically, the attacker took advantage of the lack of slippage control on liquidity conversions. The protocol\u2019s liquidity is invested in a price range that doesn\u2019t need to be equal, creating a loophole where attackers can reverse swap orders for their own gain.\n\nAlthough launched less than 20 days ago, Jimbos Protocol aimed to address liquidity and volatile token prices through a new testing approach. However, the protocol\u2019s mechanism was not adequately developed, leading to a logical vulnerability creating favorable conditions for attackers. As a consequence, the price of the underlying token, Jimbo (JIMBO), has plummeted by 40%.\n\nAccording to PeckShield\u2019s findings, the attackers extracted 4,090 ETH from the Arbitrum network. Subsequently, they utilized the Stargate bridge and the Celer Network to transfer approximately 4,048 ETH from the Ethereum network.\n\nHacking incidents in DeFi protocols is not a novel phenomenon. While reports indicate a significant decline in the number of attacks compared with previous years, the community continues to be exposed to numerous exploits.\n\nRelated: The Sandbox CEO\u2019s Twitter was hacked, used to promote alleged \u2018airdrop\u2019 scam\n\nDespite efforts to enhance security measures, the DeFi ecosystem grapples with the persistent challenge of safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities and unauthorized access. An example is the recent flash loan attack on the 0VIX protocol, resulting in a substantial loss of nearly $2 million.\n\nAnother recent noteworthy occurrence involved the hijacking of Tornado Cash, a prominent privacy-focused protocol. Unknown attackers successfully compromised the system and extracted significant quantities of Tornado Cash (TORN) tokens, leading to substantial financial losses.\n\nMagazine: Should crypto projects ever negotiate with hackers?

        "content": "Global investment manager VanEck says Ethereum (ETH) could hit $51,000 in less than seven years if certain conditions align.\n\nIn a new research report, VanEck lays out its base, bear and bull cases for Ethereum\u2019s performance going into the end of the decade.\n\nVanEck explains its methodology in finding its estimates:\n\n\u201cWe base these estimates on the thesis that Ethereum becomes the dominant open-source global settlement network that hosts substantial portions of the commercial activity of business sectors with the highest potential to gain from moving their business functions to public blockchains. In a portfolio of similar smart contract platforms, we assume to own a collection of call options, with the dominant platform likely to take a majority market share.\u201d\n\nAssuming that Ethereum is no longer the top settlement system or smart contract platform with only 15% dominance, VanEck says ETH could disintegrate as low as $343.29 by 2030 in its bear case.\n\nHowever, if things go well for Ethereum, VanEck lays out a base case price target of $11,848.62 and a bull case of $51,006.\n\nThe firm says that Ethereum is likely en route to becoming a store-of-value asset, similar to Bitcoin but perhaps in a slightly different manner.\n\n\u201cFinally, we assert that ETH is evolving beyond a transactional currency or a consumable commodity like oil or natural gas. We believe that ETH, while not a complete store of value like Bitcoin due to Ethereum\u2019s demonstrated mutability of code and an evolving social consensus focused on utility, will nevertheless become a store-of-value asset for state actors looking to maximize human capital (vs. Bitcoin, which maximizes for stranded energy).\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Could Be Replaced by Litecoin (LTC), but Investors Prefer Collateral Network (COLT) for the Biggest ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) might be replaced by Litecoin (LTC). However, the Collateral Network (COLT) is gaining recognition due to its promise of high returns. This network is both emerging and innovative. With Collateral Network currently in phase one of its presale, investors are keen to participate in this exciting opportunity.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nLitecoin (LTC): Could It Replace Ethereum?\n\nLitecoin (LTC) has made considerable progress in the crypto world, with recent developments sparking interest among investors. As a faster and more scalable alternative to Bitcoin, Litecoin has long been considered a robust investment. The Litecoin foundation has many benefits. However, they face intense competition from other projects, like the Collateral Network (COLT) which is growing quickly.\n\nDespite its numerous advantages, The Litecoin foundation faces stiff competition from other projects in the market, such as the rapidly growing Collateral Network (COLT). While the Litecoin network has a loyal following, it remains uncertain whether it can genuinely unseat Ethereum as the go-to platform for developers and users or outshine the potential returns of Collateral Network (COLT).\n\nThat being said, Litecoin has been working diligently to stay ahead of the ethereum blockchain and other competition by improving its technology and forging partnerships with prominent players in the industry. These efforts are aimed at bolstering the Litecoin ecosystem and ensuring that it remains an attractive option for investors and users alike and grows market capitalization.\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) Latest Developments Could Solidify its Position\n\nEthereum (ETH) remains a dominant force in the cryptocurrency space, even as new challengers like Litecoin and Collateral Network emerge. Its latest developments, including the ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0, promise increased growth, efficiency, and security, which could potentially solidify its position as the leading platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is not without its challenges. High gas fees and network congestion issues have led some users to seek out alternatives like Litecoin and the promising Collateral Network. In response, the Ethereum network is working tirelessly to address these issues and maintain its largest cryptocurrency market dominance.\n\nFailure to address these issues could lead to a decrease in market share and a loss of popularity. Therefore, it is important for Ethereum to continue innovating and responding to the needs of its users in order to maintain its relevance and keep competitors like Litecoin (LTC) and Collateral Network (COLT) at bay. For those looking to invest in the future of Ethereum, now is the time to purchase COLT tokens before they become too expensive.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT): a Disruptive Lending Project\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is an avant-garde decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aspires to transform the lending industry. With its on-chain approach using smart contracts, the platform enables users to borrow cryptocurrency against their physical assets without intermediaries or cumbersome paperwork. This is the first and only lending protocol currently on the blockchain that is bringing off-chain assets onto the blockchain to utilize them in this manner.\n\nThese assets are then tokenized into tangible NFTs and then fractionalized. Lenders on the platform can then mint portions of the NFTs to provide funding for the borrower\u2019s loan and get paid an agreed interest for doing so. This unique approach to asset-backed lending has generated a lot of excitement in the industry, prompting several crypto investors and blockchain enthusiasts to invest heavily in the platform.\n\nThe native token of Collateral Network is $COLT, and this token has dual tokenomics features. It serves as a governance token that gives holders the right to vote and participate in important decisions and updates regarding the network. Also, it is a utility token that will be used to perform transactions on the platform.\n\nCOLT is currently in stage 1 of its presale, and over 125 million tokens have already been sold. The price of COLT has been projected to increase by 3500% during its presale, reaching a price of $0.35. With these projections, industry experts have said now is the best time to buy into the Collateral Network ecosystem.\n\nFor more information on Collateral Network visit the website, join the presale or join the community for regular updates.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
