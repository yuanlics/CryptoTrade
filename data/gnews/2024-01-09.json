ETH consolidating and still facing many hurdles near $2,350 and $2,400.\n\nEthereum is attempting a fresh increase above the $2,300 resistance level.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,245 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could gain bullish momentum if there is a close above the $2,350 level.\n\nEthereum Price Regains Strength\n\nEthereum price extended its decline below the $2,200 level. However, ETH remained stable near the $2,180 and $2,170 levels. A low was formed near $2,170 and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a decent increase above the $2,240 level. There was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,245 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair climbed above the $2,320 resistance, but the bears were active near $2,350.\n\nA high was formed near $2,358 and the price is now correcting gains.

Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,800 zone.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,350 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,280 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,260 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,170 swing low to the $2,358 high. A downside break and a close below $2,260 might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,170 support.

        "content": "A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here.\n\nGM, Tim here.\n\nHere\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently:\n\nEthereum layer 2 activity is surging. But are the rollups ready for it?\n\nProjects pick Celestia stakers for token airdrops\n\nDeFi security may not be ready for another bull run\n\nHow decentralised are layer 2s?\n\nDeFi users are piling into layer 2 blockchains, pushing several metrics to new highs.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nArbitrum, the biggest layer 2 by total value locked, surpassed the Ethereum mainnet in decentralised exchange transaction volume. At the same time, the combined TVL of all layer 2s registered a fresh all-time high of over $20 billion.\n\nEven smaller layer 2s like Metis are benefitting from the excitement surrounding Ethereum\u2019s scaling options.\n\nEthereum\u2019s faithful cheer the increased adoption of layer 2s, which are faster and cheaper than the main Ethereum network they rely on to finalise transactions.\n\nBut there\u2019s an elephant in the room: most layer 2s are still nowhere near as decentralised as they would like to be.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nUsers must trust that transactions are verified correctly by a centralised entity \u2014 usually the company building the layer 2 \u2014 instead of through a decentralised consensus like the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThis is a problem because it goes against DeFi\u2019s founding principle of not having to rely on or trust any single entity to transact.\n\nFor the average DeFi degen, whether or not a specific layer 2 is decentralised probably doesn\u2019t matter that much.\n\nBut for more sophisticated investors \u2014 such as institutions \u2014 having to trust the companies behind layer 2s will make some think twice before committing serious cash to them.\n\nThe first layer 2 to fully decentralise its transaction processing should benefit greatly \u2014 and I expect at least one to make it happen in 2024.\n\nA new airdrop trend emerges\n\nCelestia stakers had a great start to 2024: two projects have promised them airdrops of valuable tokens, with another strongly hinting at the prospect.\n\nSo why are these projects being so generous?\n\nIn a nutshell, because they rely on the Celestia blockchain for their transaction validation, and those who stake their Celestia tokens are pivotal to that.\n\nIf the projects running on Celestia can incentivise more people to stake Celestia tokens, the more secure they are.\n\nIt\u2019s likely this new trend of airdropping tokens to Celestia stakers is only just beginning. More projects building on Celestia \u2014 such as Berachain, Monad, and Kinto \u2014 are also set to launch later this year.\n\nCertiK calls out DeFi security \u2014 then gets hacked itself\n\nCrypto security firm CertiK warns the brewing bull run will be a key test for the DeFi sector in a new report.\n\nCertiK said the DeFi industry needs to decrease the correlation between the money deposited into it and the total amount lost in hacks and scams, if it wants to be taken seriously.\n\nWhile CertiK makes a valid point, a security breach in its own house dampened its effect.\n\nJust two days after publishing the report, CertiK\u2019s X account was compromised following an employee\u2019s interaction with a scammer posing as a representative from a media organisation.\n\nThe breached CertiK account disseminated a message to the security firm\u2019s 343,000 followers, claiming a vulnerability in the decentralised exchange Uniswap\u2019s router contract and linking to a phishing site.\n\nAfter a year of mishaps for CertiK, where the firm signed off on multiple projects that went on to get hacked or rug pull depositors, 2024 isn\u2019t off to a great start.\n\nData of the week\n\nL2Beat provides a nifty dashboard that keeps track of how decentralised each Ethereum layer 2 is.\n\nWhen it comes to general-purpose layer 2s, Arbitrum is the furthest along, but it has yet to make validation permissionless.\n\nL2Beat keeps track of what stage of decentralisation each Ethereum layer 2 is at. (L2Beat)\n\nThis week in DeFi governance\n\nVOTE: Establish the Arbitrum DAO procurement committee\n\nTEMP CHECK VOTE: Add PayPal\u2019s PYUSD to the Aave v3 Ethereum market\n\nPROPOSAL: Make Celestia liquid staking safer and more aligned with the blockchain\n\nPost of the week\n\nWe couldn\u2019t pass up on the opportunity to highlight some rare praise for DefiLlama from one of crypto\u2019s most notorious pseudonymous voices: Gwart.\n\nWhile Gwart\u2019s posts are usually heavily sarcastic, we\u2019re hoping this one is sincere!\n\nI will say something nice here: the most useful thing in DeFi is DefiLlama \u2014 Gwart (@GwartyGwart) January 8, 2024\n\nWhat we\u2019re watching\n\nAnd now $3,000,000,000 of leveraged stETH on Aave that was \"very liquid\" is relying on $300mn of Curve liquidity; there is still virtually no off-chain liquidity.\n\n\n\nEspecially with volatility from ETF news, if any large stETH holder gets impatient and sells, things could get ugly https://t.co/jgNhjesvc5 pic.twitter.com/AFL4Di6NBQ \u2014 Riyad Carey (@riyad_carey) January 5, 2024\n\nCelsius\u2019 move to unstake its Ether holdings has clogged the validator exit queue.\n\nSeveral analysts, including Kaiko\u2019s Riyad Carey, have pointed out that such a situation could put liquidity for Lido\u2019s stETH token in a potentially perilous position.\n\nHave you joined our Telegram channel yet?

        "title": "ETHBTC May Capitulate, Will These Factors Support Ethereum? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Despite ETHBTC trending lower in favor of Bitcoin (BTC), there is a chance that the second most valuable cryptocurrency will recover in the months ahead. Taking to X in support of Ethereum (ETH), a crypto analyst, Mckenna, said a favorable combination of protocol-related and regulatory factors may support ETH, plugging the bleed versus BTC and sparking a refreshing rally.\n\nEthereum Under-performing Bitcoin: Will This Continue?\n\nLooking at the ETHBTC weekly chart, it is evident that Bitcoin bulls have had the upper hand since August 2022. During this time, Bitcoin gained 42% versus ETH, with bulls pressing on when writing.\n\nTo illustrate, Bitcoin is at a 2022 low versus ETH and will likely extend gains once a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The crypto community expects this authorization to cement Bitcoin\u2019s position, possibly drawing in billions in capital.\n\nSome analysts argue that this event could support altcoins, including Ethereum. So far, Ethereum, though edging lower versus Bitcoin, is firm against the USD. McKenna also notes that once a spot Bitcoin ETF is live in the United States, attention will shift to the SEC on whether it will also greenlight a similar product, but for Ethereum.\n\nThese 2 Factors Might Support ETH\n\nDespite the ETH weakness versus BTC, Mckenna expects Ethereum to recover in the medium to long term. This is because of the expected preference for proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus systems over proof-of-work (PoW) methods that power Bitcoin.\n\nPoW is a computationally intensive process that uses much energy for block confirmation. This has led to criticism from those who are concerned about the environmental impact of crypto mining. For this reason, Ethereum adopted a PoS system, fully transitioning in 2021 after the Merge.\n\nBeyond the energy efficiency, the analyst also notes that the PoS in Ethereum provides ETH stakers with a base yield that will be considered \u201cthe safest bond instrument in the entire digital asset space.\u201d Subsequently, this may support ETH, with many viewing it as a safe haven. This assurance is based chiefly on the fact that Ethereum is the second most valuable crypto network, with over $276 billion in market cap, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAdditionally, ETH will, in the long run, be deflationary following the activation of EIP-1559 in August 2021. This system burns a portion of gas fees- the base fee- taking a portion of ETH out of circulation. According to Ultra Sound Money, over 17,600 ETH have been destroyed in the last week alone, 1,000 ETH more than those network issues.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

With an astounding 99.95% decrease in energy use, this much-anticipated change has ushered in a new era of sustainability and environmental friendliness in the blockchain sector.\n\nEthereum has displayed decent growth recently. It is trading at $2,296.73 at press time, with a 3.3% surge in value over the last 24 hours. ETH is up by 75% year-to-year. Let us look at the price prediction for Ethereum for mid-January 2024.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum: ETH Could Hit $3500 in Q1, But There\u2019s a Catch\n\nSource: ETH price CoinGecko\n\nEthereum price prediction for mid-January 2024\n\nCryptocurrency experts at Changelly have predicted the price of ETH for mid-January 2024.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s value against Bitcoin has dropped to historical lows as market anticipation grows for an imminent launch of a spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S.\n\nData from Paris-based crypto intelligence platform Kaiko showed that the ETH/BTC ratio has steadily declined since the smart-contract-enabled blockchain transitioned into a proof-of-stake network in September 2022. During the last 24 hours, the metric dropped to 0.048, its lowest point since May 2021.\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio is a crucial measure for gauging Ethereum\u2019s performance in relation to Bitcoin. When this ratio rises, Ethereum gains strength or maintains its value better than Bitcoin, suggesting a market preference for ETH over BTC.\n\nConversely, a decrease in the ETH/BTC ratio indicates Ethereum\u2019s weaker performance compared to Bitcoin, potentially signaling investor leanings toward the perceived safety of Bitcoin.\n\nThis ratio goes beyond mere price movements as it encapsulates shifts in investor confidence and market sentiment between these two prominent cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptoSlate\u2019s data shows that BTC\u2019s price has greatly outperformed Ethereum\u2019s over the past year. During the period, the top cryptocurrency\u2019s price rose by more than 170% to a 21-month high of more than $47,000, while ETH was able to post a modest gain of 74%.\n\nBTC\u2019s positive run could be attributed to the surrounding market optimism and demands for the potential approval of a spot ETF. Over the past several months, several asset managers, including BlackRock, VanEck, Grayscale, and others, have actively engaged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the applications, fueling speculations that these products could begin trading as early as Jan. 11.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s lukewarm price performance came amid the launch of several futures-based ETFs for the digital asset last year. These ETFs barely made a ripple in the market as they saw tepid demand, forcing asset manager CoinShares to describe ETH as the \u201cleast loved altcoin\u201d compared to rivals like Solana."

In a recent tweet, van de Poppe conveyed his insights, indicating that Ethereum was approaching the low of 2022 and was likely to absorb liquidity at that level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe expressed the belief that in the event of a spot ETF approval for Bitcoin (BTC), there would potentially be a liquidation candle on the trading chart for the ETH/BTC trading pair. Following this, analyst van de Poppe foresaw a rotation of funds into Ethereum, accompanied by a bullish weekly divergence.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there.\n\n\n\nIf an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we'll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nAccording to the most recent data, Ethereum is presently valued at $2,294, indicating a noteworthy 3.04% uptick in the past 24 hours. The trading volume within this period has experienced a substantial surge, escalating by 36.14% and peaking at $12.48 billion. In the aftermath of this modest rally, ETH has observed $21.60 million in short liquidations and $11.79 million in long liquidations, as reported by CoinGlass.\n\nSpillover effect\n\nThe focal point of van de Poppe's analysis revolves around the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The cryptocurrency market anticipates a breakthrough, with BlackRock, a financial behemoth, leading the charge. BlackRock, along with other prominent firms such as Grayscale Investments, Valkyrie and ARK 21Shares, has recently submitted updated 19b-4 filings for their proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMarket sentiment is building as BlackRock expresses confidence in the SEC's approval for its spot Bitcoin ETF, with expectations pointing toward a potential decision as early as this Wednesday. A positive outcome could trigger a ripple effect in the broader cryptocurrency market, impacting not only Bitcoin but also potentially leading to a rotation of funds into Ethereum.\n\nMicha\u00ebl Van de Poppe's prediction hinges on the notion that Bitcoin spot ETF approval may prompt a notable uptrend for Ethereum. Traders and investors are closely monitoring these developments, recognizing the interconnected nature of cryptocurrencies and the potential spillover effects of major regulatory decisions. As Ethereum stands at this critical juncture, the market awaits further clarity from regulatory bodies and key players in the cryptocurrency space."

The block reward will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.\n\nRegarding Ethereum, analysts spotlight the forthcoming upgrade named Cancun. Anticipated to enhance scalability and security, the upgrade aims to make layer-2 transactions as cost-effective as possible, potentially leading to a significant increase in the number of processed transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nCoinbase also notes that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have undergone two cycles, encompassing both bull and bear markets, with the ongoing cycle, which initiated in 2022, closely mirrors the patterns observed in the preceding cycles.\n\nRead more: CryptoQuant unveil two potential scenarios for spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "ETH was up by more than 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nMarket indicators and metrics remained bullish on the token.\n\nThe crypto market recently turned bullish, allowing most cryptos to register gains, and Ethereum [ETH] was no exception. Though this sudden uptrend gave investors hope of a sustained bull rally, an analyst had something different to say.\n\nEthereum finally turns bullish\n\nAfter a week-long decline, Ethereum investors were finally enjoying profits as the token\u2019s daily chart turned green.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was up by more than 5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $2,318.33 with a market capitalization of over $278 billion.\n\nHowever, the latest analysis from CryptoQuant suggested that the probability of ETH moving within a small price range seemed likely.\n\nCryptoOnChain, an analyst and author at CryptoQuant, mentioned in an analysis that derivative market charts indicate a relatively high number of short transactions, which looked bearish.\n\nThe analysis also mentioned that it was unlikely for ETH to initiate a bull rally before Bitcoin [BTC] manages to go above a key resistance level of $43,500.\n\nHowever, the king of cryptos has toppled the resistance level already. At press time, BTC was trading at $46,770.41.\n\nTherefore, AMBCrypto planned to have a closer look at ETH\u2019s metrics to understand whether the king of altcoins can touch $2,500 anytime soon.\n\nEthereum\u2019s metrics look bullish\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that buying pressure on the token was high. This was evident from the fact that its net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven-day average.\n\nAnother bullish signal was its active addresses, which increased in the recent past.\n\nBuying sentiment among US investors was also high as its Coinbase premium was green. Not only that, but things in the derivatives market also looked pretty optimistic.\n\nEthereum\u2019s funding rate remained green, meaning that derivatives investors were actively buying ETH at its higher price.\n\nIf ETH manages to sustain its bull rally, as suggested by the aforementioned metrics, the coin might face resistance in quite a few zones.\n\nAnalysis of Ethereum\u2019s liquidation levels revealed that in order to maintain a bull rally, ETH must go above the $2,400 mark and then the $2,450 mark in the near future.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe possibility of ETH going above these levels was likely, as most market indicators were bullish.\n\nFor instance, its Money Flow Index (MFI) registered an uptick. Its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar trend, increasing the chances of a continued uptrend."

        "content": "While Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications are still awaiting approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), executives from asset management firms are already speculating about the potential launch of spot ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies, including XRP and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nValkyrie Invest\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, Steven McClurg, expressed his belief that the SEC\u2019s potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF could pave the way for similar offerings in the XRP and Ethereum markets.\n\nHowever, regulatory challenges and classifying XRP and Ethereum as securities may present hurdles toward these index funds.\n\nXRP And Ethereum Spot ETF Potential Hurdles\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which has been classified as a commodity by regulators, XRP and Ethereum have been deemed securities. This divergence in classification poses potential difficulties and may necessitate a more complex approval process for spot ETFs tracking these cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe anticipated impact of spot ETF approval on the XRP and Ethereum price would mirror the pattern seen with Bitcoin. Still, the SEC\u2019s skepticism towards the broader cryptocurrency market could pose additional hurdles for XRP and Ethereum ETFs.\n\nNevertheless, the outcome of the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC case holds significant implications and could hold the key for the cryptocurrency industry to pursue these index funds for other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf Ripple, the blockchain payment company associated with XRP, emerges victorious and is not classified as a security by Judge Analisa Torres, it could establish a precedent for asset managers seeking to apply for an XRP ETF.\n\nThis legal precedent could also prompt potential litigation against the SEC to support an Ethereum ETF application.\n\nWhile discussions revolve around the possibility of spot ETFs for XRP and Ethereum, there is still uncertainty surrounding the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe SEC may reject or delay the pending applications, making it uncertain whether these other index funds will materialize. Furthermore, US regulators\u2019 current classification of XRP and Ethereum as securities adds an additional layer of complexity to their respective ETF prospects.\n\nBitcoin ETF Decision Imminent\n\nAs reported on Monday by NewsBTC, Sources close to the process have indicated that the ultimate approval for Bitcoin ETFs may come on Wednesday.\n\nCNBC\u2019s sources suggest that this coincides with the application deadline for Ark Invest and 21 Shares, raising the possibility of a potential trading launch between Thursday and Friday. Several applications are expected to receive the green light, pending updates from the SEC on the filings.\n\nOverall, as anticipation builds around the potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs, asset managers are already contemplating the prospect of spot ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies like XRP and Ethereum.\n\nHowever, the regulatory challenges and the classification of XRP and Ethereum as securities present significant hurdles for these index funds. The Ripple vs. SEC case outcome could have far-reaching implications, potentially setting a legal precedent for asset managers to pursue XRP and Ethereum ETFs.\n\nXRP is trading at $0.5673, showing a lack of bullish momentum with a 1% decline in the past 24 hours. Furthermore, it has experienced a continuous downtrend of 13% over the past 30 days.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "So far, Ethereum appears to be showing signs of an impending bullish run, according to Crypto Tony, a renowned analyst in the crypto space. Crypto Tony suggests that Ethereum\u2019s journey to bullish momentum could commence if it successfully maintains its position above the crucial level of $2,130.\n\nFortunately, the asset trades above this price level and appears to be climbing further above it, with its current trading price of $2,264 at the time of writing.\n\nKey Levels For Major ETH Rally\n\nThe $2,130 price mark, as disclosed by Crypto Tony, is seen as a pivotal point for Ethereum, as maintaining this level could signal \u201cstrength and stability,\u201d setting the stage for further gains.\n\nThis optimism further escalates should Ethereum reclaim the range high at $2,500, a price level Crypto Tony revealed that would reinforce the bullish sentiment in the Ethereum market. Notably, Crypto Tony\u2019s bullish outlook aligns with the sentiments of other analysts in the crypto community.\n\n$ETH / $USD \u2013 Update The ETH range is simple. Remain above $2,130 and we are bullish .. Reclaim the range high at $2,500 and we are really bullish pic.twitter.com/YKOph2YbRY \u2014 Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 8, 2024\n\nFor instance, Ali Chart, another notable crypto analyst, has identified $3,830 and $5,100 price levels as Ethereum\u2019s following major targets based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) price bands.\n\nFor context, MVRV is a key on-chain metric or indicator that compares a cryptocurrency\u2019s market value (market cap) to its realized value, offering an alternative approach to assess the network\u2019s valuation by considering the price at which each unit last moved.\n\nThe MVRV ratio is a crucial indicator that can be utilized especially for gauging the relative valuation of a crypto asset like Ethereum. When the MVRV ratio is high, it often suggests that the cryptocurrency\u2019s price may be overvalued, and when it\u2019s low, the asset could be undervalued.\n\nAccording to the #Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands, the next key price targets for $ETH are $3,830 and $5,100! pic.twitter.com/cLo4crWkPF \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) January 1, 2024\n\nAccording to a chart recently shared by Ali Chart on X, Ethereum is currently on an upward trajectory, with the next significant MVRV Pricing Bands at 2.4 and 3.2. These levels indicate that Ethereum may become overvalued, correlating to Ali\u2019s price targets for Ethereum at around $3,830 and $5,100, respectively.\n\nEthereum Whale Movements Backs Bullish Sentiment\n\nAdding to the bullish sentiments are recent whale movements. Spot On Chain has disclosed that an Ethereum whale, identified as \u20180x931\u2019, made a significant purchase of 21,192 ETH, valued at approximately $48 million, at an average price of $2,265.\n\nThis accumulation of ETH is a strong indicator of confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future performance, as the whale has now held roughly 79,500 ETH since January 2023, sitting on an unrealized profit of $36.84 million.\n\nMoreover, last week\u2019s on-chain data from Santiment revealed that Ethereum\u2019s largest private wallets now hold a record 56.25 million ETH, representing 46.8% of the crypto\u2019s total circulating supply. This concentration of ETH in large wallets could be interpreted as a sign of long-term holding strategies among major investors.\n\nAmid these developments, Ethereum has been showing signs of recovery from its recent retracement. Despite a week of decline, the altcoin is beginning to exhibit an upward trajectory, with a near 2% increase in the past 24 hours, trading at around $2,272.\n\nThis recovery is further evidenced by a surge in trading volume, which has surged from a low of $11 billion last Monday to over $20 billion, indicating a possible increasing buying activity.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights With a consolidation range formation below the $2400 mark, ETH price coils up huge trend momentum.\n\nThe recent overnight recovery with high anticipations around the Bitcoin Spot ETF fuels the rally in altcoins in Ethereum.\n\nRising momentum and improving sentiments tease a breakout run in ETH price to $2700.\n\nKeeping a bullish stance in the long consolidation range, the ETH price finds constant support at the bottom base of $2200. Becoming a multi-contact point of reversal, Ethereum price continuously the streak of bullish engulfing formation from the crucial support level.\n\nLasting for more than 30 days, the Ethereum price constantly struggles to enter a decisive trend. Nevertheless, the recent market-wide recovery aligns with our ETH price prediction, which holds a bullish standpoint for the upcoming trend.\n\nBuyers Preparing Breakout Challenges $2400 Barrier.\n\nSource \u2013 TradingView\n\nDespite the recent failure to sustain the New Year\u2019s rally, the ETH price avoids a downfall like other altcoins of lesser market cap. With the strong buying activity at the $2200 support level, the bulls are prolonging the range formation and coiling up more trend momentum.\n\nThe intent is clear to provide a high-speed move upon the fracturing of the boundary on either side. Moreover, the spike in the buying pressure, evidenced by the spike in trading volume supporting the price jumps, improves the breakout chances.\n\nCurrently, the ETH price trades at $2308 and takes a 1.04% intraday pullback following the 4.94% jump last night. As the tradition of $2200 bouncing the Ethereum price continues, the $2400 breakout possibility sustains.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nRSI indicator: The daily RSI line shows a sideways trend, diluting the prevailing downfall near the halfway line. Moreover, the bullish divergence in the past two dips at the $2200 support increases the bull run chances.\n\nMACD Indicator: The MACD and signal lines close up the gap with the recent jump in ETH price and tease a bullish crossover. Further, the recent price jump in Ethereum shows a spike in average lines, reflecting improved sentiment and a potential comeback for Ethereum.\n\nThe Bears Are On The Verge Of Liquidation\n\nFollowing the recent liquidation event of almost $100Mn Liquidation from the bulls, the ETH price stabilizes normally within the range. Further, the recent liquidation chart from Coinglass shows a spike in liquidations on the bearish side.\n\nAs bears lose $42Mn due to liquidation on Monday and the uptrend gaining momentum, the Ethereum price may soon make a strong comeback. This can lead to more bearish liquidations in the coming days.\n\nIs Ethereum Ready to Cross $2400?\n\nAs per the technical analysis, the ETH price action shows a high momentum bullish trend entering a sideways track. Therefore, as per the price pattern analysis, a bullish flag pattern forms in the daily chart. Hence, the breakout of the consolidation range is most likely on the upside as the flag pattern is a trend continuation pattern.\n\nThe recent surge has tested the $2400 level and presented a breakout entry for traders who missed the $220 breakout. Additionally, the likelihood of Ethereum crossing the $2500 level is increasing, with significant upside potential remaining. The uptrend could potentially reach the $2700 level.\n\nConversely, a reversal could drive the price of ETH back to $2200."

As explained these days, I expect the market to pump first. BTC to $48,000-$50,000, ETH to $2,500-$2,600. Alts should pump more, especially low caps. After this, which should take a few days, the market should reach a very important local top. That\u2019s when I will start opening swing short positions, aiming for new lows.\u201d\n\nLooking further out, the trader maintains his long-standing prediction that Bitcoin will eventually collapse to the $12,000 level, which his chart suggests will happen around April.\n\n\u201cBTC HTF (high timeframe) idea.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $46,776 at time of writing, up 7% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading for $2,314 at time of writing, up 4.7% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Fantom co-founder Andre Cronje, known as the godfather of decentralized finance (DeFi), further raised concerns over probabilistic finality in blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum as the market sees expanding use cases and adoption in traditional finance. He said Fantom has already solved state bloat as Ethereum developers look to solve state bloat in the chain.\n\nAndre Cronje Says Fantom Has Resolved S tate Bloat Issue\n\nIn response to Ambient Finance founder Doug Colkitt\u2019s belief that Ethereum is the only chain looking to solve state bloat in its long-term plan, Andre Cronje said \u201cI am pretty confident in saying we already solved state bloat at Fantom.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum roadmap entails using Verkle trees to allow for \u201cdata to be small enough to be attached to every block.\u201d It could help validators and nodes to become stateless as all \u2018state\u2019 can be stored more efficiently off-chain.\n\nHowever, Andre Cronje said any blockchain that uses probabilistic finality or any variant of the longest chain rule won\u2019t resolve this issue. Bitcoin and Ethereum chains depend on probabilistic finality. Finality refers to when a block of transactions is considered permanent and cannot be altered or reversed.\n\nFantom uses aBFT (Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus mechanism, which does not require the longest chain rule.\n\nMoreover, Fantom introduced the new database Carmen, a flat storage method that does not use tree or dictionary structures while maintaining a cryptographic signature of the world state. This greatly reduces the bloat of the current active state (two epochs). Carmen supports real-time pruning, and although archive nodes still need to retain all data, most validators can enable pruning.\n\nAfter adopting the above technology, Fantom\u2019s status is reduced from about 2TB (archive) to 60GB (archive). Cronje said state bloat has been one of Fantom\u2019s core milestones since its early days.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock And VanEck Files Updated S-1 For Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval"

        "content": "Over the past week, a total of 40,000 Ethereum, estimated to be over $90 million, was transferred by Celsius to its significant creditors, Coinbase and FalconX.\n\nAccording to Arkham Intelligence, Celsius still retains a substantial amount of Ethereum in its Staked ETH account, amounting to approximately 59,000 ETH, valued at over $133 million. The bankrupt lender\u2019s recent activity is a strategic maneuver to unlock a considerable portion of its Ethereum holdings. This decision is part of a comprehensive plan designed to facilitate the allocation of assets to the firm\u2019s creditors, a major step in its bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nCelsius will unstake existing ETH holdings, which have provided valuable staking rewards income to the estate, to offset certain costs incurred throughout the restructuring process \u2014 Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) January 4, 2024\n\nYou might also like: Celsius moves to unstake $470m in ETH for creditor repayments\n\nHaving filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022, Celcius grappled with a severe liquidity crisis, exacerbated by the downturn in the cryptocurrency market following the UST crash and FTX\u2019s collapse. The decision to unstack Ethereum will potentially generate the liquidity needed to navigate the costs associated with the restructuring process and ensure that creditors receive their dues on time.\n\nOn Boxing Day, the court approved Celsius Network and its associated unsecured creditors to proceed with the \u201cMiningCo Transaction.\u201d This decision, documented in court filings, allows Celsius to move forward with a specific part of its restructuring plan.\n\nDespite objections from the United States Trustee, a group of borrowers, and individual creditors like Cathy Lau and Anne Yeilding, the court ultimately sanctioned Celsius\u2019s plan. This approval, along with the company\u2019s recent ETH unstaking efforts, is a significant step in its ongoing efforts to manage its bankruptcy and restructure its operations.\n\nRead more: Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers file new AP disclosures with SEC\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF being launched in the US has the crypto community buzzing, with some analysts speculating that these funds could be approved as early as this week.\n\nWe tasked the AI model ChatGPT with providing an in-depth price prediction for Ethereum (ETH) if one of these ETFs was given the green light.\n\nChatGPT also highlighted a new altcoin, Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), that could be primed to benefit from the tailwinds associated with ETF approval.\n\nHow Could Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Affect Ethereum\u2019s Price?\n\nWhile Ethereum and Bitcoin are separate blockchains with different use cases, the two leading cryptos have often moved in tandem in the market and look likely to continue doing so.\n\nThe reasons are multifaceted \u2013 for one, regulatory approval of a spot BTC ETF could mean greater legitimacy for cryptocurrencies as an asset class.\n\nIn turn, this may inspire investor confidence in altcoins like Ethereum.\n\nAdditionally, launching a successful BTC ETF may increase the appetite for a spot ETH ETF down the line, which would likely boost the ETH price in anticipation.\n\nHowever, some analysts caution that the actual debut of a spot BTC ETF could be underwhelming relative to expectations.\n\nThis might start a wave of profit-taking that spills over into Ethereum and other altcoins.\n\nStill, the overall consensus suggests a spot ETF would introduce new institutional inflows, outweighing any short-term volatility.\n\nFor this reason, Ethereum investors are eagerly anticipating the potential launch of one of these funds in the US.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s Bullish ETH Price Prediction If SEC Gives Spot ETF Green Light\n\nMoving from market speculation to AI-generated projections, we consulted ChatGPT to analyze how the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF could impact Ethereum\u2019s price outlook.\n\nWith ETH currently trading around $2,270, ChatGPT delivered an overwhelmingly bullish forecast.\n\nThe AI model argues ETF approval would accelerate crypto asset adoption, attract institutional dollars, and create a halo effect, boosting the broader altcoin market \u2013 all positive for Ethereum.\n\nConsidering these factors and Ethereum\u2019s independent growth drivers within the DeFi space, ChatGPT sees significant upside potential even after the recent rally.\n\nIn the model\u2019s most optimistic scenario, if a spot BTC ETF gets the green light, ChatGPT predicts ETH could reach between $3,000 and $4,000 by the end of the year.\n\nThis would represent a rally of up to 76% from current levels.\n\nWhile this forecast is entirely hypothetical, ChatGPT makes a strong case for ETH benefiting from a regulatory breakthrough on the Bitcoin front.\n\nWhich Other Coins Could Rise After Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval?\n\nWhile all the attention is being given to Bitcoin and Ethereum, a spot BTC ETF could open the floodgates for capital into smaller-cap tokens.\n\nOne under-the-radar project on the verge of a significant breakthrough is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), an innovative Stake-to-Mine platform in its presale phase.\n\nChatGPT Predicts 687% Price Pump for Bitcoin Minetrix as Presale Nears $8M Milestone\n\nAs a crypto project striving to open Bitcoin mining to mainstream investors, Bitcoin Minetrix is well-positioned to ride the wave of interest from spot BTC ETF approval.\n\nThe project\u2019s novel \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d model lets users earn BTC rewards by staking BTCMTX tokens rather than running expensive mining hardware.\n\nThis feature has already helped raise over $7.9 million in presale funding, showcasing strong investor interest.\n\nWe asked ChatGPT how BTC ETF approval could impact Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s price outlook in 2024.\n\nThe AI model cited several bullish factors, including increased crypto legitimacy, which would translate into potential tailwinds for mining tokens like BTCMTX.\n\nConsidering these factors, ChatGPT forecasts that BTCMTX\u2019s price could rise as high as $0.10 if the token is listed on exchanges following spot ETF approval.\n\nShould ChatGPT\u2019s prediction come true, it would represent a staggering 687% increase from the current presale price of $0.0127.\n\nWith anticipation ramping up in the Bitcoin Minetrix Telegram group, ChatGPT\u2019s bullish forecast could fuel further enthusiasm and attract more attention to the project.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale"

Buy Ethereum With PayPal on Skilling\n\nSkilling leads the way when it comes to trading contracts for difference (CFDs). There is a wide array of crypto CFDs available on the platform for you to trade once you\u2019ve made a PayPal deposit.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum With PayPal on Skilling\n\n1. Create a free account\n\nIn the top right corner of the website, click on the \u201cSign up\u201d button. You will need to provide your email address, password, and country. Then, you can click \u201cSign up\u201d to create an account.\n\n2. Verify your identity\n\nTo verify your identity, you\u2019ll need to fill in your phone number, tax number, employment information, and answer questions about your trading experience. You will also need to submit a photo ID and some form of proof of address, like a utility bill.\n\n3. Make a deposit with PayPal\n\nIn your account settings, click on \u201cDeposit\u201d. The payment options available in your country will be shown at the top, and you can scroll along until you find PayPal. Fill in the amount, click \u201cDeposit\u201d, and follow the instructions to complete your payment.\n\n4. Start trading Ethereum\n\nGo to the crypto section of the platform and use the search box to find Ethereum. Simply fill in how much you wish to purchase and click on the \u201cBuy\u201d button.\n\nWhy Use Skilling?\n\nThe benefit of trading Ethereum CFDs is that they enable you to profit from crypto price changes without actually owning any coins\u2014so you don\u2019t need to worry about storage or security. CFDs are high risk, however, so should only be traded by experienced traders, as there is the potential for significant losses.\n\nUsers can take comfort from the fact that the platform is secure and regulated, while there is a customer support team on hand to provide assistance over the phone, email, or live chat. Skilling offers up to 50x leverage on Ethereum, and also facilitates the trading of other asset types, including shares, commodities, forex, and indices.\n\nYou can choose the trading platform that best suits your experience and needs. Beginners will find the Skilling Trader platform ideal as its intuitive interface is user-friendly. Meanwhile, advanced traders may prefer the cTrader platform, where they can access algorithmic trading and technical indicators.\n\nThe minimum PayPal deposit is $100, and money can be deposited instantly for free. The trading fees start from 0.1% plus spread, but Ethereum CFDs aren\u2019t available to users in the UK. Read our Skilling review.\n\nBuy Ethereum with PayPal on Skilling 82% of retail CFD accounts lose money.\n\n5. Buy Ethereum Directly on PayPal\n\nThe PayPal platform introduced support for a few of the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2021, aiming to make crypto accessible to anyone with a PayPal account.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum on PayPal Directly\n\n1. Create a free account\n\nClick the \u201cSign Up\u201d button and choose \u201cPersonal Account\u201d, if you don\u2019t have a PayPal account already. Fill in your email address, name, and password, and click \u201cContinue\u201d. You will then need to complete your profile with your address, phone number, and date of birth, after which you can link a card and/or bank account to your PayPal account.\n\n2. Confirm your US taxpayer status\n\nYou will be asked to confirm whether or not you are a US citizen before you can purchase any crypto. You will then need to tick a box to confirm that you understand the risks of buying cryptocurrency.\n\n3. Verify your identity\n\nIf you attempt to buy crypto, you will be prompted to verify your identity first. After clicking the \u201cGet Started\u201d button, you will need to fill in a few personal details, and then select your ID type and submit an image of it.\n\n4. Buy Ethereum\n\nClick on Ethereum in the crypto section and tap the \u201cBuy\u201d button. After entering how much you want to buy, click \u201cNext\u201d and select your funding source. Review the transaction and fees, and then click \u201cAgree and Buy\u201d.\n\nWhy Use PayPal?\n\nPayPal provides a quick and easy way to purchase ETH and other popular cryptocurrencies, especially for those who are new to crypto and don\u2019t yet have the skills to trade on a crypto exchange or broker.\n\nIt allows you to gain exposure to crypto without needing to risk a lot of capital, as the minimum purchase amount is just \u00a31. There are also some educational resources on the platform if you want to expand your crypto knowledge.\n\nOnly Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash are available to buy directly on PayPal, so more experienced crypto users may be disappointed by the limited choice, as well as the lack of trading tools.\n\nPayPal charges a fee of at least 1.5% plus spread on ETH purchases and sales. When buying smaller amounts, however, the fee can be much higher. If you want to withdraw your crypto to a private wallet, you can do so if you pay a network fee.\n\nPros\n\nVery easy to use\n\nDon\u2019t need an account with a crypto exchange/broker\n\nMinimum purchase of \u00a31\n\nSome educational resources\n\nCons"

        "content": "Ethereum, after a brief dip in Monday's trading session, has shown signs of resurgence, breaking above the 20-day Exponential Moving Average.\n\nThe momentum suggests a potential target of around $2,400. This level has repeatedly resisted price advances and represents a significant point of interest.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Bitcoin remains the primary driver in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe $2,400 level is expected to continue offering resistance. Should a breakthrough occur, the market might make a concerted effort to surpass the $2,500 level, which also holds considerable attention and resistance. Beyond that, the $2,750 level becomes the next potential target. Over the longer term, there is a possibility of ascending even further, with a measured move from the previous ascending triangle indicating a potential destination of $3,400 or potentially higher.\n\nConsolidation Phase\n\nIn the recent trading session, the market has been in a consolidation phase, accumulating momentum for an upward push. The $2,100 level is considered reliable support, complemented by the presence of the 50-day EMA in the same vicinity. These elements align to create a setup that suggests an impending upward move. Additionally, if there is an expectation of central banks adopting loose monetary policies, it could benefit Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. Monitoring the 10-year yield is crucial in this context. A decline below the $2,000 level would necessitate a reassessment of the entire market. However, for now, the prevailing sentiment leans towards buying opportunities during dips.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nIn the end, Ethereum has displayed renewed strength, breaking above the 20-day EMA and potentially targeting the $2,400 level. Resistance is expected at this juncture, with subsequent targets at $2,500 and $2,750. A longer-term perspective suggests the possibility of reaching $3,400 or even higher. The market has been consolidating recently, with support at $2,100 and the 50-day EMA reinforcing this zone. The prospect of looser central bank policies could further boost Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. Keeping an eye on the 10-year yield is essential. A drop below $2,000 would necessitate a reevaluation, but for now, buying the dips appears to be the prevailing strategy employed by most traders around the world. The market continues to see plenty of opportunities for people to take advantage of now.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD? Here\u2019s a list of some of the best crypto brokers to check out."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Rally Hiatus Eyes Fresh Liquidity With Spot BTC ETF Approaching - CoinGape",
        "content": "As the window for spot Bitcoin ETF approval shrinks to 36 hours, market participants exhibit contrasting strategies. Bulls favor a breakout in Bitcoin and Ethereum price, while bears anticipate a correction triggered by the \u201csell-the-news\u201d narrative, potentially preceding a longer-term upward trend.\n\nEthereum Price Trend Continuation Depends On Critical Support Levels\n\nAlthough buoyant, Ethereum price stalled close to the stubborn $2,400 resistance. The leading smart contracts token has since early December consolidated within a narrow range, with resistance cut out at $2,400 and support around $2,200.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt is this consolidation that has led to ETH forming a bullish rectangle pattern which if validated may treat investors to a 10% move. Therefore, the next sessions could determine the next direction Ether takes.\n\nSimilarly, if the immediate support highlighted at $2,274 by the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in blue) remains intact, the least resistance would shift upwards, paving the way for Ethereum price to activate the rectangle breakout targeting highs at $2,600. It would be worth looking out for a daily candle close above this support line likely to reinforce the bulls\u2019 presence in the market.\n\nRecommended for you: Crypto Price Prediction For January 9: HNT, BONK, TIA\n\nLong-term success in a news-sensitive market necessitates a measured approach. While experienced investors navigate this volatility with practiced caution, novice traders might find it particularly challenging.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, although donning a sell signal, has the potential to send a call to buy ETH in the near term.\n\nBefore entering new long orders, traders must make sure that the MACD line in blue is above the signal line in red and accompanied by an upward-slopping movement.\n\nPrudence remains paramount even amidst bullish murmurs. As Ethereum price continues to lack directional momentum, a breach below the 20-day EMA (purple) support would lend credence to the prevailing bearish sentiment. This, coupled with the potential market response to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, could intensify downward pressure on Ethereum, potentially pushing it towards the $2,200 rectangle support level.\n\nCollecting liquidity from this support could mean that Ethereum price gains momentum to make another approach for a breakout to $2,600. However, if the support weakens amid increasing panic-selling pressure, ETH may be forced to retest $2,200 and perhaps brush the 200-day EMA (purple) support before the next significant trend reversal starts to build.\n\nThe token is also approaching the 2022 low on the ETH/BTC pair, which crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe believes holds immense liquidity to support the next breakout above $3,000.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there. If an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we'll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nThe anticipation for the ETF would greatly impact the performance of Ethereum price. While a sell-the-news scenario is possible, investors cannot ignore the spike in capital flow likely to give cryptos like ETH and BTC momentum to hit higher highs.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Wallet drainers have now started targeting Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Tron (TRX) communities to execute phishing scams. Earlier, they focused on conducting crypto scams via EVM chains. However, the trend has changed after they expanded their reach into well-established crypto groups.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Scam: Trading Platform Coinspaid Might be the Latest Victim\n\nadvertisement\n\nOverview of Wallet Drainers\u2019 Airdrop Scam\n\nAccording to a post by Scam Sniffer on X, phishing scams have been initiated by attracting crypto enthusiasts via fake airdrops. They have designed a webpage wherein one can claim Ethereum, Solana, and Tron airdrop rewards.\n\nThe scammers term the airdrop scam as an \u201cexclusive opportunity\u201d for the community. Moreover, they encourage people to connect their primary wallet to be able to access these airdrops. In addition, Scam Sniffer noted that these fraudsters can drain various types of crypto wallets via this webpage.\n\nThis update is an alarming one considering the popularity of Ethereum, the second-largest crypto, Solana, and Tron. It could instill crypto investors into believing such wallet drainers in anticipation of high-end crypto rewards. Thereby, millions and billions of digital asset investments could be wiped off owing to such wallet drainer scams.\n\nHowever, it is possible to identify such scams via a few checks. The snapshot shared by Scam Sniffer shows that the concerned airdrop scam webpage has grammatical errors, which could be a way to be safe from such fraudsters. But, they can upgrade their strategies from time to time.\n\nHence, it\u2019s always better to check the source of such links. If a trusted entity isn\u2019t posting such airdrop updates, then avoid such offerings completely. Moreover, it\u2019s time to be even more cautious since hackers have been hacking reputed companies\u2019 X (formerly Twitter) accounts to promote crypto scams.\n\nCertik and Mandiant Official X Accounts Get Hacked\n\nEarlier this month, Certik, a blockchain audit firm, witnessed its X account being hacked. Thereafter, malicious links were posted that promised people to return the digital assets they lost to various crypto scams. The dubious link was available on their website for quite sometime before the Certik team managed to regain access.\n\nThe X account of Mandiant, a cybersecurity company, was successfully reclaimed by its rightful owner on January 4, 2024, after falling victim to hacking. The incident unfolded over several hours on X, with users presenting evidence of the account takeover. The attackers, posing as the Phantom, a non-custodial crypto wallet, used the compromised Mandiant X account to promote a cryptocurrency scam.\n\nAlso Read: Just In: Founder of ACE Crypto Exchange Arrested for Fraud"
