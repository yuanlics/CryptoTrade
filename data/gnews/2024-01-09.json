        "title": "Ethereum Price Avoids Trend Reversal But Key Hurdle Still Intact - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum price managed to stay above $2,170 and recovered losses. ETH consolidating and still facing many hurdles near $2,350 and $2,400.\n\nEthereum is attempting a fresh increase above the $2,300 resistance level.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,245 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could gain bullish momentum if there is a close above the $2,350 level.\n\nEthereum Price Regains Strength\n\nEthereum price extended its decline below the $2,200 level. However, ETH remained stable near the $2,180 and $2,170 levels. A low was formed near $2,170 and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a decent increase above the $2,240 level. There was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,245 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair climbed above the $2,320 resistance, but the bears were active near $2,350.\n\nA high was formed near $2,358 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a minor decline below the $2,320 level. The price moved below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,170 swing low to the $2,358 high.\n\nETH is now trading above $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $2,350 level. The next major resistance is now near $2,400.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe main uptrend hurdle sits at $2,450. A close above the $2,450 resistance could start a decent upward move. The next key resistance is near $2,540. If the bulls push Ethereum above $2,540, there could be a rally toward $2,720. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,800 zone.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,350 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,280 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,260 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,170 swing low to the $2,358 high. A downside break and a close below $2,260 might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,170 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,050 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,260\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,350\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "ETHBTC May Capitulate, Will These Factors Support Ethereum? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Despite ETHBTC trending lower in favor of Bitcoin (BTC), there is a chance that the second most valuable cryptocurrency will recover in the months ahead. Taking to X in support of Ethereum (ETH), a crypto analyst, Mckenna, said a favorable combination of protocol-related and regulatory factors may support ETH, plugging the bleed versus BTC and sparking a refreshing rally.\n\nEthereum Under-performing Bitcoin: Will This Continue?\n\nLooking at the ETHBTC weekly chart, it is evident that Bitcoin bulls have had the upper hand since August 2022. During this time, Bitcoin gained 42% versus ETH, with bulls pressing on when writing.\n\nTo illustrate, Bitcoin is at a 2022 low versus ETH and will likely extend gains once a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The crypto community expects this authorization to cement Bitcoin\u2019s position, possibly drawing in billions in capital.\n\nSome analysts argue that this event could support altcoins, including Ethereum. So far, Ethereum, though edging lower versus Bitcoin, is firm against the USD. McKenna also notes that once a spot Bitcoin ETF is live in the United States, attention will shift to the SEC on whether it will also greenlight a similar product, but for Ethereum.\n\nThese 2 Factors Might Support ETH\n\nDespite the ETH weakness versus BTC, Mckenna expects Ethereum to recover in the medium to long term. This is because of the expected preference for proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus systems over proof-of-work (PoW) methods that power Bitcoin.\n\nPoW is a computationally intensive process that uses much energy for block confirmation. This has led to criticism from those who are concerned about the environmental impact of crypto mining. For this reason, Ethereum adopted a PoS system, fully transitioning in 2021 after the Merge.\n\nBeyond the energy efficiency, the analyst also notes that the PoS in Ethereum provides ETH stakers with a base yield that will be considered \u201cthe safest bond instrument in the entire digital asset space.\u201d Subsequently, this may support ETH, with many viewing it as a safe haven. This assurance is based chiefly on the fact that Ethereum is the second most valuable crypto network, with over $276 billion in market cap, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAdditionally, ETH will, in the long run, be deflationary following the activation of EIP-1559 in August 2021. This system burns a portion of gas fees- the base fee- taking a portion of ETH out of circulation. According to Ultra Sound Money, over 17,600 ETH have been destroyed in the last week alone, 1,000 ETH more than those network issues.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "During Tuesday\u2019s trading session, major cryptocurrencies experienced significant fluctuations due to a false social media post by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF).\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD -1.34% $45,833 Ethereum ETH/USD +2.90% $2,374 Dogecoin DOGE/USD +0.24% $0.080\n\nWhat Happened: Bitcoin reached a new 19-month high of $47,900 after the official SEC account\u2019s tweet about the Bitcoin ETF approval. However, the excitement was short-lived as Bitcoin swiftly dropped almost 6.05% to a low of $45,000. It was later revealed that the SEC\u2019s account had been compromised, and SEC Chair Gary Gensler denied the news.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, wild price fluctuations led to the liquidation of over $214 million in derivatives trading positions on crypto exchanges, according to CoinGlass data.\n\nLiquidations occur when an exchange forcibly closes a trader\u2019s open position using borrowed funds due to a loss of margin.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Helium HNT/USD +27.99% $6.80 Bonk BONK/USD +27.89% $0.00001522 Lido DAO LDO/USD +20.42% $3.74\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.72 trillion, showing a spike of 5.29% in the past 24 hours.\n\n\n\nThe S&P 500 recovered from an earlier decline on Tuesday, primarily driven by gains in the tech sector, but still closed the day with slight losses. Additionally, the Nasdaq Composite rebounded from a nearly 0.9% slide and managed to secure a modest gain of 0.09%, ending the day at 14,857.71.\n\nLooking ahead, investors will focus on two crucial inflation reports to gain insights into the potential future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The December consumer price index is scheduled for release on Thursday, followed by the producer price index on Friday.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe said that there is false information circulating regarding the approval of the Bitcoin ETF for the third time, supposedly stemming from a hack on the SEC account.\n\n\"Theory remains, upside relatively skewed, might reach $51K and then the rotation towards $ETH happens. Atleast $48K touched and Ethereum is taking of.\"\n\nAccording to pseudonymous trader Capo, the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF this week is expected to trigger a brief surge in the value of Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\n\"Whales are showing strong interest in the $48,000-$50,000 level. News can trigger volatility and leave large wicks. So a pump to that level and a big rejection afterward is a likely scenario.\"\n\nOn-chain analyst Ali Martinez has noted that the TD Sequential is flashing a sell signal on the BTC weekly chart. Although not explicitly connecting the upcoming Bitcoin ETF decision to a \u2018sell the news\u2019 event. TD Sequential is a technical analysis indicator used to identify potential price exhaustion and trend reversals.\n\nPhoto by FellowNeko on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"
