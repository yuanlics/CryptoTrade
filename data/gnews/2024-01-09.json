Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2, has surpassed the Ethereum mainnet in decentralized exchange transaction volume, but it's still not fully decentralized. Other layer 2s like Metis are also benefiting from the excitement surrounding Ethereum's scaling options. However, users must trust that transactions are verified correctly by a centralized entity, which goes against DeFi's principles. Two projects are offering airdrops of valuable tokens to Celestia stakers, and more projects are set to launch later this year. CertiK, a crypto security firm, warns that the DeFi industry needs to decrease the correlation between money deposited and total amount lost in hacks and scams. However, CertiK itself got hacked two days after publishing a report on DeFi security."

The analyst highlights two factors that could support ETH: the adoption of a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus system, which is more energy-efficient and provides a base yield for stakers, and the deflationary nature of ETH due to the activation of EIP-1559, which burns a portion of gas fees and takes ETH out of circulation. Despite ETH's weakness versus BTC, the analyst expects ETH to recover in the months ahead."

This indicates a market preference for Bitcoin over Ethereum, potentially due to investor leanings towards the perceived safety of Bitcoin. BTC's price has outperformed ETH's over the past year, with a 170% gain vs ETH's 74% gain. The recent drop in Ethereum's value may be attributed to the lukewarm demand for Ethereum-based futures ETFs launched last year, while the potential approval of a spot ETF for Bitcoin has fueled market optimism and demands for the asset."
