        "summary": "  The article from CoinDesk reports that the hype surrounding Bitcoin ETFs has driven the price of Ethereum to a 32-month low versus Bitcoin. Despite a 10% increase in Ethereum's price since last year, the total value locked across all Ethereum protocols is now less than it was in April of last year. This suggests that Ethereum has fallen out of favor with investors, who are instead focusing on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with potential ETFs."

Despite the recent recovery, ETH is still facing significant hurdles near $2,350 and $2,400, which could limit its upside potential. The main uptrend hurdle is at $2,450, and a close above this level could lead to a decent upward move towards $2,540 and possibly $2,720. However, if ETH fails to clear the $2,350 resistance, it could start a fresh decline towards $2,280 and potentially lower levels.\n\nThe technical indicators, such as MACD and RSI, are losing momentum in the bullish zone, which could be a sign of a potential reversal in the short-term. The major support levels are at $2,260, and a downside break below this level could send ETH towards $2,170 and potentially lower.\n\nIn summary, while ETH has managed to avoid a trend reversal, it is still facing significant hurdles in the short-term, and a potential decl"

According to the analysis, ETH is eyeing a fresh high above $2,500, with the price currently trading above $2,300.

According to Kaiko data, the ETH/BTC ratio has steadily declined since Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake network in September 2022, with a significant drop in the last 24 hours to 0.048, its lowest point since May 2021. This suggests that investors are leaning towards the perceived safety of Bitcoin, rather than Ethereum.\n\nOver the past year, Bitcoin's price has greatly outperformed Ethereum's, with a gain of over 170% compared to Ethereum's modest gain of 74%. This could be attributed to market optimism and demands for the potential approval of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US.

In the last 24 hours, ETH has increased by over 5%, with its market capitalization reaching over $278 billion. However, an analyst from CryptoQuant suggests that the probability of ETH moving within a small price range is likely, due to a high number of short transactions. Despite this, ETH's metrics look bullish, with high buying pressure, increasing active addresses, and a green Coinbase premium among US investors. The funding rate in the derivatives market remains green, indicating that investors are actively buying ETH at its higher price. The article concludes that if ETH can sustain its bull rally, it may face resistance in the $2,400 and $2,450 zones, but the possibility of it going above these levels is likely due to the bullish trend in most market indicators, including the MFI and CMF."
