If the drop continues to that mark, the accumulated energy may be enough for a decline to the $1,800-$1,820 zone.\n\nSuch a scenario is relevant until the end of the month.\n\nImage by TradingView\n\nFrom the midterm point of view, the rate of Ethereum (ETH) keeps trading sideways, getting strength for a further move. As neither side has seized the initiative yet, ongoing consolidation in the range of $1,800-$1,900 is the more likely scenario.\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,873 at press time."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst says a major sell-off event is on the horizon for altcoins, but notes that leading smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) may be safe.\n\nIn a new strategy session, DataDash host Nicholas Merten tells his 511,000 YouTube subscribers that altcoins look primed for a sustained corrective move.\n\n\u201cNot only are altcoins at the moment looking like they\u2019re ready for a continued pullback, we\u2019re doing our due diligence, we\u2019re trying to find the projects we\u2019re interested in but at the same time, I\u2019m going to be honest with you guys, I do see the market continuing to correct.\u201d\n\nLooking at Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of crypto exchange Binance and currently the fifth-ranked digital asset, Merten says its price action could reveal what\u2019s next for the altcoin market at large.\n\nAccording to the crypto trader, BNB could witness a deep correction if it fails to hold the $30 billion level in terms of market cap.\n\n\u201cWe are basically trying to determine now that Binance [Coin], or BNB, has broken through this long-term trend line that it held since 2017, how low can things go? Can it hold here at around $30 billion? Because if it can\u2019t, if it breaks through that level, we are entering into no man\u2019s land.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, the market cap of BNB is $37.6 billion.\n\nAlthough Merten is cautious on altcoins, he says that Ethereum could swim against the tide.\n\n\u201cOut of all the cryptocurrencies out there, one that has stood out that looks at least more bullish to me is the price pattern of Ethereum. Over the last more than a year, it has been building an ascending triangle. This is a bullish pattern where you have a flat range of resistance, ascending lows that line up, squeezing and coiling in price, usually to bounce to the upside.\n\nHowever, I want to make it clear that there\u2019s no guarantee of that as with all technical patterns, we\u2019re just simply working with what we have.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,883 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

As a result of the breach, users of the services encountered difficulties in withdrawing their cryptocurrencies, further exacerbating the situation.\n\nIn an official statement, HypeDrop acknowledged the hack and informed its users that their provider is actively working to address the issues arising from the breach.\n\nNotably, they are currently experiencing difficulties with BTC, ETH, and TRX withdrawals, as well as deposits for ETH and TRX.\n\nOur provider is currently working to solve some recent issues from their side, they are facing problems specifically related to withdrawals of BTC, ETH, and TRX, as well as deposits for ETH and TRX.\n\n\n\nWe are actively monitoring the situation with them and will provide you with an\u2026 \u2014 HypeDrop (@HypeDrop) July 22, 2023\n\nTo assist in resolving the incident, ZachXBT has identified the wallet addresses linked to the $23 million hack. However, the extent of the Bitcoin theft remains unclear as the investigation continues.\n\nFor those unfamiliar Alphapo processes payments for a number of gambling services such as HypeDrop, Bovada, and Ignition.\n\n\n\nIt remains unclear at this time how much BTC was stolen from Alphapo.\n\n\n\nAddresses\n\n0x040a96659fd7118259ebcd547771f6ecb9580d17\u2026 \u2014 ZachXBT (@zachxbt) July 23, 2023\n\nHacks are common in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nPeckShield, a blockchain intelligence firm, has in recent past recorded over 395 exploits cumulatively leading to the loss of more than $479.4 million. .\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Total ETH staked reached its highest value.\n\nAs positive sentiment waned, the price stagnated within a narrow range.\n\nEthereum [ETH] validators have deposited $52.3 billion into the ETH2.0 contract to secure the L1 Chain. According to on-chain data provider IntoTheBlock, this marked the highest value it has ever reached.\n\nThe Ethereum network is currently being secured by a staggering $52.3 billion, marking the highest value it has ever reached. As the value of #ETH used to secure the network increases, it becomes increasingly challenging for any potential attacker to gain control over it. pic.twitter.com/2hrzj82Nk0 \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) July 21, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nTo become a validator on the Ethereum PoS network, validators are required to deposit 32 ETH into the ETH 2.0 contract. As of the time of writing, the total number of ETH deposited into this contract by validators running the network was 27.05 million ETH, per data from Glassnode.\n\nThis represented 22.46% of the leading altcoin\u2019s total supply.\n\nState of the PoS network\n\nValidators on the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network are grouped into sets of committees and block proposers for each 32-slot Epoch. A validator on the committee is responsible for producing blocks for each 12-second slot.\n\nA validator on the committee is charged with the duty of producing blocks for each 12-second slot. However, if the assigned validator is unavailable, it will result in a missed block.\n\nData from Glassnode revealed that on 13 April (a day after the Shanghai Upgrade), the missed block count touched an all-time high of 658. This could be because some validators intentionally took their nodes offline during the upgrade and a day after it for a proper assessment of the impact of the upgrade.\n\nThis, however, soon declined. With only 42 missed blocks recorded on 21 July, missed block count has dropped by 94% since the 13 April high.\n\nFurther, to ensure that the PoS network runs optimally, there has to be a high degree of participation by Validators on the network.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, a high participation rate indicates reliable validator node uptime and, thus, fewer missed blocks and superior block space efficiency.\n\nOn 12 May, validators\u2019 participation rate slipped to its lowest point since December 2020. This dropped to 96%. It has, however, regained its spot at 99%, where it sat at the time of writing. This means almost all the network validators actively participated in block production.\n\nETH market continues its sideways movement\n\nAt press time, ETH exchanged hands at $1,892.25, with its price trading within a narrow range since the middle of the month.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe narrow movement of the market was confirmed by the state of the alt\u2019s Bollinger Bands at press time. ETH\u2019s price was positioned by the middle line of this indicator.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s price moves in this manner, it suggests that the asset was experiencing a period of relative stability or consolidation at press time. In this situation, there might not be a strong directional trend in the price movement, and the market might be indecisive."
