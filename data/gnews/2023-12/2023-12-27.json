        "content": "Several crypto startups are looking to develop the first-ever privacy-centric Ethereum L2.\n\nOn Ethereum today, transactions and other smart contract executions are all publicly visible. Transparency is a core principle of blockchain technology, meant to allow verification of systems and instill confidence, but it can also be a double-edged sword.\n\n\n\nWhile transparency ensures accountability, it also means that the details of these transactions and contracts are exposed to everyone, including malicious actors and hackers who can analyze transaction patterns, identify vulnerabilities in smart contract code, and exploit these weaknesses for nefarious purposes.\n\nPrivacy solutions offer dapp developers the opportunity to build applications that shore up these shortcomings without compromising security.\n\nIn the process, these privacy-first applications must endeavor to prevent harmful actors from concealing their identities, while protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens. In short, to avoid the fate of crypto mixer Tornado Cash, which allegedly was used to launder over $455 million stolen by sanctioned North Korean hackers.\n\nRead More: Tornado Cash Developer\u2019s Arrest Sparks Protest in Amsterdam\n\nHere are a few teams that are hoping to build a functioning privacy-centric L2:\n\nAztec\n\nAztec is a privacy layer of Ethereum. It\u2019s referred to as a hybrid solution using zkSNARKs and its very own programming language, Noir, to offer private transfers, meaning that the network is designed to validate transactions without revealing any sensitive information about them, such as the amount and parties involved.\n\nUnlike other zero-knowledge (zk) rollups on Ethereum, Aztec combines private and public execution in one single zk rollup. Meaning that a user\u2019s own device is responsible for encrypting the transactions before it is processed by the blockchain.\n\nIts primary focus, for now, is to design a platform for engineers to write private smart contracts without requiring in-depth mathematical knowledge of zk proofs. It recently revealed a new testing environment, Aztec Sandbox, for interested developers and plans for a testnet launch early next year.\n\nFhenix\n\nEncryption start-up Fhenix hopes to bring fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to smart contracts.\n\nUnlike privacy startups that use zero-knowledge technology, where data must be moved off-chain and decrypted in order for a prover to verify its accuracy, FHE encryption performs computations directly on encrypted data.\n\nBy keeping data on chain, the network will have the capability to process computations that come from various sources, such as an on-chain poker game or a sealed-bid auction contract.\n\nFhenix launched a developer testnet in July and plans for a full-scale testnet launch of its FHE rollup in early 2024.\n\nCOTI\n\nCOTI is a privacy L2 building on Ethereum. Unlike Aztec, which uses zkSNARKS and Fhenix with FHE, COTI V2 will use so-called Garbled Circuits to enable private transactions.\n\nGarbled Circuits enable two different parties to evaluate information, even if they distrust one another. The parties can each submit their \u2018garbled\u2019 or encrypted inputs, computations are conducted on these inputs and an outcome is obtained.\n\nCOTI will launch a developer testnet V2 in Q2 of 2024, and its mainnet launch will come soon after.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "zkSync, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, recorded more transactions than the Ethereum mainnet over a one-month period, processing 34.7 million transactions in the past 30 days.\n\nA total of 34.2 million transactions were recorded on Ethereum's mainnet during the same period, according to L2Beat data. Next in line was Arbitrum, which saw 31.4 million transactions over the past 30 days.\n\nThe recent rise in transaction volume on zkSync has been attributed to the spread of inscriptions \u2014 a feature originally created on Bitcoin \u2014 to EVM networks, including most Layer 2 chains.\n\nData from L2Beat highlights that zkSync experienced its biggest monthly transaction surge on Dec. 16. That's when sync inscription was rolled out on the network and constituted 4.6 million of the 5.3 million transactions that day alone, according to Dune data aggregated by Dragonfly analyst Hildobby.\n\nInscription-related transactions\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nzkSync operates as a Layer 2 network on the Ethereum mainnet. By bundling hundreds or thousands of transactions into a single cryptographic proof, it verifies transactions much faster and more cheaply than the mainnet.\n\nSince mid-December, inscription-related transactions have contributed to zkSync\u2019s overall activity, helping it surpass both Ethereum and its Layer 2s.\n\nInscriptions are data embeds found in transaction call data, which, like Ordinals on Bitcoin, can be used to create alternate tokens and NFTs. Such tokens include Ethscriptions on Ethereum, Doginals on Dogecoin and Solana Inscriptions on Solana."

        "content": "Ethereum has been upstaged by one of its layer 2s in 30-day transaction count.\n\nZkSync\u2019s transaction spike has resulted in lower fees.\n\nDevelopment is positive step for Ethereum's scalability.\n\nEthereum has been knocked off its perch, at least when it comes to the monthly number of transactions.\n\nZkSync, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, has managed to process more transactions than Ethereum in the last 30 days, according to data from L2Beat, a portal that tracks data for such buzzy blockchains.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a feat because it is the first time Ethereum has been surpassed by any of its layer 2s in 30-day transaction numbers.\n\nEthereum layer 2 blockchains like zkSync help scale the blockchain with increased speed while relying on the mainnet\u2019s security.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n30-day transaction count for Ethereum and its layer-2s. Source: L2Beat\n\nIt\u2019s also significant that the transaction spike has not resulted in higher fees on zkSync. Instead, fees have dipped 44% within the same period, data from blockchain analytics portal growthepie shows.\n\nIt currently costs about $0.13 to use the network to send tokens while it is $2 on the Ethereum mainnet. More complicated transactions like token swaps cost even higher, as much as $35 as of the time of reporting.\n\nThis fee decline supports the expectation that zkSync should become cheaper to use as it scales.\n\nZkSync\u2019s run to the top of the ladder has come amid a boom in inscriptions on Ethereum-based blockchains.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nInscriptions are data files for applications like NFTs and meme coins embedded on blockchains in a way that is supposed to be cheaper than using smart contracts.\n\nThey first emerged on Bitcoin but have now become a trend on Ethereum-based blockchains.\n\nTotal investor deposits in zkSync, as measured by \"total value locked\"\n\nTransaction-spamming associated with the inscriptions trend has become a stress test for blockchains like zkSync and Arbitrum with the latter going offline on December 15.\n\nThe milestone also comes after zkSync had a minor hiccup on Christmas. Block production was paused amid a temporary network outage for the blockchain.\n\nThe developers behind zkSync said the problem was due to a bug in the chain\u2019s server and promised a full post-mortem of the incident. Some security researchers say the issue may have involved the blockchain\u2019s Sequencer.\n\nZkSync uses a Sequencer to verify, organise, and bundle transactions to Ethereum for finality. Layer 2 Sequencers have been prone to faults in the past with Arbitrum, a zkSync suffering a similar fate in June.\n\nApart from Inscriptions, zkSync\u2019s transaction count also has a prominent airdrop footprint. Matter Labs has been mum about the possibility of an airdrop, but that has not stopped DeFi users from piling into the chain in hopes of a potential airdrop win.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin has proposed three strategies to address the increasing complexity of the PoS consensus mechanism.\n\nOne strategy involves increasing the minimum amount of Ether required to operate as a validator.\n\nAnother strategy suggests implementing a two-tier staking system with one layer having more stringent requirements and another layer having more lenient requirements.\n\nA third approach involves randomly assigning validators to slots to distribute the workload more evenly.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has put forward three solutions aimed at addressing what he terms a potential systemic complexity in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nIn a recent post , Buterin suggested a design overhaul to limit the requirement to just 8,192 signatures per slot, a move that could significantly simplify and lighten the consensus implementation.\n\nButerin\u2019s Three Strategies\n\nThe proposal comes as a response to the challenge posed by the increasing number of validators on the Ethereum network, which, in turn, amplifies the volume of cryptographic signatures needed to maintain network functionality.\n\nA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 27, 2023\n\nThese signatures are fundamental to the network\u2019s operation, but their growing number could burden the system, especially with upcoming upgrades expected to further escalate these requirements.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal, recently shared on the Ethereum Research forum , centers around efficiently reducing the signature count to manage this burgeoning complexity.\n\nThe proposal includes :\n\nDecentralized Staking Pools: The first method proposed by Buterin involves increasing the minimum amount of Ether required to operate as a validator. This change would necessitate validators to collaborate and pool their resources, promoting the formation of decentralized staking pools. Dual-Layer Staking System: The second strategy suggests the implementation of a two-tier staking system. In this model, one layer would have more stringent requirements, while the other would be more lenient. These layers would play distinct roles in the block finalization process, offering a balanced approach to validator participation and responsibilities. Rotating Validator Participation: The third approach introduces a system where a randomly selected group of validators is assigned to each slot. This method aims to distribute the workload more evenly among validators, thereby reducing the overall number of necessary signatures. However, Buterin acknowledges that this solution could introduce additional complexity into the system.\n\nA New Era of Efficient and Scalable Consensus Mechanism\n\nEthereum\u2019s consensus mechanism, especially after its transition to Ethereum 2.0, is based on a Proof of Stake (PoS) model, a significant shift from the original Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism.\n\nIn PoS, the process of validating transactions and creating new blocks is handled by validators, who are chosen on the amount of cryptocurrency (Ether, in Ethereum\u2019s case) they hold and are willing to \u201cstake\u201d as collateral. This staking process is less energy-intensive compared to the computational work required in PoW.\n\nThe issue that the Ethereum founder wants to raise here is that validators participating in the Proof-of-Stake network are required to sign and approve transactions many times. As the network has more and more validators, the number of signatures will also increase exponentially,\u2026 \u2014 jesica guardad (@jkimyw) December 28, 2023\n\nValidators are selected to propose and vote on new blocks, with their influence proportional to the size of their stake. This method aims to enhance network security and scalability, as well as reduce energy consumption.\n\nThe consensus is achieved when validators agree on the state of the blockchain, ensuring that all transactions are accurate and no double-spending occurs. This mechanism plays a crucial role in Ethereum\u2019s ability to execute smart contracts and maintain a decentralized, trustless system."

        "content": "Key Takeaways The Grand Canyon Education share price has been trending higher, but on lower-than-average trading volumes.\n\nIovance shares gapped sharply lower, although they closed well above their session lows.\n\nEthereum's price has broken above a pennant, a chart pattern that typically indicates a continuation of the current trend.\n\nHere's our daily look at three charts connected to recent news-driven price moves, with key technical levels to monitor.\n\nGrand Canyon Education, Inc.\n\nSource: TradingView.com.\n\nShares in Grand Canyon Education (LOPE) may come under the microscope Thursday after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said it has filed a lawsuit against the education services provider for deceptive advertising, illegal telemarketing and misrepresenting the school as a nonprofit organization. A key element of the FTC\u2019s filing alleges that the school has deceived prospective doctoral students about the cost and course requirements of its doctoral programs. The lawsuit comes just two months after the U.S. Department of Education issued Grand Canyon Education with a $37.7 million fine over similar claims. According to the department, less than 2% of the school's doctoral program graduates completed their program within the advertised cost, with nearly 80% of these students taking at least five continuation courses.\n\nSince staging a convincing break above a key area of resistance around $120, the LOPE share price has continued to grind higher. However, apart from the initial wide-ranging day in early November, the move has occurred on lower-than-average trading volumes, indicating a lack of buying conviction. If news-related selling takes place, keep an eye on the previous $120 resistance level, which may now turn into a key area of support on the chart.\n\nIovance Biotherapeutics, Inc.\n\nSource: TradingView.com.\n\nCancer immunotherapy company Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA) plunged 18.7% on Wednesday after announcing that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has halted its experimental cell therapy in lung cancer patients following the death of patient. The setback could potentially pause the trial for months, delaying the biotech\u2019s plans to develop a successful therapy to treat non-small cell lung cancer. \"Beyond the time it takes to actually resolve the clinical hold, it is possible that the hold results in recruitment losing momentum, potentially exacerbating the delay to data,\" Truist analyst Asthika Goonewardene wrote in a client note cited by Reuters. Although Iovance uses the same therapy to treat melanoma, the FDA\u2019s pause will have no impact on any other trials, the company said.\n\nAfter bottoming out in late October, IOVA has staged an impressive rally to now trade above the 200-day moving average. Although the stock gapped sharply lower on yesterday\u2019s open, it closed well above its session lows, indicating that some investors saw the sell-off as a dip-buying opportunity. However, if further selling occurs, monitor the area between $5 and $6 on the chart, which may find support from a previous downtrend line and the 50-day moving average.\n\nEthereum\n\nSource: TradingView.com.\n\nEthereum gained over 6% on Wednesday as investors repositioned into the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization ahead of several notable events taking place in January. The blockchain-based network is undergoing a significant upgrade next month that\u2019s expected to reduce costs across its infrastructure, such as minimizing fees on its layer 2 solutions. Investors also anticipate a decision in January from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Many crypto investors are of the belief that the securities watchdog would shortly thereafter green stamp a spot Ethereum ETF. Over the past month Ethereum has significantly underperformed other leading cryptocurrencies, such as Solana and Avax.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has continued to trend higher since the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average in late November to form a golden cross\u2014a pattern that investors typically interpret as marking the start of a new bull market. More recently, the price has broken out from a pennant pattern indicating a continuation of the current uptrend. If Ether continues to climb, it\u2019s worth monitoring important chart levels around $3,300 and $3,550, which may provide resistance from several key horizontal trendlines. Alternatively, a breakdown below the pattern could indicate a potential bull trap and change in trend direction.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Proposes Simplified Ethereum Proof of Stake Design - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Proposes Simplified Ethereum Proof of Stake Design\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed three alternative methods aimed at simplifying the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s proof of stake design.\n\nThis initiative, according to Buterin\u2019s latest blog post, is intended to address a potential systemic complexity within Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism. The proposals center on reducing the number of signatures required per slot in the blockchain.\n\nAccording to Buterin, Ethereum is currently supporting 895,000 validator objects for decentralization, processing about 28,000 signatures in a single day and 1,790,000 post-SSF. His detailed idea intended to reduce the load to 8,192 signatures per slot post-SSF.\n\nEthereum Proof of Stake Simplification Proposal\n\n\n\nButerin\u2019s first proposal, the shift towards decentralized staking pools, aims to simplify the proof of stake process by reducing the number of individual validators. This approach requires increasing the minimum ether required for staking, thereby compelling smaller validators to form pools.\n\nA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 27, 2023\n\n\u201cWe could raise the min deposit size to 4,096 ETH and make a total cap of 4,096 validators,\u201d said Buterin.\n\nThe second proposal introduces a dual-layer of stakers to ensure network security and efficiency. Buterin explained this as creating \u201ca \u2018heavy\u2019 layer with a 4,096 ETH requirement that participates in finalization, and a \u2018light\u2019 layer with no minimum.\u201d\n\nButerin\u2019s third proposal, involving a rotating set of validators, is designed to distribute the validation process more evenly across the network. He suggests, \u201cFor each slot, we choose 4,096 currently active validators, and we carefully adjust that set during each slot in such a way that we still have safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy Not Just Do Committees\u201d\n\n\n\nVitalik Buterin highlighted the limitations of the committee-based security model used by other blockchains. This model, which selects a group of validators randomly for each slot, lacks accountability in case of a 51% attack. In such an attack, the economic cost to the perpetrators is minimal since most validators involved in the attack remain unseen, not being chosen for the committee.\n\nContrastingly, Ethereum\u2019s current system imposes severe penalties for similar attacks, slashing a large fraction of the attacking validators\u2019 deposits. While Ethereum\u2019s high penalty approach is effective, it might be excessively punitive. So a balanced solution that still maintains a high total amount of slashable Ethereum but makes some concessions on validator accountability would be the answer."

        "content": "Why Do We Need Gas in the Ethereum Ecosystem?\n\nGas\u2019s primary function is to reduce ETH\u2019s volatility. ETH is publicly tradeable and listed on exchanges. As a result, it is directly subject to market volatility. Petrol is not listed on any exchange, so it is not directly affected by market volatility. An Ethereum smart contract requires more computational power than a straightforward transfer. In order to avoid instability, the fee must be meticulously designed.\n\nHow Is the Gas Price Determined?\n\nGas price is determined by two factors: the gas limit and the price of gas. The sender\u2019s gas limit is the utmost amount of gas they are willing to pay for the transaction. The cost of gas is determined by market supply and demand. The final gas price for the transaction is calculated by multiplying the two prices.\n\nGas Limit * Gas Price = Gas Fee\n\nGas Limit: Gas Limit is the maximum quantity of ETH that the sender is willing to spend on the transaction. Typically, when discussing Gas in Ethereum, one is referring to Gas Limit. Sending ETH requires the shipper to set Gas Limit. If there is insufficient Gas Limit to complete the transfer, the transfer will be cancelled and the shipper will receive a Gas refund. Alternatively, if the sender specifies an excessive Gas Limit, any excess Gas will be returned to the sender.\n\nGas Price: Gas Price indicates the cost of Gas in Gwei. For instance, 1 Gas equals 10 Gwei. It is primarily determined by supply and demand in the market. Gas Price is multiplied by Gas Limit to ascertain the cost of gas.\n\nWhat Are the Factors Affecting Gas Fees?\n\nUnderstanding the dynamics of gas fees involves recognizing the factors that influence their fluctuations:\n\nNetwork Congestion: Ethereum\u2019s popularity has led to network congestion during peak usage times. As more transactions compete for limited block space, gas fees tend to increase.\n\nGas Price: Users can set their preferred gas price. A higher gas price increases the likelihood of a transaction being processed promptly, but it also incurs higher costs.\n\nTransaction Complexity: The computational resources required to execute a transaction or smart contract influence its gas fee. More complex operations demand more gas.\n\nGas Limit: Each Ethereum transaction has a gas limit, which represents the maximum amount of gas a user is willing to spend. If a transaction\u2019s computational requirements exceed the gas limit, the transaction will fail, and the user will still be charged.\n\nExternal Events: Market fluctuations, platform upgrades, and major smart contract executions can impact gas fees.\n\nWhat Are the Strategies to Optimize Gas Fees?\n\nNavigating the Ethereum gas fee landscape requires a strategic approach. Consider these tips to optimize your transactions:\n\nGas Estimators: Various online tools and wallets provide gas estimators that recommend a suitable gas price based on network conditions. These estimators help you strike a balance between prompt execution and cost efficiency.\n\nOff-Peak Usage: Initiate transactions during periods of lower network activity. Gas fees tend to be lower during off-peak times.\n\nLayer 2 Solutions: Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, aim to alleviate Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues by processing transactions off-chain and settling them on-chain. These solutions can significantly reduce gas fees and transaction times.\n\nBatch Transactions: Some wallets and platforms allow users to bundle multiple transactions into a single batch. This approach can save on gas costs, as multiple transactions are processed in a single block.\n\nGas Tokens: Gas tokens are tokens that can be minted when gas prices are low and burned (destroyed) when gas prices are high. This mechanism enables users to hedge against future gas price increases.\n\nSmart Contract Efficiency: Developers can optimize smart contracts to minimize gas consumption. This includes techniques like reducing unnecessary storage operations and using more efficient algorithms.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum gas fees are an integral aspect of the network\u2019s functionality. While they can present challenges, they are also a testament to Ethereum\u2019s popularity and utility. By understanding the factors that influence gas fees and implementing optimization strategies, users can navigate the Ethereum ecosystem more effectively and make the most of its innovative applications."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin outlines new Ethereum PoS strategy for post-Shanghai era - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "In a detailed blog post dated Dec. 27, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin outlined a significant shift in Ethereum\u2019s approach to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validation following its Shanghai upgrade.\n\nEthereum currently supports many validators, with approximately 895,000 validator objects enabling a broad individual and entity participation base. This is a key feature of Ethereum\u2019s decentralized structure.\n\nHowever, this model presents technical challenges, notably the processing of an immense number of signatures. About 28,000 signatures are required to validate a block today; that number is projected to reach 1.79 million post-SSF (Sharding and Staking Finality).\n\nThe technical sacrifices for supporting such a load are considerable. They include complex attestation propagation mechanisms, the need for hyper-optimized BLS signature operations, the lack of a viable quantum-resistant alternative, and increased slot times due to more sub-slots.\n\nButerin also highlights the current model\u2019s systemic complexity and potential ineffectiveness in truly democratizing staking, as the minimum staking requirement of 32 ETH remains financially prohibitive for many.\n\n8,192 signatures\n\nIn response, Buterin proposes a pivot that would reduce the number of signatures per slot to a manageable 8,192. This change, he argues, would open up the PoS design space, allow technical simplification, improve security, and address quantum resistance concerns.\n\nButerin critiques the committee-based security approach used by other blockchains, emphasizing the lack of accountability and insufficient deterrents against attacks. Ethereum, in contrast, imposes severe penalties on attackers. Still, Buterin suggests that even a reduced cost of attack (1-2 million ETH) would be sufficient, advocating for a balanced solution that maintains high penalties but offers more benefits than a smaller validator set.\n\nThe blog post explores three approaches for implementing the 8,192 signatures per slot under SSF:\n\nDecentralized Staking Pools: Focusing solely on decentralized stake pools, potentially raising the minimum deposit size, and capping penalties to reduce trust in node operators. Two-Tiered Staking: Establish a \u201cheavy\u201d layer for major stakers involved in finalization and a \u201clight\u201d layer for additional security, with no minimum stake requirement. Rotating Participation (Accountable Committees): A hybrid approach where validators participate based on their stake, ensuring safety through carefully adjusted validator sets.\n\nButerin\u2019s conclusion emphasizes that sticking to 8,192 signatures would greatly simplify technical implementation and make Ethereum more accessible. The focus would then shift to choosing the most suitable approach from the proposed options.\n\nSecurity through simplicity\n\nSome users raised concerns in the comments about designing systems resilient against state attackers, suggesting that even a reduced security budget might be insufficient. Buterin responded by emphasizing the importance of simplicity in protocol design as a means of defense against various attack vectors, advocating for \u201csecurity through simplicity.\u201d\n\nThis proposed shift signifies a pivotal moment in Ethereum\u2019s ongoing development, highlighting the constant balance of security, decentralization, and usability."

        "title": "Ethereum outlook 2024: institutional adoption, oil wealth, and L2 expansion - KITCO",
        "content": "(Kitco News) - 2023 was a year of recovery for the cryptocurrency market after the events of 2022 \u2013 including the collapse of Terra/Luna and FTX \u2013 resulted in the total crypto market cap falling by $2.27 trillion, a decline of more than 75% from its peak in November 2021.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-ranked crypto by market cap, mirrored the decline in the broader market, with its price falling from a high of $4,850 in Nov. 2021 to $1,190 on Jan. 1, 2023, a decline of 75.5%.\n\nSince then, Ether has more than doubled in price, hitting a 2023 high of $2,405 on Dec. 9. ETH has been bolstered by the start of the next bull market cycle for cryptocurrencies and optimism around the potential approval of the first spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) after multiple large asset managers, including BlackRock, filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\"The fate of a spot Ethereum ETF looms large,\" said Daniel Krupka, head of research at Coin Bureau. \"A successful ETF approval could lead to significant institutional investment, potentially driving ETH's price higher. However, concerns around censorship resistance if the ETF is staked need to be addressed.\"\n\n\"Centralization within the staking ecosystem requires careful monitoring,\" he said. \"Lido Finance's dominance in staked ETH raises concerns about potential control and manipulation.\"\n\nKrupka identified Ethereum's layer-2 (L2) fragmentation as a potential headwind. \"Ensuring interoperability between different layer 2 solutions is crucial for Ethereum's long-term scalability and adoption,\" he said.\n\nDespite those concerns, Krupka said, \"Ethereum's position as the leading proof-of-stake blockchain remains a significant advantage. This inherent security is likely to attract institutional investors, particularly if competitors encounter scalability and security issues.\"\n\nBased on this understanding, Coin Bureau's analysis suggests Ether's price \"could reach its previous all-time high of approximately $4,890 by the end of 2024,\" he said.\n\n\"Ethereum's outlook for 2024 hinges on institutional adoption, fueled by the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF,\" Krupka said. \"While Ethereum faces challenges like layer 2 fragmentation and centralization concerns, its inherent security remains a key draw for institutional investors.\"\n\n\"ETH's main catalyst going into 2024 will be its own ETF,\" said Johnny Gabriele, head of decentralized finance at CryptoOracle. \"It has already been filed, and the second the Bitcoin ETF is approved, the narrative will instantly shift to the ETH version driving the same price action the Bitcoin enjoyed in November and December.\"\n\n\"Once that happens, activity on the L1 and its many L2s will cause a lot of ETH to be burned (a mechanism put into place after 'The 'Merge'),\" he said. \"This will further draw attention to the asset and drive the staking yield to above 5%.\"\n\n\"A third narrative of tokenizing Real World Assets will bring even more institutional and retail players into the ecosystem, allowing Ethereum to blow past all-time highs,\" Gabriele said. \"Ethereum will hit $8,000 in 2024 and shoot well past $10,000 in 2025 before a blow-off top starts the next bear market.\"\n\nOil and Ethereum\n\nGuy Gotslak, co-founder and president of My Digital Money, said that while many analysts are focused on the ETH ETF talk, there is \"one critical game-changer\" that many are overlooking: oil.\n\n\"The TLDR version is that the oil industry of the Middle East could end up fully operating in the Ethereum blockchain,\" he said. \"UAE, Saudi Arabia, and neighboring oil-heavy nations account for more than 20% of global oil exports. I don't have to discuss the importance of oil.\"\n\nGotslak noted that in 2022, \"a Saudi Arabian [used] Ethereum to pay for a Mercedes Benz S580 from USA-based Jeff Wyler Automotive,\" and that \"The process was said to have been faster than any wire transfer.\"\n\n\"While many may credit this to being a novelty transaction, the Middle East has been making concrete steps towards the blockchain,\" he said. \"It hosted ETH Riyadh 2023, a conference dedicated to the Ethereum ecosystem and blockchain technology. The conference gathered developers and builders from Saudi and other regions in the Middle East.\"\n\nHe added that Dubai has also \"started digitizing itself to ensure the efficiency of all government offices and to provide both local and visitor experiences with quick and efficient responses to needs. This will be made possible by using the blockchain and artificial intelligence,\" he said.\n\n\"Their goal is to 'achieve efficiency by using blockchain in 100% of applicable government services, creating and enabling blockchain ecosystem for startups and businesses, and to become a global thought leader by piloting cross-border blockchain cases,'\" Gotslak said.\n\nPart of this effort includes the goal of going paperless, and \"all transaction, retail, wholesale, and government-controlled industries such as oil, will operate in the Ethereum blockchain.\"\n\n\"This is not just 'big,' this is a seismic shift in the global financial industry and the Ethereum blockchain will be at the center of it,\" Gotslak concluded.\n\nImprovements to the network\n\nVince Yang, founder of zkLink, said: \"All signs are signaling upside for Ethereum as the market shows spillover demand from the recent Bitcoin rally.\"\n\nHe noted that digital asset investment inflows are now at the highest level since Oct. 2021, with more than $1.76 billion flowing into these products over the past ten weeks, and \"20% of that moving into Ether.\"\n\n\"Ethereum's open interest has also risen above the $8 bn level,\" a development that has not been seen since last November, he added.\n\n\"On a fundamental level, demand continues to surge for the most profitable chain as Ethereum's TVL has risen from $21 billion in October to $32 billion,\" Yang said. \"The tech has also transitioned to full Proof of Stake (PoS) this cycle and no longer burns energy to produce blockspace. PoS also makes Ethereum deflationary to the tune of around 0.5% a year and existing Ethereum validators are earning 5.3% a year.\"\n\nHe also pointed to Ethereum's \"thriving ecosystem of blockspace buyers in the form of Layer-2 networks, applications, and users,\" highlighting that \"Five whole L2 blockchains are in the top 10 consumers of ETH blockspace, making them responsible for adoption and stimulating on-chain activities, thus increasing demand for ETH.\"\n\nYang said the thing that could potentially hinder Ethereum's growth would be if a spot ETH ETF was not approved this cycle, which would lead to Ether's price and adoption lagging behind Bitcoin.\n\nHe also identified a recession in the U.S. economy as a potential headwind. \"Recently, there has been almost $200bn liquidity injected into the U.S. economy, causing RRPs to fall while TGA remains unchanged,\" Yang said. \"Though this may not look bad, the practice of spiking liquidity is not sustainable in the long run for any economy. A recession could cause a re-factoring of all assets and we might not get the fairy tale ending we would like to see for crypto, let alone Ethereum.\"\n\nPelli Wang, co-founder of Bracket Labs, noted that ETH is \"relatively undervalued compared with BTC\" as its price has not increased as much throughout 2023.\n\n\"Moreover, there has been endless speculation for the BTC ETF approval, but there has been more muted discussion about the ETH ETF approval even though many large enterprises are building pilots and other use cases on ETH,\" she said. \"Therefore, I think there is a good potential for ETH to double to $5,000 by the end of 2024.\"\n\nAlan Scott, contributor at RAILGUN, said he thinks 2024 will \"continue to see deep value enter into the Ethereum ecosystem.\"\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of pivoting and repositioning of 'Alternative L1s' moving towards being L2s,\" he said. \"Since 'The Merge' (the switch to Proof of Stake), we've seen a net burn of ~300k-ish ETH. Many alt-L1s positioned themselves as 'ETH Killers,' but have come to realize Ethereum's death may never come. So, we've seen many blockchains start to position themselves as Ethereum L2s. This only adds to the value proposition of ETH.\"\n\n\"If I were forced to give a price guess, I would guess around the $6,000-$8,000 range,\" Scott said. \"Ether scarcity will play a factor in ETH pricing.\"\n\nJeff Owens, co-founder of Haven1, said the upcoming Dencun upgrade \"is likely to be a major catalyst for the ecosystem and ETH in Q1 2024.\"\n\nOwens said the core aspects of the Dencun upgrade include \"five critical Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), with EIP-4844 being the primary focus.\"\n\n\"EIP-4844 is a leap in scalability,\" he said. \"Known as proto-danksharding, this EIP aims to expand the blockchain's capacity by integrating data 'blobs,' which are projected to significantly lower gas fees for layer 2 rollups.\"\n\n\"Proto-danksharding is poised to draw more users to Ethereum, especially through rollups, and will help catalyze layer-2 adoption,\" he said. \"With over 90% of L2 transaction costs tied to L1 data storage, EIP-4844's data blobs are expected to slash L2 fees by at least ten times. Despite its technical complexity, the result will be straightforward for users - they will likely pay only a fraction of the current cost for L2 transactions, widening access.\"\n\nOwens said that the expansion of transactions on L2's made possible by proto-danksharding \"will likely cause a surge in transactions, especially with optimistic rollups already surpassing Ethereum mainnet in volume, boosting the overall economic activity on Ethereum.\"\n\n\"Although lower L2 fees might temporarily reduce ETH burning, the overall growth in Ethereum's transactional activity is expected to enhance its value in the medium term,\" he said.\n\nWhen it comes to headwinds on Ethereum's path forward, Owens highlighted regulatory challenges, technical setbacks, and network congestion.\n\n\"Any delays or technical issues in these upgrades could negatively impact investor confidence,\" he said. \"The network will still have issues when there are periods of high demand,\" which will continue to be perceived as a negative by many users.\n\n\"The Dencun upgrade, coupled with increasing excitement around Ethereum ETFs, is expected to sustain a bullish trend in Ethereum's price into Q1 2024,\" Owens concluded.\n\n\"We believe that upgrades to Ethereum relating to scalability will steal the show in 2024,\" said Jesper Johansen, founder and CEO of Northstake. \"As user adoption of Ethereum grows, the protocol will need to scale its operational capacity to facilitate more network transactions.\n\nProjects and integrations that increase the scalability of Ethereum's protocol will be one of the primary value drivers for ETH in 2024.\"\n\n\"Ethereum is as important and foundational to the growth of Web3 as large language models (LLMs) are for the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies,\" he said. \"When investors fully understand the implications of how Ethereum changes the way we transact online, Ethereum will grow and become increasingly valuable.\"\n\nPavel Matveev, co-founder and CEO of Wirex, also sees the Ether burn mechanism as a positive force on ETH price, along with a rising interest in derivatives and the token's correlation with Bitcoin (BTC).\n\n\"The supply of Ether turned deflationary again,\" Matveev said. \"About a month ago, the total supply of Ether started shrinking, dropping by over 44,000 ETH in the last 30 days. This reflects mostly the higher transaction activity observed on-chain: volumes are up and holding near the highest levels observed this semester.\"\n\n\"The interest in Ether derivatives is currently very high, reaching levels close to the highest point this year,\" he added. \"This suggests that more people are getting involved in the market. Ether also remains highly correlated with BTC and still plays an important role in diversifying a cryptocurrency portfolio.\"\n\nThat said, Matveev noted that \"the price of Ether has been underperforming Bitcoin's since June,\" as far more attention has been paid to the spot BTC ETF applications than the spot ETH\n\nETF applications\n\n\"Even though there are applications for Ether ETFs, they are still scarce, and would face a whole different challenge: the SEC treatment of PoS protocol native tokens has yet to be clarified,\" he said. \"The question is: are staking services turning PoS tokens into securities?\n\nIf uncertainty remains, more centralized exchanges could shut down or stay away from staking activities.\"\n\nBased on these factors, Matveev said a moderate price prediction for Ether at the end of Feb. 2024 is $2,700, and $4,000 by June.\n\nAnd Jamie Turner, head of marketing at Neon EVM, sees ETH hitting a price of $2,500 by the end of 2023 and exceeding $3,000 by the end of 2024 as \"all signs indicate that 2024 will be a bull run year.\"\n\nTurner identified stability brought by the release of new regulations in the U.S., E.U., and U.K. as the main catalyst that will bolster the price of ETH and the broader crypto market.\n\n"

        "content": "While there have been talks about Ethereum (ETH) staying dud for a while, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency is now making big moves. In the last 24 hours, the Ethereum (ETH) price has jumped by 9% currently trading at $2,424 levels with a market cap of $291 billion.\n\nEthereum Gears Up for 2024 Price Rally\n\nMarket analysts have been predicting that 2024 will be the year for Ethereum, and it shall close the gap with the Bitcoin market dominance.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn a recent surge, the long-dormant Ethereum (ETH) experienced a notable rally, surpassing the $2,400 mark and establishing a new high for the year. This rally has resulted in all major term implied volatilities (IVs) reaching yearly highs, while the 30-day volatility (DVOL) has soared to 70%, marking a new peak since April, reports, Greeks.Live.\n\nDespite this bullish movement, options data from Skew indicates that institutional traders have not yet joined the rally, maintaining recent levels without following the upward trend. The absence of institutional FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) suggests a cautious approach among these traders.\n\nAs highlighted in recent discussions, the year-end period is characterized by tight liquidity, making the market susceptible to sudden spikes and falls. Investors are navigating this environment with a focus on options purchases that offer a favorable breakeven ratio.\n\nEthereum Favorable Over Bitcoin for Q1 2024\n\nSo far, Bitcoin has dominated the crypto market rally during the fourth quarter of the year. On the other hand, while Ethereum has progressed, it has failed to keep up pace with Bitcoin.\n\nBut market analysts believe that Ethereum will lead the crypto market rally going into 2024. Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has suggested a historical pattern may be unfolding, indicating a peak in Bitcoin dominance before the upcoming Bitcoin halving. According to van de Poppe, this trend typically marks the commencement of a bull market for altcoins, with Ethereum expected to play a prominent role in this phase.\n\nApart from just ETH, the entire Ethereum ecosystem is heating up with Arbitrum and Optimism taking the lead as well. On the other hand, the Ethereum development is working on reducing the PoS complexity with founder Vitalik Buterin proposing some key solutions."

        "title": "3 reasons why Ethereum (ETH) price nearly broke the $2.5K resistance this week - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum network, has risen by 5.5% since Dec. 27, even though it failed to break above the $2,400 resistance. Traders are now questioning what has been driving the price of Ether up and whether these factors remain of importance.\n\nEther price reaches a 19-month high as traders anticipate a rally above $2,500\n\nThe intraday high of $2,446 on Dec. 28 was last seen over 19 months ago. This increase occurred while the broader cryptocurrency market capitalization remained flat at $1.68 trillion. This suggests that Ether\u2019s price could continue its bullish momentum toward $2,500, despite the average transaction fee exceeding $5. While this may not seem excessive, it can be burdensome for most decentralized application (DApp) users.\n\nOne can easily fall for the narratives that competing chains are gaining relevance, as critics claim that the Ethereum network has failed due to its limited capacity for scaling and privacy solutions at the base layer level. This negative conversation has been heightened by the recent outperformance of Solana\u2019s SOL (SOL) and Binance\u2019s BNB (BNB), which have gained 78% and 44%, respectively, in the past 30 days. As an example, an experienced Solana ecosystem developer, Matty Taylor, posted about this issue on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nSome info for anyone pushing the narrative that Ethereum is best positioned to become the RWA/institutional chain:\n\n\n\nTradFi institutions are even more sensitive than memecoin traders to fees, speed & overall infra performance.\n\n\n\nSee why Visa chose @Solana.https://t.co/tNGpgvNekG \u2014 mattytay (@mattytay) December 28, 2023\n\nHowever, this analysis fails to consider the undeniable success of Ethereum layer-2 blockchains and the dominance of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Moreover, the Ethereum network\u2019s total value locked (TVL) of $29.6 billion invalidates much of the negative assessment. In comparison, BNB Chain holds a mere $3.6 billion TVL, while Solana\u2019s latest data stands at $1.4 billion, according to DefiLlama.\n\nOne might argue that not every DApp requires a huge TVL, and even the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry is working to maximize the usage of its deposits. Therefore, other metrics such as transactions and the number of active addresses are better suited to measure adoption.\n\nBlockchains ranked by 7-day DApp volumes, USD. Source: DappRadar\n\nApart from its absolute layer-1 dominance, the Ethereum network has posted a 38% growth in volumes over the past seven days, distancing itself from BNB Chain and Solana. Notable highlights on Ethereum include Uniswap\u2019s $20 billion volume in the period, followed by Balancer\u2019s $9.4 billion and Cowswap\u2019s $900 million. In comparison, BNB Chain\u2019s leading application, PancakeSwap, has gathered $4.2 billion in the same period.\n\nEthereum\u2019s layer-2 scaling solutions have exceeded expectations in terms of activity\n\nWhen accounting for Ethereum layer-2 solutions, the ecosystem surpasses any competitor in terms of active addresses engaging with DApps. Besides the established Polygon network, the privacy-focused zkSync Era has catapulted the aggregate Ethereum rollups\u2019 unique active addresses to 2 million in seven days. The zero-knowledge rollup is expected to launch a token in the near future, creating increased demand for its network use.\n\nRelated: Why is Solana (SOL) price down today?\n\nEther\u2019s price increase has also been boosted by research published by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin on Dec. 28, which proposes a method to reduce the load on validators, theoretically reducing the number of required signatures by 70% and making the process more quantum-resistant. The proposal offers three solutions: decentralized staking pools, a \u201clight\u201d staking method and a rotation between accountable committees.\n\nLastly, Ethereum\u2019s upcoming upgrade, Cancun, is set to undergo testing starting on Jan. 17. It aims to lower transaction fees and introduces new features for bridges and staking pools. Notably, it will include Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844, or \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which will enhance rollup networks\u2019 efficiency by temporarily storing transaction data in a new format called \u201cblobs,\u201d significantly reducing layer-2 transaction fees.\n\nData shows that Ether\u2019s rally has been fueled by increased network and ecosystem use, dominance in terms of DApp deposits, and expectations of further improvements stemming from upgrades. Those changes will likely solidify its leadership in terms of smart contract processing and staking mechanisms.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Should it come true, Ethereum (ETH) could soar by 50% in near future.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price's next target indicated by analyst\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price smashed through the crucial \"weekly support retest\" over $2,100. As such, another 50% upsurge might be on the menu, trader Jacob Canfield opined on X today, Dec. 28, 2023.\n\nAre you guys ready for $ETH to teleport?\n\n\n\nWeekly support retest complete.\n\n\n\nTime to accelerate \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/bvxNA2YO3f \u2014 Jacob Canfield (@JacobCanfield) December 28, 2023\n\nThe next target for Ethereum (ETH) price can be found at $3,600. As such, the trader asks his audience whether it is ready for \"teleport\" to such impressive price levels and admits that the time to accelerate has come.\n\nToday, in the early morning hours, the Ethereum (ETH) price set new 2023 high over $2,440. By press time, it retraced to $2,400.\n\nThe last time Ethereum (ETH) was trading over $3,600 was in April 2021, right before the collapse of the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem and the 2021-2022 Crypto Winter.\n\nThis year, the Ethereum (ETH) price more than doubled; in late December 2022, the second-largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $1,200.\n\nSolana (SOL) \"takes a breath,\" loses 17% from 2023 peak\n\nCanfield is also bullish on the midterm future of Solana (SOL), a key Ethereum (ETH) competitor. As covered by U.Today previously, he indicated a crucial catalyst for Solana (SOL) demand.\n\nAccording to his theory, the Solana (SOL) community needs more tokens to take part in potential retroactive airdrop campaigns. This frenzy was triggered by massive JTO token distribution organized by Jito Finance, a Lido copycat on Solana (SOL).\n\nMeanwhile, the price of Solana (SOL) retraced after the 900% rally of last 12 months. It reached a local high over $123, but now it is changing hands at $100."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nLark Davis predicts Ethereum\u2019s significant rise in 2024.\n\nPotential ETH value forecasted at $15,000 per coin.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum is considered a low-risk crypto move.\n\nCrypto YouTuber Lark Davis has been making headlines, predicting a significant upswing for Ethereum in 2024. Davis notes that while Ethereum has been underperforming compared to its peers this year, it\u2019s poised for a big move.\n\nEthereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think pic.twitter.com/00YCLPyGCl \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 25, 2023\n\nDavis also forecasts a potential rise in Ethereum\u2019s value to around $15,000 per coin during the 2024-2025 bull cycle, assuming gains similar to or slightly less than the previous cycle.\n\nHis prediction is based on a hypothetical 200% increase from Ethereum\u2019s previous high of about $4,880 in November 2021. For current buyers, this could mean a 500-600% gain, which Davis considers a relatively low-risk bet in the crypto world. He emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s strong fundamentals despite recent disinterest from the crypto community.\n\nSo, is he right to think so?\n\nETH Price Prediction 2024\n\nAfter reaching its all-time high of $4,820, the price of ETH fell by 81%, measured to its lowest point of $880 in this bear cycle made on June 18, 2022. It started a recovery and was mostly trending upward in 2023, resulting in a high of $2,400 on December 9.\n\nEthereum didn\u2019t go any lower, contrary to the general market trend, as we saw lower prices for most of the cryptos in November and December of 2022 before they started their significant recoveries.\n\nETH has performed worse than the general market since the start of 2023, but measuring from the June 18 low, it still outperformed many of its altcoin competitors, recovering 171%.\n\nIt formed an ascending triangle, which could be a leading diagonal as the first sub-wave of the larger five-wave impulse in the starting bull market. We are waiting for its wave 2 \u2013 the first bull market correction that can push the price back to the $1,600 area.\n\nThat would be similar to the horizontal structure seen in the last pre-bull market consolidation from December 2018 until December 2019 and mark the end of the accumulation period.\n\nAfter it ends, we look at the start of a stronger move for its wave 3, which will bring the price to its new all-time high of around $5,000. From the strength and the price this move reaches, we could evaluate the possibility of ETH going to $15,000 at its peak in the next bull run.\n\nHowever, in conclusion, this price target isn\u2019t unrealistic and is only a 200% increase since its previous all-time high, making it highly possible.\n\nDisclaimers\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

The Ethereum team has not yet announced when Dencun will be implemented on the mainnet.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade includes several tools aimed at reducing fees, enabling new features for bridges and staking pools, and limiting the use of self-destruct operations on smart contracts.\n\nOne of the key features of Dencun is the inclusion of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, also known as \"proto-danksharding.\"\n\nThis will allow layer-2 (L2) rollup networks to store certain transaction data temporarily using a new format called \"blobs.\" Blobs can be deleted after 18 days, significantly reducing transaction fees on layer 2s. This is a highly anticipated upgrade for L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nOther notable proposals in the Dencun upgrade include:\n\nEIP-1153: Introduces a \"transient storage\" system to further reduce fees.\n\nEIP-4788: Increases transparency by storing the root of each Beacon Chain block in a smart contract.\n\nEIP-6780: Limits the use of the self-destruct keyword to prevent the erasure of smart contract code and the transfer of funds to the deployer.\n\nEthereum upgrades typically undergo testing for a few months before being deployed to the mainnet. The previous upgrade, codenamed \"Shapella,\" began testing in February and was launched to the mainnet in April. Shapella was a major upgrade and saw Ethereum transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake."

This brings to mind previous reports where Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko said he envisions a future where SOL and Ether co-exist, urging that the whole narrative of one ecosystem kills the other be binned.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto hack: Ethereum, Solana DeFi trading platform Thunder exploited for $239,000\n\nEther displays upside potential as Solana price shows weakness\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has spent the better part of December consolidating between the critical support at $ 2,147 and the $2,380 resistance level. Based on technicals such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the largest cryptocurrency may be poised to shine, at least for the short term.\n\nMeanwhile, the SOL market is exhibiting weakness, as the technical indicators hint at a possible dip in the Solana price. It comes after a prolonged period of SOL being massively overbought, indicated by the presence of the RSI above the 70 level since October 18, when the markets turned bullish. This preceded a correction.\n\nSOL/USDT 1-day chart, ETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nEthereum price outlook with ETH shining at Solana\u2019s expense\n\nAfter Solana price\u2019s epic surge across the fourth quarter, the SOL market is taking a breather, with capital flowing into Ether. With this, Ethereum price looks ready to shine at the expense of Solana.\n\nThe RSI is northbound, suggesting rising momentum. The Awesome Oscillators (AO) indicator remains in the positive territory, adding credence to the bullish thesis. Increased buying pressure above current levels, therefore, could see Ethereum price rise, potentially flipping the $2,380 resistance level to a support before testing the $2,403 range high.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the gains could extend for Ethereum price to tag the forecasted $2,500 psychological level, in a move that would constitute a 7% climb above current levels.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the $2,380 roadblock holds as resistance, the ensuing rejection could see Ethereum price lose the critical support at $2,147, below which the bullish outlook would be invalidated. In the dire case, Ether market value could descend to test the supply barrier that now acts as a bullish breaker between $2,049 and $2,107.\n\nA break and close below the midline at $2,075 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend, with Ethereum price likely to spiral towards the $2,049 support, levels last tested in November."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Dencun Upgrade Approaches in January \u2013 Can ETH Reach $4,000?\n\nThe price of Ether (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the smart-contract-enabled layer-1 Ethereum blockchain protocol, has been pushing higher amid a favorable macro backdrop and as investors start looking ahead to the major upcoming \u201cDencun\u201d upgrade that will add new data storage capacity to the network.\n\nETH hit new highs for the year on Thursday in the $2,440s before pulling back below $2,400 once again, taking its gains in the past 24 hours to around 3.5%, in the past seven days to over 6.5% and in the last 30 days to over 17%, as per CoinMarketCap.\n\nUS stocks continued pushing higher on Thursday, with the S&P 500 crawling to within 1% of the record highs it printed in early 2022 above 4,800 as US yields and the US Dollar Index (DXY) continue to slide amid bets that the Fed will soon start lowering interest rates.\n\nExpectations of easier financial and liquidity conditions ahead have been a major tailwind for crypto in recent months and look set to offer ETH continued support.\n\nETH volatility could pick up significantly on Friday, a day when a whopping $3.36 billion in ETH options expire as per data presented by The Block, the largest quarterly expiry on record.\n\nBut otherwise, focus is likely to remain on upcoming ETH-relevant themes, such as the positive macro backdrop, the upcoming Dencun upgrade, and growing anticipation that spot Ethereum ETF approvals are coming in 2024.\n\nDencun Upgrade Approaches in January\n\n\n\nEthereum developers are gearing up to implement the so-called \u201cDencun\u201d upgrade that will enable a new blockchain feature called proto-danksharding that is expected to reduce fees for layer-2 scaling protocols and help scale the blockchain by increasing space for data.\n\nAs per a note published on Ethereum\u2019s GitHub repository, the new upgrade will begin testing on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet on the 17th of January, before going live on the Sepolia testnet on the 30th of January and then the Holesky testnet on the 7th of February.\n\nA date for the Dencun upgrade to go live on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet has not yet been announced, but all going well, could presumably be as soon as February.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Can Ether (ETH) Reach $4,000?\n\n\n\nDespite Ether\u2019s year-to-date gains currently sitting in the region of 100%, positive macro, network (i.e. near-term upgrades) and adoption (anticipation for spot Ethereum ETFs) fundamentals suggest risks to the ETH price remain tilted to the upside in the short, medium and longer-term.\n\nTechnicals further add to the bullish picture.\n\nETH has found strong support at the key long-term $2,150 level on multiple occasions in recent weeks whilst also holding to the north of its 21 and 50DMAs, suggestive that the bulls remain in control of the market.\n\nBulls are likely to target a quick move higher towards the key long-term $3,600 area, which marks the April 2022 peak.\n\nThat could mean swift near-term gains of as much as 50% for Ether, taking its recovery back from its 2022 lows to more than 4x.\n\nOnce Ether is able to hit the mid-$3,000s, its assumed that the broader crypto market would be in the throws of a more aggressive bull market and a retest of all-time highs which are close to $5,000 would be increasingly likely.\n\nEther could easily rally above $4,000 in 2024.\n\nETH Alternative to Consider \u2013 Meme Kombat ($MK)\n\n\n\nWhile Ether could offer good upside prospects for the months ahead, traders should always look to diversify their crypto holdings.\n\nFor those with a strong risk tolerance, investing in promising up-and-coming web3 project by buying into their token presales is one good way to generate potential quick exponential gains.\n\nCryptonews.com spends a lot of time analyzing which presales have potential, and one such project that they are big fans of is an exciting new project called Meme Kombat.\n\nMeme Kombat blends together the world of crypto gaming and gambling with its exciting platform where users are able to bet on the outcomes of exciting battles between characters based on some of the crypto world\u2019s most popular meme coins.\n\nEarly $MK investors can also benefit from generous staking rewards, which are currently more than 100% annually.\n\nThe project has already raised close to $5 million, despite launching just weeks ago.\n\nVisit Meme Kombat HereDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin's new proposal would cut Ethereum's security - crypto.news",
        "content": "In a new controversial proposal, Vitalik Buterin suggests decreasing the number of PoS validators from nearly 1 million to just 8,192 to reduce complexity.\n\nIn a new proposal released on Dec. 27, Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a plan to dramatically simplify Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) system to reduce complexity and expand the design possibilities.\n\nThe current PoS system attempts to support decentralization by allowing many validators \u2014 currently almost 900,000. However, Buterin argues that this creates significant complexity, sacrifices, and constraints while still not fully achieving the goal of accessibility for small-scale stakes due to the 32 ETH minimum requirement.\n\nInstead, Buterin proposes reducing the number of signatures per slot to just 8,192 from the current plan of over 1.7 million. This would enable major simplifications across Ethereum, make it much easier to transition to quantum resistance, and retain a cost for attacks between 1-2 million ETH \u2014 which Buterin suggested is high enough:\n\nEven a cost of attack of 1-2 million ETH should be totally sufficient. Vitalik Buterin\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin pitches 3 pathways to simplify Ethereum\u2019s PoS model\n\nDeveloper Micah Zoltu commented on the proposal, noting that this attack cost may be insufficient. According to him, numerous actors dispone this kind of resources and may turn against the protocol sooner or later:\n\nThere are many governments around the world who spend that much on one missile, or one plane. We should be designing systems resilient to state attackers who are willing to spend money to ruin your day. While 1-2 [million] ETH may be enough to deter them from attacking, we have evidence that they will spend far more than this to achieve their goals, and many governments do appear to be heading in the direction of \u201cdestroy crypto\u201d as one of their goals. Of course, I cannot say that 9 [million] ETH is enough either, or maybe both are in fact more than enough! However, I don\u2019t think it is as obvious as you imply that we can safely reduce the security budget. Lindy doesn\u2019t apply to these things, because everything will be fine right up until it isn\u2019t, then it is all very, very bad all of a sudden. Micah Zoltu\n\nThe last part of the statement refers to the Lindy Effect, the theory that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so things that have been around for a long time are more likely to stick around longer.\n\nIn this context, when Zoltu states, \u201cLindy doesn\u2019t apply to these things,\u201d he argues that just because Ethereum\u2019s high level of security has been sufficient so far, it doesn\u2019t mean it will necessarily continue to be sufficient.\n\nButerin outlines three potential approaches to make this reduced signature scheme work: relying entirely on decentralized staking pools, using a two-tiered system with lighter and heavier staking requirements, or rotating participation across slots to retain accountability.\n\nThe proposal has garnered commentary from developers like Zoltu, who questioned whether the reduced 1-2 million ETH attack cost would be sufficient to deter state-level attackers. Buterin acknowledged this was a fair critique, and the optimal cost remains unclear.\n\nThe coming debate around this and other PoS proposals will likely be as vibrant as ever in the Ethereum community.\n\nRead more: Vitalik Buterin unveils major overhaul of Ethereum staking to enhance decentralization\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

It's currently trading hands for $4.11.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd Arbitrum (ARB), which also cuts Ethereum costs and fees, is up by over 16% in 24 hours, coming in priced at $1.50.\n\nMeanwhile MATIC, the 13th biggest digital currency by market cap which runs on Polygon, is up 12% over the day. Its price currently stands at little over a dollar at $1.05.\n\nEthereum scalers speed things up on the notoriously expensive and costly blockchain by settling them on a layer-2 network or sidechain before reporting back to Ethereum. The idea is that developers can build things with ease until Ethereum's congestion issues are potentially sorted through future upgrades.\n\nSuch projects have received renewed interest this year as those wanting to speed up Ethereum have worked hard on building solutions to its slow network.\n\nThe boom in such projects' prices comes at a time when major Ethereum-competitor Solana (SOL) has been on a tremendous run.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThough SOL is up less than 2% today following recent spikes, over the past three months it has surged by over 440%, having made a comeback through November and December. It's now trading above $108 and is by far the biggest gainer among the largest cryptocurrencies over a 90-day period.\n\nElsewhere, Bitcoin (BTC), the biggest digital asset by market cap, is up more than 2% and trading at $43,067.\n\nBut major Bitcoin spinoffs are doing well: Bitcoin SV (BSC) is up nearly 43% in the past day\u2014priced at $68.68\u2014and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently priced at $250.51.

Further, the Ethereum price has successfully recorded a new yearly high by breaching the $2,400 mark during the early trading hours today.\n\nThe ETH price traded in a range between $1,995 and $2,069 for over a week, following which the market gained momentum, and the price broke out of the range. The leader of the altcoins successfully breached its resistance level and jumped over 11%, after which the price faced rejection at $2,300.\n\nTradingView: ETH/USDT\n\nThe ETH coin traded sideways for a while, following which the price regained momentum and recorded a gain of approximately 10%, resulting in the price recording a new yearly high.\n\nHowever, the rally was short-lived as the bulls faced rejection at $2,400.After trading sideways for a while, the market lost momentum and the price experienced a significant correction in value. The ETH coin price then traded in a consolidated range between $2,200 and $2,300 for over two weeks.\n\nRecently, the price successfully regained momentum and jumped over 10%, indicating a rising bullish influence in the crypto space.\n\nWill The Ethereum Price Go Up?\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays a jump in the histogram, indicating an increased buying-over-selling pressure in the market. Moreover, the averages show a sharp rise, highlighting a bullpower in the market.\n\nIf the bulls hold the price above the support level of $2,400, the bulls will prepare to test its resistance level of $2,450 this week. Maintaining the price at that level will set the stage for the Ethereum price to attempt to test its upper resistance level of $2,500 over the weekend.\n\nConversely, if a trend reversal occurs, the price will lose momentum and fall to test its support level of $2,300. Further, if the bears continue to dominate the market, it will result in the coin losing all its gains and plunging to test its lower support level of $2,200."

        "content": "An Ethereum wallet thought to belong to former U.S. President Donald Trump recently moved millions in crypto earned from sales of non-fungible tokens, according to reports from Arkham Intelligence on Dec. 27.\n\nArkham noted that Trump\u2019s wallet began to send his ETH holdings to Coinbase three weeks ago and has moved 1,075 ETH, worth $2.4 million, to the exchange. Arkham added that Trump\u2019s wallet previously held $4 million at its peak.\n\nLive Arkham data shows that Trump currently holds $1.39 million of ETH. He additionally holds $644,000 in MATIC and small amounts of other cryptocurrency tokens for a total of $2.22 million. Arkham\u2019s data additionally indicates that the wallet did not initiate any transfers to exchanges before December.\n\nThough Arkham suggested that Trump is selling the recently transferred holdings, the attached transaction log only shows deposits to Coinbase. The log does not explicitly show that he has sold or converted the funds to another asset.\n\nFunds likely linked to NFT sales\n\nThe crypto wallet in question is believed to belong to Trump based on Arkham Intelligence\u2019s findings. Arkham asserted in August that the wallet belonged to Trump based on information in a financial statement released that month.\n\nForbes India separately reported on Trump\u2019s financial disclosure at the time. The wallet\u2019s balance appears to originate at least in part from Trump\u2019s NFT sales.\n\nSales of the Trump-themed NFTs are conducted through a firm called NFT International LLC. The company claims it does not operate under Trump. However, Trump has been highly involved in promoting the NFTs and has hosted various events for those who purchase the collectibles. He has seemingly collected royalties and revenue from the sales, as explained above.\n\nThe company has so far released three series of NFTs. The latest batch of NFTs attempted to capitalize on Trump\u2019s recent arrest by featuring his mugshot photo. High-quantity purchases included a physical card with pieces of Trump\u2019s suit."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto YouTuber Lark Davis has taken to the Twitter/X social media network to share his view on the enormous all-time high he expects the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, to reach. He has not named any definitive time frames for this surge, though, and just stated that this is a questions of \u201cwhen, not if\u201d.\n\nDavis bets on Ethereum ultimately reaching a mind-blowing $10,000 price tag. To achieve that price milestone, Ethereum would have to showcase a whopping 321.52% from its current price level - $2,370.\n\nEthereum is going to $10,000, when not if! \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 28, 2023\n\nEthereum reaches new milestones\n\nAs reported by the popular on-chain data aggregator Santiment, Ethereum has been moving towards a new record recently, along with the flagship digital currency Bitcoin. Per recent tweet, Ethereum is now within 1.6% of the highest value since May 11 last year. As for Bitcoin, BTC is within 2.9% of the highest value since April 6 last year. Both highs were reached by these two largest cryptocurrencies at the start of December.\n\nBesides, top 10 exchange wallets continue to move Ethereum, according to an earlier tweet published by Santiment as they are withdrawing their ETH into smaller blockchain addresses from centralized crypto exchanges or are moving Ethereum away from CEXs entirely. About two weeks ago, a massive 240,000 ETH was transferred from exchanges. This massive amount of ETH is evaluated at an impressive $569,347,200 at the time of this writing.\n\nGalaxy Digital dumps tonnes of Ethereum\n\nAs reported by U.Today, approximately a week ago, a major cryptocurrency market player, Galaxy Digital investment fund created and spearheaded by former Goldman Sachs partner Mike Novogratz transferred 11,200 Ethereum to the Binance exchange with an apparent goal to sell it. At that time, this ETH lump was worth roughly $24.3 million.\n\nHowever, it was not the only Ethereum transfer made by Novogratz\u2019s company recently. Blockchain sleuth @OnchainDataNerd stated that until that day, Galaxy Digital had deposited 31,437 ETH in total to various cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nMike Novogratz himself is an early Ethereum investor. In one of his interviews, Novogratz stated that he had bought 500,000 ETH from Vitalik Buterin right after the ICO, before Ether began trading on exchanges and was worth less than $1. He was the first even Wall Street buyer of Ethereum back then."

        "content": "News Direct NYC --News Direct-- Everlodge\n\nThe future for crypto still looks bright. Allied Market Research released a report that the cryptocurrency market value is about to triple by 2030, hitting a whopping $4.94 billion. What's fueling this crypto rocket? According to Allied, it's the focus of cryptocurrency on remittances and global payments taking the lead \u2013 put in one word, utility.\n\nFrom all indications, cryptocurrency is gearing up to be a big player in the future of global finance; but that's 7 years away from now according to the AMR. However, in the near term, investors are eager to know what lies ahead in 2024.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the recently emerged presale utility-focused gem, Everlodge, have all demonstrated the potential for substantial returns. While the reasons behind their promising prospects are quite evident, let\u2019s take a quick dive to see why these projects rank among the best crypto investments to consider ahead of 2024.\n\nGrayscale CEO Optimistic on Bitcoin While Crypto Wizard Target Remains $55,000 for Bitcoin in Q1 2024\n\nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein is seeing big potential for Bitcoin (BTC) once the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gives the thumbs up to a spot market BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nIn a recent CNBC interview, Sonnenshein, though not one to throw around price predictions, emphasizes the prevailing optimism in the market. According to him, a substantial number of investors are jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon and integrating it into their portfolios. As we anticipate the potential approval of the ETF, he believes it will be a game-changer, unlocking opportunities for a significant portion of the investment community.\n\nAs per price predictions, analyst Crypto Wizard posted on X, talking about a potential dip in Bitcoin price below the $40k threshold in the weeks ahead. They note that in the event of any deviation from this prediction, a decisive break above $46k for Bitcoin would be the game-changer. Despite these short-term fluctuations, their overall target stands firm at $55k for Bitcoin price by the first quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum Looks Bullish for 2024\n\nThe immense popularity of the Ethereum (ETH) network has positioned it among the leading altcoins in today's market. Its widespread appeal is not the only factor contributing to its positive sentiment; Ethereum also benefits from a history of resilience and market dominance.\n\nWith a current price of $2,230, Ethereum has experienced significant growth in the past month, reaching a peak of around $2,367 to mark the highest point of the year. While the overall bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market may be waning, Ethereum price has managed to remain relatively stable, with a nearly 2% increase over the past week.\n\nHowever, considering the recent drop of over $100 from its peak, investors should be prepared for a potential further correction. Yet, given Ethereum's historical price resilience and strong market presence, it is reasonable to expect a more stable price trajectory leading up to the new year.\n\nEverlodge Has Lofty Plans To Take Charge in Q1 2024\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) emerged as a revolutionary force in the real estate realm, positioned to revolutionize the $280 trillion industry by tackling long-standing challenges. Traditionally, the prohibitively high entry costs, often reaching millions of dollars, combined with a lack of transparency and liquidity, have created barriers for numerous potential investors.\n\nEverlodge's DeFi property marketplace directly confronts these challenges within the travel property sector. Through the innovative approach of listing properties as NFTs on its platform, Everlodge introduces fractionalized ownership, allowing investors to purchase NFT fractions representing a percentage of a property.

        "title": "Ethereum's Dencun Upgrade: Catalyst for Ecosystem Expansion and Price Surge in 2024 - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "The Ethereum network is poised for significant growth in 2024, thanks to the Dencun Upgrade, which aims to enhance network efficiency, scalability, and decrease transaction costs.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, it stands on the cusp of significant growth in 2024. Analysts, including CryptosRUs Analysis , are bullish about Ethereum's future, particularly due to the anticipated Dencun Upgrade. This upgrade is expected to be a game-changer for Ethereum's ecosystem, driving exponential growth through various technical enhancements.\n\nDetails of the Dencun Upgrade\n\nScheduled for early 2024, the Dencun Upgrade represents a pivotal step in Ethereum's development. Initially planned for late 2023, its launch was shifted to 2024 to address complex engineering aspects. The upgrade is set to undergo its first testnet deployment in January, starting with the Goerli test network. This marks a move towards improving layer 2 rollup efficiency and expanding blockchain scalability.\n\nThe Dencun Upgrade focuses on increasing data storage capacity through \"proto-danksharding,\" a process that is key to Ethereum's long-term scalability plans. This upgrade will also enhance the performance of bridges and staking protocols, reduce transaction fees , and limit the use of self-destruct operations on smart contracts.\n\nDuring recent tests, Ethereum demonstrated a 99% participation rate in adopting the changes introduced by the upgrade, and 95% of data \"blobs\" propagated in less than 2 seconds. These technical achievements underline the potential efficiency gains from the Dencun Upgrade.\n\nImpact on Ethereum\u2019s Ecosystem\n\nThe Dencun Upgrade is expected to have a transformative effect on Ethereum's ecosystem. It will increase data availability for layer-2 rollups via proto-danksharding, leading to reduced transaction costs for users. This will optimize gas fees and improve network security, making Ethereum a more scalable and efficient blockchain.\n\nGoldman Sachs notes that Dencun's primary impact will be on enhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability through rollups and setting the stage for future scalability upgrades, including danksharding. This positions Ethereum as a more capable and versatile platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nMarket Outlook and Predictions\n\nAnalysts, including those from CryptosRUs Analysis, forecast a bullish trend for Ethereum in 2024. This optimism is rooted in fundamental factors and technical indicators. The Dencun Upgrade, coupled with the potential approval of a spot ETF for Ethereum, is expected to catalyze significant market growth. CryptosRUs Analysis compares Ethereum\u2019s prospective trajectory with Solana\u2019s recent price action, suggesting a possible bull flag pattern for Ethereum leading into the upgrade.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, is trading at $2,315.75, with a recent 4.15% increase. This price movement, along with the high network activity and growth in NFT trades on Ethereum, indicates strong market interest and potential for further appreciation.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Despite the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has managed to sustain above the $2150 level. This level coincides closely with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level indicating the overall trend of this asset remains bullish. With an intraday gain of 5.3%, the ETH price has just offered a breakout above the resistance trendline which traced the correction trend indicating an early signal of uptrend continuation.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Ain\u2019t Dead: Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Can Outperform Bitcoin in Q1 2024\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs ETH Price Ready to Surpass $2500\n\nThe ETH price breakout from the overhead trendline should release the build-up momentum\n\nThe coin buyers may face potential supply pressure at $2400, followed by $2665\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $12.8 Billion, indicating a 30% gain.\n\nAfter witnessing steady growth from mid-October to early December, the Ethereum price shifted its projection sideways in line with the current market uncertainty. This last three weeks\u2019 consolidation gives a view of price sustainability at higher levels and a short breather per buyers to recuperate the rest of the time.\n\nInterestingly, the ETH price was actively rebounding from two converging trendlines which acted as a dynamic resistance and support. Today, the Ethereum price witnessed a significant inflow, which led to a decisive breakout from the upper trendline in the 4-hour time frame chart.\n\nShould this candle close above the breached level, the buyers would obtain an early signal of uptrend continuation. With sustained buying the ETH price should surpass the last swing high resistance of $2400 to obtain a better confirmation and entry opportunity.\n\nAs per the Fibonacci extension tool, the post-correction rally can chase a potential target of $2665 aligned with the 0.618 FIB level\n\nKey Level to Watch\n\nWhile the current market outlook for Ethereum seems strongly bullish, the coin buyers may face renewed supply pressure at the $2400 mark. In case this resistance triggers another correction, the coin holders can rely on an ascending trendline that has been offering dynamic support to the ETH price for nearly two months. The coin price rebounded several times from the support project the buyers continued to accumulate at market dips, which is a strong signal of an established uptrend. On the contrary, a breakdown below this support would trigger a significant correction in ETH price\n\nBollinger Band: The flattish upper boundary of the Bollinger Band indicator offers an additional layer of resistance at $2400\n\nVortex Indicator: A bullish crossover between the VI+ and VI- slope signals a recovery trend in active."

        "content": "Solana [SOL] generated tremendous hype in 2021, with fans touting its ability to solve the Ethereum [ETH] blockchain's core problem. Solana, it was promised, would be a cheaper and faster place to handle transactions, a better springboard for decentralized finance, or DeFi, and other activities powered by smart contracts.\n\nThen came 2022 and all that pain. Things looked bleak for Solana (and, let's be honest, most of crypto). It didn't help that Sam Bankman-Fried was closely linked to Solana and its SOL token, which sank below $10.\n\nYou're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nSOL was back in the $20s in October as SBF was on trial. Then, all of a sudden, Solana and SOL turned into just about the hottest things going. SOL is above $100 now for the first time since early 2022 and, at $47 billion, it's the fifth-biggest crypto \u2013 and it was briefly fourth-biggest earlier this week.\n\nName Market Capitalization Bitcoin (BTC) $854 billion Ethereum (ETH) $288 billion Tether (USDT) $92 billion BNB $49 billion Solana (SOL) $47 billion XRP $35 billion\n\nMy colleague Danny Nelson cogently summed up recent events this weekend when SOL exceeded $100:\n\nSaturday's price action capped weeks of frenzied trading that have \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 vaulted the Solana blockchain up the leaderboard for on-chain activity. Solana-based decentralized exchanges are nearing Uniswap's multibillion-dollar trading volumes for the first time, according to DefiLlama. Much of that energy is being driven by rampant speculation.\n\nSome of the most popular crypto assets being traded on Solana right now are dog-themed meme coins. But airdrops, too, are prompting droves of traders to test out Solana-based lenders, bridges and other infrastructure.\n\nEthereum remains the leader among layer-1 blockchains that can run smart contracts, aka the bedrock of DeFi. Ethereum has $29 billion of total value locked, a measure of money stashed in a particular blockchain's ecosystem, far exceeding Solana's $1.5 billion, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nBut recent events show Solana may be a serious competitor now.\n\nHere's what else is on my mind in this holiday-shortened week:\n\nA LONG DECADE: The failure amid a hack of Mt. Gox a decade ago was a milestone for the industry, an early sign crypto would need better infrastructure to thrive or, at least, survive. Some 850,000 bitcoins were stolen in that incident, a hoard now worth about $36 billion. All these years later, it appears former customers are starting to get repaid. From CoinDesk's coverage: \"The repayment could have some impact on bitcoin prices, due to the sheer volume of the tokens being released, but would not destablize the market, UBS had said in a report earlier this year.\"\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "The Debate of ETH vs. SOL and the Overlooked Layer 2 Conversation\n\nIn the bustling realm of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), the debate between Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) often garners significant attention. However, an equally pivotal discussion lies in the evolution of Ethereum\u2019s network, particularly its expansion from Layer 1 (L1) to a diverse ecosystem of Layer 2 (L2) solutions. This shift addresses two primary criticisms of Ethereum\u2019s L1: high gas fees and slower transaction speeds.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer 1: The Foundation of Trust and Security\n\nEthereum\u2019s L1 is often criticized for its high gas fees and relatively slower transaction speed. However, it\u2019s crucial to understand that Ethereum\u2019s L1 serves a specific purpose. It acts as a settlement layer, ensuring the highest level of trust and security for large-scale transactions, not typically intended for everyday retail use.\n\nThe Emergence of Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2: A Spectrum of Affordable and Fast Solutions\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum has led to the emergence of various L2 solutions, each offering lower costs and higher transaction speeds. These include:\n\nOptimism and Arbitrum: Focused on scaling Ethereum while ensuring security.\n\nFocused on scaling Ethereum while ensuring security. Polygon: Known for its versatility and wide adoption.\n\nKnown for its versatility and wide adoption. Base, zkSync, and ImmutableX: Offering innovative approaches to scaling and cost reduction, with ImmutableX achieving literally zero gas fees.\n\nOffering innovative approaches to scaling and cost reduction, with ImmutableX achieving literally zero gas fees. Linea and Scroll: New entrants providing additional options for users seeking efficiency.\n\nAll these L2 solutions utilize ETH for gas and settle on Ethereum\u2019s L1, contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem by burning ETH and generating revenue.\n\nThe Misconception of Ethereum\u2019s Inefficiency\n\nIt\u2019s a misconception to claim Ethereum as a whole is plagued by high gas costs and slow speeds. The high-cost, slower L1 is designed for specific use cases, while retail activity increasingly moves to the more efficient L2s, especially during the bear market.\n\nSecurity, Decentralization, and Specialization: The L2 Advantage\n\nL2s are not just about lower fees and faster transactions. They experiment with various levels of security, decentralization, and specialization, adding richness to the Ethereum network. This experimentation includes the development of new technologies like the SVM, MOVE, and fully private chains.\n\nInteroperability: The Bridge to a Unified Network\n\nCritics often point to the poor user experience of bridging between networks and the fracturing of liquidity. However, advancements in interoperability, like Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), intentions-based bridges, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), are paving the way for seamless integration between these networks. This integration hints at a future where specialized chains operate harmoniously, enhancing the user experience.\n\nConclusion: Ethereum\u2019s Transformation into a Network of Networks\n\nEthereum\u2019s evolution into a network of networks, rather than a single shared state, aligns with the broader vision of a modular, interconnected blockchain ecosystem. This development not only addresses the limitations of its L1 but also opens up a world of possibilities for users and developers alike.\n\nTL;DR: Ethereum\u2019s expansion from Layer 1 to a diverse Layer 2 ecosystem addresses its high gas fees and slower speeds, offering a range of solutions with varying costs, speeds, and features. This evolution transforms Ethereum into a flexible, secure, and interconnected network, paving the way for a more efficient and user-friendly blockchain experience."

        "content": "Data shows Ethereum was the most exploited DeFi chain in 2023 by the amount lost.\n\nBNB Chain was also heavily exploited by hackers this year.\n\nPrior year data shows that BNB Chain suffered the biggest dollar losses.\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) has changed the game by opening access to financial services without an intermediary. However, a recent tweet from Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp stated that $1.95 billion was lost to DeFi exploits in 2023, down slightly from 2022, which put total DeFi losses for that year at $2.075 billion, according to security firm SlowMist.\n\nDeFi protocols are vulnerable to loss due to the open and immutable nature of the smart contracts that underpin DeFi. However, different protocols seem more susceptible to attack than others, as evidenced by 70% of 2023\u2019s DeFi losses occurring on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nCybercriminals Favor Ethereum\n\nAccording to Lopp\u2019s uncited data source, 2023 DeFi losses occurred mostly on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchains, totaling $1.35 billion and $110.1 million, respectively.\n\nAlthough the biggest total dollar loss was attributed to Ethereum, which accounted for nearly 70% of the $1.95 billion total loss in 2023, the highest number of incidents occurred on BSC at 213. This indicates attackers exploit BSC more frequently but can extract less money on average than the DeFi market leader.\n\nEthereum and Binance Smart Chain experienced the most DeFi security incidents by far in 2023. pic.twitter.com/ZS9ZqNKBww \u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) December 28, 2023\n\nAccording to DeFiLlama, 2023\u2019s biggest single DeFi hack was a database attack on Mixin, netting hackers $200 million in September. The Mixin Network is a trading network that connects different blockchains to its own multi-chain network. It was noted that Mixin was not mentioned in Lopp\u2019s data source.\n\nWhile 2023 was damaging to Ethereum\u2019s reputation, BSC DeFi protocols were heavily targeted by hackers in 2022.\n\n2022 DeFi Hacks\n\nData on DeFi hacks compiled by SlowMist showed 183 security incidents last year, totaling a loss of $2.075 billion. Unlike the current year, BNB Chain held the highest number of breaches at 79 and the biggest loss of any chain at $785 million.\n\nDeFi security incidents by chain per SlowMist.\n\nBinance rebranded Binance Smart Chain to BNB Chain in February 2022, but many still interchange the two names.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nLopp did not attribute the 2023 DeFi hack data source, making it difficult to review the methodology.\n\nDifferent sources may use varying standards and criteria to calculate data on DeFi loss es .\n\nEthereum\u2019s 2023 $1.35 billion DeFi loss represents around 4.6% of the blockchain\u2019s current value locked in ETH DeFi protocols.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nAlthough the majority of DeFi losses in 2023 occurred on Ethereum, the issue of DeFi security spans the entire crypto industry. Failure to address the issue jeopardizes future growth until trust can be established through better practices such as stricter oversight and improved code auditing.\n\nRead about Arthur Hayes\u2019 recent Ethereum price prediction here:\n\nHayes Ditches Solana for Ethereum, Citing $5K \u201cProphecy\u201d\n\n\n\nFind out more on the evidence that supports Craig Wright\u2019s Satoshi claim here:\n\nBitcoin SV Pumps as Wright Boosts Satoshi Legitimacy Claims"

        "content": "A closely followed crypto analyst believes that one Ethereum (ETH) challenger is gearing up for a breakout rally on the way to printing gains of about 200%.\n\nTrader Ali Martinez tells his 37,800 followers on the social media platform X that the smart contract platform Fantom (FTM) appears to be forming a large bullish reversal pattern on the weekly chart.\n\nAccording to Martinez, a move above the pattern\u2019s resistance will trigger a rally that can send the altcoin to a level last seen in April 2022.\n\n\u201cFantom appears to form a \u2018W\u2019 pattern on its weekly chart. If FTM sustains a weekly close above $0.57, it will confirm this bullish formation and march toward $1.60!\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, FTM is trading for $0.532.\n\nThe trader is also closely following the price action of the iris biometric cryptocurrency project Worldcoin (WLD). According to the analyst, WLD is now trading above the diagonal resistance of a bullish continuation pattern.\n\n\u201cWorldcoin shows signs of a breakout from a bull flag on its four-hour chart! If confirmed, this could pave the way for WLD to enter an 80% rally, targeting $6.30.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, WLD is trading at $3.67, down over 5% in the last 24 hours but still above the analyst\u2019s diagonal resistance.\n\nLooking at the blockchain-based gaming ecosystem The Sandbox (SAND), the analyst thinks that the altcoin is poised to move higher after moving a resistance level based on the number of wallets holding SAND at key price levels.\n\n\u201cThe Sandbox above $0.55 presents a bullish opportunity! With a clear path ahead and no major resistance, SAND could aim higher. The next critical resistance wall is between $0.90 and $1.35, where 23,000 addresses hold 447 million SAND.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, SAND is worth $0.61.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A trader who accurately called the bottom of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2018 bear market thinks that the uptrend of one Ethereum (ETH) challenger that has massively outperformed the broader crypto markets this year is far from over.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 233,400 followers on the social media platform X that the people who are calling for the end of Solana\u2019s (SOL) big rally this year will most likely miss out on the altcoin\u2019s surge to a fresh all-time high (ATH).\n\nAccording to Bluntz, Solana has a lot more gas left in the tank as he predicts that SOL could still print gains of more than 257% from current levels.\n\n\u201cSOL is still 113% away from ATH. Why is everyone so hell-bent on calling tops? What the f**k is wrong with y\u2019all?\n\nJust buy dips all the way to $400.\n\nNot a single person is ever going to remember the guy who may or may not have been successful in shorting a 10% move down, but they will remember the chads who long all the way to inevitable all-time highs.\n\nDon\u2019t overthink it, SOL is this cycle\u2019s darling chain, embrace it.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is worth $112, up more than 1,000% from this year\u2019s opening price of $9.99.\n\nLooking at the low time frame charts of Solana, the trader thinks that the altcoin is poised for another leg up against both the US dollar and Bitcoin (SOL/BTC).\n\n\u201cNice little 12% dip there on SOL in a monster uptrend with a few more legs to go in my opinion on the BTC pair and USD pair. Don\u2019t fight the trend.\u201d\n\nBluntz uses the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis in an attempt to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave uptrend to be followed by an ABC correction before the next leg up.\n\nLooking at the analyst\u2019s SOL/USD pair, he seems to suggest that the pair is in a position to rally once more after completing an ABC correction. For the SOL/BTC pair, he appears to predict that it could rise above 0.0034 BTC, worth $144.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The leading smart contract platform by volume is seeing a rise in price after its co-founder shared a proposal to simplify its proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.\n\nIn a new thread, Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin releases his proposal on how to improve the top altcoin\u2019s blockchain, saying that it would make the proof-of-stake system \u201cconsiderably simpler and lighter.\u201d\n\nIn the proposal, Buterin says that the upgrade would boost decentralization and allow regular individuals to partake in staking. However, he notes that the proposal comes at a high cost.\n\n\u201cThis approach requires the Ethereum chain to process a huge number of signatures (~28,000 today; 1,790,000 post-SSF [single slot finality]) per slot, which is a very high load. Supporting this load entails a lot of technical sacrifices.\u201d\n\nAccording to Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s centralization works against it because if it were to suffer an attack, it would cost the network about 9 million tokens, or $20 billion.\n\n\u201cIf a 51% attack takes place [on Ethereum], a large fraction of the entire attacking validator set has their deposits slashed. The cost of an attack is at present around 9 million ETH (~$20 billion), and that assumes network synchrony breaks in a way that maximally favors the attacker. I argue that this is a high cost, but it is too high a cost, and we can afford to make some sacrifices in the matter\u2026\n\nThis is why I advocate a moderate solution: one that makes some sacrifices on validator accountability, but still keeps the amount of total slashable ETH quite high, but in exchange gets us most of the benefits of a smaller validator set.\u201d\n\nButerin concludes that the optimal number of signatures to process per slot for ETH is 8192 as it would make it \u201cmuch easier for anyone to run a consensus client, and users, staking enthusiasts and others would be able to immediately work off of that assumption.\u201d\n\nAfter the announcement, the price of Ethereum jumped to $2,442. However, it has since stabilized and is trading for $2,370 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum is experiencing a resurgence. After a period of underperformance that saw its price and comparative value to Bitcoin decline, Ethereum is showing signs of a bullish resurgence, regaining its footing in the crypto market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recent downtrend in ETHUSD had led many investors to consider Ethereum an underbought asset, slapping the label \"beta play\" on it, suggesting it was a less volatile, less rewarding investment compared to its peers. This perception is now being challenged as Ethereum demonstrates strength and growth potential, with its price incrementally rising against both USD and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile Ethereum gains momentum, its competitor, Solana, is observed to be relinquishing much of its previously accumulated value, highlighting the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets.\n\nThe shifting focus towards Ethereum may be partly attributed to the increasing interest in Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. These platforms promise to address Ethereum's scalability and high transaction fee issues, which have been significant concerns for users and developers.\n\nAs the Ethereum network continues to be the primary choice for decentralized applications, the enhancement of its scalability and efficiency through Layer 2 solutions could significantly support its attractiveness and utility, driving further adoption and investment.\n\nLayer 2 solutions have become increasingly critical as they allow Ethereum to scale effectively by handling transactions off the main chain (Layer 1), thus alleviating congestion and reducing fees. The successful implementation and adoption of these solutions are crucial for Ethereum's long-term viability as a smart contract platform, especially as it faces stiff competition from rivals that offer cheaper user experience.\n\nAs Ethereum's price shows a positive trajectory, there is a cautious optimism among investors that this could be the beginning of a bullish trend. However, the overall market sentiment remains subject to various external factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the blockchain space.\n\nSolana slows down\n\nSolana has been emerging as a notable contender among the array of digital assets. However, recent trends indicate a cooling phase for the asset, particularly in the context of its pricing dynamics and ecosystem growth.\n\nVenture Capitals (VCs), renowned for their strategic investments and market influence, have played a pivotal role in the pricing volatility observed in Solana. Initially, VCs were significant proponents of the Solana ecosystem, recognizing its potential for high throughput and efficient transaction capabilities. This support resulted in a substantial influx of capital which, combined with speculative interest from retail investors, propelled Solana to new heights.\n\nHowever, the very nature of venture capital investments involves calculated entry and exit strategies. As Solana's prices soared, VCs began to capitalize on their investments, introducing considerable selling pressure in the market. This is not a development unique to Solana; it's a prevalent cycle seen across various cryptocurrency platforms where after substantial appreciation, investors seek to realize profits.\n\nRetail investors, on the other hand, often find themselves riding the wave of enthusiasm. The proliferation of memecoins within the Solana ecosystem, which delivered exponential returns in a short span, is a testament to this fervor. However, the staggering returns were also accompanied by heightened risks, including projects with inadequate security measures, leading to 'rug pulls' and market manipulations.\n\nAs the market begins to assimilate these risks, a natural retreat occurs. Retail investors, learning from the market's punitive lessons, start to engage in profit-taking. This behavior is partly defensive, a safeguard against the anticipated surge in selling pressure from VCs and a measure to secure gains from the speculative frenzy that had become all too common.\n\nMoreover, the cooling off of Solana's ecosystem is reflected in its capitalization metrics. The excessive heat, characterized by the meteoric rise of memecoins and the influx of speculative capital, has diminished. The market has started to recalibrate, aligning more closely with fundamental valuations rather than the speculative momentum that previously drove demand."

        "title": "What is a spot ETH ETF: is an Ethereum ETF approval next? - OKX",
        "content": "As the excitement of BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF builds, we're seeing increased speculation about what crypto-themed exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be next. Chief among these rumors is how a spot Ether (ETH) ETF might be next given its popularity among institutions and retail traders. As the cryptocurrency with the second-highest market cap in the crypto space, a spot ETH ETF may certainly be on the cards once the spot BTC ETF is fully approved by regulators. Curious about the likelihood of a spot ETH ETF coming to fruition? From understanding what a spot ETF is to highlighting the pros and cons of trading a spot Ether ETF, here's everything you'll need to know when it comes to navigating through the volatility accompanied by the possibilities of a spot Ether ETF announcement.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nConceived in 2013, Ethereum is a popular decentralized blockchain platform with smart contract utility. It revolutionized the crypto world by introducing self-governing smart contracts, allowing users to create and execute automated agreements. Ethereum's ecosystem thrives on the Ether (ETH) cryptocurrency, which acts as a fee for transactions and powers a diverse range of decentralized applications (DApps) like DeFi lending platforms and NFT marketplaces. These DApps operate without a central authority, opening up new possibilities across various fields.\n\nWhy is Ethereum so popular?\n\nAmong the various altcoins in the crypto space, Ethereum shines as a particularly captivating ecosystem for both retail and institutional crypto traders. Given its decade of growth and influence within the crypto space, Ethereum has certainly stood the test of time as it stands shoulders above other altcoins that were conceived in the early 2010s. As the first platform to pull off smart contracts without a hitch, Ethereum has achieved numerous feats that include introducing the first-ever NFT standard in 2018 and making a full transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake as part of the Ethereum Merge. These milestones combined with the fervent Ethereum community and extensive number of DApps in the Ethereum ecosystem make Ethereum a powerhouse in the crypto space.\n\nNow that we understand what Ethereum is and why it's so popular, let's dive into the fundamentals of a potential spot ETH ETF.\n\nWhat is a spot ETH ETF?\n\nAlso known as a physically-backed Ether ETF, the spot ETH ETF resembles traditional exchange-traded funds, where institutions managing the ETF commit to purchasing ETH and holding ETH in their reserves. The ETF is then listed on a traditional stock exchange and issues shares representing ownership of the ETF. This effectively means traders gain exposure to the underlying ETH held in the institution's reserves when trading the spot ETH ETF.\n\nOne key thing to take note of when trading the spot ETH ETF is that owning shares of a spot ETH ETF doesn't directly grant ownership of individual ETH tokens held by the institution. Shareholders hold claims on the value of the ETH holdings, not the Ether itself. Additionally, while institutions hold the underlying ETH, they may utilize various strategies to manage it, such as lending it out or using it for staking, to potentially generate additional returns for the ETF.\n\nWho is the spot ETH ETF for?\n\nMany believe that the spot ETH ETF will be perfect for TradFi traders who are used to trading stocks and ETFs on traditional brokerages. While directly trading Ether has its charm, it's not for everyone given the inaccessibility and numerous barriers to entry that cryptocurrencies are known for. That's where spot ETH ETFs comes in. As setting up wallets, navigating exchanges, and managing private keys can sometimes feel alien and complex, spot ETH ETFs will ease traders who are more familiar with TradFi in gaining exposure to ETH. By trading spot ETH ETFs, traders with little to no experience in crypto can gain convenient exposure to ETH's price movements without needing a cryptocurrency wallet or dealing with the intricacies of directly buying and storing ETH.\n\nHow does a spot ETH ETF work?\n\nConfused about how a spot ETH ETF works? Think of the spot ETH ETF as a pool where traders contribute funds to buy ETH. This pool then tracks the price of Ether by holding the coins directly. When the price of Ethereum rises, the value of the ETF shares goes up proportionally, and vice versa. This is distinct from ETH futures-based ETFs, which track ETH's price through derivatives like ETH futures without holding the underlying asset.\n\nTo keep pace with the constantly fluctuating price of ETH, the ETF manager works behind the scenes to monitor the market and adjust the ETF's ETH holdings as needed. This typically involves creation and redemption units, which are large blocks of shares exchanged for the underlying Ether. This delicate balancing act aims to ensure your ETF shares accurately reflect the real-time market value of Ethereum, though slight differences can occur due to factors like trading costs and rebalancing schedules.\n\nAdvantages of trading spot ETH ETFs\n\nLowering the barrier to entry to gaining crypto exposure\n\nAs mentioned above, crypto can be hard to get into because of the numerous points for potential friction that will deter anyone new to crypto trading. This can range from fumbling during the Know Your Customer process to choosing the right spot pair to trade the crypto you want. With the spot ETH ETF, traders who already have trading accounts with established TradFi brokerages can simply look up the ticker for the spot ETH ETF and trade it as they normally would with any other forex pair or stock.\n\nBeing open to institutional traders\n\nIf a spot ETH ETF gets approved, trading ETH will become even more accessible from an institutional perspective. As institutions like pension funds and asset managers may have specific regulations that prevent them from trading Ether and other coins directly, smart money has long been barred off from gaining exposure to cryptocurrencies. With a spot ETH ETF, they might have a better chance of being allowed to trade it as it's an SEC-approved trading vehicle.\n\nNew ways to trade ETH\n\nOn top of traders buying and selling shares of spot ETH ETFs, traders can also consider alternative methods of trading spot ETH ETF shares. This can range from short-selling it to the downside if they're intending to hedge their overall portfolio or are bearish about Ether to executing options strategies like covered calls to generate additional gains on their spot ETH ETF holdings. Such alternatives will inject a fresh amount of liquidity into the crypto market as more traders gain exposure to Ether through trading the spot ETH ETF.\n\nDisadvantages of trading spot ETH ETFs\n\nETF expense ratios\n\nFor those new to trading ETFs, one thing to take note of is expense ratios, which measures how much of a fund's assets are used for administrative and other operating expenses. While the exact ratio is yet to be known since no spot ETH ETFs have been approved as of the time of writing, we can take Bitcoin futures ETFs for reference. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF has an expense ratio of 0.95%. This is considerably higher compared to other ETFs and mutual funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, which has an expense ratio of 0.03%. As this is an annualized fee that compounds over the length of time that traders hold the ETF, overall gains earned from trading the spot ETH ETF will definitely be impacted.\n\nETH ownership\n\nAs previously mentioned, share traders technically don't own the Ether since it's managed by the spot ETH ETF manager, who could potentially be lending out or staking the ETH for extra yield. This brings into question concerns of true ownership, since \"not your keys, not your coins\" is a mantra that many crypto natives swear by. This could be a major concern if the ETF liquidates its assets and closes down the line.\n\nThe limitation of regular trading hours\n\nCrypto markets are famous for being available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about spot ETH ETFs, whose shares are subject to the regular trading hours of when a typical stock market opens and closes. Due to this limitation, traders could potentially miss out on potential opportunities during times when the stock market is closed.\n\nIs a spot ETH ETF approval coming?\n\nAs the spot BTC ETF is close to getting approved, bullish ETH traders can't help but wonder when a spot ETH ETF might be available for trading. This speculation further intensified when institutions like BlackRock and ARK Invest proceeded to officially file for spot ETH ETF approvals. Unfortunately, the Securities and Exchange Commission has put these expectations to a halt as they've recently delayed its decision to May 2024. While this might've dampened the hopes of spot ETH ETF traders, many are still holding onto the hope that the spot BTC ETF approval will set a precedent for the crypto scene and lead to the eventual approval of many more spot crypto ETFs.\n\nShould you buy Ether instead?\n\nAlthough spot ETH ETF shares may offer convenience that's considered useful for traders, the truth is that owning spot ETH ETF shares differs greatly from owning Ether directly. That raises the question \u2014 why not just buy ETH itself? To dissect this question further, it's important to consider your priorities and goals as a trader. If you're a trader that's inexperienced with trading crypto and simply want exposure to Ethereum, trading spot ETH ETF shares may be perfect for you. However, if you're a trader that prioritizes ownership and freedom to trade at whatever timing, then the spot ETH ETF might not be suitable for you.\n\nFinal words and next steps\n\nSpot ETH ETFs offer a compelling bridge between the allure of Ethereum and the familiarity of TradFi. Its availability as an option for traders represents a significant step forward in making Ethereum accessible to a wider audience. By simplifying access to crypto and allowing for diversification of trading portfolios, the spot ETH ETF opens the world of crypto to a whole new audience. Although trading shares of the spot ETH ETF comes with its own set of risks and disadvantages, it undoubtedly has its popularity among traders with specific trading preferences.\n\nKeen to give trading Ether directly a go? Check out our ETH spot trading pairs and ETH price page for more information.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about spot ETH ETFs\n\nIs a spot ETH ETF the same as a spot BTC ETF?\n\nWhile both spot ETFs are tracking the price of their respective cryptocurrencies, they're similar in that they're spot ETFs that'll hold actual ETH and BTC should the ETFs be approved. This will impact their overall price action as compared to futures ETFs, which deal with derivatives of the cryptocurrencies instead of the actual coin.\n\nCan I lose money with a spot ETH ETF?\n\nAs with any crypto trade, this could definitely happen. Since the price of Ether is volatile, your ETH ETF shares can go down in value as the ETF is meant to track the price of ETH.\n\nHow do I choose the right spot ETH ETF?\n\nWhen comparing among the different ETH ETFs, it's key to consider factors like expense ratios, underlying ETH holdings, and assets under management.\n\nWhat happens if the SEC rejects spot ETH ETFs?\n\nIf rejected, it could delay wider adoption but wouldn't necessarily eliminate the possibility of future approval. If you're planning to trade ETH based on this, it's important to stay informed about regulatory developments.\n\nCan I just buy Ether instead of the spot ETH ETF?\n\nYes, you might find buying ETH more convenient if you're already a crypto native. In our opinion, the spot ETH ETF has a different target audience and makes it easier for TradFi traders to gain exposure to the Ethereum ecosystem."

        "content": "An address associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump has likely sold over $2.4 million worth of ETH.\n\nDespite the overall bullish state of the crypto market, a blockchain address associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be selling a large amount of Ether (ETH). In the past three weeks, data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence shows that the wallet transferred 1,075 ETH to Coinbase.\n\nIf the transferred amount was likely sold for USD as assumed, then the wallet may have realized around $2.4 million. Nevertheless, a less likely outcome is that the large volume of ETH may have been moved to Coinbase to maximize staking yield.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump-associated address still holds around 589.5 ETH (worth approximately $1.4 million) and 273.7 Wrapped Ether (ETH) valued at roughly $650,000). The ETH position represents the majority of the wallet\u2019s holdings.\n\nAt its most recent peak value in early December, the wallet held around $4 million in crypto assets. However, the recent transfers to Coinbase mean the address now holds just $2.2 million worth of cryptocurrencies.\n\nDonald Trump and Crypto\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump was a vocal crypto critic during his time in office. However, following his replacement in early 2021, the former president appears to have a changed stance. Donald Trump has a team set up to monetize his enigmatic character and history through the sale of NFTs.\n\nThe Trump NFT team evidently controls the blockchain address now tied to the former U.S. President. A significant portion of the ETH recently transferred to Coinbase represents royalties realized from holders trading Trump NFTs, hence the suggestion the Trump team may have liquidated the assets.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump is still in the race to become U.S. President at the 2024 polls. If the former President realizes his ambitions, the United States might usher in its first national leader with direct ties to the crypto and NFT space."

Discover SCENE\n\nBlast, an upcoming Ethereum layer-2 scaling network from the creator of leading NFT marketplace Blur, has now pulled in more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of deposits from users vying to earn yield and points towards an upcoming token airdrop.\n\nSome $1.13 billion worth of cryptocurrency has been deposited into the Blast bridge as of this writing, according to both the official website and DeFiLlama, making it the 23rd largest protocol by total value locked according to the latter resource. Over 86,000 users have contributed funds thus far.\n\nAccording to Blast, users are earning about a 4% annual return on deposited Ethereum (ETH) and 5% on stablecoins. Furthermore, they\u2019re earning \u201cBlast Points,\u201d which will play into their respective share of the upcoming BLAST token airdrop.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the Blast website, the airdrop is set for May 2024.\n\nBlast aims to make an impact in the crowded Ethereum scaling market\u2014which includes networks like Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base\u2014by incentivizing users with both native yield on staked cryptocurrency along with a share of tokens via airdrops. Crypto protocols use airdrops to give out tokens to early users and contributors, typically aiding in decentralized governance as well.\n\nPulling in users with the allure of token rewards is the same strategy that worked wonders for Blur, which dethroned one-time leader OpenSea to become the leading NFT marketplace in February. Blur has airdropped more than $800 million worth of BLUR tokens to NFT traders in 2023 across two waves, based on the peak value of the token, per data from CoinGecko.\n\nBoth Blast and Blur were founded by Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre, and both were backed by prominent crypto venture capital firm Paradigm. However, Blast\u2019s rollout has been controversial\u2014even for its backers.\n\nUsers are depositing cryptocurrency into a bridge that does not currently connect to the actual Blast network that\u2019s in development, and funds cannot be withdrawn until February 2024. The overt emphasis on earning yield and rewards before the network is even live has apparently rubbed some crypto users the wrong way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn late November, just days after Blast was revealed to the world, Paradigm Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson wrote that the firm believed that the \u201cannouncement crossed lines in both messaging and execution.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the bridge before the L2, or not to allow withdrawals for three months, since we think it sets a bad precedent for other projects,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe also think much of the marketing cheapens the work of a serious team.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on. That said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution. For example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the\u2026 \u2014 Dan Robinson (@danrobinson) November 26, 2023\n\nBlast and Pacman did not respond to the comments. However, in advance of Robinson\u2019s tweet, Pacman wrote that Paradigm had not been involved in Blast\u2019s go-to-market rollout, and that the VC firm\u2014which co-led Blast\u2019s $20 million raise\u2014had already asked the Blast team to make some changes.\n\nHe added that Paradigm\u2019s suggestions were \u201cunder active consideration,\u201d but that it would ultimately be Blast\u2019s call.\n\nIn December, Robinson tweeted that Paradigm had worked with Blast to develop a \u201cnew time-locked upgrade system,\u201d which he said would \u201cset a better precedent for future projects who may try to emulate them.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "In a new blog post, Buterin offers three approaches to simplify the network\u2019s high validator load.\n\nBy: Pedro Solimano \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin published a blog post today proposing to reduce the network\u2019s load associated with its high validator count. The number of validators reaches roughly 895,000.\n\nThis high figure supports decentralization\u2013allowing even regular individuals to participate in staking\u2013but strains the network due to the huge number of signatures it has to process.\n\nAccording to Buterin, the load and technical complexity is currently too high, and needs addressing.\n\nEther is posting a green day, surging 6.1% to $2,363 in the past 24 hours, according to Coingecko.\n\nButerin reckons that the current signature aggregation system\u2013which processes roughly 28,000 signatures per slot\u2013breeds systemic complexity and doesn\u2019t reach the end goal of allowing anybody to stake.\n\n\u201cIt seems infeasible to make an everyone-signs-in-every-slot system truly enable staking for the average person in the long term: if Ethereum has 500 million users, and 10% of them stake, then that implies 100 million signatures per slot,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nEthereum Slots\n\nA slot refers to a unit of time in the Ethereum network. A time period of 12 seconds is given for the network to choose a random validator to propose a block to the slot.\n\nEthereum\u2019s co-founder considers sticking to 8,192 signatures per slot (in lieu of the current 28,000) moving forward would reduce the technical complexities that the network currently grapples with.\n\nButerin\u2019s Three Approaches\n\nProposing three approaches to broach the issue, Buterin starts off with going all-in on decentralized staking pools. This would require raising the minimum deposit size to 4,096 ETH, incentivizing small-staker to join these pools.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha? Become a premium member of The Defiant and join our DeFi Alpha community. Start for free\n\nButerin\u2019s second approach is to create two layers of stakers. A \u201cheavy\u201d layer with the aforementioned 4,096 ETH which participates in finality, and a second \u201clighter\u201d layer (with no minimum) that offers an additional coat of security.\n\nAttacks should be less prevalent, since both layers would need to be corrupted, but it would also make staking less egalitarian by \u201censhrining\u201d a divide between cohorts.\n\nHis final approach is rotating communities, chosen from the current pool of active validators and adjusted every slot for increased security.\n\nThe main drawback, however, is that it increases protocol complexity. Meanwhile, it preserves solo staking in a recognizable form, allows a one-class system, and even allows for the minimum deposit size to be reduced to a very low level (eg. 1 ETH).\n\nTaking a Load Off\n\nThe developer insists that 8,192 signatures makes the technical complexities presently plaguing the network much lower.\n\n\u201cIt becomes much easier for anyone to run a consensus client, and users, staking enthusiasts and others would be able to immediately work off of that assumption,\u201d he wrote, concluding that \u201cThe future load of the Ethereum protocol becomes no longer unknown.\u201d\n\nNow, the community must grapple with which approach to implement.\n\n\n\n"

This kind of behavior is expected before a major event that can have a considerable impact on the price action, and in the crypto market\u2019s case, it is the upcoming spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nEthereum price sees another bout of growth\n\nEthereum price trading at $2,433 recently breached a crucial resistance level marked at $2,334. This price point is key to a historically known bullish pattern called the inverse head and shoulder formation.\n\nThe Head and shoulder formation generally signals a bearish outcome, but this pattern does the opposite. Inverse head and shoulders is a reversal pattern that is formed by three consecutive lows along with two intermediate highs. The first and third lows are called shoulders, located approximately at the same level above the second low \u2013 the head. Another important line is the one drawn along the intermediate highs \u2013 the neckline.\n\nThe pattern is completed only when the right shoulder rises above the neckline, suggesting that further rallying will be akin to the height of the head.\n\nIn the case of ETH, the height of the head marks a $218 growth, placing the target at $218 above $2,334. This brings the expected rise to $2,551, marking a 9.3% growth. Since, on the 8-hour chart, Ethereum price has already satisfied the pattern with the breach of the neckline, there is room for further growth.\n\nETH/USD 8-hour chart\n\nTrading at $2,433, ETH could still rise by another 5% before reaching the target price, breaching which would set the altcoin up for an increase to $3,000.\n\nPrice indicators, Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), are both exhibiting room for bullishness.\n\nEthereum RSI and MACD\n\nHowever, a failed breach of the target price could bring ETH back down to $2,400, which could happen if short-term traders look for profit-taking as well, invalidating the bullish thesis."

Slashing is a mechanism put in place to enforce good validator behavior.\n\nButerin suggested three potential approaches: relying entirely on decentralized staking pools, a two-tiered system with \u201cheavy\u201d and \u201clight\u201d staking, and rotating participation with accountable committees.\n\nThe proposed solutions aim to reduce the digital signature load to a manageable level.\n\nCalculations for a rotating participation method.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum scaling solutions have been the focal point for both users and developers in the Ethereum ecosystem. Cofounder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin recently made an affirming statement about the progress of Ethereum's scaling solutions, specifically rollups. His commendation of one project reaching stage 1 and optimism for others approaching this milestone highlights the strides being made in enhancing Ethereum's capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA rollup is a layer-2 solution that executes transactions outside the Ethereum mainnet (layer 1) but posts transaction data on it. This approach allows the network to handle more transactions per second, mitigating congestion and potentially lowering fees. The classification of these rollups into stages \u2013 from 0 to 2 \u2013 is crucial for assessing their maturity and functionality.\n\nVitalik: I'm really happy we have one unambiguously stage 1 rollup (Arbitrum One) and a couple more very-close-to-stage-1 rollups this year. Let's get to ten stage 1 rollups and some degree of sequencer decentralization in the next year. https://t.co/yiGfKwea9Q pic.twitter.com/zd8zrGigo7 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 28, 2023\n\nStage 1 is a significant achievement for any rollup. It indicates a fully operational proof system, the ability for at least five external participants to submit fraud proofs, permissionless exits for users, and the establishment of a security council. Arbitrum One's achievement of this stage demonstrates its capability to support Ethereum's scalability securely and reliably.\n\nHowever, Buterin's call to action for 10 stage-1 rollups within the next year, along with some degree of sequencer decentralization, is both ambitious and necessary. Sequencer decentralization would ensure that the ordering of transactions is not controlled by a single party, which is critical for maintaining the trustless and decentralized ethos of blockchain technology.\n\nThe drive for stage-1 rollups brings both advantages and challenges. On the upside, a greater number of stage-1 rollups would increase Ethereum's throughput significantly, thereby supporting more users and applications. It could also drive down transaction costs and improve user experience, making Ethereum more competitive in the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nOn the flip side, the rapid scaling of rollups must not compromise security or decentralization. The complexity of establishing a reliable security council and the rigorous requirements to enable multiple entities to submit fraud proofs are nontrivial."

This is suggested by BlockchainCenter\u2019s Ethereum rainbow price chart, reflecting momentum in the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn particular, specific cryptocurrency traders and investors leverage Ethereum\u2019s rainbow chart to analyze the historical trends of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. They examine its relationship with various moving averages (MAs) and identify patterns that can inform more informed investment decisions.\n\nThe chart indicates that Ethereum is presently situated in the \u2018Still Cheap\u2019 phase, represented by the light green color. It fluctuates within the range of $1,597 to $2,306, residing below the \u2018Hold\u2019 yellow zone spanning $2,302 to $3,342, based on information observed by Finbold on December 27.\n\nEthereum rainbow price chart. Source: BlockchainCenter\n\nProjection for January 1, 2024\n\nAs for the start of the following year, no significant fluctuations in price are expected, as Ethereum is treading the fine line between the \u2018Still Cheap\u2019 and \u2018Hold\u2019 territories, which both present a buying opportunity for investors.\n\nHowever, an alternative Ethereum Rainbow Chart tool created by CoinCodex projects that, under identical circumstances, the asset price could linger at approximately $3,033 per token should ETH stay within the \u2018HODL\u2019 zone in January 2024.\n\nEthereum rainbow price chart.

They are all effectively under heavy \u201cre-staking\u201d incentives not to withhold data or mess with the state root between the chains,\u201d his post reads.\n\nWhile Yakovenko\u2019s initial post on the subject was shared on December 25, media reports failed to see the initial ironic intention behind the post. By all means, Solana is bigger as a protocol when compared to the next capitalized Ethereum L2, Polygon and it has a thriving ecosystem that will undoubtedly prevent it from staying under the shadows of Ethereum.\n\nOver the past few months, there have been a lot of controversial community talks between members of the Solana and Ethereum communities in which some of the former try to elevate their technologies over the latter. This narrative was deepened as Solana started flipping Ethereum in key performance metrics.\n\nYakovenko has time and again tried to caution the community against such narratives and this latest post might be another way to show both can co-exist.\n\nEqual Ecosystem Criticism\n\nWithin the space of 2 weeks, the duo of Ethereum and Solana have faced intense criticism from some market analysts who took out time to highlight the flaws of both protocols.\n\nPeter Brandt recently took on Ethereum, noting that he has shorted the coin as he believes it is on its way to a low of $650. He based his bearish assumptions on the fact that Ethereum is unfriendly to use as a result of expensive network or gas fees. Solana on the other hand got its first major critic in Fred Krueger who said many of the innovations being pushed out by the protocol are \u201cpure science fiction.\u201d\n\nWhile neither of the blockchain protocols is perfect, Yakovenko\u2019s post is an indication that both can truly exist together with more benefit to the broader crypto ecosystem."

        "content": "Share:\n\nLiquid Staking protocols ended the reign of Decentralized Exchanges (DEX), taking the spot of the second-biggest protocol after Lending.\n\nLiquid Staking still single-handedly eclipsed Lending as Lido DAO surpassed the TVL of AAVE and JustLend.\n\nAdditionally, when it comes to growth, Liquid Staking outperformed Lending, increasing by 334% and 176%, respectively.\n\nWith the year coming to an end, the DeFi market is also locking in the changes witnessed throughout 2023. One key change was the Ethereum Shapella hard fork that not only impacted the market but seemingly altered the face of the Decentralized (DeFi) market entirely.\n\nEthereum Shapella hard fork\n\nEthereum mainnet went through the Shanghai hard fork earlier this year in April, which enabled the option to withdraw the ETH staked by validators. This occasion was expected to be a hugely bearish event as the crypto market feared that the investors might choose to pull out their staked ETH.\n\nHowever, following the hard fork, the opposite happened as more money started pouring into staking protocols. With the option and safety of withdrawing their assets at any time, investors went in deep with staking, the result of which could be seen on the DeFi market.\n\nThe category of Liquid Staking protocols witnessed an increase starting in March, and by the end of June, it surpassed the Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) category. DEXes reigned as the second biggest protocol category since 2021, which came to an end.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, the total value locked (TVL) in Liquid Staking protocols increased by 334%, which is nearly twice the 176% growth witnessed by DEXes in the same period. Today, the former holds over $32 billion in TVL, while the latter contributes $21 billion to the DeFi market.\n\nDeFi market TVL distribution\n\nThe surge in Liquid Staking was such that Lido DAO, the biggest protocol in this category, outshined other top DeFi applications (Dapp), including AAVE, which belongs to the Lending category, the biggest by TVL. Today, Lido has over $22.3 billion worth of TVL, which is twice AAVE\u2019s $10.9 billion.\n\nTop DeFi protocols by TVL\n\nCome 2024, the demand for DeFi is expected to increase, and naturally, investors will choose to put their money in the safest form of returns, which could be being a validator on Ethereum. This will further boost the steady rise of TVL of Liquid Staking protocol, making it likely unsurpassable by any other Dapp category."

Apr '22 price action was part of preceding bear trend pic.twitter.com/yFvPj2ul3n \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 28, 2023\n\nTypically, the pattern develops during long-term uptrends or downtrends. Most technical experts regard it as a \"continuation pattern,\" implying that the overall market trend will most likely restart.\n\nInstead, Brandt highlights a wedge pattern on the Ethereum price chart, which is defined by converging trend lines connecting the corresponding highs and lows of a price series.\n\nA wedge, on the other hand, frequently predicts a price reversal. According to Brandt, the correct starting point for this intriguing pattern was the August 2022 high, and not the April 2022 high. Brandt adds that the April 2022 price action was rather part of the preceding bear trend.\n\nEthereum jumped to a high of $2,448 in today's trading, its highest level since May 2022. At the time of writing, ETH had slightly retreated from this high, albeit still up in the last 24 hours. ETH was up by 1.47% in the last 24 hours to $2,364, per CoinMarketCap data.\n\nIf the bulls keep pushing, Ethereum might reach $3,000. A breach below $2,200, on the other hand, may cause the price of ETH to fall to lower levels. As a result, the bulls must continue to defend this level, as a dip below it may trigger a further downturn to $1,900 and perhaps $1,750."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a sudden surge, breaking through the $2,400 mark and achieving a new high for the year. The cryptocurrency market, which has been notably volatile in recent weeks, witnessed ETH leading a robust rally, pushing major implied volatilities (IVs) to yearly highs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, what is intriguing is that institutional fear of missing out (FOMO) has yet to kick in, as noted by prominent market observers. Greeks.live, a cryptocurrency analytics platform, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share insights on Ethereum's recent performance. According to their tweet, the surge in ETH has not only propelled it to breach the $2,400 barrier but has also resulted in all major term IVs soaring to yearly highs.\n\nThe long-dormant #ETH led a new rally, breaking above $2,400 to a new high for the year, driving all major term IVs back to yearly highs, and DVOL back to 70%, also a new high since April.\n\n\n\nLooking at options data, Skew remains at recent levels and has not followed the rally,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/jhTjj5n23s \u2014 Greeks.live (@GreeksLive) December 28, 2023\n\nAdditionally, the daily volume (DVOL) spiked to 70%, reaching a level not seen since April. Analyzing options data, the tweet pointed out that the skew, a measure of the perceived distribution of potential price outcomes, has not followed the rally. This suggests that institutional traders are yet to fully embrace the FOMO associated with ETH's bullish run .\n\nMarket dynamics\n\nThe tweet also touched upon market dynamics, emphasizing the tight year-end liquidity conditions. It suggested that such conditions make the market susceptible to sudden spikes and falls. However, it noted a favorable breakeven ratio on options purchases, indicating a potential opportunity for strategic investors.\n\nAs of the latest available data, Ethereum is currently priced at $2,380, reflecting a notable 6.49% increase in the last 24 hours. Over the past 30 days, ETH has experienced an impressive surge of 18.88%. The trading volume of Ethereum has also witnessed a substantial uptick, rising by 84.35% in the last 24 hours and currently standing at $17.9 billion.\n\nDespite the impressive gains, the subdued response from institutional traders has left the market speculating about the potential catalysts that could trigger their entry into the FOMO-driven rally. Whether this is a brief pause before a larger institutional influx or a sign of cautious optimism remains to be seen. The cryptocurrency market, known for its unpredictability, continues to be a source of both excitement and speculation as the year draws to a close."

        "content": "Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin proposed three methods to address a possible \u201csystemic complexity\u201d stemming from the network\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus design.\n\nIn a Dec. 27 post on Ethereum\u2019s research forum, Buterin outlined his ideas for solving a budding pain point caused by increasing network validators and cryptographic signatures required for each blockchain slot.\n\nA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 27, 2023\n\nThe first way works through incentivizing mergers between validators teams by raising the minimum Ether (ETH) needed to run an Ethereum validator. This method revolves around the network\u2019s decentralized staking pools.\n\nSecondly, Buterin suggested dividing staking layers into two. One layer would feature stricter parameters, while the other would offer more flexible conditions. Both layers would be independent and operate under slightly separate blockchain rules aligned with Ethereum\u2019s ethos.\n\nButerin\u2019s third way proposed a mechanism to randomize a set of validators from a pool of network participants. A different basket of these teams would sign each slot, thus maintaining the 8192 signatures currently needed. This is the most complex alternative, according to Ethereum\u2019s co-founder.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum long-term holders hit record numbers, surpassing Bitcoin\n\nEthereum validators have more than doubled since The Merge in September 2022, going from around 430,000 to over 895,000. This increase also means an uptick in signatures needed to perform network operations and maintain Ethereum.\n\nUpcoming upgrades like Dencun may also elevate the required signatures, adding extra load, which Buterin hopes to avoid. Buterin previously shared his thoughts on improving decentralization by revamping staking on Ethereum and raised concerns about restaking services. The developer additionally warned against DAOs operating staking pool nodes.\n\nEthereum validator count | Source: beaconcha.in\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

The key factors driving the positive outlook are pointing to Ethereum\u2019s developer ecosystem, its role in the broader blockchain ecosystem, and the launch of numerous Layer-2 solutions (L2s).\n\nWill Layer-2 Activity Drive ETH To New Highs?\n\nBorovik.eth remained deviant and optimistic about ETH, even with Solana (OSL) and other layer-1 coins like Cardano (ADA) soaring in 2023. In the analyst\u2019s view, Ethereum\u2019s scaling challenges are manageable, believing that developers will find ways of \u201cresolving this concern permanently over the long term.\u201d\n\nBased on this optimism, the Rollbit partner believes that ETH will likely recover strongly in the coming sessions considering the level of development, especially of layer-2 scaling options meant for the pioneer smart contract platform. According to Borovik.eth, the development of layer-2 off-chain options backed by massive companies, for instance, Coinbase, a crypto exchange, and venture capitalists (VCs), positions Ethereum (ETH) favorably for a bull run.\n\nAs of December 26, ETH remains in an uptrend but is cooling off after solid gains in Q4 2023. At spot rates, ETH is underperforming most layer-1 platforms like Injective Protocol (INJ) and Solana (SOL), whose prices rallied, reaching new 2023 highs. ETH prices are still trending below $2,400, a critical resistance level. If bulls overcome this line, ETH may fly towards $3,500 or better in the months ahead.\n\nThe spike in SOL\u2019s valuation, especially in H2 2023, has led to a comparison with ETH. Even so, most traders are optimistic. Arthur Hayes recently stated that users should begin rotating funds from SOL to ETH, an endorsement of the second most valuable coin by market cap.\n\nEthereum Layer-2s Manage Over $18.8 Billion\n\nWhile Ethereum faces challenges around on-chain scaling, developers have been working hard to resolve this issue. The release of layer-2 off-chain options using rollups has been key in this drive. Most of these solutions, including Arbitrum and Optimism, have been critical in alleviating pressure from the mainnet, thus reducing gas fees. According to L2Beat, layer-2 protocols manage over $18 billion as total value locked (TVL). There are also 34 active projects, with 23 more being developed.\n\nAmong the big companies hitching the layer-2 ride is Coinbase, where through Base, users can transact cheaply while relying on the Ethereum mainnet for security. According to Borovik.eth, over 60% of Base\u2019s revenue is from rollup fees charged, highlighting the importance of their scaling solution and the role Ethereum plays in all this.\n\nRelated Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Moves $45 Million In SHIB, Bullish?\n\nThe upcoming Dencun Upgrade set for integration next year will further slash layer-2 fees.

        "content": "A new token in its ICO presale stage aims to enter the crypto market with a noteworthy ambition: Becoming Ethereum\u2019s premier store-of-value (SOV) asset.\n\nBranded \u201cMollars\u201d, this new project is being hailed a prospect for a pivotal role in the network, especially as Ether becomes more deflationary. And because Bitcoin, the top SOV asset, has seen fees soar recently.\n\nAccording to its whitepaper, Mollars will be an ownerless currency, with a max supply of 10,000,000 tokens minted. This means that right out of the gate, the project will enter the market as one of the most limited currencies in the landscape.\n\nThe token is currently on presale, priced at $0.30. However, as the ICO sale completes and the token is listed on its first crypto exchange, $MOLLARS will debut to the public at a price of $0.62. The public exchange pricing means that investors joining the presale during this \u2018private exchange\u2019 ICO period could see a 100% ROI days after it closes.\n\nIn the long run, as the \u2018new bitcoin\u2019 for the Ethereum blockchain world grows in popularity, the overall value of the token could be much higher. As it asserts its role as Ethereum\u2019s Store of Value asset, the end price has no ceiling and there\u2019s a potential to create new crypto millionaires.\n\nWhat Are Store-of-Value Coins?\n\nThe reason traders love such coins as $MOLLARS and $BTC is because store-of-value cryptocurrencies are digital assets specifically designed to retain purchasing power over time.\n\nTypically, the investment world always had precious metals such as Gold [AU] and Silver as storages of value, particularly in economic-uncertain times. In crypto, assets like Bitcoin have already proven their worth as SOVs during the pandemic, which opened the way for wider adoption of these types of currencies.\n\nUltimately, currencies like Bitcoin are considered safer investment vehicles due to their limited supply and decentralized nature. Their primary function is to preserve wealth, offering a hedge against inflation and economic instability. Unlike traditional fiat currencies prone to devaluation, store-of-value cryptocurrencies utilize blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, immutability, and scarcity. Investors often view them as a long-term store of wealth, relying on their stability and potential for future appreciation in value.\n\nHow Can $MOLLARS Serve as SOV in Ethereum Blockchain\n\nAnticipated for its limited supply of 10 million tokens and seamless ERC-20 compatibility, Mollars is projected to emerge as a pioneering solution catering to the need for stability, cost-efficiency, and enhanced functionality in managing digital assets.\n\nEnthusiasts foresee a strategic shift among Bitcoin holders toward Mollars tokens as a preferred vehicle for storing value, leveraging Ethereum\u2019s anticipated advancements in speed, reduced transaction costs, and expanded capabilities. This envisioned transition to Mollars would circumvent challenges such as potential congestion and high fees prevalent on the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring swifter transactions and capitalizing on Ethereum\u2019s forthcoming smart contract functionalities.\n\nThe envisioned adoption of Mollars as a future store of value extends beyond pragmatic cost-saving measures; it signifies an opportunity for diversified asset allocation across multiple blockchains. Embracing its interoperability within Ethereum\u2019s evolving ecosystem, Mollars is projected to grant users access to upcoming decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) innovations while safeguarding their assets within a dependable and stable token.\n\nMollars Could Be Worth 100 Times More In the Future\n\nThe currency\u2019s limited supply and potential as an SOV puts Mollars as a contender for the cryptocurrency market\u2019s next \u2018x100Gem\u2019.\n\nThe current presale offering at $0.30, will reach $0.62 on listing day, hints at an immediate potential for a 100% return on investment (ROI). However, the currency\u2019s underlying ambition as an SOV suggests a much larger prospective value.\n\nExperts and early investors are eyeing Mollars as a potential growth catalyst, projecting a scenario where its value could skyrocket, potentially worth 100 times more than its current price. Such substantial growth projections stem from the combination of Ethereum\u2019s anticipated advancements, Bitcoin holders\u2019 strategic transition, and Mollars\u2019 role as a stable, cross-chain asset.\n\nThe concept of a store-of-value token like Mollars represents a paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency market, mirroring the broader global trend of seeking stable and secure assets amidst economic uncertainties. As Mollars inches closer to its initial coin offering (ICO) and subsequent launch, the market anticipation for its potential valuation amplifies, setting the stage for a promising future as an integral part of Ethereum\u2019s digital asset ecosystem.\n\nCurrently just under 31,000 tokens have been sold.

Prior to Arkham Intelligence\u2019s speculation, Trump confirmed that he owned a crypto wallet that held up to $5 million worth of Ethereum earned from NFT licensing fees.\n\nAccording to a filing with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in January, Trump could have made up to $1 million from CIC Digital, the company behind the sale of his NFTs.\n\nTrump and Biden Criticized for Not Understanding Crypto\n\n\n\nInitially released in December 2022, Trump\u2019s trading cards marked his involvement in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. In the meantime, Trump and President Joe Biden were criticized for not understanding crypto by Representative Dean Phillips.\n\nDuring the Crypto Presidential Forum, Democratic nominee Phillips acknowledged his own gaps in knowledge about financial technology and digital assets, but pointed out the scarcity of expertise in Congress regarding these topics, specifically targeting Trump and Biden.\n\n\u201cThe two leading candidates right now, on both the left and the right, for the U.S. presidency are absolutely not in positions to understand it, prepare us for it, anticipate it, and lead us into the next century,\u201d said Phillips. \u201cJoe Biden and Donald Trump, at their age and stage of life, are simply not the right people to lead us forward.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMugShot\u201d Edition Trading Cards\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Trump introduced his latest \u201cMugShot\u201d edition NFT collection, referring to his previous arrest.

        "content": "Crypto Analyst Lark Davis Predicts Ethereum Price to Surge to $15,000 in 2024 \u2014 Here\u2019s the Latest\n\nCryptocurrency analyst Lark Davis has predicted that Ethereum will reach a price of $15,000 per coin in the upcoming bull cycle of 2024-2025.\n\nDespite the asset\u2019s relatively subdued performance this year, Davis foresees a significant upswing that could potentially yield substantial gains for investors.\n\nIn a video published on X on December 25, Davis explained that the anticipated surge would not be triggered through buying, selling, or staking but rather through Ethereum layer-2 assets.\n\nEthereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think pic.twitter.com/00YCLPyGCl \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 25, 2023\n\nThe YouTuber also delved into the current and upcoming layer-2 listings, including zkSync, Starknet, Linea, Scroll, Blast, Manta, and Celestia. He highlighted the potential for short-term profits associated with these new listings.\n\nWhile acknowledging the historical pump-and-dump patterns observed in newly launched tokens, Davis pointed out instances where tokens gained significant traction after being listed on major exchanges.\n\nDespite presenting potential opportunities, Davis offered a cautious outlook for Ethereum in 2024. Drawing comparisons with historical gains, he predicted substantial growth if Ethereum replicates or slightly surpasses its previous cycle\u2019s highs, which reached around $4,800 in November 2021.\n\nFollowing its all-time high, ETH experienced a notable 81% decline during the bear cycle, reaching its lowest point at $880 on June 18, 2022.\n\nSubsequently, Ethereum embarked on a recovery trajectory, predominantly exhibiting an upward trend throughout 2023. This culminated in a noteworthy high of $2,400 on December 9 and a press time price of $2,367.\n\nHowever, Davis cautioned that individuals entering the market at the current Ethereum price may only experience significant gains if they make substantial investments.\n\nSOL Poised to Be the Better Asset\n\n\n\nThe price of SOL, the native cryptocurrency of the smart-contract-enabled layer-1 Solana blockchain protocol, has surged significantly, surpassing the $118 mark and reaching its highest value in eighteen months. As of December 27, the asset\u2019s price stood at $108.59.\n\nThis notable uptick coincided with a surge in gas fees within the Ethereum ecosystem, where transaction costs briefly spiked above $10. Some users even reported fees as high as $150 for transactions worth only $50 on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAlthough Ethereum gas fees have since decreased by 50% from the week\u2019s peak, users have actively explored alternative blockchain platforms with lower transaction costs, leading to increased activity on Solana.\n\nMessari\u2019s December 14 report further highlights a staggering 400% increase in active addresses on Solana in the last three months, compared to Ethereum\u2019s 3%.\n\nIn Q4 alone, active addresses on Solana have increased by nearly 400% compared to a mere 3% increase on Ethereum. Dive into the report \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/70XuVFgax0 \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) December 18, 2023\n\nSolana\u2019s appeal is underscored by its consistently low fees, averaging less than $0.01, according to CoinCodex\u2019s recent report.\n\nFurthermore, the platform has recorded a positive trend in fund flows. Solana-based investment funds attracted $10.6 million in the week ending December 16, surpassing inflows into major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nIn December alone, Solana funds saw inflows of $14.1 million, marking the highest in the cryptocurrency sector. Currently, SOL\u2019s trajectories outpace those of ETH, suggesting its potential as a superior asset for a significant surge in the upcoming bull run next year.\n\nHowever, this swift ascent prompts a crucial question within the crypto community: Is the remarkable rise in Solana\u2019s value a fleeting occurrence, or does it mark the commencement of a new era in its market dominance?\n\nThe answer is entwined in a complex interplay of market trends, investor sentiment, and the evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape."

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has published a new proposal that seeks to reduce the required number of signatures from validators to streamline the Ethereum network\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 27, 2023\n\nAccording to Buterin, the proposal aims to make Ethereum\u2019s consensus implementation \u201cconsiderably simpler and lighter\u201d by reducing the signature requirement per slot from roughly 28,000 to just 8,192 signatures.\n\nTo date, Ethereum has roughly 895,000 validators, with each validator being required to stake 32 ether (ETH) and become activated within the network. Ethereum does this to maintain decentralization and open access for more participants to help with staking, but this also results in more load on the network because of processing requirements.\n\n\u201cThe signature aggregation system feels reasonable at first glance, but in reality it creates systemic complexity that bleeds out all over the place,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nWith Buterin\u2019s proposal, the signature load for future upgrades would be predictable and limited, simplifying protocol and infrastructure development efforts. However, this also means that Ethereum\u2019s network load could still be increased through hard forks.\n\nButerin points out that such a system opens up compromises, limiting quantum security, complicated upgrades, and an apparent reliance on zero-knowledge proofs to manage scale.\n\nButerin believes that his proposal will simplify the proof-of-stake design and allow for a \u201clarge amount of technical simplification.\u201d\n\n\u201c[\u2026] instead of relying on cryptographers to create magic bullets (or magic bulletproofs) to make an ever-increasing number of signatures per slot possible, I propose that we make a philosophical pivot: move away from having such an expectation in the first place,\u201d the Ethereum co-founder stated.\n\nThe proposal provides three approaches to enable the reduction of required signatures: a shift to prioritizing reliance on decentralized staking pools, a two-tier system that provides options for \u201cheavy\u201d and \u201clight\u201d staking, and rotating validator subsets through committees.\n\nThe first approach suggests that Ethereum could discard direct access to the consensus layer in favor of using decentralized staking pools exclusively, raising deposit minimums but capping pool-related penalties to avoid over-reliance on operators.\n\nIn the second method, a two-tiered approach creates heavy-stake validators specifically assigned to finalize blocks. This is then supplemented by a lighter security layer that has no minimum thresholds to participate.\n\nThe third approach proposes a set construction that is proportional to a validator\u2019s stake weight and rotates participants dynamically.\n\nButerin notes that the third approach effectively decouples weight for incentive purposes (validator rewards) from stake weight for consensus purposes. This means that each validator\u2019s reward within the committee (based on an agreed-upon rotation) should be the same, keeping average rewards proportional to the balance.\n\n\u201cThe future load of the Ethereum protocol becomes no longer an unknown: it can be raised in the future through hard forks, but only when developers are confident that technology has improved enough to be able to handle a larger number of signatures-per-slot with the same level of ease,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nThe main tradeoff is between a significant reduction in validator participation per slot and increased technical feasibility and flexibility. The proposal aims to balance the network\u2019s decentralization and scalability, but its critics argue that the changes it carries may diverge from Ethereum\u2019s core philosophy.\n\nWhile the purpose of improving Ethereum\u2019s scalability with a leaner signature scheme may appear to be well-meaning, commentators on Vitalik\u2019s proposal have raised concerns about possible security flaws due to the reduced complexity, which may open new attack vectors if any of the three approaches are implemented. To this end, Buterin responded that streamlining the protocol design offers \u201csecurity through simplicity\u201d while enhancing the network\u2019s resilience against state-level attacks."

Expert predictions hint at a stunning 74% price surge for THORChain (RUNE) in 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH) saw a slight uptick after Vitalik Buterin moved 500 ETH to Coinbase. Meanwhile, an emerging crypto coin has attracted the attention of investors after raising $950,000 in its presale. On the other hand, THORChain (RUNE) has forged a new partnership to enable BTC and ETH lending.\n\nRead on as we dive deep into the latest developments around ETH and RUNE and explore why the new meme coin is the best crypto to invest in!\n\nEthereum Co-founder Moves 500 ETH to Coinbase\n\nOn December 19, 2023, the cryptocurrency community was abuzz with discussions surrounding a significant event involving Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum.\n\nEtherscan data revealed a massive transfer of 500 ETH by Buterin to Coinbase, triggering speculations about a potential sale of ETH holdings. The nature of such transfers often leaves room for uncertainty \u2013 when funds are moved to an unknown address, it\u2019s unclear if a sale occurred.\n\nHowever, the transfer to a prominent exchange like Coinbase increases the likelihood of a sale, though it remains inconclusive.

It is anticipated that ETH will surpass the $3,900 mark, reaching $3,933.35 in 2024. This optimistic outlook is attributed to the anticipation of an upcoming bull run and the potential approval of an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nConversely, bearish forecasts caution that ETH\u2019s price might remain below $3,277.56 in 2024 if the market sentiment turns bearish.\n\nRebel Satoshi Can Surpass Top Altcoins With 150% Profit Potential\n\nTop altcoins have dominated the market for quite some time now. However, a new contender is here to challenge the dominance of top crypto coins with a rebellious approach, and it\u2019s called Rebel Satoshi (RBLZ).\n\nWhile $RBLZ, the native token of Rebel Satoshi, does offer remarkable growth prospects, it goes beyond financial gains, calls for a rebellion against the status quo, and aims to promote decentralization. Furthermore, Rebel Satoshi focuses on building a strong community of rebels to achieve its audacious goals, including $100 million in market capitalization.\n\nRebel Satoshi has garnered immense appraisal for its ongoing presale after raising a staggering $950,000 in funding by selling over 79% of its presale supply. This unprecedented presale performance has put $RBLZ among altcoins to watch for exponential growth in 2024.\n\nAfter selling its Early Bird Round in just three weeks at $0.010 per $RBLZ, Rebel Satoshi soared by 100% to reach $0.02 per $RBLZ in the ongoing Citizens Round 3. It implies that investors can buy $RBLZ tokens at $0.02 using Bitcoin and 50 other cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, market analysts predict $RBLZ will reach $0.025 during its official listing, bringing a stunning 150% ROI for early investors!\n\nTHORChain Joins Hands With Shapeshift to Enable BTC and ETH Lending\n\nOn December 18, 2023, Shapeshift, a prominent crypto-swapping platform, made a groundbreaking announcement on X regarding THORChain. Shapeshift revealed that it has expanded its services to include THORChain lending against both Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nThe platform outlined a unique lending process wherein, upon opening a new loan, the collateral provided undergoes a swap to RUNE. The innovative approach ensures that the difference between the loan value and the collateral value is burned, eliminating the need for liquidations or interest.\n\nThe price of THORChain\u2019s native token, RUNE, experienced a notable increase following the announcement by Shapeshift. The market positively responded to the news, witnessing a rise of 9.7% in RUNE\u2019s price from $5.1406 on December 18 to $5.6434 on December 27.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, experts predict a promising future for THORChain. The RUNE price is anticipated to surge by 74%, reaching $9.78 in 2024. This optimistic outlook is attributed to THORChain\u2019s increasing adoption and the widespread anticipation of an upcoming bull run.\n\nHowever, cautious forecasts suggest that the RUNE price may stay below $8.40 in 2024 if the market sentiments turn bearish.For the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram"

        "content": "The meme crypto coin Bonk (BONK) recently made headlines with its impressive performance, nearly doubling in value within 24 hours. Amidst this remarkable growth, holders of Ethereum (ETC) and Avalanche (AVAX) have shown a keen interest in acquiring tokens of the emerging presale gem, Pullix (PLX).\n\nBonk's (BONK) Spectacular Market Surge\n\nBonk (BONK), initially designed as a meme coin within the Solana ecosystem, has achieved an explosive growth of nearly 100% in just 24 hours, its volume reaching $1.5 billion. This unexpected upsurge can be attributed to several strategic factors.\n\nFirstly, the listing of Bonk on prominent cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase played a crucial role, substantially increasing its visibility and investor appeal. Such listings often confer a sense of legitimacy and attract significant trading activity. Additionally, Bonk's adoption within the Solana ecosystem, where it's used for transactions involving non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has further bolstered its market position.\n\nDespite a decline in its trading volume, Bonk's performance has notably outshined other major meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), indicating a strong market presence and growing investor interest.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) Impressive Yearly Growth\n\nEthereum (ETH), a leading player in the cryptocurrency market, has exhibited a remarkable performance over the past year, with its value soaring by 82.51%. Currently priced at $2,213.49, Ethereum has cemented its position as a dominant force in the crypto world.\n\nThis significant increase can be attributed to several key developments in the Ethereum ecosystem. Most notably, the much-anticipated upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, aimed at improving scalability and energy efficiency, has been a major factor driving investor confidence and market growth. Additionally, the widespread adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), both predominantly built on the Ethereum blockchain, has further fueled Ethereum's market ascension. Ethereum's robust performance underscores its vital role in the broader crypto landscape and its potential for continued growth and innovation.\n\nAvalanche's (AVAX) Steady Week-long Climb\n\nAvalanche (AVAX), a burgeoning star in the cryptocurrency market, has witnessed a significant increase of 17.77% over the past week, with its current value reaching $42.88. This uptick reflects Avalanche's growing prominence and resilience in the highly volatile crypto market.\n\nThe platform, Avalanche, known for its high throughput and scalability, has been steadily gaining traction among developers and investors alike. In particular, for Avalanche's efficient processing of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. This recent surge in price could be linked to the increasing adoption of Avalanche's technology and the expansion of its ecosystem, including collaborations and integrations within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\n\nAvalanche's performance over the last seven days not only highlights its potential as a strong competitor in the blockchain space. It also underscores the market's appetite for innovative and efficient blockchain solutions, which Avalanche demonstrates.\n\nPullix: The Crypto Trading Landscape's Newest Invention\n\nPullix, an innovative trading exchange, is poised to reshape the cryptocurrency trading world by bridging the gap between decentralized and centralized exchanges. With its upcoming launch, Pullix aims to tackle one of the most persistent issues in the DeFi space - liquidity. By providing a unified platform, Pullix makes it simpler for users to access liquidity and engage in global asset trading more seamlessly.\n\nThis groundbreaking approach not only addresses liquidity challenges but also ensures enhanced security, reflecting the adage \u201cNot your keys, not your coins.\u201d Pullix stands out by allowing users to maintain custody of their assets, combining the security features of centralized exchanges with the autonomy of decentralized platforms.\n\nIn terms of liquidity provision, Pullix introduces a unique incentive model. By encouraging users to contribute liquidity, the platform ensures better rates and enhanced market competitiveness. Such features are expected to drive user growth and increase the demand for PLX tokens.\n\nA notable feature of Pullix is its deep liquidity, achieved through partnerships with tier-1 banks and community staking of cryptocurrencies like ETH and Bitcoin. The platform also offers up to 1000:1 leverage for margin trading across various asset classes.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities"

        "content": "For Ethereum to thrive, there must be a willingness among investors to engage with the crypto markets and their associated ecosystems, a trend that seems poised to gain momentum in 2024.\n\nEthereum experienced a downturn in the early hours of Tuesday, further underscoring the prevailing volatility in this market.\n\nIn the grander scheme of things, Ethereum appears poised to gain more momentum.\n\nHowever, the current situation can be attributed to the rapid ascent it recently enjoyed, combined with the fact that we are navigating the period between Christmas and New Year's Day, a time when market liquidity tends to dwindle.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nMajor Support Level Below\n\nA crucial level to watch is the $2100 mark, which should serve as a significant support zone. This level has not only provided support in the past but has also demonstrated resistance to buying pressure. Market participants are likely to bear in mind this historical significance, potentially presenting an attractive opportunity for value-oriented investors. On the upside, the $2500 level looms large, and a successful breach of this level could pave the way for a move toward the $3000 mark. Over the longer term, there is potential for Ethereum to reach the $3500 level. However, the immediate future is likely to be marked by choppy, back-and-forth price movements.\n\nIn terms of strategy, a prudent approach would involve buying the dips, but doing so incrementally rather than diving headfirst into the market. The next few sessions could be characterized by unusual price movements, making it essential to exercise caution. Nevertheless, Ethereum appears to have a bullish outlook in the long run, especially as interest rates in the United States continue to decline. This decline in interest rates has historically been favorable for the broader cryptocurrency market. As traders become more willing to embrace risk, Ethereum stands to benefit. Ethereum holds a unique position within the market as the foundation for numerous tokens and ecosystems built upon its platform. For Ethereum to thrive, there must be a willingness among investors to engage with the crypto markets and their associated ecosystems, a trend that seems poised to gain momentum in 2024.\n\nAs Ethereum charts its course into 2024, investors and traders should remain vigilant, closely monitoring key support and resistance levels underneath, and adopting a measured approach to capitalize on potential opportunities in this market, as the buyers will be under current levels to continue to lift ETH to higher levels, as the \u201ccheap money\u201d coming from the Federal Reserve will continue to be a major influence on not only the Ethereum market but also other cryptocurrencies.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD? Here\u2019s a list of some of the best crypto brokers to check out."

Discover SCENE\n\nDonald Trump is dumping his bags.\n\nWeeks after attempting\u2014with little success\u2014to breathe life into his NFT trading card business for a third time, the former president appears to be divesting his considerable crypto holdings.\n\nAccording to an analysis by blockchain intelligence firm Arkham, Trump began sending ETH he had accumulated as NFT royalties to Coinbase earlier this month. In the last three weeks, he\u2019s sold off 1,075 ETH, for a total haul of $2.4 million.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nArkham says that still leaves Trump with $2.2 million in various cryptocurrencies\u2014$1.4 million worth of ETH, $649,000 worth of WETH, $167,000 worth of MAGA coin, $340 worth of Pepecoin, and $145 worth of JESUS, among other holdings.\n\nLooks like Donald Trump is selling his ETH. 3 weeks ago he started sending ETH to Coinbase after months of accumulating Trump NFT royalties. His peak balance was $4 million.

He recently claimed at a campaign rally, though, that he owes over $100 million in legal fees, given his current entanglement as a defendant in four separate, ongoing criminal prosecutions.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

Additionally, BTC dominance continues to decline, which is favourable for altcoins. BTC needs to clear the key resistance at $44,500 for further upward movement, said CoinDCX Research Team.Other popular altcoins, such as BNB, Cardano, and Chainlink gained 9-13%.

The number of transactions worth at least a million jumped by 52% from the previous day.\n\nThe market possibly reacted to co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s plans to simplify the network\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.\n\nVitalik\u2019s proposals ignite confidence\n\nIn a blog post dated the 27th of December, the crypto tzar stressed the need to weed out a systemic complexity arising due to the mechanism\u2019s design of supporting n number of validators.\n\nThe first solution proposed by him was to do away with solo staking and fix decentralized stake pools as the only way for users to participate in the network.\n\nHowever, the minimum staking requirement would be raised to 4096 ETH and the number of validators capped at 4096.\n\nThe second was a two-tiered approach. In this case, a heavy layer with 4096 ETH requirement and a light layer with small-scale stakers for providing an extra layer of security.\n\nLast was the rotating participation method wherein for each slot a set number of validators, around 4096, would be chosen. While this strategy had advantages over the other two, it carried the danger of increased complexity.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the community will respond to these proposals. However, ideas to improve the network\u2019s performance from the horse\u2019s mouth generated an optimistic view of ETH.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nETH gets volatile\n\nThe rally caused a dramatic spike in ETH\u2019s Implied Volatility (IV), according to options data tracking website\n\nFor the uninitiated, Implied Volatility is the market\u2019s forecast of a likely movement in an asset\u2019s price.

        "content": "The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism at the core of Ethereum, according to co-founder Vitalik Buterin, may face systemic complexity. To address this, he has three solutions.\n\n\u201cA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter,\u201d he wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe primary problem is that to keep the network functioning properly, validators that maintain it must create a large number of digital signatures using encryption.\n\nThe network already has a lot of work to handle from this, but as additional validators join, the number of signatures will rise, adding to the system\u2019s workload. Subsequent updates are expected to raise the required signatures even more dramatically.\n\nOn December 27, Buterin wrote a post to the Ethereum Research forum outlining three approaches to avoid this. The shared goal is to reduce the number of signatures needed for each Ethereum blockchain space to 8,192.\n\nThe first solution is centered on decentralized staking pools. This would need raising the minimum amount of ether needed to run a validator to force people running validators to collaborate and pool their resources.\n\nVitalik\u2019s second solution is to have two layers of stakeholders, one with stricter criteria and the other with more lax ones would be the second strategy. During the block finalization process, the two levels would be used in distinct ways.\n\nThe third option would be to have a rotating group of participants, in which case a different group of validators is chosen at random for each slot. Although Buterin pointed out that it would increase complexity, this would divide out the workload and lower the overall number of signatures."

        "content": "Ethereum price has all the indicators showing the bulls are in control fueled by the high demand from institutional investors and the rise of EVM-compatible blockchains.\n\nWith Bitcoin price struggling to rally beyond $44.5k, crypto cash flow has accelerated to Ether following a successful macro breakout and retest.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the undisputed king of smart contracts securing billions of dollars, is gradually awakening from a two-year crypto bear market. With investors\u2019 confidence significantly higher during the 2023 fourth quarter compared to the same time last year, the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the Ethereum-based DeFi protocols is on the cusp of going parabolic.\n\nMoreover, the ongoing altcoin rise relies on the Ethereum coins for liquidity to a greater extent. Additionally, the number of staked Ether has continued to grow to about 28.6 million from over 895k validators since the Sharpella upgrade earlier this year.\n\nThe Ethereum network is well bolstered by the growing layer two (L2) solutions like Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), and Polygon (MATIC), among others. As a result, the Ethereum ecosystem can comfortably handle the increasing demand without experiencing network congestion. Additionally, the Ethereum network has been operating under the base fee since the EIP-1559, which also introduced the auto-burning mechanism, whereby more than 3.8 million ETH have been obliterated.\n\nNonetheless, the Ethereum network has been facing notable competition from upcoming layer one blockchains like Solana (SOL), BNB Smart Chain (BSC), and Cardano (ADA). However, the spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) application in the United States indicates the rising demand for the second-largest crypto asset.\n\nCloser Look at Ethereum Price Analysis\n\nAccording to a popular anonymous crypto analyst on the X platform dubbed Inmortal, Ethereum price is on the verge of printing consecutive major bull candles, alias god candle. Notably, the crypto analyst has set the first ETH price target at around $3,500 before the mother altcoin proceeds towards its all-time high (ATH).\n\nThe crypto analyst reminded traders who have been migrating to SOL and other coins due to their meteoric rise that Ethereum is not dead. Moreover, Ethereum is closely following Bitcoin price action, which is about 150 percent away from its all-time high.\n\nEthereum god candle will catch many people off guard. \"ETH is dead\"\n\n\"ETH is broken\" Do you think this market gives a s**t about that?\n\nHuman greed has no limits.$ETH \u2014 Inmortal (@inmortalcrypto) December 22, 2023\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, ETH/USD on the weekly time frame has seen the Relative Strength Index (RSI) rally towards the 70 level for the first time in two years. Bolstered by a daily golden cross between the 50 and 200 Moving Average (MA), the ETH price is undeniably on the cusp of a major uproar. Furthermore, the altcoin has successfully retested the breakout of an ascending triangle following the recent spike towards $2,400.\n\nMarket Outlook\n\nEthereum price has gained more than 10% since the end of the Christmas break to trade at $2,400.\n\nThe Ethereum market outlook has continued to broaden with the notable clear crypto regulatory environment worldwide. With a market cap of about $287 billion, Ether\u2019s price only needs to triple to reach that of Bitcoin around $838 billion.\n\n."

        "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, with Ethereum (ETH) standing out as a pioneer in the field of proof of stake.\n\nRecently, ETH has recorded an increase of 6.77%, a positive signal for investors and industry enthusiasts.\n\nThis development can largely be attributed to the proposal by Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, to simplify the proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism of the platform.\n\nThe problem of complexity in Ethereum\u2019s proof of stake\n\nThe heart of the matter lies in the intrinsic systemic complexity of Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism. Buterin has identified a critical node: the management of digital signatures. Validators, responsible for the network\u2019s operation, must produce a high number of digital signatures.\n\nThis process, already burdensome, becomes even more burdensome with the increase of validators, leading to system overload.\n\nFuture implementations could even further intensify the signing requirements. The challenge is therefore not only to maintain, but also to optimize efficiency in a constantly growing ecosystem.\n\nAddressing this issue is crucial to ensure the long-term scalability and sustainability of Ethereum.\n\nThe solution proposed by Buterin aims to simplify the process without sacrificing the security and integrity of the network.\n\nButerin\u2019s three proposals to simplify the process\n\nButerin outlined three possible solutions at the Ethereum research forum on December 27th. The common focus of the proposals is to reduce the number of signatures required per slot to 8,192 in the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nDecentralized staking pools: The first solution proposes the introduction of decentralized staking pools. This would involve increasing the minimum amount of ether required to run a validator, encouraging operators to collaborate and pool their resources. This approach could not only lighten the workload of individual validators but also promote an atmosphere of cooperation and mutualism within the Ethereum network. two levels of stakers: The second solution involves creating two levels of stakers: one with more demanding requirements and the other with lighter requirements. These two levels would be treated differently in the block finalization process. This structure could provide greater flexibility and accessibility for different types of participants in the network, balancing security and inclusivity. Rotating participants: Finally, the third proposal suggests the adoption of a system of rotating participants, where a random set of validators is selected for each slot. This system would distribute the workload and reduce the total number of signatures, but it would add complexity to the system. This method could improve fairness and decentralization, ensuring a more even distribution of responsibilities and rewards among participants.\n\nConclusion\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal represents a significant step towards a more efficient and effective implementation of the PoS mechanism in Ethereum.\n\nBy reducing the complexity and workload of validators, Ethereum could achieve greater scalability and security. It is clear that the future of Ethereum, with its transition to the proof of stake model, still holds many innovations and potential improvements.\n\nIn addition, this evolution highlights Ethereum\u2019s ongoing commitment to finding solutions that not only improve network performance, but also contribute to greater decentralization and democracy in the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nButerin\u2019s vision for a leaner and more robust system could prove crucial in the evolution of the cryptocurrency industry, marking an era of new possibilities and applications."
