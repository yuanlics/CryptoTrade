        "content": "zkSync, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, recorded more transactions than the Ethereum mainnet over a one-month period, processing 34.7 million transactions in the past 30 days.\n\nA total of 34.2 million transactions were recorded on Ethereum's mainnet during the same period, according to L2Beat data. Next in line was Arbitrum, which saw 31.4 million transactions over the past 30 days.\n\nThe recent rise in transaction volume on zkSync has been attributed to the spread of inscriptions \u2014 a feature originally created on Bitcoin \u2014 to EVM networks, including most Layer 2 chains.\n\nData from L2Beat highlights that zkSync experienced its biggest monthly transaction surge on Dec. 16. That's when sync inscription was rolled out on the network and constituted 4.6 million of the 5.3 million transactions that day alone, according to Dune data aggregated by Dragonfly analyst Hildobby.\n\nInscription-related transactions\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nzkSync operates as a Layer 2 network on the Ethereum mainnet. By bundling hundreds or thousands of transactions into a single cryptographic proof, it verifies transactions much faster and more cheaply than the mainnet.\n\nSince mid-December, inscription-related transactions have contributed to zkSync\u2019s overall activity, helping it surpass both Ethereum and its Layer 2s.\n\nInscriptions are data embeds found in transaction call data, which, like Ordinals on Bitcoin, can be used to create alternate tokens and NFTs. Such tokens include Ethscriptions on Ethereum, Doginals on Dogecoin and Solana Inscriptions on Solana."

        "content": "Ethereum has been upstaged by one of its layer 2s in 30-day transaction count.\n\nZkSync\u2019s transaction spike has resulted in lower fees.\n\nDevelopment is positive step for Ethereum's scalability.\n\nEthereum has been knocked off its perch, at least when it comes to the monthly number of transactions.\n\nZkSync, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, has managed to process more transactions than Ethereum in the last 30 days, according to data from L2Beat, a portal that tracks data for such buzzy blockchains.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a feat because it is the first time Ethereum has been surpassed by any of its layer 2s in 30-day transaction numbers.\n\nEthereum layer 2 blockchains like zkSync help scale the blockchain with increased speed while relying on the mainnet\u2019s security.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n30-day transaction count for Ethereum and its layer-2s. Source: L2Beat\n\nIt\u2019s also significant that the transaction spike has not resulted in higher fees on zkSync. Instead, fees have dipped 44% within the same period, data from blockchain analytics portal growthepie shows.\n\nIt currently costs about $0.13 to use the network to send tokens while it is $2 on the Ethereum mainnet. More complicated transactions like token swaps cost even higher, as much as $35 as of the time of reporting.\n\nThis fee decline supports the expectation that zkSync should become cheaper to use as it scales.\n\nZkSync\u2019s run to the top of the ladder has come amid a boom in inscriptions on Ethereum-based blockchains.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nInscriptions are data files for applications like NFTs and meme coins embedded on blockchains in a way that is supposed to be cheaper than using smart contracts.\n\nThey first emerged on Bitcoin but have now become a trend on Ethereum-based blockchains.\n\nTotal investor deposits in zkSync, as measured by \"total value locked\"\n\nTransaction-spamming associated with the inscriptions trend has become a stress test for blockchains like zkSync and Arbitrum with the latter going offline on December 15.\n\nThe milestone also comes after zkSync had a minor hiccup on Christmas. Block production was paused amid a temporary network outage for the blockchain.\n\nThe developers behind zkSync said the problem was due to a bug in the chain\u2019s server and promised a full post-mortem of the incident. Some security researchers say the issue may have involved the blockchain\u2019s Sequencer.\n\nZkSync uses a Sequencer to verify, organise, and bundle transactions to Ethereum for finality. Layer 2 Sequencers have been prone to faults in the past with Arbitrum, a zkSync suffering a similar fate in June.\n\nApart from Inscriptions, zkSync\u2019s transaction count also has a prominent airdrop footprint. Matter Labs has been mum about the possibility of an airdrop, but that has not stopped DeFi users from piling into the chain in hopes of a potential airdrop win.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "title": "Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Aim To Change PoS: Here Are His Three Proposals - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin has proposed three strategies to address the increasing complexity of the PoS consensus mechanism.\n\nOne strategy involves increasing the minimum amount of Ether required to operate as a validator.\n\nAnother strategy suggests implementing a two-tier staking system with one layer having more stringent requirements and another layer having more lenient requirements.\n\nA third approach involves randomly assigning validators to slots to distribute the workload more evenly.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has put forward three solutions aimed at addressing what he terms a potential systemic complexity in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nIn a recent post , Buterin suggested a design overhaul to limit the requirement to just 8,192 signatures per slot, a move that could significantly simplify and lighten the consensus implementation.\n\nButerin\u2019s Three Strategies\n\nThe proposal comes as a response to the challenge posed by the increasing number of validators on the Ethereum network, which, in turn, amplifies the volume of cryptographic signatures needed to maintain network functionality.\n\nA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 27, 2023\n\nThese signatures are fundamental to the network\u2019s operation, but their growing number could burden the system, especially with upcoming upgrades expected to further escalate these requirements.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal, recently shared on the Ethereum Research forum , centers around efficiently reducing the signature count to manage this burgeoning complexity.\n\nThe proposal includes :\n\nDecentralized Staking Pools: The first method proposed by Buterin involves increasing the minimum amount of Ether required to operate as a validator. This change would necessitate validators to collaborate and pool their resources, promoting the formation of decentralized staking pools. Dual-Layer Staking System: The second strategy suggests the implementation of a two-tier staking system. In this model, one layer would have more stringent requirements, while the other would be more lenient. These layers would play distinct roles in the block finalization process, offering a balanced approach to validator participation and responsibilities. Rotating Validator Participation: The third approach introduces a system where a randomly selected group of validators is assigned to each slot. This method aims to distribute the workload more evenly among validators, thereby reducing the overall number of necessary signatures. However, Buterin acknowledges that this solution could introduce additional complexity into the system.\n\nA New Era of Efficient and Scalable Consensus Mechanism\n\nEthereum\u2019s consensus mechanism, especially after its transition to Ethereum 2.0, is based on a Proof of Stake (PoS) model, a significant shift from the original Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism.\n\nIn PoS, the process of validating transactions and creating new blocks is handled by validators, who are chosen on the amount of cryptocurrency (Ether, in Ethereum\u2019s case) they hold and are willing to \u201cstake\u201d as collateral. This staking process is less energy-intensive compared to the computational work required in PoW.\n\nThe issue that the Ethereum founder wants to raise here is that validators participating in the Proof-of-Stake network are required to sign and approve transactions many times. As the network has more and more validators, the number of signatures will also increase exponentially,\u2026 \u2014 jesica guardad (@jkimyw) December 28, 2023\n\nValidators are selected to propose and vote on new blocks, with their influence proportional to the size of their stake. This method aims to enhance network security and scalability, as well as reduce energy consumption.\n\nThe consensus is achieved when validators agree on the state of the blockchain, ensuring that all transactions are accurate and no double-spending occurs. This mechanism plays a crucial role in Ethereum\u2019s ability to execute smart contracts and maintain a decentralized, trustless system."

        "title": "3 Charts For Investors to Watch Thursday: GC Education, Iovance, Ethereum - Investopedia",
        "content": "Key Takeaways The Grand Canyon Education share price has been trending higher, but on lower-than-average trading volumes.\n\nIovance shares gapped sharply lower, although they closed well above their session lows.\n\nEthereum's price has broken above a pennant, a chart pattern that typically indicates a continuation of the current trend.\n\nHere's our daily look at three charts connected to recent news-driven price moves, with key technical levels to monitor.\n\nGrand Canyon Education, Inc.\n\nSource: TradingView.com.\n\nShares in Grand Canyon Education (LOPE) may come under the microscope Thursday after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said it has filed a lawsuit against the education services provider for deceptive advertising, illegal telemarketing and misrepresenting the school as a nonprofit organization. A key element of the FTC\u2019s filing alleges that the school has deceived prospective doctoral students about the cost and course requirements of its doctoral programs. The lawsuit comes just two months after the U.S. Department of Education issued Grand Canyon Education with a $37.7 million fine over similar claims. According to the department, less than 2% of the school's doctoral program graduates completed their program within the advertised cost, with nearly 80% of these students taking at least five continuation courses.\n\nSince staging a convincing break above a key area of resistance around $120, the LOPE share price has continued to grind higher. However, apart from the initial wide-ranging day in early November, the move has occurred on lower-than-average trading volumes, indicating a lack of buying conviction. If news-related selling takes place, keep an eye on the previous $120 resistance level, which may now turn into a key area of support on the chart.\n\nIovance Biotherapeutics, Inc.\n\nSource: TradingView.com.\n\nCancer immunotherapy company Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA) plunged 18.7% on Wednesday after announcing that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has halted its experimental cell therapy in lung cancer patients following the death of patient. The setback could potentially pause the trial for months, delaying the biotech\u2019s plans to develop a successful therapy to treat non-small cell lung cancer. \"Beyond the time it takes to actually resolve the clinical hold, it is possible that the hold results in recruitment losing momentum, potentially exacerbating the delay to data,\" Truist analyst Asthika Goonewardene wrote in a client note cited by Reuters. Although Iovance uses the same therapy to treat melanoma, the FDA\u2019s pause will have no impact on any other trials, the company said.\n\nAfter bottoming out in late October, IOVA has staged an impressive rally to now trade above the 200-day moving average. Although the stock gapped sharply lower on yesterday\u2019s open, it closed well above its session lows, indicating that some investors saw the sell-off as a dip-buying opportunity. However, if further selling occurs, monitor the area between $5 and $6 on the chart, which may find support from a previous downtrend line and the 50-day moving average.\n\nEthereum\n\nSource: TradingView.com.\n\nEthereum gained over 6% on Wednesday as investors repositioned into the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization ahead of several notable events taking place in January. The blockchain-based network is undergoing a significant upgrade next month that\u2019s expected to reduce costs across its infrastructure, such as minimizing fees on its layer 2 solutions. Investors also anticipate a decision in January from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Many crypto investors are of the belief that the securities watchdog would shortly thereafter green stamp a spot Ethereum ETF. Over the past month Ethereum has significantly underperformed other leading cryptocurrencies, such as Solana and Avax.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has continued to trend higher since the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average in late November to form a golden cross\u2014a pattern that investors typically interpret as marking the start of a new bull market. More recently, the price has broken out from a pennant pattern indicating a continuation of the current uptrend. If Ether continues to climb, it\u2019s worth monitoring important chart levels around $3,300 and $3,550, which may provide resistance from several key horizontal trendlines. Alternatively, a breakdown below the pattern could indicate a potential bull trap and change in trend direction.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "The Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) update scheduled for early 2024 aims to improve the efficiency, scalability, and security of the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Ethereum network has confirmed an upcoming update to its network in early 2024, dubbed \u201cDencun.\u201d The Dencun upgrade will increase the efficiency, scalability, and security of the Ethereum network by improving operation and decreasing gas fees via a process referred to as Proto-Danksharding and a collection of other Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).\n\nRead on for a detailed walkthrough of the Dencun update.\n\nWhat Is the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Update?\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (or Dencun) update is the next significant upgrade to the Ethereum network after the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nDencun is a fusion of the Cancun and Deneb upgrades. The Cancun upgrade will be to Ethereum\u2019s execution layer, while the Deneb upgrade will be to the consensus layer. The Deneb upgrade will complement the Cancun upgrade to complete the Dencun upgrade.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will attempt to address the unresolved issues facing the Ethereum network, including security and scalability, following the Shanghai update.\n\nEthereum network upgrades are usually implemented through a hard fork that touches on different parts of the network. The Cancun update will involve a major upgrade for the two Ethereum layers.\n\nThe Cancun upgrade will focus on the proposed modifications by five different EIPs to enhance various aspects of the network\u2019s execution layer (Layer 1).\n\nThe Deneb update will complement the Cancun update to achieve the Dencun upgrade and will be more focused on Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer (Layer 2).\n\nThe Cancun-Deneb upgrade is expected to grow the speed of Ethereum\u2019s transaction per second (TPS), allowing for increased traffic on the network while preserving decentralization. This upgrade shows that Ethereum is on course with its tiered roadmap phase of \u2018The Surge\u2019 that aims to scale the network\u2019s TPS to 100,000.\n\nAll the proposed modifications are designed to reduce gas fees and increase Ethereum\u2019s throughput.\n\nEthereum Cancun EIPs Explained\n\nThe impending Ethereum Cancun-Deneb upgrade encompasses several Ethereum Improvement Proposals that are key in advancing the network. These EIP updates serve various purposes, like reducing operational costs on the Ethereum blockchain and improving the network\u2019s data storage proficiency.\n\nThe Cancun upgrade will feature the following critical EIPs:\n\nEIP-2322: This will target Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer by introducing an update to Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, making it more efficient and robust.\n\nEIP-4844 : The Cancun update will be centered around this proposal, which will oversee the implementation of Proto-Danksharding. This EIP will increase Ethereum\u2019s transactional throughput, which will, in turn, boost the network\u2019s scalability.\n\nEIP-1153 : This proposal will reduce the cost of data storage while optimizing block space.\n\nEIP-4788 : Proposes an improvement to the infrastructure of cross-chain bridges and staking pools, thus enhancing functionality and security.\n\nEIP-5656 : Suggests minor yet important code changes to EVM for enhanced performance.\n\nEIP-6780 : Aims to enhance security by eliminating the SELFDESTRUCT code function that can potentially discontinue smart contracts.\n\nUltimately, all these EIPs are part of a bigger vision to make Ethereum a much more attractive ecosystem for both developers and users by decreasing gas fees while increasing throughput.\n\nBenefits of Ethereum Dencun Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun update is expected to bring with it multiple benefits to the Ethereum ecosystem and network. Besides solving the most common issues, such as scalability and security, it will also potentially open up Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem to new use cases and more users.\n\nIn addition, the upgrade will offer both developers and users a more user-friendly and seamless experience by enhancing security, improving cross-chain communication and data storage, optimizing gas fees, and tackling scalability issues.\n\nThe proposed changes in EIP-5656 will also lay the foundation for the network\u2019s future technical advancements.\n\nPotential Risks of the Dencun Upgrade\n\nJust like with past upgrades, the Dencun upgrade might have some potential risks. One such potential risk is tied to the impact the update will have on the already existing smart contracts, as introducing new changes and features could create compatibility issues.\n\nIntegration is also another potential risk. The Dencun upgrade aims to improve data storage to enhance efficiency. However, there\u2019s no guarantee that the data migration will be seamless and not cause any issues to ongoing operations, as this requires proper planning and execution.\n\nAs a major network upgrade, there\u2019s a need for Ethereum developers to conduct extensive testing during the implementation phase to guarantee a smooth transition while ensuring all stakeholders stay well-informed about the risks to avoid any potential backlash from the community.\n\nWhen Is the Dencun Update Going Live?\n\nNo specific date has been announced for when the Dencun update will go live. However, it\u2019s expected that the upgrade will happen in early 2024.\n\nThe upgrade had previously been planned to go live in October 2023. This changed after a discussion that was had at the All Core Developer Consensus in November 2023."

        "content": "The Dec. 28 blog post reiterated the core values of Ethereum, harking back to its early days when it was more \u201ccypherpunk.\u201d\n\nThe early vision of Bitcoin and Ethereum was deeply idealistic, aiming to build a more open, decentralized, and censorship-resistant internet and economy.\n\nHowever, Buterin lamented that over time, this vision faded as transaction fees rose, making applications focused on payments and speculation more dominant. The culture shifted toward \u201cdegen gamblers,\u201d he added.\n\nCypherpunk is a movement advocating the use of technology to promote privacy and social change while protecting against state or corporate oppression.\n\nEthereum Back to its Roots\n\nNevertheless, there have been signs of a culture revival in 2023 due to rollups reducing fees, advances in privacy technology like zk-proofs, and a desire to move beyond over-financialization, he said.\n\nEthereum could be a testbed for open and decentralized security innovations like social recovery wallets, prediction markets, and quadratic voting, which could later influence the broader internet.\n\nMoreover, the ideal future Web3 tech stack contains decentralized equivalents to DNS, email, payments, identities, publishing, and governance that interoperate while avoiding central points of control, said Buterin.\n\nHe concluded that many come to crypto to get rich but become decentralization converts when they realize what the technology is capable of.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of people whose first introduction to the crypto space is the desire to get rich, but who then get acquainted with the ecosystem and become avid believers in the quest to build a more open and decentralized world.\u201d\n\nButerin has been busy blogging lately. Earlier this week, he proposed measures to reduce the load on the Ethereum blockchain by reducing the number of cryptographic signatures that validators need to produce.\n\nIn May, he warned of the dangers of stretching Ethereum\u2019s consensus past its core functions of validating blocks and securing the network.\n\nETH Price Doubles in 2023\n\nEthereum prices have perked up this week, reaching a 2023 high of $2,430 on Dec. 28. The asset has largely trailed Bitcoin and competing blockchain tokens such as Solana and Avalanche in recent months.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is the world\u2019s second-largest crypto asset and the industry standard for smart contracts. Moreover, it has doubled in price since the beginning of the year when it was trading at just $1,200.\n\nFinally, ETH prices could surge to $15,000 in the next bull market, according to analysts who have measured gains from previous cycles and projected them forward."

ETH is correcting gains, but the bulls might remain active near the $2,300 and $2,240 support levels.\n\nEthereum is correcting gains and trading below the $2,400 level.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a bullish flag forming with resistance near $2,360 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a fresh increase if there is a close above the $2,400 level.\n\nEthereum Price Remains Supported\n\nEthereum price climbed higher above the $2,320 resistance zone. ETH even broke the $2,400 level before the bears appeared. A high was formed near $2,441 before the price started a downside correction, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the $2,400 and $2,380 levels. The price declined and tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,180 swing low to the $2,441 high. The bulls seem to be active near the $2,320 support zone.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $2,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,360 level. There is also a bullish flag forming with resistance near $2,360 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe first major resistance is now near $2,400. A close above the $2,400 resistance could send the price toward $2,440. The next key resistance is near $2,500. A clear move above the $2,500 zone could start another increase. The next resistance sits at $2,620, above which Ethereum might rally and test the $2,750 zone.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,400 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,320 level and the 100 hourly SMA.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,240 zone or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,180 swing low to the $2,441 high. A downside break and a close below $2,240 might start another major decline. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,165 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,120 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now near the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,320\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,400\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Proposes Simplified Ethereum Proof of Stake Design - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Proposes Simplified Ethereum Proof of Stake Design\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed three alternative methods aimed at simplifying the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s proof of stake design.\n\nThis initiative, according to Buterin\u2019s latest blog post, is intended to address a potential systemic complexity within Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism. The proposals center on reducing the number of signatures required per slot in the blockchain.\n\nAccording to Buterin, Ethereum is currently supporting 895,000 validator objects for decentralization, processing about 28,000 signatures in a single day and 1,790,000 post-SSF. His detailed idea intended to reduce the load to 8,192 signatures per slot post-SSF.\n\nEthereum Proof of Stake Simplification Proposal\n\n\n\nButerin\u2019s first proposal, the shift towards decentralized staking pools, aims to simplify the proof of stake process by reducing the number of individual validators. This approach requires increasing the minimum ether required for staking, thereby compelling smaller validators to form pools.\n\nA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 27, 2023\n\n\u201cWe could raise the min deposit size to 4,096 ETH and make a total cap of 4,096 validators,\u201d said Buterin.\n\nThe second proposal introduces a dual-layer of stakers to ensure network security and efficiency. Buterin explained this as creating \u201ca \u2018heavy\u2019 layer with a 4,096 ETH requirement that participates in finalization, and a \u2018light\u2019 layer with no minimum.\u201d\n\nButerin\u2019s third proposal, involving a rotating set of validators, is designed to distribute the validation process more evenly across the network. He suggests, \u201cFor each slot, we choose 4,096 currently active validators, and we carefully adjust that set during each slot in such a way that we still have safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy Not Just Do Committees\u201d\n\n\n\nVitalik Buterin highlighted the limitations of the committee-based security model used by other blockchains. This model, which selects a group of validators randomly for each slot, lacks accountability in case of a 51% attack. In such an attack, the economic cost to the perpetrators is minimal since most validators involved in the attack remain unseen, not being chosen for the committee.\n\nContrastingly, Ethereum\u2019s current system imposes severe penalties for similar attacks, slashing a large fraction of the attacking validators\u2019 deposits. While Ethereum\u2019s high penalty approach is effective, it might be excessively punitive. So a balanced solution that still maintains a high total amount of slashable Ethereum but makes some concessions on validator accountability would be the answer."

        "title": "Vitalik wants Ethereum to be more 'Cypherpunk' hailing the social layer as its core USP - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared his insights on the evolving landscape of the crypto ecosystem on Dec. 29, mainly focusing on Ethereum\u2019s role in shaping a more open and decentralized internet in a blog post entitled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again.\u201d\n\nSince its inception, Ethereum has journeyed beyond being a mere extension of Bitcoin with smart contracts. Buterin recalls early memories of using Bitcoin in Berlin\u2019s Bitcoin Kiez and at PorcFest, a libertarian gathering, highlighting the intertwined nature of technological and social aspects in the crypto world. These experiences stress the broader vision of crypto: fostering a free, open society where technology, social, and economic elements harmoniously interact.\n\nThe initial concept of \u201cweb3,\u201d as coined by Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Gavin Wood, envisioned Ethereum as a fundamental component of a more open internet stack. This vision aimed to overcome the limitations of the free, open-source software movement of the 1980s and \u201990s, which did not account for modern internet applications\u2019 collaborative and centralized nature. Ethereum, along with technologies like peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage, was seen as a decentralized, shared hard drive crucial for extending the spirit of open source into today\u2019s interconnected world. For Buterin, the chart below outlines the core benefits of decentralized technologies.\n\nHowever, Buterin notes a shift in focus since around 2017, with a diminished emphasis on consumer crypto payments and non-financial applications. This shift is partly attributed to rising transaction fees on the Ethereum network, which have priced out more minor, non-financial uses in favor of financial applications dominated by speculative activities. According to Buterin, this change has led to a misalignment with the original vision of Ethereum and the broader crypto space.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, Buterin highlights several positive developments in Ethereum\u2019s technology that could steer the platform back toward its foundational principles. These include advancements in rollups, second-generation privacy solutions, account abstraction, light clients, and zero-knowledge proofs. These technologies address the challenge of scalability and embody the values of decentralization, censorship resistance, and open participation.\n\nAs part of a broader technological vision, Buterin states, Ethereum continues developing its original components and \u201csister technologies\u201d such as decentralized messaging and decentralized storage. Introducing zero-knowledge proofs adds a new dimension, enabling privacy and authentication simultaneously. For instance, Buterin notes how Zupass, a zero-knowledge-proof-based system, successfully implemented anonymous voting, demonstrating the potential of Ethereum-based technologies in achieving privacy without sacrificing security.\n\n\u201cWe can start to see the contours of what an Ethereum-y cypherpunk world would look like, at least on a pure technical level. We can be holding our assets in ETH and ERC20 tokens, as well as all kinds of NFTs, and use privacy systems based on stealth addresses and Privacy Pools technology to preserve our privacy while at the same time locking out known bad actors\u2019 ability to benefit from the same anonymity set.\u201d\n\nButerin also emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s role in developing a decentralized tech protocol stack, competing with traditional centralized systems. This stack includes banking, social media, and identity verification alternatives, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s commitment to building tools that interoperate with a broader ecosystem rather than creating isolated empires.\n\nThe social layer of Ethereum is equally crucial, according to Buterin. He acknowledges the need for a balance between incentive-driven and community-oriented approaches. Large-scale public goods funding and cooperative efforts within the Ethereum ecosystem are steps toward this balance, yet there is much room for growth and improvement.\n\n\u201cThere is a unqiue mix of valuing a warm and cohesive community, but at the same time remembering that what feels \u201cwarm and cohesive\u201d from the inside can easily feel \u201coppressive and exclusive\u201d from the outside, and valuing hard norms of neutrality, open source and censorship resistance as a way of guarding against the risks of going too far in being community-driven.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Buterin envisions Ethereum as a platform that excels technically and economically and fosters a robust and value-driven community. Buterin closes his post by stating,\n\n\u201cIf this mix can be made to work well, it will in turn be in the best possible position to realize its vision on the economic and technical level.\u201d\n\nButerin believes integrating technical innovation with social and ethical principles could potentially lead Ethereum to realize its original vision of a decentralized, open, and equitable digital world."

        "title": "Ethereum outlook 2024: institutional adoption, oil wealth, and L2 expansion - KITCO",
        "content": "(Kitco News) - 2023 was a year of recovery for the cryptocurrency market after the events of 2022 \u2013 including the collapse of Terra/Luna and FTX \u2013 resulted in the total crypto market cap falling by $2.27 trillion, a decline of more than 75% from its peak in November 2021.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-ranked crypto by market cap, mirrored the decline in the broader market, with its price falling from a high of $4,850 in Nov. 2021 to $1,190 on Jan. 1, 2023, a decline of 75.5%.\n\nSince then, Ether has more than doubled in price, hitting a 2023 high of $2,405 on Dec. 9. ETH has been bolstered by the start of the next bull market cycle for cryptocurrencies and optimism around the potential approval of the first spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) after multiple large asset managers, including BlackRock, filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\"The fate of a spot Ethereum ETF looms large,\" said Daniel Krupka, head of research at Coin Bureau. \"A successful ETF approval could lead to significant institutional investment, potentially driving ETH's price higher. However, concerns around censorship resistance if the ETF is staked need to be addressed.\"\n\n\"Centralization within the staking ecosystem requires careful monitoring,\" he said. \"Lido Finance's dominance in staked ETH raises concerns about potential control and manipulation.\"\n\nKrupka identified Ethereum's layer-2 (L2) fragmentation as a potential headwind. \"Ensuring interoperability between different layer 2 solutions is crucial for Ethereum's long-term scalability and adoption,\" he said.\n\nDespite those concerns, Krupka said, \"Ethereum's position as the leading proof-of-stake blockchain remains a significant advantage. This inherent security is likely to attract institutional investors, particularly if competitors encounter scalability and security issues.\"\n\nBased on this understanding, Coin Bureau's analysis suggests Ether's price \"could reach its previous all-time high of approximately $4,890 by the end of 2024,\" he said.\n\n\"Ethereum's outlook for 2024 hinges on institutional adoption, fueled by the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF,\" Krupka said. \"While Ethereum faces challenges like layer 2 fragmentation and centralization concerns, its inherent security remains a key draw for institutional investors.\"\n\n\"ETH's main catalyst going into 2024 will be its own ETF,\" said Johnny Gabriele, head of decentralized finance at CryptoOracle. \"It has already been filed, and the second the Bitcoin ETF is approved, the narrative will instantly shift to the ETH version driving the same price action the Bitcoin enjoyed in November and December.\"\n\n\"Once that happens, activity on the L1 and its many L2s will cause a lot of ETH to be burned (a mechanism put into place after 'The 'Merge'),\" he said. \"This will further draw attention to the asset and drive the staking yield to above 5%.\"\n\n\"A third narrative of tokenizing Real World Assets will bring even more institutional and retail players into the ecosystem, allowing Ethereum to blow past all-time highs,\" Gabriele said. \"Ethereum will hit $8,000 in 2024 and shoot well past $10,000 in 2025 before a blow-off top starts the next bear market.\"\n\nOil and Ethereum\n\nGuy Gotslak, co-founder and president of My Digital Money, said that while many analysts are focused on the ETH ETF talk, there is \"one critical game-changer\" that many are overlooking: oil.\n\n\"The TLDR version is that the oil industry of the Middle East could end up fully operating in the Ethereum blockchain,\" he said. \"UAE, Saudi Arabia, and neighboring oil-heavy nations account for more than 20% of global oil exports. I don't have to discuss the importance of oil.\"\n\nGotslak noted that in 2022, \"a Saudi Arabian [used] Ethereum to pay for a Mercedes Benz S580 from USA-based Jeff Wyler Automotive,\" and that \"The process was said to have been faster than any wire transfer.\"\n\n\"While many may credit this to being a novelty transaction, the Middle East has been making concrete steps towards the blockchain,\" he said. \"It hosted ETH Riyadh 2023, a conference dedicated to the Ethereum ecosystem and blockchain technology. The conference gathered developers and builders from Saudi and other regions in the Middle East.\"\n\nHe added that Dubai has also \"started digitizing itself to ensure the efficiency of all government offices and to provide both local and visitor experiences with quick and efficient responses to needs. This will be made possible by using the blockchain and artificial intelligence,\" he said.\n\n\"Their goal is to 'achieve efficiency by using blockchain in 100% of applicable government services, creating and enabling blockchain ecosystem for startups and businesses, and to become a global thought leader by piloting cross-border blockchain cases,'\" Gotslak said.\n\nPart of this effort includes the goal of going paperless, and \"all transaction, retail, wholesale, and government-controlled industries such as oil, will operate in the Ethereum blockchain.\"\n\n\"This is not just 'big,' this is a seismic shift in the global financial industry and the Ethereum blockchain will be at the center of it,\" Gotslak concluded.\n\nImprovements to the network\n\nVince Yang, founder of zkLink, said: \"All signs are signaling upside for Ethereum as the market shows spillover demand from the recent Bitcoin rally.\"\n\nHe noted that digital asset investment inflows are now at the highest level since Oct. 2021, with more than $1.76 billion flowing into these products over the past ten weeks, and \"20% of that moving into Ether.\"\n\n\"Ethereum's open interest has also risen above the $8 bn level,\" a development that has not been seen since last November, he added.\n\n\"On a fundamental level, demand continues to surge for the most profitable chain as Ethereum's TVL has risen from $21 billion in October to $32 billion,\" Yang said. \"The tech has also transitioned to full Proof of Stake (PoS) this cycle and no longer burns energy to produce blockspace. PoS also makes Ethereum deflationary to the tune of around 0.5% a year and existing Ethereum validators are earning 5.3% a year.\"\n\nHe also pointed to Ethereum's \"thriving ecosystem of blockspace buyers in the form of Layer-2 networks, applications, and users,\" highlighting that \"Five whole L2 blockchains are in the top 10 consumers of ETH blockspace, making them responsible for adoption and stimulating on-chain activities, thus increasing demand for ETH.\"\n\nYang said the thing that could potentially hinder Ethereum's growth would be if a spot ETH ETF was not approved this cycle, which would lead to Ether's price and adoption lagging behind Bitcoin.\n\nHe also identified a recession in the U.S. economy as a potential headwind. \"Recently, there has been almost $200bn liquidity injected into the U.S. economy, causing RRPs to fall while TGA remains unchanged,\" Yang said. \"Though this may not look bad, the practice of spiking liquidity is not sustainable in the long run for any economy. A recession could cause a re-factoring of all assets and we might not get the fairy tale ending we would like to see for crypto, let alone Ethereum.\"\n\nPelli Wang, co-founder of Bracket Labs, noted that ETH is \"relatively undervalued compared with BTC\" as its price has not increased as much throughout 2023.\n\n\"Moreover, there has been endless speculation for the BTC ETF approval, but there has been more muted discussion about the ETH ETF approval even though many large enterprises are building pilots and other use cases on ETH,\" she said. \"Therefore, I think there is a good potential for ETH to double to $5,000 by the end of 2024.\"\n\nAlan Scott, contributor at RAILGUN, said he thinks 2024 will \"continue to see deep value enter into the Ethereum ecosystem.\"\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of pivoting and repositioning of 'Alternative L1s' moving towards being L2s,\" he said. \"Since 'The Merge' (the switch to Proof of Stake), we've seen a net burn of ~300k-ish ETH. Many alt-L1s positioned themselves as 'ETH Killers,' but have come to realize Ethereum's death may never come. So, we've seen many blockchains start to position themselves as Ethereum L2s. This only adds to the value proposition of ETH.\"\n\n\"If I were forced to give a price guess, I would guess around the $6,000-$8,000 range,\" Scott said. \"Ether scarcity will play a factor in ETH pricing.\"\n\nJeff Owens, co-founder of Haven1, said the upcoming Dencun upgrade \"is likely to be a major catalyst for the ecosystem and ETH in Q1 2024.\"\n\nOwens said the core aspects of the Dencun upgrade include \"five critical Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), with EIP-4844 being the primary focus.\"\n\n\"EIP-4844 is a leap in scalability,\" he said. \"Known as proto-danksharding, this EIP aims to expand the blockchain's capacity by integrating data 'blobs,' which are projected to significantly lower gas fees for layer 2 rollups.\"\n\n\"Proto-danksharding is poised to draw more users to Ethereum, especially through rollups, and will help catalyze layer-2 adoption,\" he said. \"With over 90% of L2 transaction costs tied to L1 data storage, EIP-4844's data blobs are expected to slash L2 fees by at least ten times. Despite its technical complexity, the result will be straightforward for users - they will likely pay only a fraction of the current cost for L2 transactions, widening access.\"\n\nOwens said that the expansion of transactions on L2's made possible by proto-danksharding \"will likely cause a surge in transactions, especially with optimistic rollups already surpassing Ethereum mainnet in volume, boosting the overall economic activity on Ethereum.\"\n\n\"Although lower L2 fees might temporarily reduce ETH burning, the overall growth in Ethereum's transactional activity is expected to enhance its value in the medium term,\" he said.\n\nWhen it comes to headwinds on Ethereum's path forward, Owens highlighted regulatory challenges, technical setbacks, and network congestion.\n\n\"Any delays or technical issues in these upgrades could negatively impact investor confidence,\" he said. \"The network will still have issues when there are periods of high demand,\" which will continue to be perceived as a negative by many users.\n\n\"The Dencun upgrade, coupled with increasing excitement around Ethereum ETFs, is expected to sustain a bullish trend in Ethereum's price into Q1 2024,\" Owens concluded.\n\n\"We believe that upgrades to Ethereum relating to scalability will steal the show in 2024,\" said Jesper Johansen, founder and CEO of Northstake. \"As user adoption of Ethereum grows, the protocol will need to scale its operational capacity to facilitate more network transactions.\n\nProjects and integrations that increase the scalability of Ethereum's protocol will be one of the primary value drivers for ETH in 2024.\"\n\n\"Ethereum is as important and foundational to the growth of Web3 as large language models (LLMs) are for the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies,\" he said. \"When investors fully understand the implications of how Ethereum changes the way we transact online, Ethereum will grow and become increasingly valuable.\"\n\nPavel Matveev, co-founder and CEO of Wirex, also sees the Ether burn mechanism as a positive force on ETH price, along with a rising interest in derivatives and the token's correlation with Bitcoin (BTC).\n\n\"The supply of Ether turned deflationary again,\" Matveev said. \"About a month ago, the total supply of Ether started shrinking, dropping by over 44,000 ETH in the last 30 days. This reflects mostly the higher transaction activity observed on-chain: volumes are up and holding near the highest levels observed this semester.\"\n\n\"The interest in Ether derivatives is currently very high, reaching levels close to the highest point this year,\" he added. \"This suggests that more people are getting involved in the market. Ether also remains highly correlated with BTC and still plays an important role in diversifying a cryptocurrency portfolio.\"\n\nThat said, Matveev noted that \"the price of Ether has been underperforming Bitcoin's since June,\" as far more attention has been paid to the spot BTC ETF applications than the spot ETH\n\nETF applications\n\n\"Even though there are applications for Ether ETFs, they are still scarce, and would face a whole different challenge: the SEC treatment of PoS protocol native tokens has yet to be clarified,\" he said. \"The question is: are staking services turning PoS tokens into securities?\n\nIf uncertainty remains, more centralized exchanges could shut down or stay away from staking activities.\"\n\nBased on these factors, Matveev said a moderate price prediction for Ether at the end of Feb. 2024 is $2,700, and $4,000 by June.\n\nAnd Jamie Turner, head of marketing at Neon EVM, sees ETH hitting a price of $2,500 by the end of 2023 and exceeding $3,000 by the end of 2024 as \"all signs indicate that 2024 will be a bull run year.\"\n\nTurner identified stability brought by the release of new regulations in the U.S., E.U., and U.K. as the main catalyst that will bolster the price of ETH and the broader crypto market.\n\n"

        "content": "While there have been talks about Ethereum (ETH) staying dud for a while, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency is now making big moves. In the last 24 hours, the Ethereum (ETH) price has jumped by 9% currently trading at $2,424 levels with a market cap of $291 billion.\n\nEthereum Gears Up for 2024 Price Rally\n\nMarket analysts have been predicting that 2024 will be the year for Ethereum, and it shall close the gap with the Bitcoin market dominance.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn a recent surge, the long-dormant Ethereum (ETH) experienced a notable rally, surpassing the $2,400 mark and establishing a new high for the year. This rally has resulted in all major term implied volatilities (IVs) reaching yearly highs, while the 30-day volatility (DVOL) has soared to 70%, marking a new peak since April, reports, Greeks.Live.\n\nDespite this bullish movement, options data from Skew indicates that institutional traders have not yet joined the rally, maintaining recent levels without following the upward trend. The absence of institutional FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) suggests a cautious approach among these traders.\n\nAs highlighted in recent discussions, the year-end period is characterized by tight liquidity, making the market susceptible to sudden spikes and falls. Investors are navigating this environment with a focus on options purchases that offer a favorable breakeven ratio.\n\nEthereum Favorable Over Bitcoin for Q1 2024\n\nSo far, Bitcoin has dominated the crypto market rally during the fourth quarter of the year. On the other hand, while Ethereum has progressed, it has failed to keep up pace with Bitcoin.\n\nBut market analysts believe that Ethereum will lead the crypto market rally going into 2024. Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has suggested a historical pattern may be unfolding, indicating a peak in Bitcoin dominance before the upcoming Bitcoin halving. According to van de Poppe, this trend typically marks the commencement of a bull market for altcoins, with Ethereum expected to play a prominent role in this phase.\n\nApart from just ETH, the entire Ethereum ecosystem is heating up with Arbitrum and Optimism taking the lead as well. On the other hand, the Ethereum development is working on reducing the PoS complexity with founder Vitalik Buterin proposing some key solutions."

        "title": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin Proposes Signature Reduction - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposes reducing the number of signatures for validators in the PoS system to simplify the system, address technical issues, and enhance network security.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder, recently proposed a significant change to the Ethereum blockchain's proof-of-stake (PoS) system. The core of his proposal is to reduce the number of signatures that validators must process. Currently, Ethereum's PoS mechanism involves around 895,000 validators processing approximately 28,000 signatures per slot, which results in a heavy load on the network\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe Need for Change: Balancing Decentralization and Efficiency\n\nThis high number of validators and the associated signature load come with major technical downsides. It limits quantum resistance, complicates forking, and challenges scaling signatures through zero-knowledge proofs (SNARKs). Moreover, the high minimum of 32 ETH for becoming a validator remains prohibitive for many, limiting widespread participation\u200b\u200b.\n\nButerin suggests that reducing the signature requirement to about 8,192 per slot, down from the current 28,000, would offer several benefits. It would simplify the consensus mechanism, make the blockchain more quantum-resistant, and maintain a high total of slashable ETH (1-2 million ETH), a mechanism to enforce good behavior among validators\u200b\u200b.\n\nExploring Alternative Approaches: Decentralized Staking Pools and More\n\nButerin outlined three potential approaches for this change:\n\nDecentralized Staking Pools: This method involves increasing the minimum ether required for staking, encouraging smaller validators to form pools. This shift would reduce the number of individual validators\u200b\u200b. Dual-Layer Staking System: A 'heavy' layer would require a higher ETH stake (4,096 ETH) for participation in finalization processes, while a 'light' layer would have no minimum requirement, creating a balance between security and accessibility\u200b\u200b. Rotating Validator Set: This approach would involve a rotating set of 4,096 validators for each slot, adjusting the set during each slot to ensure network safety\u200b\u200b.\n\nAddressing Security Concerns\n\nButerin also pointed out the limitations of the committee-based security model used in other blockchains. This model, which randomly selects a group of validators for each slot, lacks accountability in the event of a 51% attack. Ethereum's current system, which imposes severe penalties for such attacks, is effective but might be excessively punitive. A balanced solution maintaining high slashable Ethereum while making concessions on validator accountability is needed\u200b\u200b.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "title": "What Are Native Tokens? - Cryptocurrency - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Are Native Tokens?\n\nThe term \"native token\" is used to refer to a token that is created on a specific blockchain. In the past, the term was used to refer to the original token made for a blockchain that had an internal use. However, it has since morphed to include any tokens that are made on that blockchain.\n\nA few examples of native tokens are bitcoin, ether, and the stablecoin USDC, created by Centre, a partnership between Coinbase and Circle. USDC is native to several blockchains or supporting layers.\n\nKey Takeaways Native tokens are the tokens on a blockchain created originally for that blockchain.\n\nNative tokens can also be additional tokens created on a blockchain.\n\n\n\nExamples of native tokens include ether (ETH), bitcoin (BTC), stellar (XLM), and solana (SOL).\n\nNon-native tokens are not created on a specific blockchain but can be used on it.\n\nUnderstanding Native Tokens\n\nWhen a blockchain is developed, it is generally created to address a specific issue. For instance, the Bitcoin blockchain and its native token, bitcoin, were created to be a payment system, using a reward mechanism as an incentive for securing the blockchain. Ethereum was designed to be a system on which other applications could be designed, using ether as the reward for work done for the blockchain. At the time, and for several years, tokens like these were considered native tokens.\n\nBut it's important to understand that with cryptocurrency, definitions and concepts change over time because it is still in its infancy. As of December 2023, a native token is one that is created and stored on a particular blockchain. Its purpose or utility doesn't matter as long as it was minted on that blockchain. A token that wasn't minted on a specific blockchain is not native to that blockchain. These are usually called non-native tokens.\n\nNative Tokens and Forks\n\nThe token of a forked blockchain is also a native token because forking projects generally create a new blockchain and token from the old one. A fork is a change in a blockchain that some users accept but not others. The ones that accept the change run the new blockchain, and the ones that don't accept it run the version it was forked from.\n\nThe blockchain and token might be replicas of the old chain, but they will be named something different, making the token on that chain a native token because it was minted on the forked blockchain.\n\nExamples of Native Tokens\n\nNotable examples of native tokens are bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano\u2019s native token (ADA), and USDC.\n\nUSDC is a stablecoin originally created by Coinbase and Circle on the Ethereum blockchain. It is pegged to the dollar with a reserve equal to the amount of circulating USDC (held by BlackRock). By the old definition, it was not a native token because it had no internal use on the blockchain. However, the stablecoin is now minted (issued or created) and backed by Circle on many other blockchains, making it one cryptocurrency native to many chains.\n\nAs of Dec. 28, 2023, USDC was native to Algorand, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Flow, Hedera, NEAR, Noble, OP Mainnet, Polkadot, Polygon PoS, Solana, Stellar, and TRON.\n\nWrapped bitcoin (WBTC) is a bitcoin that has been tokenized (given a token) on the Ethereum blockchain via a smart contract. The bitcoin is sent to a custodial address controlled by a smart contract, and a WBTC is created on the Ethereum blockchain that represents a 1:1 bitcoin value.\n\nWBTC can then be used in Ethereum decentralized applications. Once someone wants to convert it back to bitcoin (BTC), it is sent to an address on the Ethereum network that burns the WBTC, and the smart contract transfers the bitcoin to the owner. This is the same process USDC uses to transfer value\u2014it uses smart contracts to burn the USDC on the Ethereum blockchain and mint a token on the target one. If USDC is native to targeted blockchains, then WBTC is native to Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Is a Coin vs. a Native Token? Some use the term \"coin\" to refer to a cryptocurrency. A native token is a token created on the blockchain it is used and stored on.\n\nIs Ethereum a Native Token? Ethereum's token ether (ETH) is a native token because it was created for the ecosystem and used in it.\n\nIs ADA a Native Token? Yes. ADA is the original token for the Solana blockchain, which was one of the first blockchains to use proof-of-stake.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNative tokens are created and stored on a specific blockchain or its supporting layers. This definition differs from past definitions because the industry is still in its infancy and changing.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin has voiced a new vision for the Ethereum platform that seeks to address its most pressing challenges and leverage emerging technologies to reinvent Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure. Central to this vision is a renewed focus on scalability and privacy, fueled by the development of layer-2 solutions and novel privacy technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin acknowledges probably the biggest issue on the network right now \u2013 high fees. This barrier has not only hindered widespread adoption but also skewed the network toward financial applications, as only users with significant resources can afford to transact during peak times. The proposed solution to this predicament lies in the advancement of rollups. Rollups perform transaction execution outside the main Ethereum chain (layer 1) but post transaction data to layer 1, thereby enhancing the network\u2019s capacity while retaining its security.\n\nThe advent of rollups, particularly optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups, has been a primary way of reducing fees on the network. These rollups promise to execute a large number of transactions at a fraction of the cost currently required on the main chain, potentially lowering the entry barrier for new users and diverse applications.\n\nAccount abstraction is another key component of Buterin's vision. It represents a shift in how user accounts and transactions are managed, offering a more flexible and user-friendly model that could open up new possibilities for application developers.\n\nLight clients, which have been on the backburner for some time, are now closer to fruition. Their role is crucial for enabling users to interact with the Ethereum network without running full nodes, thereby lowering the technical barriers to entry and participation.\n\nThe most groundbreaking development highlighted by Buterin is the practical application of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Once considered a distant future technology, ZKPs are now increasingly developer-friendly and on the verge of consumer application. This technology could revolutionize privacy and scalability on Ethereum by allowing users to validate transactions without revealing underlying information."

        "title": "3 reasons why Ethereum (ETH) price nearly broke the $2.5K resistance this week - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum network, has risen by 5.5% since Dec. 27, even though it failed to break above the $2,400 resistance. Traders are now questioning what has been driving the price of Ether up and whether these factors remain of importance.\n\nEther price reaches a 19-month high as traders anticipate a rally above $2,500\n\nThe intraday high of $2,446 on Dec. 28 was last seen over 19 months ago. This increase occurred while the broader cryptocurrency market capitalization remained flat at $1.68 trillion. This suggests that Ether\u2019s price could continue its bullish momentum toward $2,500, despite the average transaction fee exceeding $5. While this may not seem excessive, it can be burdensome for most decentralized application (DApp) users.\n\nOne can easily fall for the narratives that competing chains are gaining relevance, as critics claim that the Ethereum network has failed due to its limited capacity for scaling and privacy solutions at the base layer level. This negative conversation has been heightened by the recent outperformance of Solana\u2019s SOL (SOL) and Binance\u2019s BNB (BNB), which have gained 78% and 44%, respectively, in the past 30 days. As an example, an experienced Solana ecosystem developer, Matty Taylor, posted about this issue on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nSome info for anyone pushing the narrative that Ethereum is best positioned to become the RWA/institutional chain:\n\n\n\nTradFi institutions are even more sensitive than memecoin traders to fees, speed & overall infra performance.\n\n\n\nSee why Visa chose @Solana.https://t.co/tNGpgvNekG \u2014 mattytay (@mattytay) December 28, 2023\n\nHowever, this analysis fails to consider the undeniable success of Ethereum layer-2 blockchains and the dominance of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Moreover, the Ethereum network\u2019s total value locked (TVL) of $29.6 billion invalidates much of the negative assessment. In comparison, BNB Chain holds a mere $3.6 billion TVL, while Solana\u2019s latest data stands at $1.4 billion, according to DefiLlama.\n\nOne might argue that not every DApp requires a huge TVL, and even the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry is working to maximize the usage of its deposits. Therefore, other metrics such as transactions and the number of active addresses are better suited to measure adoption.\n\nBlockchains ranked by 7-day DApp volumes, USD. Source: DappRadar\n\nApart from its absolute layer-1 dominance, the Ethereum network has posted a 38% growth in volumes over the past seven days, distancing itself from BNB Chain and Solana. Notable highlights on Ethereum include Uniswap\u2019s $20 billion volume in the period, followed by Balancer\u2019s $9.4 billion and Cowswap\u2019s $900 million. In comparison, BNB Chain\u2019s leading application, PancakeSwap, has gathered $4.2 billion in the same period.\n\nEthereum\u2019s layer-2 scaling solutions have exceeded expectations in terms of activity\n\nWhen accounting for Ethereum layer-2 solutions, the ecosystem surpasses any competitor in terms of active addresses engaging with DApps. Besides the established Polygon network, the privacy-focused zkSync Era has catapulted the aggregate Ethereum rollups\u2019 unique active addresses to 2 million in seven days. The zero-knowledge rollup is expected to launch a token in the near future, creating increased demand for its network use.\n\nRelated: Why is Solana (SOL) price down today?\n\nEther\u2019s price increase has also been boosted by research published by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin on Dec. 28, which proposes a method to reduce the load on validators, theoretically reducing the number of required signatures by 70% and making the process more quantum-resistant. The proposal offers three solutions: decentralized staking pools, a \u201clight\u201d staking method and a rotation between accountable committees.\n\nLastly, Ethereum\u2019s upcoming upgrade, Cancun, is set to undergo testing starting on Jan. 17. It aims to lower transaction fees and introduces new features for bridges and staking pools. Notably, it will include Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844, or \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which will enhance rollup networks\u2019 efficiency by temporarily storing transaction data in a new format called \u201cblobs,\u201d significantly reducing layer-2 transaction fees.\n\nData shows that Ether\u2019s rally has been fueled by increased network and ecosystem use, dominance in terms of DApp deposits, and expectations of further improvements stemming from upgrades. Those changes will likely solidify its leadership in terms of smart contract processing and staking mechanisms.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "After a strong rally, Ethereum (ETH) gains have come to a halt as the crypto extended losses on Friday, December 29, 2023. The bullish run on Thursday propelled the Ethereum price over the $2,445 mark, which was a significant milestone. However, the surge was short-lived as the crypto dropped to about $2,350 at press time.\n\nThe decline could have been initiated due to massive whale transfers as they aim to lock in profits from the recent price rally. In the last 24 hours, whales dumped more than $136 million worth of ETH into various crypto exchanges.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Whale Transfers Exceed $136 million\n\nAccording to recent posts by Whale Alert on X, three major Ethereum whale transactions were recorded after the recent price surge. A total of $136.18 million worth of ETH was dumped by whales. The latest transaction, recorded about four hours ago, involves a shift of 10,000 ETH from an unknown wallet to Gate.io. The transfer amounted to $23.26 million.\n\nWhilst, in another notable transaction, 14,612 ETH worth $34.11 million were dumped to Coinbase via an undisclosed wallet. Furthermore, the largest dump was recorded about 15 hours ago when 33,400 ETH was dumped. This whale transaction, worth $78.81 million, was directed toward Binance from an unidentified wallet.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price: Analyst Predicts 22% Surge In Ethereum (ETH) Price Sparking Market Optimism\n\nEthereum Price Today\n\nThe ETH price tumbled 1.19% as it traded at $2,353.05 at press time on Friday. This comes after it recorded a 30-day high of $2,445.02 on Thursday, December 28. Though the price has been declining currently, the crypto has managed to gain over 3% in the last seven days owing to the recent bullish run.\n\nMoreover, the second largest crypto also registered an impressive 1-month gain of over 14%. According to TradingView analytics, the current price of ETH is trading way higher than the 50-day EMA of 2156.90, indicating a bullish sentiment despite the recent pullback. Whilst, the RSI value stands neutral at 59.5.\n\nAs of writing, the ETH market cap had declined by 1.18% to $282.79 billion. In addition, the 24-hour trade volume plunged significantly. The trade volume dropped by 22.32% to $13.60 billion.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum (ETH) Price Jumps 9% Above $2,400, Beginning of 2024 Bull Run?"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Dencun Upgrade Approaches in January \u2013 Can ETH Reach $4,000?\n\nThe price of Ether (ETH), the cryptocurrency that powers the smart-contract-enabled layer-1 Ethereum blockchain protocol, has been pushing higher amid a favorable macro backdrop and as investors start looking ahead to the major upcoming \u201cDencun\u201d upgrade that will add new data storage capacity to the network.\n\nETH hit new highs for the year on Thursday in the $2,440s before pulling back below $2,400 once again, taking its gains in the past 24 hours to around 3.5%, in the past seven days to over 6.5% and in the last 30 days to over 17%, as per CoinMarketCap.\n\nUS stocks continued pushing higher on Thursday, with the S&P 500 crawling to within 1% of the record highs it printed in early 2022 above 4,800 as US yields and the US Dollar Index (DXY) continue to slide amid bets that the Fed will soon start lowering interest rates.\n\nExpectations of easier financial and liquidity conditions ahead have been a major tailwind for crypto in recent months and look set to offer ETH continued support.\n\nETH volatility could pick up significantly on Friday, a day when a whopping $3.36 billion in ETH options expire as per data presented by The Block, the largest quarterly expiry on record.\n\nBut otherwise, focus is likely to remain on upcoming ETH-relevant themes, such as the positive macro backdrop, the upcoming Dencun upgrade, and growing anticipation that spot Ethereum ETF approvals are coming in 2024.\n\nDencun Upgrade Approaches in January\n\n\n\nEthereum developers are gearing up to implement the so-called \u201cDencun\u201d upgrade that will enable a new blockchain feature called proto-danksharding that is expected to reduce fees for layer-2 scaling protocols and help scale the blockchain by increasing space for data.\n\nAs per a note published on Ethereum\u2019s GitHub repository, the new upgrade will begin testing on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet on the 17th of January, before going live on the Sepolia testnet on the 30th of January and then the Holesky testnet on the 7th of February.\n\nA date for the Dencun upgrade to go live on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet has not yet been announced, but all going well, could presumably be as soon as February.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Can Ether (ETH) Reach $4,000?\n\n\n\nDespite Ether\u2019s year-to-date gains currently sitting in the region of 100%, positive macro, network (i.e. near-term upgrades) and adoption (anticipation for spot Ethereum ETFs) fundamentals suggest risks to the ETH price remain tilted to the upside in the short, medium and longer-term.\n\nTechnicals further add to the bullish picture.\n\nETH has found strong support at the key long-term $2,150 level on multiple occasions in recent weeks whilst also holding to the north of its 21 and 50DMAs, suggestive that the bulls remain in control of the market.\n\nBulls are likely to target a quick move higher towards the key long-term $3,600 area, which marks the April 2022 peak.\n\nThat could mean swift near-term gains of as much as 50% for Ether, taking its recovery back from its 2022 lows to more than 4x.\n\nOnce Ether is able to hit the mid-$3,000s, its assumed that the broader crypto market would be in the throws of a more aggressive bull market and a retest of all-time highs which are close to $5,000 would be increasingly likely.\n\nEther could easily rally above $4,000 in 2024.\n\nETH Alternative to Consider \u2013 Meme Kombat ($MK)\n\n\n\nWhile Ether could offer good upside prospects for the months ahead, traders should always look to diversify their crypto holdings.\n\nFor those with a strong risk tolerance, investing in promising up-and-coming web3 project by buying into their token presales is one good way to generate potential quick exponential gains.\n\nCryptonews.com spends a lot of time analyzing which presales have potential, and one such project that they are big fans of is an exciting new project called Meme Kombat.\n\nMeme Kombat blends together the world of crypto gaming and gambling with its exciting platform where users are able to bet on the outcomes of exciting battles between characters based on some of the crypto world\u2019s most popular meme coins.\n\nEarly $MK investors can also benefit from generous staking rewards, which are currently more than 100% annually.\n\nThe project has already raised close to $5 million, despite launching just weeks ago.\n\nVisit Meme Kombat HereDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin's new proposal would cut Ethereum's security - crypto.news",
        "content": "In a new controversial proposal, Vitalik Buterin suggests decreasing the number of PoS validators from nearly 1 million to just 8,192 to reduce complexity.\n\nIn a new proposal released on Dec. 27, Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a plan to dramatically simplify Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) system to reduce complexity and expand the design possibilities.\n\nThe current PoS system attempts to support decentralization by allowing many validators \u2014 currently almost 900,000. However, Buterin argues that this creates significant complexity, sacrifices, and constraints while still not fully achieving the goal of accessibility for small-scale stakes due to the 32 ETH minimum requirement.\n\nInstead, Buterin proposes reducing the number of signatures per slot to just 8,192 from the current plan of over 1.7 million. This would enable major simplifications across Ethereum, make it much easier to transition to quantum resistance, and retain a cost for attacks between 1-2 million ETH \u2014 which Buterin suggested is high enough:\n\nEven a cost of attack of 1-2 million ETH should be totally sufficient. Vitalik Buterin\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin pitches 3 pathways to simplify Ethereum\u2019s PoS model\n\nDeveloper Micah Zoltu commented on the proposal, noting that this attack cost may be insufficient. According to him, numerous actors dispone this kind of resources and may turn against the protocol sooner or later:\n\nThere are many governments around the world who spend that much on one missile, or one plane. We should be designing systems resilient to state attackers who are willing to spend money to ruin your day. While 1-2 [million] ETH may be enough to deter them from attacking, we have evidence that they will spend far more than this to achieve their goals, and many governments do appear to be heading in the direction of \u201cdestroy crypto\u201d as one of their goals. Of course, I cannot say that 9 [million] ETH is enough either, or maybe both are in fact more than enough! However, I don\u2019t think it is as obvious as you imply that we can safely reduce the security budget. Lindy doesn\u2019t apply to these things, because everything will be fine right up until it isn\u2019t, then it is all very, very bad all of a sudden. Micah Zoltu\n\nThe last part of the statement refers to the Lindy Effect, the theory that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so things that have been around for a long time are more likely to stick around longer.\n\nIn this context, when Zoltu states, \u201cLindy doesn\u2019t apply to these things,\u201d he argues that just because Ethereum\u2019s high level of security has been sufficient so far, it doesn\u2019t mean it will necessarily continue to be sufficient.\n\nButerin outlines three potential approaches to make this reduced signature scheme work: relying entirely on decentralized staking pools, using a two-tiered system with lighter and heavier staking requirements, or rotating participation across slots to retain accountability.\n\nThe proposal has garnered commentary from developers like Zoltu, who questioned whether the reduced 1-2 million ETH attack cost would be sufficient to deter state-level attackers. Buterin acknowledged this was a fair critique, and the optimal cost remains unclear.\n\nThe coming debate around this and other PoS proposals will likely be as vibrant as ever in the Ethereum community.\n\nRead more: Vitalik Buterin unveils major overhaul of Ethereum staking to enhance decentralization\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Solana and Ethereum prices continue to rise while the crypto markets maintain a choppy trend and hover within a narrow range\n\nThe SOL price is gaining more attention compared to the top two cryptos, which may turn against itself soon\n\nThe crypto markets are displaying mixed reactions as a couple of crypto trends continue to remain neutral. Solana rebounded from the lower support, and Ethereum continues to maintain a bullish streak. While the tokens have been displaying some strength, the other cryptos maintain a neutral trend.\n\nSOL and ETH prices have been attracting significant gains in the past few days, despite the bearishness that has managed to hinder the progress of the rally. The recent 1000% jump in SOL price has attracted a massive investor base that has raised volume and volatility to a large extent. Besides, the token also received huge attention as Google searches for Solana overtook Ethereum for the first time in history.\n\nThe rise in interest flashes bullish signals for crypto as it displaces XRP and is constantly challenging BNB in the top 10 market rankings. However, the current market trend suggests the bulls may have been subdued by the whales to some extent. Moreover, massive transactions have created ripples across the platform. According to an analytical platform, an investor deposited 303,756 SOL on Binance, intending to extract profits.\n\nThis may be the reason that the SOL price faced a notable pullback from the yearly highs above $126. Interestingly, the profits extracted from the rally appear to be flowing back to the top 2 tokens, as the liquidity rotation could be happening towards ETH. Therefore, this may be the reason the SOL price is consolidating.\n\nHence, Michael van de Poppe, a well-known crypto analyst, believes the trend may remain in favour of bears, and $70 to $80 could be a good entry for long-term entries."

        "title": "Forget XRP, This Unstoppable Crypto Is Now on Pace to Topple Ethereum and Become the Next Trillion-Dollar Asset - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Make no mistake about it, Solana (SOL -1.46%) is ending the year with a bang. Up more than 900% in 2023, Solana recently passed XRP (XRP 4.62%) to become the fifth-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. Solana now has a $43 billion market cap, and appears to be growing much faster than anyone could have predicted a year ago.\n\nSo just how much higher can Solana go? There's now a case to be made that Solana is on pace to pass Ethereum (ETH 1.60%) to become the second-most valuable cryptocurrency, trailing only Bitcoin (BTC 2.37%). That would represent a huge paradigm shift in the crypto world, given that Ethereum has historically played the role of \"digital silver\" to Bitcoin's \"digital gold.\" Yet there are already signs that this paradigm shift is underway. Let's take a closer look.\n\nNFT evidence\n\nThe first evidence of this potential paradigm shift comes from the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), an area where Ethereum has traditionally dominated. The two most famous NFT collections -- the Bored Ape Yacht Club and the CryptoPunks -- are found on the Ethereum blockchain. Historically, they have been the most popular collections for NFT trading and have been reliable benchmarks for how the overall NFT market is performing.\n\nYet they are no longer the market leaders. The last time I checked, a frog-themed NFT collection for the Solana blockchain had passed the Bored Ape Yacht Club in terms of 24-hour sales volume. And other Solana NFT collections are performing well over longer seven-day and 30-day windows. In fact, according to CryptoSlam data, Solana is nearly tied with Ethereum in terms of 30-day NFT sales volume.\n\nDeFi evidence\n\nMuch the same story is true in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), where Solana appears to be narrowing the gap. This is also an area where Ethereum has historically dominated. But at the end of December, Solana passed Ethereum in terms of DeFi for the first time ever.\n\nOver both a seven-day and 24-hour period, decentralized exchanges on the Solana blockchain saw more trading volume than decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain. This is particularly striking, given that Solana has never made DeFi a core priority. Granted, much of this volume appears to be coming from the buying and selling of Solana meme coins, but it's still interesting to note.\n\nInstitutional buy-in\n\nMoreover, institutional investors appear to be lining up behind Solana as well. According to CoinShares, which tracks institutional money flows out of various cryptos, the pattern throughout 2023 has been the influx of new money into Solana. At the same time, these large institutional investors appear to be scaling back their exposure to Ethereum.\n\nAs a signal of this institutional buy-in, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest recently appeared on CNBC talking up the merits of Solana vis-a-vis Ethereum. Simply stated, Solana is a faster, more cost-effective version of Ethereum, and so it only makes sense that it should be gaining market share in key areas. Shouldn't the best technology win? If that's the case, then the valuation of Solana could soar.\n\nMind the gap\n\nAlthough Solana does appears to be gaining ground on Ethereum, a huge chasm in market cap still separates them. While Solana has a market cap of $43 billion, Ethereum has a market cap of more than $280 billion. For Solana to pass Ethereum in market cap, something extraordinary needs to happen, beyond just the capture of a few points of market share in the world of NFTs or DeFi.\n\nAnd investment firm VanEck seems to have the answer. That \"something extraordinary\" is the launch of a killer app for the Solana blockchain that is capable of onboarding 100 million users. That number might sound preposterous, but keep in mind it only took ChatGPT two months to acquire that many users this year.\n\nIf Solana finds that killer app, says VanEck, its future price could skyrocket by more than 10,000%. Assuming that Solana continues to gain share at the expense of Ethereum in key market niches, VanEck projects that the price of Solana could approach $3,200 by 2030 compared with today's price of about $100.\n\nA $1 trillion valuation for Solana?\n\nIf you multiply that price of $3,200 by Solana's current circulating coin supply of about 429 million, that gives you a figure of $1.4 trillion as a projected market cap. So a valuation of more than $1 trillion is certainly within grasp for Solana. That's the ultimate bull case scenario, of course, but it's still interesting to consider.\n\nIf you are thinking about investing in Solana, keep a close eye on metrics that show that Solana is indeed narrowing the gap with Ethereum. Tracking the sales numbers of digital frogs or digital apes might sound silly, but data like this could signal whether a real paradigm shift is underway. Several years from now, analysts might be talking about Solana as the next trillion-dollar asset."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto YouTuber Lark Davis has taken to the Twitter/X social media network to share his view on the enormous all-time high he expects the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, to reach. He has not named any definitive time frames for this surge, though, and just stated that this is a questions of \u201cwhen, not if\u201d.\n\nDavis bets on Ethereum ultimately reaching a mind-blowing $10,000 price tag. To achieve that price milestone, Ethereum would have to showcase a whopping 321.52% from its current price level - $2,370.\n\nEthereum is going to $10,000, when not if! \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 28, 2023\n\nEthereum reaches new milestones\n\nAs reported by the popular on-chain data aggregator Santiment, Ethereum has been moving towards a new record recently, along with the flagship digital currency Bitcoin. Per recent tweet, Ethereum is now within 1.6% of the highest value since May 11 last year. As for Bitcoin, BTC is within 2.9% of the highest value since April 6 last year. Both highs were reached by these two largest cryptocurrencies at the start of December.\n\nBesides, top 10 exchange wallets continue to move Ethereum, according to an earlier tweet published by Santiment as they are withdrawing their ETH into smaller blockchain addresses from centralized crypto exchanges or are moving Ethereum away from CEXs entirely. About two weeks ago, a massive 240,000 ETH was transferred from exchanges. This massive amount of ETH is evaluated at an impressive $569,347,200 at the time of this writing.\n\nGalaxy Digital dumps tonnes of Ethereum\n\nAs reported by U.Today, approximately a week ago, a major cryptocurrency market player, Galaxy Digital investment fund created and spearheaded by former Goldman Sachs partner Mike Novogratz transferred 11,200 Ethereum to the Binance exchange with an apparent goal to sell it. At that time, this ETH lump was worth roughly $24.3 million.\n\nHowever, it was not the only Ethereum transfer made by Novogratz\u2019s company recently. Blockchain sleuth @OnchainDataNerd stated that until that day, Galaxy Digital had deposited 31,437 ETH in total to various cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nMike Novogratz himself is an early Ethereum investor. In one of his interviews, Novogratz stated that he had bought 500,000 ETH from Vitalik Buterin right after the ICO, before Ether began trading on exchanges and was worth less than $1. He was the first even Wall Street buyer of Ethereum back then."

        "content": "News Direct NYC --News Direct-- Everlodge\n\nThe future for crypto still looks bright. Allied Market Research released a report that the cryptocurrency market value is about to triple by 2030, hitting a whopping $4.94 billion. What's fueling this crypto rocket? According to Allied, it's the focus of cryptocurrency on remittances and global payments taking the lead \u2013 put in one word, utility.\n\nFrom all indications, cryptocurrency is gearing up to be a big player in the future of global finance; but that's 7 years away from now according to the AMR. However, in the near term, investors are eager to know what lies ahead in 2024.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the recently emerged presale utility-focused gem, Everlodge, have all demonstrated the potential for substantial returns. While the reasons behind their promising prospects are quite evident, let\u2019s take a quick dive to see why these projects rank among the best crypto investments to consider ahead of 2024.\n\nGrayscale CEO Optimistic on Bitcoin While Crypto Wizard Target Remains $55,000 for Bitcoin in Q1 2024\n\nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein is seeing big potential for Bitcoin (BTC) once the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gives the thumbs up to a spot market BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nIn a recent CNBC interview, Sonnenshein, though not one to throw around price predictions, emphasizes the prevailing optimism in the market. According to him, a substantial number of investors are jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon and integrating it into their portfolios. As we anticipate the potential approval of the ETF, he believes it will be a game-changer, unlocking opportunities for a significant portion of the investment community.\n\nAs per price predictions, analyst Crypto Wizard posted on X, talking about a potential dip in Bitcoin price below the $40k threshold in the weeks ahead. They note that in the event of any deviation from this prediction, a decisive break above $46k for Bitcoin would be the game-changer. Despite these short-term fluctuations, their overall target stands firm at $55k for Bitcoin price by the first quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum Looks Bullish for 2024\n\nThe immense popularity of the Ethereum (ETH) network has positioned it among the leading altcoins in today's market. Its widespread appeal is not the only factor contributing to its positive sentiment; Ethereum also benefits from a history of resilience and market dominance.\n\nWith a current price of $2,230, Ethereum has experienced significant growth in the past month, reaching a peak of around $2,367 to mark the highest point of the year. While the overall bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market may be waning, Ethereum price has managed to remain relatively stable, with a nearly 2% increase over the past week.\n\nHowever, considering the recent drop of over $100 from its peak, investors should be prepared for a potential further correction. Yet, given Ethereum's historical price resilience and strong market presence, it is reasonable to expect a more stable price trajectory leading up to the new year.\n\nEverlodge Has Lofty Plans To Take Charge in Q1 2024\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) emerged as a revolutionary force in the real estate realm, positioned to revolutionize the $280 trillion industry by tackling long-standing challenges. Traditionally, the prohibitively high entry costs, often reaching millions of dollars, combined with a lack of transparency and liquidity, have created barriers for numerous potential investors.\n\nEverlodge's DeFi property marketplace directly confronts these challenges within the travel property sector. Through the innovative approach of listing properties as NFTs on its platform, Everlodge introduces fractionalized ownership, allowing investors to purchase NFT fractions representing a percentage of a property. Imagine owning 25% of a property generating $6,000 monthly, resulting in a $1,500 passive income.\n\nIn essence, Everlodge not only breaks down barriers but also provides investors with the opportunity to access equity in some of the world's most luxurious travel properties and you can join in for only $0.027.\n\nFurthermore, industry experts predict a potential 10X surge in Everlodge's project valuation if the company successfully achieves crucial milestones. This projection highlights the anticipation surrounding Everlodge's transformative initiatives and underscores the potential for significant growth, positioning it as one of the best crypto investments leading up to 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, the probability of a positive upturn in cryptocurrency in 2024 is very much palpable and projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Everlodge have everything to fight for to become the best coins to invest in 2024.\n\nFor more information about the ongoing Everlodge (ELDG) Presale, please visit their website.\n\nEverlodge provides you with a seamless approach to fractional investing in vacation rentals, eliminating the complexities associated with traditional real estate investment.

        "content": "The Ethereum network is poised for significant growth in 2024, thanks to the Dencun Upgrade, which aims to enhance network efficiency, scalability, and decrease transaction costs.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, it stands on the cusp of significant growth in 2024. Analysts, including CryptosRUs Analysis , are bullish about Ethereum's future, particularly due to the anticipated Dencun Upgrade. This upgrade is expected to be a game-changer for Ethereum's ecosystem, driving exponential growth through various technical enhancements.\n\nDetails of the Dencun Upgrade\n\nScheduled for early 2024, the Dencun Upgrade represents a pivotal step in Ethereum's development. Initially planned for late 2023, its launch was shifted to 2024 to address complex engineering aspects. The upgrade is set to undergo its first testnet deployment in January, starting with the Goerli test network. This marks a move towards improving layer 2 rollup efficiency and expanding blockchain scalability.\n\nThe Dencun Upgrade focuses on increasing data storage capacity through \"proto-danksharding,\" a process that is key to Ethereum's long-term scalability plans. This upgrade will also enhance the performance of bridges and staking protocols, reduce transaction fees , and limit the use of self-destruct operations on smart contracts.\n\nDuring recent tests, Ethereum demonstrated a 99% participation rate in adopting the changes introduced by the upgrade, and 95% of data \"blobs\" propagated in less than 2 seconds. These technical achievements underline the potential efficiency gains from the Dencun Upgrade.\n\nImpact on Ethereum\u2019s Ecosystem\n\nThe Dencun Upgrade is expected to have a transformative effect on Ethereum's ecosystem. It will increase data availability for layer-2 rollups via proto-danksharding, leading to reduced transaction costs for users. This will optimize gas fees and improve network security, making Ethereum a more scalable and efficient blockchain.\n\nGoldman Sachs notes that Dencun's primary impact will be on enhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability through rollups and setting the stage for future scalability upgrades, including danksharding. This positions Ethereum as a more capable and versatile platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nMarket Outlook and Predictions\n\nAnalysts, including those from CryptosRUs Analysis, forecast a bullish trend for Ethereum in 2024. This optimism is rooted in fundamental factors and technical indicators. The Dencun Upgrade, coupled with the potential approval of a spot ETF for Ethereum, is expected to catalyze significant market growth. CryptosRUs Analysis compares Ethereum\u2019s prospective trajectory with Solana\u2019s recent price action, suggesting a possible bull flag pattern for Ethereum leading into the upgrade.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, is trading at $2,315.75, with a recent 4.15% increase. This price movement, along with the high network activity and growth in NFT trades on Ethereum, indicates strong market interest and potential for further appreciation.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "The Debate of ETH vs. SOL and the Overlooked Layer 2 Conversation\n\nIn the bustling realm of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), the debate between Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) often garners significant attention. However, an equally pivotal discussion lies in the evolution of Ethereum\u2019s network, particularly its expansion from Layer 1 (L1) to a diverse ecosystem of Layer 2 (L2) solutions. This shift addresses two primary criticisms of Ethereum\u2019s L1: high gas fees and slower transaction speeds.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Layer 1: The Foundation of Trust and Security\n\nEthereum\u2019s L1 is often criticized for its high gas fees and relatively slower transaction speed. However, it\u2019s crucial to understand that Ethereum\u2019s L1 serves a specific purpose. It acts as a settlement layer, ensuring the highest level of trust and security for large-scale transactions, not typically intended for everyday retail use.\n\nThe Emergence of Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2: A Spectrum of Affordable and Fast Solutions\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum has led to the emergence of various L2 solutions, each offering lower costs and higher transaction speeds. These include:\n\nOptimism and Arbitrum: Focused on scaling Ethereum while ensuring security.\n\nFocused on scaling Ethereum while ensuring security. Polygon: Known for its versatility and wide adoption.\n\nKnown for its versatility and wide adoption. Base, zkSync, and ImmutableX: Offering innovative approaches to scaling and cost reduction, with ImmutableX achieving literally zero gas fees.\n\nOffering innovative approaches to scaling and cost reduction, with ImmutableX achieving literally zero gas fees. Linea and Scroll: New entrants providing additional options for users seeking efficiency.\n\nAll these L2 solutions utilize ETH for gas and settle on Ethereum\u2019s L1, contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem by burning ETH and generating revenue.\n\nThe Misconception of Ethereum\u2019s Inefficiency\n\nIt\u2019s a misconception to claim Ethereum as a whole is plagued by high gas costs and slow speeds. The high-cost, slower L1 is designed for specific use cases, while retail activity increasingly moves to the more efficient L2s, especially during the bear market.\n\nSecurity, Decentralization, and Specialization: The L2 Advantage\n\nL2s are not just about lower fees and faster transactions. They experiment with various levels of security, decentralization, and specialization, adding richness to the Ethereum network. This experimentation includes the development of new technologies like the SVM, MOVE, and fully private chains.\n\nInteroperability: The Bridge to a Unified Network\n\nCritics often point to the poor user experience of bridging between networks and the fracturing of liquidity. However, advancements in interoperability, like Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), intentions-based bridges, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), are paving the way for seamless integration between these networks. This integration hints at a future where specialized chains operate harmoniously, enhancing the user experience.\n\nConclusion: Ethereum\u2019s Transformation into a Network of Networks\n\nEthereum\u2019s evolution into a network of networks, rather than a single shared state, aligns with the broader vision of a modular, interconnected blockchain ecosystem. This development not only addresses the limitations of its L1 but also opens up a world of possibilities for users and developers alike.\n\nTL;DR: Ethereum\u2019s expansion from Layer 1 to a diverse Layer 2 ecosystem addresses its high gas fees and slower speeds, offering a range of solutions with varying costs, speeds, and features. This evolution transforms Ethereum into a flexible, secure, and interconnected network, paving the way for a more efficient and user-friendly blockchain experience."

        "content": "Data shows Ethereum was the most exploited DeFi chain in 2023 by the amount lost.\n\nBNB Chain was also heavily exploited by hackers this year.\n\nPrior year data shows that BNB Chain suffered the biggest dollar losses.\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) has changed the game by opening access to financial services without an intermediary. However, a recent tweet from Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp stated that $1.95 billion was lost to DeFi exploits in 2023, down slightly from 2022, which put total DeFi losses for that year at $2.075 billion, according to security firm SlowMist.\n\nDeFi protocols are vulnerable to loss due to the open and immutable nature of the smart contracts that underpin DeFi. However, different protocols seem more susceptible to attack than others, as evidenced by 70% of 2023\u2019s DeFi losses occurring on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nCybercriminals Favor Ethereum\n\nAccording to Lopp\u2019s uncited data source, 2023 DeFi losses occurred mostly on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchains, totaling $1.35 billion and $110.1 million, respectively.\n\nAlthough the biggest total dollar loss was attributed to Ethereum, which accounted for nearly 70% of the $1.95 billion total loss in 2023, the highest number of incidents occurred on BSC at 213. This indicates attackers exploit BSC more frequently but can extract less money on average than the DeFi market leader.\n\nEthereum and Binance Smart Chain experienced the most DeFi security incidents by far in 2023. pic.twitter.com/ZS9ZqNKBww \u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) December 28, 2023\n\nAccording to DeFiLlama, 2023\u2019s biggest single DeFi hack was a database attack on Mixin, netting hackers $200 million in September. The Mixin Network is a trading network that connects different blockchains to its own multi-chain network. It was noted that Mixin was not mentioned in Lopp\u2019s data source.\n\nWhile 2023 was damaging to Ethereum\u2019s reputation, BSC DeFi protocols were heavily targeted by hackers in 2022.\n\n2022 DeFi Hacks\n\nData on DeFi hacks compiled by SlowMist showed 183 security incidents last year, totaling a loss of $2.075 billion. Unlike the current year, BNB Chain held the highest number of breaches at 79 and the biggest loss of any chain at $785 million.\n\nDeFi security incidents by chain per SlowMist.\n\nBinance rebranded Binance Smart Chain to BNB Chain in February 2022, but many still interchange the two names.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nLopp did not attribute the 2023 DeFi hack data source, making it difficult to review the methodology.\n\nDifferent sources may use varying standards and criteria to calculate data on DeFi loss es .\n\nEthereum\u2019s 2023 $1.35 billion DeFi loss represents around 4.6% of the blockchain\u2019s current value locked in ETH DeFi protocols.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nAlthough the majority of DeFi losses in 2023 occurred on Ethereum, the issue of DeFi security spans the entire crypto industry. Failure to address the issue jeopardizes future growth until trust can be established through better practices such as stricter oversight and improved code auditing.\n\nRead about Arthur Hayes\u2019 recent Ethereum price prediction here:\n\nHayes Ditches Solana for Ethereum, Citing $5K \u201cProphecy\u201d\n\n\n\nFind out more on the evidence that supports Craig Wright\u2019s Satoshi claim here:\n\nBitcoin SV Pumps as Wright Boosts Satoshi Legitimacy Claims"

        "content": "Solana recently achieved a significant milestone by overtaking Ethereum in Google search interest for the first time. According to Google Trends data from December 17\u201323, global Solana searches eclipsed those for Ethereum, with a peak score of 56 versus 50.\n\nIn certain countries, like Spain and the Philippines, Solana commanded substantially higher relative search volumes than Ethereum. Meanwhile, Ethereum still leads Solana in Indonesia, Taiwan, Morocco, and other regions.\n\nSource: Google Trends\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu: What Will You Do If SHIB Reaches $0.01?\n\nSolana is gaining worldwide attention\n\nNonetheless, Solana\u2019s ascendance in search dominance underscores its increasing mainstream traction. Much of the attention likely stems from the success of meme coins built on the network.\n\nGoogle Trends revealed surging user interest in Solana-based projects like Bonk. Bonk, a dog-themed meme token, shocked markets after flipping Dogecoin rival Pepe for a short period in terms of market capitalization.\n\nAlso read: How High Can Binance Coin (BNB) Surge in January 2024?\n\nSolana\u2019s native SOL token also breached new milestones, likely fueling additional searches. SOL briefly flipped XRP as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in late December based on market capitalization. It also dethroned BNB as the fourth-largest coin for a short period of time.\n\nFor now, SOL appears to be riding the wave of market exuberance, even as analysts question its sustainability beyond near-term trends. However, if the network can channel short-term hype into long-term adoption, SOL may establish itself as a lasting alternative to Ethereum."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSolana (SOL) has seen a significant increase in its value throughout 2023, with notable growth, especially in mid-December.\n\nGoogle search interest in Solana has recently exceeded that for Ethereum, with particular popularity in countries like Spain and the Philippines.\n\nAlong with its rise in search popularity, Solana has also seen a surge in trading volume and has outperformed Ethereum in certain other metrics.\n\nSolana Takes the Lead\n\nSolana\u2019s price has exploded by 1,000% since January 1, hovering around $107 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data) as of the moment. The token saw its value gradually increasing throughout the year, with the most rapid pace occurring in mid-December.\n\nThis could be one reason why Solana searches on Google have surpassed those for Ethereum since then. The former currently has an index of 56, while its rival is with 51. Google searches are usually a trailing indicator, which tends to increase after the price goes up.\n\nSolana has gained the most popularity in Spain and the Philippines. In contrast, the residents of Brazil, Poland, and Finland remain much more interested in Ethereum.\n\nGoogle\u2019s data shows that people from the countries searching for Solana have also shown significant interest in Bonk Inu (BONK) \u2013 a memecoin built on the network. The dog-themed crypto asset made the headlines earlier this month when its price reached an all-time high (ATH), whereas its market capitalization surged above the $2 billion mark.\n\nIt\u2019s Not Just Google Searches\n\nBesides becoming more popular on Google, Solana has succeeded in a few other fields. On-chain trading volume jumped to a peak of over $2.6 billion on December 22, staying above the $1.2 billion level until December 27, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s.\n\n\n\nIn the past few days, however, ETH reclaimed its lead, registering a trading volume of more than $2 billion on December 28 versus $1.1 billion for Solana.\n\nThe non-fungible token niche also witnessed some shifts. Solana NFT sales volume hit almost $75 million in the last week, outpacing Ethereum, which comprised approximately $72 million."

        "content": "The leading smart contract platform by volume is seeing a rise in price after its co-founder shared a proposal to simplify its proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.\n\nIn a new thread, Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin releases his proposal on how to improve the top altcoin\u2019s blockchain, saying that it would make the proof-of-stake system \u201cconsiderably simpler and lighter.\u201d\n\nIn the proposal, Buterin says that the upgrade would boost decentralization and allow regular individuals to partake in staking. However, he notes that the proposal comes at a high cost.\n\n\u201cThis approach requires the Ethereum chain to process a huge number of signatures (~28,000 today; 1,790,000 post-SSF [single slot finality]) per slot, which is a very high load. Supporting this load entails a lot of technical sacrifices.\u201d\n\nAccording to Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s centralization works against it because if it were to suffer an attack, it would cost the network about 9 million tokens, or $20 billion.\n\n\u201cIf a 51% attack takes place [on Ethereum], a large fraction of the entire attacking validator set has their deposits slashed. The cost of an attack is at present around 9 million ETH (~$20 billion), and that assumes network synchrony breaks in a way that maximally favors the attacker. I argue that this is a high cost, but it is too high a cost, and we can afford to make some sacrifices in the matter\u2026\n\nThis is why I advocate a moderate solution: one that makes some sacrifices on validator accountability, but still keeps the amount of total slashable ETH quite high, but in exchange gets us most of the benefits of a smaller validator set.\u201d\n\nButerin concludes that the optimal number of signatures to process per slot for ETH is 8192 as it would make it \u201cmuch easier for anyone to run a consensus client, and users, staking enthusiasts and others would be able to immediately work off of that assumption.\u201d\n\nAfter the announcement, the price of Ethereum jumped to $2,442. However, it has since stabilized and is trading for $2,370 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nAs the calendar year draws to a close, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are preparing for a significant event: the largest options expiry in its history, valued over $11 billion. However, contrary to what many might expect, tomorrow\u2019s expiry seems to have minimal impact on the market.\n\nBitcoin Is Far From The Max Pain Point (MPP)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s bulls are happy as BTC\u2019s surge is going to favor their positions during tomorrow\u2019s option expiry. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to show robust support, maintaining a position above $40,000 as we near the end of 2023\u2019s final quarterly options expiry.\n\nThis Friday at 08:00 UTC, $7.7 billion in BTC options, along with $3.5 billion in ETH options, are set to expire on the Deribit crypto exchange.\n\nThe sum exceeding $11 billion sets a new record for Deribit, being the most substantial expiry to date. Notably, nearly $5 billion of these options are poised to expire profitably \u2014 the highest figure to date \u2014 which could trigger increased levels of hedging and trading activities than usual.\n\nFor Bitcoin, the put/call ratio is at 0.67, favoring bullish positions with call options standing at 106K. The notional value is $7.586 billion with the max pain point at $33,000.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s MPP indicates where option buyers may face maximum losses at expiry. Options sellers often try to push Bitcoin\u2019s price towards this point. However, it is believed that with the current MPP for BTC being far from its present price, there\u2019s little likelihood of significant movement towards this point ahead of Friday\u2019s expiry.\n\nTo minimize losses before the expiry, bears need to push the price down to $41,900. On the other hand, bulls aim for a rise above $44,000 to gain a $1.2 billion lead. This potential profit for call option holders might bring further price increases ahead of the ETF decision.\n\nEthereum\u2019s $2,300 Trade Brings Confidence\n\nThis quarter witnessed a remarkable increase in crypto values, with Bitcoin soaring by 62% and Ethereum by 45%. This uptick has lured investors to chase higher gains through call options, leading to a high level of open interest with massive in-the-money (ITM) call options.\n\nExamining Ethereum\u2019s options data reveals that bulls have made big profits from their call options, especially as Ethereum\u2019s price recently surpassed $2,300. Ethereum\u2019s Max Pain Point (MPP) stands at $1,900, where the largest concentration of call options, worth a notional $259 million, are currently in the money (ITM). The put-call ratio stands at 0.51, indicating a strong preference for call options.\n\nGiven that Ethereum\u2019s price is significantly above its MPP of $1,900, it\u2019s unlikely to experience bearish volatility, maintaining a bullish sentiment in the market. However, to reduce losses, bears would aim to plunge Ethereum\u2019s price below $2,200.\n\nConversely, with the second-highest concentration of call options at $2,500, valued at $238 million, bulls would benefit from pushing Ethereum\u2019s price above $2,500 by 8 am ET on December 29th."

After a period of underperformance that saw its price and comparative value to Bitcoin decline, Ethereum is showing signs of a bullish resurgence, regaining its footing in the crypto market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recent downtrend in ETHUSD had led many investors to consider Ethereum an underbought asset, slapping the label \"beta play\" on it, suggesting it was a less volatile, less rewarding investment compared to its peers. This perception is now being challenged as Ethereum demonstrates strength and growth potential, with its price incrementally rising against both USD and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile Ethereum gains momentum, its competitor, Solana, is observed to be relinquishing much of its previously accumulated value, highlighting the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets.\n\nThe shifting focus towards Ethereum may be partly attributed to the increasing interest in Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. These platforms promise to address Ethereum's scalability and high transaction fee issues, which have been significant concerns for users and developers.\n\nAs the Ethereum network continues to be the primary choice for decentralized applications, the enhancement of its scalability and efficiency through Layer 2 solutions could significantly support its attractiveness and utility, driving further adoption and investment.\n\nLayer 2 solutions have become increasingly critical as they allow Ethereum to scale effectively by handling transactions off the main chain (Layer 1), thus alleviating congestion and reducing fees. The successful implementation and adoption of these solutions are crucial for Ethereum's long-term viability as a smart contract platform, especially as it faces stiff competition from rivals that offer cheaper user experience.\n\nAs Ethereum's price shows a positive trajectory, there is a cautious optimism among investors that this could be the beginning of a bullish trend. However, the overall market sentiment remains subject to various external factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the blockchain space.\n\nSolana slows down\n\nSolana has been emerging as a notable contender among the array of digital assets. However, recent trends indicate a cooling phase for the asset, particularly in the context of its pricing dynamics and ecosystem growth.\n\nVenture Capitals (VCs), renowned for their strategic investments and market influence, have played a pivotal role in the pricing volatility observed in Solana. Initially, VCs were significant proponents of the Solana ecosystem, recognizing its potential for high throughput and efficient transaction capabilities. This support resulted in a substantial influx of capital which, combined with speculative interest from retail investors, propelled Solana to new heights.\n\nHowever, the very nature of venture capital investments involves calculated entry and exit strategies. As Solana's prices soared, VCs began to capitalize on their investments, introducing considerable selling pressure in the market. This is not a development unique to Solana; it's a prevalent cycle seen across various cryptocurrency platforms where after substantial appreciation, investors seek to realize profits.\n\nRetail investors, on the other hand, often find themselves riding the wave of enthusiasm. The proliferation of memecoins within the Solana ecosystem, which delivered exponential returns in a short span, is a testament to this fervor. However, the staggering returns were also accompanied by heightened risks, including projects with inadequate security measures, leading to 'rug pulls' and market manipulations.\n\nAs the market begins to assimilate these risks, a natural retreat occurs. Retail investors, learning from the market's punitive lessons, start to engage in profit-taking. This behavior is partly defensive, a safeguard against the anticipated surge in selling pressure from VCs and a measure to secure gains from the speculative frenzy that had become all too common.\n\nMoreover, the cooling off of Solana's ecosystem is reflected in its capitalization metrics. The excessive heat, characterized by the meteoric rise of memecoins and the influx of speculative capital, has diminished. The market has started to recalibrate, aligning more closely with fundamental valuations rather than the speculative momentum that previously drove demand."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has given investors reasons to be positive about the upcoming year by reaching a 52-week high of $2,430. This latest surge comes on the heels of a volatile year for the second-largest cryptocurrency, which was not free from the effects of this year\u2019s economic uncertainty.\n\nIt was back in April of 2023 when Ethereum first surpassed the $2,000 resistance point before dropping in value again. While the price has increased by around 20% since then, ETH\u2019s value is still considerably lower than its all-time high of $4,878 two years ago.\n\nCrypto prices are higher across the board \u2013 and it looks like this rally could go much higher.\n\nWhat Is Driving Up Ethereum\u2019s Price?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price surge above $2,400 is directly linked to growing on-chain activity and recent regulatory activity. The network\u2019s daily transaction volume recently hit $3.92 billion, the highest since March of this year and more than 3 times that of October.\n\nThis activity is a direct result of Ethereum\u2019s solidified position across the DeFi, NFT, and gaming sectors, which keeps it a popular choice for developers creating their projects. At the same time, BlackRock\u2019s moves toward launching an Ethereum ETF have also fueled bullish speculation that directly translates to the adoption of the network.\n\nWith regulators continuing to take action against crypto\u2019s bad actors, institutional trust has also continued to increase over the past year. The fall of Sam Bankman-Fried, \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, and Alex Mashinsky were all well-received by lawmakers, investors, and major players in the industry. One example is Kraken\u2019s Co-Founder Jesse Powell\u2019s assertion that they could bring a \u201cmore fair\u201d ecosystem and clear the industry\u2019s reputation.\n\nWhat Will 2024 Bring for Ethereum?\n\nWith blockchain adoption and regulatory enforcement being likely to continue over the next year, investors believe the currency uptrend will continue in the new year. Crypto Youtuber Lark Davis, for example, took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to state his belief that Ethereum\u2019s rise to $10,000 was only a matter of time.\n\nEthereum is going to $10,000, when not if! \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 28, 2023\n\nDavis predicts that recently launched layer-2 protocols on Ethereum could spur short-term pumps that will maintain the uptrend. Such a move would also mean that if Ethereum were to replicate previous bull cycles, a price as high as $15,000 could be easily attainable.\n\nWith the launch of Ethereum\u2019s Dencun Testnet also set to be launched in 2024, the technical capabilities of the network will be significantly increased. This would put Ethereum on a direct collision course with so-called \u201cEthereum killers\u201d like Avalanche and Solana, both of which had experienced rapid growth thanks to their superior performance and scalability.\n\nCan Solana Truly Kill Ethereum?\n\nSolana\u2019s stunning resurgence poses a renewed threat to Ethereum\u2019s dominance of DeFi, Blockchain gaming, and decentralized applications. The network\u2019s high-speed architecture has powered trading volumes rivaling Ethereum\u2019s top DEX Uniswap, making it increasingly attractive to developers. This resulted in a surge in price of over 900% for the Ethereum killer in only one year, a performance no other top project could match.\n\nAnalysts have similarly found that while Solana was able to double its value in December alone, it has been outperformed by projects like Injective and NEAR. This trend suggests that Solana\u2019s surge might be primarily driven by Ethereum\u2019s high gas prices and the virality of its meme coins more than anything else.\n\nWith $1.5 billion total value locked, however, Solana still pales against Ethereum\u2019s $29 billion ecosystem. While the hype of the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d narrative has served server networks like Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano well over the years, it hasn\u2019t been enough. Rather than a true usurper yet, Solana seems to be benefiting from a renewed hype cycle that still needs to translate to increased adoption.\n\nRegardless, most tokens will move higher next year, the only question is by how much."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: For nearly a month, the Ethereum(ETH) has been trading sideways resonating within two horizontal levels of $2400 and $2137. On December 28th, the daily chart showed a long-wick rejection candle at this overhead resistance reflecting the presence of high supply pressure. This selling pressure aligned with current market uncertainty hints at a possibility of potential correction as ETH may develop a double-top pattern.\n\nAlso Read: Vitalik Buterin Proposes Solutions for Ethereum PoS Complexity\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs ETH Price Heading Back to the $1850 Mark?\n\nA Double Top pattern puts ETH price at 20% downside risk\n\nA lower high formation in the daily RSI slope reflects weakening bullish momentum.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $12.3 Billion, indicating a 23% loss.\n\nIn the last three weeks, the Ethereum price has shown two reversals from the $2400 resistance level, reflecting that the sellers are aggressively defending this level. A look at the daily time frame chart has shown this rejection as the formation of a bearish reversal pattern called \u2018double top\u2019.\n\nIn the last 48 hours, the ETH price has plunged 3.55% currently trading at $2303. With sustained selling, the coin price will attempt a break below the ascending trendline which has acted as a dynamic support for the past two months.\n\nThis breakdown would accelerate the supple pressure and bolster sellers to challenge the neckline resistance of $2135. Should the Ethereum coin break below this level, the sellers may prolong the correction another 13.5% to hit the $1850 mark.\n\nCrypto Analyst Hints A Rally to $3593\n\nWhile the current market correction and bearish pattern formation give a bearish outlook to the Ethereum price, the coin buyers can get an opportunity to counterattack at $2135. This neckline support aligned close with the 50-day EMA slope creates a strong demand area.\n\nIn addition, a renowned crypto analyst JacobCanfield added in his recent X-platform post that the ETH price has successfully retested this Weekly support($2124), suggesting it could act as a suitable launchpad to trigger a rally to $3583.\n\nThus, if the coin price shows suitability or buyers accumulation at the $2135-$2124 region, the aforementioned bearish thesis will be invalidated.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): A bearish divergence in the daily RSI slope increasing the possibility for a price correction.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The rising daily EMAs (20, 50, 100, and 200) hint the overall trend remains bullish.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "title": "Vitalik Proposes 3 Paths to Enhance ETH Network Efficiency - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has unveiled radical solutions to transform the ETH network.\n\nThe proposed changes have aimed to simplify Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism while enhancing security.\n\nThe proposed overhaul has promised improved accessibility for new users.\n\nTo address the complexity and scalability limitations of Ethereum\u2019s current signature method, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined three alternative approaches that aim to enhance the overall efficiency and user experience of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nButerin\u2019s Proposed Solutions to Ethereum\u2019s Scalability Issues\n\nApproach 1: Go All-in on Decentralized Staking Pools\n\nFirstly, Buterin proposed a significant reduction in the number of validators by setting a minimum deposit requirement of 4096 ETH and a maximum cap of 4096 validators. This would significantly lower the computational burden on the network and simplify the consensus mechanism.\n\nApproach 2: Two-Tiered Staking\n\nAlternatively, Buterin suggested implementing a two-tier staking system, where validators would be divided into the \u2018heavy\u2019 layer and the \u2018light\u2019 layer. The heavy layer would be composed of validators with a 4096 ETH minimum deposit, responsible for core consensus mechanisms.\n\nThe light layer would include validators with no minimum deposit, contributing to overall network security without the same level of direct involvement in consensus.\n\nApproach 3: Rotating Participation (i.e., Committees but Accountable)\n\nFinally, Buterin proposed a rotating participation approach, where a subset of 4096 validators would be randomly selected for each slot to participate in consensus. This would ensure a diverse and dynamic validator set while maintaining efficiency and scalability.\n\nButerin Proposes Significant Network Overhaul\n\nButerin argues that the rotating participation approach is the best way to balance the need for accountability with the need for decentralization. It would allow for a more decentralized staking system without sacrificing security.\n\nHe also argues that the overall security of the Ethereum network would be improved by reducing the number of signatures per slot. This would make it less expensive to attack the network and make it more difficult for attackers to succeed.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal is a significant departure from the current design of the Ethereum network. It would require a major overhaul of the consensus protocol and likely face resistance from some stakeholders.\n\nHowever, Buterin argues that the benefits of his proposal are too great to ignore. He believes it would make the Ethereum network more secure, decentralized, and accessible to new users.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nReducing the number of validators drastically to 4096 could potentially cause a concentration of power among a smaller group.\n\nWhile the proposed aims are noble, the practicality and successful execution of them remain uncertain and could face substantial hurdles.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe proposed changes outlined by Vitalik Buterin could revolutionize Ethereum\u2019s structure. With Ethereum holding a prominent position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, these alterations may redefine the Ethereum network itself and potentially reshape the broader landscape of the crypto industry.\n\nTo learn more about former President Trump\u2019s sale of $2.5M worth of ETH following disappointing Mugshot NFT sales, read here:\n\nTrump Sells $2.5M ETH Upon Disappointing Mugshot NFT Sales\n\n\n\nTo explore further how Ethereum exploits contribute to 70% of all DeFi losses in 2023, read here:\n\nEthereum Exploits Account for 70% of all DeFi Losses in 2023"

        "content": "Ethereum needs to reignite the \u201ccypherpunk\u201d revolution that was first envisioned for the blockchain in its early days, says Vitalik Buterin, one of the network\u2019s founders.\n\nAccording to a Dec. 28 blog post from Buterin, Ethereum was initially envisioned as a \u201cpublic decentralized shared hard drive\u201d that could leverage peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage, but the vision began to fade in 2017 with the turn toward financialization on Ethereum.\n\nDecentralization, open participation, censorship resistance and credible neutrality are among the \u201ccypherpunk\u201d values Buterin wants to see firmly return to Ethereum\u2019s future, and he remains hopeful that non-financial applications can flourish on the blockchain.\n\nHe highlighted that rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction and second-generation privacy solutions have become more mainstream, which could uphold some of these cypherpunk values.\n\nCypherpunk refers to a person who uses encryption to ensure privacy when accessing a computer network, especially from government authorities.\n\nThis is Ethereum\n\n\n\nThis is why we are here pic.twitter.com/onMU20q9w2 \u2014 sassal.eth/acc (@sassal0x) December 29, 2023\n\nParticipating in polls without revealing one\u2019s privacy and implementing mechanisms such as quadratic voting and cross-tribal consensus finding to help organizations govern themselves are among the other cypherpunk-like activities that Buterin wants to see more of on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the stack is to enable this pluralism, but that the same time strive for growing interoperability across this plurality.\u201d https://t.co/ExE0ILc2Vl pic.twitter.com/2IXkHMf5b7 \u2014 dr3a.eth (@dr3a_eth) December 28, 2023\n\n\u201cIt is very possible to build things within the crypto ecosystem that do not follow these values,\u201d Buterin conceded, hinting at certain examples.\n\nFor example, building a highly centralized layer secured by multisignature with no plans to change or a nonfungible token ecosystem where the NFTs are stored on a centralized website instead of a decentralized file storage platform like IPFS.\n\n\u201cOne could build a staking interface that needlessly funnels users toward the already-largest staking pool,\u201d Buterin added:\n\n\u201cResisting these pressures is hard, but if we do not do so, then we risk losing the unique value of the crypto ecosystem, and recreating a clone of the existing web2 ecosystem with extra inefficiencies and extra steps.\u201d\n\nThat said, Buterin said he\u2019s been impressed with solutions that have come about from some of the industry\u2019s biggest problems.\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin warns against overloading Ethereum consensus layer\n\nHe noted that decentralized exchanges have provided a solution to hacks on centralized exchanges, while Cowswap, Flashbots Protect and MEV Blocker have helped limit the severity of sandwich attacks on Ethereum users by maximum extractable value exploiters.\n\nVarious problems and solutions have been addressed in the Ethereum ecosystem. Source: Vitalik.eth\n\nOn Dec. 28, Buterin proposed to make the Ethereum proof-of-stake chain lighter and simpler by reducing the number of signatures that validators are required to make to keep the network running.\n\nMagazine: 'Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

In the past three weeks, data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence shows that the wallet transferred 1,075 ETH to Coinbase.\n\nIf the transferred amount was likely sold for USD as assumed, then the wallet may have realized around $2.4 million. Nevertheless, a less likely outcome is that the large volume of ETH may have been moved to Coinbase to maximize staking yield.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump-associated address still holds around 589.5 ETH (worth approximately $1.4 million) and 273.7 Wrapped Ether (ETH) valued at roughly $650,000). The ETH position represents the majority of the wallet\u2019s holdings.\n\nAt its most recent peak value in early December, the wallet held around $4 million in crypto assets. However, the recent transfers to Coinbase mean the address now holds just $2.2 million worth of cryptocurrencies.\n\nDonald Trump and Crypto\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump was a vocal crypto critic during his time in office. However, following his replacement in early 2021, the former president appears to have a changed stance. Donald Trump has a team set up to monetize his enigmatic character and history through the sale of NFTs.\n\nThe Trump NFT team evidently controls the blockchain address now tied to the former U.S. President. A significant portion of the ETH recently transferred to Coinbase represents royalties realized from holders trading Trump NFTs, hence the suggestion the Trump team may have liquidated the assets.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump is still in the race to become U.S. President at the 2024 polls. If the former President realizes his ambitions, the United States might usher in its first national leader with direct ties to the crypto and NFT space."

Discover SCENE\n\nBlast, an upcoming Ethereum layer-2 scaling network from the creator of leading NFT marketplace Blur, has now pulled in more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of deposits from users vying to earn yield and points towards an upcoming token airdrop.\n\nSome $1.13 billion worth of cryptocurrency has been deposited into the Blast bridge as of this writing, according to both the official website and DeFiLlama, making it the 23rd largest protocol by total value locked according to the latter resource. Over 86,000 users have contributed funds thus far.\n\nAccording to Blast, users are earning about a 4% annual return on deposited Ethereum (ETH) and 5% on stablecoins. Furthermore, they\u2019re earning \u201cBlast Points,\u201d which will play into their respective share of the upcoming BLAST token airdrop.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the Blast website, the airdrop is set for May 2024.\n\nBlast aims to make an impact in the crowded Ethereum scaling market\u2014which includes networks like Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base\u2014by incentivizing users with both native yield on staked cryptocurrency along with a share of tokens via airdrops. Crypto protocols use airdrops to give out tokens to early users and contributors, typically aiding in decentralized governance as well.\n\nPulling in users with the allure of token rewards is the same strategy that worked wonders for Blur, which dethroned one-time leader OpenSea to become the leading NFT marketplace in February. Blur has airdropped more than $800 million worth of BLUR tokens to NFT traders in 2023 across two waves, based on the peak value of the token, per data from CoinGecko.\n\nBoth Blast and Blur were founded by Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre, and both were backed by prominent crypto venture capital firm Paradigm. However, Blast\u2019s rollout has been controversial\u2014even for its backers.\n\nUsers are depositing cryptocurrency into a bridge that does not currently connect to the actual Blast network that\u2019s in development, and funds cannot be withdrawn until February 2024. The overt emphasis on earning yield and rewards before the network is even live has apparently rubbed some crypto users the wrong way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn late November, just days after Blast was revealed to the world, Paradigm Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson wrote that the firm believed that the \u201cannouncement crossed lines in both messaging and execution.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the bridge before the L2, or not to allow withdrawals for three months, since we think it sets a bad precedent for other projects,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe also think much of the marketing cheapens the work of a serious team.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on. That said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution. For example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the\u2026 \u2014 Dan Robinson (@danrobinson) November 26, 2023\n\nBlast and Pacman did not respond to the comments. However, in advance of Robinson\u2019s tweet, Pacman wrote that Paradigm had not been involved in Blast\u2019s go-to-market rollout, and that the VC firm\u2014which co-led Blast\u2019s $20 million raise\u2014had already asked the Blast team to make some changes.\n\nHe added that Paradigm\u2019s suggestions were \u201cunder active consideration,\u201d but that it would ultimately be Blast\u2019s call.\n\nIn December, Robinson tweeted that Paradigm had worked with Blast to develop a \u201cnew time-locked upgrade system,\u201d which he said would \u201cset a better precedent for future projects who may try to emulate them.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

This kind of behavior is expected before a major event that can have a considerable impact on the price action, and in the crypto market\u2019s case, it is the upcoming spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nEthereum price sees another bout of growth\n\nEthereum price trading at $2,433 recently breached a crucial resistance level marked at $2,334. This price point is key to a historically known bullish pattern called the inverse head and shoulder formation.\n\nThe Head and shoulder formation generally signals a bearish outcome, but this pattern does the opposite. Inverse head and shoulders is a reversal pattern that is formed by three consecutive lows along with two intermediate highs. The first and third lows are called shoulders, located approximately at the same level above the second low \u2013 the head. Another important line is the one drawn along the intermediate highs \u2013 the neckline.\n\nThe pattern is completed only when the right shoulder rises above the neckline, suggesting that further rallying will be akin to the height of the head.\n\nIn the case of ETH, the height of the head marks a $218 growth, placing the target at $218 above $2,334. This brings the expected rise to $2,551, marking a 9.3% growth. Since, on the 8-hour chart, Ethereum price has already satisfied the pattern with the breach of the neckline, there is room for further growth.\n\nETH/USD 8-hour chart\n\nTrading at $2,433, ETH could still rise by another 5% before reaching the target price, breaching which would set the altcoin up for an increase to $3,000.\n\nPrice indicators, Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), are both exhibiting room for bullishness.\n\nEthereum RSI and MACD\n\nHowever, a failed breach of the target price could bring ETH back down to $2,400, which could happen if short-term traders look for profit-taking as well, invalidating the bullish thesis."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a way to reduce the load on the Ethereum blockchain and make its proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus \u201cconsiderably simpler and lighter.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 28, Vitalik Buterin proposed a method of reducing the number of signatures that validators are required to make to keep the network running, thus reducing load.\n\nEthereum currently supports a very high number of validators, around 895,000, to try to achieve decentralization and allow regular people to participate in staking.\n\nHowever, supporting this many validators comes with major technical downsides as it requires the network to process a huge number of signatures, around 28,000 per slot, \u201cwhich is a very high load,\u201d he noted.\n\nA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 27, 2023\n\nMoreover, supporting this load entails several sacrifices, such as limiting quantum resistance, complicated forking, and scaling signatures through zero-knowledge proofs (SNARKs), he explained.\n\nIt also does not fully achieve the goal of enabling ordinary people to participate, as the 32 ETH minimum to become a validator is still too high for many.\n\nInstead of trying to make an ever-increasing number of signatures per slot work, Buterin advocated moving to a moderate solution with around 8,192 signatures per slot down from the current 28,000.\n\nThis would allow major technical simplification, make the chain more quantum-resistant, and still keep the total slashable ETH high at around 1-2 million ETH. Slashing is a mechanism put in place to enforce good validator behavior.\n\nButerin suggested three potential approaches: relying entirely on decentralized staking pools, a two-tiered system with \u201cheavy\u201d and \u201clight\u201d staking, and rotating participation with accountable committees.\n\nThe proposed solutions aim to reduce the digital signature load to a manageable level.\n\nCalculations for a rotating participation method. Source: ethresear.ch\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin warns against overloading Ethereum consensus layer\n\nThe key advantage would be setting the future signature load at a manageable level, making protocol and infrastructure development much easier.\n\n\u201cThe future load of the Ethereum protocol becomes no longer an unknown,\u201d he said before concluding that \u201cit can be raised in the future through hard forks, but only when developers are confident that technology has improved enough to be able to handle a larger number of signatures-per-slot with the same level of ease.\u201d\n\nIn May, Vitalik Buterin warned of the dangers of \u201cstretching\u201d Ethereum\u2019s consensus past its core functions of validating blocks and securing the network.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum scaling solutions have been the focal point for both users and developers in the Ethereum ecosystem. Cofounder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin recently made an affirming statement about the progress of Ethereum's scaling solutions, specifically rollups. His commendation of one project reaching stage 1 and optimism for others approaching this milestone highlights the strides being made in enhancing Ethereum's capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA rollup is a layer-2 solution that executes transactions outside the Ethereum mainnet (layer 1) but posts transaction data on it. This approach allows the network to handle more transactions per second, mitigating congestion and potentially lowering fees. The classification of these rollups into stages \u2013 from 0 to 2 \u2013 is crucial for assessing their maturity and functionality.\n\nVitalik: I'm really happy we have one unambiguously stage 1 rollup (Arbitrum One) and a couple more very-close-to-stage-1 rollups this year. Let's get to ten stage 1 rollups and some degree of sequencer decentralization in the next year. https://t.co/yiGfKwea9Q pic.twitter.com/zd8zrGigo7 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 28, 2023\n\nStage 1 is a significant achievement for any rollup. It indicates a fully operational proof system, the ability for at least five external participants to submit fraud proofs, permissionless exits for users, and the establishment of a security council. Arbitrum One's achievement of this stage demonstrates its capability to support Ethereum's scalability securely and reliably.\n\nHowever, Buterin's call to action for 10 stage-1 rollups within the next year, along with some degree of sequencer decentralization, is both ambitious and necessary. Sequencer decentralization would ensure that the ordering of transactions is not controlled by a single party, which is critical for maintaining the trustless and decentralized ethos of blockchain technology.\n\nThe drive for stage-1 rollups brings both advantages and challenges. On the upside, a greater number of stage-1 rollups would increase Ethereum's throughput significantly, thereby supporting more users and applications. It could also drive down transaction costs and improve user experience, making Ethereum more competitive in the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nOn the flip side, the rapid scaling of rollups must not compromise security or decentralization. The complexity of establishing a reliable security council and the rigorous requirements to enable multiple entities to submit fraud proofs are nontrivial."

        "content": "Exploring the Dynamic Shifts in the Cryptocurrency Landscape: Solana Catches Fire & Ethereum Continues to Evolve DragonLore Labs \u00b7 Follow 4 min read \u00b7 Dec 29, 2023 -- Listen Share\n\nWhere Are We Now?\n\nIn recent months, the cryptocurrency market has experienced a notable shift, led primarily by Solana\u2019s dynamic activity. Solana has not only sustained its momentum but also introduced new and engaging activities on its blockchain, attracting considerable attention. Avalanche and Injective have followed suit, showcasing impressive gains. Newer blockchains such as SEI, SUI, and APTOS have also emerged, gaining traction with noticeable price increases and heightened market activities. This period, marking the second half of 2022, has been predominantly bullish in terms of building activities and blockchain updates, including significant advancements in layer 2 solutions like Polygon Matic, Optimism, and Arbitrum. This positive trend is also reflected in their price, indicating a healthy market environment.\n\nWhat Is Happening Currently with the Cryptocurrency Market?\n\nThe current landscape of the cryptocurrency market is a fascinating blend of innovation, adaptation, and a growing diversification of blockchain technologies. As users increasingly explore alternatives to Bitcoin and Ethereum, blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, Injective, SEI, SUI, and APTOS are gaining prominence. This shift is driven by several factors, chief among them being lower transaction fees and the provision of novel, user-friendly tools for developers.\n\nLower Fees and Enhanced User Experience\n\nOne of the primary attractions of these emerging blockchains is their significantly lower transaction fees compared to the more established Ethereum network. These reduced costs make them more accessible to a broader user base, facilitating a range of transactions from micro-transactions to large-scale transfers. Furthermore, the enhanced user experience, characterized by faster transaction speeds and improved scalability, adds to their appeal.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Continued Evolution\n\nDespite the spotlight on these newer blockchains, Ethereum remains a central figure in the cryptocurrency narrative. Ethereum\u2019s ongoing development is noteworthy, particularly with its transition to Ethereum proof-of-stake, aiming to address issues related to scalability, security, and sustainability. This transition, coupled with the growing popularity of Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 solutions like Polygon Matic, Optimism, and Arbitrum, signifies a robust and evolving ecosystem. These layer 2 solutions reduce congestion on the main Ethereum blockchain, thereby lowering gas fees and enhancing transaction efficiency.\n\nThe Rise of Layer 2 Solutions\n\nThe rise of layer 2 solutions is a key trend in the current market. By handling transactions off the main Ethereum chain, these platforms significantly improve transaction speeds and reduce costs, making decentralized applications more practical for everyday use. Polygon Matic, Optimism, and Arbitrum, among others, are not just supporting Ethereum\u2019s scalability but also fostering an environment conducive to new developments and innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nHolistic Development\n\nThe current phase of the cryptocurrency market is not just about the competition among different blockchains but also about a holistic development of the ecosystem. There\u2019s a concerted effort to improve the underlying technology, user interfaces, and applications. This comprehensive approach aims to make blockchain technology more accessible, efficient, and relevant to a broader audience.\n\nLooking at the Solana Memecoin Madness\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain activity has recently been dominated by the trading of various memecoins, including Bonk, Wif, Popcat, Rock, and Kpop. These tokens have garnered immense popularity, leading to increased trading activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Raydium, Jupiter, and others. Additionally, the Jupiter airdrop has attracted considerable interest, fueling the farming activities. Alongside these developments, Solana NFTs are also experiencing a resurgence in popularity, with new collections emerging and existing ones like Solana Surfers gaining renewed interest.\n\nThe Current Market Momentum\n\nDespite the surge in activity around newer blockchains and cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum maintain their status as the market leaders. However, other layer 1 blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, and Injective are witnessing increased user activity, which in turn is influencing buying activities and leading to more substantial price increases, especially among coins with smaller market caps than Ethereum and Bitcoin. While Ethereum and Bitcoin continue to lead, it\u2019s evident that other blockchains, particularly Solana, are experiencing their moments in the spotlight, contributing to a more diversified and dynamic cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nIn my last article, I discussed the need for productive adoption and decentralized finance in the crypto space, especially in the wake of the FTX fallout. The distrust in centralized entities, while not entirely negative, underscores the importance of decentralized, permissionless systems. Speculation, while a constant presence, can be redirected towards utility and innovation. Calculated risks in new technologies are necessary, but they must be balanced with substantial development.\n\nThe focus should now be on building decentralized, transparent, and community-owned platforms and applications. As we move out of the bear market, we\u2019re entering a new phase where technology, community, and meaningful applications are valued more than ever.\n\nThis transition marks the beginning of a new era in the cryptocurrency world, one that holds promise for real utility and innovation beyond mere speculation. The future remains optimistic for cryptocurrencies, especially for those providing tangible benefits and utility. With continued patience and perseverance, the next wave of crypto innovation is set to attract builders and users who are focused on fundamentals, paving the way for a more stable and robust digital asset landscape.\n\nStay Connected\n\nJoin my the telegram channel: https://t.me/cryptoblueninja"

They are all effectively under heavy \u201cre-staking\u201d incentives not to withhold data or mess with the state root between the chains,\u201d his post reads.\n\nWhile Yakovenko\u2019s initial post on the subject was shared on December 25, media reports failed to see the initial ironic intention behind the post. By all means, Solana is bigger as a protocol when compared to the next capitalized Ethereum L2, Polygon and it has a thriving ecosystem that will undoubtedly prevent it from staying under the shadows of Ethereum.\n\nOver the past few months, there have been a lot of controversial community talks between members of the Solana and Ethereum communities in which some of the former try to elevate their technologies over the latter. This narrative was deepened as Solana started flipping Ethereum in key performance metrics.\n\nYakovenko has time and again tried to caution the community against such narratives and this latest post might be another way to show both can co-exist.\n\nEqual Ecosystem Criticism\n\nWithin the space of 2 weeks, the duo of Ethereum and Solana have faced intense criticism from some market analysts who took out time to highlight the flaws of both protocols.\n\nPeter Brandt recently took on Ethereum, noting that he has shorted the coin as he believes it is on its way to a low of $650. He based his bearish assumptions on the fact that Ethereum is unfriendly to use as a result of expensive network or gas fees. Solana on the other hand got its first major critic in Fred Krueger who said many of the innovations being pushed out by the protocol are \u201cpure science fiction.\u201d\n\nWhile neither of the blockchain protocols is perfect, Yakovenko\u2019s post is an indication that both can truly exist together with more benefit to the broader crypto ecosystem."

He said his encounter with Vitalik dates back to 2015 when he just entered Jack Ma\u2019s Hupan University in a bid to make a dive into the crypto world.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe said he and Vitalik Buterin discussed Ethereum, the crypto project that just launched at the time. While the Tron Founder acknowledged he had bought a massive quantity of Ethereum at the time, he said there was no active wallet to store the acquired assets. This made him suggest to Vitalik that there is a need to build a decentralized wallet with many prototypes presented to him by the latter.\n\nJustin Sun acknowledged that though after close to a decade, he and Vitalik Buterin are building in different ways, the underlying ideology remains the same.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, recently outlined a trio of potential solutions to address a critical complexity issue in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. His proposals, targeting the burgeoning challenge of managing digital signatures within the Ethereum network, were detailed in a post on the Ethereum Research forum. Buterin focuses on streamlining the process to require only 8,192 signatures per slot, simplifying and lightening the network\u2019s load.\n\nVitalik Buterin Unveils Two-Tier Staking System Idea\n\nThe first approach Vitalik Buterin suggests involves the transformation of staking pools. By increasing the minimum ether required to run a validator, smaller validator operations would need to combine their resources. This consolidation aims to reduce the overall number of validators, thereby lessening the signature workload.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis solution is about scaling down the number of participants and fostering a more collaborative and resource-shared environment within the Ethereum network. While compelling in its simplicity, this method raises questions about the impact on smaller validators and the potential centralization of power among larger staking pools.\n\nButerin\u2019s second proposal introduces a two-tier staking system. This novel approach distinguishes between stakers with varying responsibilities and requirements. The two layers of stakers would be integrated differently in the block finalization process, with one layer shouldering heavier requirements and the other operating under lighter ones.\n\nThis bifurcation could create a more balanced system, where responsibilities and rewards are aligned with the capabilities and commitments of different stakers. However, this solution also introduces complexity in managing these two distinct groups and ensuring fair and effective participation from both.\n\nNew Ethereum Model Aims to Reduce Signatures\n\nThe final solution put forth by Buterin involves a rotating system of validators. In this model, a random set of validators would be selected for each slot, distributing the workload more evenly across the network. While this approach could effectively reduce the number of signatures needed, it introduces new complexities.\n\nThe random selection process must ensure fairness and transparency while maintaining network security and efficiency. This solution balances reducing the signature burden and maintaining a diverse and decentralized pool of validators.\n\nEach of these proposed solutions by Buterin comes with its advantages and challenges. The central theme in all three is the balancing act between reducing the signature workload and maintaining the decentralized ethos of the Ethereum network.\n\nRead Also: Ether Poised to Outshine Bitcoin in 2024, ETC Group Report Predicts"

        "content": "Share:\n\nLiquid Staking protocols ended the reign of Decentralized Exchanges (DEX), taking the spot of the second-biggest protocol after Lending.\n\nLiquid Staking still single-handedly eclipsed Lending as Lido DAO surpassed the TVL of AAVE and JustLend.\n\nAdditionally, when it comes to growth, Liquid Staking outperformed Lending, increasing by 334% and 176%, respectively.\n\nWith the year coming to an end, the DeFi market is also locking in the changes witnessed throughout 2023. One key change was the Ethereum Shapella hard fork that not only impacted the market but seemingly altered the face of the Decentralized (DeFi) market entirely.\n\nEthereum Shapella hard fork\n\nEthereum mainnet went through the Shanghai hard fork earlier this year in April, which enabled the option to withdraw the ETH staked by validators. This occasion was expected to be a hugely bearish event as the crypto market feared that the investors might choose to pull out their staked ETH.\n\nHowever, following the hard fork, the opposite happened as more money started pouring into staking protocols. With the option and safety of withdrawing their assets at any time, investors went in deep with staking, the result of which could be seen on the DeFi market.\n\nThe category of Liquid Staking protocols witnessed an increase starting in March, and by the end of June, it surpassed the Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) category. DEXes reigned as the second biggest protocol category since 2021, which came to an end.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, the total value locked (TVL) in Liquid Staking protocols increased by 334%, which is nearly twice the 176% growth witnessed by DEXes in the same period. Today, the former holds over $32 billion in TVL, while the latter contributes $21 billion to the DeFi market.\n\nDeFi market TVL distribution\n\nThe surge in Liquid Staking was such that Lido DAO, the biggest protocol in this category, outshined other top DeFi applications (Dapp), including AAVE, which belongs to the Lending category, the biggest by TVL. Today, Lido has over $22.3 billion worth of TVL, which is twice AAVE\u2019s $10.9 billion.\n\nTop DeFi protocols by TVL\n\nCome 2024, the demand for DeFi is expected to increase, and naturally, investors will choose to put their money in the safest form of returns, which could be being a validator on Ethereum. This will further boost the steady rise of TVL of Liquid Staking protocol, making it likely unsurpassable by any other Dapp category."

Apr '22 price action was part of preceding bear trend pic.twitter.com/yFvPj2ul3n \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 28, 2023\n\nTypically, the pattern develops during long-term uptrends or downtrends. Most technical experts regard it as a \"continuation pattern,\" implying that the overall market trend will most likely restart.\n\nInstead, Brandt highlights a wedge pattern on the Ethereum price chart, which is defined by converging trend lines connecting the corresponding highs and lows of a price series.\n\nA wedge, on the other hand, frequently predicts a price reversal. According to Brandt, the correct starting point for this intriguing pattern was the August 2022 high, and not the April 2022 high. Brandt adds that the April 2022 price action was rather part of the preceding bear trend.\n\nEthereum jumped to a high of $2,448 in today's trading, its highest level since May 2022. At the time of writing, ETH had slightly retreated from this high, albeit still up in the last 24 hours. ETH was up by 1.47% in the last 24 hours to $2,364, per CoinMarketCap data.\n\nIf the bulls keep pushing, Ethereum might reach $3,000. A breach below $2,200, on the other hand, may cause the price of ETH to fall to lower levels. As a result, the bulls must continue to defend this level, as a dip below it may trigger a further downturn to $1,900 and perhaps $1,750."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a sudden surge, breaking through the $2,400 mark and achieving a new high for the year. The cryptocurrency market, which has been notably volatile in recent weeks, witnessed ETH leading a robust rally, pushing major implied volatilities (IVs) to yearly highs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, what is intriguing is that institutional fear of missing out (FOMO) has yet to kick in, as noted by prominent market observers. Greeks.live, a cryptocurrency analytics platform, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share insights on Ethereum's recent performance. According to their tweet, the surge in ETH has not only propelled it to breach the $2,400 barrier but has also resulted in all major term IVs soaring to yearly highs.\n\nThe long-dormant #ETH led a new rally, breaking above $2,400 to a new high for the year, driving all major term IVs back to yearly highs, and DVOL back to 70%, also a new high since April.\n\n\n\nLooking at options data, Skew remains at recent levels and has not followed the rally,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/jhTjj5n23s \u2014 Greeks.live (@GreeksLive) December 28, 2023\n\nAdditionally, the daily volume (DVOL) spiked to 70%, reaching a level not seen since April. Analyzing options data, the tweet pointed out that the skew, a measure of the perceived distribution of potential price outcomes, has not followed the rally. This suggests that institutional traders are yet to fully embrace the FOMO associated with ETH's bullish run .\n\nMarket dynamics\n\nThe tweet also touched upon market dynamics, emphasizing the tight year-end liquidity conditions. It suggested that such conditions make the market susceptible to sudden spikes and falls. However, it noted a favorable breakeven ratio on options purchases, indicating a potential opportunity for strategic investors.\n\nAs of the latest available data, Ethereum is currently priced at $2,380, reflecting a notable 6.49% increase in the last 24 hours. Over the past 30 days, ETH has experienced an impressive surge of 18.88%. The trading volume of Ethereum has also witnessed a substantial uptick, rising by 84.35% in the last 24 hours and currently standing at $17.9 billion.\n\nDespite the impressive gains, the subdued response from institutional traders has left the market speculating about the potential catalysts that could trigger their entry into the FOMO-driven rally. Whether this is a brief pause before a larger institutional influx or a sign of cautious optimism remains to be seen. The cryptocurrency market, known for its unpredictability, continues to be a source of both excitement and speculation as the year draws to a close."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently seen a significant increase in its market performance.\n\nVarious factors possibly contributing to ETH\u2019s surge include the increased trading volume and a rise in daily active addresses.\n\nThe article discusses future projections for ETH, including opinions from analysts and potential impacts on Ethereum-related cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhy is the Ethereum (ETH) Price up?\n\nEthereum\u2019s native token \u2013 ETH \u2013 was among the best-performing crypto assets on December 28, with its price surpassing $2,400 (the highest level since May 2022). Consequently, its market capitalization briefly exceeded the $292 billion tag. Despite retracing from its yesterday\u2019s peak, \u0415TH is still up around 13% in the past 30 days.\n\n\n\nETH\u2019s price increase is in line with the development of other important on-chain metrics.\n\nFor instance, the Total Value Locked in the network has increased from around $25b at the beginning of the month to almost $30b at the end.\n\nMoreover, the on-chain trading volumes of Ethereum have also seen an uptick, remaining above $1 billion per day for the larger part of December and exceeding $2 billion on December 28th.\n\nEthereum daily active addresses have jumped, too. YCharts estimated that their number hit almost 500,000 on December 28, representing a 33% increase compared to the observed data a month ago.\n\n\n\nThe Recent Altcoin Resurgence\n\nETH\u2019s price jump is also part of the overall Altcoin rally. Despite slightly retracing in the past few hours, Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Polkadot (DOT), and more are well in the green for the last week, while Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a minor correction.\n\nThe aforementioned trend has led to a reduced BTC dominance. This is the metric that tracks its share relative to that of the rest of the market, and it\u2019s currently sitting at around 47.8% (per CoinGecko), down from 50% at the beginning of December."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price is encountering significant resistance around the pivotal $2.4K region, highlighting an ongoing struggle between buyers and sellers.\n\nDespite efforts, the price has been unable to surpass its previous swing high of $2403, leading to a slight pullback and the potential formation of a double-top pattern.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nAfter a period of sideways consolidation near the crucial $2.3K mark, the price surged with the aim of reclaiming its previous daily swing high at $2403. This upward movement is underscored by the occurrence of a golden cross on the daily chart, indicating an overall bullish sentiment for Ethereum\u2019s price action.\n\nHowever, the price faced resistance upon reaching a critical zone formed by the upper boundary of a multi-month wedge, coinciding with the previous daily swing at $2403, thereby forming a potential double-top pattern.\n\nDespite these challenges, the emergence of a potential head and shoulders pattern, a widely recognized bearish reversal formation, is notable. If the price breaks below the neckline of both the head and shoulders pattern and the double-top pattern, it could signal a short-term downward movement. This retracement might lead the price back to the substantial support range at $2K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nA more detailed analysis of the 4-hour chart reveals increased demand within the critical range between the 0.5 ($2,211) and 0.618 ($2,166) levels of the Fibonacci retracement indicator. This demand led to an impulsive price spike attempting to breach the $2.4K daily swing high.\n\nHowever, Ethereum faced a slight rejection, resulting in a retracement toward the static support level at $2.3K. Despite this retracement, Ethereum\u2019s price appears to be confined within a crucial range, encompassing the significant $2.4K resistance region and the substantial static support range characterized by the 0.5 ($2,211) and 0.618 ($2,166) Fibonacci retracement levels, along with the dynamic support provided by the multi-week ascending trendline.\n\nA breakout in either direction from this range could signal the initiation of a new impulsive trend.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nWithin the domain of on-chain data analysis, exploring the sentiment reflected in the futures market provides valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s overarching perspective.\n\nThe provided chart portrays the 30-day standard moving average of the Ethereum taker buy-sell ratio. This metric indicates whether buyers or sellers are executing more aggressively on aggregate (taker orders). Values below 1 are perceived as bearish, while values above 1 are indicative of bullish sentiment.\n\nUpon examination of the chart, a notable trend emerges: the taker buy-sell ratio has consistently remained below 1 over the past six months.\n\nDespite the recent uptrend in price, the metric has entered a consolidation phase, signaling an overall bearish sentiment among futures traders. Should the taker buy-sell ratio suddenly surge above 1 again, it would suggest a shift to a full-fledged bull market, potentially propelling the price to new yearly highs."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the original visions of Web3 have \u201cfaded somewhat into the background\u201d with many projects shifting away from the core idea of decentralization.\n\nIn a blog post titled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again\u201d published today, Buterin wrote that there is a large ideological rift \u201cwhere significant parts of the non-blockchain decentralization community see the crypto world as a distraction, and not as a kindred spirit and a powerful ally.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the term Web3 was originally coined by Ethereum cofounder Gavin Wood. \u201cRather than seeing it, as I initially did, as \u2018Bitcoin plus smart contracts,\u2019 Gavin thought about it more broadly as one of a set of technologies that could together form the base layer of a more open internet stack.\u201d\n\nButerin said that people use cryptocurrency to send and save money in many countries, but they often do this through centralized means, \u201ceither through internal transfers on centralized exchange accounts or by trading USDT on Tron.\u201d\n\nRise in transaction fees\n\nButerin pointed out that the \u201cnumber one culprit\u201d he would blame as the root cause of the shift is the rise in transaction fees.\n\n\u201cWhen the cost of writing to the chain is $0.001, or even $0.1, you could imagine people making all kinds of applications that use blockchains in various ways, including non-financial ways,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut when transaction fees go to over $100, \u201cdegen gamblers\u201d would remain willing or become even more willing to play, he added.\n\nWhen degen gamblers \u2014 often considered high-risk traders \u2014 become the largest group using the chain on a large scale, \u201cthis adjusts the public perception and the crypto space's internal culture,\u201d he said.\n\nPositive developments\n\nWhile Buterin pointed out the existing issues in the community, he also outlined the positive developments within Ethereum in 2023. He wrote that advancements in scaling solutions like rollups, second-generation privacy solutions, and the emergence of account abstraction and light clients could offer hope for a revival of the decentralized ethos.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nButerin said that there is a growing awareness that unchecked centralization and over-financialization cannot be what crypto is about. Such increasing realization and the key technologies mentioned above \u201ctogether present us with an opportunity to take things in a different direction,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs\n\nZero-knowledge proofs and their increasing developer-friendliness open new possibilities for consumer applications and privacy-preserving technologies, according to Buterin.\n\nButerin envisions a future where Ethereum becomes a hub for a range of applications \u2014 from decentralized social media to secure, anonymous voting systems.\n\n\u201cThese technologies are most widely adopted as ways of improving Ethereum's scalability, as ZK rollups, but they are also very useful for privacy,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cIn particular, the programmability of zero-knowledge proofs means that we can get past the false binary of \u2018anonymous but risky\u2019 vs \u2018KYC'd therefore safe,\u2019 and get privacy and many kinds of authentication and verification at the same time,\u201d he added.\n\nReiterating core values\n\nButerin also urged the Ethereum community to follow the core values \u2014 open global participation, decentralization, censorship resistance, auditability, credible neutrality, cooperative mindset and tool building.\n\n\u201cIt is very possible to build things within the crypto ecosystem that do not follow these values,\u201d he said. \u201cOne can build a system that one calls a \u2018layer 2,\u2019 but which is actually a highly centralized system secured by a multisig, with no plans to ever switch to something more secure.\u201d\n\n\u201cResisting these pressures is hard, but if we do not do so, then we risk losing the unique value of the crypto ecosystem, and recreating a clone of the existing web2 ecosystem with extra inefficiencies and extra steps,\u201d he added."

        "content": "Share:\n\nNear Protocol (NEAR) price shows clear signs of bullish failure as the altcoin produces lower lows and fractures an important uptrend support line. NEAR holders can expect a quick double-digit pullback soon.\n\nNear Protocol price rallied 121% between December 18 and 25, setting up a local top at $4.62. Since then, NEAR has shed 11% and currently trades at $4.09. This down move has shattered the trendline connecting the five lower highs NEAR produced during its rally, confirming the start of a trend reversal.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) price shows no signs of slowing down after rallying nearly 24% this week. This massive uptrend could slow down soon as BNB approaches key weekly hurdles.\n\nBinance Coin price has registered a 24% rally this week, rallying from $264 to $327, where it currently trades. BNB currently tugs with the Momentum Reversal Indicator\u2019s (MRI) resistance level at $322. Additionally, the Binance-based altcoin will face the range high at $337, which has been a key hurdle since it was first formed in May 2022.\n\nWith the year coming to an end, the DeFi market is also locking in the changes witnessed throughout 2023. One key change was the Ethereum Shapella hard fork that not only impacted the market but seemingly altered the face of the Decentralized (DeFi) market entirely.\n\nEthereum mainnet went through the Shanghai hard fork earlier this year in April, which enabled the option to withdraw the ETH staked by validators. This occasion was expected to be a hugely bearish event as the crypto market feared that the investors might choose to pull out their staked ETH."

This is because every scalability solution is called Layer 2, which is not always technically correct, as not all solutions fall into this category. If you try to understand this on your own, it is extremely difficult to find accurate and clear answers to these questions. So in this article, we will take a closer look at some of the most popular Ethereum scalability solutions today and find out how they differ from each other. We will also understand exactly what sidechain, layer 2, ZK rollup and optimistic rollup are."

        "title": "Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Says Original Web3 Vision Has Been Lost - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "In a new blog post, Vitalik Buterin noted the loss of the original web3 values, the ways that the community can get back on track, and the progress that Ethereum has made so far.\n\nVitalik Buterin has always been a big personality. As one of the founders of Ethereum, he has been a major figure within the crypto world for over a decade. He is also known for being outspoken about his views, which has sometimes led to him feuding with others. But his most recent blog post, published by Buterin on his personal blog, seems him calling out the current culture within the crypto industry and claiming that the initial vision of web3 has been lost.\n\nButerin Speaking on the Lost Vision of Web3\n\nIn the post titled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again\u201d, Buterin recalled several trips he took in the early 2010s to places in the world that had a concentration of crypto businesses. He had said that this sort of community where all parts work together was the initial goal of Web3.\n\nBut with time, he says this vision has not been preserved. According to him, some in the decentralization community see crypto as a distraction as opposed to a useful tool. And even among crypto users, he notes that the only non-financial application that is being used on a large scale is the Ethereum Naming Service (ENS). When crypto is used as a means of payment or transfers, Buterin points out that it is done, \u201ceither through internal transfers on centralized exchange accounts, or by trading USDT on Tron.\u201d\n\nAnd what is to blame for this? According to Buterin, transaction fees are the number one culprit. He says that when the cost of writing to the chain is $0.001 or $0.1, there is more potential use of it, even for non-financial reasons. But when transaction fees cross the $100 mark during bull runs, the major group that remains is degen gamblers. In moderation, he believes that they are not too much of a risk but that there are too many of them in the community.\n\nEthereum Now and Beyond\n\nIn the blog post, Buterin highlighted some of the positive developments that have taken place in the Ethereum community. He talked about the launch of rollups and second-generation privacy solutions like Railway and Nocturne. He also acknowledged zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and light clients as benefiting the network in terms of scale, user privacy, and much more.\n\nHe pointed out that there is a growing understanding that unchecked centralization and over-financialization cannot be the essence of crypto and that other values must be embraced. Some of the values he highlighted were auditability, censorship resistance, decentralization, open global participation, and so on.\n\nThe blog ended on an optimistic note about the Ethereum network and could hint at even more developments being rolled out in 2024. From what we\u2019ve seen, Buterin believes that a change needs to come to the crypto and blockchain scene and we could see the results of this very soon."

        "content": "A new token in its ICO presale stage aims to enter the crypto market with a noteworthy ambition: Becoming Ethereum\u2019s premier store-of-value (SOV) asset.\n\nBranded \u201cMollars\u201d, this new project is being hailed a prospect for a pivotal role in the network, especially as Ether becomes more deflationary. And because Bitcoin, the top SOV asset, has seen fees soar recently.\n\nAccording to its whitepaper, Mollars will be an ownerless currency, with a max supply of 10,000,000 tokens minted. This means that right out of the gate, the project will enter the market as one of the most limited currencies in the landscape.\n\nThe token is currently on presale, priced at $0.30. However, as the ICO sale completes and the token is listed on its first crypto exchange, $MOLLARS will debut to the public at a price of $0.62. The public exchange pricing means that investors joining the presale during this \u2018private exchange\u2019 ICO period could see a 100% ROI days after it closes.\n\nIn the long run, as the \u2018new bitcoin\u2019 for the Ethereum blockchain world grows in popularity, the overall value of the token could be much higher. As it asserts its role as Ethereum\u2019s Store of Value asset, the end price has no ceiling and there\u2019s a potential to create new crypto millionaires.\n\nWhat Are Store-of-Value Coins?\n\nThe reason traders love such coins as $MOLLARS and $BTC is because store-of-value cryptocurrencies are digital assets specifically designed to retain purchasing power over time.\n\nTypically, the investment world always had precious metals such as Gold [AU] and Silver as storages of value, particularly in economic-uncertain times. In crypto, assets like Bitcoin have already proven their worth as SOVs during the pandemic, which opened the way for wider adoption of these types of currencies.\n\nUltimately, currencies like Bitcoin are considered safer investment vehicles due to their limited supply and decentralized nature. Their primary function is to preserve wealth, offering a hedge against inflation and economic instability. Unlike traditional fiat currencies prone to devaluation, store-of-value cryptocurrencies utilize blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, immutability, and scarcity. Investors often view them as a long-term store of wealth, relying on their stability and potential for future appreciation in value.\n\nHow Can $MOLLARS Serve as SOV in Ethereum Blockchain\n\nAnticipated for its limited supply of 10 million tokens and seamless ERC-20 compatibility, Mollars is projected to emerge as a pioneering solution catering to the need for stability, cost-efficiency, and enhanced functionality in managing digital assets.\n\nEnthusiasts foresee a strategic shift among Bitcoin holders toward Mollars tokens as a preferred vehicle for storing value, leveraging Ethereum\u2019s anticipated advancements in speed, reduced transaction costs, and expanded capabilities. This envisioned transition to Mollars would circumvent challenges such as potential congestion and high fees prevalent on the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring swifter transactions and capitalizing on Ethereum\u2019s forthcoming smart contract functionalities.\n\nThe envisioned adoption of Mollars as a future store of value extends beyond pragmatic cost-saving measures; it signifies an opportunity for diversified asset allocation across multiple blockchains. Embracing its interoperability within Ethereum\u2019s evolving ecosystem, Mollars is projected to grant users access to upcoming decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) innovations while safeguarding their assets within a dependable and stable token.\n\nMollars Could Be Worth 100 Times More In the Future\n\nThe currency\u2019s limited supply and potential as an SOV puts Mollars as a contender for the cryptocurrency market\u2019s next \u2018x100Gem\u2019.\n\nThe current presale offering at $0.30, will reach $0.62 on listing day, hints at an immediate potential for a 100% return on investment (ROI). However, the currency\u2019s underlying ambition as an SOV suggests a much larger prospective value.\n\nExperts and early investors are eyeing Mollars as a potential growth catalyst, projecting a scenario where its value could skyrocket, potentially worth 100 times more than its current price. Such substantial growth projections stem from the combination of Ethereum\u2019s anticipated advancements, Bitcoin holders\u2019 strategic transition, and Mollars\u2019 role as a stable, cross-chain asset.\n\nThe concept of a store-of-value token like Mollars represents a paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency market, mirroring the broader global trend of seeking stable and secure assets amidst economic uncertainties. As Mollars inches closer to its initial coin offering (ICO) and subsequent launch, the market anticipation for its potential valuation amplifies, setting the stage for a promising future as an integral part of Ethereum\u2019s digital asset ecosystem.\n\nCurrently just under 31,000 tokens have been sold.

        "content": "Manta Network\u2019s Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain Manta Pacific has seen its total value locked (TVL) skyrocket to nearly $370 million within two weeks.\n\nThe project\u2019s surge in TVL could be attributed to an airdrop event scheduled to happen in January 2024.\n\nManta Pacific Becomes 7th Biggest L2 on Ethereum\n\nManta Pacific recently introduced an airdrop event called New Paradigm to reward investors who bridge a minimum of 0.25 Ether (ETH) or its equivalent in stablecoins to the blockchain with MANTA tokens. The team behind the project announced the allocation of 50 million Manta tokens for participants, with the airdrop requiring invite codes.\n\nMeanwhile, the campaign, which is expected to last till January 2024, offers users the opportunity to get yields through multiple sources. Investors can also collect non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by opening lucky boxes based on the amount bridged.\n\nFurthermore, users who deposit ETH on Manta Pacific will get a yield-bearing token called STONE, with yield obtained from staking Ether on layer one, thanks to its partnership with liquid staking protocol StakeStone. On the other hand, those who deposit USDC will receive a yield-bearing stablecoin called wUSDM, with yield from US Treasury Bills.\n\nUsually, people are not aware of airdrops, but these days, projects announce them, triggering a wave of enthusiasm shown by a wave of deposits. Since the announcement of New Paradigm on Dec. 14, more than $300 million has flown through the chain.\n\nAccording to data from Dune Analytics, Manta Pacific\u2019s TVL currently stands at $364.4 million, likely as a result of the anticipated airdrop. The spike in TVL catapulted Manta Pacific to seventh position, behind dYdX, making it among the top 10 biggest layer 2 networks on Ethereum.\n\nNew Layer 2 Networks Using Airdrop Campaigns to Attract Users\n\nThe development team behind Manta Network, P0x Labs, raised $25 million in Series A funding in July, raising the total valuation to $500 million. The funding, led by Polychain Capital and Qiming Venture Partners, also included other investors such as SevenX Ventures and Alliance.\n\nManta Pacific\u2019s steady TVL growth follows a similar trend by Blast, another Ethereum layer 2 blockchain. Like Manta, Blast is also planning an airdrop event for participants in January 2024.\n\nBlast\u2019s TVL has grown to over $1.1 billion since its launch in November, according to data by DefiLlama. As previously reported by CryptoPotato, the protocol attracted criticism, especially for its three-month restriction on withdrawals.\n\nAlso, scammers took advantage of Blast\u2019s popularity following its launch by using phishing links to steal over $130,000 from an unsuspecting victim."

        "content": "The last five days have seen a dip in Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum exchange reserve.\n\nAccording to a CryptoQuant analyst, this is typically followed by a rise in the coin\u2019s price.\n\nThe last five days have seen a decline in Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum [ETH] exchange reserve, pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Sunmoon stated in a new report.\n\nThis drop in reserves could mean that users are taking their ETH off the exchange, potentially due to the coin\u2019s recent price consolidation amid the surge in profit-taking activity, or seeking to move their ETH elsewhere.\n\nIt could also be that some users might be transferring their ETH from Coinbase to other wallets or platforms for various reasons, like staking, DeFi participation, or self-custody.\n\nRegardless of the reason, Sunmoon noted that this decline is a good sign for the coin\u2019s price. According to the analyst:\n\n\u201cThe price of Ethereum has often seen short-term gains when Coinbase ETH exchange reserve decreases.\u201d\n\nSunmoon added further that the current decline in Coinbase\u2019s ETH reserve marks the first time since the coin traded at the $1600 price level in September.\n\nIs Ether well poised for the predicted rally?\n\nAlthough market participants have stayed their hands from executing large trades due to the uncertainty around the coin\u2019s next price direction, it has managed a 20% uptick in the last month, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\nAt press time, the leading altcoin traded at $2391. Price movements observed on a daily chart revealed that bearish activities may have been subdued due to the re-emergence of the bulls.\n\nAccording to readings from ETH\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI), its positive directional index (green) crossed above the negative directional index (red) on 26th December.\n\nThis crossover often signifies a potential for a new uptrend in the underlying asset. Whenever it occurs, it means that upward momentum is overpowering downward momentum. Since 26th December, ETH\u2019s price has climbed by 5%.\n\nFurther, the coin\u2019s Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator confirmed the commencement of a new bull cycle. During the intraday trading session on 27th December, the MACD line intersected the trend line in an uptrend.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThis upward intersection came after the MACD line rested below the trend line for more than a week, suggesting that the ETH market saw increased coin sell-off.\n\nThe crossover showed that the shorter-term moving average has begun to accelerate faster than the longer-term moving average. This suggests increasing bullish momentum."

        "title": "Buterin proposes 'security through simplicity' to lighten Ethereum staking - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has published a new proposal that seeks to reduce the required number of signatures from validators to streamline the Ethereum network\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 27, 2023\n\nAccording to Buterin, the proposal aims to make Ethereum\u2019s consensus implementation \u201cconsiderably simpler and lighter\u201d by reducing the signature requirement per slot from roughly 28,000 to just 8,192 signatures.\n\nTo date, Ethereum has roughly 895,000 validators, with each validator being required to stake 32 ether (ETH) and become activated within the network. Ethereum does this to maintain decentralization and open access for more participants to help with staking, but this also results in more load on the network because of processing requirements.\n\n\u201cThe signature aggregation system feels reasonable at first glance, but in reality it creates systemic complexity that bleeds out all over the place,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nWith Buterin\u2019s proposal, the signature load for future upgrades would be predictable and limited, simplifying protocol and infrastructure development efforts. However, this also means that Ethereum\u2019s network load could still be increased through hard forks.\n\nButerin points out that such a system opens up compromises, limiting quantum security, complicated upgrades, and an apparent reliance on zero-knowledge proofs to manage scale.\n\nButerin believes that his proposal will simplify the proof-of-stake design and allow for a \u201clarge amount of technical simplification.\u201d\n\n\u201c[\u2026] instead of relying on cryptographers to create magic bullets (or magic bulletproofs) to make an ever-increasing number of signatures per slot possible, I propose that we make a philosophical pivot: move away from having such an expectation in the first place,\u201d the Ethereum co-founder stated.\n\nThe proposal provides three approaches to enable the reduction of required signatures: a shift to prioritizing reliance on decentralized staking pools, a two-tier system that provides options for \u201cheavy\u201d and \u201clight\u201d staking, and rotating validator subsets through committees.\n\nThe first approach suggests that Ethereum could discard direct access to the consensus layer in favor of using decentralized staking pools exclusively, raising deposit minimums but capping pool-related penalties to avoid over-reliance on operators.\n\nIn the second method, a two-tiered approach creates heavy-stake validators specifically assigned to finalize blocks. This is then supplemented by a lighter security layer that has no minimum thresholds to participate.\n\nThe third approach proposes a set construction that is proportional to a validator\u2019s stake weight and rotates participants dynamically.\n\nButerin notes that the third approach effectively decouples weight for incentive purposes (validator rewards) from stake weight for consensus purposes. This means that each validator\u2019s reward within the committee (based on an agreed-upon rotation) should be the same, keeping average rewards proportional to the balance.\n\n\u201cThe future load of the Ethereum protocol becomes no longer an unknown: it can be raised in the future through hard forks, but only when developers are confident that technology has improved enough to be able to handle a larger number of signatures-per-slot with the same level of ease,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nThe main tradeoff is between a significant reduction in validator participation per slot and increased technical feasibility and flexibility. The proposal aims to balance the network\u2019s decentralization and scalability, but its critics argue that the changes it carries may diverge from Ethereum\u2019s core philosophy.\n\nWhile the purpose of improving Ethereum\u2019s scalability with a leaner signature scheme may appear to be well-meaning, commentators on Vitalik\u2019s proposal have raised concerns about possible security flaws due to the reduced complexity, which may open new attack vectors if any of the three approaches are implemented. To this end, Buterin responded that streamlining the protocol design offers \u201csecurity through simplicity\u201d while enhancing the network\u2019s resilience against state-level attacks."

        "content": "A presumably \u201cSmart Money\u201d trader with a focus on Ethereum (ETH) has recorded a 100% win rate since the start of this quarter.\n\nThis trader, spotted by the crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, shows how the trader has maintained a very simple strategy thus far, featuring buying at a low price and selling at a relatively higher price.\n\nThe trader just dumped another 17,700 Ethereum stash valued at $42.19 million at an average price of $2,384. At the time of writing, Ethereum is changing hands at $2,394.18, up 6.15% in the past 24 hours. ETH currently has a market cap of $287,202,840,879 and trading volume of $18,050,227,583.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEthereum Trade, Same Pattern, Bullish Results\n\nAccording to the chart shared by Lookonchain, the Smart Whale made its first accumulation in the past 3 months around October 9 with two distinct buyups recorded. Another distinct accumulation came in late October but at a higher price than the previous stack.\n\nThe smart whale sold some of the stash at peak point in early November after which he made another accumulation almost immediately.\n\nAs observed in the shared chart, at least 2 more selloffs appeared on-chain in mid-November as the price of Ethereum journeys on to hit a monthly high of $2,102.15.\n\nThis smart money is really good at trading $ETH! After $ETH rose today, he dumped all 17,700 $ETH($42.19M) at $2,384, making ~$5.8M, and won again! In the past 3 months, he has always bought $ETH at price lows and sold at highs, with a 100% win rate!https://t.co/PtF8dSNlja pic.twitter.com/pRtRTlEEFo \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 28, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOne major observation in the Smart Whale strategy is that there are more accumulation days with strategic selloff points. Per the Lookonchain insight, the whale\u2019s latest selloff printed him an approximate profit of $5.8 million after an eclectic December growth.\n\nSmart Money Traders Takes Different Forms\n\nWhile the current emphasis is on a smart money trader with a high affinity for Ethereum, Smart Money traders are visible in every aspect of the digital currency ecosystem.\n\nAs reported earlier by The Crypto Basic, smart money traders are beginning to move trillions of Shiba Inu (SHIB) away from exchanges in what comes off as a race to HODL ahead of the launch of automated burning on Shibarium.\n\nIn all, Smart Money plays vary, with the end-goal being an attempt to record better profitability over time."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Holders Diversify: What About Axie Infinity (AXS) and Everlodge (ELDG)? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s superiority has shown over the last two months. The project\u2019s value has spiked to over $2,300, and Ethereum\u2019s daily trading volume has consistently hit over $10 billion across on-chain and centralized exchanges.\n\nTwo projects that could be worth watching are Axie Infinity and Everlodge. A recent update could reignite the fire behind Axie Infinity, and Everlodge\u2019s value continues to rise as its presale booms.\n\nEthereum ETF Delayed by The SEC\n\nOver the last 7 days, Ethereum has declined by 0.1%, and its daily trading volume has dropped to $9.7 billion. This decline has been triggered by two events.\n\nFirstly, the overall crypto market\u2019s growth has slowed. Many projects are down by over 5%, and investment activity has also declined. Secondly, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision on several Ethereum Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) applications.\n\nAccording to James Seyffart, Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst, delays have been made on applications from Hashdex and Grayscale, which were expected to be resolved before December 25th. The SEC has stated that the reason behind this delay is to gather more public input as to whether or not the Ethereum ETFs should be listed.\n\nAxie Infinity Looks To Rebuild Its Community\n\nIf you asked an NFT expert about the top P2E games ever created, Axie Infinity would be on this list. Axie Infinity rose to fame in 2021, though its value crashed following the 2022 bull market. Now, the project announced that it plans to rebuild its community through exclusive merchandise.\n\nAxie Infinity holders who own Mystic and Origin Axies will now be able to create their own exclusive merchandise. This decision is expected to help rebuild the Axie Infinity brand, and has so far been met with a positive reaction. In the last month, Axie Infinity\u2019s native token, AXS, has increased in value by 15.88%, and experts believe that Axie Infinity could begin to attract new players in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, Axie Infinity released a number of features, including a new evolution for players to enjoy. However, given that the game still has a long way to go, Everlodge could be a more profitable investment.\n\nEverlodge Introduces Fractionalized Holiday Home Investments\n\nAs Ethereum investors begin to diversify, more are buying Everlodge as the project continues to gain momentum. In Q4, the project sold out 7 presale stages, and its native token, $ELDG, is now selling at $0.027 per token.\n\nEverlodge is the world\u2019s first decentralized marketplace for holiday homes. Here, users can buy, sell, and invest in some of the world\u2019s most beautiful and profitable travel real estate. The Everlodge marketplace promises to connect travel property buyers and sellers while removing the market\u2019s barriers to entry.\n\nAfter signing up and creating their account, investors will be able to look through the Everlodge marketplace for properties on sale. They can then buy an NFT fraction that represents equity in the property. The NFTs smart contract will contain all transactional data, including the deed to the property.\n\nOnce an investor purchases equity in a property, they will generate a monthly income from it. This income will range based on how much the property makes, in addition to how much equity an investor owns. The higher their equity, the more they\u2019ll earn.\n\nThis unique ecosystem promises to also offer a launchpad for property developers, free stays for ELDG token holders, and more.\n\nVisit Everlodge Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "Legendary trader Peter Brandt recently devoted time to school Ethereum (ETH) proponents on charting skills as he makes an effort to water down the coin\u2019s strides.\n\nTaking to his official account on X, Peter Brandt said what many call the Ascending Triangle in Ethereum\u2019s price is technically incorrect. Using his charting experience, Peter Brandt pointed out reasons why he believes the pattern in Ethereum is not an ascending triangle.\n\nAn ascending Triangle is a bullish chart formation that generally depicts an uptrend that is imminent in consonance with rising volume. Whenever the price breaks about the upper horizontal line, the asset may continue its ascent unless bigger market forces impact the trend.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nPeter Brandt\u2019s Thesis\n\nAccording to the trader, the correct starting point for the Ethereum pattern was August 2022 and not April 2022 when the coin touched a local high. In reality, Peter Brandt labeled the April 2022 price action as one that is part of a preceding bear trend.\n\n1/\n\nInsight into charting\n\nMany youngstas in noobersville have insisted that the pattern in $ETH is an ascending triangle\n\nIt is not so.\n\nThe correct starting point for this pattern was Aug 2022 high, NOT Apr 2022 high. Apr '22 price action was part of preceding bear trend pic.twitter.com/yFvPj2ul3n \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 28, 2023\n\nLooking at the all-time Ethereum chart, this latter statement is correct as the $3,522.36 price high gained in April 2022 comes as the coin receded from the All-Time High (ATH) of $4,891.70 in November 2021.\n\nPeter Brandt clarified that Ascending Triangles have horizontal upper boundaries as defined earlier. When zoomed out, the April 2023 high is $120 higher than the August 2022 that many people failed to acknowledge as the starting point in the ascending triangle pattern plot.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNonetheless, Brandt acknowledged that this charting mode matters a little as the \u201cmeasuring implications for determining targets are roughly the same for an asc tri and running wedge.\u201d\n\nHe concluded by noting that in the end \u201cbeauty can be in the eye of the beholder,\u201d underscoring how different traders can interpret data differently.\n\nThe Unending Ethereum Criticism\n\nPeter Brandt has made headlines on more than one occasion for calling out Ethereum as an asset that is destined to fall. Notably, Peter Brandt acknowledged recently that he shorted ETH as he believed it could fall below the $1000 price level, and likely to $650.\n\nAs part of his bearish projections on Ethereum, the legendary trader is convinced the second-largest digital currency may not be a listed asset in the next 10 years, owing to its high gas fees."

        "content": "External - Press Release\n\nBy: ICL PR \u2022 Loading...\n\nExternal PR\n\nNew York, New York, December 28th, 2023, Chainwire\n\nPrimex Finance, a non-custodial protocol for margin trading on decentralized exchanges, is delighted to announce its deployment on Ethereum. In addition to its newest deployment, Primex has been available in the Polygon PoS and Arbitrum One networks. Besides advancing its multichain initiatives, the protocol\u2019s deployment on Ethereum expands its target audience, offers more asset choices for users, and leverages the decentralization and security of a long-standing and established blockchain.\n\nAs a non-custodial protocol compatible with the EVM, Primex facilitates spot margin trading within its ecosystem. Instead of competing with DEXs, Primex works on top of them, with the ultimate goal of unifying liquidity in the decentralized finance market. On the one hand, traders can take advantage of CEX-like tooling and interfaces and amplify their positions by borrowing assets from Credit Buckets, specialized liquidity pools designed exclusively for leveraged operations. In exchange for supplying liquidity to Buckets, lenders can earn high lending APYs and diversify their loan portfolio based on their risk appetite.\n\nTrade execution remains completely decentralized within the Primex ecosystem. The protocol doesn\u2019t rely on central limit order books (CLOBs) or other centralized backends to achieve this goal. Instead, a network of community-run keeper bots executes automated trades like limit, take profit, and stop-loss orders and liquidates traders\u2019 positions that fall below the maintenance margin. Primex\u2019s future plans include extending the protocol\u2019s functionalities and use cases with further leveraged operations across DeFi protocols beyond non-custodial margin trading.\n\n\u201cWith Primex being live on Ethereum, the protocol can now reach users in the largest DeFi market. This provides an excellent opportunity for Primex to grow and expand its audience. This deployment offers more options and flexibility for users, and they can also tap into the blockchain\u2019s security and decentralization. Considering Ethereum\u2019s liquidity, gas fees and block time, it may be a better fit for traders and lenders with larger positions and deposit sizes,\u201d said Dmitry Tolok, Primex\u2019s co-founder.\n\nPrimex\u2019s deployment on Ethereum represents a new stage in the project\u2019s Liquidity Mining Program. With new Credit Buckets accumulating liquidity and launching in the protocol, Primex invites users to join the program and support the ecosystem while earning rewards based on their roles and activities. More opportunities can be realized by participating in the Referral Program, which offers a portion of generated protocol revenue to referrers and Early Primex NFTs to referees.\n\nAbout Primex Finance\n\nFounded in 2021, Primex Finance is a decentralized protocol for spot margin trading on DEXs. It connects lenders with traders, enabling traders to utilize lender liquidity for leveraged trading on popular DEXs. Primex offers traders familiar CEX-like trading interfaces and tools to enhance flexibility for their trading strategies. In October 2023, the protocol launched its long-awaited mainnet Beta release on Polygon, representing a significant milestone in its roadmap. Not long after, Primex deployed on Arbitrum and became a multichain protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Expert predictions hint at a stunning 74% price surge for THORChain (RUNE) in 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH) saw a slight uptick after Vitalik Buterin moved 500 ETH to Coinbase. Meanwhile, an emerging crypto coin has attracted the attention of investors after raising $950,000 in its presale. On the other hand, THORChain (RUNE) has forged a new partnership to enable BTC and ETH lending.\n\nRead on as we dive deep into the latest developments around ETH and RUNE and explore why the new meme coin is the best crypto to invest in!\n\nEthereum Co-founder Moves 500 ETH to Coinbase\n\nOn December 19, 2023, the cryptocurrency community was abuzz with discussions surrounding a significant event involving Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum.\n\nEtherscan data revealed a massive transfer of 500 ETH by Buterin to Coinbase, triggering speculations about a potential sale of ETH holdings. The nature of such transfers often leaves room for uncertainty \u2013 when funds are moved to an unknown address, it\u2019s unclear if a sale occurred.\n\nHowever, the transfer to a prominent exchange like Coinbase increases the likelihood of a sale, though it remains inconclusive. Some speculate that Buterin might be leveraging a centralized exchange to earn annual percentage yields on his ETH, with the flexibility to withdraw at his intention.\n\nFollowing this revelation, the price of Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, experienced a noteworthy surge. The market responded positively to the news, leading to an increase in ETH\u2019s price from $2,139.72 on December 19 to $2,280.91 on December 27. So, is ETH the best crypto to buy now?\n\nEthereum\u2019s future appears promising, according to expert predictions. It is anticipated that ETH will surpass the $3,900 mark, reaching $3,933.35 in 2024. This optimistic outlook is attributed to the anticipation of an upcoming bull run and the potential approval of an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nConversely, bearish forecasts caution that ETH\u2019s price might remain below $3,277.56 in 2024 if the market sentiment turns bearish.\n\nRebel Satoshi Can Surpass Top Altcoins With 150% Profit Potential\n\nTop altcoins have dominated the market for quite some time now. However, a new contender is here to challenge the dominance of top crypto coins with a rebellious approach, and it\u2019s called Rebel Satoshi (RBLZ).\n\nWhile $RBLZ, the native token of Rebel Satoshi, does offer remarkable growth prospects, it goes beyond financial gains, calls for a rebellion against the status quo, and aims to promote decentralization. Furthermore, Rebel Satoshi focuses on building a strong community of rebels to achieve its audacious goals, including $100 million in market capitalization.\n\nRebel Satoshi has garnered immense appraisal for its ongoing presale after raising a staggering $950,000 in funding by selling over 79% of its presale supply. This unprecedented presale performance has put $RBLZ among altcoins to watch for exponential growth in 2024.\n\nAfter selling its Early Bird Round in just three weeks at $0.010 per $RBLZ, Rebel Satoshi soared by 100% to reach $0.02 per $RBLZ in the ongoing Citizens Round 3. It implies that investors can buy $RBLZ tokens at $0.02 using Bitcoin and 50 other cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, market analysts predict $RBLZ will reach $0.025 during its official listing, bringing a stunning 150% ROI for early investors!\n\nTHORChain Joins Hands With Shapeshift to Enable BTC and ETH Lending\n\nOn December 18, 2023, Shapeshift, a prominent crypto-swapping platform, made a groundbreaking announcement on X regarding THORChain. Shapeshift revealed that it has expanded its services to include THORChain lending against both Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nThe platform outlined a unique lending process wherein, upon opening a new loan, the collateral provided undergoes a swap to RUNE. The innovative approach ensures that the difference between the loan value and the collateral value is burned, eliminating the need for liquidations or interest.\n\nThe price of THORChain\u2019s native token, RUNE, experienced a notable increase following the announcement by Shapeshift. The market positively responded to the news, witnessing a rise of 9.7% in RUNE\u2019s price from $5.1406 on December 18 to $5.6434 on December 27.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, experts predict a promising future for THORChain. The RUNE price is anticipated to surge by 74%, reaching $9.78 in 2024. This optimistic outlook is attributed to THORChain\u2019s increasing adoption and the widespread anticipation of an upcoming bull run.\n\nHowever, cautious forecasts suggest that the RUNE price may stay below $8.40 in 2024 if the market sentiments turn bearish.For the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram"

However, this vision began to fade in 2017 with the turn towards the \u201cfinancialization\u201d of the protocol, Buterin states.\n\nDecentralization, open participation, resistance to censorship, and trustworthy neutrality are among the \u201ccypherpunk\u201d ideals Buterin wants to see in the future of Ethereum. He emphasized that rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and second-generation privacy solutions that have become more common on the network, tenets that support the core cypherpunk values.\n\nButerin also said he was impressed by some of the developments created to solve the industry\u2019s biggest problems. He called decentralized exchanges (DEX) that provide improved tools for protection positive industry developments, mentioning Cowswap, Flashbots Protect, and MEV Blocker that helped limit \u201csandwich attacks\u201d on Ethereum users.\n\n\u201cEthereum is a dark forest where on-chain traders are constantly vulnerable to getting exploited [\u2026] This is also true in other ways: smart contracts regularly get hacked, users\u2019 wallets regularly get hacked, centralized exchanges fail even more spectacularly, etc.\u201d Vitalik Buterin\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin\u2019s new proposal would cut Ethereum\u2019s security\n\nSome X users were encouraged by Vitalik\u2019s plans, especially regarding cryptocurrency payments for retail clients. One of the users noted that practically no attention has been paid to this issue.\n\nThank you for highlighting consumer crypto payments. It does feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about it every day.\n\n\n\nThe good news is we\u2019re also building it, and it works great https://t.co/GRcaZzJidF \u2014 jacopo (@jj_ranalli) December 29, 2023\n\nAnother user compared Vitalik\u2019s statement with the election campaign of former U.S. President Donald Trump and proposed creating a new token with the ticker MEGA (Make Ethereum Great Again) in support of Ethereum.\n\nInfluencer Ignas from DeFi Research posted a photo of Buterin in front of a poster with Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron network, joking that the place of the most decentralized ecosystem has already been taken.\n\n\"Background: the humble Tron founder and decentralization pioneer Justin Sun bravely leading forth the coolest and most decentralized crypto ecosystem in the global world.\" pic.twitter.com/cKfTWXdmu7 \u2014 Ignas | DeFi Research (@DefiIgnas) December 28, 2023\n\nAccording to Buterin, \u201cthe early vision of \u2018web3\u2019 [\u2026] is a different way of thinking about what Ethereum is: [\u2026] a set of technologies that could together form the base layer of a more open internet stack.\u201d\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin pitches 3 pathways to simplify Ethereum\u2019s PoS model\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "zkSync has exceeded Ethereum in terms of transaction volume in the last 30 days.\n\nThe demand for zkSync has risen consistently since its launch in February.\n\nLayer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum zkSync has overtaken its parent network in transaction volume over the past month, data from L2BEAT revealed.\n\nAccording to the data provider, zkSync has processed a staggering 35 million transactions, compared to Ethereum\u2019s 34 million in the past 30 days.\n\nIn the last seven days, zkSync has recorded a 24% uptick in the number of average daily transactions it can process per second. At press time, this was 13.79 transactions.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum was five places behind with an average transaction per second (TPS) count of 13.72.\n\nThe surge in transaction volume on zkSync is linked to the introduction of inscriptions on the chain and across various Ethereum Virtual Machine-enabled (EVM) networks.\n\nData from a Dune Analytics dashboard prepared by analyst Hildoby showed that when inscriptions were first introduced to zkSync on 16th December, the scaling solution recorded its highest monthly transaction surge.\n\nFor context, on that day, inscriptions-based transactions constituted 87% of the 5.3 million total transactions completed on zkSync. Also, on the same day, its TPS climbed to a high of 62.07.\n\nData from L2Beat showed that this was zkSync\u2019s highest observed TPS averaged over a single-day period.\n\nzkSync in 2023\n\nSince its launch in February, zkSync has steadily grown in user activity. According to data from Token Terminal, its monthly count of active users has since risen by a whopping 3,000,000 %.\n\nIn its first month, the network\u2019s user count totaled 69. With two days left till the end of December, it has recorded a user count of 2.7 million this month.\n\nDecember\u2019s figure already stands at a 12% increase from the 2.4 million active users zkSync registered in November.\n\nAs user activity grew, network fees and protocol revenue rallied as well. However, by May, monthly fees and revenue peaked at $10.2 million and have since trended downward.\n\nSo far this month, zkSync\u2019s fees and revenue are $7 million each, seeing a 42% rise in the last 30 days.\n\nRegarding network total value locked (TVL), zkSync\u2019s TVL was $160.24 million, according to data from DefiLlama. This initiated an uptick on 20th November and has since increased by 20%."

Ethereum remained a slugger for quite some time but decided to rally a week ago as Bitcoin slipped into consolidation.\n\nSince then, many Ethereum-related altcoins have pumped. The tokens that pumped initially were the newly launched altcoins like PYTH, PENDLE, and TIA, but slowly, older altcoins like UNI, ETC, AAVE are starting to play catch-up.\n\nCrypto Twitter, more commonly known as CT, addresses this trading strategy as \u201cETH-beta,\u201d which relates to altcoins that are associated with ETH.\n\nAlso read: \u201cBitcoin is so back\u201d says Messari, as Inscriptions account for 21% of total fees in 2023\n\nAAVE holders in for a treat\n\nAave price slipped below the $116 and $107 support levels on May 9, 2022. Since then, multiple attempts have been made to push the altcoin higher, but all were in vain. AAVE largely remained unfazed when Bitcoin price dropped on December 28, so the ongoing struggle to flip $116 into a support floor likely has legs.\n\nA risky bet would be to accumulate AAVE at $107 should there be an intraday dip. This buying activity would be with the expectation that Aave price flips the aforementioned key hurdle.\n\nIn total, the rally from $116 to $162 would constitute a 40% gain.\n\nAAVE/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Aave price breaks the $107 support level and flips it into a resistance level, it would be the first sign of bullish failure. In such a case, if AAVE breached the $95 support level, it would create a lower low and invalidate the optimistic outlook detailed above.\n\nThis development could also see Aave price crash 20% to collect the liquidity resting below the October 27 swing low at $75.\n\nRead more: XRP price is coming up on an important directional breakout as Ripple fills multi-year triangle"

        "content": "BTC\u2019s and ETH\u2019s price action this year was one of the best of the century.\n\nBTC displayed weakness, suggesting a decline below $43,000 while ETH may move toward $2,500.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s [BTC] and Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] performances in 2023 would go down as one of the best-ever in the century, a post by Santiment disclosed. At press time, BTC had been able to reclaim $43,000. ETH, on the other end, skyrocketed and changed hands at $2,380.\n\nThe crypto analysis tool, in its post, also mentioned that ETH and BTC possess the ability to reach their highest values before the year ends.\n\n\ud83e\udd73\ud83d\udcca 2023 is going down in the books as one of the best performing years of the century, accounting for multiple major sectors. #Bitcoin and #Ethereum are still within reach of breaking 1.5+ year highs, which were just established 3 weeks ago. https://t.co/JxbW5vU5Iy pic.twitter.com/aLSGX5U2Vv \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 27, 2023\n\nAfter the glimmer, comes the party\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the crypto market was struggling to recover from the FTX collapse that plunged prices. During that time, BTC\u2019s value was less than $17,000 while ETH traded a little above $1,200.\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum was fueled by different reasons.\n\nBut around the first quarter (Q1), the major reason was the collapse of some top traditional institutions in the U.S. The crash of the banks at that time triggered distrust in the institutions.\n\nIn turn, the crypto market led by Ethereum and Bitcoin gained from the liquidity withdrawn as it also affected prices in a good way.\n\nWhile there were other reasons for the continuous price hike, the notable influence that has kept both coins on the green side is the optimism around a potential spot ETF. For most of the year, several firms have applied for either an Ethereum or Bitcoin ETF. In a few cases, some firms applied for both.\n\nThese applications, despite being delayed by the U.S. SEC influenced investment inflows. On many occasions, AMBCrypto disclosed hikes in money flowing into investment products connected to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe inflows indicated that several institutions were confident in the short and long-term performance of the cryptocurrencies. So, it was not surprising that BTC put a 159% Year-To-Date (YTD) increase.\n\nETH also followed by climbing by 98%. Going into the last few days, there are predictions that the coins may finish the year even better.\n\nBulls and bears to hustle for the grand prize\n\nFor Bitcoin, the daily chart showed that there was strong support at $42,279. However, the support at the level was not a confirmation of a bullish trend.\n\nAMBCrypto evaluated the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) which was negative.\n\nThe negative MACD indicated increasing downward momentum. Further, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) confirmed the bias as the reading fell to 54.52. If this trend continues, Bitcoin might end the year below $43,000.\n\nHowever, the chart above also shows the On Balance Volume (OBV) which was rising. The rising OBV reflects positive volume pressure which could lead to higher prices.\n\nIf buying pressure increases just before the year ends, BTC might hit $45,000. If not, a downward move below $43,000 could be its next target.\n\nMeanwhile, the ETH/USD 4-hour chart mirrored a bullish structure. On the 27th of December, ETH had surpassed the $2,290 resistance. But the coin price faced a swift rejection after it hit $2,415, suggesting that there was a cluster of accumulation at the level.\n\nThough volatility increased, the upper band of the Bollinger Bands (BB) hit the ETH price. This suggests that the altcoin was overbought and the price may retrace further. But on looking at the Directional Movement Index (DMI), the story was different.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nAt press time, the +DMI (green) was 33.92 while the -DMI (red) was 16.35. This position implied that ETH\u2019s bullish tendencies remained pressure.\n\nShould the Average Directional Index (ADX), colored yellow, remain above 25 while the +DMI tops the -DMI, then ETH may retest $2,415 or jump to $2,500 before the year closes."

        "content": "Ether has outperformed Bitcoin this week. (Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\nEther, the native token of the Ethereum network, has rallied over 6% in the past 24 hours. The second-largest digital asset by market capitalisation has outperformed bitcoin in the past week.\n\nEther (ETH-USD) is now changing hands for $2,388, (\u00a31,865) posting an 8% rally in the past week. Analysts anticipate positive price action from the digital asset in 2024. Forecasts are based upon the significant technological strides made by the Ethereum Foundation over the past year.\n\nAccording to a recent ETC Group report, several elements could contribute to ether outperforming bitcoin in 2024. The report points to ether's transition to a deflationary model, initiated by the Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP-1559 in August 2021. This mechanism reduces the overall supply of ether.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nAlso, yields from ETH staking offer further attraction for investors. These dynamics collectively indicate a potential uptick in ether\u2019s value in the forthcoming year. Ethereum (ETH) staking involves locking up a certain amount of ether to support the Ethereum network and validate transactions, earning 'stakers' additional ether as a reward for their contribution to network security. These 'stakers' are essentially helping to secure the blockchain by participating in the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nBitcoin retraces recent gains\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) has traded flat, hovering around the $43,000 mark over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe largest digital asset by market capitalisation has dropped as much as 1.3% in the past week to now change hands for $43,100.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin is up \u2014 and the zealots are back\n\nAnalysts anticipate the approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US within weeks. A spot bitcoin ETF is a financial product that investors hope will open the gateway for mainstream capital to flood the crypto market.\n\nThe possible approval of a spot bitcoin ETF will be made by the Securities Exchange Commission, SEC. Analysts argue that approval by the US regulatory body could lend credibility to the digital asset.\n\nStory continues\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF could also trigger increased institutional adoption of the digital asset, and see significant investments from pension and mutual funds, potentially channeling billions into the cryptocurrency market with an approved spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nWatch: UK faces challenges in nurturing tech startups like OpenAI | The Crypto Mile\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

Specifically, the 30-day volatility (DVOL) has climbed by an impressive 70% since April.\n\nThe Christmas overlaid with the annual shift effect caused significant IV declines across all major terms, especially for short-term options expiring on the last few trading days of the year.\n\nBitcoin has risen nearly threefold throughout the year, but not once has IV crossed 70%.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/94OiP0noBR \u2014 Greeks.live (@GreeksLive) December 26, 2023\n\nBitcoin has often been the main focus during cryptocurrency surges. However, Ethereum\u2019s recent growth is gaining traction. While it might not be as rapid as Bitcoin\u2019s rise, Ethereum is steadily making its mark.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024 \u2013 Predicts Crypto Expert Lark Davis\n\nThe Potential is Huge\u2026 But What\u2019s Missing?\n\nMarket experts, though, have an optimistic view of Ethereum as we head into 2024. Industry expert Michael van de Poppe believes there\u2019s a historical trend at play. He suggests that just before Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving event (a time when Bitcoin mining rewards are halved), Bitcoin\u2019s dominance typically peaks. This often leads to a favorable environment for alternative cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.\n\nThe #Bitcoin dominance is likely peaking pre-Bitcoin halving.\n\n\n\nThat means that Q1 is going to give a great return for investments in the $ETH ecosystem.\n\n\n\nI'm positioned and ready. pic.twitter.com/Iqlxkojz4w \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 22, 2023\n\nDespite the positive trends, data from Skew indicates that institutional traders haven\u2019t fully joined the rally. The term \u201cFOMO\u201d (Fear of Missing Out) is often used in finance to describe the fear of missing a profitable opportunity. Currently, it seems many institutional traders are exercising caution.\n\nA Deep Dive Into Technical Insights\n\nBreaking down the recent price movements, Ethereum reached $2,433, surpassing a key level at $2,334. This price point is significant as it aligns with a bullish pattern known as the inverse head and shoulders. Unlike the traditional head and shoulders pattern which signals a potential drop, the inverse version suggests an upward shift. If Ethereum continues on this path, it could potentially reach $2,551, marking a growth of 9.3%.\n\nAnalyzing shorter time frames, Ethereum\u2019s 8-hour chart supports the bullish sentiment, indicating further potential growth. Additionally, a report from Coinpedia suggests Ethereum might see another 5% increase, hinting at a potential surge towards $3,000.\n\nRead More: SEC Postpones Ruling on Ethereum ETFs, Opens Door for Public Input\n\nAs 2024 approaches, the cryptocurrency community is keenly observing Ethereum\u2019s trajectory."

        "title": "Nifty News: Trump cashing out NFT earnings, Ordinals debate goes to 'shit' and more - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Trump starts shifting ETH earned from his NFTs\n\nFormer United States President Donald Trump appears to be cashing out a great deal of Ether (ETH) he made through selling his NFTs \u2014 with his affiliated wallet transferring 1,075 Ether (ETH) into Coinbase since Dec. 8.\n\nTrump made the ETH from his NFT collections, which recently included his infamous mugshot that was captured when he surrendered himself to authorities in Georgia in August.\n\nAccording to the blockchain intelligence platform Arkham, the Trump-linked wallet has moved 1,075 ETH, worth about $2.4 million, to Coinbase over 13 transactions since Dec. 8. Most withdrawals came in batches of 100, 125 and 200 ETH.\n\nLooks like Donald Trump is selling his ETH.\n\n\n\n3 weeks ago he started sending ETH to Coinbase after months of accumulating Trump NFT royalties. His peak balance was $4 million.\n\n\n\nBased on the deposits, so far he's sold 1,075 ETH for $2.4 million. pic.twitter.com/JZzA3cS2je \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) December 27, 2023\n\nTrump\u2019s ETH balance had been steadily increasing since October, reaching a peak of $4 million before the selling spree began.\n\nYears ago, Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as \u201cfake\u201d and \u201ca disaster waiting to happen\u201d in August 2021 when he defended the United States dollar as a key to the country\u2019s economic success.\n\nHe\u2019s running for president again in the upcoming 2024 election but his campaign was hit with a recent roadblock when Colorado\u2019s Supreme Court removed him from the state\u2019s ballot.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals argument turns to \"shit\" (and farts)\n\nBitcoin Ordinals commentators have found a new way to describe the ever-evolving Ordinals debate \u2014 and this time, it\u2019s pretty gross.\n\nSince Ordinals launched in January, Bitcoin supporters and critics have been in fierce debate over whether it adds value to Bitcoin\u2019s network or is simply spam.\n\nTomer Strolight, editor-in-chief at Bitcoin financial services firm Swan, described the conflict using a rather graphic analogy on X:\n\n\u201cA guy shits in the street. It stinks. He encourages others to shit in public, clogging the streets w/ shit. He says it brings new people to the city because they're degenerates who like it. 'It's ok,' he says. 'They pay to shit.' But shit everywhere has made everything cost more.\u201d\n\nAnother Bitcoiner, \u201cGregZaj1\u201d said Ordinals artists were akin to people paying admission to \u201cstart shitting in the pool.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine someone builds a swimming pool for his community. You have to pay to enjoy the privilege of using the pool, and it's a market-based price with limited pool capacity. One day, a bunch of men dressed as wizards come, pay their entrance fee, and start shitting in the pool.\u201d\n\nThe comment is likely in reference to Taproot Wizards \u2014 a digital art collection inscribed by Bitcoin Ordinals \u2014 which has played a major role in driving Ordinals adoption in 2023.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing funnier to me that there\u2019s legit bitcoiners out there right now suffering every day because they feel like Bitcoin has become full of farts and they\u2019re simply powerless to stop it,\u201d said Bitcoin developer Eric Wall, a co-founder of Taproot Wizards in a Dec. 28 post on X.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing funnier to me that there\u2019s legit bitcoiners out there right now suffering every day because they feel like Bitcoin has become full of farts and they\u2019re simply powerless to stop it pic.twitter.com/9otyh8tGjX \u2014 Eric Wall | BIP-2023-50428 (@ercwl) December 28, 2023\n\nThe Ordinals craze is still causing heated debate in the cryptocurrency community.\n\nOrdinals critics such as OCEAN Mining\u2019s Luke Dashjr has continued to argue that Ordinals inscriptions are \u201cspam\u201d and that they\u2019re not only clogging up the Bitcoin mempool, but causing a legitimate security threat to Bitcoin Core.\n\nDashjr also played a role in Ordinals being added to the United States National Vulnerability Database \u2014 a repository of cybersecurity risks managed by the U.S. government.\n\nOn the other hand, Ordinals fans continue to argue that it brings legitimate economic traffic to Bitcoin and incentivizes miners to stick around for higher fee rewards.\n\nOrdinals fanatic pays $7K to fulfill Elon Musk\u2019s NFT request\n\nAn unknown Ordinals pundit has followed through on a challenge by Elon Musk to encode a video clip on a blockchain, paying an eye-watering $7,223 to do so.\n\nThe challenge from Musk came after \u201cDogeDesigner\u201d posted a video on X with the caption \u201cDoes anyone still remember NFTs?\u201d to which another X user quipped with, \u201cWeb links to data you don\u2019t own.\u201d\n\nThe video, which lasts 1:18 minutes in length, showcases a 3D rotating diorama with gold-plated text stating \u201ccomputers never sleeps\u201d and \u201cHODL\u201d on different plates.\n\nThat opened the floor to Musk, who said: \u201cYeah, at least encode the jpeg on the blockchain!\u201d\n\nYeah, at least encode the jpeg on the blockchain! \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 27, 2023\n\nAbout 15 hours later, inscription number 51,887,020, was added to Bitcoin at block 823,142, featuring the video in MP4 format.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t cheap either, costing the inscriber 16.9 million sats, or $7,223, according to Ordinals developer Leonidas.\n\nThe Tesla CEO recently slammed NFTs on a podcast with Joe Rogan in October, arguing that JPEGs should at least be encoded on blockchains. In doing so, he indirectly argued the case for Ordinals, which is encoded in Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\n\u201cIf the company housing the image goes out of business, you don\u2019t have the image anymore,\u201d Musk explained.\n\nEthereum NFT dominance wanes after recent Ordinals and Solana surge\n\nEthereum dominance in the nonfungible token (NFT) market has all but \u201ccompletely disappeared\u201d amid a surge in NFT activity Ordinals and Solana in recent months, according to a market commentato\n\nBitcoin has tallied $796.7 million in Ordinals sales NFT volumes this month so far \u2014 crushing Ethereum, which only recorded $319.7 million over the same timeframe. Even Solana has beaten Ethereum with $334.2 million in volume, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\n\u201cEthereum NFT dominance has completely disappeared this year,\u201d explained Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at cryptocurrency venture fund Dragonfly.\n\n\u201cReally striking to see laid out like this. Goes to show how little you can take for granted in this industry,\u201d Qureshi added.\n\nOrdinals trading volumes on Bitcoin since June. Source: CryptoSlam.\n\nThe recent figures starkly contrast the February to April period this year, when Bitcoin Ordinals was still relatively new.\n\nEthereum tallied nearly $2 billion in NFT trading volume during the period compared to $137.3 million on Ordinals.\n\nRelated: Are NFT markets in a death spiral or ready for a resurgence?\n\nHowever, Bitcoin Ordinals have had a roller coaster year. Ordinals volumes rose to $196 million in May but fell to as low as $11.9 million in August. The two months following were also low, with volumes below $20 million.\n\nOther Nifty News\n\nAll Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFTs stolen from the peer-to-peer trading platform NFT Trader have been returned after a bounty payment. NFTs worth nearly $3 million were stolen in the hack on Dec. 16. As per public messages, the attacker attributed the original exploit to another user. \u201cI came here to pick up residual garbage,\u201d they wrote, requesting ransom payments to return the NFTs.\n\nCoinbase-powered blockchain Base announced a partnership with the blockchain music platform Sound.xyz on Dec. 19, which now allows artists to mint music via the Base ecosystem.

        "title": "Can This Red-Hot Crypto Outperform Bitcoin Again in 2024? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "One of the standout performers in the crypto market this year has been Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), which is up almost 1,000% in 2023. On the strength of its recent performance, Solana has become the fifth-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world, and some analysts are even predicting that it could soon surpass Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) in terms of market cap.\n\nWhat's all the more remarkable is how Solana's performance this year compares to that of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which has historically served as the benchmark for the overall crypto market. While Solana is up almost 1,000% for the year, Bitcoin is up \"just\" 160%. That's despite all the hoopla surrounding the possible new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund and the Bitcoin halving next year, which will slow the crypto's supply growth. So the obvious question becomes: Can Solana outperform Bitcoin again in 2024?\n\nReasons for Solana's outperformance\n\nTo answer that question, it's important to understand the key factors behind Solana's meteoric rise in 2023. In the early part of the year, investors embraced the narrative that Solana had finally distanced itself from the meltdown of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX (CRYPTO: FTT). The former chief executive officer of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, had been a major backer of Solana, and the risk of FTX contagion was seen as a real threat at the end of 2022.\n\nAs this perceived risk subsided, it was only natural that the price of Solana eventually retraced its way back from $10 to a level around $40, which is where it was trading before the FTX collapse.\n\nAround this time, institutional investors, not just retail investors, began to buy into the narrative around a Solana recovery. They increasingly began to see Solana as a viable alternative to Ethereum, and that apparently led to a new influx of institutional investor money into Solana. CoinShares, which tracks institutional flows into and out of various cryptocurrencies, has documented a consistent pattern of institutional money leaving Ethereum and moving into Solana.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far, so good, right? Both retail and institutional investors seemed to be aligned on Solana as a viable competitor to Ethereum.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBut over the past month, the narrative around Solana seems to have taken another, completely unexpected turn, and that's why I'm concerned that Solana might be overheating. This new, more speculative phase has corresponded with the rise of Solana meme coins. The obvious example is Bonk (CRYPTO: BONK), which has gone absolutely wild this year. It's now up almost 10,000% year to date.\n\nThe spectacular success of Bonk has led to the launch of even sillier meme coins, including ones that feature dogs, dragons, and, yes, melons. If this meme coin mania continues, it will only lead to more volatility for Solana, which is at risk of becoming the blockchain of choice for crypto speculators. As a result, all the hard work that has gone into making Solana a viable competitor to Ethereum could be undone by the get-rich-quick crypto crowd.\n\nQuestion marks for Solana\n\nThere are also several question marks surrounding Solana in areas where it has traditionally been very strong, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). At the beginning of 2023, a number of popular NFT collections left Solana for other blockchains, due to the perceived risk of FTX contagion. At the same time, NFTs known as Ordinals took off on Bitcoin, to the point where NFT sales volume on Bitcoin is now higher than on Solana. Before 2023, this would have been unthinkable.\n\nThere's also the matter of regulatory risk. In June, the Securities and Exchange Commission seemed to conclude that Solana was an \"unregistered security.\" When the SEC filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), it specifically mentioned Solana as one of several unregistered securities trading on the Coinbase platform. This is a tricky issue to parse because the SEC did not bring any formal enforcement action against Solana. But still, this is exactly the sort of regulatory issue that could torpedo a Solana rally in 2024.\n\nCan Solana keep it up in 2024?\n\nCertainly, there's a lot to like about Solana. I've been banging the drum for Solana ever since the collapse of FTX. I've always viewed Solana as a viable alternative to Ethereum, and I've always thought the valuations of the two cryptos should be much narrower than they are today.\n\nBut the new speculative frenzy around Solana has me very concerned. Increasingly, it suggests that Solana's performance won't be sustainable in 2024. Solana has simply gone up too far, too fast. Yes, Solana may continue to outperform Ethereum next year. But it's looking increasingly unlikely that it will also outperform Bitcoin.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Solana right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Solana, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Solana wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Shows Signs of Recovery; Cardano (ADA) & InQubeta (QUBE) Drive Altcoin Surge - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) is showcasing resilience, exhibiting signs of a potential recovery. Concurrently, two top altcoins, Cardano (ADA) and InQubeta (QUBE), drive a notable surge in the altcoin market.\n\nAs Ethereum charts a path of revival, the spotlight on Cardano\u2019s remarkable growth sets the stage for what promises to be an intriguing narrative. Yet, it is the transformative potential of InQubeta that steals the show, emerging as a promising altcoin poised for significance in 2024.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Network Activity and Bullish Outlook\n\nRecent data presented by Martinez reveals that new Ethereum addresses have been rising. This surge in network activity suggests a renewed interest in accumulating Ethereum, hinting at a potential uptick in the asset\u2019s price. Despite some FUD circulating within the Ethereum community, particularly from figures like Peter Brandt, the growing network activity provides optimism for ETH\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\nExamining the charts, the number of new addresses entering the Ethereum network has reached its highest level since October 16. This surge aligns with efforts from ETH bulls to revitalize the coin\u2019s price after weeks of range-bound motion. As Ethereum retests its breakout zone, the network\u2019s increasing activity could pave the way for a resumption of the coin\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\nCardano (ADA) & InQubeta (QUBE) Drive Altcoin Surge\n\nIn the vast realm of the best altcoins, two notable players, Cardano (ADA) and InQubeta (QUBE), are at the forefront of driving a surge in the market. While Cardano boasts a remarkable 150% growth in the past three months, the spotlight is on InQubeta, positioning itself as one of the best altcoins to buy for 2024.\n\nCardano (ADA): A Proof-of-Stake Powerhouse\n\nCardano (ADA) has quietly achieved a remarkable 150% growth in the past three months. Cardano stands out as a compelling altcoin as a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nThe surge experienced by Cardano is attributed to growing demand, increased institutional acceptance, and an overall improvement in market sentiment. Positioned as one of the best cryptos to invest in, Cardano offers enormous upside potential while maintaining a reasonably priced entry point.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): Transforming AI Funding\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) has gained the attention of many heavyweight investors by achieving over 150% growth in its presale. This innovative project aims to revolutionize the AI market, which is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2030. Leveraging blockchain technology, InQubeta seeks to reshape the fundraising landscape for AI startups, providing investment opportunities through trending NFTs and with the use of its native token, QUBE.\n\nThe token\u2019s impressive journey, from a humble $0.007 during beta to its current stage at $0.01925, underscores the enthusiasm surrounding InQubeta. As the first crowdfunding crypto for beginners and AI startups, it offers investors a chance to participate in the rapidly growing AI market through NFT fractionalization.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s mission is to make the AI market accessible to a broader investor base, allowing startups to secure capital through crypto. With experts predicting a potential 55x increase after launch, InQubeta (QUBE) emerges as one of the best altcoins to invest in, offering growth potential and the opportunity to reshape the future of AI funding.\n\nConclusion: A Diverse Altcoin Landscape\n\nIn the world of the best alt coins, Ethereum\u2019s signs of recovery set a positive tone for the market. Cardano\u2019s impressive growth complements the altcoin surge. However, InQubeta (QUBE) took an extra leap, standing out as a promising altcoin with transformative potential in AI funding.\n\nTo explore these opportunities further, consider visiting InQubeta\u2019s website and joining the vibrant community on Twitter. As the altcoin landscape evolves, stay informed and embrace its diversity.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "content": "The search volume for Solana has surpassed Ethereum on Google for the first time following the recent spike in SOL price and its ecosystem activity.\n\nThroughout the year, Ethereum was in the lead against Solana on Google search, but the recently changed market dynamics have pushed users\u2019 interest in Solana to a higher position\n\nThe increase in Solana search interest has been recorded in the past two weeks, according to Google Trends data.\n\nSolana & Ethereum Search Interest \u2013 Google Trends\n\nSolana got a search interest score of 100 from December 24 to December 30, which helped it surpass the Ethereum search dominance with a sudden spike. The score of 100 in search interest represents peak popularity for the term.\n\nThe spike has been primarily led by the recent popular memecoin BONK, which gained massively from November to its peak in mid-December. The unexpected surge in SOL price has also continued to raise search interest for Solana during the past couple of weeks.\n\nGoogle Trends data further shows that people who searched for Solana on Google have also searched for BONK and Tensor, a Solana-based NFT marketplace.\n\nSolana has regained much attention in the past three months, with the SOL price rising from nearly $21 on October 1 to peaking over $124 on December 25, recording a gain of over 490% during the period.\n\nSOL is currently trading at $108 with a yearly gain of 1050%, according to data from Coinmarketcap."
