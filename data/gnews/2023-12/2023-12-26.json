        "title": "Three privacy-focused Ethereum L2s arising in 2024 - Blockworks",
        "content": "Several crypto startups are looking to develop the first-ever privacy-centric Ethereum L2.\n\nOn Ethereum today, transactions and other smart contract executions are all publicly visible. Transparency is a core principle of blockchain technology, meant to allow verification of systems and instill confidence, but it can also be a double-edged sword.\n\n\n\nWhile transparency ensures accountability, it also means that the details of these transactions and contracts are exposed to everyone, including malicious actors and hackers who can analyze transaction patterns, identify vulnerabilities in smart contract code, and exploit these weaknesses for nefarious purposes.\n\nPrivacy solutions offer dapp developers the opportunity to build applications that shore up these shortcomings without compromising security.\n\nIn the process, these privacy-first applications must endeavor to prevent harmful actors from concealing their identities, while protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens. In short, to avoid the fate of crypto mixer Tornado Cash, which allegedly was used to launder over $455 million stolen by sanctioned North Korean hackers.\n\nRead More: Tornado Cash Developer\u2019s Arrest Sparks Protest in Amsterdam\n\nHere are a few teams that are hoping to build a functioning privacy-centric L2:\n\nAztec\n\nAztec is a privacy layer of Ethereum. It\u2019s referred to as a hybrid solution using zkSNARKs and its very own programming language, Noir, to offer private transfers, meaning that the network is designed to validate transactions without revealing any sensitive information about them, such as the amount and parties involved.\n\nUnlike other zero-knowledge (zk) rollups on Ethereum, Aztec combines private and public execution in one single zk rollup. Meaning that a user\u2019s own device is responsible for encrypting the transactions before it is processed by the blockchain.\n\nIts primary focus, for now, is to design a platform for engineers to write private smart contracts without requiring in-depth mathematical knowledge of zk proofs. It recently revealed a new testing environment, Aztec Sandbox, for interested developers and plans for a testnet launch early next year.\n\nFhenix\n\nEncryption start-up Fhenix hopes to bring fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to smart contracts.\n\nUnlike privacy startups that use zero-knowledge technology, where data must be moved off-chain and decrypted in order for a prover to verify its accuracy, FHE encryption performs computations directly on encrypted data.\n\nBy keeping data on chain, the network will have the capability to process computations that come from various sources, such as an on-chain poker game or a sealed-bid auction contract.\n\nFhenix launched a developer testnet in July and plans for a full-scale testnet launch of its FHE rollup in early 2024.\n\nCOTI\n\nCOTI is a privacy L2 building on Ethereum. Unlike Aztec, which uses zkSNARKS and Fhenix with FHE, COTI V2 will use so-called Garbled Circuits to enable private transactions.\n\nGarbled Circuits enable two different parties to evaluate information, even if they distrust one another. The parties can each submit their \u2018garbled\u2019 or encrypted inputs, computations are conducted on these inputs and an outcome is obtained.\n\nCOTI will launch a developer testnet V2 in Q2 of 2024, and its mainnet launch will come soon after.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum Gas Fee Concept Explained - LCX",
        "content": "Why Do We Need Gas in the Ethereum Ecosystem?\n\nGas\u2019s primary function is to reduce ETH\u2019s volatility. ETH is publicly tradeable and listed on exchanges. As a result, it is directly subject to market volatility. Petrol is not listed on any exchange, so it is not directly affected by market volatility. An Ethereum smart contract requires more computational power than a straightforward transfer. In order to avoid instability, the fee must be meticulously designed.\n\nHow Is the Gas Price Determined?\n\nGas price is determined by two factors: the gas limit and the price of gas. The sender\u2019s gas limit is the utmost amount of gas they are willing to pay for the transaction. The cost of gas is determined by market supply and demand. The final gas price for the transaction is calculated by multiplying the two prices.\n\nGas Limit * Gas Price = Gas Fee\n\nGas Limit: Gas Limit is the maximum quantity of ETH that the sender is willing to spend on the transaction. Typically, when discussing Gas in Ethereum, one is referring to Gas Limit. Sending ETH requires the shipper to set Gas Limit. If there is insufficient Gas Limit to complete the transfer, the transfer will be cancelled and the shipper will receive a Gas refund. Alternatively, if the sender specifies an excessive Gas Limit, any excess Gas will be returned to the sender.\n\nGas Price: Gas Price indicates the cost of Gas in Gwei. For instance, 1 Gas equals 10 Gwei. It is primarily determined by supply and demand in the market. Gas Price is multiplied by Gas Limit to ascertain the cost of gas.\n\nWhat Are the Factors Affecting Gas Fees?\n\nUnderstanding the dynamics of gas fees involves recognizing the factors that influence their fluctuations:\n\nNetwork Congestion: Ethereum\u2019s popularity has led to network congestion during peak usage times. As more transactions compete for limited block space, gas fees tend to increase.\n\nGas Price: Users can set their preferred gas price. A higher gas price increases the likelihood of a transaction being processed promptly, but it also incurs higher costs.\n\nTransaction Complexity: The computational resources required to execute a transaction or smart contract influence its gas fee. More complex operations demand more gas.\n\nGas Limit: Each Ethereum transaction has a gas limit, which represents the maximum amount of gas a user is willing to spend. If a transaction\u2019s computational requirements exceed the gas limit, the transaction will fail, and the user will still be charged.\n\nExternal Events: Market fluctuations, platform upgrades, and major smart contract executions can impact gas fees.\n\nWhat Are the Strategies to Optimize Gas Fees?\n\nNavigating the Ethereum gas fee landscape requires a strategic approach. Consider these tips to optimize your transactions:\n\nGas Estimators: Various online tools and wallets provide gas estimators that recommend a suitable gas price based on network conditions. These estimators help you strike a balance between prompt execution and cost efficiency.\n\nOff-Peak Usage: Initiate transactions during periods of lower network activity. Gas fees tend to be lower during off-peak times.\n\nLayer 2 Solutions: Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, aim to alleviate Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues by processing transactions off-chain and settling them on-chain. These solutions can significantly reduce gas fees and transaction times.\n\nBatch Transactions: Some wallets and platforms allow users to bundle multiple transactions into a single batch. This approach can save on gas costs, as multiple transactions are processed in a single block.\n\nGas Tokens: Gas tokens are tokens that can be minted when gas prices are low and burned (destroyed) when gas prices are high. This mechanism enables users to hedge against future gas price increases.\n\nSmart Contract Efficiency: Developers can optimize smart contracts to minimize gas consumption. This includes techniques like reducing unnecessary storage operations and using more efficient algorithms.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum gas fees are an integral aspect of the network\u2019s functionality. While they can present challenges, they are also a testament to Ethereum\u2019s popularity and utility. By understanding the factors that influence gas fees and implementing optimization strategies, users can navigate the Ethereum ecosystem more effectively and make the most of its innovative applications."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin outlines new Ethereum PoS strategy for post-Shanghai era - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "In a detailed blog post dated Dec. 27, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin outlined a significant shift in Ethereum\u2019s approach to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validation following its Shanghai upgrade.\n\nEthereum currently supports many validators, with approximately 895,000 validator objects enabling a broad individual and entity participation base. This is a key feature of Ethereum\u2019s decentralized structure.\n\nHowever, this model presents technical challenges, notably the processing of an immense number of signatures. About 28,000 signatures are required to validate a block today; that number is projected to reach 1.79 million post-SSF (Sharding and Staking Finality).\n\nThe technical sacrifices for supporting such a load are considerable. They include complex attestation propagation mechanisms, the need for hyper-optimized BLS signature operations, the lack of a viable quantum-resistant alternative, and increased slot times due to more sub-slots.\n\nButerin also highlights the current model\u2019s systemic complexity and potential ineffectiveness in truly democratizing staking, as the minimum staking requirement of 32 ETH remains financially prohibitive for many.\n\n8,192 signatures\n\nIn response, Buterin proposes a pivot that would reduce the number of signatures per slot to a manageable 8,192. This change, he argues, would open up the PoS design space, allow technical simplification, improve security, and address quantum resistance concerns.\n\nButerin critiques the committee-based security approach used by other blockchains, emphasizing the lack of accountability and insufficient deterrents against attacks. Ethereum, in contrast, imposes severe penalties on attackers. Still, Buterin suggests that even a reduced cost of attack (1-2 million ETH) would be sufficient, advocating for a balanced solution that maintains high penalties but offers more benefits than a smaller validator set.\n\nThe blog post explores three approaches for implementing the 8,192 signatures per slot under SSF:\n\nDecentralized Staking Pools: Focusing solely on decentralized stake pools, potentially raising the minimum deposit size, and capping penalties to reduce trust in node operators. Two-Tiered Staking: Establish a \u201cheavy\u201d layer for major stakers involved in finalization and a \u201clight\u201d layer for additional security, with no minimum stake requirement. Rotating Participation (Accountable Committees): A hybrid approach where validators participate based on their stake, ensuring safety through carefully adjusted validator sets.\n\nButerin\u2019s conclusion emphasizes that sticking to 8,192 signatures would greatly simplify technical implementation and make Ethereum more accessible. The focus would then shift to choosing the most suitable approach from the proposed options.\n\nSecurity through simplicity\n\nSome users raised concerns in the comments about designing systems resilient against state attackers, suggesting that even a reduced security budget might be insufficient. Buterin responded by emphasizing the importance of simplicity in protocol design as a means of defense against various attack vectors, advocating for \u201csecurity through simplicity.\u201d\n\nThis proposed shift signifies a pivotal moment in Ethereum\u2019s ongoing development, highlighting the constant balance of security, decentralization, and usability."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nLark Davis predicts Ethereum\u2019s significant rise in 2024.\n\nPotential ETH value forecasted at $15,000 per coin.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum is considered a low-risk crypto move.\n\nCrypto YouTuber Lark Davis has been making headlines, predicting a significant upswing for Ethereum in 2024. Davis notes that while Ethereum has been underperforming compared to its peers this year, it\u2019s poised for a big move.\n\nEthereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think pic.twitter.com/00YCLPyGCl \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 25, 2023\n\nDavis also forecasts a potential rise in Ethereum\u2019s value to around $15,000 per coin during the 2024-2025 bull cycle, assuming gains similar to or slightly less than the previous cycle.\n\nHis prediction is based on a hypothetical 200% increase from Ethereum\u2019s previous high of about $4,880 in November 2021. For current buyers, this could mean a 500-600% gain, which Davis considers a relatively low-risk bet in the crypto world. He emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s strong fundamentals despite recent disinterest from the crypto community.\n\nSo, is he right to think so?\n\nETH Price Prediction 2024\n\nAfter reaching its all-time high of $4,820, the price of ETH fell by 81%, measured to its lowest point of $880 in this bear cycle made on June 18, 2022. It started a recovery and was mostly trending upward in 2023, resulting in a high of $2,400 on December 9.\n\nEthereum didn\u2019t go any lower, contrary to the general market trend, as we saw lower prices for most of the cryptos in November and December of 2022 before they started their significant recoveries.\n\nETH has performed worse than the general market since the start of 2023, but measuring from the June 18 low, it still outperformed many of its altcoin competitors, recovering 171%.\n\nIt formed an ascending triangle, which could be a leading diagonal as the first sub-wave of the larger five-wave impulse in the starting bull market. We are waiting for its wave 2 \u2013 the first bull market correction that can push the price back to the $1,600 area.\n\nThat would be similar to the horizontal structure seen in the last pre-bull market consolidation from December 2018 until December 2019 and mark the end of the accumulation period.\n\nAfter it ends, we look at the start of a stronger move for its wave 3, which will bring the price to its new all-time high of around $5,000. From the strength and the price this move reaches, we could evaluate the possibility of ETH going to $15,000 at its peak in the next bull run.\n\nHowever, in conclusion, this price target isn\u2019t unrealistic and is only a 200% increase since its previous all-time high, making it highly possible.\n\nDisclaimers\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "Ethereum's Dencun Upgrade To Begin Testing on Goerli Testnet on January 17\n\nEthereum's upcoming \"Dencun\" upgrade (also known as \"Cancun-Deneb\"), will begin testing on the Goerli testnet on January 17, according to an official note published on the Ethereum GitHub repository.\n\nThe upgrade will then be added to the Sepolia testnet on January 30 and Holesky on February 7. The Ethereum team has not yet announced when Dencun will be implemented on the mainnet.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade includes several tools aimed at reducing fees, enabling new features for bridges and staking pools, and limiting the use of self-destruct operations on smart contracts.\n\nOne of the key features of Dencun is the inclusion of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, also known as \"proto-danksharding.\"\n\nThis will allow layer-2 (L2) rollup networks to store certain transaction data temporarily using a new format called \"blobs.\" Blobs can be deleted after 18 days, significantly reducing transaction fees on layer 2s. This is a highly anticipated upgrade for L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nOther notable proposals in the Dencun upgrade include:\n\nEIP-1153: Introduces a \"transient storage\" system to further reduce fees.\n\nEIP-4788: Increases transparency by storing the root of each Beacon Chain block in a smart contract.\n\nEIP-6780: Limits the use of the self-destruct keyword to prevent the erasure of smart contract code and the transfer of funds to the deployer.\n\nEthereum upgrades typically undergo testing for a few months before being deployed to the mainnet. The previous upgrade, codenamed \"Shapella,\" began testing in February and was launched to the mainnet in April. Shapella was a major upgrade and saw Ethereum transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price looks poised for a continuation of the uptrend, with several technical indicators favoring the upside.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana price is likely to face a correction after a multi-month period of SOL being massively overbought.\n\nETH could rise almost 7% to hit $2,500 amid rising momentum and a possible pending buy signal.\n\nA break and close below the critical support at $2,147 would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price looks poised for a shine after a prolonged contention against its peer in the Layer 1 space, Solana (SOL). This brings to mind previous reports where Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko said he envisions a future where SOL and Ether co-exist, urging that the whole narrative of one ecosystem kills the other be binned.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto hack: Ethereum, Solana DeFi trading platform Thunder exploited for $239,000\n\nEther displays upside potential as Solana price shows weakness\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has spent the better part of December consolidating between the critical support at $ 2,147 and the $2,380 resistance level. Based on technicals such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the largest cryptocurrency may be poised to shine, at least for the short term.\n\nMeanwhile, the SOL market is exhibiting weakness, as the technical indicators hint at a possible dip in the Solana price. It comes after a prolonged period of SOL being massively overbought, indicated by the presence of the RSI above the 70 level since October 18, when the markets turned bullish. This preceded a correction.\n\nSOL/USDT 1-day chart, ETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nEthereum price outlook with ETH shining at Solana\u2019s expense\n\nAfter Solana price\u2019s epic surge across the fourth quarter, the SOL market is taking a breather, with capital flowing into Ether. With this, Ethereum price looks ready to shine at the expense of Solana.\n\nThe RSI is northbound, suggesting rising momentum. The Awesome Oscillators (AO) indicator remains in the positive territory, adding credence to the bullish thesis. Increased buying pressure above current levels, therefore, could see Ethereum price rise, potentially flipping the $2,380 resistance level to a support before testing the $2,403 range high.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the gains could extend for Ethereum price to tag the forecasted $2,500 psychological level, in a move that would constitute a 7% climb above current levels.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the $2,380 roadblock holds as resistance, the ensuing rejection could see Ethereum price lose the critical support at $2,147, below which the bullish outlook would be invalidated. In the dire case, Ether market value could descend to test the supply barrier that now acts as a bullish breaker between $2,049 and $2,107.\n\nA break and close below the midline at $2,075 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend, with Ethereum price likely to spiral towards the $2,049 support, levels last tested in November."

It's currently trading hands for $4.11.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd Arbitrum (ARB), which also cuts Ethereum costs and fees, is up by over 16% in 24 hours, coming in priced at $1.50.\n\nMeanwhile MATIC, the 13th biggest digital currency by market cap which runs on Polygon, is up 12% over the day. Its price currently stands at little over a dollar at $1.05.\n\nEthereum scalers speed things up on the notoriously expensive and costly blockchain by settling them on a layer-2 network or sidechain before reporting back to Ethereum. The idea is that developers can build things with ease until Ethereum's congestion issues are potentially sorted through future upgrades.\n\nSuch projects have received renewed interest this year as those wanting to speed up Ethereum have worked hard on building solutions to its slow network.\n\nThe boom in such projects' prices comes at a time when major Ethereum-competitor Solana (SOL) has been on a tremendous run.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThough SOL is up less than 2% today following recent spikes, over the past three months it has surged by over 440%, having made a comeback through November and December.

This level coincides closely with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level indicating the overall trend of this asset remains bullish. With an intraday gain of 5.3%, the ETH price has just offered a breakout above the resistance trendline which traced the correction trend indicating an early signal of uptrend continuation.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Ain\u2019t Dead: Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Can Outperform Bitcoin in Q1 2024\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs ETH Price Ready to Surpass $2500\n\nThe ETH price breakout from the overhead trendline should release the build-up momentum\n\nThe coin buyers may face potential supply pressure at $2400, followed by $2665\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $12.8 Billion, indicating a 30% gain.\n\nAfter witnessing steady growth from mid-October to early December, the Ethereum price shifted its projection sideways in line with the current market uncertainty. This last three weeks\u2019 consolidation gives a view of price sustainability at higher levels and a short breather per buyers to recuperate the rest of the time.\n\nInterestingly, the ETH price was actively rebounding from two converging trendlines which acted as a dynamic resistance and support. Today, the Ethereum price witnessed a significant inflow, which led to a decisive breakout from the upper trendline in the 4-hour time frame chart.\n\nShould this candle close above the breached level, the buyers would obtain an early signal of uptrend continuation.

In case this resistance triggers another correction, the coin holders can rely on an ascending trendline that has been offering dynamic support to the ETH price for nearly two months. The coin price rebounded several times from the support project the buyers continued to accumulate at market dips, which is a strong signal of an established uptrend. On the contrary, a breakdown below this support would trigger a significant correction in ETH price\n\nBollinger Band: The flattish upper boundary of the Bollinger Band indicator offers an additional layer of resistance at $2400\n\nVortex Indicator: A bullish crossover between the VI+ and VI- slope signals a recovery trend in active."

        "content": "In a recent exchange on social media, Solana creator Anatoly Yakovenko, made a remark that was misinterpreted in our previous coverage.\n\nIn a Dec. 25 tweet, Yakovenko playfully suggested that Solana could be considered an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution through its Wormhole eigenlayer. This statement was part of a tongue-in-cheek response to a tweet listing various L2 solutions like Arbitrum, Aztec, and Polygon. He quipped:\n\n\u201cSolana is ethereum! Solana is an ethereum L2 through the wormhole eigenlayer. Once danksharding is scaled up no one is going to stop you from submitting all the Solana blocks into some data validating bridge contract on ethereum.\u201d\n\nThis playful assertion was meant to ironically juxtapose Solana, a distinct and independent blockchain, with Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 solutions. The mention of a Wormhole eigenlayer and the speculative reference to submitting Solana blocks to Ethereum were part of this jest.\n\nOur initial report, however, presented it seriously and failed to recognize its ironic nature, and thus our coverage suggested that he meant it in earnest. We sincerely apologize for the error and for any confusion caused by our failure to recognize the ironic intent behind it.\n\nOn the rise\n\nYakovenko\u2019s jesting aside, Solana is poised to close the year on a high note. December was a particularly active month for the blockchain, showcasing one of the quickest price recoveries in the final quarter. The total value locked (TVL) on Solana more than doubled, escalating from $671.62 million at the beginning of the month to $1.529 billion by December 26th.\n\nHowever, when denominated in SOL, the increase was more modest, from 11.35 million SOL to 12.56 million SOL in the same period. This discrepancy reflects the significant rise in SOL price, which climbed from $59.2 to $121.4, affecting the USD valuation of the TVL.\n\nNotably, Solana overtook XRP in market cap, becoming the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $34.8 billion as of December 20, 2023, following an 11% increase in Solana\u2019s value, which outpaced the broader market\u2019s 3% gain. The SOL/ETH ratio, comparing Solana\u2019s value to Ethereum\u2019s, also shows recovery, highlighting Solana\u2019s competitive stance.\n\nThe SOL/ETH ratio, a metric comparing the value of Solana (SOL) to Ethereum (ETH), is a critical measure of Solana\u2019s competitive position. This ratio has experienced significant fluctuations, with the most recent data showing a recovery in Solana\u2019s standing against Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain technology, known for its high performance and scalability, is designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases. The platform\u2019s success is attributed to its unique consensus algorithm, \u201cProof of History,\u201d which enables high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a popular choice among developers for dApps and DeFi projects."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent development that has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, has raised eyebrows with a significant withdrawal of $13.8 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) from Binance. The transaction was highlighted by PeckShieldAlert, a prominent blockchain security company, in a tweet that raised suspicions surrounding the withdrawal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tweet mentioned that the address 0x9FCc...19Fe had initiated a withdrawal of 6,166 ETH (equivalent to approximately $13.8 million) from Binance. The mention of \"Suspicious Justin Sun related\" has triggered concerns and speculation within the crypto space, leading many to question the motives behind such a substantial withdrawal.\n\nAs of the latest data , the current price of Ethereum stands at $2,239, reflecting a 1.55% decrease in the last 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency has witnessed a more significant surge of 7.22% over the past 30 days. Interestingly, despite recent market fluctuations, Ethereum's trading volume has surged by over 14.89% in the last 24 hours, reaching a total of $9,184,315,852.\n\nJustin Sun's cryptic moves\n\nThis development comes on the heels of Justin Sun's earlier notable withdrawals, where he pulled out massive amounts of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens from Binance. The first withdrawal involved a staggering 500 billion SHIB tokens, followed by another withdrawal of approximately 77 billion SHIB tokens. These transactions had already raised eyebrows within the crypto community, prompting discussions about Sun's strategic moves on the market.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, on May 11, Justin Sun announced his decision to actively engage in trading meme coins and promising projects through his public address. The declaration indicated a shift in Sun's investment strategy, opting for more speculative and meme-driven digital assets.\n\nThe latest Ethereum withdrawal only adds to the growing concerns and speculations surrounding Justin Sun's cryptocurrency activities. The crypto community is now closely monitoring further statements or actions from Sun that may shed light on his motives and intentions behind these significant transactions."

Arkham added that Trump\u2019s wallet previously held $4 million at its peak.\n\nLive Arkham data shows that Trump currently holds $1.39 million of ETH. He additionally holds $644,000 in MATIC and small amounts of other cryptocurrency tokens for a total of $2.22 million. Arkham\u2019s data additionally indicates that the wallet did not initiate any transfers to exchanges before December.\n\nThough Arkham suggested that Trump is selling the recently transferred holdings, the attached transaction log only shows deposits to Coinbase. The log does not explicitly show that he has sold or converted the funds to another asset.\n\nFunds likely linked to NFT sales\n\nThe crypto wallet in question is believed to belong to Trump based on Arkham Intelligence\u2019s findings. Arkham asserted in August that the wallet belonged to Trump based on information in a financial statement released that month.\n\nForbes India separately reported on Trump\u2019s financial disclosure at the time. The wallet\u2019s balance appears to originate at least in part from Trump\u2019s NFT sales.\n\nSales of the Trump-themed NFTs are conducted through a firm called NFT International LLC. The company claims it does not operate under Trump. However, Trump has been highly involved in promoting the NFTs and has hosted various events for those who purchase the collectibles. He has seemingly collected royalties and revenue from the sales, as explained above.\n\nThe company has so far released three series of NFTs. The latest batch of NFTs attempted to capitalize on Trump\u2019s recent arrest by featuring his mugshot photo. High-quantity purchases included a physical card with pieces of Trump\u2019s suit."

ETH is moving lower and might even test $2,050 before the bulls take a stand.\n\nEthereum is correcting gains below the $2,250 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,240 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere are two bearish trend lines forming with resistance near $2,230 and $2,260 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could extend its decline and revisit the $2,050 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Extends Losses\n\nEthereum price started a downside correction from the $2,325 level. ETH declined below the $2,300 and $2,265 levels. The bears were even able to push the pair below the $2,200 level, like Bitcoin.\n\nA low was formed near $2,180 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. There was a move above the $2,200 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,326 swing high to the $2,180 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,240 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,230 level. There are two bearish trend lines forming with resistance near $2,230 and $2,260 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nThe second trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,326 swing high to the $2,180 low. A close above the $2,260 resistance could send the price toward $2,325.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe main resistance sits at $2,350. A clear move above the $2,350 zone could start a decent increase. The next resistance sits at $2,420, above which Ethereum might rally and test the $2,500 zone.\n\nMore Downsides in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,260 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,200 level.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,180 zone. A downside break and a close below $2,180 might spark more bearish moves. In the stated case, Ether could revisit the $2,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,050 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,180\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,260\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Solana [SOL] generated tremendous hype in 2021, with fans touting its ability to solve the Ethereum [ETH] blockchain's core problem. Solana, it was promised, would be a cheaper and faster place to handle transactions, a better springboard for decentralized finance, or DeFi, and other activities powered by smart contracts.\n\nThen came 2022 and all that pain. Things looked bleak for Solana (and, let's be honest, most of crypto). It didn't help that Sam Bankman-Fried was closely linked to Solana and its SOL token, which sank below $10.\n\nYou're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nSOL was back in the $20s in October as SBF was on trial. Then, all of a sudden, Solana and SOL turned into just about the hottest things going. SOL is above $100 now for the first time since early 2022 and, at $47 billion, it's the fifth-biggest crypto \u2013 and it was briefly fourth-biggest earlier this week.\n\nName Market Capitalization Bitcoin (BTC) $854 billion Ethereum (ETH) $288 billion Tether (USDT) $92 billion BNB $49 billion Solana (SOL) $47 billion XRP $35 billion\n\nMy colleague Danny Nelson cogently summed up recent events this weekend when SOL exceeded $100:\n\nSaturday's price action capped weeks of frenzied trading that have \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 vaulted the Solana blockchain up the leaderboard for on-chain activity. Solana-based decentralized exchanges are nearing Uniswap's multibillion-dollar trading volumes for the first time, according to DefiLlama. Much of that energy is being driven by rampant speculation.\n\nSome of the most popular crypto assets being traded on Solana right now are dog-themed meme coins. But airdrops, too, are prompting droves of traders to test out Solana-based lenders, bridges and other infrastructure.\n\nEthereum remains the leader among layer-1 blockchains that can run smart contracts, aka the bedrock of DeFi. Ethereum has $29 billion of total value locked, a measure of money stashed in a particular blockchain's ecosystem, far exceeding Solana's $1.5 billion, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nBut recent events show Solana may be a serious competitor now.\n\nHere's what else is on my mind in this holiday-shortened week:\n\nA LONG DECADE: The failure amid a hack of Mt. Gox a decade ago was a milestone for the industry, an early sign crypto would need better infrastructure to thrive or, at least, survive. Some 850,000 bitcoins were stolen in that incident, a hoard now worth about $36 billion. All these years later, it appears former customers are starting to get repaid. From CoinDesk's coverage: \"The repayment could have some impact on bitcoin prices, due to the sheer volume of the tokens being released, but would not destablize the market, UBS had said in a report earlier this year.\"\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Discover SCENE\n\nSolana, which soared past the $100 mark over the weekend, has cooled slightly. At the time of this writing, SOL is trading for $109.20\u2014down 11% in the past day.\n\nBut notably, SOL has remained above $100 since it edged past that milestone on Saturday. This increase is part of a broader positive trend in the crypto market, with Solana's market capitalization ranking it as the fourth largest crypto asset. That's spurred a lot of trading activity. In the past day, volume reached $5.6 billion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, SOL did its highest 1-day volume of the year\u2014$6.2 billion\u2014and could be on track to beat that again today. It's now doing more than double the volume that Binance's BNB token has seen in the past day. BNB is a utility token for the Binance crypto exchange, which is used to trade and pay fees. Solana recently flipped BNB and took its spot as the fourth-largest asset by market capitalization on CoinGecko.\n\nMeanwhile Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest crypto assets by market capitalization, have each taken a 4% haircut. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $41,861.48 and Ethereum for $2,197.27.\n\nBoth BTC and ETH have rallied, thanks to anticipation around possible spot ETF approvals. A handful of Ethereum ETF applications have only recently been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but analysts expect that the SEC will issue a decision on several Bitcoin ETF applications in the next two weeks.\n\nSolana's recent performance has been particularly noteworthy, considering its association with the fallen crypto empire FTX and the disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried. Despite the turmoil surrounding FTX's bankruptcy in November 2022, Solana has made a remarkable recovery, with an 880% increase year-to-date. This rebound is further highlighted by a significant rise in network activities and an increase in new addresses on the Solana network.\n\nThe institutional interest has been accompanied by lots of meme coin activity. Solana meme coin BONK has held onto its place in the top 100 assets, although it has fallen a bit since rising as high as 69. BONK hit an all-time high after it began trading on Coinbase. Despite its rapid rise, it's still an incredibly volatile meme coin. It's currently trading for $0.00001615, down 15% since yesterday.\n\nThere's an even newer dog-themed meme coin, too: Dogwifhat. It rose as high as $0.33 on Friday\u2014an all-time high for the coin that had only started trading on December 13. However, it has since lost some of that momentum and is currently trading at $0.15, down 30% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

        "content": "A trader who accurately called the bottom of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2018 bear market thinks that the uptrend of one Ethereum (ETH) challenger that has massively outperformed the broader crypto markets this year is far from over.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 233,400 followers on the social media platform X that the people who are calling for the end of Solana\u2019s (SOL) big rally this year will most likely miss out on the altcoin\u2019s surge to a fresh all-time high (ATH).\n\nAccording to Bluntz, Solana has a lot more gas left in the tank as he predicts that SOL could still print gains of more than 257% from current levels.\n\n\u201cSOL is still 113% away from ATH. Why is everyone so hell-bent on calling tops? What the f**k is wrong with y\u2019all?\n\nJust buy dips all the way to $400.\n\nNot a single person is ever going to remember the guy who may or may not have been successful in shorting a 10% move down, but they will remember the chads who long all the way to inevitable all-time highs.\n\nDon\u2019t overthink it, SOL is this cycle\u2019s darling chain, embrace it.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is worth $112, up more than 1,000% from this year\u2019s opening price of $9.99.\n\nLooking at the low time frame charts of Solana, the trader thinks that the altcoin is poised for another leg up against both the US dollar and Bitcoin (SOL/BTC).\n\n\u201cNice little 12% dip there on SOL in a monster uptrend with a few more legs to go in my opinion on the BTC pair and USD pair. Don\u2019t fight the trend.\u201d\n\nBluntz uses the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis in an attempt to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave uptrend to be followed by an ABC correction before the next leg up.\n\nLooking at the analyst\u2019s SOL/USD pair, he seems to suggest that the pair is in a position to rally once more after completing an ABC correction. For the SOL/BTC pair, he appears to predict that it could rise above 0.0034 BTC, worth $144.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Today\u2019s edition is brought to you by Metal X \u2013 the all-in-one crypto platform equipped with trading, lending, borrowing and yield farming, and powered by the XPR Network and the expertise of Metallicus.\n\nEnhance your DeFi experience!\n\nGM. This is Milk Road, the newsletter that\u2019s like a pi\u00f1ata \u2013 whack it open and savor the sweet, sweet pieces of crypto knowledge.\n\nHere\u2019s what we got for ya today:\n\nThe 4 most interesting charts we saw during Christmas \ud83d\udc40\n\nCrypto court cases will heat up in 2024 \u2013 here are the ones to watch \ud83c\udf6a\n\nTHE 4 MOST INTERESTING CHARTS WE SAW DURING CHRISTMAS \ud83d\udc40\n\n1/ Solana is dominating stablecoin volume.\n\nLast week, Solana made history\u2026 it passed all other blockchains in daily stablecoin transfer volume, for the first time ever.\n\nAnd for 7 out of the last 10 days, Solana has kept that lead. Including $12B in stablecoin volume yesterday alone.\n\nWhy this matters: Stablecoin transfer volume is a good sign that investors are loading up funds to do stuff on a blockchain \u2013 i.e. buy tokens/NFTs, provide liquidity to protocols, etc.\n\nThink of it like going to Chuck E. Cheese as a kid. (Btw, if you aren\u2019t familiar, it\u2019s the Las Vegas strip for toddlers \u2013 except instead of poker, roulette, and alcohol, it has juice boxes, ski-ball, and claw machines).\n\nIt\u2019s awesome. But every time you\u2019d go, you\u2019d have to swap your (parents) cash for some tokens to play.\n\nWell, stablecoins are like the Chuck E. Cheese tokens of crypto. More stablecoin supply on Solana = more money people are likely to spend \u201cplaying\u201d there.\n\n2/ Ethereum\u2019s next big upgrade is coming in early 2024\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s no official date for when the upgrade will go live on Ethereum\u2019s main network, but developers did release a preliminary schedule for the tests.\n\nThink of it like clinical trials \u2013 a drug has to go through phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, etc. before it gets to humans.\n\nSame thing with Ethereum. And here are the dates for the tests:\n\nPhase 1: Goerli (scheduled for Jan 17).\n\nPhase 2: Sepolia (scheduled for Jan 30).\n\nPhase 3: Holesky (scheduled for Feb 7).\n\nPhase 4: Ethereum\u2019s mainnet (not scheduled yet).\n\nCrazy, I know. The testing networks all sound like STDs you tried avoiding in college\u2026\n\nAnyway, why does this matter? \u201cDencun\u201d will be the first major upgrade for Ethereum in a year. And it includes something called EIP-4844 (AKA \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d).\n\nWe won\u2019t get into all the nerdy, technical details today (wouldn\u2019t want you to proto-dankshard-your-pants the day after Christmas), but we\u2019ll dive deeper in future editions.\n\nThe #1 thing you need to know right now is\u2026 the upgrade is supposed to significantly reduce gas fees for Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 rollups \u2013 like Optimism, Abritrum, Polygon, etc.\n\nCheck it out:\n\nMilk Road Prediction: L2 tokens ($MATIC, $ARB, $OP, etc.) could perform well as the Dencun upgrade gets closer and the narrative around it gets stronger.\n\n3/ Bitcoin\u2019s security budget.\n\nHere\u2019s a crazy stat for ya\u2026 (courtesy of our pal, Kofi).\n\nWhy this matters: According to Kofi, this will be the first year where Bitcoin\u2019s annual security budget as % of the market cap will be higher than the year before (from 1.8% to 1.9%).\n\nThis is a good thing. Think of the security budget as the amount miners earn for securing the network\u2026\n\nThe higher the value, the more secure Bitcoin is. The network turns into crypto\u2019s Fort Knox \u2013 unbreakable.\n\nThe lower the value, the less secure Bitcoin is. The network turns into a bank vault made of Lego pieces \u2013 easy to break.\n\n4/ VCs invested over $10B into crypto startups in 2023.\n\nWe\u2019ve got good news and bad news\u2026\n\nThe good news: Crypto startups raised $10.7B this year.\n\nThe bad news: That\u2019s down 68% from last year ($33.3B was raised in 2022).\n\nMilk Road Take: Crypto startups raising $10.7B during a bear market is pretty impressive (even if it was technically a \u201cdown\u201d year)\u2026\n\nAnd with the market heating up again, we predict this number will 3x in 2024 and hit a new all-time high. You heard it here first.\n\nTHE BEST DEFI APP YOU\u2019VE NEVER HEARD OF What happens when you combine the power and speed of the XPR Network and the expertise of Metallicus?

        "title": "What is a spot ETH ETF: is an Ethereum ETF approval next? - OKX",
        "content": "As the excitement of BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF builds, we're seeing increased speculation about what crypto-themed exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be next. Chief among these rumors is how a spot Ether (ETH) ETF might be next given its popularity among institutions and retail traders. As the cryptocurrency with the second-highest market cap in the crypto space, a spot ETH ETF may certainly be on the cards once the spot BTC ETF is fully approved by regulators. Curious about the likelihood of a spot ETH ETF coming to fruition? From understanding what a spot ETF is to highlighting the pros and cons of trading a spot Ether ETF, here's everything you'll need to know when it comes to navigating through the volatility accompanied by the possibilities of a spot Ether ETF announcement.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nConceived in 2013, Ethereum is a popular decentralized blockchain platform with smart contract utility. It revolutionized the crypto world by introducing self-governing smart contracts, allowing users to create and execute automated agreements. Ethereum's ecosystem thrives on the Ether (ETH) cryptocurrency, which acts as a fee for transactions and powers a diverse range of decentralized applications (DApps) like DeFi lending platforms and NFT marketplaces. These DApps operate without a central authority, opening up new possibilities across various fields.\n\nWhy is Ethereum so popular?\n\nAmong the various altcoins in the crypto space, Ethereum shines as a particularly captivating ecosystem for both retail and institutional crypto traders. Given its decade of growth and influence within the crypto space, Ethereum has certainly stood the test of time as it stands shoulders above other altcoins that were conceived in the early 2010s. As the first platform to pull off smart contracts without a hitch, Ethereum has achieved numerous feats that include introducing the first-ever NFT standard in 2018 and making a full transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake as part of the Ethereum Merge. These milestones combined with the fervent Ethereum community and extensive number of DApps in the Ethereum ecosystem make Ethereum a powerhouse in the crypto space.\n\nNow that we understand what Ethereum is and why it's so popular, let's dive into the fundamentals of a potential spot ETH ETF.\n\nWhat is a spot ETH ETF?\n\nAlso known as a physically-backed Ether ETF, the spot ETH ETF resembles traditional exchange-traded funds, where institutions managing the ETF commit to purchasing ETH and holding ETH in their reserves. The ETF is then listed on a traditional stock exchange and issues shares representing ownership of the ETF. This effectively means traders gain exposure to the underlying ETH held in the institution's reserves when trading the spot ETH ETF.\n\nOne key thing to take note of when trading the spot ETH ETF is that owning shares of a spot ETH ETF doesn't directly grant ownership of individual ETH tokens held by the institution. Shareholders hold claims on the value of the ETH holdings, not the Ether itself. Additionally, while institutions hold the underlying ETH, they may utilize various strategies to manage it, such as lending it out or using it for staking, to potentially generate additional returns for the ETF.\n\nWho is the spot ETH ETF for?\n\nMany believe that the spot ETH ETF will be perfect for TradFi traders who are used to trading stocks and ETFs on traditional brokerages. While directly trading Ether has its charm, it's not for everyone given the inaccessibility and numerous barriers to entry that cryptocurrencies are known for. That's where spot ETH ETFs comes in. As setting up wallets, navigating exchanges, and managing private keys can sometimes feel alien and complex, spot ETH ETFs will ease traders who are more familiar with TradFi in gaining exposure to ETH. By trading spot ETH ETFs, traders with little to no experience in crypto can gain convenient exposure to ETH's price movements without needing a cryptocurrency wallet or dealing with the intricacies of directly buying and storing ETH.\n\nHow does a spot ETH ETF work?\n\nConfused about how a spot ETH ETF works? Think of the spot ETH ETF as a pool where traders contribute funds to buy ETH. This pool then tracks the price of Ether by holding the coins directly. When the price of Ethereum rises, the value of the ETF shares goes up proportionally, and vice versa. This is distinct from ETH futures-based ETFs, which track ETH's price through derivatives like ETH futures without holding the underlying asset.\n\nTo keep pace with the constantly fluctuating price of ETH, the ETF manager works behind the scenes to monitor the market and adjust the ETF's ETH holdings as needed. This typically involves creation and redemption units, which are large blocks of shares exchanged for the underlying Ether. This delicate balancing act aims to ensure your ETF shares accurately reflect the real-time market value of Ethereum, though slight differences can occur due to factors like trading costs and rebalancing schedules.\n\nAdvantages of trading spot ETH ETFs\n\nLowering the barrier to entry to gaining crypto exposure\n\nAs mentioned above, crypto can be hard to get into because of the numerous points for potential friction that will deter anyone new to crypto trading. This can range from fumbling during the Know Your Customer process to choosing the right spot pair to trade the crypto you want. With the spot ETH ETF, traders who already have trading accounts with established TradFi brokerages can simply look up the ticker for the spot ETH ETF and trade it as they normally would with any other forex pair or stock.\n\nBeing open to institutional traders\n\nIf a spot ETH ETF gets approved, trading ETH will become even more accessible from an institutional perspective. As institutions like pension funds and asset managers may have specific regulations that prevent them from trading Ether and other coins directly, smart money has long been barred off from gaining exposure to cryptocurrencies. With a spot ETH ETF, they might have a better chance of being allowed to trade it as it's an SEC-approved trading vehicle.\n\nNew ways to trade ETH\n\nOn top of traders buying and selling shares of spot ETH ETFs, traders can also consider alternative methods of trading spot ETH ETF shares. This can range from short-selling it to the downside if they're intending to hedge their overall portfolio or are bearish about Ether to executing options strategies like covered calls to generate additional gains on their spot ETH ETF holdings. Such alternatives will inject a fresh amount of liquidity into the crypto market as more traders gain exposure to Ether through trading the spot ETH ETF.\n\nDisadvantages of trading spot ETH ETFs\n\nETF expense ratios\n\nFor those new to trading ETFs, one thing to take note of is expense ratios, which measures how much of a fund's assets are used for administrative and other operating expenses. While the exact ratio is yet to be known since no spot ETH ETFs have been approved as of the time of writing, we can take Bitcoin futures ETFs for reference. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF has an expense ratio of 0.95%. This is considerably higher compared to other ETFs and mutual funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, which has an expense ratio of 0.03%. As this is an annualized fee that compounds over the length of time that traders hold the ETF, overall gains earned from trading the spot ETH ETF will definitely be impacted.\n\nETH ownership\n\nAs previously mentioned, share traders technically don't own the Ether since it's managed by the spot ETH ETF manager, who could potentially be lending out or staking the ETH for extra yield. This brings into question concerns of true ownership, since \"not your keys, not your coins\" is a mantra that many crypto natives swear by. This could be a major concern if the ETF liquidates its assets and closes down the line.\n\nThe limitation of regular trading hours\n\nCrypto markets are famous for being available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about spot ETH ETFs, whose shares are subject to the regular trading hours of when a typical stock market opens and closes. Due to this limitation, traders could potentially miss out on potential opportunities during times when the stock market is closed.\n\nIs a spot ETH ETF approval coming?\n\nAs the spot BTC ETF is close to getting approved, bullish ETH traders can't help but wonder when a spot ETH ETF might be available for trading. This speculation further intensified when institutions like BlackRock and ARK Invest proceeded to officially file for spot ETH ETF approvals. Unfortunately, the Securities and Exchange Commission has put these expectations to a halt as they've recently delayed its decision to May 2024. While this might've dampened the hopes of spot ETH ETF traders, many are still holding onto the hope that the spot BTC ETF approval will set a precedent for the crypto scene and lead to the eventual approval of many more spot crypto ETFs.\n\nShould you buy Ether instead?\n\nAlthough spot ETH ETF shares may offer convenience that's considered useful for traders, the truth is that owning spot ETH ETF shares differs greatly from owning Ether directly. That raises the question \u2014 why not just buy ETH itself? To dissect this question further, it's important to consider your priorities and goals as a trader. If you're a trader that's inexperienced with trading crypto and simply want exposure to Ethereum, trading spot ETH ETF shares may be perfect for you. However, if you're a trader that prioritizes ownership and freedom to trade at whatever timing, then the spot ETH ETF might not be suitable for you.\n\nFinal words and next steps\n\nSpot ETH ETFs offer a compelling bridge between the allure of Ethereum and the familiarity of TradFi. Its availability as an option for traders represents a significant step forward in making Ethereum accessible to a wider audience. By simplifying access to crypto and allowing for diversification of trading portfolios, the spot ETH ETF opens the world of crypto to a whole new audience. Although trading shares of the spot ETH ETF comes with its own set of risks and disadvantages, it undoubtedly has its popularity among traders with specific trading preferences.\n\nKeen to give trading Ether directly a go? Check out our ETH spot trading pairs and ETH price page for more information.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about spot ETH ETFs\n\nIs a spot ETH ETF the same as a spot BTC ETF?\n\nWhile both spot ETFs are tracking the price of their respective cryptocurrencies, they're similar in that they're spot ETFs that'll hold actual ETH and BTC should the ETFs be approved. This will impact their overall price action as compared to futures ETFs, which deal with derivatives of the cryptocurrencies instead of the actual coin.\n\nCan I lose money with a spot ETH ETF?\n\nAs with any crypto trade, this could definitely happen. Since the price of Ether is volatile, your ETH ETF shares can go down in value as the ETF is meant to track the price of ETH.\n\nHow do I choose the right spot ETH ETF?\n\nWhen comparing among the different ETH ETFs, it's key to consider factors like expense ratios, underlying ETH holdings, and assets under management.\n\nWhat happens if the SEC rejects spot ETH ETFs?\n\nIf rejected, it could delay wider adoption but wouldn't necessarily eliminate the possibility of future approval. If you're planning to trade ETH based on this, it's important to stay informed about regulatory developments.\n\nCan I just buy Ether instead of the spot ETH ETF?\n\nYes, you might find buying ETH more convenient if you're already a crypto native. In our opinion, the spot ETH ETF has a different target audience and makes it easier for TradFi traders to gain exposure to the Ethereum ecosystem."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a sudden market shake-up, over $170 million worth of Solan, Bitcoin and Ethereum were liquidated, as depicted by the latest crypto liquidation data. This flash-crash event has rattled the crypto sphere, occurring just a week before the New Year \u2014 a time when such volatility is not typically unexpected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe end-of-year period often sees a shift in market behavior. Retail investors are known to cash out for the holidays, and larger investors close their positions to avoid unpredictable swings during times of reduced liquidity. The liquidation data reflects this trend, showing a substantial number of positions being wiped out in the face of rapid price movements.\n\nOrder books tend to thin out during the holiday season, with reduced trading volumes and some market makers stepping back, increasing the potential for volatility spikes. This environment can lead to quick and severe market movements, as currently evidenced on the crypto market.\n\nDespite this, the overall market still exhibits signs of an uptrend. The $170 million in liquidations, while significant, is not indicative of a market downturn but rather a typical response to the year-end climate. It is a pattern familiar to seasoned crypto enthusiasts, where the combination of profit-taking and risk aversion can momentarily disrupt the market.\n\nHistorically, as the New Year begins and normal trading volumes resume, the market stabilizes. The situation usually improves by mid-January, once institutional and individual investors return to their desks to reengage with the market.\n\nLooking at the broader picture, the uptrend trajectory remains intact. The recent liquidations, although impactful, are unlikely to derail the general market direction. The crypto ecosystem is known for its resilience, and the current liquidation wave is just another test of this attribute."

In his latest YouTube video, Davis dives deep into the untapped potential of Ethereum, emphasizing that the path to riches in the Ethereum ecosystem is not as straightforward as one might think.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Trajectory: More Than Just Numbers\n\nWhile Davis acknowledges Ethereum\u2019s potential to reach between $10,000 to $15,000, marking substantial gains, he stresses that simply buying and holding Ethereum isn\u2019t the golden ticket to wealth. With Ethereum\u2019s price currently at $2,295, investors might see up to a 600% return, which is impressive, but Davis suggests there are even more lucrative opportunities to explore.\n\nThe real financial game-changers lie in Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions \u2013 networks built on top of Ethereum to enhance its scalability and efficiency. He highlights that these Layer 2 platforms, such as StarkNet, ZK Sync, and others, are hotbeds for potential explosive growth, much greater than Ethereum\u2019s main asset itself.\n\nA New Era of Opportunities\n\nDavis points out that new token listings on these Layer 2 networks are critical areas to watch. He uses Celestia as an example, which saw a 500% increase in value within a month of its listing. For those seeking significant returns in a short period, paying attention to these new listings could be key.\n\nFurthermore, Davis emphasizes the potential of airdrops in the Layer 2 space. He shares insights on how to participate in these airdrops, like those from Manta Network and zkSync, by engaging in on-chain activities and staking. These airdrops could be lucrative, offering more immediate and potentially higher returns than traditional investments in ETH.\n\nAt press time, the largest altcoin was worth $2,295. Several experts are projecting a spike to $2,500 in the next five days before the year is over. Currently, Ethereum weekly and daily charts are both in the green, with the Fear and Greed index tilted on Greed, signifying the bulls\u2019 strength. Moreover, Ether is expected to be among the leaders of next year\u2019s anticipated bull run."

        "content": "Despite facing challenges in surpassing the psychological barrier of $2,500, Ethereum (ETH) might witness a similar outlook by the end of the year. This is suggested by BlockchainCenter\u2019s Ethereum rainbow price chart, reflecting momentum in the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn particular, specific cryptocurrency traders and investors leverage Ethereum\u2019s rainbow chart to analyze the historical trends of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. They examine its relationship with various moving averages (MAs) and identify patterns that can inform more informed investment decisions.\n\nThe chart indicates that Ethereum is presently situated in the \u2018Still Cheap\u2019 phase, represented by the light green color. It fluctuates within the range of $1,597 to $2,306, residing below the \u2018Hold\u2019 yellow zone spanning $2,302 to $3,342, based on information observed by Finbold on December 27.\n\nEthereum rainbow price chart. Source: BlockchainCenter\n\nProjection for January 1, 2024\n\nAs for the start of the following year, no significant fluctuations in price are expected, as Ethereum is treading the fine line between the \u2018Still Cheap\u2019 and \u2018Hold\u2019 territories, which both present a buying opportunity for investors.\n\nHowever, an alternative Ethereum Rainbow Chart tool created by CoinCodex projects that, under identical circumstances, the asset price could linger at approximately $3,033 per token should ETH stay within the \u2018HODL\u2019 zone in January 2024.\n\nEthereum rainbow price chart. Source: CoinCodex.com\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAt the time of press, Ethereum is being traded at $2,247.29; this reflects a 0.40% increase for the day, coupled with an upside of 1.75% over the past week and a 9.83% gain on its monthly chart.\n\nETH 30-day price chart.

A summary of the indicators indicates a \u2018buy\u2019 rating at 11, with moving averages signaling a \u2018buy\u2019 at 9. Oscillators tend toward a \u2018neutral\u2019 rating of 8.\n\nEthereum technical analysis.

        "content": "Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin proposed three methods to address a possible \u201csystemic complexity\u201d stemming from the network\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus design.\n\nIn a Dec. 27 post on Ethereum\u2019s research forum, Buterin outlined his ideas for solving a budding pain point caused by increasing network validators and cryptographic signatures required for each blockchain slot.\n\nA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 27, 2023\n\nThe first way works through incentivizing mergers between validators teams by raising the minimum Ether (ETH) needed to run an Ethereum validator. This method revolves around the network\u2019s decentralized staking pools.\n\nSecondly, Buterin suggested dividing staking layers into two. One layer would feature stricter parameters, while the other would offer more flexible conditions. Both layers would be independent and operate under slightly separate blockchain rules aligned with Ethereum\u2019s ethos.\n\nButerin\u2019s third way proposed a mechanism to randomize a set of validators from a pool of network participants. A different basket of these teams would sign each slot, thus maintaining the 8192 signatures currently needed. This is the most complex alternative, according to Ethereum\u2019s co-founder.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum long-term holders hit record numbers, surpassing Bitcoin\n\nEthereum validators have more than doubled since The Merge in September 2022, going from around 430,000 to over 895,000. This increase also means an uptick in signatures needed to perform network operations and maintain Ethereum.\n\nUpcoming upgrades like Dencun may also elevate the required signatures, adding extra load, which Buterin hopes to avoid. Buterin previously shared his thoughts on improving decentralization by revamping staking on Ethereum and raised concerns about restaking services. The developer additionally warned against DAOs operating staking pool nodes.\n\nEthereum validator count | Source: beaconcha.in\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s recent surge in momentum encountered a significant obstacle upon reaching a pivotal resistance area, encompassing the upper boundary of a multi-month wedge and the static resistance at $2.4K.\n\nDespite this, the emergence of a head and shoulders pattern suggests an impending retracement towards the $2K support zone.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nEthereum witnessed a robust uptrend, achieving an annual peak of $2.4K, underscoring the prevailing influence of buyers in the market. This upward trajectory is further emphasized by a golden cross on the daily chart, signaling an overall bullish sentiment for Ethereum.\n\nHowever, the ascent was impeded upon encountering a critical resistance zone formed by the upper boundary of the multi-month wedge coinciding with the crucial static support at $2.4K. The resultant heightened selling pressure put a halt to the existing bullish momentum.\n\nDespite these challenges, a potential head and shoulders pattern, a widely recognized bearish reversal formation, has taken shape. The price is teetering on the brink of breaking below the pattern\u2019s neckline, represented by the orange line. Additionally, an extended bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator suggests the potential for downward movement in the coming days.\n\nConsidering recent price developments, a breach below the neckline of the pattern could pave the way for a short-term downward movement. The anticipated retracement would likely lead the price back toward the substantial support range at $2K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nA closer inspection of the 4-hour chart reveals that amid recent sideways movement, the price found robust support within the critical range between the 0.5 ($2,211) and 0.618 ($2,166) levels of the Fibonacci retracement indicator. It acted as a barrier, preventing further downward attempts.\n\nNotably, this essential support range aligns with a dynamic, supportive trendline, adding additional strength against Ethereum sellers. Nevertheless, a scenario in which sellers gain control and push the price below these crucial support levels could trigger a notable cascade, prompting a retracement towards the $2K support region.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nIn the realm of on-chain data analysis, delving into the sentiment reflected in the futures market provides valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s overall outlook. The accompanying chart depicts Ethereum\u2019s open interest metric. Traditionally, heightened values signify increased volatility and the potential for market reversals, whereas lower values indicate a more sustainable trend.\n\nThe chart underscores that bullish market movements often coincide with a gradual uptick in the Open Interest metric. However, reaching elevated levels or experiencing steep surges could signal the potential for a significant market reversal, often attributed to long/short squeeze events.\n\nThe open interest has been trending upward, albeit not yet reaching the values witnessed during the market\u2019s significant highs. Consequently, while corrections remain a plausible scenario, the futures market is yet to reach a point of overheating. The ongoing bullish trend is likely to endure in the long term, given the moderate levels of open interest. It becomes imperative to closely monitor this metric to discern any potential shifts in market sentiment."

        "title": "Forget High Gas Fee Challenges, Ethereum Remains Bullish: Time To Buy More? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Despite concerns over network congestion and high gas fees, Ethereum remains bullish in the long term, according to borovik.eth\u2013a partner at Rollbit, who posted on X on December 26. The key factors driving the positive outlook are pointing to Ethereum\u2019s developer ecosystem, its role in the broader blockchain ecosystem, and the launch of numerous Layer-2 solutions (L2s).\n\nWill Layer-2 Activity Drive ETH To New Highs?\n\nBorovik.eth remained deviant and optimistic about ETH, even with Solana (OSL) and other layer-1 coins like Cardano (ADA) soaring in 2023. In the analyst\u2019s view, Ethereum\u2019s scaling challenges are manageable, believing that developers will find ways of \u201cresolving this concern permanently over the long term.\u201d\n\nBased on this optimism, the Rollbit partner believes that ETH will likely recover strongly in the coming sessions considering the level of development, especially of layer-2 scaling options meant for the pioneer smart contract platform. According to Borovik.eth, the development of layer-2 off-chain options backed by massive companies, for instance, Coinbase, a crypto exchange, and venture capitalists (VCs), positions Ethereum (ETH) favorably for a bull run.\n\nAs of December 26, ETH remains in an uptrend but is cooling off after solid gains in Q4 2023. At spot rates, ETH is underperforming most layer-1 platforms like Injective Protocol (INJ) and Solana (SOL), whose prices rallied, reaching new 2023 highs. ETH prices are still trending below $2,400, a critical resistance level. If bulls overcome this line, ETH may fly towards $3,500 or better in the months ahead.\n\nThe spike in SOL\u2019s valuation, especially in H2 2023, has led to a comparison with ETH. Even so, most traders are optimistic. Arthur Hayes recently stated that users should begin rotating funds from SOL to ETH, an endorsement of the second most valuable coin by market cap.\n\nEthereum Layer-2s Manage Over $18.8 Billion\n\nWhile Ethereum faces challenges around on-chain scaling, developers have been working hard to resolve this issue. The release of layer-2 off-chain options using rollups has been key in this drive. Most of these solutions, including Arbitrum and Optimism, have been critical in alleviating pressure from the mainnet, thus reducing gas fees. According to L2Beat, layer-2 protocols manage over $18 billion as total value locked (TVL). There are also 34 active projects, with 23 more being developed.\n\nAmong the big companies hitching the layer-2 ride is Coinbase, where through Base, users can transact cheaply while relying on the Ethereum mainnet for security. According to Borovik.eth, over 60% of Base\u2019s revenue is from rollup fees charged, highlighting the importance of their scaling solution and the role Ethereum plays in all this.\n\nRelated Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Moves $45 Million In SHIB, Bullish?\n\nThe upcoming Dencun Upgrade set for integration next year will further slash layer-2 fees. Developers plan to release this update in the Goerli test network as early as mid-January 2024.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Crypto Analyst Lark Davis Predicts Ethereum Price to Surge to $15,000 in 2024 \u2014 Here\u2019s the Latest\n\nCryptocurrency analyst Lark Davis has predicted that Ethereum will reach a price of $15,000 per coin in the upcoming bull cycle of 2024-2025.\n\nDespite the asset\u2019s relatively subdued performance this year, Davis foresees a significant upswing that could potentially yield substantial gains for investors.\n\nIn a video published on X on December 25, Davis explained that the anticipated surge would not be triggered through buying, selling, or staking but rather through Ethereum layer-2 assets.\n\nEthereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think pic.twitter.com/00YCLPyGCl \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 25, 2023\n\nThe YouTuber also delved into the current and upcoming layer-2 listings, including zkSync, Starknet, Linea, Scroll, Blast, Manta, and Celestia. He highlighted the potential for short-term profits associated with these new listings.\n\nWhile acknowledging the historical pump-and-dump patterns observed in newly launched tokens, Davis pointed out instances where tokens gained significant traction after being listed on major exchanges.\n\nDespite presenting potential opportunities, Davis offered a cautious outlook for Ethereum in 2024. Drawing comparisons with historical gains, he predicted substantial growth if Ethereum replicates or slightly surpasses its previous cycle\u2019s highs, which reached around $4,800 in November 2021.\n\nFollowing its all-time high, ETH experienced a notable 81% decline during the bear cycle, reaching its lowest point at $880 on June 18, 2022.\n\nSubsequently, Ethereum embarked on a recovery trajectory, predominantly exhibiting an upward trend throughout 2023. This culminated in a noteworthy high of $2,400 on December 9 and a press time price of $2,367.\n\nHowever, Davis cautioned that individuals entering the market at the current Ethereum price may only experience significant gains if they make substantial investments.\n\nSOL Poised to Be the Better Asset\n\n\n\nThe price of SOL, the native cryptocurrency of the smart-contract-enabled layer-1 Solana blockchain protocol, has surged significantly, surpassing the $118 mark and reaching its highest value in eighteen months. As of December 27, the asset\u2019s price stood at $108.59.\n\nThis notable uptick coincided with a surge in gas fees within the Ethereum ecosystem, where transaction costs briefly spiked above $10. Some users even reported fees as high as $150 for transactions worth only $50 on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAlthough Ethereum gas fees have since decreased by 50% from the week\u2019s peak, users have actively explored alternative blockchain platforms with lower transaction costs, leading to increased activity on Solana.\n\nMessari\u2019s December 14 report further highlights a staggering 400% increase in active addresses on Solana in the last three months, compared to Ethereum\u2019s 3%.\n\nIn Q4 alone, active addresses on Solana have increased by nearly 400% compared to a mere 3% increase on Ethereum. Dive into the report \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/70XuVFgax0 \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) December 18, 2023\n\nSolana\u2019s appeal is underscored by its consistently low fees, averaging less than $0.01, according to CoinCodex\u2019s recent report.\n\nFurthermore, the platform has recorded a positive trend in fund flows. Solana-based investment funds attracted $10.6 million in the week ending December 16, surpassing inflows into major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nIn December alone, Solana funds saw inflows of $14.1 million, marking the highest in the cryptocurrency sector. Currently, SOL\u2019s trajectories outpace those of ETH, suggesting its potential as a superior asset for a significant surge in the upcoming bull run next year.\n\nHowever, this swift ascent prompts a crucial question within the crypto community: Is the remarkable rise in Solana\u2019s value a fleeting occurrence, or does it mark the commencement of a new era in its market dominance?\n\nThe answer is entwined in a complex interplay of market trends, investor sentiment, and the evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSolana's co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently made a bold assertion about the future of blockchain interoperability and the role of Solana in the wider Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIn a series of posts on the X social media platform, Yakovenko described Solana as an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution through the Wormhole EigenLayer.\n\nThis would be possible because of advancements in \"danksharding,\" a scaling solution for Ethereum, suggesting a future where Solana blocks could be submitted into a data-validating bridge contract on Ethereum.\n\nExploring interoperability\n\nYakovenko's comments sparked a discussion about the technicalities and implications of such an integration.\n\nHe clarified that Solana would only mint the wrapped version in its state after Ethereum achieves full finality, addressing concerns about potential reorganizations (reorgs) of the blockchain.\n\nThe concept of \"social consensus\" was emphasized, which suggests flexibility in how Solana and Ethereum might interact.\n\nThis flexibility could allow users to fork off into their own layer-1 1 (L1) blockchain, using a snapshot root. Yakovenko's stance indicates a broader view of what defines a layer-2 solution, challenging traditional boundaries and proposing a more fluid and interconnected blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSolana's market resurgence\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Solana has recently marked a significant achievement by surpassing Ethereum in a key trading metric: perpetual futures trading volume.\n\nSolana's lead in both perpetual futures and spot trading volumes, coupled with a soaring market capitalization, positions it as a formidable competitor in the crypto space, even challenging Ethereum's dominance in the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors.\n\nThe interest in the Solana ecosystem mostly stems from the meme coin frenzy that was fueled by the rise of the Bonk (BONK) token."

        "content": "In the end, Ethereum's recent rally and its proximity to a significant resistance level underscore the cryptocurrency's potential for further gains.\n\nEthereum embarked on a robust rally during Friday's trading session, signaling a potential for further upward momentum.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is on the cusp of breaking through a substantial resistance level, a development that warrants keen observation.\n\nSpecifically, if Ethereum manages to breach the $2,400 mark, it could set the stage for a push toward the psychologically significant $2,500 threshold, which often garners the close attention of traders.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nThe prospect of resistance at the $2,500 level should not be dismissed, but in the broader context, prevailing market dynamics are more influenced by interest rates than isolated price points. Below the current price action, the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average and the $2,100 level jointly provide robust support. Furthermore, the decreasing interest rates in the United States are rendering riskier assets like cryptocurrencies increasingly appealing. As a result, traders are inclined to seize value opportunities whenever they materialize.\n\nETH and BTC Intertwined\n\nConsidering the overarching landscape, it is apparent that Ethereum's fortunes are closely intertwined with those of Bitcoin, the dominant player in the crypto realm. As Bitcoin experiences an upward surge, Ethereum tends to follow suit, as we have seen multiple times in the past. However, it is essential to remain vigilant regarding the trajectory of interest rates, as a sudden rise could pose a substantial headwind to the Ethereum market.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the prevailing scenario suggests a continued upward pressure on Ethereum. The overarching sentiment appears bullish, with Bitcoin leading the way. Nonetheless, it is prudent to acknowledge that liquidity may become somewhat constrained in the coming days as market participants shift their focus from trading to the festivities of the holiday season.\n\nWhat sets Ethereum apart during this period is its active trading during the Christmas and New Year's Day sessions, in contrast to many traditional financial markets that observe closures. This distinction affords Ethereum traders unique opportunities to navigate the market dynamics during these holidays.\n\nIn the end, Ethereum's recent rally and its proximity to a significant resistance level underscore the cryptocurrency's potential for further gains. While potential obstacles exist, the prevailing narrative points toward continued upward momentum, driven by the interplay of market dynamics and interest rates. As the holiday season approaches, Ethereum's active trading status sets it apart in the crypto world, offering opportunities for traders even amidst the holiday festivities.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD?

        "content": "Ethereum saw a drop in the Estimated Leverage Ratio.\n\nIn combination with other metrics, the inference was that bullish certainty was falling.\n\nIn a report last week, AMBCrypto highlighted that Ethereum [ETH] has underperformed Bitcoin [BTC] in recent weeks.\n\nComparing their performance in December, AMBCrypto found that ETH has gained 11.3% at press time, while BTC has gained 14.8%.\n\nThis meant that market participants had a valid reason to question their short-term ETH holdings. Evidence for this was present in the form of a dropping Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR), AMBCrypto found.\n\nThis metric warranted a closer look and could reveal what the market expects for Ethereum over the next month.\n\nThe ELR has trended lower for a while now\n\nAs the name suggests, the ELR is an estimation that divides the exchange\u2019s Open Interest with the exchange\u2019s coin reserve to approximate the average leverage employed by users.\n\nThis metric generally trends higher during bullish market conditions, when market participants are encouraged to assume more risk in search of gains during a trending market.\n\nThe ELR chart from CryptoQuant showed that the metric has trended higher since the first week of September. Around that time, ETH dipped to $1531 but bounced higher and began to rally.\n\nOn the 8th of December, the 14-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the ELR began to drop. At press time, this dip was still in progress. This meant that users were less willing to assume risk.\n\nThey might also be pivoting to long-term holding strategies.\n\nTo better understand what is happening, AMBCrypto looked at other metrics. One of them was the Ethereum Exchange Inflow. A rising ELR alongside a rise in the inflows would be a strong signal that participants were bearish on ETH.\n\nOn the 11th and the 18th of December, the inflow metric saw a spike in the readings. This represented a large amount of ETH entering exchanges. Looking at the 14-day SMA, we can see that it has trended upward.\n\nCombined with the depressed ELR, it is a sign that selling pressure has been on the rise over the past two weeks.\n\nWhat is the market sentiment like?\n\nThe Open Interest is a good gauge of market sentiment. Trending prices and a rising OI are strong signals that market participants have expectations of further gains and are positioned long in the market.\n\nAs we can see, the OI has also trended higher from mid-September. In particular, the uptrend in prices and OI in October and early December came alongside rising prices, signaling a firm bullish conviction.\n\nHowever, after the 9th of December, we see the 14-day SMA of Ethereum\u2019s OI slide lower. Despite the OI spike on the 22nd of December, the trend appeared to be pointed lower.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nFrom a technical perspective, ETH bulls faced a massive challenge when attempting to convert the $2300-$2370 area to a support zone.\n\nThe inference from the metrics was that Ethereum\u2019s bullish momentum was likely slowing down. The belief in ETH has eroded over the past ten days. It remains to be seen whether ETH bears can force prices to fall below the $2132 support level."

This level has not only provided support in the past but has also demonstrated resistance to buying pressure. Market participants are likely to bear in mind this historical significance, potentially presenting an attractive opportunity for value-oriented investors. On the upside, the $2500 level looms large, and a successful breach of this level could pave the way for a move toward the $3000 mark. Over the longer term, there is potential for Ethereum to reach the $3500 level. However, the immediate future is likely to be marked by choppy, back-and-forth price movements.\n\nIn terms of strategy, a prudent approach would involve buying the dips, but doing so incrementally rather than diving headfirst into the market. The next few sessions could be characterized by unusual price movements, making it essential to exercise caution. Nevertheless, Ethereum appears to have a bullish outlook in the long run, especially as interest rates in the United States continue to decline. This decline in interest rates has historically been favorable for the broader cryptocurrency market. As traders become more willing to embrace risk, Ethereum stands to benefit. Ethereum holds a unique position within the market as the foundation for numerous tokens and ecosystems built upon its platform.

The DeFi protocol running on Ethereum, Solana, and other chains has been threatened by the exploiter of potentially deleting users\u2019 private keys\u2019 data, although the team denied the possibility, reassuring the safety of assets.\n\nCrypto trading protocol Thunder hacked\n\nCrypto trading protocol Thunder took to X, formerly Twitter, to confirm a suspected exploit on December 27. The team addressed the suspicious withdrawals that began early in the morning and put a halt to the same in the next nine minutes.\n\nThe hacker still managed to steal 86.5 ETH and 439 SOL, collectively worth over $239,000. According to Thunder, the exploiter managed to gain access to a MongoDB connection URL, which they used to pull session tokens and execute withdrawals on behalf of users.\n\nWhile the team behind the protocol stated that 114 out of the 14,000 wallets on the platform were affected, the exploiter noted that they held the user data concerning private keys and intended to delete them.\n\nThunder exploiter\u2019s threat\n\nThis threat was discredited by the Thunder team, which stated,\n\n\u201cNo private keys nor wallets were compromised\u2026We do not store any private keys, so the attacker does not have access to any wallets. Desktop wallets were not affected. Less than 1% of wallets on our platform were affected as a result of this attack.\n\nFurthermore, the team stated that they are already communicating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and are willing to negotiate with the exploiter, failure of which would lead to them taking legal action.\n\nWe have taken the following actions:\n\n- Our legal team and the FBI have been contacted.\n\n- We are now undergoing a full, technical audit.\n\n- We are working on adding 2FA immediately for withdrawals.\n\n- We are adding additional security regarding session issuing.\n\n- We know which\u2026 \u2014 Thunder (@ThunderTerminal) December 27, 2023\n\nLastly, users were reassured of the safety of their assets, and the ones affected were notified with the team claiming that the lost funds would be refunded in full and the users would be given 0% fees and $100,000 in credits.\n\nThe Thunder exploit could be the last exploit of 2023, which has already seen the theft of more than $2 billion worth of assets, with the largest attack witnessed by blockchain security consultancy firm Mixin Network, resulting in the loss of over $200 million worth of digital assets."

        "content": "The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism at the core of Ethereum, according to co-founder Vitalik Buterin, may face systemic complexity. To address this, he has three solutions.\n\n\u201cA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter,\u201d he wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe primary problem is that to keep the network functioning properly, validators that maintain it must create a large number of digital signatures using encryption.\n\nThe network already has a lot of work to handle from this, but as additional validators join, the number of signatures will rise, adding to the system\u2019s workload. Subsequent updates are expected to raise the required signatures even more dramatically.\n\nOn December 27, Buterin wrote a post to the Ethereum Research forum outlining three approaches to avoid this. The shared goal is to reduce the number of signatures needed for each Ethereum blockchain space to 8,192.\n\nThe first solution is centered on decentralized staking pools. This would need raising the minimum amount of ether needed to run a validator to force people running validators to collaborate and pool their resources.\n\nVitalik\u2019s second solution is to have two layers of stakeholders, one with stricter criteria and the other with more lax ones would be the second strategy. During the block finalization process, the two levels would be used in distinct ways.\n\nThe third option would be to have a rotating group of participants, in which case a different group of validators is chosen at random for each slot. Although Buterin pointed out that it would increase complexity, this would divide out the workload and lower the overall number of signatures."

        "content": "As Ethereum Classic (ETC) has been gearing up for a \u2018Spiral\u2019 upgrade, Monero(XMR) is preparing for \u2018Monero Meet Up 2023.\u2019 However, with its amazing presale run, Borroe Finance ($ROE) looks like a bright prospect for financial success. Which is the top crypto to buy now\u2013ETC, XMR, or $ROE? Let\u2019s explore more.\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum Classic Announces Spiral Upgrade Amid Price Fall\n\nOn December 5, Ethereum Classic announced that the ETC network is gearing up for a \u2018Spiral\u2019 Upgrade, which is set to be activated at block 19,250,000. This upgrade will align the Ethereum Classic chain with the Ethereum mainnet, ensuring EVM compatibility.\n\nFollowing the announcement by Ethereum Classic, ETC experienced a notable surge in price, climbing from $19.55 to $22.85 on December 9. Despite this uptick, Ethereum Classic\u2019s positive momentum was short-lived. Then ETC again retraced to $20.02, representing a 2.40% increase on December 19 since the announcement.\n\nAs ETC faced rejection at the $23.50 resistance level, Ethereum Classic faced a downturn. Also, the technical indicator of Ethereum Classic, like MACD, displays a rising red histogram, prompting stronger selling pressure in ETC. This led to a mixed pattern where ETC\u2019s bulls lost confidence, and bearish influence started to take over Ethereum Classic.\n\nMany crypto analysts speculate that this upgrade will fuel the return of the Ethereum Classic. If bulls gain momentum, ETC might surge up to $22.50 by the end of 2023. Thus, many investors consider it the best crypto investment for the short term.\n\nCape Town to Host Exclusive Monero Event\n\nOn December 13, Monero revealed on X about their upcoming \u201cMonero Meet Up 2023\u201d, which is to be held in Cape Town on December 22. Monero invites all their developers, users, enthusiasts, and anyone else interested in XMR.\n\nBesides that, Monero has been performing well in December. With a bullish outlook on Monero\u2019s network, XMR has become one of the best coins to invest in as its bearish trend reverses. Since the start of the month, the XMR price has been consolidated between $165 and $180.\n\nOn December 19, XMR was trading around $170, marking a 0.57% increase in the past seven days. However, Monero\u2019s technical analysis reveals that XMR will have a strong bearish influence in the upcoming market. The MACD on the Monero chart shows a red histogram, suggesting a bearish trend streak for XMR.\n\nYet, crypto analysts say if the bulls gain power back and hold above $170, then XMR is likely to surge over $185. But, if XMR fails, the altcoin price is likely to drop to $155. Crypto analysts suggest caution before taking a position in XMR.\n\nBorroe Finance Presale Catches Investors\u2019 Eyes\n\nBorroe Finance, one of the new DeFi projects, is an AI-powered funding marketplace. Interestingly, Borroe Finance has already raised over $2 million, selling more than 177 million $ROE tokens.\n\nBorroe Finance\u2019s unique value proposition has made $ROE one of the most demanding tokens.

        "title": "Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Technical Analysis Predicts Potential ETH Rise - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Technical analysis suggests possible upside for Ethereum versus Bitcoin, with rising wedge patterns indicating an imminent rebound.\n\nEthereum could experience a significant rise against Bitcoin, marking a potential shift in crypto market dynamics.\n\nThe current dynamics between Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) in the cryptocurrency market suggest a potential turnaround for Ethereum. According to recent technical analysis, Ethereum could be setting up for significant appreciation against Bitcoin. This analysis provides a detailed perspective on the possible price trends of Ethereum versus Bitcoin and their implications for cryptocurrency investors.\n\nEthereum Versus Bitcoin: Favorable Technical Indicators\n\nBased on the rising wedge pattern developing on the daily chart of Ether versus Bitcoin, there is an increasing likelihood of a breakout move before the New Year. This classic bullish reversal pattern , characterized by the formation of lower highs and higher lows with two converging trendlines, would resolve with a breakout above the upper trendline and a rise to a level equal to the maximum distance between the upper and lower trendlines.\n\nETH/BTC Near a Falling Wedge Breakout\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair is currently trading within a similar descending wedge pattern, looking to break its upper trend line. Depending on the breakout point, the pair could rise towards the 0.056-0.059 BTC area by the New Year, which would represent a 6-13% increase from current price levels.\n\nLonger-term charts suggest the possibility of a rebound by the New Year and during the first quarter of 2024. For example, Ether\u2019s price is forming lower highs while its relative strength index (RSI) is making higher lows on the weekly chart, indicating a bullish divergence. This discrepancy suggests that bearish momentum is weakening and a reversal to the upside could be imminent.\n\nIn addition, price is also near a confluence of support comprising a multi-year uptrend line and the 0.048-0.052 BTC area. This confluence limits the bearish outlook for the ETH/BTC pair in the coming weeks, allowing for a bounce towards the 200-week EMA (the blue wave) near 0.057 BTC by the New Year, which is also the aforementioned target of the descendingwedge.\n\nPossible Alternative Scenarios\n\nHowever, veteran trader Peter Brandt disagrees and argues that the mentioned descending wedge pattern could be a descending triangle, a bearish indicator. In this regard, Brandt suggests that a break below the lower trend line of the descending wedge could take the ETH/BTC pair towards 0.044 BTC, which would be an 8.5% drop from current price levels.\n\nImplications for Cryptocurrency Investors\n\nThis divergence of opinion among analysts highlights the speculative and highly volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. Investors should carefully consider these analyses and be prepared for the possibility of price fluctuations. While some indicators suggest upside potential for Ethereum versus Bitcoin, others warn of the possibility of continued bearish performance.\n\nAnalysis of the ETH/BTC ratio offers valuable insight into current trends in the cryptocurrency market. As Ethereum and Bitcoin continue to be leaders in the crypto space, their price dynamics are crucial to understanding the overall direction of the market. With multiple factors at play, investors must remain informed and adapt their investment strategies to navigate this ever-evolving market.\n\n."
