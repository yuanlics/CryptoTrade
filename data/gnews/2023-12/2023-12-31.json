        "title": "Ethereum Improvement Proposals to watch in 2024 - Blockworks",
        "content": "The latest Ethereum All Core Developers meeting finally put some tentative dates on the upgrade schedule for the next mainnet hard fork, Dencun.\n\nWith the caveat that it\u2019s only \u201cif no major issues arise,\u201d Ethereum devs are eyeing the following dates for forking Ethereum\u2019s public testnets:\n\nGoerli: Jan. 17\n\nSepolia: Jan. 30\n\nHolesky: Feb. 7\n\nThis will be the last time that Goerli is included in the testing regimen, as the network is slated for deprecation.\n\nThey also discussed what comes next \u2014 the as-yet-un-nicknamed Prague/Electra upgrade. The Ethereum community is considering whether to focus on a large core feature \u2014 which could take a year of work \u2014 or structure the upgrade around multiple smaller improvements, which could be feasible for late 2024.\n\nA decision will come in the new year, but for now, here are some of the improvements to watch in 2024 in the wake of Dencun:\n\nEIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding)\n\nThis is the big kahuna among Dencun EIPs, which were the focus of many news stories in 2023.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade to focus on blobs\n\nThe upgrade \u201cwill reduce the cost of data availability across all layer-2s,\u201d StarkWare co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson told Blockworks. \u201cSo that\u2019s something that Starknet is very much anticipating so that users can have lower costs.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s at the \u201cforefront\u201d of what Lucas Henning, chief technology officer of Web3 wallet developer Suku, calls \u201ca year of groundbreaking improvements for Ethereum.\u201d\n\n\u201c[EIP-4844 is] a transformational enhancement\u201d that will slash rollups gas fees \u201cby up to 100x,\u201d Henning told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: Core devs rule out Dencun fork this year\n\nAccount abstraction comes into its own\n\nAlso at the top of Henning\u2019s mind are improvements taking advantage of account abstraction: ERC-4337 and its extension, ERC-6900.\n\nERCs are a subset of EIPs focusing specifically on token standards within the Ethereum ecosystem. They define rules for token implementations to ensure interoperability. Unlike some EIPs that modify the core protocol, ERCs typically don\u2019t require a hard fork.\n\nERC-4337 went live in March and the concept of account abstraction \u201cwill play a pivotal role as the most significant changes for the end-user,\u201d Henning said.\n\n\u201cAccount abstraction is set to revolutionize the way we perceive and interact with wallets, making gasless transactions the standard and secure social logins the new norm, fundamentally reshaping the Ethereum user experience,\u201d he said.\n\nTraditionally, Ethereum has two types of accounts: externally owned accounts (EOAs) controlled by private keys and contract accounts controlled by their code. Account abstraction blurs this distinction, allowing users to create accounts that behave more like smart contracts.\n\nIt can enhance both user experience and security, and allows for more complex account logic, such as multisig wallets or social recovery of lost keys.\n\nERC-6900, introduced the concept of \u201cdelegated transactions.\u201d This standard, which also did not require changes to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet consensus, allows users to delegate the ability to send transactions on their behalf, for instance, to make one approval for a batch of actions to save time and hassle.\n\nEIP-1153 (transient storage opcodes)\n\nThis proposal, part of Dencun, aims to introduce a new mechanism for handling temporary or transient storage during smart contract execution.\n\nTraditional storage operations on Ethereum are permanent and consume gas. This can be inefficient for temporary data that doesn\u2019t need to persist for longer than one transaction.\n\nEIP-1153 is an opcode (operational code) that would allow smart contracts to use transient storage \u2014 storage that would be wiped clean at the end of transaction execution.\n\nThe Uniswap team lobbied for 1153 to be included, and wanted it already in Shapella, but they couldn\u2019t rally enough support to reach consensus among the core developers. The upgrade is expected to play a significant role in enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Uniswap\u2019s upcoming v4 protocol.\n\nRead more: What has Uniswap Labs cooked up for v4?\n\nBy enabling temporary storage, EIP-1153 can reduce the gas costs associated with storing data during contract execution and provide developers more flexibility in designing smart contracts.\n\nAnd by reducing the burden on permanent storage and minimizing state bloat, EIP-1153 can contribute to the overall scalability of the Ethereum network.\n\nEIP-4788 (Beacon block root commits)\n\nImagine Ethereum as a vast library with two main sections: the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) section, which is like the reading room where people come to read books (execute smart contracts), and the Beacon Chain section, which is like the library\u2019s catalog system, keeping track of all the books and their locations (consensus and coordination of the Ethereum network).\n\nBefore EIP-4788, these two sections functioned somewhat independently. The EVM section doesn\u2019t have direct access to the up-to-date catalog; it has to rely on indirect methods to understand what\u2019s happening in the Beacon Chain section.\n\nEIP-4788 proposes to put a \u201cBeacon Block Root\u201d (a summary or hash tree root of the parent block) into each EVM block.\n\nIt\u2019s like moving from an outdated card filing system in a library \u2014 inefficient and sometimes inaccurate \u2014 to a system with a real-time, accurate and direct link to the main library database.\n\nIn this modern library, every time a new book is added, moved or removed (the Beacon Chain updates), the readers (EVM) have immediate and accurate information. Readers can trust they\u2019re getting the most current information and the library operations (like executing smart contracts) are more aligned with the overall catalog system (the state of the consensus layer).\n\nAll this happens in a trust-minimized manner, eliminating the need for external oracles to provide this data, and thereby reducing potential points of failure or manipulation.\n\nThis change is particularly beneficial for liquid staking protocols such as Lido, smart contract-based bridges and restaking solutions, as it allows these protocols to access crucial data like validator balances and states directly from the consensus layer, enhancing their security and operational efficiency.\n\nEIP-4788 essentially introduces a protocol-level oracle, relaying Ethereum\u2019s consensus state throughout the mainnet.\n\nMisha Komarov, founder of Nil Foundation, which is deploying a zkOracle for Lido, called it \u201cdefinitely helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need the consensus layer state root within their application logic (right now it is being proven by Casper FFG proof done via zkLLVM to the execution layer within the zkOracle design,\u201d he told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: New Ethereum rollup takes a zero-knowledge approach to sharding\n\nEIP-5656 (MCOPY opcode)\n\nThe EVM operates using a set of opcodes that dictate various operations.\n\nEIP-5656 introduces a new opcode called MCOPY, which is proposed to optimize the process of copying data in memory during the execution of smart contracts.\n\nIn the current EVM architecture, copying large data segments can be inefficient and costly when using existing opcodes. MCOPY offers a more efficient way, one which is expected to reduce the gas fees associated with these operations, while improving performance.\n\nFaster memory operations mean quicker execution of contracts, and developers would have more tools at their disposal to optimize their smart contracts \u2014 particularly when dealing with large data structures or complex operations that involve memory manipulation.\n\nEIP-6780 (restrict SELFDESTRUCT)\n\nIn Ethereum, the SELFDESTRUCT opcode allows a smart contract to delete itself from the blockchain.\n\nWhen executed, it removes the contract\u2019s code and storage from the state and sends the contract\u2019s remaining ether to a specified address.\n\nHowever, this feature has led to several issues, including complexity in state management and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nBy restricting SELFDESTRUCT, Ethereum can better manage its state size, leading to a more stable and predictable blockchain.\n\nThis is crucial for the network\u2019s long-term scalability and maintenance, as it will simplify future Ethereum upgrades.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Shares Ethereum Roadmap For 2024, Focuses on Six Key Components\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has shared the Ethereum roadmap for 2024, outlining the project's continued focus on six main components.\n\nButerin posted on X (formerly Twitter) an updated roadmap with annotations and diagrams, elaborating on each of the six elements: the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge and the Splurge.\n\nButerin noted that as Ethereum's technical direction becomes clearer, there are only a handful of minor adjustments compared to the 2023 roadmap. The Merge, which integrated the Ethereum mainnet with the proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain the Beacon Chain in September 2022, remains a key focus area. Buterin emphasized the importance of maintaining a simple and resilient PoS consensus.\n\nFollowing the Merge, the most significant observation on Ethereum was the transition from a power-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to PoS, leading to a major reduction in the network's overall energy consumption.\n\nButerin also highlighted the developments in Ethereum's single-slot finality (SSF), which aims to ensure that changes to a blockchain block are irreversible without burning at least 33% of the total staked Ether (ETH).\n\nButerin stated:\n\n\"The role of single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge PoS improvement is solidifying. It's becoming clear that SSF is the easiest path to resolving a lot of the Ethereum PoS design's current weaknesses.\"\n\nButerin's roadmap also emphasizes the importance of rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and second-generation privacy solutions, which align with the original cypherpunk principles of Ethereum.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "An analyst has explained that Ethereum could be set to see a further rally based on on-chain data. Here\u2019s the level ETH may end up surpassing.\n\nEthereum Has No Significant On-Chain Resistance Ahead\n\nIn a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed how Ethereum\u2019s support and resistance levels are looking like based on on-chain data. In on-chain analysis, the potential for any level to provide any notable amount of support/resistance to the price depends on the number of investors who acquired their coins.\n\nHere is a chart that shows the amount of ETH that was bought at some of the price ranges that the asset has visited before:\n\nThe density of cost basis at each of the different ETH price ranges | Source: @ali_charts on X\n\nThe graph shows that the $2,235 to $2,302 range carries the cost basis of a significant number of coins. More specifically, 1.84 million addresses acquired more than 6 million ETH inside this range.\n\nCurrently, the Ethereum price is trading just above this range, implying that all these investors are in the green. If the Ethereum spot price retraces into this range, these holders could show some reaction, as their profit-loss boundary would be retested.\n\nSince these holders would have been in profits just before the retest, they might want to buy more, as they may believe that this same price range that was profitable earlier might turn out to be a worthy buy again.\n\nSince the range is thick with investors, this buying effect that may arise on a retest could end up providing support to the price. If the support fails, the price might be between $1,958 and $2,029.\n\nThis range is much more robust, hosting a cost basis of over 37 million ETH. Ali notes that this support could potentially help cushion any corrections that may take place.\n\nNow, Ethereum has strong support below, and as is apparent in the chart, there is no major demand wall above it simultaneously. Investors in loss (those with a cost basis higher than the current spot price) may be desperate to escape the market, so the price rising to their break-even can be an enticing exit opportunity.\n\nIf many holders are sitting at a loss, their demand zone could provide significant resistance to the price because of such selling. ETH has no such obstacles in the nearby price ranges so that the coin could rally further. \u201cThe path ahead of ETH is clear, with no significant supply barriers in sight, suggesting a potential rise to $2,700 or beyond,\u201d explains the analyst.\n\nThe market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has also shared a chart that could provide further evidence for a bullish case of Ethereum.\n\nThe trend in the HODLer ratio for Bitcoin and Ethereum | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nAs is visible in the above graph, the percentage of Ethereum investors who can be classified as \u201cHODLers\u201d (1 year+ holding time) has shot up recently. \u201cThis year, the percent of long-term ETH holders surpassed that of Bitcoin for the second time ever!\u201d notes IntoTheBlock.\n\nETH Price\n\nEthereum is currently at the $2,316 mark, not too far above the support zone mentioned earlier.\n\nLooks like the price of the coin hasn't been moving much recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, IntoTheBlock.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has recently become the focal point of speculation, particularly regarding its potential surge to $10,000 in the upcoming bull run. According to a post by Altcoin Daily on X, Ethereum has the potential to hit $10,000. The bold Ethereum price prediction has sparked a wave of discussions and analysis within the crypto community.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Bullish Run In 2023\n\nAt press time, Ethereum price was trading around the $2,300 range, making Altcoin Daily\u2019s projection a staggering 350% gain. However, other analysts\u2019 projections and technical indicators suggest that hitting this target would take some time. To understand better, let\u2019s summarise Ethereum\u2019s performance in 2023 while looking at the technical aspects of its performance.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn October 2023, the Ethereum price surged beyond $1,800 and surpassed the $2,000 mark in November. Since then, the second-largest crypto has maintained an upward trajectory in December, showcasing an approximately 14% increase. Despite a recent correction, it continues to hover around $2,300 after almost seven months of relatively stagnant performance.\n\nAlso Read: Analyst Predicts 22% Surge In Ethereum (ETH) Price Sparking Market Optimism\n\nETH Price Technical Analysis\n\nA closer look at technical analysis data reveals that Ethereum surpassed December 2023\u2019s Fibonacci pivot R2 level, approaching $2,210, signaling a positive trajectory. However, the brief touch of the R3 level before correction suggests potential volatility. As of now, the technical projections estimate Ethereum to trade between $2,300 and $2,400 by the end of 2023.\n\nWhilst, $2,350 is identified as the immediate goal for 2023 end and support is found between $2,000 and $2,125. Currently, Ethereum\u2019s price is trading well above the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, indicating an upward trajectory. Immediate expectations suggest a rally towards $2,500 towards the beginning of 2024.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2024-2030\n\nFurthermore, ETH price prediction by another renowned analyst paints a compelling picture. In a recent tweet, Rekt Capital, a popular crypto analyst on X, noted that Ethereum could witness a 22% surge if it\u2019s able to regain the $2,274 mark as support. This implies that the ETH price would propel up to more than $2,600.\n\nOn the other hand, the ETH forecasts by Changelly for the period from 2024 to 2030 range between $4,000 to $34,700. The projections hint at a volatile journey marked by bullish surges and significant pullbacks. In conclusion, while the $10,000 mark remains an unrealistic projection for 2024, Ethereum\u2019s current trends and technical analysis indicate a promising performance.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction as New Bearish Pattern Threats a Dive Below $2000"

This expected rise is backed by key metrics and upcoming improvements to Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Records New High! Will ETH Price Hit $2,500 This Week?\n\nEchoing the same sentiment, Raoul Pal, a prominent figure in the crypto space, in his video adds weight to this speculation, predicting a significant uptick in Ethereum\u2019s value. He ties this projection to the advent of an Ethereum ETF, marking a critical catalyst that could propel Ethereum\u2019s market sentiment to all-time highs.\n\nPal highlights, that Buterin\u2019s updated roadmap for Ethereum\u2019s evolution provides a blueprint for the network\u2019s future. It outlines transformative changes such as the implementation of Single Slot Finality (SSF), designed to rectify existing Proof-of-Stake (PoS) design flaws, potentially enhancing transaction speeds and overall security. These strides in scalability, especially through the Surge and rollup enhancements, signal Ethereum\u2019s relentless pursuit of efficiency and broader usability.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin: The 2024 Outlook\n\nWhile Bitcoin has dominated the crypto market recently, many predict Ethereum will lead in 2024. A common view is that Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance will peak before a halving event, paving the way for altcoins like Ethereum to shine. Ethereum\u2019s growing ecosystem, with projects like Arbitrum and Optimism, adds to this optimism. Buterin\u2019s efforts to streamline Ethereum further highlight its potential.\n\nButerin\u2019s plan also addresses challenges within Ethereum\u2019s PoS system. Initiatives like Scourge aim to tackle issues like Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) and stake pooling. Despite facing challenges like Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs), Ethereum\u2019s dedication to improvement remains evident.\n\nThe Journey to $5k\n\nEchoing positive sentiments, Arthur Hayes underscores Ethereum\u2019s rising importance in the crypto landscape. If Ethereum maintains its growth momentum, reaching $5,000 is plausible. Technical measures like RSI and MACD also support Ethereum\u2019s promising path forward.\n\nRead More: Ethereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024 \u2013 Predicts Crypto Expert Lark Davis"

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has shared the Ethereum roadmap for 2024, admitting that there are only minor changes compared to last year.\n\nIn a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Buterin outlined that the continued focus for Ethereum in 2024 is on six main components.\n\nFurthermore, in a detailed chart with annotations and diagrams, Buterin elaborated on these six elements \u2014 the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge and the Splurge.\n\nHe pointed out that, as Ethereum\u2019s technical direction becomes clearer, there are only a handful of minor adjustments compared to 2023\u2019s roadmap:\n\n\u201cAs Ethereum\u2019s technical path forward continues to solidify, there are relatively few changes.\u201d\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nThe Merge was highlighted as a key section on the roadmap, aiming to maintain a simple and resilient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus.\n\nIn September 2022, the Merge took place, which integrated the Ethereum mainnet with the proof-of-stake blockchain the Beacon Chain.\n\nFollowing the merge, the most significant observation on Ethereum was the transition from a power-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to PoS, leading to a major reduction in the network\u2019s overall energy consumption.\n\nHe further noted the developments in Ethereum\u2019s single-slot finality (SSF). Finality aims to ensure that changes to a blockchain block are irreversible without burning at least 33% of the total staked Ether (ETH):\n\n\u201cThe role of single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge PoS improvement is solidifying. It\u2019s becoming clear that SSF is the easiest path to resolving a lot of the Ethereum PoS design\u2019s current weaknesses.\u201d\n\nSingle-slot finality (SSF) diagram. Source: Vitalik Buterin\n\nRelated: Solana flips Ethereum in Google search interest: Data\n\nThis comes after Cointelegraph recently reported that Buterin wants to bring back the original idea of the \u201ccypherpunk\u201d revolution for the blockchain.\n\nCypherpunk refers to a person who uses encryption to ensure privacy when accessing a computer network, especially from government authorities.\n\nIn a blog post, Buterin explained that Ethereum was initially envisioned as a \u201cpublic decentralized shared hard drive\u201d that could leverage peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage.\n\nHowever, the vision started to diminish in 2017 with the turn toward financialization on Ethereum.\n\nButerin highlighted that rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction and second-generation privacy solutions have become more mainstream. He noted that these could support certain values associated with cypherpunk principles.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"

Ali Charts\n\nNearly two million wallets accumulated almost 40 million ETH between $1,900 and $2,020 price ranges, forming a formidable wall against massive market dumps.\n\nEthereum is also scheduled for notable technological upgrades like EIP-7514 and EIP-4844, also referred to as proto-danksharding, which is geared towards enabling more transactions for cheaper gas fees.

        "content": "Ethereum is out and Solana is in.\n\nEthereum, its mess of layer-2s and neverending scaling roadmap are doomed to be usurped by its younger \u201cmonolithic\u201d rival.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what the rabblers on X are saying.\n\nThe sagging ETH-to-BTC ratio surely isn\u2019t helping. Bitcoin has swelled 160% this year, while ETH hasn\u2019t even doubled. Anyone who sold their bitcoin for ether in January would\u2019ve so far lost a quarter of their BTC on that trade.\n\nSolana\u2019s bitcoin ratio is up more than 300%. SOL\u2019s dollar price is now 10 times what it was at the start of the year, although it\u2019s still down almost two-thirds from its record high at the top of the last bull market.\n\nSolana truthers would also point to the network\u2019s cheap fees and engaged community, which have lately inspired a boom in Solana-native NFTs, memecoins and decentralized exchanges. Solana even flipped Ethereum for DEX volume for the first time earlier this month.\n\nProjects are now plotting additional airdrops to incentivize on-chain Solana activity, hinting at far more buzz to come.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Vitalik fans.\n\nAn Ethereum vibecession may have given way to a Solanaissance, but these charts should pick up your spirits.\n\nEthereum\u2019s number has definitely gone up\n\nOne could sift through the minutiae of blockchain tech stacks \u2014 debate the finer points of the appchain thesis and the security concerns surrounding consensus. Or, we could just focus on price.\n\nEther\u2019s earliest recorded price was $3 when it opened trade way back in 2015. ETH now trades for $2,300 \u2014 a 76,000% return over its whole history (not counting the additional gains made on its ICO price).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s all-time returns would completely dwarf ether\u2019s and solana\u2019s. Let\u2019s just pretend they wouldn\u2019t\n\nSolana has done well but not that well, posting a meager 40,000% since its debut in mid-2020, about half ether\u2019s returns.\n\nAnd we all know that markets are always right.\n\nEvery second dollar locked is on Ethereum\n\nCrypto has so many use cases. You can buy other cryptocurrencies with it. You can buy NFTs with it, and maybe some Dallas Mavericks merchandise.\n\nYou can even buy movie tickets or Adidas shoes with crypto \u2014 although you\u2019ll have to send your bitcoin to a payment processor who will dump it for fiat on behalf of the merchant.\n\nIf using crypto as actual money doesn\u2019t appeal, you could always lock it up in a blockchain and earn yield on it. Maybe even lend it out to other people who might buy other cryptocurrencies with it.\n\nEven Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum has more TVL than Solana\n\nThere\u2019s about $53 billion in crypto locked up in DeFi protocols, and more than half of that is on Ethereum. Only 2.6% is staked with Solana platforms, equal to about $1.4 billion.\n\nTVL gets a bad rap by those who say it doesn\u2019t properly reflect how people interact with competing blockchains. Ignore them, they\u2019re probably Solana fans.\n\nUsers pay more to use Ethereum (a good thing)\n\nWe get it, there are cheaper blockchains to use than Ethereum. Solana is one of them.\n\nLow fees are great for anyone who wants to wash trade NFTs and memecoins, but they\u2019re not so great if you want people to actually make money by contributing to the network.\n\nEthereum users have paid more than $2.3 billion to use the blockchain this year. Over on Solana, users have forked out less than $20 million \u2014 under 1% of Ethereum fees.\n\nEven ignoring Ethereum, crypto users have paid way more to use Bitcoin and Tron than Solana\n\nGranted, Ethereum fees don\u2019t go directly to validators anymore, they\u2019re instead burned to reduce the supply, which, in a roundabout way, benefits all ETH holders.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, subsidizes the network\u2019s low fees by printing tokens, effectively penalizing all SOL holders with inflation.\n\nActive addresses and where to find them\n\nUntil we all scan our eyeballs with the Worldcoin orb and blend our biometrics with the blockchain, nailing down exactly how many people really use crypto is practically impossible.\n\nAll that shouldn\u2019t get in the way of pretending.\n\nAdding up the cumulative number of active addresses every day this year across 29 different blockchains shows Ethereum, Solana and even Bitcoin aren\u2019t even the most popular chains.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling how many of these are unique individuals. Whatever, big numbers are good numbers\n\nThe cumulative daily active addresses for Justin Sun\u2019s Tron is almost 600 million. Binance\u2019s BNB Chain has attracted more than three times the active addresses of Solana.\n\nEthereum mainnet\u2019s count is only slightly ahead of Solana\u2019s, but including layer-2s like zkSync Era, Arbitrum and Optimism gives more than 300 million.\n\nEthereum against the world (wide web 2.0)\n\nCrypto market caps are terribly inaccurate. They\u2019re easily gamed, never take lost supplies into account and hardly ever reflect the real liquidity of the underlying token.\n\nThis often results in valuations far higher than what could be realistically extracted from the market itself. Sounds bad, but most of that can be also said of market capitalizations for stocks.\n\nIn any case, if Ethereum was a stock, with which industries would it compete?\n\nSure, comparing crypto to stocks is apples to oranges. It still feels right\n\nEthereum\u2019s whole \u201cworld computer\u201d shtick could force it alongside cloud stocks like Amazon, Cisco and IBM. The network\u2019s power to process stablecoin payments would otherwise put it against PayPal, Visa and Mastercard.\n\nWell, Ethereum\u2019s market cap, averaged out over the past six months, is three times PayPal\u2019s and seven times more than the stock valuation of Cash App creator Block (formerly Square).\n\nSolana\u2019s current market cap is now above Block\u2019s, but its average since June is lower than all of them.\n\nDavid is an Editor based in the Netherlands focused on data-driven journalism.

        "content": "Mustafa has been writing about Blockchain and crypto since many years. He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nCryptocurrencies have been the topic of discussion since their inception, and many known personalities believe in investing in them. They also give investors their outlook and share predictions about them.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Ethereum, which is used worldwide due to its secure network, validated transitions, and sustainable ecosystem. According to YChart, as of September 2023, there are over 245 million distinct Ethereum wallets in use globally.\n\nScott Melker\u2019s Predictions for Ethereum\n\nScott Melker, a prominent cryptocurrency trader, author, and podcaster, has made a bold prediction for the future price of Ethereum. Melker forecasts that the value of Ethereum will reach $12, 000 in 2024. He believes that the growing interest among investors in decentralized finance and the increasing demand for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain will drive up the price.\n\nMoreover, Melker anticipates that the upcoming merger between the Ethereum mainnet and Beacon Chain will significantly enhance the network\u2019s scalability and security, making it more appealing to investors.\n\nMy target for 2025 is $12,000.\n\n\n\nBut not for $BTC.\n\n\n\nFor $ETH. \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) December 31, 2023\n\nLark Darvis Predictions for Cryptocurrencies\n\nLark Davis, a well-known crypto YouTuber, has also given his thoughts regarding the future of cryptocurrencies. Davis speculates that the cryptocurrency markets will surge in 2024. Davis\u2019s predictions are grounded in several factors.\n\nFirstly, he expects that the current parabolic growth of stock markets will result in more people having spare cash to invest in exchanges.\n\nSecondly, he anticipates that Bitcoin ETFs may be approved by the SEC in Q1 of this year, which could significantly boost the value of Bitcoin and other exchanges.\n\nThird, Davis points out that major corporations are increasingly adopting blockchain technology, which could drive up the interest and need for cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum started 2023 with a slow start and a value of $1196, and itself did even better than most, almost doubling its price since the outset of the year! It went from $1200 to a happy $2260, a whopping 99% increase.\n\nIn 2024 it is expected that Ethereum will surge to mark $3000 and this may be due to global macroeconomic conditions, increased security, and many other aspects."

This element was highlighted in 2022 when it led to the integration of the Ethereum mainnet and the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake blockchain.\n\nFollowing this integration, Ethereum transitioned from a power-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to PoS, significantly reducing the network\u2019s overall energy consumption.\n\nThe roadmap also highlighted Ethereum\u2019s focus on single-slot finality (SSF), a concept designed to ensure that changes to blocks on a blockchain cannot be reversed without burning at least 33% of the total staked ETH.\n\nButerin also detailed how the Scourge priority would become more focused on combating economic centralization in Ethereum, particularly regarding MEV and liquid stake pooling.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin pitches 3 pathways to simplify Ethereum\u2019s PoS model\n\nButerin to make ETH cypherpunk again\n\nRecently, as reported by crypto.news, Buterin shared plans to reincorporate the original principles of the \u201ccypherpunk\u201d revolution into blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum CEO originally envisioned the network as a universally accessible, decentralized hard drive utilizing peer-to-peer communication and file storage. However, starting in 2017, Ethereum\u2019s focus began to shift toward financial applications, according to Buterin.\n\nIn the future, he hopes to revive the quintessential \u201ccypherpunk\u201d ideals, such as decentralization, open participation, resistance to censorship, and trustworthiness.\n\nButerin also noted that recent advancements like rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and second-generation privacy solutions align well with Ethereum\u2019s original values.\n\nDespite minor setbacks and challenges, his updated 2024 vision for Ethereum points towards an optimistic future, with analysts like Raoul Pal forecasting a potential price rise for ETH of up to $5,300.\n\nETH price to blow in 2024?\n\nFrom Pal\u2019s perspective, Ethereum\u2019s price is poised for a significant uptrend. It isn\u2019t a random prediction\u2014Pal has grounded it in the liquidity indicator, a key tool that analysts leverage to forecast the potential price shifts of assets.\n\nWhile the Real Vision co-founder injected a note of caution, reminding crypto investors that his forecasts aren\u2019t guaranteed, he exhibited an undeniable bullish outlook for Ethereum.\n\nPal further pointed out the potential impact of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Ethereum\u2019s progress. He postulated that the introduction of a Bitcoin spot ETF could set the stage for an Ethereum ETF, revitalizing the Ethereum ecosystem in the process.\n\nPal\u2019s outlook was shared by analysts at CryptosRUs, who predicted a surge in ETH\u2019s growth starting in Q1 2024.\n\nOver the past few weeks, we have seen rotations of capital through several crypto ecosystems, including #CosmosEcosystem , #Solana, #Injective, #BRC20s, and #Avalanche.\n\n\n\nIn today's #analysis, I am going to explain why I believe Ethereum will be the next ecosystem to see explosive\u2026 pic.twitter.com/XdFxqzkbUP \u2014 CryptosRUs Analysis (@CRUAnalysis) December 26, 2023\n\nAccording to the analysts, ETH\u2019s upward trajectory will be fueled by factors such as positive market sentiment, the seasonality of ETH and Bitcoin (BTC), and the forthcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nIn November, IntoTheBlock reported that over 75% of Ethereum addresses were profitable at a time when ETH was priced at $2,200. The market intelligence platform also stated that only about 22.5% of Ethereum addresses experienced unrealized losses, with close to 1.17% at the break-even point.\n\nEthereum\u2019s network activity also saw significant rises, with the number of new addresses on the network spiking by about 17.5% and active addresses seeing a boost of roughly 23%.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum addresses without ETH balances also surged by around 74%, while the number of Ethereum addresses with ETH balances is on a steadily ascending trajectory.\n\nOver the past 30 days, the average count of Ethereum addresses was approximately 102.72 million\u2014more than double the number for Bitcoin.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has revealed an ambitious roadmap for the development of the Ethereum blockchain in 2024.\n\nIn a series of posts on X Saturday, Buterin detailed the strategic goals that will shape Ethereum\u2019s development landscape in the coming months. Notably, the roadmap, which resembles the previous year\u2019s plan, reflects Ethereum\u2019s commitment to consistent development.\n\nButerin highlighted six core components guiding Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in 2024, namely the merge, the surge, the scourge, the verge, the purge, and the splurge. These components were accompanied by detailed explanations and graphics, offering the community a transparent insight into Ethereum\u2019s strategic priorities.\n\nAt the heart of this roadmap lies \u201cthe Merge,\u201d a pivotal element executed in September 2022. Notably, the successful execution of the Merge marked a momentous shift from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus to the more sustainable PoS consensus mechanism, significantly reducing Ethereum\u2019s overall energy consumption.\n\nButerin disclosed plans to advance Ethereum\u2019s Single Slot Finality (SSF) in 2024. This feature is designed to ensure irreversible changes to blockchain blocks, requiring burning at least 33% of the total staked ETH for any attempts at reversal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSingle slot finality (SSF) is emerging as a clear solution to address several of the current shortcomings in Ethereum\u2019s PoS design,\u201d said Buterin.\n\nUnder \u201cThe Surge,\u201d Buterin set an ambitious goal of achieving 100,000 transactions per second on the Ethereum network through the implementation of rollups. This enhancement is poised to significantly boost the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain, addressing a long-standing challenge faced by the platform.\n\nFurther, in tackling centralization risks within Ethereum\u2019s PoS design, Buterin introduced \u201cThe Scourge,\u201d focusing on mitigating concerns related to Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and liquid staking. This aligns with Buterin\u2019s commitment to maintaining a decentralized and secure network, emphasizing the importance of a robust and trustworthy blockchain ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThe Verge\u201d is another crucial element in the roadmap, with Buterin aiming to simplify block verification processes. This streamlining is expected to enhance efficiency and reduce potential bottlenecks within the system, further contributing to Ethereum\u2019s overall performance.\n\nButerin\u2019s commentary aligned with a Friday tweet that suggested his intent to revive blockchain technology\u2019s original \u201ccypherpunk\u201d ethos. The term \u201ccypherpunk\u201d refers to individuals advocating for privacy using cryptography, especially against government surveillance.\n\nIn a reflective blog post, Buterin discussed Ethereum\u2019s initial conception as a \u201cpublic decentralized shared hard drive.\u201d He highlighted the platform\u2019s roots in peer-to-peer communication and decentralized file storage. However, Buterin acknowledged a shift in Ethereum\u2019s direction in 2017, with a growing focus on financial applications.\n\nThat said, as Ethereum steers towards a future defined by sustainable consensus mechanisms and a renewed commitment to privacy, the community eagerly awaits the unfolding of these strategic goals throughout 2024."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nWith Ethereum transaction activities increasingly shifting to Layer 2 (L2) networks, the ecosystem is bracing for a potential new bull run, one that could be predominantly led by these L2 platforms like Arbitrum and Optimism. The surge in L2 transactions, which have grown by an astounding 90 times since 2021, paints a clear picture: The next wave of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and meme coins is likely to be rooted in these scalable networks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe main network layer of Ethereum has faced significant challenges in scaling to meet the demands of its growing user base and application field. High gas fees and network congestion have highlighted the limitations of the current infrastructure, making the need for efficient L2 solutions more pressing than ever. These L2 networks are designed to offload the burden from the Ethereum mainnet, offering faster transactions and lower fees, making them an attractive alternative for developers.\n\nETH/USD chart by TradingView\n\nThis shift toward L2 networks does not just represent a stop-gap solution but is becoming integral to Ethereum's future. It is reasonable to expect that the initial signs of a rally within the Ethereum ecosystem will emerge on these scalable platforms. They are set to be the breeding ground for innovation and the go-to space for new projects in DeFi, NFTs and beyond.\n\nThe new Ethereum road map, as outlined by Vitalik Buterin, underscores this transition. Key updates to the road map include the solidification of single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge proof of stake (PoS) improvements, which aims to enhance the efficiency and security of the network. Buterin has also highlighted the importance of cross-rollup standards and interoperability as areas requiring long-term development. These would enable seamless communication and transaction execution across different L2 solutions, furthering the composability of the ecosystem.\n\nFurther developments such as the redesign of The Scourge, the nearing readiness of Verkle trees for inclusion, and the shrinking of \"state expiry\" to reflect a broader consensus show a commitment to continuous improvement. Additions like deep cryptography, including obfuscation and delay-encrypted mempools, suggest a forward-looking approach to security and privacy within the network."

This year, the percent of long-term $ETH holders surpassed that of Bitcoin for the second time ever! pic.twitter.com/i6kDzAjzgM \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 30, 2023\n\nEthereum's ability to surpass Bitcoin in the percentage of long-term holders can be attributed to several factors. The continuous development of the Ethereum network, including the new road map and the growing ecosystem on Layer 2 networks, boosted investor confidence. Furthermore, the majority of investors believe that Ethereum is still lagging behind and has not yet shown its true market potential.\n\nHowever, a high percentage of long-term holders can present a double-edged sword for a network's performance. While it indicates trust and a long-term vision, it can also lead to reduced liquidity and potentially hinder short-term price performance. In the accumulation phase, this is typically seen as positive; it suggests that investors are accumulating and holding, which could drive up prices in the future due to reduced supply.\n\nDespite this positive sentiment among holders, Ethereum's price performance is still trailing behind some of its peers. This may be due to a variety of factors, including market cycles and the broader economic environment affecting risk assets.\n\nYet, the traction on Ethereum's Layer 2 networks provides a silver lining. The increase in activity and the scaling solutions offered by these networks are enhancing Ethereum's usability and could serve as catalysts for future growth. The rise of Layer 2 solutions is key to Ethereum's ability to handle increased transaction throughput, reduce fees and improve the overall user experience."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s updated roadmap focuses on compatibility and redesigning key elements.\n\nCriticisms arise over Ethereum\u2019s emphasis on Layer 2 scaling.\n\nDespite the uncertainty in the crypto markets, Ethereum[ETH] has consistently been dedicated to making developments on its network. These developments usually follow along a roadmap that has been laid out by Vitalik Buterin and his team.\n\nThis roadmap serves as a guiding framework for the continuous development of the Ethereum network.\n\nNew directions for Ethereum\n\nThe latest amendments to Ethereum\u2019s roadmap bring attention to crucial enhancements. The role of single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge Proof-of-Stake (PoS) improvement takes center stage, offering a glimpse into the network\u2019s future direction.\n\nFor context, Single Slot Finality (SSF) means quickly and securely confirming transactions in just one time slot on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nLooking at the finer details\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum is placing importance on long-term enhancements by working on making different parts of its technology compatible and interconnected.\n\nThese updates signal Ethereum\u2019s commitment to refining its infrastructure and improving scalability. The roadmap aims to address technical intricacies, making Ethereum more robust and interoperable.\n\nWhile these changes bring promises of a more sophisticated network, the question arises of whether these updates impact Ethereum in the long run.\n\nThe commitment to single-slot finality and advancements in tree structures could potentially enhance transaction speed. It would also impact the efficiency of the network.\n\nSome critiques\n\nHowever, not all sentiments were unanimously positive. Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, voiced a critique that resonates with concerns about Ethereum\u2019s focus on Layer 2 (L2) scaling.\n\nAccording to Bons, the roadmap lacks a clear emphasis on Layer 1 (L1) scaling, arguing that Ethereum is pushing users toward custodian L2s, which may introduce censorship vulnerabilities.\n\nThis critique underscores a philosophical divergence in approach, with Bons advocating for a unified shelling point through L1 scaling.\n\n1/8) The roadmap released by @VitalikButerin today proves that ETH will never scale There is, in fact, zero L1 scaling on the roadmap Everything is focused on L2s instead of empowering people to use the blockchain directly That is not cypherpunk at allhttps://t.co/6WFqNd0sQf \u2014 Justin Bons (@Justin_Bons) December 31, 2023\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAs the community grapples with differing perspectives, the price of ETH adds another layer to the narrative. At the time of writing, ETH is priced at $2,361.39, experiencing a modest decline of -1.21% in the last 24 hours.\n\nConcurrently, the trading volume around ETH also saw a decrease."

        "content": "Mon 01 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the renowned co-founder of Ethereum, has recently revealed the roadmap and vision for the network in 2024. In a series of posts, he detailed the 6 main components that will shape Ethereum this year. Here\u2019s an overview of the strategic directions for the network\u2019s development in 2024.\n\nSingle-slot finality at the heart of technical improvements\n\nOne of the key points of the roadmap is the development of single-slot finality (SSF). This mechanism aims to reinforce the irreversibility of blocks on Ethereum. The SSF allows for locking in changes in a block, except in the case of a major attack.\n\nFor Buterin, the SSF seems to be the ideal solution to address the current weaknesses of proof of stake. By consolidating irreversibility, it would greatly improve the resilience and security of the consensus. Therefore, the SSF appears as the cornerstone of the upcoming technical efforts.\n\nBack to the cypherpunk roots of the initial vision\n\nButerin also recalled his original vision for Ethereum, rooted in the cypherpunk legacy. He wanted it to be a kind of \u201cdecentralized hard drive\u201d using cryptography. But this aspect has faded since 2017 with the rise of financial features.\n\nAccording to Vitalik Buterin, recent innovations like rollups or ZK-Snarks could help reconnect with the cypherpunk values. Thus, returning Ethereum\u2019s technological and liberating dimension is part of the goals for 2024.\n\nOther pillars of Ethereum\u2019s development in 2024\n\nAside from single-slot finality and a return to a more cypherpunk vision, Buterin has outlined several other key directions for the ongoing development of Ethereum in 2024 in his roadmap:\n\nImproving scalability through rollups and sharding\n\nStrengthening the decentralization of validation nodes\n\nOptimizing user experience to attract more developers\n\nContinuing with security updates and protocol upgrades\n\nIncorporating innovations from recent academic research\n\nThe ultimate goal is to make Ethereum a reference blockchain, combining security, decentralization, high processing capacity, privacy, and innovation capacity. An extremely ambitious program that will require cutting-edge technical advancements in the years to come.\n\nThrough this roadmap, Vitalik Buterin sketches the contours of a more technically proficient Ethereum that remains true to its cypherpunk roots. Realizing this ambitious vision will involve innovations like single-slot finality. The plan for 2024 offers a fascinating glimpse into the developments to come for Ethereum.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "The last twelve months have been nothing short of a wild ride for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins, from BTC price revival \u2014 the cryptocurrency jumped by more than 160% in 2023 \u2014 to innovations in the Web3 industry and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), to the government crackdowns on the industry.\n\nEven amid all this hullabaloo, crypto continues to be an enticing money-making gig. Take the record 19 billionaires \u2014 7 more than last year \u2014 who made a fortune after investing in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhat links Elon Musk, the Winklevoss Twins \u2014 owner of crypto exchange Gemini \u2014 and Michael Saylor? They\u2019re all connected to some cryptocurrency. While Musk and Tesla are, more often than not, tied to Dogecoin and Bitcoin, respectively, the other two names have significant Bitcoin holdings.\n\nLargest ETH Holder Owns 29% of All Ethereum Tokens In Circulation\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum, it\u2019s a different story altogether. Even the largest holders of ETH are often out of the limelight. However, data from Etherscan revealed that crypto exchanges were the largest holders of ETH in 2023, which shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, given ETH\u2019s availability on every exchange.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the numbers. Remember, these are only ballpark estimates.\n\n\n\nThe Beacon Chain Contract holds more than 35 million ETH, controlling over 29% of all ETH tokens in circulation, making it the largest ETH holder as of Dec 28, 2023. Coming in second place is Wrapped ETH (WETH) with more than 3.2 million ETH, worth around $7.7 billion.\n\nBinance has significant ETH Holdings\n\nIt\u2019s only fitting that the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, is the third-largest single address for ETH, holding more than nearly 2 million ETH. Kraken, which was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month for deceptive practices, grabbed the fourth spot, with ETH holdings of roughly 1.6 million.\n\nPopular trading platform, Robinhood is fifth on the list. At the time of writing, it had more than 1.4 million ETH under its belly, which loosely translates to about 1.24% of all ETH tokens in circulation.\n\nNotably, two other wallet addresses in the top 10 \u2014 each holding more than 550,000 ETH \u2014 are linked to crypto exchange giant Binance. Rounding off the top 10 are Arbitrum: Bridge, with holdings of over 1.3 million, and Bitfinex, with more than 450,000 ETH.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that an ETH address linked to Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of Ethereum, named VB 3, holds more than 240,000 ETH."

        "content": "ETH may fall to $2,215 as large sell-off spreads.\n\nTraders are confident that the altcoin will recover in no time.\n\nAccording to Whale Alert, a whale sent 14,610 Ethereum [ETH] tokens to the Coinbase exchange on the 30th of December. The transaction was the second one within 12 hours after an initial transfer involving 9,991 ETH.\n\nAs of this writing, the value of the transaction was worth $33.50 million. The move is a sign that the altcoin might be at risk of selling pressure.\n\nIf the cryptocurrency keeps experiencing a high inflow into exchanges, then the price could drop from $2,220.\n\nInterestingly, the last week of 2023 has given the ETH a turnaround. On the 28th of December, the value of ETH hit $2,415 as AMBCrypto reported.\n\nThis increase gave the Ethereum community a glimmer of hope that the ETH price season to shine was close.\n\nNo backing down on the potential\n\nHowever, the past few days indicated that ETH holders might need to wait a little longer for an extended rally. But what do traders think of the price action?\n\nAMBCrypto analyzed ETH\u2019s funding rate via the crypto analysis tool Santiment.\n\nFunding rates show if long are paying a funding fee to shorts. It also indicates if it\u2019s the other way around. If the Funding Rate is positive, then most traders are bullish. Also, a negative Funding Rate suggests more short positions than longs.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s Funding Rate was 0.031%. This reading suggested that traders were bullish on the price at press time.\n\nAnother metric to consider in assessing market perception toward ETH is the Weighted Sentiment. From the chart above, the Weighted Sentiment had dropped from 2.47 to 0.48.\n\nThe decline suggested the broader market was being careful in betting on the Ethereum native cryptocurrency.\n\nETH eyes another downturn\n\nRegarding the Open Interest, Coinglass showed that the indicator had risen to $8.40 billion. Open Interest measures market sentiment and strength behind price trends.\n\nSo, the increase means that money was flowing into contracts related to ETH. However, it could also be a sign of strength for the downward trend ETH\u2019s price was going through.\n\nFrom the ETH/USD 4-hour chart, the altcoin had felt the impact of the sell-offs as the price decreased to $2,290. A look at the Awesome Oscillator (AO) also showed that the momentum around the coin was bearish.\n\nAt the time of writing, the AO was -10.45.\n\nShould the indicator remain that way, then ETH\u2019s price might plunge further. Another indicator to consider was the Fibonacci Retracement. At press time, the 0.786 Fib Retracement level was at $2,215.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThis position indicated that ETH might drop to the region as long as selling pressure remained.\n\nHowever, $2,215 could be a good entry. This is because ETH has the potential to rebound, since the price was a previous support level for the altcoin."

        "content": "Investors at large were accumulating ETH while its price remained low.\n\nThough confidence was high, market indicators remained bearish on ETH.\n\nAs we bid adieu to 2023, Ethereum [ETH], the king of altcoins, made remarkable moves in a bid to outshine the king of cryptos, Bitcoin [BTC].\n\nA recent development signified increased confidence among investors in ETH at a time when Bitcoin awaits a major event. Does this mean that Ethereum will earn investors profits in 2024?\n\nLong-term holders are confident in Ethereum\n\nAs per the latest tweet from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum recently flipped Bitcoin in a key metric. To be precise, Ethereum\u2019s total number of long-term holders [LTHs] surpassed that of Bitcoin for the second time ever.\n\nThis reflected investors\u2019 faith in ETH, showing that they expected the altcoin to surge in the coming year.\n\n2023 Review! This year, the percent of long-term $ETH holders surpassed that of Bitcoin for the second time ever! pic.twitter.com/i6kDzAjzgM \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 30, 2023\n\nIt was interesting to note that while ETH overtook Bitcoin in terms of LTHs, the average holding time of Bitcoin was around four years, while Cardano\u2019s [ADA] was less than a year, as reported earlier by AMBCrypto.\n\nTo see whether long-term holders\u2019 mindsets affected retail investors\u2019 behavior, AMBCrypto checked Santiment\u2019s data.\n\nOur analysis found that the market at large was showing faith in ETH as it continued to stockpile. ETH\u2019s Supply on Exchanges witnessed a drop in the recent past, while its Supply outside of Exchanges rose consistently.\n\nThe fact that investors were buying ETH was further proven by AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data, as ETH\u2019s exchange reserve was decreasing at press time.\n\nWhale activity around Ethereum also remained high throughout the last month, as evident from the rise in its whale transaction count. In fact, whales were shown to be buying Ethereum, as the altcoin\u2019s supply held by top addresses shot up.\n\nThings on the derivatives side also looked optimistic, as its Taker Buy Sell Ratio was green. This meant that buying sentiment was dominant in the Futures market.\n\nThe coin\u2019s Funding Rate also remained high, meaning that the derivatives investors were actively buying ETH at press time.\n\n2024 to be bullish for Ethereum?\n\nHowever, despite investors\u2019 attempts to stockpile ETH, the token\u2019s price action turned bearish during the concluding days of 2023. According to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by nearly 1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,283.21 with a market capitalization of over $274 billion.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nTo see whether Ethereum would begin 2024 with a bull rally, AMBCrypto took a look at its daily chart. Our analysis found that investor confidence in ETH might take time to reflect on its price, as the MACD displayed a bearish crossover at press time.\n\nIts Relative Strength Index (RSI) also moved downward, suggesting a slight price drop in the near term."

        "content": "Ethereum is still the leading Dapp chain. It comes with a first mover advantage. Furthermore, it offers security, due to its size, to all projects and L2s. It also offers a thriving consumer crypto ecosystem.\n\nIn this article, we dig into 10 apps to watch out for in 2024. So, let\u2019s take a closer look at what 10 interesting apps Ethereum has to offer in 2024. This is the first part.\n\n1) Interface\n\nInterface is a mobile explorer. It allows you to follow wallets. This, in turn, allows you to see their activity. The app has a few tricks up its sleeve. For example, you can view other accounts based on common assets. Or how about finding other users you follow on other platforms?\n\nHowever, one of its top features is the push notification option. It allows you to see what your friends are up to in real time. What are they minting or trading. Never miss out on trendy events, like hot meme coins.\n\nTo date, they have raised $1.4 million. That\u2019s after an initial crowdfunding campaign. This campaign netted the platform 50 ETH back in early 2022. Before you can enter the app, you need to meet some criteria. These show that you have some Web3 experience.\n\nFollow creators on Interface -> get notified when a new article is published -> be first to mint -> earn Mirror Protocol rewards. https://t.co/Eb2cG7Ym4I \u2014 Interface (@interfacedapp) December 19, 2023\n\n2) Zora\n\nZora is an NFT marketplace. The platform dates to 2020 when it was founded. It\u2019s also a Layer 2 on Ethereum. Zora has plenty of cool features. For instance, there\u2019s a no-code creator tool kit. You can create collections with ease and put them up for minting.\n\nAnd guess what, the Zora chain doesn\u2019t have a token yet. So, being active on Zora, and mint regularly, may help you to qualify for their airdrop. You can mint on Zora or other NFT marketplaces, that you can find on the Zora chain. For example, mint dot fun.\n\nThey also have a cool referral program. If you bring in creators, you get 0.000111 ETH per mint. That can quickly add up to an interesting amount of ETH.\n\nWe made it rewarding:\n\n\u2737 No create fees\n\n\u2737 Protocol Rewards\n\n\u2737 Mint + create referrals\n\n\u2737 First minter rewards\n\n\u2737 Splits + so much more \u2014 Zora (@ourZORA) December 31, 2023\n\n3) Brian\n\nWith Brian, we move into the AI space. That\u2019s one of the narratives that has a lot of growth potential in 2024. Brian has a specific feature that makes it stand out. It gives prompts in English. It offers three different bots that you can deploy. There\u2019s a Telegram, X, and website bot available.\n\nThe app is also noncustodial. This is of importance because you stay in control of your assets. The project already has a token, BRAIN. Their website is brainai.tech. Brain advertises itself as the first blockchain AI SaaS offering. Besides the contextual chat, staking and NFT minting are in the pipeline. Currently, Brian is only available as a mobile version.\n\nSo, next time, you can tell the app, \u201cHi Brian, please swap 150 OP to BRAIN on Uniswap\u201d. How cool is that?\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Five FAQs for all the new @BrianknowsAI users! 1. What is Brian? Brian is an AI assistant that allows users to perform transactions, research web3 info and data, and deploy smart contracts by prompting. These operations are already available in the Brian App, which is in\u2026 pic.twitter.com/4znzAz0zM3 \u2014 Brian (@BrianknowsAI) December 29, 2023\n\n4) Warpcast\n\nWarpcast is like Twitter. It\u2019s a social media app on the Farcaster protocol. It offers a lot of Web3 features. However, you can also port your following into various other apps. Now that is a real special feature. Wherever you go on Ethereum, you will see familiar faces this way. It\u2019s like making Ethereum your hood!\n\nAs a result, their X profile is not very active. Their last X post dates to 16th August 2023. Instead, you can create an account and join their conversation in real time. It\u2019s a decentralized app that wants to give data ownership back to its users. That\u2019s you.\n\nThe team behind Warpcast is former Coinbase staff. So, it seems like a solid team with a Web3, and crypto background is at the helm. The picture below shows the X based messages.\n\nSource: Warpcast\n\n5) Privy\n\nPrivy is an embedded wallet for Web3 logins. You can onboard users to a Web3 app, regardless if they already have a wallet or not. You most likely have used it, without knowing or realizing it. Not only that, but you can sign in with an email or password. At the same time, a wallet already works in the background. A convenient option for Web2 users to get into Web3.\n\nIn November, the team had a series A funding round that netted $18 million. So, they seem financially sound. They\u2019re backed by some heavy weights. For example, Sequoia, Paradigm, or Electric Capital. Furthermore, the team offers secure solutions for their app. You can also customize the app, which helps with integration in your very own app.\n\n1/ Transaction MFA \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Wallets are not one-size-fits-all. As assets grow in a user\u2019s account, it becomes important to layer on additional security measures. Privy now offers the ability for users to require successful MFA verification prior to embedded wallet transactions. pic.twitter.com/JKFPq1q1bV \u2014 Privy (@privy_io) December 20, 2023\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

        "content": "Running and Managing Your Ethereum Mining Rig\n\nEffectively running and managing an Ethereum mining rig is crucial for maximizing profitability and ensuring the longevity of your mining operation. This section of the guide will provide essential tips on starting the mining process, monitoring performance, maintaining your setup, troubleshooting common issues, and optimizing mining efficiency.\n\nStarting the Mining Process\n\nInitial Setup: After assembling and configuring your hardware and software, ensure all connections are secure and the mining software is properly set up with your wallet address and mining pool details.\n\nPowering On: Switch on your mining rig. The initial boot-up might take some time as the system checks all components.\n\nLaunching Mining Software: Once the system is up, launch your chosen mining software. It should automatically connect to the mining pool (if you\u2019re pool mining) and start the mining process.\n\nMonitoring Initial Performance: Monitor the initial performance for a few hours to ensure everything is running smoothly. Pay attention to hash rates, temperature readings, and any error messages.\n\nMonitoring and Maintenance\n\nContinual monitoring of your mining rig is not just about checking its performance but also about preempting potential issues. Regularly tracking metrics such as hash rate and system temperature helps in maintaining the health of your mining rig. Efficient temperature management is paramount. High temperatures can be detrimental to your hardware, so it\u2019s essential to have effective cooling solutions in place and ensure your mining environment is well-ventilated.\n\nKeeping your software updated is another critical aspect of maintenance. Regular updates to your mining software and GPU drivers can lead to improvements in efficiency, security enhancements, and sometimes, increased mining capabilities.\n\nTroubleshooting Common Issues\n\nNo mining operation is immune to issues, but timely troubleshooting can save you from prolonged downtimes and potential losses. Overheating is a common problem, often addressed by enhancing cooling solutions or cleaning existing fans and heat sinks.

This move, part of Ethereum\u2019s ambitious 2.0 upgrade, signifies a fundamental shift in the network\u2019s mechanism for validating transactions and securing its Blockchain. In this in-depth analysis, we\u2019ll explore the nuances of this transition, its implications for miners, and the evolving landscape of Ethereum mining, ensuring alignment with Google\u2019s CRAFT and EEAT guidelines for comprehensive and authoritative content.\n\nThe Essence of Ethereum\u2019s Transition to Proof of Stake\n\nThe switch to Proof of Stake is a response to the increasing environmental concerns and scalability issues associated with Proof of Work. Unlike PoW, where miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks to the Blockchain, PoS involves validators who commit or \u2018stake\u2019 their Ethereum to participate in the process.\n\nEnergy Consumption: A key driver behind Ethereum\u2019s move to PoS is the significant reduction in energy consumption. PoS eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining operations, making the Ethereum network more sustainable and environmentally friendly.\n\nNetwork Security and Efficiency: PoS is designed to bolster the network\u2019s security and efficiency. Validators staking their Ethereum have a vested interest in maintaining the network\u2019s integrity, potentially reducing the likelihood of fraudulent transactions.\n\nImpact on the Mining Community\n\nThis paradigm shift brings about substantial changes for the Ethereum mining community, particularly those who have invested heavily in mining infrastructures.\n\nObsolescence of Mining Hardware: The transition effectively renders traditional Ethereum mining hardware, like GPUs and ASIC miners, obsolete for Ethereum. This development could lead to significant financial implications for miners, as the resale value and utility of their hardware diminish.\n\nReduced Role of Traditional Mining: As Ethereum fully transitions to PoS, the role of traditional mining, as we know it, will cease. This means that the extensive hardware setups currently used for Ethereum mining will no longer be required for network validation.\n\nEmergence of Staking Opportunities: For miners and investors looking to maintain their engagement with Ethereum, staking emerges as a viable alternative. It allows participants to become validators in the network, requiring a significantly lower power and hardware investment compared to traditional mining.\n\nFinancial Considerations for Existing Miners: The shift to PoS may necessitate a reevaluation of financial strategies for existing miners. The depreciation of dedicated mining hardware and the capital required for staking (32 ETH to become a full validator) are crucial factors to consider.\n\nStrategies for Transitioning\n\nAs the Ethereum ecosystem evolves, miners and investors must adapt to stay relevant and profitable.\n\nDiversifying Crypto Activities: Miners might need to diversify their operations, including mining other PoW cryptocurrencies or exploring other roles in the broader crypto ecosystem, like liquidity provision in DeFi platforms, running nodes for other Blockchains, or participating in staking pools.\n\nAdaptability is Key: The ability to adapt to the changing landscape will be critical. Keeping abreast of developments in Ethereum 2.0 and adjusting investment strategies accordingly will be essential for those looking to continue participating in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nExploring Staking Options: Interested parties should explore the ins and outs of Ethereum staking. This includes understanding the staking process, the risks involved, and the potential rewards. Joining staking pools could be an option for those unable to meet the full 32 ETH requirement for becoming a validator.\n\nResale and Repurposing of Hardware: For those with significant investments in mining hardware, exploring avenues for selling or repurposing their equipment is advisable. This might involve shifting to mine other PoW cryptocurrencies or selling the equipment to others in the mining community.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum mining is a critical process that ensures the Ethereum network functions correctly and securely. The role of miners cannot be overstated; they are indispensable in validating transactions, securing the network, creating new blocks, and maintaining the decentralization that makes Ethereum robust and trustworthy.\n\nFor prospective Ethereum miners, it\u2019s essential to understand the significance of their role. Mining requires a combination of technical knowledge, initial capital investment in hardware, and ongoing operational costs, primarily electricity. However, with the impending shift from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake in Ethereum 2.0, the traditional mining landscape is evolving. Future miners should stay informed about these changes and adapt their strategies accordingly.\n\nEthereum mining offers not just the potential for financial reward but also the opportunity to be part of a revolutionary technology that is reshaping how we think about digital transactions and decentralization. As with any investment, prospective miners should conduct thorough research, consider the risks, and proceed with a clear understanding of both the challenges and opportunities that lie in the world of Ethereum mining.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) may be experiencing a major drawdown at the moment, however, on-chain data points to a potential run in price in the short to mid-term.\n\nNext Ethereum (ETH) Price Target Locked\n\nAccording to on-chain market analyst, Ali Martinez, Ethereum currently has no significant barrier ahead of it judging by the In and Out of the Money Around Price indicator from crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis data shows that a total of 7.82 million addresses or 65.4% of the total wallets in the network are in the money, or profitable at the moment. This is compared with the 4.13 million addresses or 34.5% that are out of the money or in losses. Ethereum holders that are at break-even points or \u201cAt The Money\u201d are just approximately 12,430 or 0.10% of the total wallets in the network.\n\nTo Martinez, since there are no supply barriers in sight, Ethereum could ultimately soar as high as $2,700 in the short term, a level beyond the $2,500 conservative projection. Should this feat be achieved, Ethereum would be retesting a price level last seen in early May 2022.\n\nThis price call, though ambitious, is a big shift from current reality. At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading for $2,310.95, up by 0.28% in the past 24 hours as it tries to wriggle away from the mild losses accrued as the new year unfolds. Over the past week, Ethereum has still maintained a mildly bullish outlook, having surged by 1.12%.\n\nEthereum Versus Alternative Chains\n\nEthereum is facing an existential threat from some of the key rivals that surround it including Solana (SOL), XRP Ledger, Avalanche (AVAX), and Cardano (ADA) to mention a few.\n\nWhile the growth of Ethereum has been relatively poor compared to these alternatives, Solana has expanded its influence over the former with the visible flippening happening to DEX volumes and other core areas.\n\nIn addition, Solana has recorded a more bullish price action when compared to the past year as SOL jumped as high as 989% while Ethereum has only managed to print 94.16% over the past year. Other chains like Cardano and the XRPL are also innovating in a way that proves they are fully ready to evolve in the coming months."

        "content": "Ethereum has recently witnessed a notable development with the unveiling of its 2024 roadmap by co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Released in a series of informative posts on December 30, the roadmap has stirred the market, giving a promising trajectory for Ethereum\u2019s value. Ethereum (ETH)price stands at $2,281, with a slight 0.41% dip in the last 24 hours.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG advertisement \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nCentral to Ethereum\u2019s strategy is \u2018The Merge,\u2019 a landmark shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, first implemented in 2022. This transformative change marked Ethereum\u2019s shift from the energy-intensive proof-of-work model, showering a new era of efficiency and sustainability for the network. The Merge has been instrumental in Ethereum\u2019s progressive journey, significantly reducing its energy consumption and setting the stage for future innovations.\n\nInnovations and Market Response\n\nThe roadmap emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s commitment to enhancing blockchain stability and security. A key highlight is the focus on single-slot finality (SSF), a feature aimed at fortifying blockchain transactions. The roadmap addresses the Scourge priority, which focuses on mitigating economic centralization challenges, particularly in MEV (Miner Extractable Value) and liquid stake pooling.\n\nThese strategic developments have strengthened Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure and boosted market confidence. Consequently, there\u2019s growing anticipation of Ethereum reaching the $5,000 mark, driven by these roadmap revelations and positive market forecasts. Prominent crypto figure Raoul Pal and industry expert Arthur Hayes shared a recent video underscoring Ethereum\u2019s expanding influence and potential growth.\n\nTechnical Indicators and Market Trends\n\nEthereum\u2019s price analysis shows ETH has been fluctuating between $2,100 and $2,250 in recent months, exhibiting a bullish bias. The asset has surged over 90% in the past year, signaling the more buyers have been coming to the market.\n\nTechnical indicators reveal mixed signals as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart suggests a balancing act between bearish and bullish forces. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) hints at a potential trend reversal. The convergence of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages indicates a long-term bullish trend. The narrowing of Bollinger Bands points towards reduced volatility, possibly setting the stage for an upcoming price surge.\n\nEthereum Continues Trading Above $2,200 Amid Bearish Pressure\n\nIn the 4-hour chart, the Ethereum price has been trading around the $2,200 mark where buyers successfully defended against a further drop. This support zone triggered a rebound, with ETH climbing back to a supply zone at $2,304. Notably, this level has seen the formation of several double bottoms, a potential bullish reversal pattern.\n\nETH\u2019s recent trading session witnessed Ethereum bulls gaining enough strength to breach and the prices nearly broke the minor resistance at $2,400. Following this breakout, ETH ascended to an intraday high of $2,371, aligning closely with the 10-simple moving average, which currently sits at $2,317.\n\nThe broader market sentiment, as indicated by 25 major indicators, leans heavily towards a bullish bias with 15 indicators signaling \u2018buy\u2019, 9 staying neutral, and only 2 suggesting \u2018sell\u2019. Oscillators present a more mixed view with 8 neutral, 2 sell, and 1 buy signals. The Moving Averages echo the bullish sentiment strongly, with 14 buys, 1 neutral, and no sells. However, the MACD remains negative at 35.3 on the 4-hour chart, indicating a sell signal, while the RSI at 54.9 is in the neutral zone.\n\nLooking ahead, the bulls are targeting the $2,400 level, following a decisive move above the 10-day EMA 10 ($2,291.9). Should the bears take full control at current levels, ETH might retreat to its main support at EMA 100 ($2,038.39). A failure to hold this support could see Ethereum descend towards EMA 50 and SMA 50, around $2,170. Such a move would open the possibility of a downturn below the $2,000 threshold, a crucial psychological level for the market.\n\nAlso read:"

Among these, hard forks stand out as the most significant, resulting in an irreversible separation of the blockchain and the introduction of a new protocol that is entirely incompatible with the old one. Hard forks are frequently employed to create new cryptocurrencies and launch innovative blockchain projects.\n\nEthereum\u2019s prominence in the crypto space\n\nEthereum, with its substantial market capitalization, holds a prominent position in the world of blockchain. It has become the preferred choice for various purposes, including token issuance, decentralized platform creation, and the trading of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The Ethereum network witnesses daily transaction volumes worth billions of dollars, with an additional $28.4 billion locked within it through third-party products and services. Ethereum\u2019s success can be attributed in part to its active and engaged cryptocurrency community, which consistently implements systematic changes to enhance the network\u2019s capabilities.\n\nEthereum hard Forks and their significance\n\nEthereum, like many other blockchain networks, has experienced both soft and hard forks as part of its continuous development. To better understand Ethereum\u2019s hard forks, it\u2019s informative to reference notable hard forks in other blockchain networks, particularly Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin, the pioneering blockchain network created by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto, has also undergone several significant hard forks in its history. These include Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Segregated Witness (SegWit), Bitcoin Cash, among others. What these forks share in common with Ethereum\u2019s hard forks is their aim to implement protocol upgrades through network consensus.\n\nEthereum\u2019s hard forks have been prompted by a variety of concerns and challenges. These encompass issues related to security, decentralization, transaction fees, scalability, and limitations associated with ETH 1.0. Notably, Ethereum is more than just a digital currency; it serves as a versatile platform for a wide range of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Consequently, Ethereum\u2019s development roadmap has evolved to meet the diverse needs of its user base.\n\nEthereum\u2019s developmental roadmap\n\nEthereum\u2019s developmental roadmap consists of four main stages: Frontier, Homestead, Metropolis, and Serenity. Unlike many Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks primarily focused on cryptocurrency, Ethereum has had to adapt and expand its capabilities to accommodate a multitude of use cases and features. This roadmap serves as a guiding framework for Ethereum\u2019s ongoing development and improvement, with each stage addressing specific challenges and opportunities.\n\nFrontier Thawing\n\nThe Frontier Thawing hard fork, which came into effect on September 7, 2015, at block number 200,000, marked a crucial juncture in Ethereum\u2019s early development. Its significance lies in multiple facets. First, it introduced the concept of the \u201cdifficulty bomb,\u201d a mechanism designed to increase the mining process\u2019s complexity gradually. This served as a vital step in Ethereum\u2019s transition from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the more eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Furthermore, Frontier Thawing lifted the 5,000 gas limit per block, enhancing the network\u2019s capacity to handle transactions efficiently. This hard fork was not just about theoretical changes; it introduced concrete improvements, bolstering Ethereum\u2019s security and speed. In essence, it laid the foundation for Ethereum\u2019s future growth and development.\n\nHomestead\n\nHomestead, executed on March 14, 2016, stands as Ethereum\u2019s first meticulously planned hard fork. Its significance lies in its role as a milestone, marking Ethereum\u2019s departure from the beta phase and its entry into a more mature stage of development. This hard fork was driven by Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) such as EIP-2, EIP-7, and EIP-8. These EIPs ushered in protocol improvements aimed at refining smart contract creation and development protocol forward compatibility. Homestead, in essence, paved the way for Ethereum\u2019s growth by bolstering the network\u2019s robustness. Its strategic implementation and adherence to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal process demonstrated Ethereum\u2019s commitment to systematic upgrades and its continued journey towards mainstream adoption.\n\nThe DAO Fork\n\nThe DAO Fork, executed on July 20, 2016, marks one of the most pivotal moments in Ethereum\u2019s history. Its significance transcends technical updates, as it emerged in response to a critical vulnerability \u2013 the DAO attack, resulting in the loss of 3.6 million ETH. Ethereum\u2019s response was swift and impactful. The community voted to move the affected funds to a new contract, allowing original owners to withdraw their funds at a rate of 1 ETH for every 100 DAO tokens held. However, this solution led to a schism within the Ethereum community, giving rise to two separate blockchains \u2013 Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The DAO Fork, therefore, became a touchstone for Ethereum\u2019s governance and direction, reflecting the community\u2019s values and its commitment to security and integrity.\n\nByzantium\n\nThe Byzantium hard fork, integral to Ethereum\u2019s Metropolis upgrade, represents a critical juncture in the platform\u2019s development. This hard fork, executed on October 16, 2017, at block 4,370,000, brought forth significant enhancements. Key Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) introduced during Byzantium included EIP-100, which revamped the difficulty adjustment formula, resulting in a more consistent block time. EIP-197 and EIP-198 introduced ZK-Snarks, a form of zero-knowledge cryptography that bolstered privacy. EIP-649 delayed the difficulty bomb by one year and reduced mining rewards from 5 ETH to 3 ETH, mitigating inflation. Byzantium thus paved the way for future scaling solutions, curbed ETH inflation, and introduced functionalities that allowed the development of more complex smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network.\n\nConstantinople\n\nThe Constantinople hard fork, implemented on February 28, 2019, at block 7,280,000, marked a significant stride in Ethereum\u2019s journey towards Ethereum 2.0 while focusing on efficiency and economics.

EIP-1234 delayed the difficulty bomb for approximately 12 months and reduced block rewards from 3 ETH to 2 ETH. Constantinople\u2019s role was paramount in optimizing Ethereum\u2019s overall efficiency and economic sustainability, aligning it with Ethereum 2.0\u2019s long-term scaling strategy. This fork was a crucial step in Ethereum\u2019s evolution, preparing the network for the transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nIstanbul\n\nIstanbul, activated on December 8, 2019, at block 9,069,000, was designed to enhance Ethereum\u2019s compatibility with other protocols and improve its overall performance. It introduced several pivotal Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that significantly impacted the network. EIP-152 facilitated interoperability between Ethereum and the Zcash blockchain. EIP-1108 reduced gas costs for privacy and scaling solutions like SNARKs and STARKs, enhancing scalability and privacy. EIP-1884 increased gas costs for certain EVM operations, fortifying the network against spam attacks. EIP-2028 further reduced gas costs, aiding in Layer 2 scaling solutions like Plasma. Istanbul, in essence, elevated Ethereum\u2019s scalability, privacy, and resilience to denial-of-service attacks, streamlining the platform for developers and users alike.\n\nBeacon Chain\n\nThe Beacon Chain hard fork, launched on December 1, 2020, marked a crucial milestone in Ethereum\u2019s planned transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The Beacon Chain introduced PoS to Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, revolutionizing its security and decentralization mechanisms. In PoS, validators lock up ETH as collateral to validate transactions and secure the network. This shift enhances security by discouraging malicious actors, as they risk losing their staked ETH. Moreover, it promotes decentralization by allowing more participants to become validators, reducing the influence of centralized mining pools. The Beacon Chain continues to play a vital role in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, managing the PoS protocol while upholding the network\u2019s state and transaction processing in a separate execution layer.\n\nLondon Upgrade\n\nThe London upgrade, implemented in August 2021, introduced Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, fundamentally altering the network\u2019s transaction fee model. EIP-1559 introduced a new transaction fee structure that includes a base fee burned with each transaction, thereby reducing the supply of ETH over time. This innovation was a pivotal move toward economic sustainability for Ethereum. By curbing excessive gas fees and providing a predictable fee structure, EIP-1559 improved the user experience and made Ethereum more accessible for a broader range of participants. This upgrade was essential to ensure that Ethereum remains a viable platform for users and developers while addressing concerns about escalating transaction costs.\n\nThe Merge\n\nThe Merge, executed on September 15, 2022, stands as one of the most transformative moments in Ethereum\u2019s history. It signifies the complete transition from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) to the environmentally friendly Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This transition resulted in an astounding reduction of approximately 99.95% in energy consumption, effectively addressing one of the main criticisms of blockchain technology. Beyond its environmental benefits, The Merge has significant implications for scalability and security. The PoS mechanism enhances security by requiring validators to lock up ETH as collateral, and it lays the groundwork for Ethereum\u2019s future scalability solutions, ensuring its sustainability and continued growth.\n\nShanghai-Capella\n\nTechnically executed on the same day, April 12, 2023, at block 17,034,870, Shanghai and Capella are pivotal hard forks that have a shared goal: to facilitate staking withdrawals. Shanghai introduced the capability for staking withdrawals on the execution layer, while Capella upgraded the Beacon Chain, enabling blocks to accept withdrawal operations. These forks play a crucial role in enhancing the liquidity, security, and decentralization of staked assets. By making staking more accessible and flexible, they encourage more users to become validators, further strengthening the Ethereum network. These upgrades are a testament to Ethereum\u2019s commitment to optimizing its staking ecosystem and ensuring the security and liquidity of participants\u2019 assets.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey through its ten most significant hard forks has been transformative. Each fork, from Frontier Thawing\u2019s foundation-laying to The Merge\u2019s monumental shift to Proof-of-Stake, has propelled Ethereum\u2019s evolution.
