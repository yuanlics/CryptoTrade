        "content": "New data reveals that a deep-pocketed Ethereum (ETH) investor has woken up from a year of dormancy and is selling off its crypto assets as the top altcoin loses momentum.\n\nAccording to blockchain data tracker Lookonchain, the crypto whale has woken up from a 12-month slumber and is selling its stash of ETH over decentralized exchange platforms (DEX).\n\n\u201cA whale that has been dormant for one year is dumping ETH on DEX! So far, 18,865 ETH has been sold for four million DAI through four new wallets, the average selling price is $2,229. And currently has 5,588 ETH ($12.5 million) left.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,214 at time of writing, down about 6% from its 2023 high of $2,359.\n\nLookonchain then brings its attention toward the amount of decentralized oracle provider Chainlink (LINK) deposited into Binance, the top crypto exchange platform by volume. According to the data, noncirculating supply wallets deposited 8.3 million LINK, worth $119 million at time of writing, into Binance.\n\n\u201cThe wallets [have] deposited LINK to Binance every three months since Aug 26, 2022.\n\nInterestingly, most of the time, the deposit is at the bottom of the price and the price rises after that.\u201d\n\nChainlink is trading for $14.08 at time of writing.\n\nConcluding its analysis with Solana-based (SOL) memecoin Bonk (BONK), Lookonchain says that while one savvy trader lost $46,000 on November 1st, on December 15th, the same entity made a staggering $4.4 million from trading the dog-themed meme asset.\n\n\u201cThis trader owns two wallets. In the past year, the trader withdrew 334.5 billion BONK ($218,000) [from crypto exchange] MEXC and bought 32.18 billion BONK ($41,000) from DEX.\n\nAnd deposited 204.2 billion BONK ($80,000) to MEXC, leaving 172.5 billion BONK (worth $132,000 on Nov 1st). On Nov 1st, he still lost $46,000, but today he made $4.4 million.\u201d\n\nBONK is trading for $0.0000205 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

High Expectations and Upgrades: Experts predict ETH could reach up to $8,000 by 2026, bolstered by upcoming Ethereum upgrades, with short-term predictions around $3,400-$3,800.\n\nExperts predict ETH could reach up to $8,000 by 2026, bolstered by upcoming Ethereum upgrades, with short-term predictions around $3,400-$3,800. Some Bearish Perspectives: Despite optimism, some, like trader Peter Brandt, are skeptical about Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects, questioning its functionality and future as a listed asset.\n\nCan Ethereum Be the Best Performer Next Year?\n\nThroughout 2023, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum \u2013 Ether (ETH) \u2013 managed to recover most of the losses incurred during the devastating 2022, reaching almost $2,400 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data) a few days ago. However, that valuation is still at the foothills of the all-time high of over $4,800 registered in November 2021.\n\nSome analysts believe the recent uptrend could continue next year, with ETH rising to a new peak in the following months. According to FieryTrading, the asset has been in a bullish mode for the past year and a half, suggesting a further surge in the near future:\n\n\u201cAs seen on the chart, ETH has been trading inside a bullish triangle pattern for over 1.5 years. In my eyes, a break out from this pattern might result in big gains for ETH since it will burst through an area full of short-trade stop-losses, which will be forced to buy back their positions.\u201d\n\nThe analyst predicted that Ether could jump to the coveted level of $5,000 by the end of 2024 or the beginning of 2025.\n\nNikolaos Panigirtzoglou \u2013 Managing Director at JPMorgan \u2013 also gave his two cents, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s upcoming \u201cProtodanksharding\u201d (EIP-4844) upgrade. He claimed it could help the ecosystem thrive and push ETH\u2019s price toward $8,000 by 2026, while Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nThe popular X (Twitter) user Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe is another person who forecasted success for ETH next year. In his view, the asset might correct to approximately $1,900 but remains poised to soar to $3,400-$3,800 by the first quarter of 2024.\n\nOne Bearish Outlook\n\nIt is worth noting that some prominent figures are not so bullish on Ethereum. One example is the renowned trader Peter Brandt, who maintained that the token is \u201cnot comparable to BTC as a store of value.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke against the functionality of Ethereum and its gas prices, forecasting that it could \u201cnot even be a listed asset in 10 years.\u201d"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum market has recently witnessed a tempting approach toward the $2,500 mark. However, this price movement occurs amid a less-than-ideal backdrop for its decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which is currently struggling and showing no imminent signs of regaining its lost positions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe underperformance of Ethereum's DeFi sector can be attributed to several factors, one of which is the soaring transaction fees that have rendered the layer-1 platform challenging for average users.\n\nNetwork fees have escalated to levels that are widely considered unreasonable, severely impacting usability. In response to these persistent issues, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin has hinted at the integration of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) scaling solutions directly into the mainnet, an advancement eagerly anticipated by the community.\n\nAmid Ethereum's challenges, competitors like Solana are capturing attention, with its platform maintaining lower fees and higher transaction throughput. This competition has intensified the pressure on Ethereum to enhance its scalability and efficiency to maintain its leading position in the blockchain space.\n\nEthereum's price action offers a compelling narrative. The chart illustrates a notable uptrend, with the price having recently surged above multiple key moving averages, a bullish indicator for many traders. The convergence of the 50-day moving average above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages could suggest sustained bullish momentum. However, this positive trend is met with caution as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hints at a market that is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving room for volatility.\n\nThe chart also reveals that Ethereum has encountered resistance as it approaches the $2,500 level. This resistance zone is critical, and a convincing breakout above it could signal the start of a new rally. However, with the current strain on Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem and the competitive heat from blockchains like Solana, the potential for a breakthrough to $2,500 is enveloped in uncertainty.\n\nBONK's meteoric meme rise\n\nThe meteoric rise of Bonk (BONK) has sent ripples across the crypto industry, with its valuation reaching the billion-dollar mark and positioning it as a serious contender in the meme coin space. The recent listings on Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, have played a pivotal role in propelling BONK to new heights, reminding us of the astonishing ascent of Shiba Inu (SHIB) during the previous year's bull run.\n\nThe price chart for BONK displays a sharp upward trajectory, indicating a frenzied accumulation phase that often accompanies a new listing's excitement. Such price action is not uncommon for meme coins, which can capture the imagination of the trading community and lead to explosive short-term gains. The high social media buzz and community backing seem to reinforce the potential of BONK as the next viral sensation.\n\nHowever, seasoned market observers and analysts caution that the meme coin sector is notorious for its boom-and-bust cycles. As BONK's market cap has eclipsed that of other well-known meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and PEPE, comparisons to SHIB's rise are inevitable. Yet, there is an air of skepticism about whether BONK can maintain this blistering pace or if it will succumb to the same fate that befalls many high-flying tokens after the initial euphoria fades.\n\nIt is also important to stay extremely cautious when interacting with assets like Bonk: meme coins often experience significant corrections after such rapid expansions in price. The historical performance of similar assets suggests that BONK could face a challenging road ahead, especially if broader market sentiment shifts. While the dream of dethroning SHIB as a top meme coin is alive, the path is fraught with the potential for high volatility and sudden market turns."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is the largest and most used decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 layer-1 blockchain infrastructure. Its native token, ETH, is also the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with $270 billion at the time of publication.\n\nNotably, Ethereum\u2019s price is up 85% in the last year, now trading at $2,249 per token. This surge has rewarded ETH holders, who are now 76% in profit, according to data by IntoTheBlock on December 16.\n\nIn particular, the percentage of Ethereum investors in profit is the same as long-term holders, who have kept their positions for over a year. Both data sets are achieved by looking at all active addresses in the network from the received and spent transactions.\n\nHowever, 23% of all Ethereum wallets are holding a losing ETH position, while 1% acquired the token at current prices. At the same time, 21% of Ethereum holders have held their position for between one and 12 months, while 3% just recently bought ETH.\n\nEthereum (ETH) holders data. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nIs it time to buy ETH with 76% of Ethereum holders in profit?\n\nIt is important to understand that the higher the number of Ethereum holders in profit, the higher the likelihood of a sell-off, as they might want to realize the, so far, unrealized profit. Therefore, buying ETH right now could mean becoming the profitable exit liquidity for 76% of all Ethereum holders.\n\nMeanwhile, only 46% of the tokens are concentrated in the hands of addresses holding at least 0.1% of its supply. The low concentration of whales and institutional investors lowers the risk of huge coordinated sell-offs. Balancing the previous analysis.\n\nCryptocurrency traders controversially believe we are experiencing either a bull rally in a bear market or a bull market already. Understanding the current status of cryptocurrencies is essential to make a profitable decision of buying or not buying ETH.\n\nMoreover, further developments and DeFi ecosystem growth for Ethereum could generate more demand for its token. An increased demand would drive ETH prices up, while a reduced demand would create an opposite outcome.\n\nAll things considered, the decision to buy ETH is personal, and investors must be aware of the risks. Essentially, having a good risk management start is necessary while investing in such a volatile and experimental market.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Currently, all execution layer (EL) and consensus layer (CL) client combinations, including the Prysm client, have been onboarded to Devnet 12. MEV-Boost software has been activated for the majority of these client combinations, except for Prysm client combinations.\n\nThe much-awaited Ethereum Dencun upgrade will bring changes across Ethereum's two mainnet layers: the execution layer (EL) and the consensus layer (CL).\n\nThe upgrade to the execution layer is dubbed Cancun, while the consensus layer will receive the Deneb upgrade, forming the name Deneb-Cancun (or Dencun).\n\nThe exciting Dencun upgrade aims to tackle Ethereum's scalability challenges by implementing an improvement proposal named EIP-4844.\n\nAs earlier reported, developers might most likely begin upgrading public Ethereum testnets after the holidays in Q1, 2024.\n\nThe Goerli testnet, as it is presently known, will be sunsetting soon. Teams will begin exiting their validators either three months after the Dencun activation or one month after the Dencun mainnet activation, whichever comes later. Notably, the Dencun network upgrade will be the last one implemented on the network."
