        "title": "SEC Viewing Ethereum as a Commodity? Bloomberg Analyst Sees ETF Shift Happening - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nSEC chairman Gary Gensler has often argued that all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin are securities.\n\nHowever, as Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart recently pointed out, the agency has increasingly treated Ethereum as a commodity.\n\nBased on its acceptance of ETH futures, Seyffart anticipates the SEC approving spot Ethereum ETFs in 2024.\n\nUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler has often asserted that all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin are securities. But when the SEC accused Binance, Coinbase and Kraken of selling unregistered securities this year, one cryptocurrency \u2013 Ethereum \u2013 was conspicuously absent from the charges.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, \u201cthe SEC has pretty much implicitly accepted Ethereum as a commodity\u201d. From this, he concludes that if approved, spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) could be followed by ETH-based ones.\n\nETH Futures Suggests SEC Acceptance of Commodity Status\n\nWhen the CME Group applied for permission to launch the first Ethereum futures contracts in 2021, it claimed ETH was a commodity. Therefore, it was not subject to regulation by the SEC.\n\nThe SEC could have object then, if it wanted to argue that Ethereum was a security. By choosing not to do so, the SEC implicitly endorsed CME Group\u2019s claim that Ether is a commodity.\n\nSince then, the Commission has granted permission for ETFs to invest in ETH futures, further cementing the idea that Ethereum stands alongside Bitcoin as one of just 2 cryptocurrencies apparently considered commodities by the SEC.\n\nOf course, the potential hypocrisy of the SEC granting Ethereum commodity status while simultaneously arguing that almost every other token is a security hasn\u2019t been lost on XRP supporters.\n\nAs long as the regulator distinguishes Ethereum and the majority of altcoins, it is likely that charges of double standards will continue to abound.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs Incoming?\n\nBetween the arrival of Bitcoin futures ETFs and the SEC\u2019s approval of the first ETH futures funds, more than two years passed. Yet, with uncertainty still hanging over potential spot Bitcoin ETFs, asset managers are already lining up to launch equivalent Ethereum funds.\n\nUpdate: @vaneck_us receives a delay order on their spot #Ethereum ETF Filing. This was expected and due on December 25th. Expecting a delay order for Ark/21Shares today as well which is due on December 26th i believe. pic.twitter.com/GLTx7vCQr5 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 18, 2023\n\nAfter Blackrock fired the starting gun on the race to launch spot Ethereum ETFs in November, it was soon joined by the likes of Ark Invest and VanEck.\n\nWith the SEC due to make decisions on those applications no later than mid-Summer, Seyffart said: \u201cIt\u2019s likely to happen in 2024.\u201d"

        "content": "Lisk LSK +4.93% , a Layer 1 blockchain launched in 2016, is transitioning to the Ethereum ecosystem as a Layer 2 solution.\n\nThe new Lisk network will be powered by OP Stack, Optimism\u2019s open-source framework for developing Layer 2 chains, and built using Gelato\u2019s rollup-as-a-service platform. Lisk's Layer 2 will focus on real-world assets and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs), according to a statement.\n\n\u201cIntegrating with the Ethereum ecosystem and aligning with industry standards brings us closer to our goal of making blockchain accessible than ever before,\u201d Lisk co-founder Max Kordek said.\n\nBack in the heyday of the 2017 bull market, Lisk was a top 20 cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Fast-forward to 2023, and as the blockchain industry has matured, Lisk finds itself comparatively out of favor, falling to 272 in the rankings as its market cap declined 83% from $919 million to $152 million. With the widespread adoption of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Lisk said it now sees a better opportunity to expedite its mission by migrating to become an Ethereum Layer 2.\n\nThe testnet deployment of Lisk\u2019s Layer 2 network is scheduled for the first quarter of 2024 ahead of a mainnet launch, enabling developers to access up to 90% cheaper fees than the Ethereum mainnet, the Lisk team said.\n\nLSK token migration and airdrop\n\nThe transition also involves the migration of the LSK token to Ethereum, designed to improve its usability across various dApps and DeFi protocols in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nLisk said existing reward-sharing mechanisms for LSK will continue, with the token also used for on-chain governance in an upcoming Lisk DAO.\n\nLisk also plans an initial airdrop of LSK tokens to incentivize activity on the new chain, with more details expected leading up to its mainnet launch.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nJoining the Optimism Superchain via Gelato\n\nLisk joins Optimism and the Coinbase-incubated Layer 2 Base in utilizing the OP Stack, becoming the first Layer 1 to contribute to the development of the Optimism Superchain network of Layer 2 blockchains, the team said.\n\n\u201cLisk\u2019s transition to the OP Stack underscores our conviction that Layer 2s are the path to scaling not just Ethereum, but the blockchain movement itself,\u201d Optimism Foundation Chief Scientist Ben Jones added.\n\nLisk is also collaborating with Ethereum rollup-as-a-service platform Gelato to build the Layer 2, allowing it to deploy the OP chain in just a few clicks without writing any additional code. Gelato will let Lisk integrate infrastructure and web3 services such as block explorers, bridges and oracles from launch.\n\n\u201cUsing Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform allows the Lisk research and development team to be primarily focused on building additional products and tooling that developers and end users love, while also committing resources to the Superchain\u2019s development,\u201d Lisk Chief Project Officer Dominic Schwenter said.\n\nThe collaboration follows an expansion of Gelato\u2019s platform, also announced today, to include OP Stack support in addition to Polygon CDK.\n\n\u201cWe have known the team since our early days together in Berlin, and are excited to finally be able to work together more closely,\u201d Gelato co-founder Hilmar Orth said. \u201cBy embracing Ethereum's ecosystem and porting its existing community onto a powerful Layer 2 blockchain using Gelato, we are collectively shaping the future of web3 scalability. The Lisk ecosystem will benefit greatly from better access to liquidity, developers and sequencing fee revenue generated from its Layer 2 blockchain.\u201d\n\n\"We are excited that Gelato has extended support to the Superchain as a RaaS provider for Lisk, making it easier for developers to onboard new users into the Superchain ecosystem,\" Optimism Foundation\u2019s Ben Jones added."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market cap, has surged by over 87% since the beginning of the year. Although the growth is commendable, ETH\u2019s rise in 2023 is overshadowed by Solana\u2019s (SOL) over 500% growth and Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) over 150% growth in the same time frame. Nonetheless, analysts anticipate the asset to rally to new highs in the next bull run.\n\nETH is currently up 3% in the daily charts and 0.9% in the last week. Moreover, the token\u2019s price has surged by over 14% over the previous month.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: What Are Institutional Investors Buying?\n\nDespite the healthy rise in 2023, ETH is still down by over 50% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, which it attained on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nHow to be a millionaire when Ethereum (ETH) hits $3000?\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nReaching $3000 from current levels amounts to a growth of about 33%. To have a million dollars worth of Ethereum at $3000, you would need around 333.33 ETH tokens. The cost of 333.33 ETH at current prices is about $747,333.\n\nHowever, if ETH reaches its all-time high of $4878.26, the same investment would be worth around $1,626,000 ($1.62 million).\n\nNow, the question is whether Ethereum (ETH) will reach its all-time high again or not. The short answer is yes. There is a high chance of ETH not only hitting but surpassing its previous all-time peak.\n\nAlso Read: JP Morgan Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin in 2024\n\nAccording to Changelly, Ethereum (ETH) could surpass its all-time high by 2025. According to the platform, ETH could hit a maximum price of $5,930.32 in 2025.\n\nHowever, if the crypto markets enter a bull run in 2024, fueled by a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), Ethereum could hit a new all-time high much sooner, making some holders millionaires. All significant cryptocurrencies may hit new peaks if the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) approves one or more spot BTC ETF applications."

This represents a nearly fourfold increase in just a few days.\n\nThe protocol's total value locked (TVL) has climbed from $250 million to over $900 million following adjustments to deposit caps for liquid staking assets. EigenLayer raised its re-staking limit from 120,000 ETH to 500,000 ETH, equivalent to approximately $1.1 billion.\n\nEigenLayer enables users to deposit and \"re-stake\" ether from various liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to secure third-party networks. The protocol's stage 1 launched on the Ethereum mainnet in June. In addition to supporting LSTs from Lido, Rocket Pool, and Coinbase at launch, EigenLayer has expanded its range to include six additional LSTs: Swell's swETH, Stakewise's sETH, Stader's xETH, Origin's oETH, Ankr's ankrETH, and Wrapped Beacon Ether (wBETH).\n\nThe increase in deposit caps and the wider range of LSTs have fueled a surge in activity, with many users depositing funds to participate in the network and earn points. EigenLabs, the company behind EigenLayer, closed a $50 million Series A funding round in March, led by Blockchain Capital.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Manta Pacific, a layer-2 network currently running on Optimism\u2019s OP stack, has become the first such chain to adopt modular data availability (DA) using the newly launched Celestia mainnet.\n\nThe shift to Celestia for DA, instead of Ethereum mainnet, is expected to make transactions for Manta Pacific cheaper by at least an order of magnitude, according to core contributor Kenny Li, which should \u201cfuture-proof\u201d the chain even if demand for block space picks up in a future bull market.\n\nCurrently, a typical transaction costs around $0.24 on Manta Pacific, but Li anticipates that they can reduce that to less than $0.03 within a week or two, and a 25x savings after further adjustments in January.\n\nRead more: Celestia, the first modular data availability network, launches on mainnet\n\nLi, who co-founded p0x Labs, which is developing Manta Network, started talking with the Celestia team in the first quarter of 2023, after learning that Celestia was working on an OP stack integration, which timed out well with Manta\u2019s launch plans.\n\n\u201cBy coincidence, we were able to kind of get the stars aligned there \u2014 no pun intended,\u201d Li told Blockworks.\n\nManta Pacific\u2019s integration with Celestia utilizes data availability sampling (DAS), a mechanism that allows light nodes to verify data availability without downloading all data within a block. This method reduces costs by enabling more efficient data retrieval, effectively turning the rollup into a validium.\n\nRead more: So your layer-2 is \u2018secured by Ethereum\u2019 \u2014 what does that mean?\n\nThe adoption of modular blockchain designs involve a separation of various tasks \u2014 such as consensus, execution, data availability and settlement \u2014 across different layers, rather than handling all functions within a single chain.\n\nSince the launch of the Manta Pacific testnet in August, the Manta team decided to switch to a zkEVM based on the Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK).\n\nPolygon\u2019s own proof-of-stake chain will also migrate to a zkEVM validium rollup.\n\nThis transition, which should take place in the second quarter of 2024, will solve the user pain point of delayed withdrawals required by the fault proofs endemic to Optimistic rollups.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re looking at, first, phasing it in such that one of our phases would essentially have a multi-prover model whereby we could fall back to the fault proofs on the OP stack if anything went wrong, but also being able to bring in the zk proofs so that we can have that fast finality for the users,\u201d Li said.\n\nFault proofs on Optimism are not yet live, so the integrity of transactions relies on trusting a centralized sequencer and community vigilance.\n\nManta also relies on one centralized sequencer to post data to Celestia, and Li analogizes the planned zk-prover fallback mechanism to the use of Celestia itself.\n\n\u201cThe components we need to think about [are] resiliency, fallback options, contingency plans, and so with Celestia, the contingency here is that the fallback goes back to Ethereum\u201d for data availability, Li explained.\n\nSince DA is the main driver of transaction costs for the user, a multi-prover system should have a negligible effect.\n\nP0x Labs, the team building the Manta Network, wrapped up a $25 million Series A funding round in July.\n\nManta Pacific joins Manta Atlantic, a Polkadot parachain expected to go live in early 2024, to collectively offer a multifaceted option for the development of Web3 applications.\n\nRead more: Polkadot rethinks the economics of parachain auctions\n\nManta Atlantic focuses on zk solutions within the Polkadot ecosystem, but Li said there are synergies between the two coming.\n\n\u201cA lot of the zk components that we built out on the circuit side specifically are focused on on-chain identity, and so one of our goals right now is to bridge that on-chain identity over to the Pacific ecosystem so that people can verify without revealing any of their wallet addresses and stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nThat would include roughly 100,000 KYCd participants, he added.\n\nNative yield on ETH and USDC\n\nManta Pacific offers its own spin on the idea pioneered by Mantle and Blast to let users earn yield on their deposited ether and stablecoins while interacting with dapps on the layer-2 network.\n\nRead more: Mantle offers \u2018mETH\u2019 to the masses, as a \u2018lighter weight Lido\u2019\n\nManta relies on StakeStone a Liquid Staking Token (LST) protocol that accepts ETH and issues STONE, a non-rebasing Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) based on the LayerZero protocol, which can be used directly in DeFi dapps.\n\nStakeStone supports leading staking pools and is compatible with upcoming restaking, such as EigenLayer.\n\nSimilarly, USDC deposits are converted to the yield-bearing stablecoin (USDM) issued by Mountain Protocol. Manta will eventually enable bridging these tokens back out after an initial phase of about two months as part of a campaign, dubbed New Paradigm.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Li sees it.\n\n\u201cKudos to Blast \u2014 they\u2019ve got like 800 million TVL [total value locked] from people who could otherwise be using those assets in ways that could provide more future value,\u201d Li said, adding that Manta Pacific\u2019s TVL is about $60 million after 3 days.\n\n\u201cI do know that many other [layer-2s] are also exploring this now as well, and I think while it\u2019s interesting and novel at this moment, a year from now, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s a commodity \u2014 the feature that everyone has,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Developers of the Ethereum proof-of-work (PoW) hard fork have decided to disband.\n\nAccording to a Dec. 19 announcement, the core EthereumPoW development team will be dissolved to \u201cachieve full autonomy.\u201d Thereafter, the EthereumPoW blockchain will continue to run with PoW as the main consensus for the chain and decentralized governance \u201cto become a deity-less public chain.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, existing EthereumPoW servers will be transferred to OneDAO, a decentralized protocol on the Harmony network, for \u201ctransitional maintenance until long-term ecological partners are identified.\u201d Jadal Page, core developer of Ethereum PoW, wrote:\n\n\u201cWe have explored and validated the feasibility of ETHW operating independently without Core\u2019s support, confirming the fundamental technical and operational conditions for ETHW in such a scenario.\u201d\n\nThe EthereumPoW blockchain was hard forked from the Ethereum mainnet just prior to the completion of the Ethereum Merge upgrade in September 2022, which transferred the network from PoW to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, thereby reducing mainnet energy usage by 99%.\n\nDevelopers dissatisfied with the increased centralization of the new Ethereum PoS consensus, alongside miners upset over the loss of mining revenue, created EthereumPoW to preserve the original Ethereum.\n\nHowever, on Sept. 20, exchange-traded fund operator Grayscale Investments pulled the plug on supporting post-Merge Ethereum PoW tokens (ETHW). In its decision, Grayscale pointed out that ETHW has yet to develop \u201cmeaningful liquidity, while the products\u2019 custodian doesn\u2019t support such tokens.\u201d As a result, the firm\u2019s rights to buy and sell ETHW tokens for its clients could not be fulfilled.\n\nRelated: Ethereum community adopts ERC-3643 as standard for compliant asset tokenization\n\nETHW tokens reached an all-time high of $100 in August 2022, when they were first launched, but have now fallen to $2.59. Its total market capitalization stands at $279 million."

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is pushing back its decision on several Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to May 2024.\n\nIn multiple Dec. 18 regulatory filings, the agency delayed its decision on the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF and the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF.\n\nThe Hashdex Ether ETF aims to hold both spot Ether and futures contracts, while Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Futures ETF is seen as a \u201ctrojan horse\u201d that would corner the SEC into allowing Grayscale to convert its Ethereum Trust to a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn the filings, the agency said it was instituting proceedings that involve gathering further public input around whether or not the ETFs should be listed.\n\nThe agency also pushed back its decision on the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF and the spot Ethereum ETF lodged by Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest and 21Shares.\n\nUpdate: There it is. Delay order for @ARKInvest and @21Shares on their spot #Ethereum ETF filing. Expected and was due by December 26th. Final date for these are in late May. https://t.co/Zs6Zsd4uKj pic.twitter.com/9u0nNiPD9O \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 18, 2023\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart told Cointelegraph that these delays were very much expected and should not be cause for concern.\n\n\"This is nothing serious. Completely standard and doesn't change things positively or negatively. just part of the process and standard procedure,\" said Seyffart.\n\nHe added that the final date the regulator can decide on the ETFs will arrive in late May.\n\nUPDATE: SEC Going early with delay orders for @hashdex & @Grayscale #Ethereum ETF filings. Neither were due until Jan 1, 2024.\n\n\n\nMaybe just clearing the queue before the holidays? pic.twitter.com/LdZQxGh43L \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 18, 2023\n\nDespite the SEC having approved Ethereum futures ETFs in the past, the agency has yet to approve a spot or mixed-type product.\n\nRelated: SEC pushes deadline to decide on Grayscale spot Ether ETF\n\nMeanwhile, most of the market is focused on whether the SEC will approve 13 spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs before the agency. According to Seyffart and fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the SEC could decide as early as Jan. 10, 2024.\n\nBoth analysts have pegged the chances of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval at 90%. The markets have been buoyed by the optimism that comes with institutional access to Bitcoin. In the last six months, the price of Bitcoin has increased by more than 44%.\n\nWhile touting slightly less significant gains, Ether\u2019s price has risen 16.8% within the same time frame, per TradingView data.\n\nMagazine: Terrorism and the Israel-Gaza war have been weaponized to destroy crypto"

        "content": "In the long term, we believe ETH Network usage will be the ultimate determining factor of returns. By nearly any metric, the majority of blockchain activity occurs within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, making Ether the most utilized token. We think this positions ETH to be the greatest beneficiary of future blockchain technology adoption. Digital assets can be volatile, however, when volatility coincides with high network activity, Ethereum\u2019s well-established baseline adoption rate promotes asset stability and can exhibit a flight-to-safety quality, especially relative to other crypto assets. There are also mechanical benefits to how the Ethereum blockchain functions. The token supply is adjusted based on network activity which can reduce supply when transaction volume is high. The ETH staking reward rate also increases in periods of high activity, leading to an increased total return, if your ETH is staked. While it\u2019s difficult to net these forces out, together we believe they can amount to increased stability for asset owners."

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum price has been displaying significant strength as the price continues to trade above the pivotal support at $2000\n\nMeanwhile, a popular analyst believes the token could possibly trigger a fine bearish trend and plunge below $1000 soon\n\nThe Ethereum price has been losing momentum ever since it failed to sustain yearly highs at $2,400. Although the bulls tried hard to hold the price above $2,200, the fresh bearish interference compelled the price to drop below these levels. Besides, the crypto markets have turned extremely bearish in the short term, and hence, the major tokens are believed to trigger a decent pullback in the coming days.\n\nWhile the price is approaching the November highs, can we expect a bullish rebound?\n\nThe investors continue to remain optimistic about the upcoming trend, resulting in a notable rise in buying pressure. However, the price in the long term trades within a bearish pattern and is feared to drop hard after reaching the apex of the consolidation. A popular analyst, Peter Brandt, referring to the bearish pattern, suggests the price may witness a steep drop and even trade in a 3-digit figure soon.\n\nThe above chart indicates that the ETH price began trading within an ascending triangle after achieving the head and shoulder pattern. Technically, the price is expected to trigger a fine upswing after reaching the apex, but a majority of the chart pattern fails to follow the \u2018textbooks\u2019 that raise a higher probability of a bearish breakout. Therefore, if the ETH price confirms trading within a rising wedge pattern, then it may result in a massive price drop, leading to a price plunge to $1000 initially and later to $650."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Poised for Blastoff? 10% Breakout in Sight, But ETH Uptrend Faces a Crucial Test - CoinGape",
        "content": "Traders backed widespread recoveries across the market after many cryptocurrencies had snapped out of their uptrends on Friday. The cooldown continued during the weekend, with Ethereum price sweeping through lower support areas at $2,115.\n\nMeanwhile, growing optimism ahead of the likely approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January is keeping the crypto market not only buoyant but also bullish.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe largest smart contracts token, ETH regained momentum on Monday and was trading 4% higher on Tuesday at $2,230. Bitcoin price is equally strong, up 4.3% to $42,940 while Binance Coin (BNB), the token native to the largest crypto exchange traded 6.6% higher at $250.\n\nRead also: Crypto Price Prediction For December 19: WOO, ICP, ADA\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH Flaunts Potential Wedge Breakout\n\nThe rejection from the new 2023 high at $2,400 has seen Ethereum consolidate, creating a series of lower highs and lower lows. In other words, the token has printed a falling wedge pattern on the four-hour chart, awaiting confirmation before breaking out.\n\nThe falling wedge, in this case, is a continuation pattern, which bulls can tap to resume the uptrend targeting highs above $3,000. However, its formation alone is not enough, which means Ether price must rise above the upper falling trendline to validate the breakout.\n\nIf the immediate support at $2,230, provided by the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in red) is respected, Ethereum price would have a higher probability of breaking past the wedge pattern and rising 10% to $2,500.\n\nIf losses intensify due to more profit-taking among investors, Ethereum could tap the 20 EMA (in blue) for support to ensure that chances of the wedge pattern breakout remain high, especially with the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator sending a buy signal.\n\nFollowing the wedge pattern breakout, key milestones to look forward to start with defeating resistance at $2,260, $2,300, and $2,360. Further gains above $2,400 would call on more traders to enter long positions in Ethereum and provide additional tail force to propel the token toward $3,000.\n\nSince the Money Flow Index (MFI) is trending north above the midline (50), it can be deduced that there\u2019s more bullish pressure than selling pressure. However, the situation could change, especially if the two higher support areas at the 20 EMA and 50 EMA weaken.\n\nIf push comes to shove, some traders may decide to close their positions based on their risk tolerance, and wait to buy ETH again when it finally taps a solid support, for instance, the 200 EMA (purple) at $42,150.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Solana, the blockchain platform launched in 2020, has achieved a significant milestone, trailing Ethereum in 24-hour decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. This historic accomplishment has garnered widespread attention from crypto leaders and enthusiasts alike, signaling a notable shift in the dynamics of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nAs the news reverberates through the crypto space, additional elements of Solana\u2019s success come to light. The celebration extends beyond DEX volume triumphs, with the entire Saga Mobile inventory selling out.\n\nThis unexpected surge in demand underscores the growing popularity of Solana-based projects. Furthermore, the meme coin BONK, associated with the ecosystem, has broken multiple records, adding a touch of exuberance to the community\u2019s festivities.\n\nWow, what a day \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 We\u2019ve officially SOLD OUT of Saga phones in the US!

As of this writing, Solana\u2019s weekly change was 37.10%, whereas Ethereum had a decrease of more than 4%.\n\nSOL new record trading volume. Source: DefiLlama\n\nSolana has been growing at an impressive rate this year; earlier this month, it overtook Ethereum in the NFT sales figure. The digital currency achieved this run at a time when its future appeared unstable after the implosion of FTX and the attendant SOL sell-offs, while having the biggest growth margin among the top 15 cryptocurrencies year-to-date.\n\nSOL trails ETH by a close margin. Source: DefiLlama\n\nA multitude of factors played a role in reaching this significant milestone. It includes significant purchases of Solana Mobile, high trading volumes on the dog-themed joke coin BONK, and optimistic views about the Solana ecosystem.\n\nMany have referred to this outstanding accomplishment as a rare occurrence, and Anatoly Yakovenko, the founder of Solana, expressed his surprise at reaching the enormous milestone.\n\nSOL market cap currently at $29 billion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nPositive Achievements\n\nThe announcement of Solana\u2019s sale of Saga Mobile is a \u201chuge day for Solana,\u201d according to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire.\n\nRaj Gokal of Solana responded to these achievements by remarking, \u201cIncredible milestone. 6 years in, just getting started!\u201d\n\nCoinMarketCap data shows that BONK surpassed expectations with a spectacular gain, displaying an exponential leap of 100% within 24 hours.\n\nThe coin\u2019s entry onto major exchanges coincided with this exponential escalation, which excited investors wanting to experience the exhilarating rollercoaster ride.\n\nMeanwhile, a sell-off is causing Solana\u2019s price to startlingly buckle under its own weight. As of this writing, CoinMarketCap data shows that Solana is trading at $74, a 5.65% decrease in value.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum, has recently shown signs of a new correction phase that began in the second week of December. From its high of $2400, the coin price experienced a 10% drop, bringing it down to its current trading level of $2158. This decline is particularly significant as it suggests a potential breach below the support trendlines of the rising channel pattern, thereby indicating a risk of a further correction for ETH.\n\nAlso Read: Peter Brandt Stirs Debate with Harsh Critique of Ethereum\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill Market Correction Push ETH Below $2000\n\nA recent breakdown below the support trendline indicates the correction trend is likely to be prolonged.\n\nA healthy retracement in ETH price keeps the overall trend bullish.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.2 Billion, indicating a 45% gain.\n\nOver the last two months, the Ethereum price recovery was encapsulated within a rising channel pattern, characterized by its movement between two parallel trendlines offering dynamic resistance and support.\n\nHowever, the recent sell-off in the crypto market has led to a breakdown below the lower trendline of this pattern, hinting at a likelihood of an upcoming correction. Should the daily candle close beneath this breached trendline, it would empower sellers, potentially driving prices even lower.\n\nA post-breakdown decline could result in a further 10% decrease in price, potentially reaching a combined support level at $1920, which aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nNonetheless, a correction to this Fibonacci level could still be considered a healthy market adjustment, providing a solid base for a potential rebound. If the ETH price bounces back from this level, it would suggest that the current correction has recuperated the exhausted bullish momentum setting the stage for the next phase of recovery.\n\nEthereum- Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM)\n\nThe Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) metric for Ethereum offers an optimistic perspective. Currently, 70.18% of Ethereum addresses are \u2018in the money\u2019 (profiting), while 24.9% are \u2018out of the money\u2019 (at a loss). This distribution suggests a relatively stable investor base, which could be less inclined towards panic selling, thereby potentially supporting a sustained bullish trend in the future\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The ETH price decisive breakdown below the 20-day EMA after two months of trading above it indicates an uptick in selling pressure within the market.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): The daily RSI , hovering around the 50% mark, reflects a neutral sentiment among traders."

If I had any faith that we would get a Simpson Bowles amendment to balance the budget or have any fiscal prudence, I wouldn\u2019t be as bullish on Bitcoin. But I just don\u2019t, and we\u2019re going into an election year.\n\nSo you\u2019ll have a Fed cutting with a 5% budget deficit and a projected 5% budget deficit next year and the following year. If people start shifting 1% of their portfolio, institutions, 1%, not 10, just 1, there isn\u2019t a lot of supply in Bitcoin or Ethereum.\u201d\n\nNovogratz, an early Ethereum investor, says that Bitcoin is entering an unprecedented supply and demand dynamic that he believes could easily put BTC well above its previous all-time high.\n\n\u201cWe have customers that are platform customers and buy enough Bitcoin every day to take out all the miners. So when you think about the supply/demand dynamic, we haven\u2019t really had a situation where you have a global market and something of such limited supply. And so I think Bitcoin can go far higher. I think the first stop next year will be the old highs, $69,000, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it went beyond that.\u201d\n\nBTC is worth $42,411 at time of writing, while ETH is trading for $2,194.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A closely followed crypto analyst says that one Ethereum (ETH) rival that has exploded about 600% year to date is gearing up to spark another move to the upside.\n\nIn a new video update, the host of InvestAnswers tells his 458,000 YouTube subscribers that smart contract platform Solana (SOL) has a lot more gas left in the tank despite already posting huge gains this year.\n\nThe analyst is looking at Solana\u2019s dominance, which tracks how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to SOL. According to the InvestAnswers host, he sees SOL\u2019s dominance rising to 3% in the next market expansion, indicating that SOL has more room to grow.\n\n\u201cRegarding the Solana dominance so far this year, [what] blew me away is we\u2019re at nearly 2.2%. The all-time high for Solana on dominance was like 2.5% or something, so again we are so early yet the dominance of Solana is going through the roof.\n\nThe question is: what happens if the [crypto] market cap goes to $5 trillion?\n\n\u2026Within 18 months or 24 months, or maybe even a year, we could hit a $5 trillion market cap \u2013 a lot of that will be driven by Bitcoin of course, but I do expect SOL dominance to hit at least 3%. So the question is, if [the] CMC (crypto market cap) goes to $5 trillion [and] SOL dominance goes to 3%, what is the price of SOL?\u201d\n\nThe strategist goes on to calculate SOL\u2019s potential price, factoring in the variables of a $5 trillion total crypto market cap and a 3% dominance rating for Solana. According to the host, Solana should reach the $363 price tag.\n\n\u201cIf CMC goes to $5 trillion, then that means the market cap of SOL goes to $150 billion and the current SOL market cap is $31 billion, and that is a 4.84x [increase] from where we are today. [That figure] times $75 that would take [Solana\u2019s] price to a ridiculous $363.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $69.31 at time of writing.

ETH is up over 3% and the price could gain pace if it clears the $2,250 resistance.\n\nEthereum is moving higher from the $2,120 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $2,210 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could climb further higher if it clears the $2,250 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Restarts Increase\n\nEthereum price extended its decline below the $2,150 level. ETH remained strong above the $2,120 level. A low was formed near $2,116 and the price started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move above the $2,150 and $2,200 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,332 swing high to the $2,116 low. There was also a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $2,210 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $2,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,250 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,332 swing high to the $2,116 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key resistance is near the $2,280 level. A clear move above the $2,280 zone could send the price toward the $2,330 level. The next resistance sits at $2,400. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,550 level, above which Ethereum might rally and test the $2,750 zone.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,250 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,210 level or the 100 hourly SMA.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,200 zone. A downside break and a close below $2,200 might start another major decline. In the stated case, Ether could revisit the $2,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,000 level in the coming days.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,200\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,250\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "On Dec. 16, the trading volume of decentralized exchanges (DEX) on Solana briefly flipped that of Ethereum for the first time amid the continued growth of the smart-contract-enabled blockchain ecosystem.\n\nData from DeFillama shows that the trading volume of DEXs on the blockchain reached $1.536 billion, while Ethereum stood at only $1.164 billion during the period.\n\nSeveral community members hailed the development, with Solana\u2019s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko saying:\n\n\u201cI am just pacing around the house and saying whoa over and over at this point.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s daily volume has since returned to its dominant position, with $945 million recorded during the past day, while that of Solana stood at $940 million as of press time.\n\nHowever, the brief flipping of Dec. 16 indicates the robust growth and widespread adoption of Solana\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nAs it stands, DEX volume on the blockchain is on course to exceed $10 billion for December, making it the most prolific month on record for the network, per DeFillama data.\n\nBonk, USDC driving Solana volume\n\nCryptoSlate\u2019s analysis of the Orca exchange\u2019s volume, the largest Solana-based DEX, showed that a significant portion of these trading activities came from the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin and the Bonk memecoin.\n\nBONK is the first dog-themed coin on Solana, bringing renewed attention and interest to the blockchain network. CryptoSlate reported that the digital asset added more than $1 billion to its market capitalization within a day last week, making it the third-largest memecoin by market capitalization, behind only Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.\n\nInterest in the meme asset also resulted in Solana\u2019s blockchain-enabled Saga smartphones selling out over the weekend. Reports have revealed that the secondary sales of these phones on eBay were going for as much as $5,000.\n\nOn the other hand, Circle\u2019s CEO Jeremy Allaire previously revealed that 90% of all stablecoin transaction volume on Solana was USDC. USDC is the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization.\n\nMeanwhile, Helium\u2019s MOBILE token is another asset enjoying widespread attention from the Solana community. Trading in the asset has increased more than 70% during the past day, with its price rising 71% to $0.006621 as of press time."

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on several Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) until May 2024.\n\nThis announcement came through regulatory filings made on Dec. 18. Among the delayed decisions are those concerning the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF, and a spot Ethereum ETF proposed by Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest and 21Shares.\n\nUPDATE: SEC Going early with delay orders for @hashdex & @Grayscale #Ethereum ETF filings. Neither were due until Jan 1, 2024.\n\n\n\nMaybe just clearing the queue before the holidays? pic.twitter.com/LdZQxGh43L \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 18, 2023\n\nThe Hashdex Ether ETF is unique in its approach, aiming to incorporate both spot Ether and futures contracts. Meanwhile, Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Futures ETF is perceived as a strategic move to eventually convert its Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF, a view that has gained significant attention within the industry.\n\nThe SEC has declared that it will initiate proceedings to gather more public input regarding the potential listing of these ETFs, a move that underscores the agency\u2019s commitment to thorough scrutiny and public engagement before making a final decision.\n\nYou might also like: SEC postpones decision on Grayscale\u2019s application for spot Ethereum ETF\n\nJames Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, indicated that these delays were anticipated, with final decisions from the regulator expected by late May.\n\nUpdate: There it is. Delay order for @ARKInvest and @21Shares on their spot #Ethereum ETF filing. Expected and was due by December 26th. Final date for these are in late May. https://t.co/Zs6Zsd4uKj pic.twitter.com/9u0nNiPD9O \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 18, 2023\n\nSeyffart\u2019s insights align with the broader market expectations, as the community has been closely following the SEC\u2019s stance on cryptocurrency-based ETFs.\n\nPreviously, the SEC has approved ether futures-based ETFs but has stopped short of greenlighting spot ether or mixed fund ETFs. Notably, in October, nine futures-based products received approval simultaneously, marking a significant development in the industry.\n\nThe ongoing debate and anticipation in the crypto sector extend beyond Ethereum ETFs. The market is closely observing the SEC\u2019s decisions regarding 13 spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs currently under review.\n\nBloomberg analysts Seyffart and Eric Balchunas suggest that a decision on these Bitcoin ETFs could come as early as Jan. 10, 2024.\n\nBoth analysts have estimated a 90% likelihood of the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. This high probability has injected optimism into the market, particularly regarding institutional access to Bitcoin.\n\nOver the last six months, Bitcoin has seen a price increase of over 44%, while Ether (ETH) has also experienced a notable rise of 16.8% in the same period, as per data by CoinMarketCap.\n\nInvestors and industry experts have expressed concerns that delays in approving Ethereum ETFs are hindering market development and limiting investors\u2019 access to diversified investment opportunities.\n\nHowever, the SEC maintains its stance on thorough evaluation to prevent fraudulent activities and protect investor interests.\n\nAs the crypto community awaits the SEC\u2019s final decisions, the agency encourages public participation in commenting on the proposed rule changes for Ethereum ETFs. This involvement is seen as a vital part of the regulatory process, shaping the future landscape of cryptocurrency investments in the US market.\n\nRead more: SEC postpones deadline for decision on Invesco Galaxy spot Ethereum ETF\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

I\u2019m going to just hold my SOL and chill.\u201d\n\nUsing Fibonacci retracement levels, the trader suggests Solana may retest $48.71 before a bounce.\n\nSolana is trading for $73.37 at time of writing, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader predicts that ETH rival Avalanche (AVAX) will undergo a correction and revisit levels below $30 following its recent massive rally.\n\n\u201cAVAX: things are looking kind of toppy in the short term. Still bullish on this in the longer term for 2024 but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this cools to sub $30.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he appears to suggest that AVAX is about to lose key support around the $39 level.\n\nAVAX is trading for $39.88 at time of writing, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader believes that Dogecoin (DOGE) rival Bonk (BONK) is entering a distribution phase or a period where early investors take the time to unload their holdings to sell their coins at a relatively high price.\n\n\u201cBONK: not shorting this quite yet, wouldn\u2019t dismiss having some sort of scam pump on this one. That\u2019ll be the one to consider shorting, to be honest. I think that this is in its distribution phase for now though.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) whales have been aggressively buying the dip.\n\nThe recent whale activity hints at the possibility of higher ETH prices.\n\nExperts have predicted that ETH will outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in 2024.\n\nFollowing a strong start to December 2023, the prices of several crypto assets, including Ethereum (ETH), have since cooled down. Despite the recent price corrections, recent ETH whale activity suggests a firm belief in a bullish continuation.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Whales Accumulate $230M in ETH\n\nEthereum\u2019s largest whales have been on a buying spree despite lackluster price movements. In an X post on Saturday, December 16, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that this class of investors with holdings between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 ETH had accumulated over 100,000 ETH in the past week worth a staggering $230 million.\n\nSome of the largest #Ethereum whales have been on a buying spree, scooping up over 100,000 $ETH in just the past week \u2013 that's a whopping $230 million! pic.twitter.com/jWHY6MXDgs \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 16, 2023\n\nThe recent whale accumulation suggests that these investors expect prices to rally higher, an outcome that typically follows significant buying pressure from these large investors.

Bulls will hope that this level holds to strengthen the possibility of one more upswing before the end of 2023. A break below could suggest the formation of a more complex bullish continuation chart pattern like a bull flag, which could appear as a descending channel on smaller time frames, which could dash hopes of another strong rally in 2023.\n\nETH/USD daily candle price chart.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) vs Retik Finance (RETIK), how will these two giants perform in 2024? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) vs Retik Finance (RETIK), how will these two giants perform in 2024?\n\nThe cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, with new projects and innovations emerging to challenge the established giants. In this article, we\u2019ll delve into the performance expectations for Ethereum (ETH) and Retik Finance (RETIK) in 2024, exploring their unique features, potential upgrades, and what analysts are predicting for these two blockchain giants.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Evolution with Proof-of-Stake\n\n\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been undergoing a significant transformation. One of the most anticipated developments for Ethereum is its transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This transition is part of Ethereum 2.0, a major upgrade aimed at improving scalability, security, and energy efficiency.\n\nIn the proof-of-stake system, miners of Ethereum will rely on Ether holders, who will act as validators, thus lending more assurance to the system. In essence, proof-of-stake allows holders of Ether to lock up their funds as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks, reducing the need for extensive computation and energy consumption.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance PresaleThis transition to PoS is expected to have several positive implications for Ethereum in 2024:\n\nEnhanced Scalability\n\nEthereum has faced scalability challenges, especially during periods of high demand. With Ethereum 2.0\u2019s PoS mechanism, the network aims to increase its capacity to process a higher number of transactions per second (TPS). This scalability improvement could boost Ethereum\u2019s appeal for various use cases, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nReduced Energy Consumption\n\nProof-of-stake is more energy-efficient compared to proof-of-work. As Ethereum transitions to PoS, it is likely to become more environmentally friendly, aligning with the growing focus on sustainable blockchain solutions. This shift could attract environmentally conscious investors and users.\n\nLower Transaction Costs\n\nEthereum has faced challenges with high gas fees, which can make transactions costly, particularly during network congestion. Ethereum\u2019s planned upgrade, known as EIP-4844, aims to address this issue by optimizing gas usage. It is speculated that transaction costs could fall significantly, potentially as low as $0.01, making Ethereum more accessible for users and developers.\n\nMarket Share Growth\n\nThe combination of enhanced scalability, reduced energy consumption, and lower transaction costs positions Ethereum as a strong contender for gaining more market share. Analysts anticipate that Ethereum might outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in 2024 in terms of growth rate, potentially attracting a broader user base and more institutional interest.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nRetik Finance\u2019s Potential to Outperform\n\n\n\nWhile Ethereum is poised for growth and development in 2024, Retik Finance (RETIK) is another project that has been gaining attention in the DeFi space. Retik Finance positions itself as a blockchain platform that bridges the gap between traditional and digital finance.\n\nHere are some factors that contribute to Retik Finance\u2019s potential to outperform Ethereum and other tokens:\n\nUnique Utility\n\nRetik Finance offers a range of unique and practical solutions, including DeFi debit cards that allow users to spend cryptocurrency in real-world transactions. The integration of Retik Pay, a crypto payment processor, provides a seamless way for online stores and businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments with low transaction fees.\n\nStrong Community Support\n\nRetik Finance has cultivated a passionate and engaged community of supporters who believe in the project\u2019s vision. Community-driven development and active engagement are key factors that can contribute to the project\u2019s success.\n\nUpcoming Listing Potential\n\nRetik Finance is gearing up for listings, which could significantly increase its visibility and accessibility to a broader audience of investors. The potential for a listing surge is an attractive prospect for those looking to invest in promising blockchain projects.\n\nHigh Growth Potential\n\nAnalysts have made bold predictions about Retik Finance\u2019s price potential, suggesting a potential price surge of up to 20,000%. While such predictions should be approached with caution, they underscore the optimism surrounding the project.\n\nReal-World Integration\n\nRetik Finance\u2019s emphasis on real-world integration sets it apart from many other DeFi projects. This practical approach to cryptocurrency usage aligns with the growing demand for everyday financial solutions.\n\nConclusion: A Dynamic Crypto Landscape\n\n\n\nThe year 2024 promises to be an exciting one for the cryptocurrency market, with Ethereum and Retik Finance among the projects to watch. Ethereum\u2019s transition to Ethereum 2.0 and the potential benefits of PoS make it a compelling choice for investors and developers. Analysts anticipate strong growth and increased market share for Ethereum.\n\nOn the other hand, Retik Finance\u2019s unique utility, strong community support, and potential price surge set it on a path to outperforming other tokens. As it gears up for listings and continues its development, Retik Finance could make significant strides in bridging the gap between traditional and digital finance.\n\nUltimately, both Ethereum and Retik Finance represent dynamic opportunities in the evolving world of blockchain and decentralized finance. Investors and enthusiasts should closely monitor their progress and consider their respective features and potential for growth in 2024 and beyond.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance PresaleVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance"

        "content": "Legendary crypto trader, Peter Brandt has proven that he is truly bearish on Ethereum (ETH) after he revealed he just shorted the industry\u2019s second-largest digital currency.\n\nEthereum (ETH) FUD Looming Large\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a digital currency with a dedicated community but also committed critics like Peter Brandt. Currently trading for $2,162.05, down by 2.28% in the past 24 hours. Though the trading volume is elevated at 47.27% to $9,967,236,941, Peter Brandt is convinced that Ethereum\u2019s price is fated to slide further.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTaking to the X app, Peter Brandt acknowledged that while classical chart patterns are not sacred as they fail to perform by the books at all times, should Ethereum comply with the bearish script in the chart that accompanied his post, then the digital currency might plunge to new lows in the near term.\n\nPer his forecast, Ethereum could drop as low as $1,000, and on the worst-case basis, it may drop to $650. Riding on his forecast for Ethereum in the long term, Peter Brandt said he has shorted the coin and that he has \u201ca protective B/E stop.\u201d\n\nAs a prominent figure and analyst in the crypto ecosystem, Peter Brandt\u2019s projection carries a lot of weight that may impact trader\u2019s sentiment regarding Ethereum (ETH). While nothing is impossible in the crypto world, it is worth noting that Ethereum has not dropped below the $1000 price mark since at least January 2021.\n\nOdds of Ethereum Correcting?\n\nPer the current price outlook, Ethereum has been on a major correction path for some days now. The digital currency has given up the gains accrued from earlier in the month when it traded as high as $2,401.76. While the likelihood of further decline cannot be ruled out, Ethereum has some important fundamentals to help boost its resilience across the board.\n\nOne of the most important of these fundamentals is the growing clamor and application for the Ethereum Spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) product by top investment managers like BlackRock. Just like Bitcoin spot ETF, approval of this product is poised to usher in massive institutional capital which might impact the demand and ultimately the price of the coin.\n\nWhile Ethereum may correct in the short term in line with Peter Brandt\u2019s projection, the longer-term outlook of the coin looks promising."

        "content": "Ethereum Smart Contract Framework Updated to Combat Security Concerns\n\nEthereum is one of the most widely used blockchain networks globally. Recent findings from CoinMarketCap show that Ethereum has the highest number of total developers, accounting for 16% of all developers in the crypto sector.\n\nUnfortunately, the Ethereum network has also become extremely prone to security exploits. Blockchain security firm Beosin found in its \u201cGlobal Web3 Security Report \u201d that crypto investors lost $282.96 million to rug pulls during quarter three of this year. The report further noted that phishing schemes generated $66.15 million during the same time period. According to findings from Beosin, the Ethereum blockchain underwent the most losses and incidents overall.\n\nUpdated framework for reviewing smart contract code\n\n\n\nChaals Nevile, technical program director at the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) \u2014 an organization that aims to drive the use of enterprise ethereum as an open standard \u2014 told Cryptonews that there are known problems within Ethereum that are impacting the ecosystem\u2019s security. \u201cThe most obvious problem is that the Solidity compiler \u2013 which outputs byte code and other artifacts needed for deployment of smart contracts \u2013 has bugs. As the compiler evolves, old bugs are fixed, but new ones are also created,\u201d said Nevile.\n\nIn order to address this and other challenges, the EEA established the \u201cEthTrust Security Levels Working Group in November 2020.\u201d In August 2022, the group released the publication of the \u201cEthTrust Security Levels Specification v1.\u201d This specification has since served as a framework for developers, organizations and customers leveraging and reviewing smart contract code written in Solidity, Ethereum\u2019s main programming language.\n\nYet as the Ethereum network continues to advance, Nevile pointed out that the EthTrust Security Levels Specification required updates to reflect ongoing and new security developments. \u201cFor instance, the v1 specification covers bugs up to about the year 2022, yet new bugs were discovered after we released v1,\u201d he said.\n\nThis in mind, Nevile shared that today the EEA announced the release of Version 2.0 of its EthTrust Security Levels Specification. Neville noted that the EthTrust Security Levels Specification v2 addresses issues such as newly discovered bugs in the Solidity compiler, treatment of rounding errors, more vigorous treatment of read-only reentrancy attacks and more.\n\nUpdates are critical, as the Ethereum ecosystem has fallen victim to security exploits in the past due to these specific issues. For instance, Michael Lewellen, head of solutions architecture at OpenZeppelin \u2013 a security firm building an open-source framework to secure smart contracts \u2013 told Cryptonews that \u201cThe DAO\u201d hack occurred due to reentrancy. \u201cThe DAO Hack was the original big hack on Ethereum that happened in 2016 and got everyone thinking more about security. This was a classic case of reentrancy,\u201d Lewellen said. The DAO hack resulted in a loss of $3.64 million in ETH.\n\nNevile explained that reentrancy occurs when a developer starts a smart contract and then requests for the program to do something different while it is in the middle of running code. He said:\n\n\u201cEssentially this means that a program is halfway through running code, but then something else is asked of it. As a result, the two requests could get mixed up. A program hacker can then use this mix up as an opportunity to steal people\u2019s money or change the prompt of things.\u201d\n\nWill an industry standard be widely adopted?\n\n\n\nAware of the severity behind such incidents, Lewellen pointed out that OpenZeppelin leverages the EthTrust Security Levels v1 framework to prevent such security vulnerabilities from occurring. \u201cWe use this framework as a pre-audit assessment for many of our clients. This allows clients to know that we are checking for certain instances during the audit process.\u201d\n\nThis industry standard seems to be helpful, as an anonymous OpenZeppelin client revealed to Cryptonews that EthTrust is what the company had been lacking in the past. The source said:\n\n\u201cWe failed our previous security audit because we didn\u2019t have clear guidance on what security requirements we were missing. We feel much more confident going into our next audit after reviewing the EthTrust requirements and implementing them in our codebase.\u201d\n\nYet Nevile commented that while feedback for the EthTrust standard v1 has been positive, it remains challenging getting developers and organizations to know that such an open standard exists. He also noted that the framework is best suited for newer Ethereum projects. He said:\n\n\u201cProjects like Uniswap, Aave and others may look at these specifications and find them to be useful, but for the most part it\u2019s common knowledge for them. Projects that are just now being developed and going to production on Ethereum will likely find these specifications to be valuable.\u201d\n\nHowever, the question remains whether or not such an industry standard will help prevent security exploits on Ethereum moving forward. John Wingate, founder and chief executive officer of BankSocial \u2013 a financial services company that leverages blockchain technology \u2013 told Cryptonews that the changing nature of industry standards is problematic. \u201cStandards are always changing; languages are always depreciating methods, variables, data types, and object types,\u201d he said.\n\nThis concern in mind, Nevile shared that version 3 of the EthTrust specification is already in the works. \u201cWe are roughly 16 months between publications. I think that 12 to 18 months is a frequent enough revision to ensure that we don\u2019t fall out of date.\u201d\n\nAlthough this may be, Wingate believes that repeatable, automated testing is the only way to make sure decentralized applications are adhering to best practices that may prevent security exploits.

        "content": "In the ever-evolving crypto landscape, it\u2019s like the Wild West out there, and leading the charge are Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA), as well as one new rising star.\n\nThe new kid on the block is called Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) and like each of the above players, brings something unique to the table, offering investors a chance to dive into what could be something new and exciting.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Holding Steady Despite the Ups and Downs\n\nEthereum, the big brother of the altcoin family, is currently hovering near a crucial support level. For those not in the crypto know-how, think of this as a \u201cmake or break\u201d point. If Ethereum manages to hold its ground above this level, it could be looking at a comeback story. But if it dips below, it might signal a time to buckle up for a bit of a rough ride. Despite this, Ethereum remains a top crypto by market cap, given its long-standing reputation and consistent performance.\n\nCardano (ADA): The Underdog Gaining Ground\n\nThen there\u2019s Cardano. It\u2019s like the little engine that could of the crypto world. Recently, ADA\u2019s price jumped from $0.4 to $0.5, boosting its ecosystem with over $100 million. This spike in TVL (Total Value Locked) has shot Cardano up the ranks, beating out some big names like Bitcoin in TVL standings. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that Cardano is in a hot zone where significant numbers of wallets have hoarded billions of ADA. If it stays above this zone, we might see Cardano hit new yearly highs. So, keep an eye out, as this might be one of the top altcoins to buy.\n\nRebel Satoshi ($RBLZ): The New Kid on the Block\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the new kid on the block, Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ). This isn\u2019t just another memecoin; it\u2019s a token with a cause, inspired by the anonymity of Satoshi Nakamoto and the defiance of Guy Fawkes. $RBLZ isn\u2019t just about making a quick buck. It\u2019s about being part of a movement, a community that stands against the conventional financial system. This token is gaining traction, offering more than just laughs \u2013 it\u2019s about making a statement.\n\nThe Rebel Satoshi Presale\n\nWhat\u2019s cooking in the presale world? Rebel Satoshi\u2019s presale, that\u2019s what- with over 53,169,981 $RBLZ already sold. The presale offers an opportunity to get in on the project early. The Rebel Satoshi ecosystem isn\u2019t just about trading tokens; it\u2019s about staking, NFTs, and being part of a community that has a voice in the project\u2019s future.\n\nRebel Satoshi offers a chance to be part of something bigger. It\u2019s a rebellion against the status quo, wrapped up in the fun and excitement of a memecoin.\n\nIn conclusion, the altcoin universe is buzzing with activity, with Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) leading the pack. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned crypto investor or just dipping your toes in, these platforms offer a mix of stability and the excitement of being part of something new and interesting.\n\nAs we watch Ethereum hovers near its key support level and Cardano climb the TVL ranks, the Rebel Satoshi presale stands out. For those looking to add some spice to their portfolio, $RBLZ is there. So, gear up, do your research, and decide for yourself.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram.\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "Ethereum insider Lane Rettig makes strong allegations about ETH ICO, claiming that 70% of all ETH in existence was distributed in the pre-mine.\n\nLane Rettig, a former Ethereum core developer, recently caused a stir among crypto investors following his recent accusations against the team behind Ethereum.\n\n70% of ETH Supply Was Distributed During Pre-Mine\n\nIn a video making the rounds, Rettig alleged that 70% of ETH supply was distributed during the pre-mine several years back. Notably, he pointed out the figure has recently dropped to about 60%.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the right numbers, 10%, 15%, 20%, you can draw the line wherever you want. 80%, 70%, 60%, it is just too much by almost an order of magnitude,\u201d he added.\n\n????BOMBSHELL ALERT????\n\nLane Rettig, former ethereum core developer, on the Ewasm team at the Ethereum Foundation\n\n?ETHGATE Is THE Financial Scandal of the Century\n\nBIGGER Than Enron. BIGGER than FTX. BIGGER than Madoff. BIGGER than MF Global. BIGGER than Theranos.??\u2026 pic.twitter.com/7CRARuWCKJ \u2014 Digital Asset Investor.XRP (@digitalassetbuy) December 16, 2023\n\nNo One Knows ETH Biggest Holders\u2019 Identity\n\nAside from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s ETH holdings, Rettig noted that nobody knows the true identity of the biggest ETH holders. However, he noted that a very small number of people fall under the category of biggest ETH holders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors that are totally anecdotal like a very small number of individuals, like one or two people single handedly bought up large percentages of pre-mine ETH because they were able to participate pseudonymously,\u201d Rettig was quoted as saying.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the crypto community has been asking major questions about the transparency of ETH\u2019s Initial Coin Offering (ICO).\n\nLast year, a video surfaced showing Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin advising early Ethereum investors to disguise themselves during ETH ICO by creating multiple pseudonymous identities. The rationale behind this advice was to avoid scaring the public.\n\nNotably, Rettig, who was among Ethereum\u2019s core developers, explained that he left the Ethereum Foundation mainly because of the incidents that occurred during the ETH pre-mine.\n\nAfter working with the Ethereum Foundation for a year and six months, Rettig claimed he realized that he was \u201cpumping Joe Lubin\u2019s bag,\u201d a major shift from what he wanted in his career.\n\nNot New\n\nRettig is not the first ex-Ethereum Foundation employee to make strong allegations about the ETH ICO. Recall that former Ethereum advisor Steven Nerayoff has leveled fraudulent allegations against the ETH team.\n\nAs reported earlier, Nerayoff alleged that both Buterin and Lubin sabotaged crypto and engaged in a fraudulent initial coin offering. He also claimed that the corruption that happened at Ethereum during ETH ICO was 1,000 times bigger than the FTX fraud."

Those transfers have amounted to 11,200 ETH in total worth $24 million.\n\nJust now, #GalaxyDigital has deposited a total of 11.2K $ETH ($24.3M) to #binance.\n\n\n\nTill now, they have deposited a total of 31437 $ETH ($71M) to exchanges. pic.twitter.com/C3PPKmTHcf \u2014 The Data Nerd (@OnchainDataNerd) December 18, 2023\n\n@OnchainDataNerd added that this was not the only ETH chunk sold by Galaxy Digital recently. In total, Mike Novogratz\u2019s company has disposed of a much bigger amount of ETH \u2013 roughly 31,437 coins, amounting to approximately $71 million.\n\nDormant Ethereum wallet awakens\n\nAnother source of on-chain data on the Twitter/X app, @lookonchain Smart Money tracker, recently reported that a whale that had stayed inactive for one year has awakened and began selling his/her Ethereum on a decentralized exchange.\n\nA whale that has been dormant for 1 year is dumping $ETH on #DEX!\n\n\n\nSo far, 18,865 $ETH has been sold for 42M $DAI through 4 new wallets, the average selling price is $2,229.\n\n\n\nAnd currently has 5,588 $ETH($12.5M) left. pic.twitter.com/K6znM7pxxh \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 16, 2023\n\nThis Ether holder sold 18,865 Ethereum for 42,000,000 DAI stablecoins using four newly-created wallets. The whale sold all this Ethereum at an average price of $2,229. At the time of this writing, this massive crypto holder has 5,588 ETH left worth $12.5 million.\n\nOverall, as the Ethereum price continues dumping now, the whale activity of the second largest cryptocurrency has increased. Earlier today, a whale withdrew a staggering 60,000 ETH (evaluated at $131.76 million) from Bitfinex and borrowed 58 million DAI from Maker with some of that money. Then, they swapped the borrowed stablecoins to 58 million USDC and deposited them to Binance.\n\nWhale Alert cryptocurrency tracker spotted several massive Ethereum transactions.\n\nA total of 21,000 ETH was transferred from OKEx to Binance. The amount of 20,000 ETH was sent from an anonymous wallet to BitFlyer, and an unknown wallet deposited 15,839 ETH to the Binance exchange. Overall, all this Ethereum was moved in five transactions, worth almost $119 million in total.\n\nAfter rising 7.7% last week and hitting $2,317, Ethereum declined over the weekend and lost approximately 8%, exchanging hands at $2,131 at the time of this writing."

        "title": "Ethereum Bearish Falling Wedge Pattern Appears, How Low Can Price Go? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum has followed the general trend of Bitcoin over the last few weeks and when the asset dipped from its 2023 peak, so did the price of ETH. Following this decline in price, a worrying pattern has appeared on the ETH chart known as a falling wedge pattern. This was brought to light by crypto analyst Alan Santana, who has painted a grim picture of what this could mean for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Falling Wedge Pattern Is Bearish\n\nIn the analysis posted on the TradingView website, Alan Santana explains that the appearance of this falling wedge pattern does not bode well for the Ethereum price. Apparently, the ETH chart had formed a perfect rising wedge which eventually broke bearish. Given this, the crypto analyst explains that it shows that the Ethereum price is moving alongside the rest of the crypto market in a \u201cnormal but fast correction.\u201d\n\nThe crypto analyst also backs up their analysis with the Ethereum Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator. In the chart shared by the analyst, there is a clear decline in the MACD on the daily chart, which lends credence to the bearish pressure mounting on ETH.\n\nFurthermore, using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart as well, there is also a clear decline. The RSI has apparently already lost its trend line support and is now moving below 50. The simple fact suggests a turn toward the bearish direction for the cryptocurrency.\n\nSantana explains that these indicators show that the bias toward a downward spiral is strong, especially since it has already seen a double-top pattern. \u201cVolume continues to drop, the calm before the storm. Slowly, slowly down\u2026 Nothing is happening, everything is good then Boom!\u201d the analyst warns.\n\nETH price above $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nPrice Targets For ETH\u2019s Bearish Formation\n\nFrom the chart posted in the analysis, the crypto analyst seems to expect at least a 20% drawdown for Ethereum following the double-top formation. Now, the chart puts the double top formation when the asset\u2019s price briefly touched the $2,400 level last week.\n\nAfter that, expectations have quickly gone in the opposite direction and as the formation plays out, the crypto analyst sees a decline to at least $1,800 from here. If further downside follows, then Santana expects that there will be more drawdowns that will end somewhere around $1,600.\n\nThe Ethereum price is still trending around $2,200 at the time of writing, suggesting the bear pressure is still mounting. If it breaks down from here, then Santana\u2019s prediction could prove right and ETH\u2019s price could fall back to mid-October levels.\n\nFeatured image from Crypto Briefing, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "ETH was down by more than 3% in the last seven days.\n\nMarket indicators and metrics remained bearish.\n\nThe price of Ethereum [ETH] has constantly plummeted, which might have sparked concerns among investors. However, as per the latest data, this price action might hold better things, as the token\u2019s price might skyrocket soon.\n\nEthereum is still under bears\u2019 pressure\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH\u2019s price has fallen by more than 3% in the last seven days. Moreover, in just the last 24 hours, its value dropped by over 1%.\n\nAt the time of writing, it was trading at $2,170.21 with a market capitalization of over $260 billion.\n\nThe price drop also stirred up bearish sentiment around the token, as shown by its plummeting Weighted Sentiment. Nonetheless, it remained a topic of discussion in the crypto space, which was evident from the high Social Volume.\n\nBut in a spot of good news, Mags, a popular crypto trader and analyst, recently shared a chart suggesting that ETH\u2019s price could break out in January 2024.\n\nAs per the tweet, ETH\u2019s price was testing a long-term support level, which historically has always been followed by price upticks.\n\nEvery time #Ethereum has tested the long-term trendline support, it has triggered a massive bull rally. Surprisingly, every re-test in the past has occurred in the month of January! If history repeats, we can expect a similar bounce in January 2024. pic.twitter.com/gnj0f0KpLQ \u2014 Mags (@thescalpingpro) December 17, 2023\n\nTo put it into perspective, when the ETH/BTC price touched that support level for the first time in 2017, their prices skyrocketed. A similar trend was also seen in years like 2020 and 2021.\n\nInvestors might bear losses in the short-term\n\nThough this looked good, things were not in Ethereum\u2019s favor in the short term. AMBCrypto\u2019s look at CryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that both US and Korean investors were not willing to buy ETH, reflecting bearish sentiment in the market.\n\nThe king of cryptos\u2019 MVRV ratio sank sharply over the last week, which is a typical bearish signal. Additionally, Futures investors continued to buy ETH, increasing the chances of a trend continuation.\n\nHowever, whale confidence in ETH remained high as its supply held by top addresses rose last week.\n\nAMBCrypto reported that in just the last week, whales scooped 100,000 ETH, which was worth more than $230 million at that time. Whales generally tend to accumulate coins at a lower price and sell them when they pump.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at ETH\u2019s daily chart revealed that ETH\u2019s price might sink further in the coming days.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum\u2019s MACD displayed a bearish crossover. Both its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) registered downticks, suggesting a further southward price movement.\n\nConsidering all the aforementioned metrics and datasets, investors must remain patient to enjoy profits from Ethereum."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as SEC Delays Hashdex and Grayscale Ethereum-Based ETFs \u2013 What\u2019s Going On?\n\nThe price of Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain and the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues its bounce from Monday\u2019s lows and was last trading in the $2,230s, up over 4.5% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe bounce comes despite the news that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed decisions on a number of Ether Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) applications, including one from Hashdex and Grayscale.\n\nInstead, Ether traders have been bidding the price higher in tandem with a broader crypto market rally that has seen Bitcoin (BTC) push back to the north of the $43,000 level.\n\nThe rally in the broader crypto space comes as macro traders continue to bet on interest rate cuts in the US and around the world next year, bets which are lifting the US equity prices and weighing on yields and the US dollar.\n\nThe S&P 500 was last trading at its highest levels since January 2022 at 4,750 and only just off record highs, while US 10-year yields were hovering close to multi-month lows around 3.90%.\n\nSEC Delays Hashdex and Grayscale Ethereum-based ETFs \u2013 What\u2019s Going On?\n\n\n\nAs per regulatory filings published by the SEC on their website, decisions on Hashdex\u2019s Nasdaq Ethereum ETF and on Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Futures ETF have been delayed until next May.\n\nUPDATE: SEC Going early with delay orders for @hashdex & @Grayscale #Ethereum ETF filings.

        "content": "Tue 19 Dec 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are facing an unprecedented storm. Transaction fees on these networks have reached stratospheric levels, propelling the industry into an era of exorbitant fees. This situation, triggered by the rise of EVM inscriptions and ordinals, is radically transforming the use and perception of the world\u2019s two leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe EVM Inscriptions Revolution: An Exorbitant Cost for Ethereum\n\nLast weekend, gas fees for EVM inscriptions exploded, reaching a record of 8 million dollars.\n\nThis surge, far from being an isolated phenomenon, reflects a growing trend on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nNetworks like Avalanche and Arbitrum One have also experienced a significant increase in gas fees. This highlights the growing demand for block space and the current limitations of these systems.\n\nThese figures are a clear indicator: innovation comes at a price, and it seems that Ethereum users are paying a hefty cost.\n\nBitcoin: A Goliath with Feet of Clay in the Face of Fees\n\nBitcoin, often seen as an unshakeable digital fortress, is also feeling the impact of this wave of high fees.\n\nAbout 280,000 Bitcoin transactions remain unconfirmed, and fees are climbing up to 37 dollars. In this context, using Bitcoin for peer-to-peer transactions poses a problem.\n\nThis situation with Ethereum and Bitcoin raises crucial questions about the long-term viability of digital currencies.\n\nFigures like Adam Back however, point out that this crisis could be a driver for the adoption of second-layer solutions, leading to necessary innovation in the ecosystem.\n\nImpact and Prospects: Between Innovation and Disruption\n\nEVM inscriptions and Bitcoin ordinals are greatly influencing fees. However, they represent a major advancement in the world of NFTs and blockchain.\n\nCollections such as Bitcoin Frogs Ordinals are experiencing a spectacular increase in their value and transaction volume. They now compete with established giants like CryptoPunks and BAYC.\n\nThis evolution demonstrates the crypto\u2019s ability to adapt and innovate, even in the face of significant challenges. However, it also highlights the need for a balance between innovation and accessibility, a major challenge for the future of Ethereum, Bitcoin, and the entire crypto space.\n\nThe current escalation of fees on Ethereum and Bitcoin could well be a turning point for these cryptocurrencies. While the challenges are real and pressing, they also open up opportunities for innovations and adaptations that could redefine the future of digital finance. In this seeming chaos, perhaps lies the dawn of a new era, where the balance between technological innovation and economic viability will finally be struck. Meanwhile, central banks are preparing for crypto raids.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Legendary market trader Peter Brandt has issued a very gloomy price target for Ethereum (ETH) as he sees the coin dropping to a low of $650.\n\nThe projection from Peter Brandt aligns with his known pessimism for Ethereum despite the digital currency currently ranked as the second-largest in the industry after Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $2,236.02, up by 4.37% in the past 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $268,605,808,266. With Peter Brandt\u2019s projection that Ethereum could fall to $1000 and, in the worst-case scenario, to $650, the coin will have to drop by 244% from its current price.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe legendary trader justified his assertion for this bearish call.\n\nPeter Brandt Shorted Ethereum\n\nPeter Brandt proclaimed that he \u201cshorted ETH\u201d on Friday to showcase confidence in his forecast. He believes that classical chart patterns tracking price action are not infallible as they always fail to perform by the books.\n\nThat being said, Brandt, pointing to the chart in his post, said if the rising wedge in Ethereum aligns with the script, then there are chances the coin will fall to the level he forecasted.\n\nClassical chart patterns in price charts are not sacred \u2013 they fail to perform according to the textbooks all the time But, if the rising wedge in Ethereum $ETH complies with the script, the target is $1,000, then $650 I shorted ETH on Friday \u2014 I have a protective B/E stop pic.twitter.com/76CciT3PE5 \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 18, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe presented chart shows a triangle with a wedge hypotenuse formed from around May 2022 to date. Ethereum has displayed two distinct high and low points within this period at $1,086.38 and $2,401.76 respectively. Interestingly, this low point has not been recorded in the past year, and the likelihood of a solo catastrophic fall below $1,000 is low considering the current sentiment in the market today.\n\nEthereum has thus far maintained a bullish outlook this year after printing an average growth rate of 87.01% in the Year-to-Date (YTD) period. However, as a prominent critic of Ethereum, Peter Brandt has refused to see this good side.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Utility Questioned\n\nAs part of his recent comment about Ethereum, Peter Brandt once questioned the protocol\u2019s utility and its longer-term prospects.\n\nAs reported earlier by The Crypto Basic, the legendary trader believes Ethereum may not be a listed asset in 10 years because it is not a comparable store of value like Bitcoin. Additionally, he noted that the high gas fee on Ethereum is further a significant drawback in its bid to maintain its attractiveness."

        "content": "Share:\n\nMarket picture\n\nThe crypto market has started the new week with a correction sentiment, reducing capitalisation by 3% to $1.54 trillion in the last 24 hours. As is often the case with intense moves, Bitcoin looks more stable than the market, losing only 1.8% to $41.1K. Ethereum is down 2.3% to $2160.\n\nBitcoin is once again testing the local support it managed to hold last week. But we are attracted by a sequence of lower local highs, indicating an impressive selling proposition. We may be seeing profit taking from all the upside from the October lows. Working off this scenario suggests a pullback to the $38K area if the market falls below $40K. But even this potentially nasty drawdown looks to be just part of a larger bull cycle that Bitcoin is now moving within.\n\nEthereum is developing a retreat from the upper boundary of the trading channel, currently testing the early April peak area. The scenario of a shallow correction suggests a decline of about $100 more to $2060, but we should be ready for $1700 as well.\n\nNews background\n\nMorgan Creek Digital founder Anthony Pompliano believes that BTC continues to follow four-year market cycles fitting between halvings, and the next growth phase of the first cryptocurrency is now beginning.\n\nThe bitcoin-based NFT market will grow 100-fold in 2024, researchers at cryptocurrency exchange Bitget predict. The ORDI token, being the leading token of the Bitcoin ecosystem, is already capable of entering the top 30 in terms of market capitalisation during the next bull market. If the BTC ecosystem continues to expand, Bitcoin could reach $100K thanks to a surge in demand for the first cryptocurrency.\n\nThe US SEC is reviewing its approach to spot bitcoin ETFs following \u2018court decisions\u2019, the regulator\u2019s head, Gary Gensler, commented. The agency is currently reviewing between eight and 12 such proposals, he said.\n\nThe SEC rejected a petition by exchange Coinbase to develop rules for the cryptocurrency industry. According to Gary Gensler, existing laws apply to the industry, and there is nothing that would indicate the need for new regulations.\n\nAsset management companies Galaxy Digital and DWS Group, as well as Dutch market maker Flow Traders, are creating a subsidiary firm, AllUnity, which will issue a euro-denominated stablecoin.\n\nOne more Solana-based meme token, also featuring a dog, Bonk (BONK), rose 100% overnight after listing on Coinbase. Its capitalisation has already passed the $1.7 billion mark."

        "content": "Value of Stablecoins on Ethereum Sees 34% Decline, Tron Records 57.7% Growth since 2022\n\nThe value of stablecoins on Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a decline of 34% since 2022, while stablecoins on TRON (TRX) have seen a significant growth rate of 57.7% during the same period.\n\nAccording to a recent report from Sixdegree Lab, the supply of stablecoins on Ethereum has been steadily decreasing, dropping from its peak of $100 billion to $66 billion, marking a 34% decline.\n\nIn contrast, stablecoin supply on Tron has followed an upward trajectory, growing from $31 billion in 2022 to $48.9 billion. This impressive increase of 57.7% aligns with the overall market price trend.\n\nDespite the recent bull market, the overall value of stablecoins has not seen a significant increase.\n\nCurrently, the total market value of stablecoins stands at $129.5 billion, which represents a decline of 31% compared to its peak value of $188 billion.\n\nAmong the stablecoins, Tether ( USDT) holds the largest market share at 56.3%, followed by USD Coin ( USDC) at 30.5%, and DAI at 5.07%.\n\nThese three stablecoins have a combined value of $40.03 billion, $21.7 billion, and $3.6 billion, respectively.\n\nMajor Stablecoin Holders\n\n\n\nExternally owned accounts (EOAs) hold approximately 50% of stablecoins, while centralized exchanges (CEXes) account for around 30%.\n\nDeFi protocols, on the other hand, only hold approximately 5.5% of stablecoins, a significant decrease from its peak of around 25% in January 2022.\n\nThe decrease in stablecoin supply within DeFi protocols on Ethereum may be attributed to the emergence of Ethereum Layer2 solutions.\n\nThese Layer2 solutions have provided a more favorable environment for the development of DeFi and innovative protocols.\n\nAddressing the holders of stablecoins on Ethereum, the majority (94.2%) hold less than $1,000 worth of stablecoins, contributing only 9.28% to the overall stablecoin holdings.\n\nIn contrast, addresses holding over 100,000 stablecoins represent around 0.562% of addresses but contribute a substantial 87.6% to the total stablecoin holdings.\n\nInterestingly, approximately 60% of the stablecoins held by these top addresses remain dormant.\n\nThese addresses are either considered reserve addresses, with a stablecoin expenditure to income ratio below 0.2, or inactive addresses that have not engaged in any stablecoin transactions within the past 180 days.\n\nStablecoins See Positive Supply Growth\n\n\n\nBack in November, the 90-day net change in the supply of the top four stablecoins, USDT, USDC, Binance USD (BUSD), and Dai (DAI), turned noticeably positive, marking the first such instance since the collapse of Terra in mid-May 2022.\n\nStablecoins have been widely used to fund cryptocurrency purchases since 2020.\n\nAn increase in their supply is seen as a potential buying pressure or a reserve of funds that investors can deploy to purchase cryptocurrencies or use as a margin in derivatives trading.\n\nStablecoins remain key to the day-to-day operations of the cryptocurrency industry, acting as a bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cStablecoins have become the foundation of the cryptocurrency market,\u201d William Quigley, one of the co-founders of Tether, told Cryptonews.\n\n\u201cStablecoins are the core ingredient in virtually all DeFi applications. Without stablecoins, overall trading volume and liquidity in the crypto market would likely drop 75%.\u201d"

        "content": "Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst James Seyffart argues that the SEC has, through its actions, conceded that Ethereum is not a security.\n\nThe status of Ethereum\u2019s native asset, ETH, under U.S. laws, has been debated over the years. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sued several crypto projects for issuing tokens that were allegedly securities.\n\nYet, the regulatory agency has not sued the Ethereum Foundation or publicly alleged that ETH is a security.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe agency\u2019s silence on Ethereum and recent actions about the asset point to it viewing ETH in a different light, according to James Seyffart. The experienced analyst, who has discussed the potential launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., believes that the SEC does not view ETH as a security.\n\nIn a recent interview, he said, \u201cMy view is that the SEC has pretty much implicitly accepted Ethereum as a commodity at this point. They also now have approved Ethereum futures ETFs, which are squarely in their purview.\u201d\n\nAccording to James Seyffart, the SEC going back to calling ETH a security would mean delisting all Ethereum futures they have already consented to launch.\n\nAt the same time, such a scenario would mean that the SEC would be fighting against not only the crypto industry but also, ultimately, its sister agency, the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees futures contracts.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSEC and Gary Gensler have picked Bitcoin and Ethereum as Non-Securities\n\nThe Bloomberg ETF analyst continued by saying that the SEC and its Chair Gary Gensler have already handpicked Bitcoin and Ethereum as being commodities instead of securities.\n\nHe predicts that sometime in 2024, SEC Chair Gensler will publicly call Bitcoin a commodity and then remain silent on Ethereum\u2019s status, evidently confirming that it is not a security.\n\nIs the SEC backing down on Ethereum? ? Bloomberg\u2019s @JSeyff spills on @unchained_pod: With Ethereum futures ETFs already approved, the SEC might be subtly pivoting to conceding that Ethereum is a commodity. ? ? Listen now: https://t.co/lD20tIkl6Z pic.twitter.com/z5npQg2uEM \u2014 Laura Shin (@laurashin) December 16, 2023\n\nJames Seyffart believes that waging a war against Ethereum to declare it a security is not just worth the SEC\u2019s energy at this point in the project\u2019s history. Hence, Gensler would give it a pass and then call \u201cpretty much anything else under the sun a security.\u201d\n\nAn asset labeled a security would subject the founding entity to registrations, regular financial reporting and disclosures with the SEC. On the other hand, as a commodity, such burdens are not required by the SEC, as the asset is outside its purview.\n\nSEC Chair Gensler has repeatedly suggested that most crypto projects that issue tokens should be deemed securities and come under the agency\u2019s purview.\n\nYet, the crypto industry has vehemently defended its position with ongoing lawsuits against Ripple and Coinbase, all connected to the status of crypto assets as securities or commodities."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nYou get an airdrop! You get an airdrop!\n\nAmid hopes and prayers for the crypto bull market\u2019s imminent return, the onslaught of \u201cfree money\u201d airdrops for crypto users continues. The latest comes courtesy of Frame, an Ethereum scaling network designed for NFTs.\n\nThe project announced Tuesday that it will soon launch a native FRAME token, and that any crypto user who has transacted an NFT on Ethereum in the last two years is now eligible to collect varying amounts of FRAME. Criteria used to determine a user\u2019s airdrop size is determined based on the number of NFT trades made, the financial volume of those trades, and the amount of creator royalties paid during those transactions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile NFT traders can already claim FRAME via an online portal, those tokens won\u2019t functionally exist until January 31, when they will go live alongside the Frame mainnet.\n\n$FRAME, for the immediate future, will be used for governance on the network. This is especially important when you consider the value that the Frame Creator Fund will come to hold. The token will be transfer-locked until a later chapter. pic.twitter.com/4nZggIKqg3 \u2014 Frame (@frame_xyz) December 19, 2023\n\nFRAME tokens will initially be used exclusively for governance of the Frame ecosystem, the project announced, and to control the Frame Creator Fund. At a later, as-yet-unannounced date, the tokens will be unlocked for transfer and presumably become tradable on secondary markets for monetary value.\n\nUsers already began claiming their free FRAME Tuesday. Some reported receiving thousands of tokens, based on their NFT trading activity.\n\nI survived the bear market and claimed my $FRAME tokens!@frame_xyz is the Layer 2 for creators and collectors. If you've traded NFTs on Ethereum and paid royalties in the past two years you're eligible! \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\ud83c\udf84 You can check here \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/95XO3A357v pic.twitter.com/lISxo38lmn \u2014 Pranksy \ud83d\udce6 (@pranksy) December 19, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday\u2019s airdrop is only the first of many FRAME giveaways, the project said. Once the project fully launches at the end of next month, it will begin distributing more tokens to users and community members to encourage activity.\n\nFrame seeks to create an ecosystem for the buying, selling, and creation of NFTs that unambiguously puts creators first. The layer-2 rollup is based on Arbitrum Nova, an Ethereum scaling network.\n\nSince last year, the practice of enforcing creator royalties\u2014fees generally between 2.5% and 10% levied on NFT buyers, meant to support artists and enshrine blockchain\u2019s democratized ethos\u2014has been steadily dismantled under the weight of brutal market forces.\n\nFrame enforces creator fees at the network level; it says it also prioritizes NFT security more than other blockchains, and will eventually be run by community members.\n\nIn tandem with its airdrop announcement, Frame also announced that it has secured an initial fundraise led by Electric Capital, with participation from several crypto industry founders and influencers, including Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz. A Frame advisor told Decrypt that the project isn\u2019t yet disclosing the funding amount or total amount of FRAME tokens.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe debate around Ethereum\u2019s classification under U.S. securities laws has lingered for years. Notably, the SEC has taken legal action against various crypto projects for issuing tokens allegedly classified as securities. However, Ethereum and its native asset, ETH, have remained notably untouched by the regulatory agency.\n\nSEC\u2019s Implicit View on Ethereum\n\nBloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst, James Seyffart, contends that the SEC\u2019s actions\u2014or lack thereof\u2014indicate a divergence in how it views ETH. In his analysis, Seyffart suggests that the SEC implicitly acknowledges Ethereum as a commodity rather than a security. He points to the approval of Ethereum futures ETFs as a sign within the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction favoring this view.\n\nIs the SEC backing down on Ethereum? \ud83e\udd14\n\n\n\nBloomberg\u2019s @JSeyff spills on @unchained_pod: With Ethereum futures ETFs already approved, the SEC might be subtly pivoting to conceding that Ethereum is a commodity. \ud83d\udca5\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Listen now: https://t.co/lD20tIkl6Z pic.twitter.com/z5npQg2uEM \u2014 Laura Shin (@laurashin) December 16, 2023\n\nHe further predicts that any reversal by the SEC on Ethereum\u2019s status would result in the delisting of approved Ethereum futures contracts. Such a move would not only challenge the crypto industry but also pit the SEC against its sister agency, the CFTC, which oversees futures contracts.\n\nIt is worth noting that SEC Chair Gary Gensler has implicitly categorized both Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities rather than securities. But Seyffart forecasts Gensler to publicly label Bitcoin as a commodity in 2024 while remaining silent on Ethereum\u2019s status, further cementing its position as a non-security asset.\n\nSeyffart believes that declaring Ethereum security isn\u2019t a priority for the SEC at this juncture, suggesting that Gensler might opt to label other crypto assets as securities instead. This classification carries significant regulatory implications, as securities necessitate stringent registrations and financial disclosures with the SEC, unlike commodities that fall outside its regulatory scope.\n\nGensler\u2019s Position and Industry Reactions\n\nDespite Gensler\u2019s stance advocating for most crypto projects issuing tokens to be considered securities under SEC jurisdiction, the crypto industry is actively challenging this narrative. Ongoing lawsuits involving Ripple and Coinbase highlight the industry\u2019s vigorous defense of its position on crypto assets\u2019 classification as securities or commodities."

        "content": "Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have started Dec. 18 in the red, down 2.53% and 3.67%, respectively. However, the newly launched Bitcoin Minetrix is outpacing other cryptos as its presale surges past $5.4 million.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum dip at local tops amid extreme transaction fees\n\nBitcoin Ordinals took center stage recently, with the prices of related projects climbing astronomically. Meanwhile, ordinal-related activity on the Bitcoin Network has also been soaring, causing Bitcoin transaction fees to spike to an average of $37, according to BitInfoCharts.\n\nThere have only been two times in history when Bitcoin fees have been higher, at the 2021 and 2018 bull run peaks.\n\nBitcoin average transaction fee | Source: BitInfoCharts\n\nConsequently, data from Mempool.space shows that this has led to over 290,000 unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions yet to be processed.\n\nThis has negatively affected investor sentiment, sparking concerns about how unusable Bitcoin may become as the bull run advances.\n\nAccording to X analyst WhaleWire, spikes in transaction fees often coincide with a market top.\n\n\u201cHistorically, during market peaks, #Bitcoin experiences a surge in transaction fees and network congestion. The media, as always, is not talking about this, but fees are now at dangerously high levels (2nd highest level in history). This signals immense pressure on the network.\u201d X analyst WhaleWire\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has since dropped below a crucial trend line support, according to analyst Crypto Rover.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, the analyst warns that $800 million of Bitcoin longs will be liquidated should BTC hit $40,600. If this occurs, these positions would be forcibly closed by opening opposing sell positions, causing Bitcoin\u2019s price to retrace much deeper.\n\nIf #Bitcoin hits $40,600\n\n\n\nMore than $800,000,000 in Longs will be liquidated\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mk4t8bWBji \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) December 18, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, data from YCharts shows Ethereum has also faced its own transaction fee battle, reaching its highest rates in six months on Friday.\n\nYet, simultaneously, Bitcoin and Solana have begun capturing Ethereum\u2019s NFT trading volume, with Bitcoin significantly outpacing it in recent days.\n\nAt the same time, chains like Cardano, Avalanche, Solana, and Injective Protocol are all gathering momentum. This combination of high fees and market share being lost on multiple fronts is likely damaging Ethereum\u2019s market sentiment, evident in its decreasing price and trading volume, as seen on the price chart below.\n\nEthereum price chart | Source: TradingView\n\nThat said, the market continues to present lucrative opportunities, with one of the most promising new cryptos being Bitcoin Minetrix, a compelling stake-to-mine protocol currently undergoing a presale.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix presale surges past $5.4m as analyst predicts 100X\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is a new cryptocurrency that enables anyone to mine Bitcoin effortlessly and securely.\n\nIt is based on a cloud mining system, where users stake $BTCMTX tokens for Bitcoin mining credits. These are non-transferable ERC-20 tokens that they can burn for cloud mining power.\n\nThis mean users can get started free of technical expertise, upfront costs, and overhead costs. Moreover, it also provides an invaluable iteration to previous cloud mining protocols.\n\nIn the past, cloud mining has been criticized for scams and inefficiencies, where operators ask users for extra cash or do not pay out their Bitcoin rewards. However, the decentralized and immutable nature of $BTCMTX eradicates this risk, ensuring the dapp\u2019s security.\n\nBlockchain auditing firm Coinsult also conducted a smart contract audit that found Bitcoin Minetrix safe and secure.\n\nIts compelling use case, crossed with robust security and the vast utility of $BTCMTX, has led to exciting price predictions from analysts. One of the most promising comes from renowned YouTuber Jacob Bury, who speculates it could rise 100x after its IEO.\n\nSo far, the Bitcoin Minetrix presale has raised over $5.4 million, indicating immense community interest. Investors can buy $BTCMTX for $0.123 but must hurry as the price will rise in three days.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

Additionally, concerns emerged from the Empire State Manufacturing numbers, hinting at growing unease about the possibility of an impending recession.\n\nHowever, as the year-end approaches, Wall Street remains focused on seeking returns, which could translate into continued interest in cryptocurrencies as an investment option, to \u201cchase performance.\u201d\n\nSupport Below\n\nA significant support level lies at $2,100, which was previously a substantial resistance level. This level continues to attract buyers who see Ethereum as a valuable asset, especially with the year-end boost in the crypto market in mind.\n\nOn the upside, the $2,350 level may act as a barrier, causing some hesitation in Ethereum's ascent. Should this level be breached, the $2,500 mark becomes the next target. This would be the bullish scenario that I think a lot of people are counting on.\n\nIn the current market environment, there is little rationale to consider selling Ethereum. Profit-taking is a natural occurrence and may be expected in the vicinity of current prices. The prudent approach is to consider a \"buy on the dip\" strategy, but with a measure of caution not to become overly aggressive. The market's direction is clear, and Ethereum appears poised for further gains.\n\nConsequently, selling Ethereum does not appear to be a favorable option at this juncture. Instead, traders may want to keep a watchful eye on the $2,100 support level, viewing any potential dip as an opportunity. Whether Ethereum experiences a drop or continues its ascent, there are prospects for traders who remain attentive and exercise caution in their approach.\n\nAt the end of the day, Ethereum's market landscape is characterized by volatility and sensitivity to economic indicators. Interest rates and economic concerns are currently driving market sentiment. While profit-taking is anticipated, the overall trend remains bullish, favoring a \"buy on the dip\" strategy. Ethereum's path toward the $2,500 level seems plausible, and traders should remain vigilant for potential opportunities, particularly around the $2,100 support level.\n\nReady to trade our Ethereum forecast?

A three-day candlestick close above the mean threshold (midline) of this order block would confirm the continuation of the uptrend. Such a move would constitute a 10% move north above current levels.\n\nIncreased buying pressure, enough to flip the supply zone into a bullish breaker above the $48,000 level, would set the tone for Bitcoin price to test the $50,000 psychological level.

Should this sustain, Ethereum price could soon fall back into the cover of the ascending parallel channel, within which the uptrend would be restored.\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, enhanced seller momentum could see Ethereum price extend the fall, testing the mid-April supply zone that now acts as a bullish breaker.

        "title": "Ex-Ethereum developer claims 70% of ETH was pre-mined - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Lane Rettig, a former core developer for Ethereum, has recently raised serious allegations about the distribution of Ethereum\u2018s native cryptocurrency, ETH. In a statement that garnered significant attention from the crypto community, Rettig claimed that approximately 70% of all ETH was distributed during the project\u2019s pre-mine phase. This figure has decreased to about 60% in recent times. This revelation has raised questions about the transparency and fairness of Ethereum\u2019s Initial Coin Offering (ICO).\n\nRettig\u2019s comments were made in a video that has been widely circulated among cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts. He expressed uncertainty about the precise percentage of pre-mined ETH, suggesting a range that could be anywhere from 10% to 80%. However, he emphasized that the proportion was excessively high regardless of the specific number. Rettig\u2019s statement highlights a long-standing concern in the crypto industry about the concentration of ownership in the hands of a few individuals or entities.\n\nQuestions surrounding ETH\u2019s ICO transparency\n\nThe controversy surrounding Ethereum\u2019s ICO is not new. In the past, there have been discussions and rumours about the lack of transparency in the distribution of ETH during its early stages. Rettig\u2019s allegations add fuel to these ongoing debates. He mentioned rumours, although anecdotal, about a very small number of individuals purchasing significant portions of pre-mined ETH pseudonymously. This raises concerns about the potential for centralization and manipulation within the Ethereum network.\n\nMoreover, a video from last year resurfaced, showing ETH co-founder Joseph Lubin advising early Ethereum investors to use multiple pseudonymous identities during the ETH ICO. This strategy reportedly aimed to avoid deterring public participation by revealing the concentration of holdings among a few investors. This revelation further casts doubt on the transparency of ETH\u2019s early distribution process.\n\nEthereum\u2019s reputation challenged by ICO allegations\n\nRettig\u2019s involvement with the Ethereum Foundation lasted approximately one and a half years. He cited the issues he perceived with the ETH pre-mine as a primary reason for his departure. According to Rettig, his role had diverged significantly from his initial expectations, leading him to feel that he was inadvertently supporting the interests of specific individuals, namely Joseph Lubin.\n\nThese allegations are not isolated incidents. Steven Nerayoff, a former ETH advisor, has previously accused Ethereum\u2019s leadership, including co-founders Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin, of engaging in fraudulent activities during the ICO. Nerayoff compared the alleged misconduct at ETH with the infamous FTX fraud, claiming it to be significantly more severe.\n\nThe recent allegations by Rettig have reignited concerns about the centralization of power and wealth within the Ethereum ecosystem. The crypto community is now more vocal in demanding transparency and fair practices from Ethereum and all major blockchain projects. These developments could have a lasting impact on ETH\u2019s reputation and the broader perception of ICOs in the cryptocurrency industry."

        "title": "If You Missed Out On Ethereum (ETH) Mania, Low-Cap DeFi Darlings Injective (INJ), Arbitrum (ARB), And Pullix (PLX) Aren\u2019t Too Late! - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Ethereum, the most valuable altcoin by market capitalization, reached an all-time high of $4,891.70 in November 2021. While some investors profited from the demonstration, the great majority did not. Fortunately, there are low-cap DeFi tokens such as Injective, Arbitrum, and Pullix with great growth potential.\n\nIs it Too Late To Invest in Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum (ETH) is the second largest asset in the crypto space. It has a market cap of $277 billion. As of 2021, the token peaked at $4,891 amid the market rally. Those who joined the rally saw massive gains.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum price movement in the past few years has been disappointing. Fortunately, the token gained momentum in the H2 of 2023 and rallied past the $2,000 mark.\n\nEthereum is trading between $2,161.29 and $2,384.93 in the second week of December. There is a chance that an Ethereum ETF will launch soon. If this happens, the Ethereum price could surpass its 2021 peak to new highs.\n\nInjective (INJ) Soars 2,360%\n\nSince January, Injective (INJ) has been on a major bull run. As the Injective coin rose, it broke through two important resistance levels, one diagonal and one horizontal. In October, the rate of this rising trend accelerated. This was the point at which the Injective coin surpassed the horizontal resistance zone.\n\nThe Injective price reached a new all-time high of $32.20 in December. This marks a massive increase of 2,360% since the beginning of 2023. Also, the Injective market cap has risen to $2.7 billion, making it the 31st largest coin.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) Regains Bullish Momentum\n\nArbitrum (ARB) is another low-cap defi darling with bullish prospects. Early this year, the token rose to an all-time high of $11.80 in March due to high network activity. One reason for the rise was the Arbitrum coin airdrop. However, the sell-off that followed pushed the token below $1.\n\nSurprisingly, Arbitrum is back in the crypto race and has risen above the $1 mark. With the next market bull approaching, the Arbitrum coin can increase to its previous highs.\n\nThe Pullix (PLX), the Best Cryptocurrency for Ethereum-Like Growth\n\nPullix (PLX) is the world\u2019s first community-backed exchange and Trade-to-Earn token. It allows users to trade various assets, including cryptocurrencies, from one platform. One attractive feature of the platform is the DeFi swap. This swap simplifies token trading with minimal fees.\n\nWithin Pullix Swap, orders and trades are fast as the platform uses an automated market maker model (AMM). In this model, trading happens against a liquidity pool. This removes the need for a direct match with another user on an order book. As a result, users can swap their tokens fast and at low fees.\n\nPullix has taken steps to stabilize its native token. Firstly, a portion of the exchange earnings (10%-30%) will be used to support the $PLX token. The fixed supply of $PLX tokens also helps to check against unchecked inflation.\n\nThe exchange has also scheduled periodic token burns to reduce PLX circulating supply. The aim is to increase scarcity and enhance the token\u2019s value over time. As a result, Pullix\u2019s native token, PLX, is among the best cryptocurrency investments to consider in the market. The token is currently in the first phase of its presale and is priced at only $0.04.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne major advantage of low market cap DeFi tokens is their high chance of massive growth. The situation is even better for projects like Pullix at the presale stage. While Injective and Arbitrum have had their bull run, Pullix is a new leaf. Mirroring Ethereum\u2019s price rally will take its price to a high level. The next market rally will be its first bull run. As a result, there are high chances for a meteoric rally.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\n."

For example, the daily trading volumes of ETH on centralized exchanges exceed 8 billion dollars, while those of SOL are less than 2 billion.\n\nFurthermore, it should be noted that the data related to DEX does not only concern the exchange of ETH and SOL cryptocurrencies, but also all the other tokens present on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.\n\nIn particular, the recent boom in trading on Solana\u2019s DEX is mainly due to the boom of the Bonk token.\n\nThe incredible hype about Bonk\n\nTaking into consideration the overall trading volumes of Bonk on both DEX and decentralized exchanges, the all-time peak occurred precisely between December 15th and 16th.\n\nBonk is a token on Solana launched in December of last year, and had never exceeded $200 million in daily trading volume until December 8th.\n\nActually, to tell the truth, if we exclude the initial weeks, afterwards it didn\u2019t even exceed 10 million until the end of October.\n\nStarting from the end of October, with the awakening of the crypto markets, both trading volumes and price have skyrocketed.\n\nOn December 13th, volumes had risen to $350 million, and the following day they had already skyrocketed to $680 million.\n\nThe peak on December 15/16 first saw a surpass of 3 billion dollars, and then a decline to 2.6 billion. These numbers alone are able to justify the surpass of daily trading volume on the Solana DEX compared to the Ethereum DEX.\n\nThe return to normality\n\nIn fact, yesterday the trading volume of Bonk tokens dropped to 1.1 billion dollars, and the daily trading volume on DEXs on Ethereum has returned higher than that on Solana.\n\nSince Bonk is a token that \u201cawakens\u201d before Christmas, this trend is destined to quickly fade away, and yesterday\u2019s decline seems likely to persist today.\n\nTherefore, it was an exceptional circumstance not specifically related to Solana but to a token issued on the Solana blockchain, and therefore exchangeable on Solana DEXs and not on Ethereum ones.\n\nFor example, considering other parameters such as TVL, Ethereum continues to dominate undisputedly, with 55% of the entire DeFi TVL DeFi.\n\nAlthough it is slightly down compared to the 56% at the beginning of the month, it is still more than the sum of the TVL of all the other chains put together.\n\nIn addition, Solana is not even on the podium from this point of view, because compared to 28 billion dollars of TVL on Ethereum, 8 billion on Tron, and 3 billion on BCS, Solana is only in fifth place with just over one billion.\n\nThe same market capitalization of Bonk is just over one billion dollars, and this indicates that there are not many BONK tokens locked on DEX.\n\nSolana is challenging Ethereum\n\nDespite this, it can still be said that SOlana is somehow challenging Ethereum.\n\nWhile Ethereum in general seems untouchable at the moment, there are niches where Solana or other chains can perform better.\n\nIn particular, they perform better where it is more important for fees to be contained. For example, on DEXs it can be a problem if the average transaction fees are around $10, as is the case with current transactions on Ethereum.\n\nSolana allows for faster transactions and significantly lower costs, so it\u2019s no wonder that tokens like Bonk, which are not appealing to large investors, are now being issued on blockchains like Solana and traded there, perhaps on DEX platforms.\n\nMoreover, Bonk has only recently been added to the main centralized exchanges, while until just a few days ago it could practically only be traded on DEX.\n\nNote that the trading volume of Bonk in the last 24 hours on all exchanges has dropped below 700 million dollars, so the phenomenon mentioned above seems to have run its course."

        "content": "Veteran commodity and forex trader Peter Brandt recently revealed a super bearish outlook on Ethereum (ETH). To drive a point, he even shorted the hell out of the cryptocurrency he referred to as a \u201cpiece of junk\u201d to $650.\n\nPreviously, Reaper Financial Founder and CEO Patrick Riley tore through Ethereum, telling people that it\u2019s a \u201cdying horse that\u2019s been limping along for a long time.\u201d He believes XRP will stand to benefit from its eventual downfall.\n\nPeter Brandt happened to echo the sentiment in a short post to his 707.7K followers on the X platform. The veteran investor started the scathing remark by telling people that ETH is not comparable to Bitcoin (BTC) as a store of value. Then, he said the functionality and gas price of Ethereum makes it \u201ca piece of junk.\u201d\n\nAdding insult to injury, Brandt capped off his statement with his prediction that ETH will no longer be a listed asset after a decade.\n\nEther $ETH is not comparable to $BTC as a store of value. Why hodl ETH when you can hodl BTC\n\nAnd the functionality and gas price of ETH make the crypto a piece of junk\n\nMy prediction is that ETH may not even be a listed asset in 10 years https://t.co/4WQ7wnFWEO \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 14, 2023\n\nLast Friday, the investor went on to short ETH looking at the targets of $1,000 to $650.\n\nClassical chart patterns in price charts are not sacred \u2013 they fail to perform according to the textbooks all the time\n\n\n\nBut, if the rising wedge in Ethereum $ETH complies with the script, the target is $1,000, then $650\n\n\n\nI shorted ETH on Friday \u2014 I have a protective B/E stop pic.twitter.com/76CciT3PE5 \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 18, 2023\n\nEthereum Today\n\nIn light of these negative comments, Ethereum is moving in tandem with Bitcoin on the upside as of 5:30 AM UTC. It gained 3.5% in the 24-hour frame to $2,242 while trading volume soared to 29.42% as $10.45 billion worth of ETH moved in crypto exchanges. During this period, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap pivoted between a low of $2,120 and $2,249.\n\nEthereum is 0.78% up in the weekly charts but has shown double-digit gains in the monthly and annual charts at 14.33% and 89.88%, respectively. It\u2019s still 54% down from its all-time high at 4,891 in November 2021 but optimism runs that it might narrow the gap next year.\n\nStrengths of Ethereum\n\nThe primary strength of the Ethereum blockchain lies in the solid support of the crypto community to its ecosystem. The platform is preferred by developers because of its flexibility in smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nThe continuous push to improve its economy is also another selling point of Ethereum. A notable development was its shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake (PoS) in 2022. Its co-founder Vitalik Buterin is currently working on a redesign for the network to enhance its performance and staking features, too.\n\nLastly, due to its strong correlation with Bitcoin, Ethereum is expected to rally with it by next year upon the fulfillment of two major events that are expected to launch BTC prices to the roof, namely the approval of pending spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETF) in the US and the halving."
