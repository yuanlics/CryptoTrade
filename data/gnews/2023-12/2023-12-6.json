        "title": "What Is Ethereum (ETH)? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum is a blockchain supported by a decentralized network of computers all over the world. Established in 2015, Ethereum introduced the idea of smart contracts, which are bits of code written into the blockchain that can support various types of applications or even new cryptocurrencies. The native token of Ethereum is ether (ETH 0.92%), which is used to pay for certain activities on the network. Read on to learn what Ethereum is, what you can do with the Ethereum technology, whether ether is a good investment, and the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC 1.39%).\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat is Ethereum? What is Ethereum? The basic idea of Ethereum is that it\u2019s a platform that can execute and verify application code without the need for a central authority. It does this through an implementation of blockchain technology run across a decentralized network. Blockchain is a concept used to secure data on a network. Basically, it ensures nobody changes the data on the network without authorization from the majority of people using it. A decentralized network means there\u2019s no single point of authority, like a corporation or government, that can make changes to the data on the network. Ethereum uses a proof-of-stake model to secure the blockchain. Network members must stake Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ether, to verify blocks written to the Ethereum blockchain. Ether is also used to pay for work done on the blockchain. Some merchants and service providers will accept ether as payment.\n\nWhat can it do? What can Ethereum do? Ethereum and the concepts pioneered in its development form the backbone of many advancements in blockchain technology. Using smart contracts, which are bits of code written to the blockchain, has allowed people to build all sorts of applications, including: Stablecoins. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that maintains its value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. There are several mechanisms you can use to maintain that value that smart contracts can enforce.\n\nA stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that maintains its value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. There are several mechanisms you can use to maintain that value that smart contracts can enforce. Lending applications. You can write a smart contract that enforces the terms of a loan -- interest rate, term, how the loan is paid back, etc. This can make it easier for people to get a loan and for individuals to loan money directly and collect more interest.\n\nYou can write a smart contract that enforces the terms of a loan -- interest rate, term, how the loan is paid back, etc. This can make it easier for people to get a loan and for individuals to loan money directly and collect more interest.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs). You can create a unique token that can\u2019t be replicated, called a non-fungible token, or NFT. The token can represent anything from a piece of art or a deed to a house. There are dozens of other ways to apply smart contracts and blockchain technology. Is it a good investment? Is Ethereum a good investment? If you\u2019re interested in investing in cryptocurrencies, Ethereum\u2019s native currency, ether, is a good choice. Ethereum is the clear market leader in blockchain applications. Most new developments in decentralized finance or other uses for blockchain are built on the Ethereum network. That inherently gives ether value since it\u2019s needed to keep the network running and verifying the blockchain as well as paying for transactions on the blockchain. The shift to a proof-of-stake system from a proof-of-work system makes it more sustainable from an energy-use perspective. That opens the door for it to make advancements in processing speed, which can make smart contracts more broadly applicable. Ethereum has strong staying power (in the crypto world), so it\u2019s much more unlikely to provide the boom-or-bust results of other smaller currencies.\n\nRelated investing topics\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Ether and Bitcoin are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The currencies have a lot in common, but Ethereum builds on the underlying blockchain technology pioneered by Bitcoin\u2019s creator. The idea behind Bitcoin was to create a permissionless, decentralized digital currency. Its creator wanted a way to make payments that weren\u2019t backed by a central government or agency. As a result, Bitcoin is used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Ethereum had a much broader idea. The blockchain is used for all sorts of decentralized applications. While ether is used to pay for transactions on the blockchain, you can also have other cryptocurrencies built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum and Bitcoin also use different protocols to secure their blockchains. Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system. Under this system, every computer on the network is working to solve a complex math problem to write the next block to the blockchain. Once a computer solves the problem, the other members of the network verify the solution (which takes much less work), and a new block attaches to the chain. Ethereum used the same system until September 2022. It now uses a proof-of-stake system that requires network members to hold ether to validate the next block in the blockchain. Validators are financially incentivized to verify correct data because they risk losing their stake if they\u2019re a bad actor. Transaction speeds are usually faster on the Ethereum network. Transaction costs can vary more widely on Ethereum based on how many people are actively trying to write new data to the blockchain, i.e., transaction volume. Both have their use cases where they excel, and either ether or Bitcoin could be a viable investment choice for someone interested in buying and holding crypto."

        "content": "A whale deposited over 39,000 ETH to the Kraken exchange.\n\nThis marked Ethereum\u2019s first positive flow in a month.\n\nAfter experiencing several days of continuous outflows, Ethereum [ETH] has just observed its first significant influx of the month.\n\nThe increase in the volume of inflow into exchanges could be attributed to a recent transaction made by a prominent whale.\n\nEthereum whale shakes up exchange flow\n\nOn the 5th of December, an Ethereum whale that had remained inactive for five years initiated a significant transaction. The whale transferred its entire holdings to the Kraken exchange.\n\nRecords from Lookonchain showed that this whale had acquired 47,260 ETH at an average price of $240 per token between June and August 2017.\n\nAfter selling a portion of its holdings previously, the whale has now deposited the remaining 39,260 ETH tokens onto the exchange.\n\nAt the press time market rate, these tokens amount to around $87.5 million. The anticipated total earnings for the whale from selling all the tokens are expected to reach around $78 million.\n\nThis recent move has caused a notable disruption in the Ethereum exchange flow.\n\nEthereum inflow rises for the first time in the month\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s examination of the Ethereum Exchange Netflow on CryptoQuant showed a consistent negative trend over the past few days. The trend signaled a prevalence of outflows from exchanges.\n\nHowever, there has been a noteworthy reversal in this pattern within the last 24 hours. AMBCrypto observed that the net flow turned positive at the close of trading on the 4th of December, registering an influx of over 15,800 ETH.\n\nAlso, as of press time, this positive momentum has intensified, showcasing the impact of the recent whale movement. The inflow has surged to over 39,400 ETH and could increase further by the day\u2019s end.\n\nThis shift suggested not only the influence of the recent whale transaction but also an overall increase in the amount of the token being deposited into exchanges.\n\nETH remains above $2,000\n\nEthereum has exhibited a positive trend for five consecutive days, propelling its price significantly beyond the $2,000 mark. However, at the time of this update, it had experienced a minor setback, with a decline of around 1.5%.\n\nNevertheless, it has managed to sustain its upward trajectory, remaining above the $2,200 price level.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nAdditionally, on the 4th of December, Ethereum recorded a substantial trading volume of over 16 billion. This marked the highest volume in the past few weeks.\n\nAs of press time, the trading volume had slightly decreased to around 14 billion."

The SEC needs more time to assess a proposed rule change that would allow NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.\n\nThe SEC has allocated a longer period to evaluate the proposed rule change and has set January 25, 2024, as the deadline for its decision or the initiation of proceedings to determine its disapproval. The SEC emphasized the importance of having sufficient time to thoroughly consider the proposal and the concerns raised.\n\nWhile the SEC has approved investment vehicles tied to crypto futures in the past, it has not yet given approval for a spot BTC or ETH ETF on a U.S. exchange. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart speculated that if the commission approves a spot BTC ETF, it could potentially proceed with approving funds from multiple firms simultaneously.\n\nGrayscale submitted its filing in October, seeking to convert shares of its Grayscale Ethereum Trust into an Ether ETF. The company is among other firms, including BlackRock, Hashdex, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, and Fidelity, awaiting a decision from the SEC regarding their spot crypto ETF applications.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Solana (SOL), the fourth-generation blockchain, has staged a remarkable comeback, looking at on-chain metrics. Citing Artemis data, Step Data Insights on X noted that Solana\u2019s daily active wallets flipped Ethereum\u2019s, the pioneer smart contract platform. This development is when SOL prices have been ripping past resistance levels in the past few months.\n\nSolana\u2019s Resurgence Continues, Daily Active Wallets Flips Ethereum\n\nAccording to Step Data Insights, Solana\u2019s daily active wallets currently hover at around 400,000, slightly edging past Ethereum\u2019s. This spike in activity suggests that Solana is attracting a growing user base, and more people are keen to explore its ecosystems, comprising DeFi, NFTs, and other protocols.\n\nAdditional data from Artemis shows that Solana also eclipses Ethereum in the number of daily transactions. Although Ethereum leads in DeFi total value locked (TVL), Solana\u2019s low fee and scalable environment could explain why users opt for this high-performance network.\n\nOverall, the Solana recovery could triggered by recent favorable price action in Q4 2023. To quantify, Step Data Insights notes that SOL has risen by over 210% in the past three months. During this time, ETH\u2019s gains have capped.\n\nThe analytic platform states that the coin only rose by 39%. To illustrate, in the last three months, SOL rose from around $17 to peak at approximately $70. Meanwhile, ETH expanded from roughly $1,500 to peak at about $2,300, recorded on December 6.\n\nThis recovery points to increasing investor confidence. However, time will tell whether SOL will extend gains in the sessions. From the daily chart, prices have been moving horizontally for the better part of H2 November to early December 2023.\n\nThe immediate resistance line is at $70. With the SOL moving inside a bull flag, any upswing above November 2023 highs will be the building block for a possible leg-up that will lift SOL to April 2022 highs of $140.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Hopes, Firedancer Lifting Solana\n\nAltcoins, including Solana, have been racing higher as the crypto market recovers. Following a court ruling, SOL is relatively firm despite the FTX estate being permitted to liquidate the coin in the secondary markets to repay creditors.\n\nHopes of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving the first Bitcoin ETF have also benefited Solana. However, the recent release of Firedancer, a validator client developed by Jump Crypto, on testnet has supported SOL.\n\nThe client will make the network more resilient and performant. Firedancer will go live in the H1 2024. Once it goes live, the new client is expected to improve Solana\u2019s reliability.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

There was no lead investor in the round, and it was an equity plus token warrant round, Andrew Smith, founder and CEO of Versatus, told The Block.\n\nVersatus, formerly known as VRRB Labs, began raising for the round in June and closed it in August, Smith said.\n\nThe seed round brings Versatus's total funding to $3.7 million after a $1.4 million pre-seed round at a $20 million valuation in February. At the time, Versatus was working on a Layer 1 blockchain network, but it has now pivoted to a blockchain scaling platform due to a \"lack of market demand\" for an alternative Layer 1, Smith said.\n\nBuilding a 'stateless rollup'\n\nVersatus is now building a \"stateless rollup\" called LASR. The rollup chain doesn't maintain the entire state or data, which can lead to enhanced scalability. A stateless rollup takes \"only the absolutely necessary data\" of transactions and settles it on the base layer.\n\nLASR, which will settle on Ethereum for now, is layer agnostic and can work with any layer or blockchain, Smith noted. \"LASR can be a Layer 2 on top of a Layer 1, or it can be a Layer 3 on top of a Layer 2, and it can be an off-chain execution environment for Layer 1s,\" Smith said. As LASR is currently focused on Ethereum scaling, Smith added that it aims to reduce \"cost and inefficiencies of Ethereum, eliminate the friction and centralization associated with optimistic rollups, all while delivering a 100x better developer experience.\"\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nPartnering with EigenLayer and Stader Labs\n\nVersatus has partnered with several projects, including Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer and liquid staking platform Stader Labs. EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan said stateless verifiers, like Versatus LASR, \"are a key milestone in the future of the Ethereum scaling roadmap.\"\n\nLASR is currently in the alphanet stage and is expected to launch on the Ethereum testnet in the first week of January, with the mainnet launch scheduled for mid-March, Smith said. There are currently 15 people working for Versatus, and Smith plans to keep the team lean in the near future.\n\nLASR will be the first product of Versatus, and the startup plans to launch more products that will help bring more web2 developers into the web3 space, Smith said.\n\nBesides working for Versatus, Smith still serves on the board of and owns equity in his first startup OWL ESG, a tech-driven environmental, social and governance data provider, but he said he hasn't worked there day to day since founding Versatus."

        "content": "The SEC has extended its review period for Grayscale's Ethereum ETF application to January 2024, reflecting a careful evaluation approach towards cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nRecently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States of America made an announcement that they will be extending the decision-making time for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust's application for a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). In the past, the SEC had planned to reach a decision by December 6, 2023; however, they have now decided to postpone this until January 25, 2024. With this step, the regulatory body is demonstrating that it is taking a careful and comprehensive approach to the fast developing world of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nA significant participant in the investing of digital currencies, Grayscale Investments, submitted a Form 19b-4 in October with the intention of converting its Grayscale Ethereum Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). A significant amount of assets, totaling $5 billion, are managed by this trust, which has been active since March 2019 and has been conforming to SEC reporting criteria since October 2020. Grayscale's strong position in the Ethereum investment scene is shown by this statistic, which shows that it accounts for a hefty 2.5% of all ETH that is currently in circulation.\n\nIt is not an unusual occurrence that the SEC has decided to defer the decision. It is in line with their recent decision to postpone a decision about the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, which intends to combine spot ether and futures contracts. That decision was made. The SEC's pattern of deferrals demonstrates that it takes a cautious approach to new and complicated investment vehicles such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that deal with cryptocurrencies . The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has consistently delayed the approval of any spot ether or bitcoin fund, which reflects its emphasis on full review in the middle of the complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets. This cautious posture is reflected in the SEC's continuous delays.\n\nGrayscale and other companies, including BlackRock, Hashdex, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, and Fidelity, are now waiting for the SEC to make a judgment on their applications for spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The cryptocurrency investing community is actively monitoring the situation. Regardless of whether the verdict is favorable or unfavorable, it will have a huge impact on the future of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and their incorporation into mainstream finance. With its extended review timeframe, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) demonstrates its dedication to conducting a thorough review process, with the goal of ensuring market stability and protecting investors.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Rally Boosts NFT Market Surge - CoinGape",
        "content": "The recent upswing in the values of Bitcoin and Ethereum has led to a significant boost in various NFT markets. Notably, collections on Ethereum and Solana are experiencing a surge in value and interest. Pudgy Penguins, an Ethereum-based collection, has seen a 77% increase in its USD floor price over the past week, while trading volume has escalated by 397%. This surge indicates a strong recovery and growing investor confidence in NFTs linked to these blockchain networks.\n\nSignificant Rises in Major NFT Collections\n\nOther Ethereum NFT collections are also riding the wave of this revival. Azuki\u2019s floor price has risen by 25%, and stalwarts like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks have seen increases of 30% and 15%, respectively. Even the controversial Milady Maker collection has enjoyed an over 70% increase in floor price. These trends underscore a broader market revival, transcending beyond individual projects and signaling a possible end to the prolonged NFT winter.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSolana Collections Joining the Upswing\n\nThe positive trend isn\u2019t confined to Ethereum alone. Solana\u2019s NFT collections are also witnessing considerable growth. Mad Lads, a prominent Solana project, has seen its floor price jump by 52.6%, now valued at an impressive $10,219. This growth is not solely attributed to the recent Solana rally but also the unique benefits offered to the holders, such as connections to the Backpack app and an upcoming crypto exchange.\n\nOther Solana collections like Claynosaurz and Chads have also recorded significant gains in floor price and trading volume. Significantly, the recent developments in the NFT market, buoyed by the uptick in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, point towards a rejuvenated interest and confidence in digital collectibles.\n\nRead Also: Crypto Champion Patrick McHenry Ends 20-Year Congressional Run"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nGrayscale\u2019s hopes of launching a spot Bitcoin ETF were boosted by a legal victory over the SEC.\n\nThe firm has attempted to play the same move in its parallel Ethereum ETF bid.\n\nHowever, the Commission has nonetheless stalled a decision on Grayscale\u2019s application.\n\nIn its efforts to list crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the NYSE Arca stock exchange, Grayscale is engaged in a strategy game with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe prize? Permission to launch the first spot crypto fund in the U.S. But the SEC\u2019s stall and delay tactics might have Grayscale trumped.\n\nGrayscale Attempts Multipronged ETF Attack\n\nAlthough asset managers\u2019 efforts to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs have dominated the headlines, many of the same contenders are pursuing parallel bids to list equivalent Ethereum funds.\n\nAfter the SEC shut down its application to convert an existing BTC trust into an ETF, Grayscale won a key legal victory that has dramatically improved its chances of approval. In that case, the firm argued that it was unfair to forbid ETFs from investing in Bitcoin spot markets when they had permission to invest in crypto futures.\n\nOn the surface, it appears as if the same logic should apply to Grayscale\u2019s ETH trust. However, a technical difference in the way of filing existing Ethereum futures ETFs could undermine any such legal argument.\n\nIn its lawsuit against the SEC, Grayscale presented a 19b-4 futures ETF approval letter as evidence. However, current Ethereum funds received approval through a different process, and there is no equivalent letter the firm could present to make the same case again.\n\nI was initially unsure why they would even file for this. But my thoughts have evolved over the last few weeks and they are basically this:\n\nGrayscale is playing Chess, not checkers here. They're likely hoping to force the SEC into issuing a 19b-4 decision on an ETH futures ETF.\u2026 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 15, 2023\n\nAccordingly, when Grayscale filed its own 19b-4 ETH futures application in September, analysts lauded the move for its strategic genius, which could potentially force the SEC to accept spot Ethereum ETFs or risk another defeat in court.\n\nSEC Continues To Delay\n\nSo, has Grayscale checkmated its opponent, or does the SEC have one last ace up its sleeve?\n\nAt the very least, the agency has bought itself more time, announcing its intention to postpone a decision on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust on Tuesday, December 05.\n\nHere was the most recent list I put out. You can see 12/6 as the next date. pic.twitter.com/uZ6fOmPwFV \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 5, 2023\n\nIn its response to the proposed conversion, the commission said it needed more time to consider and extended the deadline for approval or disapproval until January 25, 2024.\n\nBy that time, the agency could have approved one or more spot Bitcoin ETFs, which it is currently bashing out the fine details of with Grayscale and others.\n\nOf course, nothing will be certain until the first spot crypto fund hits the market, but if Bitcoin ETFs do arrive soon, they will likely set the mold for any Ethereum-based funds that follow."

This was a marked departure from the all-time highs (ATH) of 97% seen during the end of 2022.\n\nEthereum weakens its relationship with Bitcoin\n\nAMBCrypto spotted a vertical drop in the relationship since November. While there was no telling evidence, the decoupling seemed to be caused by an increase in spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches.\n\nThe broader market bullishness was led by excitement over likely approvals of a dozen-odd spot Bitcoin ETF applications. This led to the start of the mid-October rally and by the time the month ended, BTC had accumulated gains of 26%.\n\nHowever, ETH was slow to match this pace, finishing October with 17% gains.\n\nHowever, the announcement of spot ETH ETFs by TradFi giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity turned it around for ETH in November. The second-largest crypto bounced above the crucial barrier of $2,000 for the first time since May 2022.\n\nTo put it simply, ETH reacted more to developments in its own ecosystem rather than a trickle-down effect.\n\nIt is important to understand that both assets function very differently from each other.\n\nNotably, Ethereum is used as a platform for the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value and a means of payment.\n\nWhat is the takeaway for investors?\n\nAs per a 21 April report by Coinbase, the lower BTC-ETH correlation makes a case for portfolio diversification, as holding both assets can result in higher returns.\n\nSmart investors spread their investments across different cryptos, reducing their exposure to any one category.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAs for institutional investors, the trend could impact their trading strategies like cross-hedging. For the curious, cross-hedging is a practice of managing risk by investing in two assets that have similar price movements but are not perfectly correlated.\n\nHaving said that, traders and investors should not take these as investment advice, and instead perform their due diligence."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nVeteran trader Peter Brandt comments on Ethereum price action as the market embarks on a fresh crypto rally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surged to $44,000 for the first time since April 2022. Ethereum, the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain network, also soared in response to the bullish impulse, touching highs of $2,312 in today's trading session.\n\nIn a new tweet, Brandt asks his 705,100 followers if Ethereum will emerge from the shadows anytime soon. He says that at least three narratives are possible, about which he launched a poll for his followers to participate in.\n\nVisual for reference pic.twitter.com/16YP1sZMQL \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 6, 2023\n\nBrandt's three narratives include a classic wedge that targets the $900 price for ETH. The second narrative is a running wedge pattern, which, if verified, has a price target of $3,300.\n\nThe famed trader's third narrative is \"Morphology ahead,\" which could imply that the Ethereum price action is still brewing and in the process of taking a particular form or structure. Brandt provides a visual representation of these price patterns.\n\nThe first option, the classic wedge, received 24% of votes in favor. The amount of 60.7% of respondents voted for the more likely option of a running wedge with a target of $3,300 given the current market standing. A total of 15.3% of the respondents voted for the 'Morphology ahead' option.\n\nTypically, a wedge pattern can indicate either bullish or bearish price reversals. A rising wedge (which indicates a bearish reversal) or a descending wedge (which indicates a bullish reversal) are the two types of wedge patterns.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH had gained 2.16% in the previous 24 hours and was trading at $2,264.\n\nIn ETF-related news, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced that it will take more than 45 days to review a rule change that would allow Grayscale to transform its Ethereum trust into an Ethereum spot ETF. The new deadline has been set for Jan. 25, 2024."

        "content": "Ethereum whales held around 38% of the total supply at press time.\n\nETH\u2019s supply has continued to decline.\n\nThroughout the year, Ethereum [ETH] whales have consistently made strategic moves, and recent reports indicated a noteworthy increase in their holdings.\n\nEthereum whales gather more supply\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock, the percentage of Ethereum supply held by large investors, known as whales, has increased over the year. The data showed a growth from 32% in January to around 35%.\n\nFurther examination of whale holdings on Santiment also showed an increase.\n\nInitial observations of the chart showed a clear upward trend in the past few months. In August, the percentage of whale holdings stood at about 34%, but as of this writing, it was over 38%.\n\nAn important question thus arises: How has this surge in holdings affected the overall supply of Ethereum on exchanges?\n\nEthereum: Supply on Exchanges continues to decline\n\nThe Ethereum supply on exchanges has exhibited minimal fluctuation in the recent period. However, it has shown a significant decrease over the last six months.\n\nChart analysis showed a decline of nearly 1 million units between August and the present. As of this writing, the exchange supply was around 10.51 million.\n\nConnecting the dots between the trends in exchange supply and the holdings of Ethereum whales, one might infer that the accumulation by large investors has influenced the overall supply.\n\nThe reduction in supply on exchanges implied a decrease in liquidity, which could exert a positive influence on the price trend.\n\nETH uptrend comes to a halt\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s examination of Ethereum\u2019s daily price trend showed a consistent accumulation by whales across various price ranges. Preceding this recent report, the chart indicated a continuous increase in the value of ETH over the past six days.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe uptrends resulted in around an 11% increase in value. However, at the time of this writing, there was a slight decline of almost 2%. Despite the decline, it has managed to maintain a stable price of around $2,200.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that if the percentage of supply held by these whales begins to diminish, it could signify capitulation. This is a crucial consideration, as a substantial release of volume onto exchanges might adversely impact the price trend."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as ETH Rises Above $2,300 \u2013 Can ETH Reach $3,500 by December 31?\n\nEther (ETH), the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization that powers the smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain, was last up close to 5% on Thursday and just hit fresh highs for the year in the mid-$2,300s.\n\nEthereum remains the dominant blockchain used by Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Token (NFT) and broader web3 industries, accounting for around 70% of the crypto industry\u2019s $107 billion in total value locked (TVL) as per DeFi Llama, which refers to the total value of all crypto locked in smart contracts.\n\nEther has been pumping in recent weeks amid a broader resurgence in risk appetite across the crypto market that saw Bitcoin this week surge to fresh yearly highs above $44,000.\n\nThat pump has come amid optimism about expected near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approvals and about a potentially imminent dovish monetary policy pivot from the US Federal Reserve, which could lead to a more favorable liquidity environment.\n\nBut with major asset managers like BlackRock also moving to create spot Ethereum ETFs, with the Ether supply having recent switched back to deflationary thanks to improving on chain activity and with Ether having substantially lagged Bitcoin\u2019s rally this year (ETH is up 96% year-to-date versus BTC\u2019s 164% gain), the case for strong near-term Ether price gains strong.\n\nRecent technical developments also support the case for further upside, with near-term price predictions likely to remain bullish as a result.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Can Ether (ETH) Reach $3,500 By December 31st?\n\n\n\nETH recently broke above and then found strong support at key long-term resistance in the $2,150 area.\n\nChart analysis shows that there aren\u2019t many key resistance levels now going all the way until 2022\u2019s highs in the $3,500 area, meaning quick potential upside of around 50% in the near future.\n\nWhether ETH could cover such distance to the upside prior to the 31st of December (i.e. in just over three weeks) seems unlikely but isn\u2019t be unheard of in ETH\u2019s price history.\n\nIn late July 2020, ETH rallied 57% in two week, followed by a more than 80% in the final week of 2020 and into the first week of 2021.\n\nThe last week of April into the first week of May 2021 then saw a more than 70% gain for ETH.\n\nWith technicals and fundamentals lining up at a typically strong time for the crypto market (i.e. a strong possibility of a santa rally), investors shouldn\u2019t bet against ETH hitting $3,500 this year.\n\nCrypto Alternatives to Consider\n\n\n\nWhile ETH offers strong upside potential for the weeks ahead, those looking to diversify into an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy should consider getting involved in crypto presales.\n\nThis is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.\n\nThese tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.\n\nMany of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.\n\nIf an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.\n\nThe team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.\n\nHere is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.\n\nSee the 15 CryptocurrenciesDisclosure: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

The price is now testing the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,188 swing low to the $2,316 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $2,250 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,320 zone. The next key resistance is near the $2,350 level. A clear move above the $2,350 zone could send the price toward the $2,420 level. The next resistance sits at $2,450. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,500 level.\n\nAre Dips Supported in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,320 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,265 level.\n\nThe next key support is $2,250 and the trend line. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,188 swing low to the $2,316 high. The main support is now near $2,200 or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A downside break below $2,200 might start an extended decline. The key support is now at $2,120, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $2,080 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,200\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,320\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

FTX supply coming here eventually and I think this move up is to bait some buyers. Would just be patient on Solana. Note: I think that this one is going to go much much higher in the future.\u201d\n\nAccording to Altcoin Sherpa, investors should remain patient with Solana as the incoming cache of SOL tokens from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX will add to its supply. However, the trader notes that during the last month, SOL has been consolidating.\n\n\u201cAlthough I think that you should still stay a bit patient given FTX supply is coming onto the market sometime (who knows when), Solana has also consolidated for a month in an overall macro healthy BTC (Bitcoin) upswing. In my opinion, this means you should at least be exposed now if you want in on this one.\n\nRecommend you do a swing trade on this one and have entries from here all the way down to sub-$50.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price saw an 18-month high at press time.\n\nWith the recent price uptick, ETH\u2019s price has become more prone to fluctuations.\n\nSharing a statistically significant correlation with the leading coin Bitcoin [BTC], whose price has rallied above $40,000, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] price has climbed to an 18-month high.\n\nOn the 4th of December, BTC briefly traded above the $42,000 price mark for the first time since April 2022.\n\nThis positive sentiment undoubtedly spilled over into the ETH market, as the altcoin exchanged hands at a high of $2,250 on the same day, a price level it last recorded in May 2022.\n\nNew highs, new troubles\n\nApart from its price rally, ETH\u2019s Open Interest has also risen significantly in the past few days. By the 4th of December, this had grown to over $4.5 billion, representing its highest level since February 2023.\n\nRising Open Interest alongside rising prices suggested that new money was coming into the market, fueling the bullish momentum. This signaled that the upward trend was likely to continue.\n\nHowever, with price volatility making a gradual comeback, the rally might be short-lived, as traders increasingly occupied leveraged positions.\n\nETH\u2019s Bollinger Bands indicator (BB), assessed on a daily chart, confirmed the possibility of significant price swings soon. At press time, the altcoin\u2019s price traded above the upper band of this indicator.\n\nLikewise, the gap between the upper and lower bands of the BB indicator has widened consistently since the 30th of November.\n\nA gradual widening of these bands typically indicated an increase in market volatility. The coin\u2019s Bollinger Bandwidth, which has grown since then, confirmed the rising volatility.\n\nDue to the recent price surge, ETH\u2019s estimated leverage ratio has risen. This indicated that, at press time, traders were borrowing more money to trade the leading crypto asset.\n\nETH\u2019s climbing leverage ratio is often seen as a bullish signal. Notably, it suggests that traders are confident that the coin\u2019s price will continue to rise.\n\nHowever, it is also risky, as traders with high leverage are more vulnerable to liquidations if the market moves against them.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nAMBCrypto found that ETH\u2019s funding rates have been only positive since the October rally, meaning that traders have continuously opened trade positions in expectation of a price rally.\n\nHowever, with the market approaching an overheated region, a drawback might result in the liquidation of some of these positions."

To forecast Ethereum's potential to hit this target, let\u2019s examine its technological infrastructure and historical market performance.\n\nEthereum stands apart from other cryptocurrencies through its foundational technology \u2013 it's a decentralized platform, built for decentralized applications dApps). At its core, Ethereum operates on a blockchain that supports smart contracts \u2013 self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.\n\nThis functionality has opened a wide range of possibilities, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Acronyms aside, there\u2019s a ton of potential in these innovative new products, the key being decentralization. This quality makes Ethereum the backbone of the current crypto-ecosystem, as the most popular applications in crypto are built on Ethereum.\n\nWhy Did Ethereum Crash?\n\nEthereum, like many cryptocurrencies, experiences intense market cycles characterized by rapid price increases followed by sharp declines. For instance, during the 2018-2019 period, Ethereum witnessed a significant crash following the 2017 crypto boom. After reaching a peak price of $1400, ether crashed below $100 in the subsequent years.\n\nThis pattern reflects a typical boom and bust cycle where the initial excitement and overinvestment (often fueled by FOMO) leads to inflated prices, which are unsustainable in the long run. The COVID black swan event in 2020, followed by increased money printing and record-low interest rates, demonstrates this trend.\n\nWhen Will Ethereum Hit All-time Highs?\n\nFor Ethereum to hit all-time highs depends on its technical progression and user adoption, as well as large macro trends. Two upcoming events could play a big role in moving the price of ETH upwards, which are slated to happen in 2024.\n\n\n\nThe Fed may pivot to risk-off with looser monetary policies in 2024. When money flows back into the economy, crypto historically acts like a sponge for the excess liquidity, benefiting Ethereum.\n\n\n\nThe second key event is the Bitcoin halving next year, which decreases the amount of BTC rewarded to Bitcoin miners by 50%, an action that has historically caused the crypto market to rally.\n\nHistory of Ethereum Prices\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price shows a pattern of volatility with significant peaks and troughs. For instance, after its launch in 2015, Ethereum saw a surge in 2017 during the ICO boom followed by a sharp decline in 2018.\n\nHowever, its recovery and subsequent growth, especially with the rise of DeFi and NFTs, indicates a growing confidence in its utility and value. Despite the crash in 2022, these trends may justify a price target of $10,000. While ambitious, it does not seem implausible in the next few years.\n\nCould Ethereum Hit $20,000?\n\nThe likelihood of Ethereum hitting $20,000 in 2024 is quite low, although some people believe in its potential and are willing to bet it will hit this mark next year. More realistically, ETH bulls who believe in the technology are holding for the long term.\n\nThe $20,000 mark is more believable if you are willing to hold for many years. If you zoom out on the ETH chart, you can see a 10x in ETH price has happened before, so you shouldn\u2019t rule it out of happening again.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum (ETH)\n\nYou can buy ETH on most trading platforms. One popular platform is Kraken, which offers many other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum layer 2s. The alternative to a trading platform is to use a non-custodial wallet and purchase from a decentralized exchange (DEX).\n\nIs Ethereum a Good Investment?\n\nInvestment in crypto is almost certain to be volatile. Many altcoins (cryptocurrencies that are not Bitcoin) have crashed to $0. However, Ethereum has shown staying power and has begun to provide enough utility that a lot of the speculatory risk has been lifted.\n\nIndividuals looking to get exposure to crypto outside of Bitcoin tend to hold ETH. The best way to understand if this is a good investment for you is to use the blockchain and get a better understanding of the decentralization philosophy. Then, you can decide for yourself whether this is something you want to trade or hold.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"

        "title": "Bloomberg Experts Forecast Timeline For Spot Ethereum ETF Approval - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The journey towards the approval of an Ethereum ETF in the United States has seen a new development yesterday as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced a delay in the decision for Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum trust conversion into a spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). The SEC has stated the need for an extended period to evaluate the proposed rule change, pushing the new deadline Grayscale to January 25, 2024.\n\nIn its reasoning, the SEC has reiterated, \u201cThe commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.\u201d Notably, the delay comes at a time where the US agency is working with now 13 spot Bitcoin ETF applicants on presumably the final amendments before a January 10 approval.\n\nTimeline For A Spot Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nDespite the latest delay, the crypto community remains optimistic about the future of spot Ethereum ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart has suggested that delays are par for the course, tweeting, \u201cUpdate: As expected Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum trust filing just got delayed. It was due by 12/6/23 so this is completely normal.\u201d\n\nSeyffart also shared a table of all seven spot Ethereum ETF applicants: VanEck, 21Shares & ARK, Hashdex, Grayscale, Invesco & Galaxy, BlackRock, Fidelity and their deadlines. He further hinted at potential approvals by mid-2024, responding to criticisms from Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, with \u201cUnfortunately I think you\u2019re gonna be really upset by June of next year.\u201d\n\nIn response to queries about the probability of an Ethereum ETF approval following a Bitcoin ETF, Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg has indicated that the first filers, Ark and VanEck, have strong odds of approval by their final deadline on May 23, 2024, as they are expected to use the same mechanics as spot Bitcoin ETFs, and due to the fact that Ether futures have already received the green light from the US SEC.\n\nQueried about for the odd of a spot Ethereum ETF approval, he remarked, \u201cNot formally yet, but final deadline for the first filers Ark and VanEck is May 23rd so strong odds they approved by then given they\u2019d be using same design as btc etfs and ether futures were Ok\u2019d.\u201d\n\nThe Next Deadlines\n\nThe table by Seyffart shows that the next Ethereum ETF deadlines are from December 23 to 26 for VanEck, Ark Invest and Invesco & Galaxy, followed by Hashdex on January 1. Since a spot Bitcoin ETF is very unlikely to be approved by then, delays by the SEC are more than likely for this batch of filings.\n\nBoth iShares by BlackRock and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund have their next deadlines on January 25 and January 21, 2024 respectively. These dates are crucial as they could involve either an extension, a request for more information, or a final decision.\n\nBut things only get really tense towards the final deadlines for all Ethereum ETF filers, as outlined by both Bloomberg ETF experts. With VanEck poised for May 23, 2024, and ARK Invest for May 24, 2024 and other notable filers like Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF and Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust Conversion (ETHE) scheduled for decisions by May 30, 2024, and June 18, 2024, respectively, the timeline for potential approvals is taking shape.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $2,271.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

He keeps a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. Whether he's trading or writing, Sohrab always keeps his finger on the pulse of the crypto world, using his expertise to deliver informative and engaging articles that educate and inspire. When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nStory Highlights ETC price action displays a strong bullish trend giving a range breakout.\n\nWith a remarkable breakout rally, the ETC price prepares for a jump to $25.\n\nThe uptrend can reach the $30 mark, if the ETC Price sustains momentum.\n\nMaking a bullish comeback in December, the Ethereum Classic price blazes up this Winter season. Ready to extend the 38% year-to-date growth, the ETC price lights up a breakout rally as it drinks up the increased momentum thanks to the recovery phase in the overall market.\n\nWith Bitcoin and Ethereum prices shooting higher above $40K and $2.2K, Ethereum Classic is ready to spread its wings and rise higher. Turning the ETC price prediction more bullish, the buyers are lining up to pay the premium for ETC tokens.\n\nSource \u2013 Tradingview\n\nWith the slow but gradual rise in the ETC price gaining momentum, the trend analysis marks a strong comeback. Making a rounding bottom pattern in the daily chart, the recovery rally plans a trend continuation to start 2024 at higher levels than 2023.\n\nThe recent bounceback within the continuation pattern finds an increase in the trading volume, reflecting a rise in demand. Further, the ETC price gives a bullish breakout as it crosses the long-term barrier at $20.\n\nWith a moonshot rally at high speed, Ethereum Classic has jumped by 16.26% in the last seven days to form consecutive bullish candles. Moreover, the ETC price trades at $21.52 with an intraday growth of 5.87%, forming a solid bullish engulfing candle.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nMACD: The MACD and signal lines give a bullish crossover signal in the daily chart, with the revival of positive histograms. Therefore, the momentum indicator supports the extension of the breakout rally.\n\nEMA: The golden crossover in the 50D and 200D EMA marks a trend reversal in the ETC price and signals entry opportunities for new buyers.\n\nWill ETC Price Reach $30?\n\nWith the eye-catching breakout of the $20 barrier, Ethereum Classic is ready to start a bullish breakout rally. Further, the rising sentiments lead to an increased capacity of investors to take risks fueling the altcoin market rally.\n\nUnder such supporting conditions, the ETC price gives a breakout rally and may shortly cross the $25 mark. If the uptrend exceeds the $25 mark, then the altcoin may start 2024 at levels greater than $30.\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum Classic fails to sustain the momentum, it may fall below $20 to test $17."

        "content": "Amid the massive bullish move by the vast number of assets in the cryptocurrency industry, Ethereum (ETH), as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is no exception, having rallied over 10% in the last seven days alone. So, is it too late to invest in it?\n\nAs it happens, renowned crypto trading expert Ali Martinez recently argued that Ethereum above $2,000 might just be a \u201cprime buying moment\u201d for the digital asset, considering that traders purchased a large volume of ETH around this price level, as Finbold reported on December 4.\n\nETH holders in/out of money. Source: Ali Martinez\n\nOver $3,500 in cards?\n\nEarlier, the professional crypto trader highlighted that Ethereum securing a \u201csustained weekly candlestick close above $2,150\u201d could pave the way \u201cfor an exciting uptrend,\u201d setting the price targets at $2,600 and at $3,500 afterward, as he explained in his chart pattern analysis.\n\nEthereum price action analysis. Source: Ali Martinez\n\nMore recently, the crypto analyst CoinsKid observed Ethereum\u2019s corrective flag from April to September, arguing it indicated that the asset \u201cshould be trying to tap the upper red line in time,\u201d referring to the price level at $3,602 in his analysis shared in an X post on December 6.\n\nEthereum price analysis and prediction. Source: CoinsKid\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that the crypto analytics platform Santiment has witnessed signs of \u2018fear of missing out\u2019 (FOMO) on Ethereum as open interest and longs increase, leading to its market value eclipsing $2,250 for the \u201cfirst time since May 11, 2022,\u201d or nearly 19 months.\n\nEthereum open interest and longs. Source: Santiment\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Ethereum is currently trading at the price of $2,280.76, recording a 3.40% gain on the day, as well as increasing 10.24% across the previous week and making a 20.88% advance on its monthly chart, according to the most recent data on December 6.\n\nEthereum 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn conclusion, considering its historical price action and analyses, there might still be time to invest in Ethereum. However, the asset looks to be making strong bullish attempts that could go even stronger in the near future under the right market sentiment, so the price might not stay at these levels for long.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Discover SCENE\n\nWith Bitcoin and Ethereum still gaining in recent days, gaming-centric tokens are broadly continuing pace\u2014with buzzy tokens tied to the Ronin and Beam networks leading the charge among large-cap projects.\n\nRON, the token of gaming-centric Ethereum sidechain network Ronin, has popped 21% over the last 24 hours to a current price of $1.75, continuing a recent surge in value for the token that\u2019s led to a 67% weekly gain and sizable 197% jump in the last 30 days per data from CoinGecko.\n\nRonin\u2019s rise has been tied in large part to rising adoption linked to Pixels, a popular blockchain game that recently migrated to the network from Polygon. Ronin active users jumped after the Pixels launch, plus Axie Infinity\u2014the monster-battling game that originally launched the network\u2014has also seen rising momentum lately amid the improving crypto market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBEAM, meanwhile, is the Ethereum-based token of Merit Circle\u2019s Beam gaming network, which is based around an Avalanche subnet. On Wednesday, Merit Circle announced that it would integrate the upcoming Immutable zkEVM network into the Beam ecosystem, with tools that play nice with the gaming-centric Ethereum scaling network.\n\nPrior to the announcement, BEAM climbed to a new all-time high price\u2014and then rose even higher once the news came out, hitting a new peak just above $0.017 overnight. BEAM has settled slightly to a current price of about $0.0162. It\u2019s up about 6% on the day, but 78% over the past seven days and 238% on the month.\n\nMerit Circle\u2019s own MC token is also up 11% on the day to $1.67, while Axie Infinity\u2019s AXS governance token is up 3% to $7.30 and the SLP in-game rewards token surged nearly 17% to $0.0034.\n\nOther notable gaming gainers include Immutable\u2019s IMX token, up 6% today to $1.47 with a 16% weekly gain, while Gala Games\u2019 GALA token is up 6% today above $0.03. GALA has now jumped about 25% over the past week, and 60% in the last 30 days.\n\nMuch like meme coins, gaming tokens tend to be more volatile than leading coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. That means when the market is green, they tend to show sharper gains\u2014though the opposite is typically true when the market is sinking.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin is up 16% this week to a current price of about $43,600, pushing its 30-day jump to nearly 26%. Ethereum has just about kept pace, up 15% this week to a current price of $2,339 and marking a 30-day pump of 26%.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "By Riley Kaminer\n\nETH is up 86% year to date, BTC is up 159.36%. Is it safe to say we\u2019re \u2018back\u2019 yet? Today\u2019s news coming from Miami web3 startup Versatus is yet another supporting data point.\n\nThe company announced that it has raised a $2.3 million seed round at a $50 million valuation. There was no single group leading the round, which included participation from NGC Ventures, Republic Crypto, and Hyperithm.\n\nOriginally founded as VRRB Labs, Versatus raised a $1.4 million pre-seed in February on the idea of building a Layer 1 blockchain network. Founder and CEO Andrew Smith told The Block that the company scrapped those ideas due to a lack of market demand.\n\nVersatus CEO Andrew Smith\n\nNow the company has pivoted toward developing what\u2019s called \u201cstateless rollup technology\u201d \u2013 a type of Layer-2 scaling solution that aims to address the scalability limitations of Layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nConfused? Let\u2019s break it down. Imagine you\u2019re trying to organize a large event. You need to keep track of a lot of information, such as who is attending, where they\u2019re sitting, and what they\u2019re eating. One way to do this is to have a central database that all the volunteers can access. This can be a bit inefficient, though, as everyone has to constantly update the same information.\n\nA better solution would be to use a decentralized system. In this system, each volunteer would have their own copy of the information. This would allow them to update their own records without having to worry about everyone else.\n\nStateless rollup technology is a bit like that. It\u2019s a way of making blockchains more efficient by decentralizing the storage of data. Instead of having all the data stored on every node in the network, it\u2019s stored on a smaller number of specialized nodes. This can make it faster and cheaper to use the blockchain, and it can also make it more resistant to censorship.\n\nAs stateless rollup technology matures, it is expected to play an increasingly important role in the future of blockchain technology. By enabling more efficient and scalable blockchains, stateless rollups can make blockchain technology more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nVersatus\u2019s LASR platform makes it easy for developers to create applications that use stateless rollup technology. This could have a lot of applications, such as making it easier to trade cryptocurrencies, or to create decentralized applications that are more efficient and secure.\n\nSpecifically in the context of Ethereum, the rails Versatus is currently focused on, Smith shared that Versatus hopes to reduce, \u201ccost and inefficiencies of Ethereum, eliminate the friction and centralization associated with optimistic rollups, all while delivering a 100x better developer experience.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, LASR is in a test phase, with plans to launch on the Ethereum testnet in the first week of January ahead of a full launch in mid-March. Versatus currently has 15 employees.\n\nBefore founding Versatus, Smith co-founded OWL ESG, an environmental social and governance data provider.\n\nREAD MORE IN REFRESH MIAMI:"

        "content": "A dormant Ethereum whale has resurfaced, moving their 39,260 ETH worth approximately $87.5 million. According to data from Lookonchain, this Ethereum whale with almost $90 million in ETH recently woke up and decided to move its mountain of digital assets to an exchange.\n\nAlthough it is unclear the motive behind this transfer, it appears to be to take profit on a 670% gain over the past five years.\n\nEthereum Whale Moves 39,260 ETH To Crypto Exchange\n\nThe crypto market has had another flurry of price increases in the past few days, with Coinmarketcap\u2019s Fear & Greed Index now pointing to an extreme greed of 81. Ethereum hasn\u2019t been left out of the price gains, and the crypto is currently up by 11% in a 7-day timeframe.\n\nAmidst the price gain, a social media post by on-chain analysis tracker Lookonchain shows that a whale recently deposited 39,260 ETH worth $87.5 million to the crypto exchange Kraken. Further details from on-chain data show that the coins were acquired around June to August 2017.\n\nDuring this period, the whale address received 47,260 ETH acquired at an average price of $240 and worth $11.34 million in total at the time. However, the account has remained largely inactive since then, sitting on unrealized profit as Ethereum continued to grow in price. But now, the coins have made their way into Kraken.\n\nThe massive transfer of funds from a whale\u2019s wallet to an exchange typically signals them cashing out some or all of their holdings. In this particular case, the whale would make a profit of approximately $78 million if they decided to sell all their holdings on the exchange.\n\nAn early $ETH whale appears to be selling ETH again after being dormant for 5 years. The whale deposited all 39,260 $ETH($87.5M) to #Kraken 30 mins ago. The whale received 47,260 $ETH($11.34M) at ~$240 from June to August 2017. If sold the whale would make a profit of ~$78M. pic.twitter.com/v0PI4LNTKO \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 5, 2023\n\nETH price succumbs to sell pressure | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nTrend Of ETH Profit Taking Increasing?\n\nA massive transfer of funds naturally leads to speculation within the crypto community, and there seems to be an increasing trend of large ETH holders taking profits. Other social media posts from Lookonchain over the past few days have shown similar cases of large wallets sending their ETH to exchanges.\n\nFor instance, a recent post showed the movement of ETH in wallet addresses belonging to defunct exchanges FTX and Celsius. FTX deposited 3,143 ETH worth $7.2 million on Coinbase, while Celsius sent 7,500 ETH worth $17.2 million to address \u201c0xc450.\u201d\n\nGalaxy Digital followed suit, depositing 9,179 ETH worth $20.9 million to Binance. According to Whale Alerts, 16,944 ETH worth $38.14 million also made its way to Coinbase from a private wallet.\n\nEven though Ethereum briefly touched $2,300 yesterday, it would seem the recent transfer to exchanges has had an effect on the price of ETH, as the crypto is trading at $2,269 at the time of writing, down by 1.5%.\n\nThe crypto market remains largely unpredictable, but it would be prudent to wait to see if the crypto approaches and rebounds at the $2,200 resistance level. At the same time, a strong blast above $2,300 could signal bulls are still in control.\n\nFeatured image from StormGain, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ethereum Price 2023 Breakthrough: Surpassing Bitcoin, Altcoin Surge Next? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "For the first time in 2023, the Ethereum price has outperformed Bitcoin across several metrics, hinting at a fundamental shift in market structure. The second cryptocurrency by market capitalization follows the general sentiment in the sector, setting new yearly highs.\n\nAs of this writing, the Ethereum price trades at $2,300 with a 4% profit in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency recorded a 10% profit, with most of the altcoin sector still lagging the current price action.\n\nEthereum Price Signals Strength For Altcoin Sector?\n\nA report from BlockScholes posted by the options platform Deribit indicates a spike in the Ethereum price volatility back to its levels above Bitcoin\u2019s. ETH\u2019s shift in market structure hints at traders and institutions gearing up for early 2024.\n\nThe report claims that the potential approval of a spot in the US ETH Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is behind the current price action. This new dynamic suggests that the bullish sentiment above this event slipped from Bitcoin to Ethereum.\n\nAs seen in the chart below, Ethereum records a higher return than Bitcoin for the first time since July 2023. The surge in returns, BlockSholes said, allowed ETH to buck a persistent downtrend, but overall, the cryptocurrency\u2019s performance remains in its yearly range.\n\nIn other words, the Ethereum price is doing better than in other periods across 2023 but has yet to resume a bullish momentum concerning Bitcoin. However, the report noted:\n\nThis reversal is not yet strong enough for us to be confident in a return to the market structure that we had previously come to expect, but does indicate that the effects of speculative bets around the application of a spot ETF are not limited to BTC. This is echoed by the implied volatilities for both assets across the term structure, which forecast similar volatility levels for both assets.\n\nWhat Favors An Altcoin Rally\n\nIn addition, the report noted a decline in the US dollar as measured by the DXY Index. Risk assets can thrive as the currency trends lower, potentially hinting at a loose monetary policy by the Federal Reserve (Fed).\n\nIf Ethereum continues gaining bullish momentum from its current levels, the entire altcoin sector could see further profits. The report indicates that most entities and traders are pricing in a \u201crisk event\u201d by the end of January 2024.\n\nThus, Bitcoin and Ethereum may see a more significant rally by that time. Whichever coin prevails might reveal more information on the subsequent trend; if Ethereum outperformed, then altcoins are more likely to follow.\n\nCover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Wed 06 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nWhile Bitcoin started 2023 with an explosive surge of over 140% since January, Ethereum remains lagging behind. However, despite solid fundamentals, ETH is still trading 54% below its all-time high. Undervalued, it could soon catch up and take off.\n\nEthereum in Bitcoin\u2019s Shadow\n\nSince the rally began in mid-October, Ethereum has seen a growth of about 30%, significantly less than the astronomical gains of Bitcoin which has jumped by 55%. Observers have noted that Ethereum has not benefited as much as its counterpart from the hype surrounding Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nNevertheless, the fundamentals of the Ethereum network remain impressive, as Ryan Sean Adams of Bankless reminded us yesterday: with its annualized profits of $2.7 billion and its price-to-earnings ratio of 98 \u2013 even surpassing Amazon\u2019s 75 \u2013 the current price of $2200 appears \u201claughable\u201d.\n\nMoreover, since the merge in September 2022, ETH has embarked on a deflationary trajectory, with a supply reduction of over 293,000 units according to Ultra Sound Money.\n\nIn addition, the attractive remuneration of 5.3% promised to validators for staking makes Ether the \u201cinternet bond\u201d. The asset also ticks the ESG boxes with its energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism.\n\nUpcoming Growth Drivers on the Horizon\n\nBeyond these solid fundamentals, Ethereum can also soon count on new catalysts. An Ether-backed ETF is likely in 2024, potentially attracting billions of dollars.\n\nSome are even already predicting a rally towards $10,000. It is thus the ideal time to buy before the actual rise begins.\n\nTherefore, with impressive fundamentals and bullish catalysts on the horizon like a possible spot ETF, Ethereum has great potential. Its current price reflects a clear undervaluation. A surge to new heights seems feasible in 2024.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) reached its yearly high of $2,310 per token on December 6. Amidst this surge, institutional giants deposited 19,822 ETH ($45.2 million) to cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nNotably, Galaxy Digital, Celsius, and FTX have signaled their intention to sell a relevant part of their stacks. SpotOnChain gathered this data from known crypto wallet addresses of these giant institutional investors.\n\nMoreover, Celsius and FTX have been constantly selling Ethereum and other tokens in 2023. Both companies filed for bankruptcy during the cryptocurrency bear market, which demanded these liquidations.\n\nHowever, Galaxy Digital is still operational under Mike Novogratz\u2019s leadership. Novogratz became known for his support of the collapsed Terra (LUNA) and a remarkable LUNA body tattoo.\n\nInstitutional Giants\u2019 ETH activity\n\nGalaxy Digital made three separate transactions, depositing 9,179 ETH to Binance at an average rate of $2,278, resulting in $20.9 million moved. Despite this sizable transfer, Galaxy Digital\u2019s wallets continue to hold 10,038 ETH, valued at approximately $22.8 million.\n\nGalaxy Digital on-chain portfolio. Source: SpotOnChain\n\nCelsius Network\u2019s activity was also notable, as it transferred 7,500 ETH at $2,273 each to a Coinbase intermediate address identified as 0xc45, cumulating $17.05 million.\n\nSince November 14, Celsius has moved a total of 44,769 ETH, tallying up to $94.7 million. Of this total, 37,269 ETH have already reached platforms, including Coinbase, FalconX, and OKX, averaging a transfer price of $2,084, amounting to $77.6 million.\n\nFinally, FTX, shifting 3,143 ETH to Coinbase priced at $2,294 each, accounted for $7.21 million of the collective outflow. Cumulatively, FTX and associated entity Alameda Research have moved assets worth $573 million to exchanges since October 24, 2023, including 28,427 ETH with a value of $54.3 million.\n\nThese movements from key giant institutional investors to crypto exchanges may imply a readiness to sell. Essentially, this could potentially exert downward pressure on Ethereum\u2018s market value.\n\nInterestingly, the timing coinciding with Ethereum\u2019s one-year high suggests that these institutions are seeking to capitalize on the recent price spike."

        "content": "Ethereum median gas price has surged to 55.3 Gwei this month, almost doubling in a month and reaching its highest point since mid-May this year.\n\nEthereum is trading at 2,230, up 10% over the last week and 81.3% over the last year, remaining the second most popular crypto after Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum Gas Fees Increase\n\nAs revealed by an analysis on Dune, Ethereum gas fees have surged over the last month. In October 2023, Ethereum experienced a notable reduction in gas fees, reaching a new low. The decline was attributed to decreased activity in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and various Telegram bots.\n\nMajor gas spenders, including industry giants like Binance and Coinbase and Layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, reduced their spending by 30% in mid-October.\n\nHowever, on December 1, the introduction of the Buterin Cards NFT collection triggered a 13% increase in gas fees on the Ethereum network. Transactions associated with this collection accumulated fees totaling 318.31 ETH in the past 24 hours, equivalent to $665,670.\n\nNotably, within three hours, transactions linked to the Buterin Cards NFT project contributed to over 13% of the total Ethereum network gas fees, surpassing fees from the Uniswap universal router address and Tether\u2019s public address, according to data from Etherscan.\n\nEthereum Gas Fees Have Been Fluctuating\n\nA substantial decrease in Ethereum gas fees occurred following the network\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism implemented through Ethereum 2.0.\n\nIt shifted away from the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model, introducing staking and resulting in a noteworthy 99.9% reduction in energy consumption.\n\nEthereum\u2019s gas fees have consistently mirrored the demand on the network throughout its history. Notably, during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom in 2017 and the decentralized finance (DeFi) explosion in 2020, Ethereum experienced unprecedented congestion. The heightened demand during these periods resulted in a significant surge in gas fees, forcing users to pay sometimes exorbitant amounts to guarantee fast processing of their transactions."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair from Binance offers a glimpse into Ethereum's current market position \u2013 a position that, while seemingly bearish, may hold the seeds for a future rally against the digital gold that is about to enter a consolidation phase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe chart presents a downtrend with Ethereum losing ground to Bitcoin, reflected by the downward slope of the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (black line) moving averages. This suggests that, in the short to medium term, Ethereum has been underperforming compared to the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\nThis underperformance can be linked to a subdued period for key Ethereum market drivers, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With these sectors facing a downturn, Ethereum's price has not had the catalysts that could propel it forward, especially in comparison to Bitcoin, which often acts as a \"safe haven\" within the crypto market during times of uncertainty.\n\nHowever, the development activity within Ethereum's ecosystem tells a different story. Despite the lack of immediate market drivers, the consistent work being done on the platform could be laying the groundwork for a strong rebound.\n\nFor traders, the ETH/BTC chart is a vital tool for tracking market sentiment and volatility. A declining ETH/BTC ratio could indicate a period of risk-off sentiment where investors flock to Bitcoin's relative safety. Conversely, a rising ratio might signal a risk-on environment where traders are more willing to bet on Ethereum's growth prospects, which might also hint at the potential surge of altcoins in general.\n\nGiven the current chart trends, investors and traders may look for signs of stabilization or reversal in the ETH/BTC ratio as indicators of Ethereum's resurgence. Such a turnaround could be precipitated by a revival in the DeFi and NFT markets or by new developments and upgrades within the network."

The strategist, who applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, says that the Solana/Bitcoin pair (SOL/BTC) has completed a bearish five-subwave pattern and is on the cusp of a move that could result in a gain of over 41%.\n\nAccording to the Elliott Wave theory, subwaves can be used to identify potential turning points in the market.

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced a 45-day extension for its decision on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust\u2019s application for a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). Initially set for a verdict by December 6, 2023, the SEC has shifted the deadline to January 25, citing the need for additional time to assess the proposal thoroughly.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Ethereum Endeavor\n\nGrayscale Investments, a leading name in digital currency investment, submitted a Form 19b-4 in October to transform its Grayscale Ethereum Trust into a spot ETF. Since its inception in March 2019, the trust has voluntarily adhered to SEC reporting standards from October 2020. With an impressive $5 billion in assets under management, it represents a significant 2.5% of all circulating ETH, positioning itself as a dominant player in the ETH investment landscape.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis decision delay by the SEC is not an isolated event. The regulatory body also recently postponed its decision on the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, which aims to incorporate spot ether and futures contracts into its portfolio. This pattern of deferrals suggests a cautious approach by the SEC towards the nascent but rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency ETFs. Meanwhile, other financial giants like BlackRock are also in the queue, awaiting regulatory green lights to launch their versions of a spot ether ETF.\n\nNo Room for Spot Bitcoin ETF Yet\n\nIn parallel, the quest for the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF continues. Grayscale and other entities like BlackRock and Bitwise have pursued this goal keenly. Despite their efforts and multiple applications, the SEC has consistently delayed its decisions, yet to approve any spot ether or bitcoin fund. This cautious stance reflects the regulator\u2019s emphasis on thorough evaluation amidst the complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets.\n\nAs Grayscale and its peers await the SEC\u2019s verdict, the world of cryptocurrency investment watches closely. Whether in favor or against, the decision will undeniably have significant implications for the future of cryptocurrency ETFs and their role in mainstream finance. The extended timeline indicates the SEC\u2019s commitment to a comprehensive review process, ensuring that any decision is well-informed and in the best interest of market stability and investor protection.\n\nRead Also: Elon Musk Gets Open Invitation to \u201cTalk\u201d From Argentina\u2019s New President"

        "content": "The volatility in the crypto market has intensified since last week, with bulls being on the offensive. Ethereum price extended the breakout above $2,000 reaching highs at $2,300 on Monday alongside the Bitcoin price rally above $44,000.\n\nWith 2.8% gains accrued in the last 24 hours, 11% in seven days, 12% in a fortnight, and 18% over the last 24 hours, ETH price is hovering at $2,260 while bulls search for higher support to keep the uptrend unscathed.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill Galaxy Digital Transfers To Binance Hold Ethereum Price Rally?\n\nBlockchain data monitoring company Lookonchain highlighted that Galaxy Digital, one of the leading digital fund managers in the industry, had transferred 9,179 ETH to Binance exchange.\n\nAccording to an image from Etherscan shared on X (Twitter), Galaxy Digital made three transactions comprising 3,079, 3,100, and 3,000 ETH with a combined dollar exchange value of $20.9 million.\n\nGalaxy Digital still holds 10,038 ETH worth approximately $22.8 million. Since the transfers to Binance could dampen the uptrend and push ETH price down, traders must plan accordingly and be alert to avoid falling into a bull trap.\n\nRecommended for you: XRP Price Prediction: Will XRP Pump To $1 Before 2024?\n\nFor now, there is a high probability Ethereum will springboard from support at $2,200. Several indicators reinforce the bullish theory starting with the fact that ETH holds above all three MAs\u2014the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the 50-day EMA, and the 200-day EMA.\n\nDespite the resistance at $2,300, Ethereum\u2019s position above the Ichimoku Cloud is a significant bullish signal. While traders may be uncertain whether they should buy now or wait for a bigger correction, chances seem to be high that dips would be profitable. Besides, bull markets tend to have trend reversals which allow other sidelined investors to buy into ETH ahead of the next potential breakout.\n\nThat said, it would be prudent to wait until Ethereum resumes the uptrend either from higher support at $2,250 or the grey region marked on the chart before entering new long positions, considering the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is falling back into the neutral area.\n\nFOMO could kick in as Ethereum price blasts through the resistance marked in red at $2,300. A sustained breakout would assure investors of the next major move to $2,500 and subsequently to $3,000.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "FaZe Clan Founder Banks Says Ethereum Is 'Large Percentage' of His Net Worth - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that prominent gaming influencer FaZe Banks loves crypto. Now, he\u2019s buying more.\n\nRichard \"FaZe Banks\" Bengtson is the CEO and co-founder of esports organization and lifestyle brand FaZe Clan. The gamer took to Instagram this week to report his latest crypto purchases and double down on his pro-crypto stance amidst a broader gaming industry where crypto remains a controversial topic.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be my typical normie homie and call me asking for plays a year from now when the mainstream media and your mom [are] talking about crypto again,\u201d Banks urged his 2.8 million Instagram followers Tuesday along with a note of Ethereum\u2019s price reaching $2,300, a yearly high.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cExpose yourself now,\u201d Banks continued in a post evangelizing crypto and arguing that potential buyers should look at Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.\n\n\u201cBTC is the safest, ETH is about as safe with slightly more upside in my opinion. My personal favorite. A large percentage of my net worth is in Ethereum,\u201d Banks wrote, adding that in his view, Solana is the \u201criskiest\u201d of the three cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cMy money is definitely where my mouth is on this one. Buy it and leave it alone. Chill,\u201d he added.\n\nLike many financial assets and purchases, though, it\u2019s important to note that buying or trading cryptocurrencies comes with risk\u2014and fans should be careful not to take financial advice from influencers or celebrities they follow online. It's often not clear what an influencers motivations may be in promoting a cryptocurrency, NFT project, or any financial asset.\n\nBanks also claimed that he recently spent $200,000 on four altcoins: Prime, Pepe, Mog, and Clouds, the last of which has not yet been officially released.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrime is the sci-fi NFT card game Parallel\u2019s official token, Pepe is a frog-inspired meme coin which recently rose to a $666 million market cap, and Mog is a meme coin that\u2019s been swirling on Twitter among fans who have paired it with memes of people and animals wearing a specific pair of colorfully-tinted glasses. Clouds is an upcoming token from the Endless Clouds crypto startup that is developing the Treeverse gaming platform.\n\n\u201cThese are the first real plays I\u2019ve made since the big market crash,\u201d Banks said, who over the summer also hopped onto the \u201cSocialFi\u201d trend and made over $70,000 by signing up for Friend.tech.\n\nBanks did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment on his latest crypto purchases.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that FaZe Clan\u2019s newly-appointed CEO has been in crypto for years now. Back in 2021, Banks was accused of allegedly pumping and dumping an altcoin he promoted, BankSocial.\n\nAnd a quick glimpse at a wallet connected to Banks called \u201cBanksfucks\u201d currently holds some NFTs from Azuki\u2019s collections, two Bored Apes, four Mutant Ape NFTs, a staggering 72 Otherdeed NFTs for Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse game, two Clone X NFTs, and one Doodles NFT, among others. He has also recently boasted of CryptoPunks holdings.\n\nWhile Banks is a crypto and NFT enthusiast, not everyone in FaZe Clan shares this view. The org\u2019s only current female member, Kalei Renay, previously told Decrypt in an interview at TwitchCon that she isn\u2019t a fan of NFTs.\n\n\u201cAs a community, everybody hates NFTs,\u201d FaZe Kalei said of gamers. \u201cIt\u2019s your money, do whatever, but I don\u2019t care for NFTs. I don\u2019t do crypto, I don\u2019t do any of that. I stay so far away from it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nSolana (SOL) cofounder Anatoly Yakovenko has muddled the Ethereum (ETH) hype after he compared the smart contract pioneer to Windows 95 operating software. Speaking on the Unchained Podcast with Laura Shin, Yakovenko argues that Solana is ahead of Ethereum and can be called Windows 2000, which in the evolution of computers is a proper operating system that can process multiple applications at a time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ethereum versus Solana debate is a volatile and unending one because the former pioneered the industry and set the pace for Solana. Anatoly Yakovenko himself has often come out to recuse himself from any inflammatory comparison between Solana and Ethereum, as he believes both can coexist.\n\nHowever, in the podcast, the Solana cofounder said the move to build Windows 2000 is necessary as the current bottleneck in the blockchain world, where a single NFT buzz can lead to a gas fee spike in an unrelated transaction, somehow negates what the proponents of the industry are pitching.\n\nDespite his clear position that is far from disdain for Ethereum, the community showed division in the comment, with one party supporting Ethereum and the other supporting Solana.\n\nWho laughs last? Solana or Ethereum\n\nThere is one underlying similarity between both blockchain networks, and that is the ability to host decentralized applications (DApps). The difference lies in their respective speed, cost and general public perception.\n\nDespite its woes, Ethereum is currently the most favored of the lot and boasts of a decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) of $28.661 billion against the $703.46 million of Solana. Only recently did Solana\u2019s trading volume exceed those of Ethereum L2s for the first time.\n\nWhile these figures are significant, both protocols are building for the future, and Solana\u2019s goal remains to become the Apple of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nThe next years will determine a lot about which of the two, or other Ethereum-killers, will stand the test of time."

NFTs are a type of cryptographic token that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular item, whether it be a piece of artwork, music, video, collectible, virtual real estate, or any other digital or physical\n\nEthereum NFT assets are unique digital assets that are created, bought, sold, and owned on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are a type of cryptographic token that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular item, whether it be a piece of artwork, music, video, collectible, virtual real estate, or any other digital or physical object. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum itself, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are indivisible and unique, each with its own distinct characteristics and value.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest blockchain platform after Bitcoin, has gained significant popularity and adoption for hosting NFTs due to its ability to support complex smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). NFTs on Ethereum are based on the ERC-721 token standard, although other standards like ERC-1155 are also used for creating NFTs.\n\nOne of the key features of Ethereum NFTs is their immutability and traceability. Each NFT has a unique identifier and a record of its ownership history stored on the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures that the ownership and authenticity of an NFT can be easily verified, and no one can counterfeit or duplicate it. The decentralized nature of the blockchain also eliminates the need for intermediaries or centralized authorities to oversee transactions, making it more transparent and secure.\n\nI am very bullish on Web3 gaming. The fact that we can own our game assets (NFT) is huge. Vitalik was inspired to create Ethereum for the similar reasons. When you own your game, you are the part of it, and that is what all players dream. But it\u2019s just the start \ud83d\udc47 \u2014 Singer (@Singer953) February 5, 2023\n\nCreating and owning Ethereum NFT assets usually involves utilizing decentralized applications, often referred to as NFT marketplaces. These platforms allow creators to mint or create NFTs by uploading their digital assets, specifying their desired properties, and generating a unique token. Once minted, these NFTs can be bought, sold, or traded on various marketplaces using Ethereum or other compatible cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe value of Ethereum NFT assets is largely determined by factors such as rarity, demand, uniqueness, and the reputation of the creator. Collectors and enthusiasts are often willing to pay significant amounts of money for rare or highly sought-after NFTs. The ownership of an NFT is typically represented by a digital wallet address, and the transfer of ownership is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain through a series of transactions.\n\nEthereum NFTs have gained significant attention and media coverage due to high-profile sales and unique use cases. Artists, musicians, and celebrities have embraced NFTs as a means to monetize their digital creations directly, without relying on traditional intermediaries. NFTs have also been used for virtual real estate, in-game items, digital fashion, and even tokenizing physical assets such as real estate or artwork.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s scalability limitations have led to high transaction fees and congestion during periods of high activity, which can pose challenges for widespread adoption and usage of NFTs. Efforts are being made to address these issues through network upgrades, such as Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum NFT assets are unique digital tokens representing ownership or authenticity of specific digital or physical items. They are created, bought, sold, and owned on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing smart contracts and decentralized applications. Ethereum NFTs have gained popularity for their ability to provide verifiable ownership and facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, revolutionizing the way digital assets are valued, bought, and sold.\n\nAlso read: Your Ultimate Guide To Ethereum Assets\n\nUse Cases of Ethereum NFT Assets\n\nEthereum NFT (Non-Fungible Token) assets have a wide range of use cases across various industries and domains. The unique properties of NFTs, such as indivisibility, verifiability, and scarcity, make them suitable for applications where ownership, authenticity, and provenance of digital or physical assets are important. Here are some prominent use cases of Ethereum NFT assets:\n\n1. Digital Art and Collectibles: NFTs have revolutionized the art world by allowing artists to tokenize and sell their digital artworks as unique digital assets. Artists can create limited edition or one-of-a-kind pieces of art, ensuring scarcity and exclusivity. NFTs enable provenance tracking, ensuring that the ownership history and authenticity of the artwork can be easily verified. Digital art marketplaces like SuperRare, OpenSea, and Rarible have gained popularity as platforms for buying, selling, and trading NFT-based digital art and collectibles.\n\n2. Gaming and Virtual Assets: NFTs have found significant applications in the gaming industry, enabling players to own and trade in-game items, characters, and virtual assets. These assets can be bought, sold, and transferred securely using NFTs, providing players with true ownership and the ability to monetize their gaming achievements. Blockchain-based games like Axie Infinity, CryptoKitties, and Decentraland have gained widespread popularity, showcasing the potential of NFTs in the gaming space.\n\n3. Music and Entertainment: NFTs are being used to revolutionize the music and entertainment industry. Musicians can release exclusive music tracks, albums, or concert tickets as NFTs, allowing fans to own unique digital memorabilia. NFTs can provide additional revenue streams for artists, enable direct fan engagement, and provide transparency and traceability for royalty payments. Platforms like Audius and Rarible have emerged as NFT marketplaces for music and entertainment.\n\n4. Virtual Real Estate: NFTs have been used to represent ownership of virtual land, buildings, and properties in virtual worlds or metaverses. Users can buy, sell, and develop virtual real estate, creating unique and immersive experiences. Platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox offer virtual environments where users can trade NFT-based virtual properties and monetize their creations.\n\n5. Domain Names and Identity: NFTs can be used to represent ownership of domain names, allowing users to buy, sell, and transfer unique internet addresses securely.

Sorare Sorare is a fantasy football game that uses NFTs to represent players.\n\nBenefits of Ethereum NFT Assets\n\nEthereum NFT (Non-Fungible Token) assets offer several benefits that have contributed to their widespread adoption and popularity. Here are some of the key advantages of Ethereum NFT assets:\n\n1. Ownership and Authenticity: NFTs provide a robust and verifiable system for proving ownership and authenticity of digital or physical assets. Each NFT has a unique identifier and a record of its ownership history stored on the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures that the ownership and provenance of an asset can be easily traced and verified, mitigating the risk of fraud or counterfeit.\n\n2. Scarcity and Exclusivity: NFTs enable the creation of unique digital assets or limited editions, ensuring scarcity and exclusivity. This scarcity drives the value of NFTs, as collectors and enthusiasts seek rare and unique items. NFTs allow creators to assign specific attributes or properties to each asset, making them one-of-a-kind or part of a limited set.\n\n3. Direct Peer-to-Peer Transactions: Ethereum NFTs facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. Traditional markets for art, collectibles, and other assets often involve complex intermediaries, such as galleries, auction houses, or licensing agencies. NFTs enable creators to sell their assets directly to buyers, streamlining the transaction process and reducing associated fees.\n\n4. Monetization and Revenue Streams: NFTs provide new avenues for creators and artists to monetize their digital creations. By tokenizing their work as NFTs, creators can sell their assets directly to buyers, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries. This allows artists to retain more control over their work and generate revenue from the primary and secondary sales of their NFTs.\n\n5. Programmability and Smart Contracts: Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality enables programmability and automation of various functions associated with NFTs. Smart contracts can be used to set royalty fees, ensuring that artists receive a percentage of the proceeds whenever their NFTs are resold. Additionally, smart contracts can include additional functionalities like unlocking additional content or features based on certain conditions or events.\n\n6. Interoperability and Standards: Ethereum NFTs adhere to standardized token standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155, ensuring interoperability across different applications, platforms, and wallets. This means that NFTs created on one platform can be easily transferred, traded, or integrated with other platforms and services, enhancing liquidity and utility.\n\n7. Transparency and Auditability: NFTs are built on the Ethereum blockchain, a decentralized and transparent ledger. The ownership history, transaction details, and metadata associated with each NFT are publicly accessible and cannot be altered. This provides transparency and auditability, instilling trust in the authenticity and ownership of NFT assets.\n\n8. Fractional Ownership and Liquidity: NFTs can be fractionalized, allowing multiple investors to own a fraction of an asset. This enables broader access to high-value assets that were previously out of reach for individual investors. Fractional ownership also enhances liquidity, as these fractions can be traded on secondary markets, enabling investors to buy and sell smaller portions of an asset.\n\n9. Global Reach and Accessibility: Ethereum NFT assets are not limited by geographical boundaries. Anyone with an internet connection and an Ethereum wallet can participate in buying, selling, or trading NFTs. This global reach opens up new markets and opportunities for creators, collectors, and investors worldwide.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while Ethereum NFT assets offer many advantages, there are also challenges and considerations to be aware of, such as scalability issues, high transaction fees during peak demand, and environmental concerns related to energy consumption. As the technology continues to evolve, addressing these challenges will be crucial for the sustainable growth and long-term viability of Ethereum NFTs.\n\nAlso read:How Has Ethereum Network Improved The Adoption Of Crypto Projects\n\nFuture of Ethereum NFT Assets\n\nThe future of Ethereum NFT assets holds significant potential for further innovation, growth, and adoption. Here are some key aspects that shape the future of Ethereum NFT assets:\n\n1. Enhanced Scalability: Ethereum has been facing scalability challenges, resulting in high transaction fees and network congestion during periods of high activity. To address this, Ethereum is undergoing a major upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0. This upgrade aims to improve scalability through the implementation of a more efficient consensus mechanism (Proof of Stake) and the introduction of shard chains. By increasing the network\u2019s capacity, Ethereum 2.0 will support a larger volume of NFT transactions and foster wider adoption.\n\n2. Improved User Experience: User experience is a critical aspect for the mass adoption of NFTs. Efforts are being made to simplify the process of minting, buying, and selling NFTs, making it more accessible to users with minimal technical knowledge. User-friendly interfaces, better wallet integration, and streamlined transaction processes will contribute to a more seamless and intuitive experience for creators, collectors, and investors.\n\n3. Cross-Chain Interoperability: Interoperability between different blockchain networks is becoming increasingly important for NFTs. Projects like Polkadot, Cosmos, and others are working on cross-chain solutions that enable NFTs to move seamlessly between different blockchains. This interoperability will expand the reach of NFT assets, connect various ecosystems, and increase liquidity by allowing assets to be traded on multiple platforms.\n\n4. Integration with Physical Assets: The convergence of NFTs with physical assets holds great potential. By tokenizing physical assets, such as real estate, luxury goods, or artwork, NFTs can enable fractional ownership, liquidity, and easier transfer of value. NFTs can serve as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds, facilitating trust, provenance, and verification of ownership for real-world assets.\n\n5. Enhanced Utility and Functionality: NFTs are not limited to representing ownership of art or collectibles. In the future, NFTs can have programmable features and additional utility. For example, NFTs can unlock access to exclusive content, grant special privileges in games or virtual worlds, or serve as digital identity representations. The integration of smart contracts and additional functionalities will expand the use cases and value proposition of NFT assets.\n\n6. Tokenization of Intellectual Property: NFTs have the potential to revolutionize intellectual property rights and ownership. Creators can tokenize their intellectual property, such as patents, trademarks, or copyrights, and sell or license them as NFTs. This can create new revenue streams for creators and simplify the management and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\n\n7. Environmental Sustainability: As the popularity of NFTs grows, concerns regarding the environmental impact of the energy consumption associated with blockchain networks, particularly Ethereum, have emerged. The Ethereum community is actively working on addressing these concerns by transitioning to more energy-efficient consensus mechanisms and exploring layer-two scaling solutions. These efforts aim to make Ethereum and NFTs more environmentally sustainable in the long run.\n\n8. Regulatory Landscape: As NFTs continue to gain prominence, regulatory frameworks will likely evolve to address legal and compliance aspects. Governments and regulatory bodies may introduce guidelines or regulations to ensure investor protection, prevent fraud, and address issues related to copyright infringement or money laundering. The establishment of clear and favorable regulations can provide a stable and predictable environment for the growth of NFT assets.\n\nIn summary, the future of Ethereum NFT assets looks promising with advancements in scalability, user experience, interoperability, integration with physical assets, utility enhancements, intellectual property tokenization, sustainability efforts, regulatory frameworks, and the continuous innovation within the blockchain ecosystem. As these developments unfold, Ethereum NFTs are expected to become more accessible, valuable, and integral to various industries, unlocking new possibilities for creators, collectors, and investors worldwide."

        "title": "Censorship Climbs on Ethereum as Block Builders Bar US-Sanctioned Transactions - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Decentralization Questioned as Block Builders Censor Transactions Tied to US Sanctions\n\nA pillar of Ethereum\u2019s original vision was decentralization\u2014the idea that its blockchain would operate outside constraints from centralized entities like governments and corporations. Recent data indicates this ideology is being tested, however, as key Ethereum players increasingly censor transactions linked to US sanctions.\n\nThe Turn Toward Censorship\n\n\n\nA major turning point came last year when the US Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash, an Ethereum mixing service that enabled private transactions. OFAC claimed the tool was utilized by terrorists and other illicit actors.\n\nIn response, Tornado Cash\u2019s code was added to the same US blacklist containing bad actors like North Korea and Hamas. Supporters decried the targeting of Tornado Cash as government overreach and censorship. Ethereum has not proven immune, however.\n\nIn recent months, censorship of transactions tied to US sanctions has markedly increased on Ethereum, according to new research from Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter. A metric measuring \u201ccensored\u201d blocks on Ethereum surged from around 25% in November 2022 to approximately 72% currently.\n\nThis spike stems largely from block builders, who assemble transactions into blocks and provide them to validators to add to Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. Five major block builders now contribute over 90% of Ethereum blocks. Of those, only one major builder, Titan Builder, claims it does not filter transactions in this manner.\n\nThe lone block builder still processing all transactions claims over 20% of blocks. If Titan began engaging in censorship as well, per Wahrst\u00e4tter\u2019s analysis, overall Ethereum censorship could immediately jump to over 90%. Such reliance on a few builders contradicts the decentralized ethos blockchain promised.\n\nImpacts on Ethereum\u2019s Core Values\n\n\n\nFor many in the Ethereum community, such censorship represents a betrayal of the network\u2019s founding principles. The technology\u2019s decentralized appeal rests on it being uncontrolled and unfettered by real-world biases. Yet block builders now hold immense power over which transactions end up on Ethereum, granting them the power to selectively exclude addresses flagged by OFAC.\n\nSome builders defend this censorship as merely prudent compliance with US regulations. However, critics argue it sets a dangerous precedent of centralized entities overriding Ethereum\u2019s core coding to meet external rules. It also limits full access to the blockchain for individuals sanctioned by the US government.\n\nF2Pool was filtering (censoring) OFAC Bitcoin transactions recently and everyone got mad and then they stopped almost immediately. Can Ethereum do the same with censoring builders? As in, just ask that they stop. Like is this a corollary would you say or no? pic.twitter.com/6NUBmoEWuF \u2014 Gwart (@GwartyGwart) November 29, 2023\n\nCentralization Creeping In\n\n\n\nBeyond censorship, the centralization of key transaction functions into a few dominant block builders could pose security risks, according to experts. Further, these players gain privileged access to pending transaction data, potentially allowing them to maximize profits through trading strategies before transactions are added to the blockchain. This raises additional questions about fairness and transparency.\n\nEthereum was designed as a decentralized network not beholden to external constraints. Block builders processing transactions increasingly censor addresses tied to US sanctions, however, calling Ethereum\u2019s decentralization into question. While some view this censorship as prudent legal compliance, critics see it as contradicting Ethereum\u2019s core values.\n\nIn response to these concerns, Ethereum\u2019s leadership is exploring ways to curb censorship trends. Vitalik Buterin has proposed updates that inhibit transaction blocking by validators and builders.\n\nThis challenge to Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ethos may prove to be a defining one, forcing the community to confront difficult questions about the limits and future direction of the technology. The answers could shape Ethereum\u2019s ability to evolve while retaining the core principles on which it was founded."

        "content": "Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum ETF stalls: SEC extends review to January 2024\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended the evaluation period for Grayscale\u2019s proposed Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nThe U.S. top watchdog said it needs more time to review the proposed rule change that would enable NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust as an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe SEC has set a new deadline for its decision or the initiation of proceedings to determine its disapproval, which is January 25, 2024. This extension allows the SEC more time to thoroughly assess the proposal and address any concerns raised, it said.\n\n\u201cThe commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d reads the SEC\u2019s official notice today.\n\nGrayscale submitted its application in October, seeking to convert shares of its Grayscale Ethereum Trust into an Ether ETF. The company is one of several firms, including BlackRock, Hashdex, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, and Fidelity, waiting for the SEC to make a decision regarding their spot cryptocurrency ETF applications.\n\nOpinions are divided on the SEC\u2019s next steps towards crypto-based ETF proposals. Some view the regulator\u2019s decision not to appeal in the Grayscale case as a positive sign. In contrast, others remain skeptical, hinting that SEC Chair Gary Gensler might have unforeseen plans.\n\nWhile the SEC has approved investment products tied to cryptocurrency futures in the past, it has not yet given approval for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) ETF on a U.S. exchange. If the commission approves a spot BTC ETF, it could proceed with approving ETFs from multiple firms simultaneously, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.\n\nThe delay in Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum spot ETF proposal follows a previous delay by the SEC in deciding about the company\u2019s filing for an Ethereum futures ETF, which was submitted in September.\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust currently stands as the world\u2019s largest ether investment product, managing almost $5 billion in assets. When launching a new crypto ETF, regulatory authorization is typically sought from the exchange that lists the ETF\u2019s shares, rather than the sponsor itself.\n\nSimilar to Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin fund, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust is the largest Ethereum investment vehicle globally, accounting for 2.5% of all circulating ETH.\n\nThe conversion into a spot ETF has been the long-term plan for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust since its launch in 2019. Presently, ETHE shares trade at a significant 30% discount compared to the underlying ETH held by the trust. While the trust\u2019s ETH holdings are valued at approximately $5.14 billion, its shares total only around $3.6 billion."

        "content": "Ethereum's recent performance has raised many questions about its potential for further upward movement. Over the weekend, Ethereum experienced a significant surge, indicating that the $2200 level, possibly extending down to the $2100 level, is now providing short-term support. This development suggests a growing inclination among investors to adopt a \"buy on the dips\" strategy, reflecting confidence in Ethereum's upward trajectory. The cryptocurrency has been consistently bullish, bolstered by expectations regarding the United States' monetary policy, which is a crucial factor influencing its value. Currently, traders are speculating that the Federal Reserve is going to start cutting rates in March.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nCheap Money Drives Market, Or At Least the Idea of It\n\nEthereum's growth is closely tied to the availability of inexpensive money and low interest rates in the United States. These economic conditions create an environment conducive to Ethereum's ascent.\n\nEthereum plays a foundational role in blockchain applications, although its broader utilization within blockchain technology is still evolving.\n\nThe speculative nature of Ethereum is a key aspect of its appeal to investors, with the primary objective being the potential for profit.\n\nCurrently, the trajectory for making profits in the Ethereum market appears to be on the upside. A decisive break above the $2300 level could pave the way for Ethereum to reach the $2500 mark over time. The 50-Day Exponential Moving Average is located at the lower boundary of Ethereum's recent consolidation zone, suggesting that it could provide a robust short-term foundation for the market. This level might also represent the base of the uptrend, especially if Ethereum faces significant selling pressure. This is going to be a potential buying opportunity, assuming you even get it. This is a market that will also follow Bitcoin as well \u2013 so pay attention to that market at the same time.\n\nOverall, Ethereum's market dynamics are influenced by several factors, including global monetary policies, its role in blockchain technology, and its speculative nature. Investors are closely monitoring these aspects, as they are fundamental to Ethereum's value and its potential for future growth. The market sentiment is currently bullish, with key technical levels offering insights into potential support and resistance points. As Ethereum continues to evolve within the digital currency landscape, staying informed and adaptable will be vital for investors navigating this volatile and opportunity-rich market.\n\nReady to trade our Ethereum forecast?

The concept of \"market memory\" is particularly relevant here, as past resistance levels often transform into support in future market movements. While the general sentiment leans towards buying, finding value in the market is crucial for making informed investment decisions.\n\nThe anticipation is that Ethereum might eventually target the $2500 level. However, this progression requires careful market observation, particularly regarding the bond market. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have shown a heightened sensitivity to changes in interest rates, making the 10-year yield a significant factor to consider. Crypto investments require an influx of speculative capital, often referred to as \"hot money,\" to drive prices upward. This characteristic makes cryptocurrencies an investment on the extreme end of the financial spectrum \u2013 offering high potential returns but equally significant risks.\n\nFOMO and the Death of Crypto Traders\n\nInvestors and traders in the crypto market need to approach with caution, particularly in terms of position sizing. The allure of quick gains can often lead to impulsive decisions, characterized by \"Fear of Missing Out\" (FOMO) trades, which have been the downfall of many in the crypto space. Patience and identifying value are key strategies in navigating this volatile and unpredictable market.\n\nCurrently, the perceived \"floor\" of the market for Ethereum is around the $1925 level, which is the base of the previous consolidation area and coincides with the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average.

Behavior analytics tool Santiment observes that Ether and altcoins are on a tear even as BTC momentum fades.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH attempts to flip $2,300 into support\n\nEthereum and altcoins blast off\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is up almost 5%, with the daily price updates flashing green alongside its peers in the altcoin category against Bitcoin (BTC) price, which is showing red.\n\nBTC versus ETH and altcoins\n\nAccording to Santiment, the capital is flowing away from Bitcoin and into Ethereum and altcoins amid fears that \u201cthe market may be in a bull trap at the moment.\u201d\n\nFor the layperson, a bull trap in crypto trading refers to a false signal indicating a market in a temporary uptrend is going to continue upward. However, the trend quickly reverses, leading to a decline. Oftentimes, this decline leads to lower prices compared to when the bull trap commenced.\n\nNevertheless, the on-chain behavior analytics tool acknowledges that if the fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) continues, it could in fact be the driving force for Bitcoin price hitting the desirable $50,000 psychological level.\n\nIt is the same FUD, however, that has the likes of Senator Elizabeth Warren saying, \u201cthere is a new threat out there, it is crypto and we cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\n\"There's a new threat out there, it's crypto.

With this perspective, Bitcoin price is bullish on a big-picture perspective, with the capital overflows benefiting altcoins.\n\nTo put this in perspective, apart from BTC and Ethereum, the total market capitalization of other altcoins is likely to breach through an 19-month-long downtrend that prompted a decline in market capitalization since May 2022.\n\nTotal altcoins market capitalization, excluding Ethereum"

Experts are now anticipating a bullish trend for ETH, projecting a potential ascent towards the $2,500 mark.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Positive Momentum Persists\n\nMaintaining its positive trajectory akin to Bitcoin, Ethereum has sustained its upward movement above the $2,120 threshold. The cryptocurrency extended its rally, breaching key resistance levels at $2,200 and $2,250, prompting a surge in activity from bullish investors and propelling the price beyond $2,300.\n\nAlthough a new multi-month high was established at approximately $2,316, the current market scenario sees a correction in gains. The price has dipped below the $2,300 level and is currently undergoing a test of the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, measured from the $2,188 swing low to the $2,316 high.\n\nNotably, Ethereum is presently trading above $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Additionally, an observable bullish trend line is taking shape, offering support around the $2,250 mark on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nFacing resistance in the vicinity of the $2,320 zone, Ethereum\u2019s immediate hurdle is the $2,350 level. A decisive breakthrough above this resistance could propel the price towards the $2,420 level, with subsequent resistances standing at $2,450. Further gains have the potential to trigger a surge towards the $2,500 level.\n\nHowever, should Ethereum encounter difficulty in surpassing the $2,320 resistance, a downside correction may ensue. Initial support on the downside is identified near the $2,265 level, followed by key support at $2,250 and the aforementioned bullish trend line. The latter coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent upward move.\n\nIn the event of a more pronounced decline, Ethereum\u2019s primary support lies around $2,200, corresponding to the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A breach below $2,200 raises the possibility of an extended decline, with the key support level at $2,120. Falling below this level could expose Ethereum to a potential move towards the $2,080 range in the near term."
