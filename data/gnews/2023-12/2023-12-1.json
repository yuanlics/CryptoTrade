        "content": "Alameda Research\u2019s ETH holdings were moved.\n\nInterest from whales in ETH was high.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] price rallied quite a bit over the last few weeks, after BTC\u2019s prices surged. This momentum inspired optimism in the market towards ETH, however, it could soon come to an end.\n\nIs ETH in trouble?\n\nAlameda Research, the cryptocurrency trading firm founded by Sam Bankman Fried, recently, moved most of its assets.\n\nOne of the largest moves made by the firm was the offloading of a bunch of its ETH. According to lookonchain\u2019s data, the firm transferred 1,643 ETH. This amounted to almost $3.43 million.\n\nThis sell-off could affect the price of ETH going forward. Solana faced a similar issue when news broke that Alameda Research will be allowed to move its funds.\n\nHowever, SOL was one of their largest holdings, so the potential price response to this move would be very large. The same couldn\u2019t be said about ETH, as Alameda, despite holding a large amount of ETH, could not make a similar level of impact with its sell-off.\n\nWhales show faith\n\nHowever, the behavior of other whales coinciding with this move could affect market sentiment in the future.\n\nAt press time ETH was trading at $2,095.05 and its price had fallen by 0.05%. Luckily for ETH, other whales were not as interested in selling their ETH.\n\nAccording to Santiment\u2019s data, the percentage of addresses holding ETH had grown. This suggested that large addresses were continuing to show interest in ETH.\n\nIf the pattern persists, the growing interest shown by whales may help ETH in resisting massive sell-offs such as the Alameda Research move.\n\nThis will play a key role in the future of ETH, especially as the MVRV ratio for ETH grows, which means that the number of ETH holders will be profitable.\n\nDue to this, retail investors may want to sell their holdings in the future for some profit which whale interest may protect ETH against.\n\nState of the network\n\nHowever, the high concentration of whales may have negative consequences for ETH as well.\n\nThe whales may be able to manipulate the price of ETH, due to their large positions, and they could leave retail investors in the dust.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nComing to the state of the network, it was seen that the gas usage on Ethereum remained consistent.\n\nEven though gas usage was on the rise, interest in NFTs on Ethereum had started to fall."

        "content": "The Ethereum network\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have dropped by an estimated 99.97% since its shift to proof-of-stake, despite a big rise in node count.\n\nThat\u2019s according to new research by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. The organization has upped its crypto research effort after in April launching the Cambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Index (CBNSI) \u2014 a measure that detailed Ethereum\u2019s electricity consumption pre- and post-Merge.\n\nThe Ethereum network currently is responsible for 2.8 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (KtCO 2 e) on an annualized basis, the CCAF said in a Friday report.\n\n\u201cTo contextualize, this would equate to the emissions from five round-trip airplane flights from London to New York, the annual energy consumption-related emissions of 450 UK households, or the annual carbon sequestration capacity of 270 acres of forest,\u201d the report states.\n\nEthereum switched to a proof-of-stake consensus model in September 2022. The Ethereum Foundation had estimated the Merge would reduce the blockchain\u2019s power consumption by 99.95%.\n\nRead more: Ethereum switches to proof-of-stake after 7 years of work\n\nBut electricity usage is only one piece of an environmental impact assessment, according to the Friday report.\n\nAdditional data was required to convert electricity consumption to greenhouse gas emissions. The CCAF used off-chain data from the peer-to-peer communication of Ethereum nodes to gather both electricity usage and the geolocational distribution of nodes.\n\nThe number of Ethereum validators has grown 57% since April 1, reaching 880,822. Ethereum nodes have grown to 14,072, reflecting a 23.2% increase over that span.\n\nThe network\u2019s annual electricity consumption increased by 21.2% in those eight months, from 6.19 GWh to 7.50 GWh \u2014 roughly the annual electricity use of 2,000 English households, the Cambridge data shows.\n\nAs for where the nodes are, Europe and North America are home to 43.3% and 40.5% of them, respectively, following the Merge.\n\nSource: Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF)\n\nThe CCAF estimates pre-Merge greenhouse gas emissions were about 10.3 MCO 2 e. The latest post-Merge figure of 2.8 KtCO 2 e reflects a 99.97% drop despite a substantial increase in the number of Ethereum nodes, the report notes.\n\nThe network is now powered by nearly 48% sustainable energy \u2014 including 32% renewables and 16% nuclear \u2014 the CCAF estimates, with the remaining 52% coming from natural gas, coal-fired power, and oil.\n\nThe CCAF said it next looks to enhance its Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI). Despite Ethereum\u2019s shift to proof-of-stake, bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work consensus model is a cornerstone of its identity, the report acknowledges \u2014 making a similar transition \u201cnot as straightforward as it might appear at first glance.\u201d\n\nThe research institute adds: \u201cThe narrative of Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2019s different paths is not just a tale of technological advancements but also reflects different ideologies and priorities of their communities, highlighting the multifaceted complexity inherent in the evolution of leading blockchain networks.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Currently at $2,099 with a 2.9% surge, Ethereum has enthusiasts and investors buzzing about the potential climb to $3,500. What\u2019s driving this upward trend? Let\u2019s explore the intriguing developments shaping Ethereum\u2019s journey.\n\nETH Price\n\nRenowned crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has shared an optimistic outlook for Ethereum, especially in light of recent developments such as Fidelity\u2019s filing. Van de Poppe forecasts a potential climb to $3,500 in the first quarter of 2024, aligning this projection with the upward trajectory witnessed in Bitcoin.\n\n#Ethereum Spot ETF filing by Fidelity!\n\n\n\nConfirms my thesis that after #Bitcoin gets its shine, we\u2019ll see Ethereum running to $3,500 in Q1 2024. \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 30, 2023\n\nRead More: Whales Activated: A Massive Breakout in the Ethereum (ETH) Price is on the Horizon\n\nWhales in Action\n\nA recent surge in Ethereum whale accumulation has caught market attention. On-chain data shows a shift: major exchange wallet holdings dropped to 8.03 million ETH, while non-exchange wallets surged to a record 41.03 million ETH, as reported by Coinpedia News. This shift suggests a growing preference for self-custody among investors, with significant Ethereum amounts moving away from centralized exchanges.\n\nNovember\u2019s Win\n\nIn a surprise move, Ethereum outpaced Bitcoin in price growth in November, surging by 13% compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 8%. A key catalyst was BlackRock\u2019s official filing of a spot ETH ETF. Despite less buzz around ETFs, on-chain data suggests Ethereum\u2019s price volatility now exceeds Bitcoin\u2019s, possibly drawing short-term traders to invest more in ETH than BTC in December.\n\nEthereum Takes the Lead\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock\u2019s recent report, Ethereum\u2019s 30-day Average Intra-Day Volatility score stands at an impressive 0.45%, beating Bitcoin\u2019s 0.32%. This shift in volatility dynamics could reshape investment strategies, drawing more attention to the dynamic opportunities within the Ethereum market.\n\nDespite facing hurdles in November, Ethereum\u2019s price showed a positive pattern known as a Double Bottom on the chart. As we navigate the unpredictable crypto market, the burning question remains: Can Ethereum reach $3,000 by the end of 2023?\n\nAlso Read: Is the SEC Playing Favorites with Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nThe excitement continues as Ethereum\u2019s journey unfolds, and the crypto community eagerly awaits the next chapter in its compelling story."

        "content": "ETH held by addresses for longer than 12 months is at the highest since at least 2018, with the ratio surpassing Bitcoin's for the first time ever.\n\nBy: Camila Russo \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nEthereum staking is minting a record amount of \"hodlers,\" with the ratio of long-term owners surpassing Bitcoin's.\n\nETH held by addresses for longer than 12 months -- or what IntoTheBlock calls the \"Hodler Ratio\"-- is at almost 72% of total ETH holders, the highest since at least October 2018, the data show.\n\nEthereum's \"Hodler Ratio\" crossed Bitcoin's in October, after surpassing it for the first time ever in August.\n\nLong-term investors are important for the health of a Layer 1 chain. So-called \"hodlers\" provide stability and mitigate market volatility as they are less likely to sell in response to short-term market fluctuations.\n\nHodler Ratio\n\nEthereum beating Bitcoin \"hodlers\" comes even as Bitcoin long-term investors increase. The Bitcoin ecosystem is observing the largest disparity on record between its long-term and short-term holders, according to Glassnode.\n\nRead More: Disparity Between Bitcoin HODLers and Daytraders Hits Record\n\nStaking Rewards\n\nEthereum's staking rewards are incentivizing ETH holders to own the chain's native currency for longer and to accumulate more of it.\n\n\"The increase [of long-term holders] is most likely related to the growth in staking this year,\" said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock.\n\nThe amount of ETH staked has nearly doubled in 2023 with about 24% of all supply being staked, Outumuro said. The average duration of funds held there is over one year, so this drives the \"Hodler Ratio\" higher, he said.\n\nDeFi Alpha Premium Content DeFi Daily | Weekdays\n\nDeFi Alpha Letter | Weekly\n\nDefiant Podcast Transcript | Weekly\n\nInbox Dump | Saturday\n\nWeekly Recap | Sunday Looking for Alpha?

The rate is equivalent to the network's \"risk free\" rate, analogous to the yield on a 10-year U.S. Treasury note.\n\nEthereum Whales\n\nEthereum whales are also on the rise, though that number is more nuanced. Addresses owning more than 1% of the circulating ETH supply increased by 12 percentage points this year to 34.6%, according to IntoTheBlock. But the number includes staking contracts, which include many individual holders.\n\nOut of eight Layer 1 chains tracked, only Ethereum and Cardano whales increased this year relative to the rest of holders, while whales in chains including Bitcoin and Avalanche declined."

        "title": "Ethereum price rallies toward key resistance but is ETH's strength sustainable? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) is trading higher on Dec. 1, despite its inability to breach the $2,100 resistance. This level has prompted several rejections in the past three weeks, which is especially concerning given Ether\u2019s 16.2% gains in November.\n\nEther 12-hour price index, USD. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, the current positive momentum is supported by several factors, including applications for spot ETFs and the expansion of Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, driven by layer-2 solutions.\n\nETH benefits from ETF expectations and negative news related to competing blockchains\n\nA pivotal development occurred on Nov. 30, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiating the review process for Fidelity\u2019s spot Ether ETF proposal, filed on Nov. 17. This move, along with similar applications from firms like BlackRock, awaits regulatory green light. If approved, these ETFs would bolster Ether's status as a digital commodity, reducing the likelihood of it being treated as a security.\n\nDespite analysts predicting the SEC might delay its decision to early 2024, interim deadlines for applications by VanEck and ARK 21Shares on Dec. 25 and Dec. 26, respectively, have kept the market engaged. The mounting interest from large mutual funds in Ether products is creating a favorable impact on its price.\n\nThe Ethereum network's growth, especially in transaction activity and layer-2 development, is noteworthy. The Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem has become increasingly important as the average transaction fee held above $4 for the last couple of months. These layer-2 solutions offer more cost-effective and flexible options than the base layer.\n\nThis growth is reflected in Ethereum's total value locked (TVL), which recently hit a two-month high of 13 million ETH, spurred by a 13% weekly gain in Spark and a 60% increase in Blast user deposits.\n\nEthereum network top DApps by TVL. Source: DefiLlama\n\nIn contrast, Tron, another leading blockchain in TVL terms, witnessed a 12% decline over the past ten days. Recent high-profile hacks linked to Tron's founder Justin Sun have also swayed investor confidence toward Ethereum.\n\nTVL growth is based on Ethereum layer-2 innovations\n\nBlast, an Ethereum layer-2 project, has impressively accumulated $647 million in TVL, a testament to the vibrant development within this space. Despite facing criticism over centralization issues and smart contract flexibility, Blast's self-promoted features like auto-compounding and stablecoin yields are attracting significant attention. On the flip side, Blast has suffered criticism for centralization and the flexibility to upgrade its smart contracts.\n\nNotably, Blast is just one part of a larger ecosystem. Ethereum's leading scaling solutions, Arbitrum and Optimism, hold a combined TVL of $2.94 billion. In the context of TVL, it's insightful to compare Ethereum's robust layer-2 ecosystem with other blockchains. Although these solutions are still subject to significant base layer settlement fees, there's no denying the impressive growth and increased activity they've experienced over time.\n\nRelated: Why is the crypto market up today?\n\nTake Solana (SOL) as an example: its entire TVL, encompassing projects like Marinade Finance, Jito, marginfi, Solend, and Orca, is currently valued at $671 million. This stark contrast highlights the edge Ethereum's layer-2 solutions have over its competitors, such as Cardano (ADA), BSC Chain (BNB), and Avalanche (AVAX), blockchains primarily focused on native scaling solutions. However, Ethereum's approach, leveraging layer-2 technologies, seems to have gained more traction and user trust, as evidenced by its growing activity.\n\nIn essence, Ether's recent push towards the $2,100 resistance level is largely influenced by the anticipated approval of spot ETFs in the U.S. and the increased market share in decentralized applications.\n\nThe ongoing evolution and appeal of Ethereum's layer-2 solutions, which mitigate high transaction costs, are also playing a crucial role in attracting users and sustaining Ether's positive market trajectory.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

A trip toward $2,000 would mean a 5% drop for ETH in the short term.\n\nThe largest Ethereum wallets, however, continue to form an encouraging pattern, according to Santiment. The ten largest exchange wallet holdings have reached a six-month low at 8.03 million ETH, while nonexchange wallet holdings have soared to an all-time high at 41.03 million ETH as more coins move to self-custody.\n\nEthereum developers announce important update on Goerli\n\nGoerli, Ethereum's first multiclient testnet, will no longer be supported by client and EF testing teams in the next few months.\n\nThe Dencun network update will be the network's final upgrade. The above-mentioned teams will begin exiting their validators three months after the Goerli Dencun activation or one month after the Dencun mainnet activation, whichever comes later.\n\nUsers of Goerli as a stable testnet should migrate elsewhere before this.\n\nWhile Goerli staking is permissionless, validators from the client and testing teams constitute the vast majority of the stake. As a result, their exits will have an impact on the network's stability.\n\nFurthermore, teams intend to take the opportunity to test delayed finality, inactivity leaks and mass slashings.\n\nSepolia is encouraged to be used by application and tool developers to test decentralized applications, smart contracts and other EVM features.\n\nStakers and infrastructure providers interested in protocol-level testing should use the recently released Holesky testnet. Stakeholders should also consider the Ephemery testnet for validator setup testing. Goerli is currently expected to be the first testnet to activate the Dencun upgrade."

Economic conditions and investor sentiment also play a crucial role. Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Market Cap: ETH\u2019s possibility of surpassing Bitcoin in market capitalization is uncertain, dependent on factors like adoption rates and network upgrades. Bitcoin currently leads with a significantly higher market cap.\n\n\u2018There is Potential for Ethereum\u2019\n\nEthereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2013 Ether (ETH) \u2013 is yet another digital asset that has experienced a rapid price increase since the beginning of 2023. It currently trades at around $2,100 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), with some wondering whether a new all-time high (ATH) could be achieved next year.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, such a development could indeed occur should several vital factors be in place. The AI-powered language model noted market trends and technological advancements as the main ones.\n\nIt outlined Ethereum\u2019s shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS), suggesting other improvements of this type could be bullish for the asset.\n\nChatGPT estimated that positive regulatory developments might encourage institutional investments and thus trigger a rally. On the other hand, stricter rules could have the opposite effect.\n\nGlobal economic conditions, investor sentiment, adoption by mainstream finance, and historical performance are other elements worth observing.\n\nLastly, ChatGPT suggested that the potential rise of different blockchain protocols and cryptocurrencies could impact Ethereum, too.\n\n\u201cGiven these factors, while there is potential for Ethereum to reach new highs, it\u2019s important to approach such predictions with caution and consider the inherent risks and uncertainties of cryptocurrency investments,\u201d the AI language model concluded.\n\nCould ETH Flip BTC: Flippening Possible?\n\nAnother interesting question that has been circulating in the cryptocurrency space for quite some time is whether Ethereum could eventually outpace Bitcoin and become the largest digital asset by market capitalization. On that note, several months ago, we asked ChatGPT if such a scenario is plausible in the next five years.\n\nThe language model explained that this outcome is \u201cuncertain and depends on various factors.\u201d The primary ones are adoption rates and network upgrades. Overall economic condition, inflation, and other financial aspects are also worth considering, ChatGPT assumed.\n\nAs of the moment, Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization stands at over $750 billion, representing a dominance of around 50%. Ethereum is second with a market cap of approximately $250 billion, meaning it has a long way to go before flippening the leader."

        "content": "In a groundbreaking revelation, a recent University of Cambridge study unveils the remarkable environmental turnaround of the Ethereum blockchain. Before a pivotal software upgrade in 2022, the crypto\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions equaled the yearly output of Honduras.\n\nMeanwhile, this transformation signals a positive shift in the cryptocurrency sector\u2019s environmental impact, challenging preconceptions about blockchain\u2019s energy consumption.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum\u2019s Environmental Evolution\n\nThe University of Cambridge study sheds light on the environmental impact of the Ethereum blockchain, revealing that its historical greenhouse gas emissions, pre-major upgrade, matched the yearly emissions of Honduras. Notably, this eye-opening comparison, as reported by Reuters, underscores the crypto sector\u2019s potential for positive change and environmental responsibility.\n\nHowever, in September 2022, the crypto underwent a significant software upgrade known as the \u201cEthereum Merge,\u201d resulting in a staggering 99% reduction in energy usage. Before this transformation, the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions of the second largest crypto by market cap reached 27.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) from its launch in 2015 until the Merge.\n\nIn contrast, under its post-merge system, Ethereum\u2019s annual emissions stand at a mere 2.8 kilotonnes of CO2 equivalent, akin to the environmental impact of five round-trip flights from London to New York, the report suggested.\n\nAnna Lerner, executive director at the Ethereum Climate Platform, emphasizes the role of the crypto as a trailblazer, challenging the perception of blockchain as a high emitter. Lerner emphasizes that Ethereum has demonstrated a dedication to environmental sustainability by avoiding excessive pollution., highlighting the platform\u2019s commitment to environmental safety.\n\nAlso Read: Bitmain\u2019s AntPool Miner Surpasses DCG\u2019s Foundry As The Leading Bitcoin Mining Pool\n\nA Closer Look Into The Report\n\nThe study positions Ethereum\u2019s environmental achievements against Bitcoin, revealing that Bitcoin generates approximately 73.9 MtCO2e annually based on November 2022 data. This places Bitcoin\u2019s yearly emissions on par with Cambodia\u2019s 2020 output, as reported by Climate Watch.\n\nMeanwhile, the comparative analysis showcases Ethereum\u2019s strides in reducing its ecological footprint and sets a precedent for the broader blockchain and cryptocurrency space.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) predominantly function as investment tools, Ethereum\u2019s commitment to reducing emissions provides a blueprint for the industry. As global leaders convene for the COP28 climate summit, Ethereum\u2019s environmental success story challenges the narrative surrounding blockchain\u2019s environmental impact, encouraging further exploration of sustainable practices within the crypto sphere.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Burns 4 Billion Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) Tokens"

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin is best known for creating the world\u2019s second-most-valuable blockchain, Ethereum, when he was just 19 years old. In the past few years, though, Buterin\u2019s influence has expanded well beyond the world of crypto and into the broader realm of ideas where the young polymath\u2014who taught himself Mandarin while traveling the world\u2014offers important treatises on technology and the future.\n\nThe latest example is a 10,000-word essay Buterin published this week titled \u201cMy techno-optimism.\u201d It\u2019s a response to the much-discussed \u201cmanifesto\u201d with a similar title by the influential venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. Buterin\u2019s piece endorses many elements of the manifesto, including an affirmation that technology has delivered marvelous benefits to humanity, and that fear and overzealous regulation have limited progress in fields like biotech. But while he endorses a foot-on-the-gas approach, especially to solve the climate change crisis, Buterin also calls for a more cautious approach when it comes to AI.\n\nWhile the Ethereum creator has long been a leading thinker in computer science, he has also become one in the governance of technology and society. Here is Buterin on the crack-up at OpenAI and the problem of putting guardrails on technology by means of small councils of elite decision-makers:\n\n\u201c[It was] a well-intentioned effort to balance the need to make a profit to satisfy investors who provide the initial capital with the desire to have a check-and-balance to push against moves that risk OpenAI blowing up the world. In practice, however, their recent attempt to fire Sam Altman makes the structure seem like an abject failure: It centralized power in an undemocratic and unaccountable board of five people, who made key decisions based on secret information and refused to give any details on their reasoning until employees threatened to quit en masse.\u201d\n\nDrawing on his experience in trying to build decentralized communities in the Ethereum realm, Buterin provides new and important insights into how to think about AI\u2014including how to avoid the very real possibility that humans end up as pets to machine overlords. He is, of course, hardly the only one with big ideas about the future of technology. But what makes Buterin stand apart is his deep capacity for empathy and lack of ego.\n\nUnlike Andreessen and Balaji Srinivasan\u2014another tech genius whose ideas carry a lot of weight in the debate over technology\u2014Buterin doesn\u2019t have contempt for those who disagree with him, and he doesn\u2019t frame the debate in the shrill us-versus-them tone of the venture capital elite.\n\n\u201cI believe that these [technologies] are deeply good, and that expanding humanity\u2019s reach even further to the planets and stars is deeply good, because I believe humanity is deeply good,\u201d he writes. In a troubled moment where too many people are consumed with fear and negativity, it is welcome to read a tech genius who relies on empathetic persuasion. If you want a shorter and more approachable window into Buterin\u2019s worldview, you can also check out this new Fortune Q&A, which includes the moral case for supporting Ukraine and the fascinating sci-fi realm of the popular book and film The Three Body Problem.

        "content": "The concentration of mempool transactions on Ethereum increased.\n\nETH\u2019s prices continued to surge as whales showed interest.\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of Ethereum transactions, a notable shift has emerged, with approximately 15% of transactions now traversing through private mempools.\n\nInterest in mempools rise\n\nIn simpler terms, a private mempool is like a private club for Ethereum transactions. Instead of everyone seeing a transaction, it\u2019s more exclusive as only a select few get to know about it.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that more and more transactions are choosing this exclusive route, and it\u2019s changing the crypto landscape.\n\nApproximately 50% of these transactions, which exclude any deceptive activities such as trading bots, are currently being routed through these private mempools.\n\nToday, ~15% of Ethereum Txs are landed thru Private Mempools. Cross-checking txs seen by public mempools, we are able to observe the trend of Ethereum txs moving towards private channels over time \u2013 thru metrics across the Tx Settlement Stack on Ethereum. \ud83d\udc40 \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/cQOqunKVMm \u2014 danning.eth\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83e\udd16 (@sui414) November 30, 2023\n\nNow, what does this mean for Ethereum? It\u2019s a bit like a double-edged sword.\n\nOn the positive side, it could mean smoother and more private transactions for regular users. Moreover, all these transactions are protected against sandwiches and front-running in general.\n\nBut, on the flip side, if more transactions go through these private channels, it might make things a bit trickier for keeping an eye on the overall Ethereum network.\n\nSo, while it gives users a more exclusive experience, Ethereum might need to figure out how to balance the secrecy with keeping an eye on the entire network to ensure everything runs smoothly.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nOnly time will tell how ETH will be impacted by this. At press time, ETH was trading at $2,092.58 and had grown by 2.87% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe number of ETH holders also increased during this period. Overall, whale interest in ETH also surged.\n\nThis could help the price move towards green. However, a large concentration of whale holders may make the crypto more centralized.\n\nMoreover, the MVRV ratio for ETH also grew. This implied that ETH holders were largely profitable.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nThis development could affect ETH negatively going forward.\n\nWith more profitable holders, the incentive for them to sell their holdings rises. This could add increased selling pressure on ETH and could result in a correction going forward."

        "content": "The Bitcoin ETF token is not officially affiliated with the spot Bitcoin ETFs currently under review by the United States SEC.\n\nIn a recent episode of the Bankless podcast, analysts David Hoffman and Ryan Adams discussed Solana's (SOL) attributes, such as its speed and low fees, and how these might compare to Ethereum\u2019s (ETH).\n\nWhile both networks have potential, the Bankless experts pointed to SOL\u2019s price performance relative to ETH, suggesting it could be one factor to consider for investors looking to choose between the two.\n\nMeanwhile, some investors are looking towards a brand-new altcoin called Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF) that could outpace Solana and Ethereum in the coming year.\n\nBankless podcast explores Solana\u2019s potential to outpace Ethereum\n\nIn a Bankless episode from November 9, co-hosts David and Ryan explored the recent discourse around Solana versus Ethereum.\n\nWhile David and Ryan discussed various aspects of both blockchains, they highlighted certain features of Solana that might appeal to some investors.\n\nFor example, David notes that Solana has \u201ccaptured a narrative moment\u201d with its recent price run-up and mentions the blockchain has attracted a specific type of developer that Ethereum likely couldn\u2019t.\n\nRyan also observes that Solana occupies a unique design space no other blockchain can fill.\n\nLater, the hosts make reference to Chris Burniske, former head of crypto research at ARK Invest.\n\nBurniske tweeted a price chart for the SOL/ETH trading pair on August 31, showing SOL strength.\n\nAlongside the price chart, Burniske also set a much higher price target for the pair, suggesting that he believes Solana will outperform Ethereum soon.\n\nBurniske\u2019s prediction has come true, with the SOL/ETH pair now sitting at 0.029 ETH \u2013 148% higher than when he posted.\n\nUltimately, the optimistic views of the Bankless hosts and Chris Burniske hint that Solana has a chance at outpacing Ethereum in the weeks ahead.\n\nSOL vs. ETH \u2013 Key differences in the race for supremacy\n\nBuilding off the optimistic sentiment towards Solana\u2019s potential, investors often point to some critical differences between the two networks that set them apart.\n\nSolana prioritizes speed and throughput over anything else, using a unique \u201cproof-of-history\u201d mechanism that enables much faster validation times.\n\nFor example, Solana can currently process over 3,900 transactions per second.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum is far slower, processing 29 transactions per second.\n\nAs such, Solana\u2019s focus on speed attracts developers looking to build high-throughput applications.\n\nHowever, some experts point out that Ethereum's longer history may contribute to its decentralization and security.\n\nEthereum also has a well-established developer ecosystem, with the most developers building out of any blockchain.\n\nBoth blockchains have their merits, but the positive comments from experts like Chris Burniske suggest there\u2019s potential for Solana to overtake Ethereum next year.\n\nNew Bitcoin ETF Token presale looks to benefit from spot BTC ETF buzz\n\nAs Solana and Ethereum battle it out for supremacy, there\u2019s a new project that some speculate could outperform both \u2013 Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF).\n\nStill in its presale phase, Bitcoin ETF Token is an ERC-20 token that aims to capitalize on the buzz around spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the US.\n\nThe project has a deflationary model, with plans to burn 25% of the total supply based on certain ETF adoption milestones.\n\nAccording to the project\u2019s whitepaper, Bitcoin ETF Token also taxes sellers to enhance the total burning amount, adding to the deflationary effects.\n\nAs more supply gets burned, the remaining tokens could grow in value \u2013 assuming demand also increases.\n\nMoreover, with the first spot BTC ETF being close to approval after years of delays, a new Bitcoin ETF Token launch will be right on time.\n\nCrypto influencers like Austin Hilton are already covering the presale, and the project is gathering more attention and gearing up for its market debut.\n\nConsidering the widespread excitement around a spot BTC ETF, there\u2019s a belief the project could benefit from this wave of interest \u2013 positioning it for growth beyond what Solana and Ethereum could see.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s no way of telling whether Bitcoin ETF Token will live up to its hype or produce higher returns than SOL or ETH, the community keeps the optimist high, highlighting that the token can surprise many people if executed correctly."

Some of them have already reached pre-FTX collapse levels. NFTs and meme coin segments might be contributing to this upsurge, data says.\n\nSolana (SOL) exceeds Polygon (MATIC), Optimism (OP) by transactional volume\n\nIn early December 2023, the aggregated on-chain trading volume on the Solana (SOL) blockchain surged above $240 million per day in equivalent. As such, the blockchain managed to surpass both Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP), two mainstream Ethereum-based L2s by this indicator.\n\nImage by DefiLlama\n\nIn the first days of December, Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP) demonstrate trading volumes of $137 million and $40 million per day, respectively. As such, Solana (SOL) processes more money on-chain than they do combined.\n\nAlso, in the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) exceeded its another rival Avalanche (AVAX) by net value locked in dApps. Solana's dApp ecosystem is responsible for $688 million in TVL, Avalanche (AVAX) dApps logged $660 million. At that pace, Solana (SOL) might surpass the TVLs of Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP) in the coming days.\n\nIn the last month, Solana's (SOL) TVL added over 60%, while the SOL price soared by 45%.\n\nHowever, it is still lagging behind Arbitrum (ARB), a dominant Ethereum (ETH) L2. Arbitrum (ARB) amassed almost $2.2 billion in TVL, while its daily trading volume exceeds $363 million in equivalent.\n\nSolScriptions and meme coins triggered Solana (SOL) comeback\n\nThe rally of Solana (SOL) and its network indicators can be attributed to a combination of powerful catalysts. For instance, the interest in Solana-based Ordinals \"SolScriptions\" and meme coins triggered the growth of SPL tokens minted on-chain.\n\nThen, Solana-based liquid staking protocols like Jito and Marinade Finance are actively attracting new customers and liquidity. Decentralized exchanges like Raydium and Orca are also gaining traction.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, CoinEx Research indicated the DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) sector as yet another powerful catalyst for Solana (SOL) ecosystem's rebound."

        "title": "Celestia falls back on Ethereum for data security as TIA jumps - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "The project integrated OP Stack and Arbitrum Nitro to help with data security.\n\nTIA reached a new ATH and its volume increased.\n\nModular consensus and data network Celestia [TIA] has introduced an L2 system called the \u201cEthereum fallback.\u201d Celestia described the Ethereum [ETH] fallback mechanism as one that backs up data availability if there is any downtime on the Celestia mainnet.\n\n2FA for the Celestia camp\n\nAccording to the project, two L2s are involved in the development\u2014 Arbitrum [ARB] and Optimism [OP]. Celestia revealed that its choice of Optimism\u2019s OP Stack was because the blockchain can back up rollup blocks and posts to Ethereum.\n\nIn the case of Arbitrum Nitro, Celestia wants it to engage its advanced calldata compression. This is to ensure that it stores on-chain data if primary data availability fails. Regarding both concepts, Celestia noted that:\n\n\u201cThese two functions work together to ensure that the Ethereum fallback mechanism operates correctly, allowing the rollup to continue functioning even during periods of downtime on Celestia.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this disclosure, AMBCrypto proceeded to assess Celestia\u2019s development activity. At press, the development activity was down to 1.06. This metric tracks the work done in a project\u2019s public GitHub repository.\n\nSo, the decrease means that there has been a lot of activity related to polishing the network.\n\nAs for the TIA price, it reached a new All-Time High (ATH) of $7.35. In a previous article, AMBCrypto discussed TIA as one of the new projects maintaining a good price action.\n\nTIA\u2019s uptrend resumes\n\nBut of late, the token was at the mercy of a 30% slump. As of this writing, the TIA/USD H4 chart has reclaimed its bullish market structure. However, it seems that the uptick was starting to get overheated.\n\nIf so, the price action might retrace from the northward direction. One of the reasons for this assumption is the Relative Strength Index (RSI). At press time, the RSI was 71.75 which is considered overbought.\n\nLike the RSI, the Bollinger Bands (BB) also reinforced the notion that TIA was overbought. This was because the upper band of the BB touched TIA at $7.30. If the lower band had hit the price, TIA would have been tagged oversold.\n\nTherefore, there is a chance for TIA to drop. Also, if the 26-day EMA (orange) becomes at par with the 12-day EMA (blue), the token value may retrace. However, there seems to be support around $6.32. Should the price reverse, it might not go below $6.50 in the short term.\n\nTwo other metrics to look at when analyzing Celestia are social dominance and volume.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s TIA\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nAt the time of writing, TIA\u2019s volume was 188.40 million\u2014 a slight decrease from the 221.80 million peak. This means that there have been many TIA tokens exchanging hands lately.\n\nSo, it was not surprising that the social dominance rose to 1.878%, indicating an increase in discussion around the project."

        "content": "SEI\u2019s price dropped from $0.29 to $0.23 within 24 hours.\n\nThe EVM integration would increase throughput and reduce transaction costs.\n\nUnfortunately for the Sei [SEI] token, the project\u2019s decision to disclose its v2 plans caused havoc for the price action.\n\nPrior to Sei Network\u2019s announcement, the value of SEI surged by double-digits and tapped a new All-Time High (ATH) of $0.29.\n\nBut moments after the revelation, the price fell by 16.86% while trading at $0.23 at press time. This move looked like a typical \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news event.\u201d\n\nThis strategy happens when traders accumulate a token in anticipation of a major development, pushing the price up in return.\n\nHowever, when the development gets to the public domain, the participants involved sell the token for profits.\n\nThe EVM is the \u201cSenSEI\u201d\n\nOn the 29th of November, Sei Network announced via its blog that it would soon become the first parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain.\n\nThe EVM is the computational engine for Ethereum [ETH] that enables smart contract functionality.\n\nSei works using the Cosmos Software Development Kit (SDK) as an open-source framework to construct new blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem. So, the EVM development does not mean that Sie is migrating.\n\nRather, it would be an additional function for the project when it is implemented.\n\nAccording to Sei, the EVM compatibility would enable users to interact with Solana [SOL] and the Ethereum network seamlessly.\n\nThe statement also mentioned that the Sei v2 might lead to an increase in the number of transactions per second. Regarding this, Sei noted that:\n\n\u201cFrom a performance perspective, Sei V2 will offer 28,300 batched transactions per second of throughput, while offering 390 ms block times and 390 ms finality. This allows Sei to support many more users and far more interactive experiences than existing blockchains.\u201d\n\nTVL drops after the disclosure\n\nShould the proposal go live, it could bring about an influx of users on the Sei blockchain. Also, the potential increase in network growth could positively affect the SEI price.\n\nHowever, SEI\u2019s price was not the only figure affected by the recent declaration.\n\nThe Total Value Locked (TVL) also took a hit. At press time, TVL was down to $3.26 million.\n\nThis drawdown was because protocols like SeaSwap and Fuzio experienced a decrease in the liquidity locked in them.\n\nThe decrease in the TVL suggests that market participants doubt that Sie would provide the yield desired if assets are locked in the protocol. But 30 days back, that was not the case.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SEIs worth today?\n\nHowever, there is a chance that the mood sentiment toward the project may change.\n\nOne reason for this assumption is the higher throughput and cheaper transaction costs the network may soon start to offer."

        "content": "There has been a hike in NFT and DeFi activity on Ethereum.\n\nDespite the high demand for ETH, its supply continues to fall.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] network has experienced a surge in activity around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) in recent weeks, on-chain data reveals.\n\nThis growth in network activity follows an extended period of decline when NFT sales volume and DeFi total value locked (TVL) plummeted to new lows.\n\nEthereum\u2019s NFT and DeFi ecosystems\n\nIn November, Ethereum-minted NFTs recorded a sales volume of $348.61 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nAMBCrypto found that this marked the first time since February that the chain would record a month-over-month (MoM) uptick in sales volume.\n\nFor context, Ethereum registered an NFT sales volume of $949.49 million in February. However, as bearish sentiments ravaged the entire crypto market in the first and second quarters of the year, NFT trading activity declined severely.\n\nData from NFTGo showed that general NFT market capitalization peaked at $10 billion on 20th February and has since trended downward.\n\nBetween February and October, NFT sales volume on Ethereum fell by 82%. However, general market sentiments improved in November, leading to a resurgence in NFT trading activity.\n\nLast month, general NFT market capitalization grew by 39%. Mirroring the growth in the general market, Ethereum\u2019s MoM sales volume climbed by 108%.\n\nRegarding its DeFi vertical, it also experienced growth in TVL. Data from DefiLlama showed that between 1st and 30th November, the chain\u2019s TVL rose by 15%.\n\nThe network\u2019s TVL was $26.64 billion at press time, its highest since July.\n\nBut there is a catch\u2026\n\nWhile the growth in NFT and DeFi activity is good for the chain, it might result in a potential hike in ETH\u2019s supply due to the current increased demand for the altcoin.\n\nPseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst Nino found that the resurgence in NFT and DeFi activity on the Ethereum network has led to growth in the standard deviation (SD) of ETH withdrawal transactions from exchanges.\n\nThis means that ETH\u2019s average withdrawal transaction size is becoming more variable. In other words, there are more large and small withdrawal transactions than there used to be.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nTaking a cue from ETH\u2019s historical performance, Nino said:\n\n\u201cLike during past bubble periods, if there\u2019s a surge in demand for DeFi and NFTs, it would necessitate an increased supply of ETH. This could lead to higher volatility in its price.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, despite last month\u2019s NFT and DeFi activity hike, its supply continues to decline. Data from Ultrasound.money showed that 32,012 ETH tokens worth around $66.95 million have been removed from circulation in the last month."

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market anticipates a potential bull market, investors may consider accumulating altcoins in preparation for it.\n\nA notable trend has emerged where altcoins are gaining significant strength, as evidenced by their recent breach of the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) barrier, signaling a more positive investor sentiment toward them.\n\nChart of Altcoins crossing the 50-week SMA barrier. Source CryptoCon\n\nIn the next phase of the market expansion, Solana (SOL) is expected to reach 10% of Ethereum (ETH), according to InvestAnswers, a prominent crypto analyst.\n\nAssuming Ethereum tops $8,000 in the next bull market, the analyst speculates that if Solana reaches 10% of ETH\u2019s market cap, a threshold it has already reached in the past, that would mean a $231 price target for SOL, resulting in a return on investment (ROI) of approximately 278% from the current price of $61.02.\n\nA few days ago, Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem reached a significant milestone, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) hitting a new yearly peak of over $655 million. This marks a substantial increase of 211% since the $210.47 million TVL recorded on January 1.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Solana boasts a remarkable transaction speed of tens of thousands of transactions per second (TPS), far surpassing Ethereum\u2019s 15 TPS. This makes Solana a favorable choice for applications demanding high throughput, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.\n\nSOL reaching a new market cap\n\nIn a more optimistic scenario, InvestAnswers suggests that Solana reaching 20% of Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization is not entirely implausible.\n\n\n\nIf Solana were to achieve this milestone, it would translate to a market capitalization of around $192 billion, according to the expert.\n\nConsidering the potential market cap of $192 billion and token quantities, this would translate into a price of $453 for 1 SOL, resulting in a ROI of around 2,038% from the current price of $61.02.\n\nHypothetical price of SOL. Source: Finbold\n\nInvestAnswers highlights that Solana has already exceeded the 10% threshold in the past.\n\nThe analyst presented a chart depicting SOL\u2019s upside potential, where the yellow line represents 10% of ETH\u2019s market cap, and the blue line represents Solana\u2019s price crossing this threshold in October 2021.\n\nMarket caps of SOL and ETH. Source: InvestAnswers\n\nCathie Wood praises Solana\u2019s speed and efficiency\n\nSolana reached a new year-to-day (YTD) high a day after ARK Invest (NYSEARCA: ARKK) CEO Cathie Wood extolled the network for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nSOL one-month price performance. Source: Finbold\n\nDuring a CNBC interview on November 15, Wood characterized the Solana network as a significant infrastructure player within the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nShe expressed satisfaction with its performance in recent market conditions, stating that Solana has been doing a \u201creally good job.\u201d Drawing a parallel to the historical comparison between Bitcoin and Ethereum, she said:\n\n\u201cEther was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin in the day \u2014 that\u2019s how we got Ether. Solana is even faster and cost-effective than Ether,\u201d Wood said\n\nWood praised Solana for its speed and efficiency compared to the Ethereum network, but predicting the project\u2019s potential remains challenging. Solana is a nascent project, and various factors come into play when determining its future price.\n\nFundamentals: SOL vs ETH\n\nSolana\u2019s innovative proof of history (PoH) consensus mechanism utilizes a verifiable record of past events to achieve network-wide consensus. This approach enables it to complete tens of thousands of transactions per second at a remarkably low fee, making the ecosystem ideal for applications demanding high throughput.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS), known as \u2018The Ethereum Merge,\u2019 marked a significant step in the Ethereum roadmap.\n\nThe Merge has brought down Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by 99.95%, addressing one of the longest-standing issues with PoW-based blockchain systems, but it didn\u2019t address the issues of only 15 TPS and high costs on the network.\n\nSolana Labs Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko believes the Merge has minimal impact on improving Ethereum\u2019s scalability based on the number of transactions and users, he said during an interview with Bloomberg Technology on September 21.\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum Merge doesn\u2019t really improve the scalability of the network. When you look at the number of transactions that Solana (SOL) handles from applications and from users on a daily basis, that\u2019s more than not just Ethereum but all Ethereum-based blockchains combined. So I think Ethereum has a long way to go on scalability,\u201d Yakovenko said\n\nTo address the issues of scalability, Ethereum is going to implement sharding and zk rollups. This approach will significantly reduce the load on the main chain, enabling faster transaction processing and lower fees, but it\u2019s years away, according to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nSome are concert about the Solana ecosystem and question its long-term sustainability and resilience, and while the developer community is growing, it is still far behind Ethereum\u2019s well-established ecosystem of developers and projects.\n\nSolana holds an advantage over Ethereum in terms of transaction speed and scalability, making it an attractive choice for projects with high throughput demands. While Ethereum is working on addressing these limitations, it may take several years to achieve the same level of performance as Solana. This paraphrase might be the main reason SOL will outperform ETH in the next bull market, but the project\u2019s long-term success hinges on its ability to grow and address network stability issues.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Police arrested Cao de Benos at a Madrid train station on Nov. 30.\n\nCao de Benos was released without conditions after appearing before a High Court judge on Dec. 1. Reportedly, an extradition process is pending, though the U.S. must formalize its extradition request and provide documentation.\n\nThe accused insisted that he would not be extradited, writing on X:\n\n\u201cThere is no extradition. The US accusation, in addition to being false, does not exist in Spain \u2026 My thanks to all your messages and to the [Spanish police] for their good treatment and personal support.\u201d\n\nCao de Benos noted that a particular order was given under former U.S. President Donald Trump. Though the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charged Cao de Benos and another individual in April 2022 after Trump\u2019s presidency ended, an FBI poster suggests that charges were underway as early as January.\n\nAccused organized conference and arranged travel\n\nVirgil Griffith traveled to North Korea to participate in a crypto and blockchain conference in April 2019. He was arrested that November. In addition to violating sanctions, U.S. authorities said that Griffith provided information that could help North Korea evade sanctions and engage in money laundering. Griffith was convicted in 2021 and sentenced in 2022; he is currently in prison.\n\nThe DOJ alleges that Cao de Benos, through his own Korean Friendship Association and in cooperation with a U.S. businessman named Christopher Emms, helped organize the blockchain conference that Griffith attended.\n\nFurthermore, Cao de Benos and Emms allegedly recruited Griffith and arranged for him to travel to the country. The DOJ also states that Cao de Benos told Griffith that North Korea would not stamp his passport, thereby concealing Griffith\u2019s travel. After the conference concluded, Cao de Benos and Emms supposedly worked with Griffith on other North Korea-related blockchain efforts.\n\nCao De Benos and Emms have each been charged with one count of conspiring to violate and evade U.S. Sanctions for a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Both are presumed innocent until found guilty."

        "content": "A crypto analyst has singled out an event that could be the spark that Ethereum needs to hit the price level of $3,500. He believes that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is going to make this run after Bitcoin \u201cgets its shine.\u201d\n\nHow Ethereum Will Hit $3,500\n\nIn a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, the CEO and founder of MN Trading, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, alluded to the Ethereum Spot ETF filing by Fidelity in his price prediction of $3,500. The crypto analyst seemed to be suggesting that approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF could propel Ethereum\u2019s price to such heights.\n\nHis reference to Bitcoin also confirms that this might indeed be van de Poppe\u2019s \u201cthesis.\u201d He spoke about Ethereum \u201crunning to $3,500 in Q1 2024\u201d after Bitcoin has had its shine. The \u201cshine\u201d likely refers to the possible approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Some analysts have predicted that there is a 90% chance that a Spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved by January 10, 2024.\n\nWith this in mind, the crypto analyst possibly believes that approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF could come not long after once the Spot Bitcoin ETF is approved. If that happens, it could spark a massive rally in Ethereum\u2019s price. That could explain why Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe is predicting Ethereum to run to $3,500.\n\nSeveral asset managers have already applied with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer an Ethereum Spot ETF. However, all eyes seem to be on the SEC\u2019s decision on the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications. This could simply be because a final decision is expected on the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications, unlike Ethereum\u2019s, which still have a longer review process.\n\nETH price steadies above $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum Spot ETFs May Not Get The Same Reception\n\nHistorically speaking, there is reason to believe that Ethereum Spot ETFs might not enjoy the same reception that Spot Bitcoin ETFs have gotten so far. This is based on the fact that there was a stark comparison in the numbers when the futures ETF of both crypto tokens launched.\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs were already in place as of 2021, with ProShares Bitcoin Strategy (BITO) ETF being the first to launch. Meanwhile, Ethereum futures ETFs just launched this year. What is most interesting is the trading volume that BITO saw on its launch date in comparison to all Ethereum futures ETFs on their launch date.\n\nBITO is reported to have seen more than $1 billion in trading volume in the first two days of launching. On the other hand, the total trading volume for Ether ETFs on their launch day amounted to just under $2 million.\n\nFeatured image from Tron Weekly, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Ethereum is a bellwether for the altcoin market, and today's price action suggests that investors are increasingly confident in the asset's value proposition.\n\nThe technical chart for Ethereum indicates a strong push toward a key resistance level. After a period of consolidation, the price has broken out, suggesting a potential shift from a bearish to a bullish trend at around $2,100. This move aligns with a broader market recovery.\n\nAnalyzing the chart, Ethereum has been tracing an ascending trajectory, supported by a rising trendline that underscores a series of higher lows \u2013 a classic indicator of bullish sentiment. The 50-day moving average, which is often looked upon for trend confirmation, is positioned below the current price, serving as a dynamic support level. The price is pushing toward the $2,100 level, which has historically acted as a significant resistance zone.\n\nA breakthrough above this resistance could signal the start of a new uptrend, potentially challenging previous highs. However, traders will be watching closely for sustained volume to accompany this price increase, as higher trade volumes would lend credence to the breakout and suggest stronger conviction among buyers.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator, is currently hovering in the upper neutral zone, nearing overbought territory. While this could indicate that a pause or pullback is due, it also reflects the strong buying pressure that has driven the recent price increase.\n\nDogecoin not joking\n\nAt the time of writing, Dogecoin's price hovers around $0.38, which has established itself as a significant resistance point. This level has been tested multiple times over recent weeks, with each attempt bringing increased selling pressure. However, the persistence of DOGE bulls is noteworthy, as they continue to push the price back up to this threshold, indicating a potential accumulation phase preceding a breakout.\n\nThe technical indicators on the chart reinforce this narrative. The moving averages are aligned in a bullish formation, with the 50-day moving average serving as dynamic support below the current price. This could embolden the bulls, offering a psychological boost as they rally to break past the current resistance.\n\nFurthermore, the formation of a small symmetrical triangle suggests that volatility may be on the horizon for Dogecoin. This pattern, characterized by converging trend lines, points to a period of consolidation that typically precedes significant price movement. Given the positioning of the price at the upper end of the triangle, there is an argument to be made for an impending bullish breakout.\n\nExamining the volume, we see a consistency that accompanies the consolidation pattern, hinting that a breakout could be accompanied by a substantial increase in trade volume. This would provide the necessary market confirmation for a genuine breakthrough, rather than a false breakout that could trap overzealous bulls.\n\nADA's consolidation continues\n\nThe Cardano (ADA) market has entered a phase of consolidation, marked by a confluence of technical indicators that suggest brewing momentum. With the price oscillating around $0.38, the question on many investors' minds is whether this is the quiet before the storm of a significant breakout.\n\nA close examination of the daily chart reveals diverging moving averages, with the 50-day moving average trending upward, suggesting a bullish undercurrent, while the 200-day moving average is moving lower, indicating potential longer-term bearish sentiment. This divergence can often signal a period of market indecision, with shorter-term bullish sentiment wrestling against longer-term caution.\n\nThe immediate resistance level for ADA sits at around $0.40, a threshold that has capped upward price movements in recent times. For a confirmed breakout, ADA bulls need to push and sustain the price above this level, ideally with an increase in volume to signify strong market conviction."

        "content": "In a significant move for the cryptocurrency market, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened the floor for public comments on a proposed rule change. This change could allow Fidelity Investments, a major asset management firm, to offer shares of its spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF). This proposal marks a pivotal moment in integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial products.\n\nSEC Reviews Fidelity Ethereum ETF Proposal\n\nThe SEC\u2019s November 30 announcement invites \u201cinterested persons\u201d to share their views on Fidelity\u2019s proposal. This follows Fidelity\u2019s November 17 application for the ETF, which seeks to list and trade shares of its Fidelity Ethereum Fund on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The move by Fidelity is part of a broader trend among asset management firms aiming to launch spot crypto ETFs in the U.S.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision to solicit public feedback represents a key step in the regulatory process. It reflects the growing interest and potential regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrencies as mainstream financial assets. Public members have a 21-day window to submit their comments, starting from the date of publication in the Federal Register.\n\nSpot ETH ETF Could Protect Investors\n\nFidelity\u2019s filing highlights the gap in the U.S. market for regulated, exchange-traded crypto products. While investors in countries like Germany, Switzerland, and France can access Ether through exchange-traded products, the U.S. market has lagged in offering similar opportunities. According to Fidelity, the lack of a U.S.-regulated, exchange-traded Ether product leaves U.S. investors with limited and riskier options for gaining exposure to Ethereum.\n\nThe filing emphasizes the potential benefits of a spot ETH ETF for U.S. investors, particularly in risk management. Approval of such a product could mark a major advancement in protecting U.S. investors in the crypto asset space.\n\nThe SEC has been cautious in approving spot cryptocurrency ETFs for the U.S. market. Although the commission has greenlit ETFs tied to Bitcoin futures and, more recently, Ether futures, it has yet to approve a spot crypto ETF. Approval of Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum ETF represents a significant development in the cryptocurrency sector, potentially paving the way for broader acceptance and integration of crypto assets in mainstream finance.\n\nRead Also: Ethereum Discussions Spikes Amidst Spot ETF Filings, Is ETH Price Aiming Bulls?"

        "content": "Sara is steadily working on cryptocurrency evaluations, news, and fluctuations in digital currency prices. She is guest author associated with many cryptocurrencies admin and contributes as an active guide to readers about recent updates on virtual currencies.\n\nOver the past decade, Ethereum has established itself as the leading blockchain platform, revolutionizing the world with its bright concept of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. However, as the blockchain industry continues to evolve, new and innovative ecosystems are emerging, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance. In this article, we will explore the rise of these alternative blockchain ecosystems and shed light on the Ultima ecosystem, which stands out as a prime example of innovation and potential.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strengths and Limitations\n\nThere\u2019s no denying Ethereum\u2019s groundbreaking contributions to the blockchain industry. With its robust smart contract capabilities, Ethereum has enabled the creation of a vast ecosystem of dApps and DeFi protocols. However, Ethereum has faced significant challenges, particularly in terms of scalability and high gas fees. As the demand for dApps and DeFi projects grew, Ethereum\u2019s network congestion became apparent, leading to slower transaction times and exorbitant fees.\n\nThese limitations have impacted the user experience and hindered the scalability of the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, the switch to staking, while promising in theory, has raised questions about whether it has truly lived up to users\u2019 expectations and the actual rewards it offers.\n\nThe Emergence of New Blockchains\n\nAs Ethereum grapples with its limitations, alternative blockchains have emerged, aiming to provide solutions and compete for market share. Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Polkadot are a few examples of these rising stars challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance and aiming to provide solutions to the scalability and cost issues.\n\nHowever, among these alternatives, the Ultima ecosystem has garnered attention for its unique offerings and outstanding features. Ultima is building a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain products and introduces the DeFi-U platform, which aims to revolutionize decentralized finance and provide users with a seamless and efficient experience.\n\nUltima: The Innovative Blockchain Ecosystem\n\nAt the heart of the Ultima ecosystem lies a commitment to innovation and cutting-edge technology. Compared to Ethereum, Ultima boasts faster transaction processing of the Smart Blockchain it is built on, setting new parameters for speed and efficiency. Additionally, the ecosystem offers lower transaction costs, making it more cost-effective for users to engage in various activities.\n\nULTIMA, the native token of the Ultima ecosystem, implements a halving mechanism to increase its scarcity and value. This strategy reduces the rate of new tokens entering the market by half every 10,000,000 blocks, ensuring a controlled supply and preventing inflation. Currently, slightly over 50 ULTIMA tokens are coming off the block daily. In 2024, this number will decrease to 25, and by 2028, the daily supply will reach just 1 token, introducing scarcity and potentially driving up the token\u2019s value over time.\n\nThis scarcity-focused approach encourages early adoption and creates a sense of urgency for participants to engage with the platform and acquire ULTIMA tokens. Early adopters and long-term holders of ULTIMA tokens can benefit from potential price appreciation and access to ecosystem advantages. Ultima has plans to expand the ecosystem with future products such as a crowdfunding platform, marketplace, cryptocurrency debit card, UltimEx cryptocurrency exchange, and Ultima Travel Club. These additions aim to make the Ultima ecosystem comprehensive for its user base, which already exceeds 3 million users worldwide.\n\nUltima\u2019s flagship product, DeFi-U, is a delegated liquidity pool that allows users to activate profit in ULTIMA tokens. The splitting mechanics of rewards distribution offers split licenses for lifelong benefits in ULTIMA tokens through blockchain technology and smart contracts, allowing both experienced and new users to engage directly with blockchain technology. Unlike Ethereum\u2019s complex staking process, splitting simplifies participation, attracting a wider user base and promoting active ecosystem engagement.\n\nWhat\u2019s Wrong with Staking?\n\nEthereum, which initially operated on a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism similar to Bitcoin, has since transitioned to a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism following the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, also known as the \u201cMerge.\u201d This update has been eagerly awaited and discussed for a long time because it raised a lot of hopes.\n\nHowever, as time went on, there occurred some challenges associated with staking. One of the main reasons why the tech hasn\u2019t become massively adopted was its complexity, for staking requires users to lock their tokens directly on the blockchain with operators or validators.\n\nStaking tokens can be risky due to factors like slashing and penalties, client software bugs, and unstaking periods. Trustworthiness is crucial when choosing a validator, and different teams should be used to maintain the software. The bear market has negatively impacted public perception of staking, making it essential to choose trustworthy and reliable validators.\n\nWhy Splitting Is Better Than Staking\n\nThe splitting technology offered by Ultima presents several advantages over traditional staking mechanisms, which may make it more appealing to both experienced cryptocurrency enthusiasts and newcomers. Here\u2019s a detailed comparison of why splitting could be considered better than staking:\n\nAccessibility and Ease of Use: Traditional staking often requires a certain level of technical knowledge and understanding of blockchain technology. Ultima\u2019s splitting tech is more appealing to both experienced and newcomers. It simplifies the process by allowing users to acquire SPLIT tokens via a license and smart contract, making it more accessible to the average person without technical expertise.\n\nLiquidity Concerns: Staked tokens are often locked up for a certain period, reducing liquidity and limiting users\u2019 ability to respond to market movements. With splitting, daily rewards in ULTIMA tokens are claimable after 24 hours, offering more flexibility and potentially higher liquidity.\n\nPrice Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Staking rewards are typically in the form of the native token, whose value can fluctuate widely. In the case of splitting, the combination of a halving mechanism with a limited supply of ULTIMA tokens is designed to potentially increase token value over time, which could offer a more stable reward system.\n\nLongevity of Rewards: With splitting, users receive daily rewards for the rest of their lives as long as they hold SPLIT tokens in their Smart Wallets. This model provides a clear, long-term benefit structure, whereas staking rewards may vary based on changes in protocol rules or tokenomics.\n\nCommunity Growth and Token Scarcity: The Ultima ecosystem is designed to grow with its community, and as more people use ULTIMA tokens, the market supply decreases due to the halving mechanism and limited token supply. This could potentially drive up prices and make rewards more valuable over time, benefiting early adopters and consistent participants.\n\nExpanding Horizons: Shaping the DeFi Landscape\n\nAs the blockchain space continues to mature, new ecosystems are emerging, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance and offering innovative features and solutions. The rise of innovative blockchain ecosystems, such as Ultima, showcases the potential beyond Ethereum. With its cutting-edge technology, user-centric approach, and unique advantages, Ultima is poised to shape the future of decentralized finance, providing users with a more accessible, secure, and efficient DeFi experience. As the blockchain landscape continues to evolve, embracing these innovative ecosystems will unlock new opportunities and possibilities for individuals and the broader blockchain community."

Despite the permissionless nature of Goerli staking, the departure of validators from client and testing teams, who constitute a significant stake majority, poses potential stability challenges. Concurrently, teams plan to leverage this transition to test delayed finality, inactivity leaks, and mass-slashings.\n\nWhile Goerli is likely to be the first testnet to activate the Dencun upgrade, the Ethereum team will announce the specific date very soon.\n\nGoerli, embodying the collaborative ethos of the Ethereum community, was initiated and maintained by a diverse group of individuals solving technical challenges and inadvertently building a thriving community.\n\nWhat Shall Developers and Stakers Do?\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation encourages developers to turn to Sepolia for testing decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) functionalities. Sepolia\u2019s permissioned validator set ensures a stable testing environment. Alternatively, various local development environments facilitate testing against Ethereum mainnet state copies.\n\nStakers and infrastructure providers with a focus on protocol-level testing can further explore the recently launched Holesky testnet, where anyone can run a validator. For validator setup testing, the Ephemery testnet offers a weekly reset feature, enabling lightweight end-to-end testing of the validator lifecycle.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain network has come a long way through several upgrades over the years. The forthcoming series of ETH upgrades will primarily focus on enhancing scalability.\n\nDanksharding stands out as the imminent significant Ethereum upgrade, leveraging distributed data sampling to augment the scalability of the Ethereum network. This advancement is crucial for boosting scalability and concurrently fostering decentralization by effectively managing extensive datasets generated by layer2 rollups.\n\nThe initial phase, known as Proto-danksharding or EIP-4844, will precede the complete implementation of danksharding. Additionally, Proto-danksharding introduces temporary data blobs, ensuring their seamless transmission. The comprehensive integration of danksharding is anticipated to be finalized by early 2024.\n\nAt press time, the ETH price is trading 3% up closer to $2,100 as the SEC considers reviewing Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF."

Intriguingly, the altcoin\u2019s market cap is holding up above $245 billion, according to market data by CoinMarketCap.\n\nThis has been a week of consolidation with Ethereum price sitting above the $2,000 level. Recovery has become an uphill battle leaving Ether to wobble between support at $2,020 and a short-term resistance at $2,070.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: How Far Is Ethereum From Breakout?\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator upholds the mundane sideways trading Ethereum has displayed since Monday. Its downside is protected by the 100 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (blue) at $2,020 and the ascending trendline.\n\nEthereum price tends to react bullishly every time it has retraced to touch the trendline. Therefore, in case of dips towards the $2,000 mark, bulls could seize the opportunity to buy into ETH while speculating on the next breakout first to $2,200, and later to the subsequent levels at $2,500 and $3,000.\n\nTraders should exercise caution and restraint as long as Ethereum is trading below the short-term resistance at $2,040, as highlighted by the 50 EMA (red). The action above this level and the next resistance between $2,058 and $2,070 would serve as a breakout signal, paving the way for a bigger move to $2,200.\n\nThe momentum indicator will confirm the uptrend\u2019s continuation with the blue MACD line flipping above the red signal line.\n\nA triangle pattern forming on the four-hour chart could nurture a bigger breakout towards $3,000 if validated. Bulls must focus on breaking above resistance at $2,120 to activate the triangle breakout. Most traders would consider going long on Ethereum slightly above the triangle.\n\nRecommended for you: Dogecoin Price Could Blast Through $0.12 Resistance If This Technical Pattern Plays Out\n\nA glimpse of the daily chart assures traders of support at $2,015 but based on the current technical, as depicted by the sell signal from the MACD, ETH might drop again before making another significant recovery attempt.\n\nHowever, backing the bullish outlook in ETH is the position of all three moving averages; the 50-day EMA, the 100-day EMA, and the 200-day EMA. If the MAs uphold the ongoing uptrend, the path with the least resistance is likely to stick to the upside.\n\nEthereum DeFi TVL Shoots To $26 Billion\n\nThe dollar value of all ETH locked in staking protocols and other decentralized finance (DeFi) networks is increasing rapidly. According to data by Defi Llama, the total value locked (TVL) currently stands at $26 billion from approximately $19.4 billion in mid-October.\n\nThe growth in TVL underscores the long-term bullish outlook investors have for Ethereum price. They are willing to lock up their Ether for longer periods, expecting that the uptrend will continue into 2023. A high TVL value significantly reduces the selling pressure.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "title": "The Rise Of DAOs: Transforming Governance Through Ethereum's Decentralized Autonomous Organizations - Dataconomy",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, one phenomenon has been gaining substantial momentum\u2014Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). At the forefront of this revolution is Ethereum, a blockchain platform that has become the breeding ground for innovative and decentralized governance structures.\n\nDespite the Ethereum price fluctuations, the blockchain itself is so impactful as it is the most preferred for building DAOs. Organizations\u2019 operations have been transformed by this smart contract, which represents a paradigm shift. It is so loved because it allows for trustless, transparent and community-driven decision-making processes.\n\nUnderstanding DAOs\n\nA Decentralized Autonomous Organization is, at its core, a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain programmed to execute specific rules and decisions without the need for a central authority. Unlike traditional organizations with hierarchical structures, DAOs are governed by code and the consensus of their members, often referred to as token holders.\n\nThe functionality of DAOs extends across a spectrum of applications, from investment funds to art curation and decentralized applications (DApps) development. One notable example is \u201cThe DAO,\u201d a crowdfunding project launched in 2016 on the Ethereum blockchain. While it faced a notorious security breach, the incident prompted the Ethereum community to learn, adapt and evolve the concept of DAOs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s programmability through smart contracts provides the ideal playground for DAOs to flourish. These contracts encode the rules and conditions under which a DAO operates, including voting mechanisms, fund allocation and proposal execution. Ethereum\u2019s robust and secure infrastructure ensures the integrity of DAO operations, fostering trust among participants.\n\nToken governance and decision-making\n\nAt the heart of DAOs is the concept of token governance. Token holders who possess a stake in the DAO through cryptocurrency tokens are granted voting rights proportional to their holdings. This ensures that those with a larger investment have a greater say in the decision-making process, aligning incentives and encouraging active participation.\n\nThe decision-making process within DAOs typically involves proposing and voting on initiatives. Proposals can range from fund allocation for a specific project to changes in the DAO\u2019s operational rules. Each token holder can cast their vote, and the outcome is determined by a majority or a predefined threshold, depending on the DAO\u2019s rules.\n\nChallenges and the road ahead\n\nWhile the rise of DAOs signals a transformative era in decentralized governance, challenges remain. Security vulnerabilities, legal uncertainties and the need for effective dispute-resolution mechanisms pose ongoing considerations for DAO developers and participants. Learning from past incidents, the Ethereum community is actively working on addressing these challenges to fortify the foundation for widespread DAO adoption.\n\nIn the future, DAOs are poised to extend their reach beyond the crypto community. Their potential applications in various industries, including finance, governance and even charitable initiatives, hold promise for reshaping traditional organizational structures.\n\nFeatured image credit: Bastian Riccardi/Unsplash"

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) is showing strong moves with its price regaining $2,1000 levels once again. The bullishness comes as the US SEC opens up discussions for the spot Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nAt press time, ETH price is trading 2.9% up at a price of $2,099 with a market cap of $252 billion.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Can Rally to $3,500\n\nCrypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has expressed his bullishness for Ethereum over the Fidelity filing. In light of this filing, he asserts his belief that following Bitcoin\u2019s surge, Ethereum is poised to reach $3,500 in the first quarter of 2024. As reported by CoinGape, Ethereum also holds the probability to hit a new all-time high in 2024.\n\nAs reported last week, the Ethereum whale accumulation has been going on pretty strongly. Additionally, on-chain data shows the major exchange of wallet holdings. According to Santiment, the largest Ethereum wallets are exhibiting a positive pattern, indicating a significant shift.\n\nExchange wallets have dropped to their lowest in the past six months, standing at 8.03 million ETH, while non-exchange wallets have surged to an all-time high of 41.03 million ETH. This trend suggests a growing preference for self-custody, as more coins are transitioning away from exchanges.\n\nETH Price Volatility and Action Ahead\n\nIn November, ETH\u2019s price surged by 13%, outpacing Bitcoin\u2019s 8%. A significant factor contributing to Ethereum\u2019s growth was Blackrock\u2019s official filing for a spot ETH ETF (Ethereum-based Exchange Traded Fund).\n\nNevertheless, with the diminishing media hype around ETFs, on-chain data reveals that Ethereum\u2019s price volatility has surpassed that of Bitcoin. This trend might entice swing traders and short-term day traders to allocate more investments in ETH than BTC in December as well.\n\nAs per IntoTheBlock, ETH\u2019s 30-day Average Intra-Day Volatility has currently exceeded that of Bitcoin. The provided chart illustrates Ethereum\u2019s Average Volatility score at 0.45%, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s score of 0.32%.\n\nDuring a significant portion of November, the Ethereum price experienced lateral movement, oscillating between $2133 and $1917. Repeated testing of these horizontal levels twice each indicated a sense of uncertainty among market participants.\n\nDuring the recent two weeks of consolidation, the Ethereum price faced two setbacks from the $2133 resistance, revealing considerable overhead supply. These reversals have underscored the formation of a bullish reversal pattern recognized as a Double Bottom on the daily timeframe chart. The question remains whether the ETH price will hit $3,000 before the end of 2023."

        "content": "Research from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) and the Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) reveals that the Merge \u2013 the upgrade that switched the ETH consensus mechanism from a proof-of-work protocol to a proof-of-stake system \u2013 ensured that Ethereum now has a much lighter greenhouse gas footprint than other high carbon-emitting blockchains.\n\nThis research, announced at COP28 at two events, reveal that Ethereum has historically created 27.5 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (MtCO2e), highlighting the impact of crypto asset technology on sustainability and how technology can be used to help countries access funding for their Nationally Determined Contributions.\n\nA nationally determined contribution (NDC) or intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) is a non-binding national plan highlighting climate change mitigation, including climate-related targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions.\n\nThe ECP, founded by Allinfra and Consensys, also recently welcomed Earthshot prize winner Boomitra as a new partner committed to mitigating one million tonnes of CO\u2082, which was a first step in addressing the historical carbon footprint of Ethereum. Over the next few years, the ECP will be facilitating investment to address this historical footprint and leveraging its digital toolset and vast network of carbon market experts and corporations.\n\nAnna Lerner, executive director of the ECP said: \u201cThis trailblazing research gives us all a wake-up call when it comes to demonstrating how to decarbonise a vastly impactful technology - and how we can put it to work for climate finance. We started the ECP to counteract the historical emissions of Ethereum and now, we have a valid, specific quantitative figure to work with. We call on every business using blockchain to take accountability, commit to using more sustainable methods, and redress the carbon emissions that they have created.\u201d\n\nBill Kentrup, co-founder and head of origination at Allinfra, added: \u201cThese findings mark a significant step forward and allow us to comprehend the magnitude of positive impact achieved through the near-complete decarbonisation of the Ethereum ecosystem. It is a source of inspiration for both the team here at Allinfra and the ECP where we are working to engage in climate mitigation together. We implore others in the global technology and business community to join the fight against the climate crisis by incentivising the financing of real-world, verifiably green projects.\u201d\n\nSteven Haft, head of global partnerships and climate lead, Consensys, continued: \u201cEthereum is the second biggest blockchain in the world by far; Proof of Stake Ethereum, \u2018greened Eth\u2019 and Web3 technology present an irresistible combination for attracting investible climate projects. This is why the Ethereum Climate Platform was formed and is committed to addressing the historical carbon footprint of Ethereum. We welcome the research and will use its peer-reviewed findings as the base of our carbon pledge.\u201d"

        "content": "The Buterin Cards NFT collection triggered a 13% gas fee increase on the Ethereum (ETH) network. In the past 24 hours, transactions linked to the collection resulted in fees totaling 318.31 ETH, equivalent to $665,670.\n\nButerin-themed NFTs\n\nAs of 3:00 p.m. ET on Dec. 1, transactions linked to a new non-fungible token (NFT) project known as Buterin Cards reportedly accounted for over 13% of the total Ethereum network gas fees within three hours, surpassing fees from the Uniswap universal router address and Tether\u2019s public address, according to Etherscan data.\n\nThe surge in fees was a consequence of heightened demand for processing transactions associated with the Buterin Cards NFT collection.\n\nThe Buterin Cards project seeks to release 2,015 NFTs as a tribute to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain. Utilizing a unique NFT minting process called JPEG mining, the project distinguishes itself by storing image data on-chain, deviating from conventional NFTs that only store metadata on-chain.\n\nTo ensure the integrity of the uploaded data and prevent arbitrary uploads, the smart contract verifies data correctness by computing its hash. The project\u2019s website explains that thanks to progressive JPEG technology, the NFT image gradually unveils as it undergoes the mining process.\n\nIn exchange for their contributions, miners are rewarded with a card featuring an image of Vitalik Buterin at various quality levels, according to the project\u2019s website.\n\nYou might also like: early investors of Ethereum and Cardano considering new crypto project\n\nThe Ethereum evolution\n\nIn recent times, Ethereum has undergone significant developments, most notably the shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, known as Ethereum 2.0. This transition replaced the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model, introducing staking, where validators stake 32 Ether (~$50,000) and are randomly selected to add blocks. This change has led to a remarkable 99.9% reduction in Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption.\n\nThe broader Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, consisting of phases like the Beacon Chain, the Merge, and Shard Chains, aims to enhance scalability and security. These adjustments address Ethereum\u2019s limitations, including scalability and energy consumption.\n\nIn terms of market performance, Ethereum\u2019s price has rebounded, surpassing the $2,000 level and approaching new 52-week highs, reflecting a robust 2023 performance.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum gas fees have experienced fluctuations, reaching their lowest levels since November 2022.\n\nThe decrease in gas fees has been attributed to a reduction in on-network activity, resulting in more manageable fees for Ethereum users. Factors influencing these changes include network congestion, Ethereum upgrades, and market speculation.\n\nHowever, the primary goal has been to enhance scalability and decrease fees. Even though the immediate effects of these upgrades may not be evident, they have also contributed to the fluctuations in gas fees.\n\nRead more: Forbes forks release of 30 under 30 to Ethereum blockchain\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Airdrops from Blur, Arbitrum and Optimism are among the biggest the industry has seen in recent times.\n\nWhile the Starknet airdrops frenzy is relatively new to the broader community, the most anticipated for now is that of XRP Ledger (XRPL)-based L2, Evernode (EVERS). Per recent statistics shared by the protocol earlier today, there are lots of community members vying to get their own share of EVERS as the protocol sets a legacy as one of the pioneering L2 protocols on XRPL."

        "content": "Fri 01 Dec 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nAs Solana, the \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d is reborn after a tumultuous period, its spectacular progress against its historic rival reignites the debate: are we witnessing the beginnings of a paradigm shift in the crypto universe?\n\nSolana, the crypto tsunami sweeping towards Ethereum\n\nSolana (SOL) has recorded gains surpassing other major cryptocurrencies with a price increase of 7% on Wednesday morning. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $60.16 each, representing a 24-hour rise of more than 7% (CoinGecko). Over 7 days, SOL has gained 10%.\n\nThis trend shows a resurgence for the Solana outsider. After a challenging year in 2022, marked by repeated outages and the FTX affair, the decentralized network seems to be attracting investors once again.\n\nSOL has had a phenomenal rally in November. The price of Ethereum\u2019s competitor surpassed $50 for the first time since May 2022, outperforming most cryptos in terms of performance. According to experts, this surge is due to a squeeze caused by the exit of short sellers and renewed institutional interest.\n\nHowever, a month later, Solana continues to rise. In the last 30 days, SOL has increased by more than 70%. Otherwise, the crypto market is relatively stagnant. Bitcoin and Ethereum have barely moved over 24 hours. The same goes for Dogecoin, Tron, and XRP. Only Avalanche (AVAX) is performing as well as SOL over 24 hours, at $20.87 (+80% in a month).\n\nRaoul Pal compares Ethereum and Solana\n\nThe famous crypto trader and investor, Raoul Pal, has recently provided a unique perspective on the comparison between Ethereum and Solana. He notes that the use of Solana is distinguished by a smoother, faster, and more user-friendly experience.\n\nRenowned for his sharp analyses based on the blockchain, his comments comparing the two networks on purely fundamental grounds are exceptional. In his detailed study, he likens Ethereum to Android, praising the vastness of its decentralized ecosystem, while Solana resembles Apple in its focus on user comfort.\n\nHis words summarize his opinion well: \u201cOnce in the Solana ecosystem, everything seems ultra-fast, smooth, engaging, and easy for the user. The best analogy is that SOL is Apple where ETH is Android. Both are winners. Huge.\u201d\n\nIn this novel analysis, Raoul Pal highlights Solana\u2019s ability to compete with Ethereum, and that\u2019s on almost all fronts. He especially praises the excellence of its Phantom wallet, highly prized by SOL holders.\n\nThe skeptical view: Ethereum remains the undisputed leader\n\nAlthough Solana wins on certain points, it is still far from rivalling Ethereum. Indeed, while it impresses with its technical performance, it cannot yet equal the richness of the Ethereum ecosystem nor its dominance in the dApp sector.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum also boasts a crucial advantage: its credibility and reputation solidly established over the years in the crypto industry. Therefore, despite high fees and scalability limitations, it remains the reference point for institutional players.\n\nWill Solana ever manage to dethrone Ethereum? If it continues on its current trajectory, it\u2019s not impossible. However, the path is still long for this contender to the throne, which must above all consolidate investors\u2019 trust in the long term.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

Meanwhile, it is also integrating with Crossmint, which builds tools that make it easier for businesses to build NFTs at scale.\n\nMetaverse skeptics could criticize moves like this, given the tech\u2019s downturn as a cultural phenomenon. But blockchain evangelists beg to differ, and corporate America as well as global brands seem to agree. Not only have fashion brands continued to invest in virtual technology and metaverse initiatives, but Crossmint \u2014 a popular NFT partner for some of the world\u2019s most recognizable companies \u2014 recently inked another notable deal with Coinbase.\n\nThe original \u201cCopyCopyCopy\u201d look from the 2018 collection.

He used Crossmint, which can work with fiat currency, as the NFT payment processor.\n\n\u201cCrossmint is the perfect partner to really remove the friction between payments and experience that you get with NFTs,\u201d said Marchesi. \u201cThat\u2019s the name of the company itself, \u2018Crossmint,\u2019 so they really don\u2019t care anymore what currency you\u2019re using at other servers. And that\u2019s what we need for our community, for our users.\u201d\n\nWith the Ethereum play, The Fabricant\u2019s digital fashions \u2014 its own or those of its brand partners \u2014 are poised to become more available to a greater number of consumers.\n\nLinking to Ethereum is something of a homecoming for the company. \u201cWe sold the world\u2019s first digital fashion couture NFT on Ethereum, back in 2019,\u201d explained Murphy, referring to a high-profile collaboration between The Fabricant and artist Johanna Jaskowska, CryptoKitties and Dapper Labs that resulted in a digital blockchain dress called \u201cIridescence.\u201d The NFT was hailed as the world\u2019s first virtual-only haute couture dress and sold for close to $10,000.\n\nThe project was more about making a statement about digital fashion, said the CEO, and at the time, it prompted the press to wonder why anybody would pay such a high price for clothing that didn\u2019t actually exist. But soon enough, COVID-19 changed the equation, with people living more of their lives online amid widespread lockdowns. \u201cWe became one of the most relevant companies in the fashion industry, and we had all the physical fashion brands calling us up asking, \u2018What is this digital fashion about?\u2019\u201d he added.\n\nAs he reflected on his company\u2019s five-year journey, it\u2019s clear that it was quite a whirlwind studded with major figures in gaming, from establishment giant Atari to Web3 hit Star Atlas, and notable names in fashion spanning Rtfkt, the digital sneaker start-up-turned-Nike business, to Virgil Abloh. The Fabricant has been at the heart of millions of dollars in NFT transactions and other investments and not just for partners. In 2021, it scored $14 million in series A funding, which was perhaps fortunate timing. The following year saw a cryptomarket crash that took the shine off of cryptocurrencies and, to some degree, NFTs.\n\nMurphy was quick to note that The Fabricant is not a crypto company, but it does work with the same underlying blockchain technology, so it felt the ripples. \u201c[We] had to really detach ourselves from the narrative of crypto NFT and metaverse, and really focus on digital fashion,\u201d he said, describing it as a highly successful shift.\n\nNow the company is ready to move forward and, once again, timing may be on its side, given recent advancements in artificial intelligence, brands\u2019 growing digital sophistication and greater consumer understanding of virtual experiences. Case in point: The revamped version of Amber Jae Slooten\u2019s Deep collection, as reimagined using generative AI. The original was never available \u201con chain\u201d before, but the collection totaling seven items will drop on Dec. 14 as part of The Fabricant\u2019s Ethereum expansion.\n\n\u201cMachine\u201d from the 2018 Deep collection. Courtesy image\n\n\u201cMachine\u201d as reimagined by AI in the 2023 Deep collection. Courtesy image\n\nAs for the future, Marchesi pointed to new experiences in development, such as augmented reality dressing. It remains a holy grail in digital fashion, and The Fabricant partnered with Snap Inc. to enable it and, by doing so, it joined myriad players from Google to DressX pursuing the same thing. The key is to not let the technology or complexity get in the way. The CTO sees it as \u201cpart of our vision, [which] is about, everyone should be able to wear digital fashion in any context with any device.\u201d The Fabricant quietly launched AR try-on as a beta feature of its platform, as it has been a work in progress, but it\u2019s ready to call more attention to it now.\n\nAnother area of interest is using virtual fashion and realistic AI models for photo shoots. The company wouldn\u2019t disclose details on that on the record, but it is actively exploring this.\n\nThere\u2019s more happening on the fashion front, including some sort of upcoming collaboration with a notable luxury brand, though neither Murphy nor Marchesi could offer details at press time. But coming on the heels of this slew of updates, exploratory projects and efforts in development, it\u2019s unlikely to be a rank-and-file debut.\n\nWhether any of it succeeds in drawing mainstream interest remains to be seen. But one thing seems quite clear \u2014 The Fabricant\u2019s swirl of activity in the last five years might be nothing compared to what the next five brings."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe gaming NFT marketplace Aqua is no more, CEO Sean Ryan announced on Linkedin Friday. The plan was first shared last month, but as of today, it's official.\n\n\u201cAt Aqua, we did some things well and some things not as well, but the Web3 gaming market isn't scaling to a mass market size in a time frame that made sense,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cTherefore, it was time to call it a day and move on to other opportunities, especially for our awesome employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm still a firm believer in the idea that gamers will own their gaming assets, but it's going to take a bit longer [than] we had all hoped,\u201d the CEO added.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRyan, who previously worked as a VP at Facebook, launched Aqua in 2022 and partnered with blockchain firms like Immutable and Polygon Labs. Now, after less than two years, the \u201cplayer-focused\u201d NFT gaming startup has closed its doors.\n\nhttps://t.co/GOdYHhqYNu will be ceasing operations as of December 1, 2023. For players with an AQUA Wallet, please follow the instructions in the link below to transfer your funds into a different wallet, or reach out to support@aqua.xyz for assistance.https://t.co/VMZ07tzcUJ pic.twitter.com/CGn6AgRrgS \u2014 AQUA.xyz (@aquadotxyz) November 17, 2023\n\nIn a graphic attached to the post, Ryan also shared that the startup struggled to raise funds in a broader crypto gaming market with \u201cslower-than-expected growth.\u201d\n\n\"I'm a strong believer in the category, but sometimes one is just too early,\" Ryan told Decrypt's GG when reached on Friday.\n\nAqua aimed to offer a gaming NFT marketplace as well as more white-glove, embedded marketplace solutions for game developers. The marketplace supported NFTs on Ethereum, as well as scaling networks Polygon and Immutable X.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this year, Ryan told Decrypt in an interview that Aqua was designed for true gamers\u2014not \u201cdegen\u201d crypto traders looking to make money by flipping gaming NFTs for profit.\n\nAnd from his conversations with over 50 different blockchain game developers, Ryan found that devs overwhelmingly wanted a seamless game marketplace that doesn\u2019t pull gamers out to a third-party website.\n\nSuch has been said again recently by Aqua\u2019s competitors at Sequence, which just launched its own tool for devs to make their own in-game marketplaces.\n\nFor better or worse, there\u2019s now tons of competition in the gaming NFT marketplace space. Gaming key retailer G2A recently took its leap into NFT sales, OpenSea has revamped its gaming offerings and content (but has laid off staff), and Magic Eden has also emphasized gaming as a core focus going forward.\n\nBut Aqua isn\u2019t the only gaming NFT platform that\u2019s pulled back this year. In August, GameStop announced it was killing its NFT wallet, citing \u201cregulatory uncertainty.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Meme Moguls (MGLS) Causing A Buying Frenzy, How High Can They Go? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is infamously known for its volatility, which can lead to major price shifts within a short period. In August, Bitcoin lost more than 10% of its value within the span of a few days, a clear nightmare for investors.\n\nDespite optimism among investors with hopes that Bitcoin will rise up and gain lost ground, the cryptocurrency experienced yet another decline, with the price dropping as low as $36,770 from its initial opening price of $37,250. Threading the same path, Ethereum also witnessed a decline in value, hitting a 24-hour low of 2,002 from its opening price of $2,050.\n\nHowever, there is a contrasting reality for Meme Moguls as analysts project a bullish momentum. While the reasons are not far-fetched, the following analysis sheds more light on why Bitcoin and Ethereum are taking a dive in the crypto market whereas investors are eagerly embracing Meme Moguls.\n\n>>Buy Meme Moguls<<\n\nBitcoin Takes a Dip Amidst Investor Optimism\n\nBitcoin recorded losses as it dipped by 0.69% as of the time of writing, signaling a further decline from its recent peak of $38,200. The largest and most popular cryptocurrency by market cap is now trading under $38,000, with a 24-hour trading volume of $19.7B according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe recent price action in Bitcoin in the last 24 hours also left the token market capitalization at $743,960,549,311, resulting in a change of 2.20%.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not surprising to witness this retraction in the price of Bitcoin, considering the cryptocurrency has enjoyed a smooth run for some time in the month of November. For more context, the cryptocurrency started the month at the price of $34,397 and achieved a recent new high slightly above $38,000, accounting for roughly 11% increase in less than three weeks.\n\nWhile experts remain bullish about Bitcoin, price prediction by Changelly forecasts a 3.23% increase from the current market price, portraying a potential value of $38,666 by November 28, 2023. But that remains to be seen. Investors are hopeful that bitcoin price will pick up as several factors continue to support gains for Bitcoin including optimism that U.S. regulators will soon approve the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in early 2024.\n\nEthereum Witnesses a Downside of 0.73%\n\nAs reported by CoinMarketCap, Ethereum has had its fair share in price drop at the time of writing declining by about 0.73%. The second largest cryptocurrency is currently trading slightly below $2,060, with a potential to swing back upward.\n\nIn comparison, the price of Ethereum was valued at $2,070 a day ago, further suggesting that despite the dip, there\u2019s been some slight bullish activity.\n\nGoing by recent claims by the CoinDCX research team while speaking with Republic World, Ethereum overcoming the resistance at $2,130 is important for a bullish scenario. If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,080 resistance, it just might lead to a fresh decline.\n\nInvestors More Excited to Jump on Meme Moguls (MGLS)\n\nAway from Ethereum and Bitcoin, Meme Moguls is another cryptocurrency gearing up to experience a tremendous jump in value. It is an innovative DeFi earning platform that lets users enjoy an absorbing fantasy gaming experience.\n\nWith Meme Moguls (MGLS), participants can create custom avatars using their most loved memes and build their fortune through their meme portfolio. They can also trade or sell character NFTs on the marketplace along with other rare NFT items and mined materials representing real-world assets. Meme Moguls is then the first world\u2019s meme-based assets exchange.\n\n\ud83d\udd25Hot dang Meme Moguls!\ud83d\udd25 Here\u2019s a sweet TUTORIAL on how to BUY $MGLS in under 2 minutes! \u23f1\ufe0f WATCH NOW \u2b07\ufe0f It\u2019s SO easy even this dancing banana can do it! \ud83c\udf4c\ud83d\udc83 Just follow along!

This P2E approach offers participants multiple ways to earn rewards.\n\nAt the moment, Meme Moguls has investors rushing to buy its MGLS token at $0.0021 on its website in stage one. Analysts have predicted a 20x rise in price as it advances.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Ronin is an Ethereum sidechain network built for crypto games.\n\nThe Binance exchange itself does not currently list Ronin\u2019s main token, RON\u2014so users will have to buy it on a decentralized exchange (DEX). Binance does list SLP and AXS on its exchange for users in some countries, however.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt time of writing, the Binance Pay integration is only available for the Ronin mobile app. A quick test of the Ronin wallet browser extension on Chrome in the U.S. only shows Ramp or Ronin\u2019s blockchain bridge as options to deposit funds.\n\nRonin Wallet x @binance Pay \u2694\ufe0f \u2022 Deposit from Binance via mobile Ronin wallet\n\n\u2022 Auto-convert BTC, ETH, and more into AXS, SLP, and USDC on Ronin\n\n\u2022 AMA on Spaces with the Binance Pay team next week (more details coming soon) Learn more here \ud83d\udc47 \ud83d\udcdc | https://t.co/qP8dKO9mh9 pic.twitter.com/xOaF5yNiJi \u2014 Ronin (@Ronin_Network) December 1, 2023\n\nRonin\u2019s partnership with Binance Pay comes less than two weeks after news broke that Binance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao would plead guilty to money laundering charges and step down from his role at the exchange. Binance has already announced its new CEO, Richard Teng, and Binance users have withdrawn over $1 billion in funds from the exchange in the wake of its upheaval.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Binance also won\u2019t be available for customers in the U.S. for much longer, so Ronin\u2019s Binance Pay integration comes primarily for the benefit of mobile users outside of the U.S.\n\nWhile Binance has seen users pull their funds, Ronin saw a surge in activity and tripled its active user numbers in early November.

I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nThe outburst comes after Rune Christensen, MakerDAO co-founder and CEO revealed plans to remove the protocol\u2019s NewChain from Ethereum and fork it on the Solana blockchain. While his intentions may have been harmless, the community received it as a battle of the best between Solana and Ethereum. To Yakovenko, however, this battle can only be detrimental to the ecosystem.\n\nDiscrediting the perception that \u201cSolana thrives and somehow Ethereum dies,\u201d Yakovenko demonstrates optimism in Danksharding being able to have adequate bandwidth to contain the entire expanse of Solana data.\n\nNotably, Danksharding is a technology that enables blockchain technology to add cheaper blocks. It is an Ethereum rollup scaling method that expands transactional throughput by increasing storage space for roll-up transactions.\n\nNot the first time\n\nThis is not the first time Yakovenko is attempting to quell the Solana versus Ethereum feud. In an October citing, jebus.eth, an Ethereum community member took shots at Solana, likening it to the Democrat Party of crypto. He called it a \u201cCoalition of poors and wealthy people,\u201d who lack an understanding of value and its source, adding that it was a group of people who prioritized cheap over value.\n\nSol is like the dem party of crypto\n\n\n\nCoallition of poors and wealthy ppl who don't understand where value actually comes from or how to create it, just that the things I want should be cheap \u2014 Jebus.eth (@jebus911) October 1, 2023\n\nIn response, Yakovenko defended, \u201cIn the grand theatre of economic transformation, Ethereum presents itself not as a harbinger of genuine revolution, but merely as a novel spectacle of bourgeois upheaval.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Solana price remains committed to the north, boasting a 2% surge on the day, accompanied by an 11% climb in trading volume. The parity between price and trading volume points to strong interest in the asset by buyers. It also points to higher liquidity, better order execution, and a more active market for connecting a buyer and seller.\n\nAt the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading for $63.58, with eyes peeled on the $70.00 mark amid rising momentum and the presence of bulls in the SOL market. This is indicated by the northbound RSI and the green histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) in the positive territory."

This follows Binance\u2019s and former CEO Changpeng Zhao\u2019s (CZ) capitulation to the US Department of Justice (DoJ). Evidence of this has been reported by on-chain aggregator IntoTheBlock, showing that the exchange\u2019s stock, COIN, is up 300% this year, outpacing both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which are up 130% and 75% year to date.\n\nPrice performance: COIN, BTC, ETH, MicroStrategy\n\nThe data aggregator indicates that with the 300% value surge this year, trading volume has played a key role in driving the price. Fourth-quarter volumes have already surpassed what was recorded in the third quarter despite there being one full month to go before the final quarter ends.\n\nThe COIN chart on TradingView corroborates this outlook, showing a steep climb in COIN\u2019s share price in Q4. Specifically, it shows an 87% value surge since October 30 and a 61% rally since November 1.\n\nCOIN is already massively overbought, evidenced by the position of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 70. Nevertheless, the inclination of this momentum indicator shows that there could still be more upside potential.\n\nSimilarly, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicator is in positive territory with green-soaked histogram bars demonstrating that bulls have control of the COIN market.\n\nTradingView: COIN 1-day chart\n\nCoinbase CEO advertises the exchange at Binance\u2019s expense\n\nIt should be noted that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong already pedaled the exchange following Binance\u2019s bubble bursting on November 21, saying, \u201cWe now have an opportunity to start a new chapter for this industry\u2026Americans should not have to go to offshore, unregulated exchanges to benefit from this technology.\u201d\n\nArmstrong touted the US as the rightful hub for crypto, highlighting that Coinbase believes in economic freedom and that the US democratic system will eventually get things right.\n\nSince the founding of Coinbase back in 2012 we have taken a long-term view. I knew we needed to embrace compliance to become a generational company that stood the test of time. We got the licenses, hired the compliance and legal teams, and made it clear our brand was about trust\u2026 \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) November 21, 2023\n\nRipple lawyer John E. Deaton corroborated the allusion. He attributed the assumption to the fact that the exchange has been named in the surveillance sharing agreement (SSA) of multiple institutional players that have filed for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) with the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), as indicated on NASDAQ's 19b-4 form.\n\n@coinbase will be a big winner. I expect to see BlackRock and Vanguard buy more. Btw, 90% of @GaryGensler\u2019s $120M fortune is with Vanguard. See how this works, yet? https://t.co/WHWGNY4vQJ \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) November 21, 2023\n\nNevertheless, Coinbase is not free of its own regulatory troubles. In a recent event, the exchange was found guilty of administrative offense and fined 1 million Rubles in Russia for non-compliance. This is aside from its ongoing contention with the SEC over securities law violations."

        "content": "In the vast landscape of cryptocurrencies, where market trends resemble winding trails, enthusiasts and investors often seek the best navigation routes. Today, our journey takes us through the hikers' haven of digital assets, exploring the recent success of GameStop Memes ($GSM) and its $4 million presale triumph. As we traverse the crypto trails, we'll also ascend the peaks of Ethereum (ETH) price analysis, discover why Stellar (XLM) coin has become a shining star, and unveil the allure of top crypto presales.\n\nEthereum Price: Navigating the Peaks and Valleys\n\nOur first stop on this crypto excursion brings us to the Ethereum peaks and valleys. The Ethereum price, akin to rugged mountain terrain, has recently encountered a downward slope from $2,130, currently resting below $2,060. In the cryptocurrency landscape, Ethereum stands tall as one of the best cryptocurrencies, but every trial has its challenges.\n\nAs we tread the Ethereum path, there's a significant resistance near $2,040, a formidable peak that ETH aims to conquer. This journey mirrors the undulating nature of crypto markets, a reminder that even the mightiest can face declines. But fear not, for Ethereum may find its footing like a seasoned hiker and ascend again. In the midst of Ethereum's price analysis, the presence of GameStop Memes is akin to a fellow hiker on this crypto trail. The $4 million presale success of $GSM adds an element of excitement and camaraderie, reminding us that in the dynamic crypto landscape, even the unexpected can become a trailblazer.\n\nStellar Coin: Milestones Ahead\n\nOur journey continues under the celestial canopy as we navigate towards Stellar, a shining star in the crypto night sky. Stellar coin enthusiasts have witnessed forecasts of an astronomical surge, with projections reaching an extraordinary 3,006%, aiming for the symbolic milestone of $3.50.\n\nAs with any celestial body, Stellar coin has experienced a recent dip, dropping by 5.29% to $0.116. However, EGRAG, our stargazing crypto analyst, remains undeterred in its bullish outlook. EGRAG's emphasis on the Fibonacci Circle 1.414 pattern as a support level adds a constellation of hope to Stellar's journey, indicating that this dip might be a passing meteor shower in the broader galaxy of potential growth. In the cosmic ballet of crypto, $GSM emerges as a radiant companion to XLM. The $4 million presale success of GameStop Memes echoes through the stellar expanse, a testament to this financial galaxy's diverse and unpredictable nature.\n\nGo Beyond the Ordinary With $GSM\n\nAs hikers of the crypto trails, we now set our sights on the expansive horizon of top crypto presales. These presales, akin to hidden treasures waiting to be discovered, redefine how investors engage with promising projects before they hit the mainstream and become the best cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn this section, the spotlight falls on GameStop Memes' presale triumph, securing an impressive $4 million. The success of GameStop Memes in the presale arena is a trailhead moment, signalling that this meme-driven token is not just making waves; it's creating a tidal shift in how crypto enthusiasts participate in the financial landscape.\n\nSummit Crypto Peaks with GameStop Memes\n\nAs we reach the summit of our crypto hiking expedition, the echoes of GameStop Memes' $4 million presale success reverberate through the peaks and valleys of Ethereum price analyses, the celestial expanse of Stellar coin forecasts, and the vast landscape of top crypto presales. GameStop Memes, like a seasoned guide on this crypto trail, proves that every dip, surge, and presale can be a transformative experience. As we descend from these heights, let the momentum of GameStop Memes serve as a compass, guiding us through the ever-evolving terrain of the cryptocurrency world. Happy trails, fellow crypto hikers.\n\n\n\nInvest in GSM while it's still in presale!\n\nWebsite: https://gamestmemes.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopMemes"

        "content": "TLDR\n\nEddy Zillan\u2019s crypto investments reached over $500,000 in 2017 after committing $12,000 in 2012; he now has sights on Rebel Satoshi .\n\nRebel Satoshi is set to fuel a rebellious movement with a meme coin\n\nTeen investor Eddy Zillan hit it big with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) during 2017\u2019s bull market. Now 24, the youngster has found another top crypto to invest in with Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ).\n\nThis is a new rebel-inspired meme coin sensation modeled after Bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. While the sentiment for Bitcoin and Ethereum is bullish, Rebel Satoshi may provide more substantial returns.\n\nEddy Zillan: From $12,000 to Over Half A Million Dollars In Five Years\n\nFor their bar mitzvah at 13 in 2012, Zillan\u2019s parents blessed him with $5,000 for an investment fund. While his folks expected the teenager to dabble in traditional markets like stocks, he took an alternative, obscure approach. Zillan started to buy top crypto coins, most notably Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nHe saved up an extra $7,000 through tennis club and other jobs. Thus, their total investment was $12,000. Through the years, the value of his holdings kept soaring and soaring. In November 2017, Zillan held over $500,000 in value, with a return surpassing 4,100%. Understandably, Zillan was featured in many media publications from late 2017 to 2018 following his success.\n\nEddy is still bullish on Bitcoin and Ethereum, particularly with the institutional interest both projects are receiving. Furthermore, predictions align with this sentiment. Bitcoin will likely be worth $40,000-$45,000 (or higher) in 2024. Meanwhile, Ethereum is expected to hit a minimum yearly peak of $3,000.\n\nStill, Zillan has eyes on Rebel Satoshi, rooted in decentralization and explosive potential.\n\nRebel Satoshi Introduces Rebellious Energies In Meme Coins\n\nRebel Satoshi is an eccentric meme coin pushing for rebellion and defiance against the status quo. It\u2019s inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto, who ushered in the digital revolution with Bitcoin, resulting in a flood of the best DeFi coins like Ethereum.\n\nThe 16th-century Guy Fawkes is another motivation, a symbol of social justice and freedom fighting. Both the spirits of Nakamoto and Fawkes resonate with Rebel Satoshi in their quest for decentralization. The prime long-term goal is to exceed $100 million in market cap, showing what a small yet like-minded community can achieve without a centralized financial system.\n\nIt provides an attractive ecosystem, which will be key to attaining this goal. The first part is the Rebel Artefacts Vault, a treasure chest of 9,999 unique collectibles and digital art in NFT form. The Revolutionary Staking Hub will also fuel much-needed buzzing trading activity. Here, users will stake the $RBLZ token, earning brilliant passive income while fortifying the network\u2019s security.\n\nThe Early Bird Round of Rebel Satoshi\u2018s presale was an exhilarating three weeks. It began on Bonfire Night (November 05, 2023) to honor Guy Fawkes. $RBLZ\u2018s value increased 30% from $0.010 to $0.013 in the current Rebel Rounds 1, indicating sheer demand.\n\nCurrent buyers can grab more tokens with a time-limited 15% bonus. The presale end comes with several exciting events. Firstly, the platform will \u2018burn\u2018 any unsold tokens, another symbolic nod to Fawkes. Moreover, the first NFT collection will be released. Finally, buyers can expect a 92% gain in their holdings as $RBLZ will be worth $0.025.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "The Best Crypto Investment: GameStop Memes Beats BNB and Ethereum ROIs with a $4 Million Presale Surge - Tekedia",
        "content": "When we talk about the dynamism of the cryptocurrency world, we are in for a great ride on the excitement of potential gains and the ever-evolving market dynamics that make investors\u2019 choices harder and harder. So, today, we will explore the strategies and impacts of three amazing digital assets: Binance Coin (BNB), Ethereum (ETH), and the current innovator, GameStop Memes (GMS).\n\nIn this article, we will shed light on whether these three currencies will be a successful investment in the world of cryptocurrencies in 2024, especially after the $4 million presale of GameStop Memes.\n\nBNB Sees Surge in Popularity\n\nIn the first corner of our crypto battlefront, we have Binance Coin (BNB), the native cryptocurrency of the world-renowned Binance exchange. BNB has been a prominent player in the crypto space, known for its utility and versatility. Originally launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, BNB transitioned to Binance\u2019s native blockchain, Binance Chain, through a coin swap.\n\nBinance Coin\u2019s primary function is to fuel transactions and interactions within the Binance ecosystem. Users can utilise BNB to pay for trading fees, transaction fees, and even goods and services from merchants that accept them. This utility has solidified BNB\u2019s position in the crypto market and continues to evolve.\n\nOne of the key factors driving Binance Coin\u2019s popularity is its participation in various Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales on the Binance Launchpad. This has allowed investors to access promising projects at an early stage, potentially reaping significant rewards, which means it is likely to be a good investment in 2024.\n\nEthereum: An Uncertain Investment in 2024?\n\nIn the opposite corner, Ethereum (ETH) stands out for its groundbreaking approach to blockchain technology. While Bitcoin primarily focuses on digital currency, Ethereum takes a broader perspective.\n\nLaunched by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, enabling developers to create decentralised applications (DApps) and customise blockchain solutions. This innovation opened doors to a wide range of applications beyond traditional finance.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has grappled with scalability issues. Its current infrastructure struggles to handle a high volume of transactions efficiently. This has resulted in high gas fees and slower transaction processing times, limiting its potential; therefore, Ethereum may not be a good investment in 2024.\n\nGameStop Memes\u2019 Disruptive Entry to Crypto\n\nNow, let\u2019s shine the spotlight on the disruptor of the hour, GameStop Memes (GMS). Inspired by the GameStop saga that made headlines, GMS takes the meme culture to new heights by turning popular internet memes into tradable assets.\n\nGameStop Memes\u2019 strength lies in its community-driven ethos. It thrives on the collective enthusiasm of its users, who come together to celebrate and invest in their favourite memes. While it may not possess the technological sophistication of Ethereum or the dominance of Binance Coin, it introduces an element of fun and community spirit to the crypto space.\n\nMoreover, GameStop Memes made a significant mark by amassing an impressive $4 million during its presale, signifying growing interest and support for this meme-inspired cryptocurrency. While its long-term impact on the crypto market remains uncertain, it undeniably injects excitement and unpredictability into the scene.\n\nWe\u2019ve explored the strengths and strategies of Binance Coin, Ethereum, and GameStop Memes in this crypto battle. Binance Coin excels in utility and participation in token sales, Ethereum pioneer\u2019s innovation with its smart contracts, and GameStop Memes adds a playful twist to the world of crypto.\n\nSo far, the GameStop Memes method seems effective and distinct after achieving $4 million in presale.\n\nInvest in GSM while it\u2019s still in presale!\n\nWebsite: https://GameStopmemes.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopopMemes\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "Solana\u2019s creation was designed to work with all the functionalities of Ethereum and improve upon the issues that arose in the network\u2019s early days. The blockchain has since grown in popularity in the past few years, with many crypto participants touting Solana as the one to dethrone Ethereum in the altcoin market. However, it seems Solana\u2019s co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko is tired of the comparison, and just wants a situation where the network can thrive.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko\u2019s Thoughts On The \u2018Ethereum Killer\u2019 Label\n\nSolana has done well since the October bottom which led to market gains in the wider crypto market. The crypto\u2019s price has done 197% gains since the middle of October and is up by 531% from its 2023 open of around $9.96. At the same time, Solana\u2019s TVL in DeFi has also grown spectacularly, adding 74.67% in the past month and $482 million since the beginning of 2023.\n\nFurthermore, according to the data provided by DeFiLlama, the daily trade volume of Solana\u2019s DeFi has been surpassing that of Ethereum L2 Chains like as Polygon and Optimism. All these on-chain metrics, coupled with the recent proposal by MakerDAO\u2019s co-founder Rune Christensen to utilize a fork of Solana\u2019s codebase for the creation of MakerDAO\u2019s upcoming native chain called \u201cNewChain\u201d appears to have sparked another round of assertions that Solana is a potential Ethereum killer.\n\nSOL market cap currently at $26.64 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nYakovenko recently took to social media platform X to speak on the recent Ethereum killer making rounds again. According to him, both networks can co-exist even while competing and having most of the same features.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bring back last cycle \u201ceth killer\u201d bs,\u201d Yakovenko said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a future where solana thrives and somehow eth dies,\u201d he continued.\n\nDon\u2019t bring back last cycle \u201ceth killer\u201d bs. It\u2019s lame. Pareto efficient technologies can have overlapping features and will compete, but that\u2019s all ok. I don\u2019t see a future where solana thrives and somehow eth dies. I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nThe Future Of Ethereum And Solana\n\nSolana was initially created to address Ethereum\u2019s scaling solution, as the network could only process 15 transactions per second in its early days. Solana\u2019s solution then came with a combination of proof-of-history and delegated proof-of-stake protocols to process more than 50,000 transactions per second. Other networks like Cardano that serve the same use-case were also touted as potential Ethereum killers.\n\nHowever, this scalability issue has since been addressed on Ethereum and the network can now process up to 100,000 transactions per second. Layer-2 protocols have also been built, and Ethereum continues to retain its title as the king of altcoins.\n\nEthereum developers are also looking to increase transactional throughput by introducing a rollup scaling method called danksharding. Yakovenko also believes danksharding will eventually have enough bandwidth to accommodate all of Solana\u2019s data.\n\nSolana is currently trading at $63.43 and is on its way to the $70 price point. The first step would be to break above the yearly high of $65.5.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock"

        "content": "On-chain data shows the ten largest Ethereum whales have continued to expand their holdings recently, now carrying 41 million ETH.\n\nEthereum Top 10 Whales Have Set A New All-Time High For Their Holdings\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the largest whale wallets have continued to display an optimistic pattern for the cryptocurrency. There are two indicators of interest here: the supply held by top exchange wallets and the supply held by top non-exchange wallets.\n\nThe former keeps track of the total amount of Ethereum that the ten largest wallets attached to centralized exchanges are holding right now. In comparison, the latter measures the amount sitting in the ten largest self-custodial wallets on the blockchain.\n\nBoth types of addresses would count as \u201cwhales,\u201d but those attached to the exchanges would be more likely to control an entity like the platform itself rather than a \u201cnormal\u201d investor, like a self-custodial wallet would most likely be.\n\nThe chart below shows how the Ethereum supply held by these two cohorts has changed over the past year.\n\nThe value of the two metrics have gone opposite ways in recent days | Source: Santiment on X\n\nThe graph shows that the supply held by the top ten whales outside exchanges has been constantly going up during the past year, while the addresses attached to exchanges have been rather up and down.\n\nGenerally, investors keep their coins inside self-custodial wallets whenever they want to hold onto them for extended periods. So, these off-exchange whales continuing to increase their supply is undoubtedly a positive sign for the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs is apparent from the chart, the supply of these whales has crossed the 41 million ETH mark following the latest continuation of the uptrend, which is a new all-time high.\n\nWhile this rise has come, the top ten Ethereum exchange wallets have seen a plunge instead, as they now hold just 8 million ETH, the lowest amount in about 24 weeks.\n\nA shift of supply towards self-custody is always a good sign for the health of the market, as bankruptcies like that of the FTX exchange already showed during this bear market what happens when central platforms like these go bust.\n\nThe less ETH that\u2019s present on the exchanges, the less the price would be affected if they happen to go out of business. And that\u2019s not all; the supply on exchanges can also be considered the available selling supply of ETH, which has also reduced with this drawdown.\n\nTherefore, this pattern of the self-custodial wallets growing in size while the exchanges lose coins is an encouraging development for the asset. Though while that may be true, supply concentrating on just ten wallets is still something negative, as these humongous entities now control one-third of the supply.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading just below the $2,100 mark, down 1% in the past week.\n\nETH has overall gone up during the past 24 hours | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Vivek Kumar on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"

        "content": "The Ethereum community finds itself buzzing with excitement today as the price of Ether (ETH) experiences a notable surge. Investors, enthusiasts, and market analysts alike are left pondering the driving forces behind this sudden upswing.\n\nFrom fundamental developments within the Ethereum ecosystem to external influences shaping the digital currency landscape, this is the reason behind today\u2019s remarkable surge in Ethereum prices.\n\nEthereum price starts Dec on an upswing\n\nEther (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, has made remarkable gains, with its price reclaiming $2,1000 levels. The bullishness comes as the US SEC opens up discussions for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nAt the time of this publication, the price of ETH is $2,093.73, with a 24-hour trading volume of $15,199,416,151.51. This is a 2.98% increase in the previous 24 hours and a 1.21% increase in the last 7 days.\n\nMichael van de Poppe, a crypto analyst, is bullish on Ethereum following the Fidelity filing. In light of this filing, he reaffirms his conviction that, following the rise of Bitcoin, ETH would reach $3,500 in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n#Ethereum Spot ETF filing by Fidelity!\n\n\n\nConfirms my thesis that after #Bitcoin gets its shine, we\u2019ll see Ethereum running to $3,500 in Q1 2024. \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 30, 2023\n\nHere are some of the factors influencing the price of ETH. The Ethereum whale accumulation has been quite vigorous. In addition, on-chain data reveals the substantial exchange of wallet holdings. The largest Ethereum wallets, according to Santiment, are exhibiting a bullish pattern, signaling a significant shift.\n\nExchange wallets have reached an all-time low of 8.03 million ETH in the last six months, while non-exchange wallets have reached an all-time high of 41.03 million ETH. As more currencies move away from exchanges, this trend shows an increasing preference for self-custody.\n\nIn November, the price of ETH increased by 13%, beating Bitcoin\u2019s 8% increase. Blackrock\u2019s official filing for a spot ETH ETF (Ether-based Exchange Traded Fund) was a big contributor to Ethereum\u2019s growth.\n\nDespite the dwindling media frenzy around ETFs, on-chain data shows that ETH\u2019s price volatility has overtaken Bitcoin\u2019s. This pattern may attract swing traders and short-term day traders to invest in ETH rather than BTC in December as well.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Goerli Testnet to end support and upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum development team announced on Thursday, November 30, that the blockchain\u2018s multi-client testnet Goerli would no longer receive support from the client and ETH Foundation testing teams.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will be the final and final implementation, culminating in a team exit three months after Goerli Dencun activation or one month after Dencun mainnet activation.\n\nUsers that rely on Goerli for stable testnet environments are recommended to migrate ahead of time, according to the ETH Foundation. Despite Goerli staking\u2019s permissionless nature, the departure of validators from client and testing teams, who comprise a considerable stake majority, offers possible stability concerns. At the same time, teams intend to use this transition to test delayed finality, inactivity leaks, and mass slashings.\n\nIn the coming months, Goerli, Ethereum\u2019s first multi-client testnet, will stop being supported by client and EF testing teams. The Dencun network upgrade will be the last one implemented on the network. Either three months after the Goerli Dencun activation, or one month after the Dencun mainnet activation, whichever comes later, teams will begin exiting their validators [1]. Anyone relying on Goerli as a stable testnet should migrate elsewhere prior to this. Ethereum\n\nWhile Goerli is likely to be the first testnet to activate the Dencun upgrade, the Ethereum team will disclose the exact date as soon as possible.\n\nThe ETH Foundation recommends that developers use Sepolia to test decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other ETH Virtual Machine (EVM) features. The permissioned validator set provided by Sepolia ensures a stable testing environment. Alternatively, testing against ETH mainnet state copies is made easier by a variety of local development environments.\n\nStakers and infrastructure providers interested in protocol-level testing could look into the freshly launched Holesky testnet, on which anyone can run a validator. The Ephemery testnet provides a weekly reset capability for validator setup testing, allowing for lightweight end-to-end testing of the validator lifecycle.\n\nThe ETH blockchain network has gone a long way through multiple modifications over the years. The upcoming ETH improvements will mostly focus on increasing scalability."
