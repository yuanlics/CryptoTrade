        "title": "Difficulty Bomb: Ethereum's Increasing Difficulty in Mining - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Was the Difficulty Bomb?\n\nEthereum launched using the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, an algorithm that uses large amounts of energy and computational power. This mechanism uses a competitive reward system that encourages mining\u2014and centralized mining farms that have taken over the network. However, this centralization goes against the original decentralization tenet behind cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum's \"difficulty bomb\" referred to the intentional and sudden increase in mining difficulty on the blockchain. It was released to coincide with the blockchain's transition to proof-of-stake. The intent behind the difficulty bomb was to exponentially increase the amount of time it took to mine a new block on the Ethereum blockchain so that it:\n\nEncouraged cryptocurrency miners to move away from energy-intensive proof-of-work mining by removing the incentive\n\nTook away the ability to centralize currency creation and ownership\n\nDiscouraged blockchain forks\n\nForced node upgrades\n\nKey Takeaways Ethereum\u2019s \u201cdifficulty bomb\u201d referred to a sudden increase in mining difficulty to discourage miners from opting to stay with the proof-of-work mechanism after it transitioned to proof-of-stake.\n\nDifficulty refers to the time and computational power needed to verify a cryptocurrency's transactions within a blockchain under the proof-of-work mechanism.\n\nEthereum's difficulty bomb deployed at block 15530314 on Sept. 14, 2022, the day before \"The Merge\" went live.\n\nUnderstanding the Difficulty Bomb\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, the term difficulty describes a setting that keeps the network randomly guessing for the target solution for a prescribed amount of time. It is calculated in different ways by different blockchains, but the Bitcoin blockchain uses the current difficulty, the expected time, and the actual time to calculate the new difficulty.\n\nMining a cryptocurrency is often confused with creating a coin; however, mining is the verification process that involves guessing a 64-character hash that is less than the target value set by the network. When a miner's machine guesses correctly, they are rewarded with a coin.\n\nEthereum's developers created the difficulty bomb to increase the difficulty of solving the hash exponentially, eventually making it too expensive in time and energy to be worth the cost.\n\nEthereum's developers always intended to move to proof-of-stake, which is claimed to consume 99.95% less energy than proof-of-work.\n\nEthereum\u2019s difficulty bomb is a deterrent for miners, who may have wanted to fork the original blockchain to continue mining using the PoW mechanism. The primary reason miners didn't want to switch to PoS is that the expensive mining machines and farms they created would become obsolete, at least as far as earning rewards for profits.\n\nDifficulty Bomb Challenges\n\nMigrating to PoS was an enormous challenge for the developers\u2014they had to keep pushing the difficulty bomb release date back because The Merge kept being rescheduled. Releasing the bomb before upgrading to PoS would have been counterproductive\u2014the difficulty bomb would have significantly slowed down transactions and severely congested the network.\n\nThere have been six upgrades that, among other fixes, pushed back the difficulty bomb:\n\n2017 : Byzantium update\n\n: Byzantium update 2019 : Constantinople update\n\n: Constantinople update 2020 : Muir Glacier update (difficulty bomb only)\n\n: Muir Glacier update (difficulty bomb only) 2021 : London update\n\n: London update 2021 : Arrow Glacier update (difficulty bomb only)\n\n: Arrow Glacier update (difficulty bomb only) 2022: Gray Glacier (difficulty bomb only)\n\nIs Ethereum Getting Harder to Mine? Ether (ETH), the native Ethereum blockchain and ecosystem cryptocurrency, can no longer be mined due to the transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus.\n\nWhat Does Ethereum Difficulty Mean? Ethereum difficulty referred to the increasing amount of time it took to validate transactions under the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The transition to proof-of-stake in September 2022 removed PoW as the consensus mechanism for the Ethereum blockchain, so difficulty is no longer an issue.\n\nWhat Will Happen to Ethereum Miners After The Merge? Ether (ETH), Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, can no longer be mined. Miners will need to switch to a minable cryptocurrency if they want to continue mining. Alternatively, they can switch their mining activities to validation activities to earn rewards and help secure the blockchain.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEthereum's difficulty bomb was an attempt by its developers to discourage miners from forking the blockchain and continuing proof-of-work on an Ethereum-like blockchain. It was supposed to work by increasing the difficulty level to a point where mining was impossible when the blockchain switched to proof-of-stake. However, Ethereum Classic forked long before the transition, and other mineable forks were created.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "JPMorgan: Ethereum Will \u201cRecapture Market Share\u201d After Protodanksharding Upgrade\n\nJPMorgan analysts have expressed their expectation that Ethereum (ETH) will outperform Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies in 2024, despite maintaining a generally cautious stance on the crypto market for the upcoming year.\n\nIn a note published on Wednesday, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou stated, \"We believe that next year Ethereum will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem.\" They highlighted the EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as Protodanksharding, as the main catalyst for Ethereum's anticipated performance. This upgrade is set to take place during the first half of 2024 and is expected to significantly enhance Ethereum's network activity.\n\nProtodanksharding represents an initial step towards the implementation of Danksharding, a more efficient form of sharding for Ethereum. Unlike the original sharding technique, Danksharding simplifies the process by introducing data blobs, temporary data packets attached to blocks. These data blobs have greater data capacity than blocks, but they are not permanently stored or accessed by the Ethereum virtual machine.\n\nThe JPMorgan analysts emphasized that the upgrade would particularly benefit Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP). It would provide additional temporary data space, improving network throughput and reducing transaction fees for Layer 2 networks on Ethereum. Essentially, data blobs enhance the efficiency of Layer 2 networks without altering the Ethereum block size.\n\nJPMorgan analysts also indicated that factors expected to be bullish for Bitcoin in 2024, such as the possible approval of spot ETFs and the upcoming halving, are already factored into its price. They noted that the ratio of Bitcoin's market price to production cost decreased after the 2020 halving and stated that a similar response could be expected after the 2024 halving.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "JPMorgan expects ether to outperform bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2024, although the bank remains generally \"cautious\" about crypto markets in the coming year.\n\n\"We believe that next year Ethereum ETH +1.09% will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem,\" JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note on Wednesday. \"The main catalyst is the EIP-4844 upgrade or Protodanksharding, which is expected to take place during the first half of 2024. We believe that this upgrade will likely prove a bigger step towards improving Ethereum network activity, thus helping Ethereum to outperform.\"\n\nProtodanksharding is an initial step toward the full implementation of Danksharding, a more efficient form of sharding for Ethereum. Unlike the originally planned sharding technique, Danksharding avoids the complex process of splitting Ethereum into multiple shard chains. Instead, it introduces data blobs, temporary data packets attached to blocks, capable of holding more data than blocks but not permanently stored or accessed by the Ethereum virtual machine.\n\nThe upgrade is particularly beneficial for Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, JPMorgan analysts reiterated, as it provides an additional temporary data space to increase network throughput and reduce transaction fees for Layer 2 networks on Ethereum.

In addition, tokenization is evolving \"rather slowly,\" and it remains at a \"largely experimental stage hindered by fragmentation, lack of cooperation and interoperability between platforms, delays in the introduction of central bank digital currencies by the Fed and the ECB and lack of regulations,\" they added.\n\nCrypto VC funding outlook\n\nWhile venture capital funding in the crypto space in the fourth quarter of this year has improved compared to a rather subdued rest of the year, the improvement appears \"rather tentative\" to JPMorgan analysts.\n\n\"That said, to the extent this improvement continues into the first quarter of 2024 that would represent a significant development that would herald in our opinion the end of the crypto winter,\" the analysts said."

The currency now sits at $2,270. But its gains have lagged behind bitcoin, which has rocketed by around 154%.\n\nThe rally has largely been buttressed by optimism that a spot bitcoin ETF will get regulatory approval soon. But JPMorgan analysts are more skeptical about the bullish bets on bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto optimists believe a spot ETF approval would improve liquidity and lower the barrier of entry for more investors to invest in bitcoin without owning the currency. JPMorgan, however, thinks it's not so much new capital that would flow into the crypto as much as it is re-shuffled money from other crypto assets.\n\nAlso fueling the hype in bitcoin is the halving event scheduled for April next year, which tends to reduce the supply of the currency and lift prices. But the more bearish take by JPMorgan analysts is that the quadrennial event has been \"well factored\" into the current price, and the currency won't rally post-halving.\n\n\"We instead look for around 20% drop in the hash rate post halving as miners in higher cost locations or with less efficient hardware would be forced to exit the market,\" they wrote. \"This scenario would be more consistent with around $35k bitcoin price post halving.\""

While expressing caution broadly towards crypto markets, analysts highlighted Ethereum\u2019s coming transition as a potential bright spot.\n\nKey highlights:\n\nEthereum price expected to outperform Bitcoin based on Ethereum merge upgrades.\n\nRegulatory approval of Bitcoin ETFs is unlikely to drive major upside.\n\nJPMorgan anticipates that Ethereum will be the highest-performing cryptocurrency over the next year due to planned upgrades that will make the Ethereum network more efficient and scalable.\n\nRead more: SushiSwap And Other DApps Exploited Through Ledger Connect Vulnerability\n\nEthereum to dethrone Bitcoin\n\nThe EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d will add capacity to Ethereum through a new transaction type called \u201cblob-carrying transactions.\u201d By improving network bandwidth, analysts expect demand for Ether to increase, driving price gains versus Bitcoin and other altcoins.\n\nIn contrast, JPMorgan believes Bitcoin is at an overbought level, and regulatory approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is unlikely to have a lasting impact. They cited a \u201chigh chance of buy-the-rumor/sell-the-fact effect\u201d post-approval, meaning prices could quickly revert lower after an initial spike.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Will Surge Above $80,000 In 2024, Bitwise Predicts\n\nThe report also noted nascent signs that venture capital funding is stabilizing after the crypto crash of 2022. However, decentralized finance applications still lack connectivity with mainstream finance, which analysts see as necessary for further crypto adoption.\n\nWhile expressing a cautious view on cryptocurrency prices overall, JPMorgan remains constructive on Ethereum\u2019s roadmap and expects Ether to be a relative outperformer as network upgrades roll out over the next year.\n\nTheir analysis reinforces the view that crypto returns may prove selective based on project roadmaps rather than lifting the broader asset class."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum is experiencing a crucial moment, facing the most significant pullback since the beginning of the cryptocurrency market's bull run. This retracement is crucial for traders, with many keeping a close eye on the potential for a reversal at around the trendline support level on the ETH/USD chart. However, caution is advised, as the likelihood of a dramatic turnaround seems dim. The current market conditions and network challenges pose significant hurdles for Ethereum's immediate prospects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's price chart illustrates this recent downturn. After a period of consistent gains, ETH has encountered resistance, leading to a pullback that is stoking a mix of apprehension and anticipation among traders. The sharp decline in price from its recent highs has left investors questioning the durability of the bull run and whether Ethereum can muster the strength to pivot back to its former upward trajectory.\n\nA closer look at the price action shows Ethereum has not yet exhibited the full magnitude of a reversal. One of the critical factors influencing Ethereum's performance is the support, or lack thereof, for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem built on its blockchain.\n\nUnfortunately, the network has been plagued with unstable conditions, manifesting in the form of enormous transaction fees. These issues have dampened enthusiasm for DeFi projects, traditionally one of the primary catalysts for Ethereum's demand and, consequently, its price.\n\nThe market's response to Ethereum's challenges has been tepid. Without robust support for the DeFi sector, Ethereum's potential for a swift recovery seems compromised. The high gas fees have notably deterred smaller investors and projects, which has a knock-on effect on the entire Ethereum-based DeFi landscape. This setback comes at a time when competition from other blockchains with lower fees and faster transactions is intensifying. However, Layer-2 networks on Ethereum might change this in favor of the second-biggest blockchain in the industry."

        "content": "Ethereum price is moving lower below the $2,250 support zone. ETH is now at risk of more downsides below the $2,120 support zone.\n\nEthereum struggled to start a fresh increase above the $2,250 resistance.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key declining channel forming with resistance near $2,225 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to move down if it declines below the $2,120 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Takes Hit\n\nEthereum price attempted a fresh increase above the $2,120 and $2,150 levels. ETH even climbed above the $2,200 level, but the bears were active near the $2,250 level. A high was formed near $2,252 and the price started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the $2,200 support zone. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,980 swing low to the $2,252 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key declining channel forming with resistance near $2,225 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If there is a fresh increase, the pair might face resistance near the $2,200 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key resistance is near the $2,225 level or the channel trend line. The main resistance is still near $2,250. A clear move above the $2,250 zone could send the price toward the $2,300 level. The next resistance sits at $2,350. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,500 level.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,225 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,120 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,980 swing low to the $2,252 high.\n\nThe next key support is $2,045. The main support is now near $2,000. A downside break below $2,000 might start another major decline. In the stated case, Ether could revisit the $1,880 support. Any more losses might call for a test of the $1,820 support zone in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,120\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,225\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been constantly recording correction in value, indicating a bearish sentiment in the industry. Further, the star altcoin, Ethereum price has lost over 3% in its valuation within the past day, suggesting a cool-off in the crypto space.\n\nThe Ethereum price traded in a narrow space between $1,850 and $1,920 for a brief period. Following multiple attempts, the bulls gained power, and the price jumped over 14%, after which the coin faced rejection. The ETH price traded under a bearish influence for over a week.\n\nDuring this time, the price lost over 10% in value. The bulls held the price strong at the support level of $1,920, resulting in the price displaying significant price volatility and bouncing between the range of $1,920 and $2,069.\n\nTradingView: ETH/USDT\n\nFollowing this, the price traded sideways over the support/resistance level of $2,069 for a while and recorded a loss of over 3%. After multiple attempts, the market displays a strong uptrend, resulting in the leader of altcoin, gaining over 20% in value within a week.\n\nThis resulted in the ETH price recording a new yearly high. The Ethereum price was seen hovering close to its resistance level at $2,400 for a while, after which the coin lost momentum, resulting in a price drop.\n\nThe technical indicator, MACD, displays a rising histogram toward the neutral point, indicating an increasing buying-over-selling pressure in the market. On the other hand, the averages show a constant decline in the chart, suggesting a mixed sentiment in the market for the coin.\n\nWill The ETH Price Rise Again?\n\nIf the bulls hold the price above the support level of $2,136, the ETH price will regain momentum and prepare to test its resistance level of $2,200 soon.\n\nFurther, if the market holds the price at that level, it will continue to gain value and make a run to test its upper resistance level of $2,300.67 by the coming week.\n\nConversely, if the bear overpowers the bulls, the price will lose momentum and prepare to test its support level of $2,069. Moreover, if the bears continue to dominate the market, it will plunge further and test its lower support level of $1,996 in the coming time."

This change would enable the Cboe BZX Exchange to list and trade shares of the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF.\n\nAs per the notice, the 45-day period following the publication of the proposed rule change ends on December 23, 2023. The SEC has designated February 6, 2024, as the deadline for either approving or disapproving the rule change, or initiating proceedings to determine disapproval.\n\nThis comes as the SEC recently announced it will delay its decision on Grayscale's proposed Ethereum spot ETF, stating that it will need more time to assess a proposed rule change that would allow NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.\n\nNotably, other firms such as BlackRock, Hashdex, ARK 21Shares, VanEck, and Fidelity have also applied for spot crypto ETFs. Recently, representatives from these asset managers have held meetings with SEC officials to discuss their ETF offerings. This has raised speculation that an approval from the SEC is imminent, and that multiple spot ETF applications would be passed simultaneously.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "When it comes to scaling Ethereum, rollups are the name of the game. But as rollups increase transaction throughput, they face a challenge in where to store their data.\n\nThe obvious option is on Ethereum itself. Some argue that doing so is even core to the claim that rollups \u201cinherit\u201d Ethereum security. Ethereum\u2019s execution layer nodes store a complete copy of the blockchains ledger and history, allowing clients to independently verify the accuracy of its transaction history.\n\nWhile great for security and resilience, this comes at the cost of scalability. This is one of the main reasons why the Ethereum mainnet maxes out at around 15 transactions per second (TPS), and can be expensive during times of high demand.\n\nRead more: So your layer-2 is \u2018secured by Ethereum\u2019 \u2014 what does that mean?\n\nIncreasingly, blockchain developers are looking at alternatives for \u201cdata availability\u201d to resolve Ethereum\u2019s shortcomings. Some developers are turning towards modular blockchain solutions such as Celestia and Avail.\n\nModular blockchains often refer to networks that disaggregate specific blockchain functionalities. Dedicated data availability layers are designed to increase the efficiency of a blockchain, improve its transaction speeds and minimize costs.\n\nRead More: Why data availability sampling matters for blockchain scaling\n\nCelestia was one of the first data availability layers to launch its mainnet beta. Since October, it has seen over 900,000 transactions and around 278,000 accounts on its network, according to Celenium, Celestia\u2019s block explorer. The explorer does not break down the network\u2019s data volume or number of submissions.\n\nThe network has also been working on integrations with other layer-2 solutions, most recently with the Polygon CDK, enabling interested developers to choose Celestia for data availability alongside other options.\n\nFor developers using Optimism\u2019s OP Stack, Celestia also introduced Ethereum fallbacks \u2014 a backup solution for data availability. That means that if the Celestia network is temporarily unavailable, layer-2s can post their transaction batches back onto Ethereum mainnet. This avoids the risk that end-user funds remain stranded.\n\nAvail recently launched its testnet, dubbed \u201cClash of Nodes,\u201d which uses gamification to incentivize validators and light client operators with points and rewards, Anurag Arjun, Avail\u2019s co-founder, told Blockworks.\n\nAccording to Avail\u2019s blockchain explorer, there are 56,000 accounts on its testnet, which has processed over 1.2 million transactions since it began. Its mainnet is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.\n\nThe two networks serve a similar purpose, but there are some key differences.\n\nFor one, Arjun notes that Avail uses KZG polynomial commitments \u2014 a type of validity proof used to sample random parts of a block to verify it, without needing to access the full data.\n\nThese KZG commitments \u201care ideal for zero-knowledge-based blockchains, where efficiency, privacy and scalability are essential,\u201d Arjun said.\n\nCelestia instead uses secure hash functions, which Arjun notes \u201cintroduces potential delays in ensuring data availability guarantees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tradeoff here is that they have to rely on fraud proofs to confirm the accuracy of erasure coding,\u201d Arjun said.\n\nThe choice between these two depends on the specific requirements and priorities of a blockchain system.\n\nRead more: Sovereign rollups carve a path for blockchain scaling\n\nAside from Celestia and Avail, re-staking protocol EigenLayer has also recently revealed its plans to launch EigenDA.\n\nEthereum core developers are also not standing still; the core piece of Ethereum\u2019s next major upgrade Dencun will introduce \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d or EIP-4844, a process where costs of transactions are reduced by storing them in temporary data blobs.\n\nData availability and storage remains a significant cost driver on Ethereum. Solutions under development are still in their early stages. While its roadmap calls for an eventual transition to \u201cstateless\u201d Ethereum, the current data bloat puts the full Ethereum chain at nearly 1.4 terabytes.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

When asked why now, Lomashuk told The Block the motivation centers around furthering the development of these newer technologies. \"We believe that we can accelerate the technologies by investing capital,\" said Lomashuk.\n\nThe $100 million investment firm is being funded entirely with capital from cyber.Funds' founders, a spokesperson said by email.\n\nAlthough the flow of fresh capital into crypto and blockchain enterprises has continued during the last year, the amount of money being invested has slowed considerably from what it was during the bull run. Meanwhile, investment in artificial intelligence has soared, spurred partly by interest in projects like ChatGPT.\n\nEarly believers in top crypto projects\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBefore this re-launch, cyber.Fund was primarily active between 2014 and 2018, according to Lomashuk. The firm not only invested early in projects like Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot and Solana, but also helped build Lido Finance and P2P, according to Thursday's announcement. Lomashuk co-founded Lido Finance.\n\n\"Our aim is to create a more open, efficient and sustainable economy,\" cyber.Fund said in the post. \"We believe that by working to accelerate the growth, adoption and eventual decentralization of the these technologies, the world will enter a new age of unprecedented prosperity.\"\n\nCyber-Fund considers the emergence of a \"cybernetic\" world as inevitable and sees blockchain, robotics and AI playing a key role in shaping this new paradigm.\n\n\"We invested in Ethereum and build staking to keep it censorship resistant and decentralized,\" said Lomashuk. Now, \"instead of building we can invest in founders with the same values to build open source [technologies] good for humanity.\""

        "content": "The network of Ethereum layer-2 rollups using zkSync\u2019s ZK Stack got a new addition Thursday, with the launch of the Cronos zkEVM testnet.\n\nBlockchain developer Cronos Labs is developing its third blockchain, which is the first to use ZK Stack hyperchain to reach a live testnet.\n\nThe first chain in the Cronos ecosystem was a Cosmos appchain developed in partnership with the Crypto.com exchange and launched in 2021. Cronos then followed up with an EVM-compatible chain, also built using the Cosmos SDK in 2022. This new effort augments, but does not replace, the prior two chains.\n\nCronos\u2019 zkEVM is the result of a collaborative effort involving Cronos Labs, Matter Labs (the team behind zkSync), and several engineering teams from stakeholders Crypto.com and dapp developers on the existing chains.\n\nThe zkEVM testnet is built on top of the Ethereum Sepolia testnet and leverages zkSync\u2019s new open-source prover, Boojum, a STARK-based zero-knowledge proof system, notable for its low hardware requirements and low fees in the layer-2 rollup space.\n\nRead more: Polygon Zero and Matter Labs square off over open-source norms\n\nLaunching a native Ethereum chain was motivated by frustrations with bridging across EVM chains and between Cosmos and Ethereum, according to Ken Timsit, managing director at Cronos.\n\n\u201cWhen we started building Cronos as an EVM chain, we were, of course, already convinced that the Ethereum developer ecosystem has richness and robustness that has no comparison when it comes to building DeFi and NFT applications,\u201d Timsit told Blockworks.\n\nGood relations with Matter Labs and a desire to contribute to the open source development of the ZK Stack led them to take the next step.\n\nHyperchains share components of the ZK Stack, including a shared native bridge to the Ethereum mainnet and zkSync\u2019s trustless bridging mechanism, in which assets remain secured by Ethereum.\n\nIt will also benefit from zkSync\u2019s native account abstraction, which allows transactions fee payment in various cryptocurrencies, such as Cronos\u2019 token (CRO).\n\n\u201cWhen you look at legacy chains, it\u2019s very hard to migrate Ethereum assets, for example, to account abstraction enabled wallets,\u201d Timsit said. \u201cAnd so for us, starting by default with account abstraction is a way to take advantage of what this technology offers, better than what we can do on a chain which already has an ecosystem of wallets and tokens.\u201d\n\nCronos\u2019 zkEVM is expected to progress to mainnet in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nGrowing hyperchains\n\nA handful of other hyperchains are in development using the ZK Stack, notably GRVT, (pronounced \u201cgravity\u201d) a derivatives exchange, and Tradable, which is working on bringing private credit on-chain.\n\nTradable intends to have an institutional focused hyperchain, eventually forming a decentralized chain alongside other institutional partners, according to Omar Azhar, Matter Labs head of business development.\n\n\u201cI think what you might start seeing is app specific chains and then ecosystem specific chains,\u201d Azhar told Blockworks.\n\nMatter Labs sees the zkSync hyperchain as strictly a better option than app-specific chains in Cosmos, such as Cronos\u2019 earlier efforts, said Marco Cora, senior vice president of business and operations. That\u2019s because Cosmos chains generally must provide for their own validator set and security, and lack native token bridges to Ethereum.\n\n\u201cIf you are an appchain developer, why are you taking on these two extra projects that you shouldn\u2019t really focus on: building the bridge and bootstrapping the security?\u201d Cora told Blockworks.\n\nThe ZK Stack competes with other well-funded networks building zkEVM chains, including Polygon, whose Chain Development Kit (CDK) shares many of the same goals, and StarkWare\u2019s Starknet, the progenitor of STARK prover technology which both Polygon and zkSync have iterated upon.\n\nHyperchains can also serve the purpose of private blockchain frameworks such as Hyperledger or Corda, Cora said, but with all the benefits of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThey are technically highly scalable, but they practically don\u2019t scale. When you speak with most enterprises, they tell you this is way too expensive for what it is for me,\u201d he said.\n\nAside from cost considerations, there\u2019s the social coordination problem.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re Goldman Sachs, you don\u2019t want to join the Morgan Stanley Chain just because it\u2019s the Morgan Stanley Chain. If you\u2019re Fidelity, you don\u2019t want to join the BlackRock Chain just because it\u2019s the BlackRock Chain and so on and so forth,\u201d Cora said.\n\n\u201cBut if the sponsor of the chain\u2026forced himself to create a zero knowledge proof and to hand this proof to a third party \u2014 which is Ethereum \u2014 they now can claim a much higher degree of credible neutrality,\u201d he added. \u201cNow, this party cannot mess with the system.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Rainbow, a crypto wallet accessible via mobile and browser, rolled out a points-based program designed to reward current users and attract new ones.\n\nOn Dec. 11, Rainbow captured a snapshot of user activity on Ethereum, forming the basis for initial eligibility for the program. It has allocated at least 100 points to every Ethereum user as an incentive to explore its platform. Moreover, Rainbow is targeting users of popular web3 wallet MetaMask by providing a points bonus to those who have used MetaMask\u2019s swap service in the last year, with the amount based on their transaction volume.\n\nRainbow\u2019s points program resembles a strategy commonly known as a \u201cvampire attack.\u201d This approach is used by projects to attract users from competitors, usually by providing greater incentives. However, Rainbow stated that \u201cthis isn\u2019t a vampire attack. It\u2019s a fox hunt,\u201d referencing MetaMask\u2019s logo which resembles a fox.\n\nRainbow has also reserved a specific number of points for its current users and those who hold Rainbow NFTs, according to its announcement. Rainbow added that these points can be redeemed after the version 1.9.11 of its wallet application is released.\n\nThere\u2019s ongoing speculation that these Rainbow points might be exchangeable for future native tokens issued by Rainbow or make users eligible for an airdrop.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIn 2022, Rainbow raised an $18 million Series A led by Seven Seven Six, the VC fund set up by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.\n\nWhat are points?\n\nTypically in the crypto space, points are granted as incentives for activities such as participating in a network or interacting with a platform. These accumulated points can potentially serve as a basis for distributing crypto tokens through airdrops, a strategy that has been employed by several projects recently.\n\nFor example, Jito, a liquid staking protocol on the Solana blockchain, rewarded its users with points for staking SOL which made them eligible for an airdrop. Similarly, the NFT platform Blur distributed tokens to its users based on the number of points they had accumulated through their activities. Other projects that utilize a points system but have not yet announced any token giveaways include FriendTech, MarginFi and Orbiter."

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum's supply has been on a decline since its merge, burning tokens instead of creating new ones.\n\nLeading dApps like Uniswap are playing a major role in this deflationary strategy by burning significant amounts of ETH.\n\nBlackRock's potential entry into the Ethereum market via an ETF could bring institutional investors and boost its price.\n\nIn a financial twist, Ethereum has torched a staggering $2.5 billion worth of ETH since its merge in September 2022, steering the cryptocurrency into a deflationary course and triggering a remarkable dip in its supply to an 18-month low.\n\nThis article delves into the implications of this strategic move and explores how it aligns with Ethereum\u2019s evolving narrative.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Economic Shift\n\nUltrasound Money\u2019s careful analysis of Ethereum\u2019s recent financial data has uncovered a significant downturn in the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply. This decline, amounting to 309,663 ETH valued at approximately $686.2 million, marks a departure from its traditional inflationary trends, paving the way for potential enhancements to ETH\u2019s scarcity and value over time.\n\nUnlike the consistent creation of new ETH, Ethereum\u2019s supply has been deflationary, setting the stage for a potential enhancement of ETH\u2019s scarcity and value over time.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Continues Bleeding! Can ETH Price Still Achieve A New High This Year?\n\nThe Art of Token Elimination\n\nAt the heart of this transformation lies the burning of 1,195,238 ETH, worth around $2.65 billion. This strategic move involves the permanent removal of tokens from circulation, a process that plays a pivotal role in reducing the total supply. What\u2019s intriguing is that, despite the issuance of 885,581 ETH (approximately $1.96 billion), Ethereum\u2019s total supply has experienced a net decrease.\n\nThough Ethereum\u2019s total supply has hit its lowest point since the merger, standing at 120,211,380 ETH, its market capitalization remains robust at approximately $266.39 billion, solidifying Ethereum\u2019s formidable position within the crypto market.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s Strategy\n\nAn in-depth analysis of the ETH burning leaderboard unveils the leading contracts fueling this impactful ETH burn. Major decentralized applications (dApps) and services, such as Uniswap, Tether, and OpenSea, emerge as significant contributors to this deflationary strategy.\n\nUniswap, in particular, boasts a soaring transaction volume within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, torching an impressive $543.8 million across four contracts in the top 10. The cumulative value of ETH burned by these top 10 contracts tallies a staggering $1,039,762,113.68, underscoring the substantial impact of these strategic burns.\n\nBlackRock & Ethereum: The Impact\n\nAmidst Ethereum\u2019s transformative burn, another potential game-changer is on the horizon. Financial behemoth BlackRock, managing an eye-watering $8.5 trillion in assets, is maneuvering to secure approval for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). This strategic move could offer institutional investors an unprecedented gateway into the crypto market, especially Ethereum, renowned for powering applications beyond Bitcoin.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock Officially Files the S-1 Application for its Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nAlready triggering price surges with its interest in crypto, BlackRock\u2019s proposed ETF approval could inject new dynamics into Ethereum\u2019s current price hovering around $2,190. The financial giant envisions a bullish trajectory for Ethereum, predicting a minimum price of $3,100 in 2024 and a maximum of $8,000 by 2026, adding an extra layer of intrigue to Ethereum\u2019s evolving narrative."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nA dormant Ethereum (ETH) whale is back to life after more than three years of inactivity. According to insights shared by crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, the once dormant whale has deposited a total of 5,000 ETH worth approximately $11.3 million to Coinbase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTypically, when related deposits are made to crypto trading platforms, it is often a sign of a sell-off, and this appears to be what this whale is making a move at. According to market data, the Ethereum whale has been receiving funds since as early as 2017, when the price of Ethereum was still $60.\n\nA whale that has been dormant for nearly 3 years deposited 5,000 $ETH($11.3M) to #Coinbase 3 hours ago and currently has 20,398 $ETH($45.88M) left.\n\n\n\nThe whale received $ETH from #Bitfinex in 2017 when the price was ~$60.https://t.co/bSAWFB8XYe pic.twitter.com/WtvEdeNH9L \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 14, 2023\n\nThe last major inflow the whale received came about three years ago, when it bagged a total of 25,398.1 ETH. At the current market value of $2,281.29 per Ethereum, this fund is worth $57,940,431.549.\n\nAs the whale woke up, it conducted at least two test transactions featuring outbound 0.07 ETH and inbound 0.067 ETH, a move that might be intended to confirm it still has skin in the game. After the 5,000 ETH were moved, the whale is now left with 20,398 ETH worth approximately $45.88 million.\n\nReawakening dormant addresses now trendy\n\nWhile the reawakening of the Ethereum whale address shows more hidden influential wallets within the network, the move is arguably becoming a trend as other major cryptocurrencies also see reawakening whale addresses.\n\nAs reported earlier by U.Today, an ICO-era Ethereum address woke up in late November and went on a selling spree on Kraken Exchange. At the time, the whale sent 3,000 to Kraken for potential liquidation, leaving the 5,172 ETH worth approximately $10.7 million.\n\nBesides Ethereum, dormant Bitcoin (BTC) addresses are also prominently featured in these reawakening and liquidation trends."

        "content": "An early Ethereum ICO advisor has argued that fees were meant to be low on the network, questioning the lucrative gas fees users must now pay.\n\nThe Ethereum network has become notorious for its high fees during periods of peak user demand. Depending on the kind of transaction a user wants to execute, gas fees may spike as high as hundreds of dollars.\n\nHowever, an early Ethereum Foundation advisor, Steven Nerayoff, has questioned the current fee structure on the network. According to Nerayoff, fees on the network were originally meant to stay between $0.01 and $0.02, with a high bound of $0.5 allowed for only extremely complex transactions such as those involving sophisticated smart contracts.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe above figures appeared in the Ethereum ICO legal advisory documentation but are now far from the network\u2019s reality. Nerayoff argues that the derailment from cheap Ethereum fees is part of early investors\u2019 agenda to benefit \u201ca handful of big players.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that these rewards come in the form of higher ETH prices and rewards from mining (now staking activities), with those big players controlling a significant portion of the coin\u2019s supply. Nerayoff also questioned while fees were low on other blockchain protocols such as Solana, XRP, and Cardano.\n\n?The drive to push Ethereum, as Vitalik himself hints, often circles back to the lucrative 'gas fees'. When fees skyrocket, it's not the average user but a handful of big players who reap the rewards, especially if ownership & mining are as concentrated as suspected.\u2026 https://t.co/aeVq4zbzlk pic.twitter.com/C98gjEpsAH \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) December 12, 2023\n\nEthereum Aims to Scale via L2s\n\nWhile the Ethereum Foundation has revealed plans to improve transaction throughput on its base layer, the leading blockchain network has prioritized scaling through the layer-2 solutions. Over the past few years, several L2 networks, including Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and zkSync Era, have all launched in a bid to take the transaction load off the Ethereum base layer.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile it is still early, L2s have not had the desired results, with fees still significantly high on Ethereum. Newer-age networks, including Solana, aim to capitalize on Ethereum\u2019s weakness, with the older network now under pressure to scale faster or lose market share in the coming years."

        "content": "While many investors have rejoiced at Bitcoin\u2019s recent price upswings, others are betting that crypto\u2019s second fiddle, Ether, will actually be the big winner of 2024.\n\nWhile loud voices on Crypto Twitter have predicted the start of another bull run with Bitcoin\u2019s recent resurgence, JPMorgan analysts just wrote in a new report that the coin is overbought.\n\nThe report took aim at one of the biggest drivers of Bitcoin\u2019s recent rosy performance: the possibility that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve several spot Bitcoin ETFs in early January.\n\nSome have predicted that the approval of spot ETFs from TradFi firms like BlackRock and Fidelity will drive billions of dollars of inflows to Bitcoin, but JPMorgan said this optimism is misplaced.\n\nThe bank pointed to weak demand for existing spot Bitcoin ETFs in Europe and Canada as evidence that the investment vehicle could fail to garner significant traction in the U.S. Instead of bringing in fresh capital, spot ETFs are likely to instead draw from capital already invested in Bitcoin-backed vehicles such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Bitcoin futures ETFs, or Bitcoin mining companies.\n\nIf the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin fund, in particular, is allowed to become a spot ETF, existing investors could take profits and remove as much as $2.7 billion from the exchange-traded fund. That could severely dent prices, the report said.\n\n\u2018Recapture market share\u2019\n\nThe report also claims that the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which will cut the mining reward in half, has already been priced in and will not give the coin the boost some expect.\n\nOn the other hand, the JPMorgan report said Ether could outperform Bitcoin in 2024 owing in part to an upcoming upgrade to the underlying Ethereum blockchain dubbed EIP-4844 or proto-danksharding. The update is meant to increase throughput and decrease gas fees charged to those who execute transactions on the network.\n\n\u201cWe believe that next year Ethereum will reassert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nAs crypto prices have fallen over the past several months, funding dollars have dried up, and some VCs have cut the valuations of some of their biggest crypto bets by double digits. JPMorgan said it\u2019s seen a \u201creinvigoration\u201d of VC funding this quarter, although it still looks preliminary.\n\nStill, analysts think a revival in venture capital activity in the crypto industry could make a meaningful difference. \u201cTo the extent this improvement continues into the first quarter of 2024,\u201d the report continued, \u201cthat would represent a significant development that would herald in our opinion the end of the Crypto Winter.\u201d"

        "content": "SEC Delays Decision on Invesco Galaxy\u2019s Ethereum ETF Until February 2024\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on Invesco Galaxy\u2019s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) application, with a new decision to be made in 2024.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s latest filing, the decision, initially expected by December 23, 2023, has been delayed to allow the Commission more time to review the proposal. The new deadline is Feb. 6, 2024.\n\n\u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d wrote the SEC in the filing.\n\nThe SEC has designated the new deadline \u201cas the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.\u201d\n\nTrend of Ethereum ETF Applications\n\n\n\nIn September, Invesco and Galaxy Digital filed the form for the application of the spot Ethereum ETF. According to the S-1 registration statement, their ETF aims to \u201creflect the performance of the spot price of ether\u201d by holding units of the crypto with a separate custodian.\n\nAs of today, major financial institutions including BlackRock, ARK, Fidelity, VanEck and Hashdex have filed spot Ethereum ETF applications with the SEC, all pending final decisions.\n\nSEC Holds Meetings with Major Bitcoin ETF Issuers\n\n\n\nRecent filings indicated that the SEC has been meeting with major Bitcoin ETF issuers and including BlackRock, Grayscale, Franklin, and Fidelity. According to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, the meetings have brought renewed momentum to the discussion of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nWith the SEC set to make a decision on BlackRock\u2019s application by mid-January, these discussions are critical. The repeated engagements and strategic amendments to applications, such as BlackRock\u2019s inclusion of cash purchases for new fund shares, reflect a concerted effort to align with regulatory expectations.\n\nSeyffart suggests that the SEC might consider simultaneous approvals for multiple applications to ensure a level playing field among competitors. As the SEC\u2019s review process continues, the crypto community awaits what could be a landmark decision in the history of cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Ethereum has seen its deflationary status once again in the limelight as the network continues to see a significant decline in the number of ETH tokens in circulation. This comes on the back of the belief that the bull run and some other factors could help uphold this trend.\n\nMore ETH Goes Out Of Circulation\n\nAccording to data from Ultrasound Money, Ethereum has seen a decrease in its circulating supply in the last seven days, with over 14,160 ETH going out of circulation. This is a result of over 30,700 being burned during this period while only just over 16,500 ETH have been issued during this same timeframe.\n\nThis development continues a growing trend where the number of tokens being burned outpaces the number of tokens being issued. NewsBTC had reported earlier this month how over 106,000 ETH had been burned in the last 30 days (between November 4 and December 4). At the same time, only just over 70,000 ETH had been issued.\n\nThis deflationary trend has been attributed to the increasing number of validators exiting the Ethereum ecosystem. This trend is said to have begun at the start of October. Glassnode noted that the average number of validators exiting per day surged from 309 to 1018 validators per day at the start of October.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only contributing factor, as network activity on Ethereum has picked up significantly. According to data from Etherscan, the daily number of transactions on the network has stood over a million in the last seven days. This has caused a spike in gas fees, causing more ETH to be burned with the EIP-1559 protocol.\n\nETH price rises above $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum Deflationary Trend Expected To Continue\n\nIt is no coincidence that network activity on Ethereum has picked up as many continue to position themselves ahead of the imminent bull run, which is projected to kickstart in 2024. The recent surge in the trading volume of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum has also been a big factor. This is expected to continue once the bull market takes its full course.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the fact that more liquidity is expected to flow into the Ethereum ecosystem if the pending Ethereum Spot ETFs applications get approved. This would likely spark a further increase in the trading activity on the network as many will look to invest in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nETH investors will undoubtedly be delighted at the fact that the future trajectory of ETH looks bullish. One can expect the crypto token\u2019s value to rise as it continues to maintain this deflationary status. The less ETH in circulation, the more valuable it likely will be.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,270, up by over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image from Coinpedia, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum's price trajectory has been the subject of intense scrutiny and speculation, especially as it shows numerous reversal signs. Chart analysis suggests that the middle of January 2024 could be when Ethereum potentially hits the coveted $2,500 price mark. However, like any projection on the volatile market, this comes with significant caveats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA study of Ethereum's price performance, as depicted in the recent ETH/USDT chart, shows a robust uptrend with high momentum. This is corroborated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which, although retreating from overbought territory, remains strong, indicating sustained buying interest. The moving averages (MAs) \u2014 key indicators of long-term trends \u2014 demonstrate a bullish crossover, with shorter-term MAs traversing above longer-term ones, signaling ongoing upward momentum.\n\nSpecifically, the separation between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages is widening, a classic confirmation of a strong trend. However, this separation could also precede a long-term correction, particularly if it continues to expand without price consolidation. Additionally, descending volume accompanying recent price spikes raises concerns. Robust volume is a hallmark of sustainable price movements, and without it, the likelihood of a retracement increases.\n\nGiven these factors, mid-January 2024 stands out as a pivotal moment for Ethereum. Should the current momentum persist, and if volume picks up to validate the trend, reaching $2,500 is possible. This projection assumes that the current support levels hold firm and that buyer interest continues unabated.\n\nHowever, investors should heed the warning signs. The descending volume is the primary indicator to watch after as it may bring some issues and cause a drop of momentum in the future. Moreover, the potential for a long-term correction looms if the market perceives the price has outpaced fundamentals."

        "content": "Enterprise-grade blockchain platform Coti is set to transition protocol to become a scalable, privacy-focused layer-2 on Ethereum in 2024.\n\nAn announcement shared with Cointelegraph outlines how Coti will shift from a standalone protocol to an Ethereum layer 2 to bring its privacy features to the broader ecosystem. Coti v2\u2019s features a cryptographic approach called garbled circuits, which allows transactions to be processed without exposing sensitive information and data.\n\nDrawing from the field of multi-party computation (MPC), garbling protocols enable two or more parties to jointly compute a function while keeping both their inputs and intermediate variables private.\n\nRelated: Near taps Nym for metadata privacy, encryption services\n\nThe technique was initially introduced in the 1980s and has become an essential function in privacy-preserving technologies. The technology\u2019s primary advantage is preserving individual input privacy while allowing for multi-party computation.\n\nGarbling protocols are useful in situations that require confidential data to be included in a computation without revealing the information itself. Coti CEO Shahaf Bar-Geffen explains how the protocol prevents sensitive data from being broadcast to competitors, partners and clients transacting on its chain:\n\n\u201cSensitive data transmitted as public information on a blockchain is a bug, not a feature. This isn\u2019t tolerated in legacy business systems, so why should it be tolerated on-chain?\u201d\n\nBar-Geffen added that garbling protocols offer a unique approach in the context of Coti v2 by enabling transactions and smart contract executions where the details remain private between the involved parties:\n\n\u201cThis level of privacy is particularly important in decentralized finance applications where transaction confidentiality can be as critical as transaction integrity.\u201d\n\nThe CEO said that Coti will primarily focus on powering enterprise functions on a blockchain network in complete privacy. He claims that other platforms that focus on anonymity as a means to provide privacy tread the line in terms of regulatory oversight and are not necessarily effective at providing a compliant base for the wider ecosystem.\n\nRelated: Polygon 2.0: 2024 to see unified ZK-powered L2 chains\n\nCoti envisions its protocol catering to use cases requiring advanced privacy provisions in finance and healthcare. Its current protocol is aimed at enterprises and allows for managing blockchain-based products like custom-branded tokens, wallets, website integrations, and fiat on and off-ramps.\n\nCoti v2 is scheduled for a developer net release in the second quarter of 2024. Coti currently provides digital infrastructure for Web3 applications at a layer-1 level. This includes tools for wallets, tokens and payment modules. Its current layer-1 protocol has $31 million in total value locked.\n\nMagazine: Beyond crypto: Zero-knowledge proofs show potential from voting to finance"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have welcomed massive capital inflows, a move that can greatly impact the prices of both coins.\n\nAccording to insights shared by top market analyst, Ali Martinez, a total of $19.7 billion flowed into Bitcoin and Ethereum today. He posited that the last time this enormous capital entered the market was in December 2020, a period when the price of Bitcoin grew astronomically from $18,000 to $65,000 respectively.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are bullish at the moment. While Bitcoin is priced at $42,455.71, up 2.64% in 24 hours with a market cap of $830,279,319,394, Ethereum has grown 3.83% to $2,268.96 atop a market valuation of $272,882,507,263. With volatility high for both coins, trading volumes are considerably elevated.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDynamic Shift in Capital Inflows\n\nThe chart shared by the analyst showcased the interesting twist in the coins\u2019 flow balance. According to the chart, as of December 11, 2020, when the price of BTC was $18,079.31, the coin\u2019s positive 30-day Capital inflows came in at $22,244,699,464.21, while the Negative 30-day Capital Outflows stayed unchanged at $0.\n\nThe data at the time also showed that the BTC and Ethereum Net Position Change was $19,598,379,734.19, while the stablecoin Net Position Change was pegged at $2,646,319,730.02.\n\nShortly after the market recorded these figures, the price of Bitcoin rallied to the all-time high of $69,000, represented by the dark lines on the chart displayed by the analyst.\n\nAt the moment, similar statistics are visible with the Positive 30-day Capital Inflow coming in slightly higher at $22,343,091,198.64. Should history choose to repeat itself and BTC decide to trail a similar path as the 2020 cycle, achieving many of the conservative price targets above $100,000 by some market experts may be feasible.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBitcoin ETF Catalyst\n\nThis data insight comes at a time when the broader digital currency ecosystem is getting set for the emergence of a spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) product.\n\nWhile the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not given a green light to the numerous applications on its desk, the hype is high considering the positive communication between the regulator and some of the applicants.\n\nShould the SEC approve the product, it might usher in billions in capital into the market, a move that will also impact price surge."

Also, the Bitcoin (BTC) halving is already priced in and will likely have no further price impact, according to Chase Bank.\n\nThe report\u2019s prediction pivoted from general crypto-native sentiment, which has espoused bullish remarks amid hopes of billion-dollar inflows into BTC following the SEC\u2019s potential nod.\n\nInstead, JPMorgan opined that successfully launching spot BTC ETFs would divert capital from existing Bitcoin-based products like futures ETFs, mining operations, and Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nThe heavyweight bank also said GBTC\u2019s conversion into a spot ETF could induce $2.7 billion worth of sell pressure from long-standing Grayscale customer looking to cash in early on their faith in the company.\n\nVeChain CEO Sunny Lu said crypto regulations would likely impact the markets more than BTC\u2019s halving. However, Lu argued that an ETF decision should not be understated.\n\nThe impact regulation is having on the market is becoming more significant than the impact of Bitcoin halving.

The bank supported this assertion by citing forthcoming technological upgrades to reduce gas fees and boost throughput.\n\nThe upgrades are part of EIP-4844, an Ethereum improvement proposal focused on proto-danksharding.\n\nWe believe that next year Ethereum will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem. JPMorgan Analysts\n\nJPMorgan researchers shared these thoughts weeks before January 2024, when some believe the SEC could approve the first batch of spot Bitcoin ETFs.

        "content": "Alongside their \u201ccautious\u201d outlook of the industry in the coming year, JP Morgan has predicted that Ethereum (ETH) will outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in 2024. Moreover, they have stated the forecast despite the incoming halving event that will decrease the number of total Bitcoin tokens in circulation.\n\nUltimately, JP Morgan has highlighted \u201cexcessive optimism,\u201d as working against Bitcoin in the coming year. Additionally, analysts at the institution have noted the aforementioned halving event is \u201clargely priced in\u201d to the current value of the asset. Therefore, they are not expecting immense gains over the next year.\n\nJUST IN: JPMorgan says Ethereum will outperform #Bitcoin in 2024. December 14, 2023\n\nAlso Read: How Many Times Bitcoin Was Declared Dead in 2023?\n\nJP Morgan Unenthusiastic About Bitcoin\u2019s Prospect in 2024?\n\nFor much of 2022 and the early parts of the subsequent year, Bitcoin struggled in the mainstream. Indeed, the entire industry endured a crypto winter that saw a host of concerns regarding its ability to bounce back. Now, with just one month before 2024 arises, the excitement around the asset has never been higher.\n\nAnticipation over a potential Spot Bitcoin ETF approval and the upcoming halving have driven elation over its potential. However, one bank is not as bullish on crypto\u2019s overall positive performance throughout next year. JP Morgan has stated that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nAlso Read: JP Morgan Predicts S&P 500 To Crash 25%: Here\u2019s When\n\nThe bank released an outlook on the coming year that they have called \u201ccautious\u201d considering a host of factors. Specifically, they have cited the potential for over-excitement to ultimately work against Bitcoin. Subsequently, this led the asset to be overbought in a market that has already factored in the upcoming halving event.\n\nJP Morgan highlighted how the halving event will affect miners. Indeed, they noted that based on current hash rates and Bitcoin mining difficulties, production costs should double. Additionally, they have predicted a 20% decline in the hash rate, leading miners with excessive costs to exit the market altogether. Moreover, they stated that expectations for capital inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETF products are exaggerated.\n\nConversely, they discussed Ethereum\u2019s upcoming EIP-4844 \u201cProto-dank sharding\u201d upgrade. They discussed its potential impact on the asset\u2019s performance over the coming year especially. Yet, they still have expressed their concerns over centralized staking on the Ethereum network. If JP Morgan is correct regarding its Bitcoin concerns, the asset could greatly struggle to live up to the hype."

        "content": "On-chain data shows Ethereum has successfully found a rebound at a major support zone, a positive sign for the asset\u2019s exploration at higher levels.\n\nEthereum Recently Made A Retest Of A Strong On-Chain Support Zone\n\nIn terms of on-chain analysis, the potential of any particular price range to act as support or resistance lies in the total number of investors who bought their coins inside said price range.\n\nThe reason behind that is the holders are more likely to react whenever the price retests their cost basis or acquisition price, which is obviously an important level to them since it can flip their profit-loss situation.\n\nA single holder showing such a reaction won\u2019t cause any effects on the market, naturally, but if a large number of investors share their cost basis inside a tight range, the asset\u2019s retest of the range could perhaps produce a sizeable reaction.\n\nHence, the larger the concentration of investors inside a particular range, the higher the ability of said range to act as resistance/support. Analyst Ali shared this chart recently in an X post that showed how the various Ethereum price ranges looked like in terms of the amount of addresses who acquired their coins at them at the time of the post:\n\nThe various on-chain support and resistance levels | Source: @ali_charts on X\n\nFrom the graph, it\u2019s apparent that the $1,934 to $2,160 range is the Ethereum range that hosts the cost basis of the most amount of addresses. At the time Ali had made the post, Ethereum was retesting this range.\n\nNow, since this range has such a high number of investors, a retest of it is probable to cause some reaction on the ETH price. But what kind of reaction would it be, support or resistance?\n\nWhat decides this is the direction the price is retesting from. If the retest is from above, that is, these investors had been in profit just before the retest, then the market could feel some support.\n\nThis is because the holders might think this same price range could be profitable again in the future, so they might decide to participate in some accumulation at it.\n\nSimilarly, a retest from below could end up leading to resistance for Ethereum, as the investors might fear the asset dropping once more, so they could become more likely to sell.\n\nTherefore, this huge range holding the cost basis of 5.85 million addresses should have acted as support for Ethereum during its latest retest. And indeed, since the retest, the asset has successfully found a rebound, as it has shot up towards higher levels.\n\nAs is visible in the chart, the ranges ahead up to the asset\u2019s all-time high are all relatively thin with investors. This means that, thanks to the large support basis below, ETH shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble traversing through these levels, at least in theory.\n\nETH Price\n\nSince finding the rebound at the support range, Ethereum has climbed towards the $2,300 level.\n\nLooks like ETH has been going up during the last couple of days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Bastian Riccardi on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, IntoTheBlock.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Ether Price: Will Ethereum (ETH) Go Back Up? - CoinGape",
        "content": "This week has seen significant volatility in the Ethereum price (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market value. For the first time in the previous week, the decline caused the coin\u2019s price to drop below $2,300, and it has since been trending down.\n\nEven though the overall crypto market is beginning to recover a little, it is still unclear what caused the collapse. Given that investors are closely monitoring economic indicators, there are several potential explanations for this decline. Let\u2019s dive deep into the possible causes of the latest sell-off in the cryptocurrency market and explore how Ethereum\u2019s price can make a recovery.\n\nCrypto Market Fall: An Overview\n\nFor the majority of cryptocurrencies, 2024 got off to a good start. Most cryptocurrency tokens started recording from December 2023 and continued their price rally in the first month of this year. Nonetheless, in comparison to their all-time highs, cryptocurrency prices are still trading at bargain.\n\nMoreover, the first half of 2023 has seen a wild ride in the price of cryptocurrencies. However, the last part of the latter half of the 2023 showed a promising signs for an upcoming bull market in 2024. But the question, will cryptocurrencies soar to new heights and fully overcome their losses in 2024?, remains on the back of the mind for all crypto investors.\n\nWhy is the Ethereum Price Falling?\n\nBefore going to the questions raised above, the majority of crypto enthusiasts want to know the reason behind the fall in Ethereum\u2019s price. This question becomes the talk of the town. Moving forward to the exact reason, several crypto-specific as well as other factors led to the decline in Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nThe entire crypto market is in red as of January 2024. Contrary to what investors believed, the Bitcoin price dropped by 20% after Bitcoin ETF approval. The market price trend movements of Bitcoin always have a direct impact on the price movements of altcoins, including Ethereum.\n\nAdding to the ongoing bear price trends in the market, Celsius moved massive ETH holdings to exchanges, further causing the Ethereum price to drop. Around $35 million worth of ETH was moved from Celsius staking wallets to crypto exchange platforms like Coinbase and FalconX. This is also one of the major reasons behind the ongoing price drop of Ethereum.\n\nWill Ethereum Price Make A Recovery?\n\n\u201cWill Ethereum recover?\u201d is a question that is currently making waves. There are numerous expert views present on the topic. But no one has the exact idea about the same. However, it depends on several factors.\n\nThe precise course of Ethereum\u2019s recovery is still difficult to predict, though, since different projections point to both possible ups and downs in the near future. The comeback of Ethereum is dependent on a number of factors, including general economic conditions, technological developments, and market patterns. After the fall in the price of Ethereum, a lot of analysts are still positive about the cryptocurrencies long-term prospects.\n\nWhat Factors Can Drive Ethereum\u2019s Price Up?\n\nAs we all know, Ethereum is a utility token. So, Ethereum\u2019s price is affected by a mix of general and crypto-specific factors in addition to the price of Bitcoin and other macroeconomic variables.\n\nHowever, the price of Ethereum is largely determined by supply and demand. Since ETH is now a deflationary utility token, its price may rise in the coming months due to growing scarcity and rising demand.\n\nEther Price Prediction: Will Ethereum Reach $10,000?\n\nEthereum is well-known in the cryptocurrency world and is one of the top platforms for smart contracts and decentralized apps. Investors are curious as to whether Ethereum can ever hit the incredible $10,000 price threshold.\n\nTherefore, although it is appealing to think that Ethereum might hit $10,000 in 2024, a realistic study indicates that this is a very unlikely possibility. The necessary price increase, the market capitalization at the moment, and the aftermath of the previous bear market provide formidable obstacles for Ethereum to clear in a short amount of time. Investors should use caution when making price projections and take into account the market\u2019s inherent volatility and unpredictability.\n\nIf we look at the price of Ethereum over the previous five years, it has gone through significant fluctuations. The ups and downs include the record bull run of 2017 and the bear market that followed in 2018. By going through the data, you can find out that the cryptocurrency has the potential to appreciate in value significantly, as evidenced by its recent surge in 2021. However, there is always a chance that Ethereum will hit $10,000 at some point in the future, and it is very difficult to believe that this will happen within the next six months or in 2024.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ethereum bull run clearly shows that the price of ETH is maintaining above-significant support levels and breaking through important resistance zones. However, how the market responds to these technical indications will determine the course of future price movements. Will Ethereum recover and reach $10,000? might have a positive response if it manages to breach the resistance encompassed by the YTD high. Investors must, however, keep a careful eye on these levels because they are a guide, not a magic bullet."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently garnered significant attention after experiencing a substantial rally over the past month. However, this surge encountered a hurdle around the $2,100 mark last Friday, creating a triple-top pattern and prompting a reversal in its upward trajectory.\n\nDespite this temporary setback, the Ethereum market has witnessed a noteworthy trend in institutional interest, a phenomenon that has become more pronounced in the month of November 2023. According to Woominkyu, an analyst at Cryptoquant, a leading crypto analytics firm, institutional holdings of Ethereum have seen an unprecedented surge. This surge in institutional interest coincides with Ethereum\u2019s price stabilization in the range of $1,800 to $1,900.\n\nWoominkyu highlighted this development in a post, stating, \u201cThe surge in institutional Ethereum holdings signals a growing interest from institutional investors. It reflects their strong belief in Ethereum\u2019s long-term value and the market\u2019s potential for growth.\u201d\n\nInstitutional investors appear drawn to Ethereum not only due to its recent price stability and potential approval of a spot ETF but also because of the technical advancements, including the much-anticipated Ethereum 2.0 upgrades and enhanced smart contract functionalities.\n\nNotably, recent reports reveal that investors have migrated over $30 million in ether and stablecoins to Blast, a new Ethereum Layer 2 network. This influx underscores the growing demand for Layer 2 solutions that address speed, cost, and scalability issues. The protocol natively participates in Ethereum staking, with staking yields passed back to users and decentralized applications on the Layer 2 network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, insights from onchain analytics firm Glassnode further suggest that whales, particularly addresses with 10,000 or more Ethereum, have been on an accumulation spree for nine consecutive days\u2014a trend not witnessed in the past nine months. Consistent buying pressure among whales is often interpreted as a bullish signal for Ethereum\u2019s future price action.\n\nNotably, Ali Martinez, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, recently emphasized Ethereum\u2019s recent achievement in surpassing the crucial resistance zone spanning from $1,982 to $2,044. According to him, this breakthrough led to a notable acquisition, with 1.67 million wallets collectively securing an impressive 38.7 million ETH. According to him, this achievement, coupled with minimal resistance ahead and solid support below, positions Ethereum favourably to reach new yearly highs.\n\nThat said, Ethereum\u2019s resilience in the face of market fluctuations, coupled with growing support for Layer 2 solutions, positions Ethereum for continued growth and adoption, which could positively impact price in the coming months. Ether was trading at $2,292 at press time after a 0.66% drop over the past 24 hours."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as JPMorgan Says ETH Will Outperform BTC in 2024 \u2013 Can ETH Reach $100,000?\n\nThe Ethereum price has surged by 5.5% today, with the coin moving to $2,298 in the context of a market that has gained by the same percentage in the past 24 hours.\n\nETH\u2019s performance today also comes as JPMorgan analysts predict that the altcoin could outperform Bitcoin (BTC) next year, helped along by the incoming EIP-4844 upgrade that will enable Protodanksharding and its scaling upgrades for layer-two networks.\n\nETH is also up by 13% in the last 30 days, with the altcoin sitting on a 73% rise in the past year.\n\nAnd with most analysts predicting a fully fledged bull market in 2024, today\u2019s gains may be only the tip of a very large iceberg.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as JPMorgan Says ETH Will Outperform BTC in 2024 \u2013 Can ETH Reach $100,000?\n\n\n\nNow looks like a very good time to reenter the ETH market, given that the coin\u2019s indicators point towards incoming gains.\n\nNot only is its 30-day average (yellow) rising well beyond its 200-day (blue), but the coin\u2019s RSI (purple) has just past the 60 level, signalling rising buying pressure.\n\nAs such, ETH not only has growing momentum, but also has space for further gains in the coming weeks, before it enters overbought territory.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out that the alt\u2019s support level (green) has risen consistently in the past couple of months, resisting all but the most minor of losses.\n\nThis sits well with ETH\u2019s trading volume, which at $19 billion makes it the most heavily traded non-stablecoin cryptocurrency save for Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nAnd as noted above, some analysts suspect that ETH could post bigger percentage gains in 2024 than even BTC, with JPMorgan\u2019s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou writing in a note to investors yesterday that the arrival of Protodanksharding could be a big factor in improving the strength of ETH\u2019s fundamentals.\n\nJP Morgan: Ether has the potential to outperform Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2024 due to the EIP-4844 upgrade \"Protodanksharding.\" JP Morgan believes the likelihood of a Bitcoin ETF being approved and the halving event has already been factored into Bitcoin's price \u2014 0xNgaos (@0xNgaos) December 14, 2023\n\nSuch fundamentals remain very strong as they already are, with the Ethereum blockchain accounting for more than 50% of the entire sector\u2019s total value locked in.\n\nEthereum has also enjoyed some bullish adoption news this year, with PayPal launching an Ethereum-based stablecoin and Coinbase launch its own layer-two network for Ethereum.\n\nThis means that the arrival of Protodanksharding \u2013 which will allow layer-two networks to process multiple transactions in parallel \u2013 will only boost the Ethereum price even further.\n\nIt could reach $3,000 by the first few months of the year, before topping its current ATH \u2013 at $4,878 \u2013 during the second half of 2024.\n\nOther Fundamentally Strong Altcoins\n\n\n\nBecause ETH is such an established coin, many traders may also be inclined to diversify some of their portfolios into smaller cap alts, which may have the potential to outpace the market next year.\n\nPresale tokens have been a good source of such outsized gains this year, with the biggest often creating momentum before they list on exchanges.\n\nAnd one ongoing presale with good momentum right now is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), a stake-to-mine platform that has raised over $5.2 million in its sale.\n\n#Tether freezes 41 wallets linked to OFAC's SDN List, taking precautionary measures. \ud83d\udd12 CEO Paolo Ardoino emphasizes a safer #Stablecoin ecosystem.

        "title": "Liquid Collective pitches efficiency standards for Ethereum validators - Blockworks",
        "content": "An Ethereum liquid staking protocol for institutions says it\u2019s now holding those who run its network to new standards and hopes others will follow suit \u2014 perhaps boosting yield and attracting more users along the way.\n\nLiquid Collective, developed by Delaware-registered blockchain startup Alluvial Finance and launched earlier this year, introduced the series of service level agreements (SLAs) last week.\n\nThese new standards will require Liquid Collective node operators, which include Coinbase Cloud, Figment and Staked, to perform in the top 50th percentile of ETH staking providers with 100 nodes or more, as ranked by Rated Network\u2019s validator dashboard.\n\nIf they fall out of the top half, those who own the nodes must reimburse Liquid Collective for the revenue they missed due to their inefficiencies \u2014 effectively penalizing them until they maximize their yield.\n\nStaking to earn yield, in Ethereum\u2019s case, is the process of locking crypto in a proof of stake network to participate in consensus. This involves managing software to validate transactions and generally ensuring the blockchain functions well.\n\nStaking rewards are designed to incentivize validators to act honestly. Operate in bad faith, say by pushing erroneous transactions, and face slashing. This removes validators from consensus and results in lost capital, usually 1 ETH ($2,200) per event, although penalties can be higher if misbehavior continues.\n\nOn Ethereum, a solo staker must deposit 32 ETH ($69,600) to join the network as a validator. Ethereum validators who stake directly to the chain can currently earn an annualized yield of 4%, which the network pays out in ETH as block rewards (some additional yield can be gleaned by adopting MEV boost relays).\n\nLikewise, if the machine running the Ethereum node is slow and unreliable, or the internet connection is poor, that node may miss out on chances to participate in consensus and ultimately lose rewards, which can convert to lower overall yield.\n\nLoading Tweet.. Liquid Collective has published an open source methodology showing how it grades validator performance\n\nUsers who don\u2019t want to maintain their own nodes can opt for a staking service, like the ones Coinbase and Kraken offer, which manage Ethereum validators on their behalf and forward rewards minus a cut.\n\nProtocols like Lido, Rocket Pool and Liquid Collective go one step further: users stake ETH in return for a different cryptocurrency, a liquid staking token (LST), as a receipt.\n\nMany liquid staking services allow smaller ETH stakes in return for scaled rewards, with Rocket Pool\u2019s mini-pools accepting stakes of 8 ETH ($17,400), for instance.\n\nParticipants in the liquid staking protocols \u2014 often third-party partners \u2014 then similarly handle the Ethereum nodes instead of the user, and charge fees for the trouble. Coinbase and Kraken also accept partial stakes.\n\nLSTs such as Lido\u2019s, Rocket Pool\u2019s and Liquid Collective\u2019s can then be traded on crypto exchanges, used as collateral for loans and even staked again in liquidity pools across DeFi to earn additional yield. All this turns what would have been an illiquid ETH stake, subject to days-long withdrawal periods, into a more liquid digital asset.\n\nThere\u2019s about $80 million staked in Liquid Collective, per DeFiLlama, much less than industry leader Lido\u2019s $22 billion. All Liquid Collective stakers and operators must pass know-your-customer and anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) checks, and the platform has 69 unique depositors compared to Lido\u2019s 200,000 and Rocket Pool\u2019s 7,900.\n\nThere are now one million Ethereum validators and about 40% are managed by either Lido or Coinbase. The ETH staked with Lido represents one-third of all ether staked and nearly 8% of the entire circulating supply.\n\nThe growing ETH supply within Lido has become a point of contention over centralization of risk and security concerns.\n\nMake validators better and yield will follow\n\nDue to their fees, liquid staking protocols offer slightly lower yield than the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe two biggest liquid staking protocols, Lido and Rocket Pool, at the moment pay annual percentage rates of 3.93% and 3.57%, respectively. Liquid Collective doesn\u2019t yet publish its yield data.\n\nAs for fees, Lido charges 10%, Rocket Pool takes 14% and Liquid Collective 15%.\n\nWith margins so thin, protocols compete to offer the highest yield possible (and the most attractive tokenomics). Part of that means ensuring operators keep their nodes, which typically run on dedicated servers, operating as efficiently as possible \u2014 hence Liquid Collective\u2019s push to contractually obligate its own maintainers to meet certain service level standards.\n\nAfter all, more rewards for validators converts to more rewards for end users. There have been about 400 slashing events in total since Ethereum\u2019s beacon chain went live three years ago. At 1 ETH each, that works out to be nearly $900,000 in crypto lost due to slashing, at current prices.\n\nMore specific to liquid staking, the largest protocol Lido Finance faced a 20 ETH ($43,500) penalty in October after 20 of its nodes, operated by LaunchNodes, were slashed due to \u201cnon-optimal fallback procedures during datacenter connectivity issues.\u201d In other words, its infrastructure wasn\u2019t properly prepared to handle sudden downtime.\n\nLoading Tweet.. Liquid Collective wants to be the liquid staking protocol of choice for entities with strict KYC/AML requirements\n\nIt is important to note that all three node operators on Liquid Collective are either investors in its creator Alluvial, in the case of Figment, or are owned by a company that has invested in Alluvial, as with Staked and Kraken. Coinbase Ventures similarly invested in Alluvial while its sister organization, Coinbase Cloud, runs nodes on Alluvial\u2019s network.\n\nOther backers include Brevan Howard, Variant and enterprise-grade staking provider Kiln, the latter of which led the build of Liquid Collective\u2019s Ethereum platform. Alluvial itself was co-founded by the former CTO of Kiln alongside two former executives from Figment and Index Cooperative\u2019s DAO.\n\nThe scope of the agreement also only applies to the validators those companies run for Liquid Collective. So, Ethereum nodes maintained by Coinbase Cloud, Figment and Staked in other contexts won\u2019t have to stick to the new standards.\n\nLiquid Collective measures node performance with a system developed by Rated, RAVER, which determines and compares validator health by analyzing whether they maximize consensus layer rewards over time.\n\n(At time of writing, the RAVER system rates Lido\u2019s node effectiveness at 97.9% \u2014 which is in the top 45% percentile and above Liquid Collective\u2019s new benchmarks. Rocket Pool, meanwhile, is in the bottom 10th percentile with 94.7% effectiveness. Liquid Collective doesn\u2019t yet have an effectiveness rating.)\n\n\u201cTo perform in the top 50th percentile, staking providers that operate validators must \u2018beat the competition\u2019 by having better-performing infrastructure,\u201d Mara Schmiedt, CEO of Alluvial, told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about being better than average; it\u2019s about guaranteeing node operators meet the high standards that enterprise clients are looking for when joining the space,\u201d she said. The benchmark will be reviewed on a three-month rolling basis by Liquid Collective to make necessary adjustments based on performance analysis and risk metrics.\n\nOther staking protocols can also adopt Liquid Collective\u2019s standards if they so wish. The firm is betting that its open source methodology for ranking nodes might inspire the wider Ethereum ecosystem to set its own standards, which could help bring more of traditional finance over to crypto.\n\n\u201cIn the competitive landscape of securing Ethereum, it\u2019s imperative for stakers to be confident in the proficiency of their chosen service providers,\u201d she said. \u201cEstablishing SLAs is more than just a formality; it presents a guarantee of excellence and reliability for the entire ecosystem.\u201d\n\nSLAs may not minimize risk \u2014 which institutions avoid\n\nThe pseudonymous adcv, a Lido DAO contributor, expressed it was great that research and new ideas are being shared in the liquid staking space. But they remain cautious about the roles SLAs like Liquid Collective\u2019s will play moving forward.\n\n\u201cThe clear main concern for any regulated institution is to shield their customers from risks, and the two major risks in liquid staking are counterparty exposure and liquidity risk,\u201d adcv told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cI believe the fundamental reason institutions have overwhelmingly chosen [Lido\u2019s] stETH \u2014 open source staking middleware \u2014 to be the leading enterprise-grade staking solution is because it deals with both of these issues.\u201d\n\nAdcv warned that centralization in liquid staking protocols could concentrate counterparty exposure, a big no-no in terms of risk and something that SLAs alone may not sufficiently mitigate.\n\n\u201cI am not convinced that SLAs will overcome these basic needs,\u201d they said.\n\nAlluvial\u2019s Schmiedt, on the other hand, said institutions evaluating liquid staking protocols must also consider whether providers meet their quality and compliance needs. That\u2019s part of identifying all risk vectors, which includes centralization of stake in a single protocol.\n\n\u201cWhile existing solutions like stETH are great for crypto-native retail investors, they do not meet the needs of all market participants,\u201d she said, adding that Liquid Collective\u2019s products are tailored to meet the needs of certain customer segments.\n\nDavid Canellis contributed reporting.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Native Bitcoin Staking on Ethereum and Solana Could Soon Be a Reality - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere are a few essential truths that govern accepted thinking about blockchain networks. One such truth is that, without compromises like wrapped tokens and blockchain bridges, proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum and proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin are tantamount to water and oil: They just don\u2019t mix.\n\nNow, a new startup led by a Stanford professor and a former Dolby engineer is attempting to disprove that. Babylon, a project that seeks to allow users to stake Bitcoin (BTC) to validate nodes on a variety of proof-of-stake networks including Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon, is already well on its way to achieving its improbable-sounding goal.\n\nThe company just raised an $18 million funding round co-led by Polychain Capital and Hack VC, with participation from funds including Framework Ventures, Polygon Ventures, OKX Ventures, and Castle Island Ventures. It is also in ongoing conversations with multiple blockchain networks about integrating its services, including Polygon, a Polygon Labs spokesperson confirmed to Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow could it be possible, even theoretically, for someone to stake BTC\u2014actual BTC, not a wrapped token that utilizes a blockchain bridge\u2014on a proof-of-stake network? Proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum utilize smart contracts to govern the staking process, which rewards users who deposit a certain amount of ETH with rewards accrued over time.\n\nIn return, these ETH deposits are used to validate transactions on the Ethereum network. The entire staking process represents an intricate web of if/then conditions executed automatically by a smart contract.\n\nSmart contracts, however, are not natively supported on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014but Babylon says it\u2019s found a workaround.\n\nThe solution relies in part on Bitcoin\u2019s \u201ctime lock\u201d mechanism, which allows users to deposit a certain amount of BTC for a certain period, then withdraw it after that period without depending on a third party. But Babylon also had to find a way to get around the pesky smart contract problem.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge for staking is that the stake is a collateral,\u201d David Tse, an engineering professor at Stanford who co-founded Babylon, told Decrypt. \u201cIn other words, I have to be able to slash the Bitcoin when the validator on the proof-of-stake chain is doing something bad.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTypically, a smart contract would either release collateralized funds to a staker if all conditions were met, or burn (or slash) those funds if they hadn\u2019t been. Tse says his team has been able to replicate that process on the Bitcoin network without smart contracts.\n\n\u201cWe came up with a way to use the existing Bitcoin scripting language to effect the slashing,\u201d Tse said. \u201cThat is the main innovation of the project.\u201d\n\nIf Tse and his team have in fact gotten this right\u2014he says they still have a bit of final tweaking to do on the technology\u2014then the potential upside is enormous.\n\nProof-of-stake blockchains of all sorts could tap into the $838 billion worth of incredibly secure Bitcoin already in circulation to validate their transactions. That innovation would be an all-but-certain path to deflation for any proof-of-stake network, that would no longer have to issue so many new tokens in order to incentivize validation.\n\n\u201cThe Cosmos hub is paying about 10%\u2014inflating the token 10%\u2014to pay for Cosmos\u2019 security,\u201d Tse said, giving an example. \u201cBy bringing in Bitcoin, it can potentially lower the cost of security quite a bit, because Bitcoin is a much larger supply of capital.\u201d\n\nBabylon won\u2019t be able to provide its technology to any given proof-of-stake blockchain ecosystem until that blockchain\u2019s governance gives consent. So, at the moment, the company\u2019s vision is still theoretical.\n\nBut Babylon is, as mentioned above, currently in serious conversations with major proof-of-stake blockchains like Polygon\u2014and also has already received the blessing of industry leaders including Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal.\n\n\u201cBabylon's vision aligns with our commitment to fostering decentralized ecosystems by offering diverse options for communities to seamlessly choose from,\u201d Nailwal said in a statement. \u201cWe are enthusiastic about the positive impact this collaboration will bring to the wider blockchain community.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf (or when) proof-of-stake networks like Polygon begin adopting Babylon\u2019s novel technology, they may create new parameters for what it means to stake BTC on their chain as opposed to the network\u2019s native token.\n\nEthereum, for example, may not require the minimum amount of BTC needed to stake on the network to equal 32 ETH, the system\u2019s current requirement. It might also elect to offer a lower rewards return rate for BTC stakers.\n\nEven if proof-of-stake networks that eventually work with Babylon opt to make such choices, though, the demand for receiving any sort of passive, guaranteed return on Bitcoin will likely be immensely attractive to BTC holders around the world.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

The regulatory body has accused the exchange of operating an unlawful platform and listing multiple securities tokens. The financial regulator has also filed similar lawsuits against rivals like Binance, Kraken, and others.\n\nHowever, Coinbase has contested these allegations. Instead, it advocated for the SEC to establish specific regulations tailored to the emerging industry.\n\nCoinbase highlights these issues in its statement, noting how this has impacted its relationship with asset issuers and the crypto community. It said:\n\n\u201cWe recognize the hesitancy among some asset issuers and members of the crypto community to engage with US exchanges due to the evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape in the United States.\u201d\n\nDue to this, the platform launched an international arm in May to \u201coffer a trusted and compliant non-US spot market for those participants.\n\nSince its launch, Coinbase International has grown substantially, processing nearly $10 billion in perpetual futures trading volume in Q3 alone and adding over 100 institutional clients to its platform."

        "title": "Ethereum Rising User Base Boosts Revenue Projections: Predicted To Double To $5 Billion - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitwise Invest, an investment firm specializing in the crypto space, recently unveiled its anticipated crypto predictions for 2024.\n\nThese projections provide a glimpse into the future of the cryptocurrency industry, highlighting major milestones and potential breakthroughs for the largest cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH), and exchanges like Coinbase.\n\nBitcoin Predicted To Smash Records\n\nBitwise\u2019s first prediction suggests that Bitcoin will surpass previous records and trade above $80,000, setting a new all-time high. The firm attributes this bullish outlook to two key catalysts: the imminent launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) early in 2024 and the anticipated halving of new Bitcoin supply by the end of April.\n\nFurthermore, Bitwise expects the spot Bitcoin ETFs to be approved and to collectively become the most successful ETF launch in history.\n\nInterestingly, Bitwise also forecasts that Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, will witness its revenue double, surpassing Wall Street expectations by at least 10 times.\n\nThe firm points out that Coinbase\u2019s trading volumes typically surge during bull markets, and they anticipate a similar trend in 2024. Additionally, Bitwise highlights Coinbase\u2019s successful launch of various new products that have gained traction in the market.\n\nOn the other hand, the investment firm predicts that more money will settle using stablecoins compared to traditional payment giant Visa. Bitwise highlights stablecoins as one of crypto\u2019s \u201ckiller apps\u201d and notes their remarkable growth from virtually zero to a $137 billion market in just four years. Bitwise anticipates 2024 to be another significant year for stablecoin expansion.\n\nEthereum Set For Major Breakthrough\n\nBitwise expects Ethereum\u2019s revenue to more than double from $2.3 billion in 2023 to $5 billion in 2024. The firm attributes this growth to the increasing number of users flocking to crypto applications. Bitwise emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s potential as one of the fastest-growing large-scale tech platforms globally.\n\nFurthermore, Bitwise anticipates a major upgrade to Ethereum, labeled EIP-4844, which could reduce average transaction costs to below $0.01. This significant cost reduction is expected to pave the way for mainstream adoption and the development of groundbreaking applications within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nBitwise\u2019s bonus prediction suggests that by the end of 2024, one in four financial advisors will allocate funds to cryptocurrencies in their clients\u2019 accounts. The firm foresees increased adoption by financial advisors once Bitcoin becomes easily accessible and mainstream.\n\nIn summary, Bitwise Invest\u2019s crypto predictions for 2024 paint an exciting future for the cryptocurrency market. With expectations of a new all-time high for Bitcoin, the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and revenue growth for industry giants like Coinbase and Ethereum, the crypto space is poised for significant advancements in the coming years.\n\nAs of the current update, ETH is trading at $2,200, reflecting a 1.4% increase over the past 24 hours. This positive movement follows a similar trend set by BTC. However, Ethereum has experienced a slight decline of 2.4% in the past seven days.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "An analysis of Ethereum\u2019s financial information has shown that an astronomical $2.5 billion worth of ETH has been burned since the Merge Event in September of 2022. Indeed, Ultrasound Money shows that the supply of Ethereum is at an 18-month low, currently standing at 309,663 ETH.\n\nThe development shows a clear contrast to the inflation that Ethereum had previously observed. Indeed, the asset has now shown a deflationary shift due to the 1,195,238 ETH that has been burned. Moreover, that permanent reduction in supply will have a long-term positive impact on the asset\u2019s value.\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nAlso Read: Will Ethereum Flip Bitcoin in 2024? VanEck Weighs In\n\nEthereum Supply Drops by 1 Million ETH Since Merge\n\nThroughout the entire history of the digital asset sector, Bitcoin has reigned supreme. However, the rising prominence of Ethereum has caused it to be the only true competitor within the space. Moreover, the landmark merge event had been a massive moment in the increased prominence of the asset. Now, the fruits of that development are starting to take shape.\n\nSpecifically, recent observation has shown that Ethereum is $2.5 billion worth of ETH burned since that merge event in 2022. Altogether, the event has caused a net decrease in overall supply. That decrease has still been present despite the issuance of $1.86 billion worth of the digital asset.\n\nSource: Bitcoinist\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Whale Makes $78 Million Profit After Investing $11 Million\n\nCurrently, Ethereum\u2019s total supply is at its lowest point since that Merge event, with 120,211,380 ETH. Moreover, that supply equates to a market cap for the asset that is still north of $266 billion. Subsequently, it further reiterates the place Ethereum holds in the greater digital asset market.\n\nThe effects of that very Merge event are already being felt, but still have longstanding positives to be uncovered down the line. The decrease in supply will have a massive impact on the token\u2019s scarcity. Therefore, it will only grow in value overtime, and potentially ascend to previuoly unkown heights."

        "content": "Ethereum is poised to reassert itself and outperform other cryptocurrencies in 2024 according to analysts at JPMorgan.\n\nThe key driver will be Ethereum\u2019s highly anticipated EIP-4844 upgrade, dubbed Protodanksharding, slated for rollout in the first half of next year.\n\nKeypoints\n\nEthereum\u2019s upcoming EIP-4844 (Protodanksharding) upgrade in 2024 will likely boost Ethereum\u2019s network activity and help it outperform other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nFactors seen as bullish for Bitcoin in 2024 like spot ETF approvals and the halving event are already priced into Bitcoin\u2019s current value according to JPMorgan.\n\nDecentralized finance continues to struggle to make inroads into traditional finance due to issues like regulation, technical challenges, and lack of cooperation.\n\nVenture capital funding improved slightly in crypto in Q4 2022 but the recovery seems tentative; steady gains in Q1 2024 could signal the end of the crypto winter.\n\nDespite CEO Jamie Dimon\u2019s Bitcoin criticism, JPMorgan\u2019s blockchain unit Onyx continues to grow rapidly underscoring the bank\u2019s ongoing blockchain focus.\n\nThis upgrade will act as a stepping stone toward full Danksharding on Ethereum, a more efficient form of sharding. While originally Ethereum looked to shard by splitting the network into fragments, Danksharding uses temporary data blobs attached to blocks capable of holding more data without altering Ethereum\u2019s block size or permanently storing data on-chain.\n\nCrucially, these data blobs can enhance the efficiency of Layer 2 networks built on Ethereum like Arbitrum and Optimism. By providing additional temporary data capacity, Protodanksharding will enable Layer 2s to increase throughput and lower transaction fees without changing Ethereum itself. This boost to Layer 2 network activity is what will help drive Ethereum\u2019s outperformance, per JPMorgan.\n\nBy contrast, Bitcoin in 2024 faces headwinds that could limit major gains. JPMorgan cautions that presumed 2024 tailwinds like ETF approvals and the upcoming halving are likely already accounted for in Bitcoin\u2019s current price. After previous halvings slowed Bitcoin\u2019s market price growth relative to production costs, a comparable deceleration after the 2024 halving would make sense. With Bitcoin\u2019s price already trading around twice production costs, much halving-related upside seems eliminated.\n\nBeyond technical upgrades, crypto as an asset class still confronts adoption challenges. Decentralized finance\u2019s inability to make traction in mainstream banking and finance persists as a disappointment for JPMorgan.\n\nMajor traditional financial applications of blockchain technology continue to operate on private chains, not public ones. Meanwhile tokenization remains experimental thanks to lacking regulations, uncoordinated technologies, and hesitation around central bank digital currencies."

        "title": "Ethereum's bearish wave 'is already happening,' says expert - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Since October, the crypto market has been enjoying a mostly decisive uptrend, with multiple cryptocurrencies reaching highs not seen since early 2022. Ethereum (ETH), one of the world\u2019s most prominent digital assets, rose above $2,300 during this time.\n\nThings, however, took an unexpected turn in the night between December 10 and 11 when liquidations totaling approximately $300 million sent multiple cryptocurrencies rapidly dropping. Bitcoin (BTC) fell from more than $44,000 to below $42,000, and Ethereum declined from about $2,350 to about $2,250.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which somewhat stabilized, ETH continued its decline, and crypto trader and analyst AlanSantana posted his assessment and the accompanying chart on TradingView, stating that for Ethereum, \u201cthe bearish wave is only now starting, but it is already happening.\u201d\n\nETH price chart analysis. Source: TradingView and AlanSantana\n\nETH is in a strong downtrend as sell volume surges\n\nIn his breakdown of the current state of Ethereum, AlanSantana stated that during trading on December 12, the cryptocurrency \u201cproduced the strongest bearish session in many months.\u201d The analyst went on to explain that ETH\u2019s selling volume has significantly overtaken the buying volume and that the cryptocurrency, in fact, closed below the 10-day exponential moving average (EMA 10).\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s relative strength index (RSI), amidst the bearish momentum, is \u201cjumping off a cliff.\u201d\n\nWhile warning that ETH is bound for a significant drop, AlanSantana also offered some silver lining to crypto traders, predicting that after the current price correction is over, the cryptocurrency will have a stronger year than 2021. In 2021, Ethereum rose above $4,000 for the first and only time in its history and ended the year strong at more than $3,760.\n\nFinally, in his post, AlanSantana concluded that despite the bearish trend, there is little reason to panic and added that the market always offers opportunities to investors and always offers enough time to act.\n\nThere is always plenty of time to act. The market offers endless opportunities\u2026 And is here to stay.\n\nETH price analysis\n\nEthereum entered the biggest bull run of 2023 in late October after renewed investor enthusiasm and a string of positive news sent the crypto market rallying. This uptrend experienced a sharp stop in the early hours of Monday, December 11, and in the last seven days ETH declined 7.94%.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s performance in the last 24 hours seemingly confirms AlanSantana\u2019s assessment, as Ethereum declined 2.17% and stood at $ 2,184 at the time of publication.\n\nETH 1-day price chart.\n\nDespite the current price correction, ETH\u2019s overall performance so far in 2023 remains impressive. Between October 18 and December 13, it climbed about $500 from $1,567. Since the beginning of the year, Ethereum is up a total of 80.96%.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative.

        "content": "JPMorgan analysts predict that Ethereum will see massive growth in 2024, mostly thanks to its upcoming EIP-4844 upgrade. This upgrade will introduce improved sharding methods.\n\nCurrently, the crypto community is watching the Bitcoin price movement amidst hopes that it will enter a full-on bull run and reach a new price high in 2024. But according to a new report from JPMorgan, it might actually be Ethereum that will see runaway success in 2024.\n\n2024 a Big Year for Ethereum?\n\nAs per the report, Ethereum will \u201cre-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem,\u201d in 2024. The main reason why JPMorgan shares this optimism is because of the incoming EIP-4844 upgrade scheduled to take place in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe EIP-4844 upgrade will see the ecosystem take on a more efficient sharding technique. Sharding involves splitting a blockchain into smaller chains so that more transactions can be processed. The EIP-4844 upgrade means that Ethereum will not split itself into smaller shards but will instead create data packets that can handle these extra transactions.\n\nThere will also be immense benefits for Ethereum Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum which will enjoy lower transaction fees and increased network capabilities.\n\nUpgrades within the Ethereum ecosystem have always been a big deal. The recent switch to a proof-of-stake consensus earned Ethereum a lot of favor with the public and the same will likely be true of the EIP-4844 upgrade. JP Morgan believes that this will lead to not just goodwill but a stronger and more successful blockchain as well.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that Bitcoin is being completely left behind either. JPMorgan believes that several factors, including the incoming halving and the potential approval of an ETF, will help the Bitcoin price improve. A halving typically comes with positive price movements for Bitcoin and it looks like this incoming one will be no different.\n\nThe ETF is especially interesting because it has been so heavily pursued within the industry. Many companies have applied for it over the years but BlackRock seems to be on the brink of being approved. Should the ETF go through, we can expect the price, as well as public interest in Bitcoin, to increase.\n\nIt has also been speculated that there will be some benefits for Ethereum as well. BlackRock is believed to be pursuing an Ethereum ETF if the Bitcoin ETF goes through and the token should enjoy the same benefits.\n\nThe report also noted some of the \u2018disappointments\u2019 of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, mainly its failure to embed itself in the traditional finance world. Several factors were noted as the cause of this, including a lack of regulations and the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies.\n\nWith all these considered, 2024 is shaping up to be a profitable year for the major tokens and hopefully, this will trickle down to the rest of the industry."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitwise, the world's largest crypto index fund manager, noted in its prediction for 2024 that Ethereum is poised to witness a doubling in its revenue.\n\nFurthermore, the EIP-4844 upgrade is expected to reduce the average transaction cost on Ethereum by 90%.\n\nEthereum price is maintaining a bullish macro outlook, marking a 53% rise in the past two months.\n\nWhile 2024 is expected to be Bitcoin's year in more ways than one, it will also bear a significant impact on Ethereum price and network. But in its own way, the home of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is predicted to make an impact on the market by likely improving the overall operations and financials of the network.\n\nEthereum revenue to double in 2024\n\nBitwise Asset Management, the world's largest crypto index fund manager, published its predictions for 2024. Two of these ten predictions are focused on Ethereum, making it the most in-demand network despite the rise of layer-2 chains and competitive layer-1 chains.\n\nBitwise noted that Ethereum revenue will probably double to $5 billion over the next year. Per the report, the network reported $2.3 billion in fees, i.e., revenue, which is almost half the revenue of 2022's $4.1 billion. Bitwise, in regard to this prediction noted,\n\n\"Ethereum functions like a global supercomputer, hosting thousands of crypto applications that people use every day. And in order to use those applications, you have to pay a fee using the Ethereum crypto asset. That's cash flow.\"\n\nEthereum network revenue\n\nAnother crucial prediction for 2024, the asset manager made, was that the average transaction costs on Ethereum will fall to $0.01. This prediction falls in line with the expected network upgrade going by the name of EIP-4844.\n\nThe primary goal of the proposal is to reduce the average transaction cost by 90% in order to make the network more accessible to mainstream users. According to Bitwise's report, with fees going down, Ethereum will radically increase the types of activities individuals can feasibly participate in on the network. Major product ideas like micropayments, social media, and large-scale gaming would become possible.\n\nWhether these pan out in 2024 is up to the conditions of the market at that time and the impact they would have on Ethereum price.\n\nEthereum price remains bullish\n\nEthereum price in the short-term timeframe might have noted some correction, but when it comes to the macro outlook, ETH is still bullish. The 53% increase observed in the past two months is expected to continue into 2024, potentially bringing the price to $2,500.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is exhibiting bullish signal on the 3-day chart. This bullishness might exhaust or demand some correction following the spot Bitcoin ETF approval rally.\n\nHowever, at the moment, ETH is expected to recover and flip the $2,296 resistance into support to push the price to $2,421.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nIf this breach fails, the altcoin could retrace to $2,142 and losing this support line would invalidate the bullish thesis, likely pushing ETH down to $2,000."

        "content": "JPMorgan analysts, while maintaining an overall cautious stance on the cryptocurrency market, foresee Ethereum (ETH) surpassing Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies in market price performance by 2024.\n\nThis bullish outlook for Ethereum reflects a distinctive perspective within the institution, suggesting that the analysts see unique potential and favorable prospects for Ethereum relative to other digital assets, even amid an overall cautious sentiment towards the broader crypto landscape.\n\nIn a published note on Wednesday, a team of analysts headed by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou conveyed their expectation that Ethereum (ETH) will reclaim its prominence and regain market share within the cryptocurrency ecosystem in the upcoming year.\n\nEthereum Will Overtake Bitcoin \u2013 JPMorgan\n\n\u201cWe believe that next year Ethereum will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem,\u201d Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note.\n\nThe analysts underscored the pivotal role of the EIP-4844 upgrade, popularly known as Protodanksharding, as the primary catalyst for Ethereum\u2019s anticipated resurgence.\n\nThis crucial upgrade, scheduled for implementation in the first half of 2024, is poised to bring about substantial improvements in Ethereum\u2019s network activity.\n\nDanksharding is a more efficient sharding method for Ethereum, and protodanksharding is the first step toward its complete implementation. Danksharding sidesteps the tedious procedure of dividing Ethereum into several shard chains, as contrast to the initially intended sharding method.\n\nETH market cap currently at $273 billion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nData blobs, which are connected to blocks and can hold more data than blocks but are not permanently stored or accessible by the Ethereum virtual engine, are instead introduced.\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan\u2019s optimistic forecast aligns with Standard Chartered\u2019s, as they previously stated in a communication that Ether might experience a 400% surge within a few years, followed by a more sustained upward movement towards $35,000.\n\nGeoff Kendrick, the Head of FX Research, West, and Digital Assets Research, expressed the viewpoint that the upward trajectory for Ether might unfold at a more gradual pace compared to Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: 5x Increase\n\nDespite this potentially more extended timeframe, Kendrick envisions Ethereum eventually attaining a higher price multiple than Bitcoin relative to their current levels. Specifically, he anticipates Ethereum reaching a price multiple of 5.0x, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s expected 3.5x multiple.\n\nLayer 2 networks, such as Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB), would gain the most from the upgrade, according to the JPMorgan analysts.\n\nEther seen rising to $2,426 this month. Source: Coincodex\n\nLayer 2 networks on Ethereum would benefit from the increased temporary data space, which would increase network throughput and decrease transaction fees. Data blobs improve Layer 2 network efficiency without changing the size of an Ethereum block.\n\nIn the meantime, as ether discovers new applications, demand for it will rise, and cryptocurrency-related trends will only grow. For example, the most common Ethereum use case is NFT transactions, which Kendrick believes will grow.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ether was trading at $2,281, up 5.0% in the last 24 hours, while Bitcoin was exhanging hands at $42,910, with a 2.3% increase in the same timeframe.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Discover SCENE\n\nJP Morgan has poured cold water on hopes of a crypto bull run next year, with the bank\u2019s analysts taking a \u201ccautious\u201d stance in their 2024 crypto outlook.\n\nAnalysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a newly published report that the Bitcoin halving is \u201clargely priced in,\u201d since the halving event and its effect on the Bitcoin supply are \u201cpredictable and in our opinion are well factored into the current bitcoin price.\u201d\n\nThe team argued that based on the current Bitcoin hash rate and mining difficulty, that the production cost for miners would rise from around $22,000 at present to around $44,000 post-halving.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current price of around $42,000 is consistent with a 5% drop in the post-halving hash rate, which \u201cseems too low,\u201d with the team anticipating a 20% drop in the hash rate and miners with higher overheads exiting the market.\n\nSince the 2020 halving brought Bitcoin's price to a 1:1 ratio with miners\u2019 production cost, and the current Bitcoin price is around twice the production cost, it implies that the 2024 halving is largely priced in, the report suggested.\n\nEthereum could \u201coutperform\u201d Bitcoin in 2024, the report said, pointing to the EIP-4844 \u201cProtodanksharding\u201d upgrade as a potential catalyst, but raised concerns about centralization of staking on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe report cautioned that it is \u201ctoo early to be getting excited\u201d about a revival of DeFi and NFT activity, while pointing to the \u201cencouraging\u201d rise of new DeFi chains including Aptos, SUI and Pulsechain, and the \u201crenewed interest\u201d in NFTs prompted by the emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF flop?\n\nJP Morgan analysts also expressed skepticism that the long-anticipated approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF would bring fresh capital to the market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe report cited both the lack of interest from investors in already-approved spot ETFs in Canada and Europe, and the likelihood that capital would move into spot Bitcoin ETFs from existing Bitcoin products, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Bitcoin futures ETFs and Bitcoin mining companies.\n\nThe report argued that as much as $2.7 billion could exit GBTC following its conversion to a spot Bitcoin ETF, as investors take profit. Were those funds to exit the market rather than moving into other Bitcoin instruments, it would put \u201csevere downward pressure\u201d on the price of Bitcoin, analysts said.\n\nJP Morgan and crypto\n\nThe JP Morgan report comes just a week after the firms\u2019 CEO, Jamie Dimon, took aim at crypto in a Senate Banking Committee hearing, saying that he would \u201cclose it down\u201d if he were the U.S. government.\n\nDimon claimed that, \u201cThe true use case for it [crypto] is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance,\u201d adding that, \u201cI\u2019ve always been opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etcetera.\u201d"

        "content": "Cardano is constantly beating the \u201cghost chain\u201d claims, recently outperforming all other networks, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, to top the list of blockchains in chain activity.\n\nData from crypto-focused research and analytical resource Messari confirms this feat. According to Messari, Cardano currently leads in terms of chain activity over the past 24 hours. Notably, the metric employed by the platform to gauge a network\u2019s chain activity is its on-chain transaction volume.\n\nThis metric shows that Cardano beats every other mainstream blockchain network by an impressive margin. Interestingly, Cardano\u2019s 24-hour on-chain transaction volume currently stands at $23.56 billion. Notably, this represents all the transaction volume recorded yesterday.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBefore now, Cardano\u2019s on-chain transaction volume averaged $9 billion every day throughout November. However, the network started witnessing an uptick in December, surging to a high of $11.32 billion on Dec. 2. This uptick persisted, with Cardano recording $29.86 billion on Dec. 9.\n\nDespite witnessing a drop in the days that followed, Cardano has maintained an intraday on-chain volume above the $18 billion mark. The recent $23.56 billion was recorded due to a new upsurge in this metric.\n\nMeanwhile, per Messari data, Bitcoin, the leading blockchain network, comes second on the list, with $13.09 billion in on-chain transaction volume, nearly half of Cardano\u2019s figure. Ethereum, the largest smart contracts network, secures third with just $5.06 billion in transaction volume.\n\nLitecoin sees a volume of $1.51 billion, while the XRP Ledger\u2019s volume only stands at $777 million. Other blockchain networks on the top ten list include Dogecoin, Tron, Bitcoin Cash, Verge, and Stellar.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nIt bears mentioning that on-chain volume is different from trading volume. Trading volume refers to the total number of shares, contracts, or assets traded on a specific market, especially on exchanges, during a given period. It is typically a measure of market activity and liquidity.\n\nOn the other hand, on-chain transaction volume involves the total number of transactions that occur on a blockchain. It includes all transactions, whether they involve trading, transfers, or other interactions within the network. On-chain transaction volume provides insights into the level of activity and usage of a blockchain.\n\nA high on-chain transaction volume indicates active use of a blockchain for various purposes, such as transfers, smart contract executions, and dApp interactions. This metric helps to evaluate the health and sustainability of a blockchain network, showcasing its utility beyond speculative trading.\n\nAmid the increased on-chain transaction volume, ADA, Cardano\u2019s native token, has witnessed an impressive price surge. ADA recently surged to a 19-month high of $0.68 today before facing opposition. Currently changing hands at $0.6349, the altcoin is up 42% over the past week."

        "content": "The SSV Network has successfully launched its permissionless mainnet, marking a notable advancement in Ethereum\u2019s staking landscape. This launch is distinguished as the first of its kind to employ Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), an innovation aimed at enhancing the security and resilience of Ethereum staking.\n\nTransforming Ethereum\u2019s Staking Paradigm\n\nDVT, the cornerstone of SSV Network\u2019s recent deployment, introduces a method where Ethereum validators can distribute their responsibilities across multiple parties. Consequently, this reduces the risk of a single point of failure and bolsters the network\u2019s overall robustness.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlon Muroch, a core founder of SSV Network, emphasized that this technology not only escalates security but also addresses critical challenges like decentralization and resistance to censorship.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Decentralization Drive and SSV\u2019s Role\n\nThe current Ethereum staking model has been under scrutiny due to centralization concerns, with dominant entities like Lido and Coinbase commanding a substantial portion of the staking market. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has consistently highlighted the necessity of decentralized validators. SSV Network\u2019s initiative aligns perfectly with this vision, providing an alternative that could dilute the concentration of power in Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, to encourage adoption, the SSV DAO has put forth a year-long incentivization program, committing 1 million SSV tokens, valued at approximately $24 million, to reward participants. This strategy not only incentivizes users to register validators on the SSV Network but also offers node operators from other protocols an opportunity to augment their rewards.\n\nThe journey to SSV Network\u2019s permissionless mainnet spans three years of dedicated development. Since its partner mainnet launch in September, the network has seen nearly $160 million in ether staked through its platform. This milestone underscores the network\u2019s commitment to enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nRead Also: Montenegro Prolongs Detention of Terraform Labs Co-Founder Do Kwon"

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin introduced a new concept for the blockchain platform called an \u201censhrined Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (ZK-EVM) in a Dec. 13 blog post.\n\nThe proposal\u2019s main goal is to substantially improve the efficiency and security of Ethereum\u2019s Layer-2 protocols, including optimistic and ZK rollups.\n\nAddressing challenges in Layer-2 protocols\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal arises from a need to streamline the current Layer-2 solutions on Ethereum. These protocols, vital for Ethereum\u2019s scalability, depend heavily on EVM verification, which currently involves relying on a large, potentially vulnerable codebase.\n\nAdditionally, ZK-EVMs, designed to mimic the Layer-1 EVM, face the challenge of keeping up with changes in the main Ethereum protocol, leading to redundant efforts and increased risk of security flaws.\n\nThe solution proposed by Buterin involves embedding a ZK-EVM directly within the Ethereum network. This internal ZK-EVM would undertake the task of verifying Layer-1 Ethereum blocks, thereby offering a more efficient and secure approach.\n\nAs Ethereum advances, particularly with the development of light clients using ZK-SNARKs, the concept of a native ZK-EVM becomes increasingly practical and appealing.\n\nCore aspects of the proposed ZK-EVM\n\nButerin envisions the ZK-EVM to focus mainly on verifying Ethereum blocks by processing inputs like a pre-state root, a block, and a post-state root.\n\nThis would ensure the integrity of the post-state root as a true outcome of block execution. The proposal also aligns with Ethereum\u2019s multi-client philosophy, supporting the use of diverse proving systems and emphasizing the importance of data availability and auditability.\n\nImplementing a ZK-EVM, as described by Buterin, presents several design challenges and trade-offs. Essential properties include:\n\nCompatibility and Adaptability: The system should be flexible enough to support various proving systems, reflecting Ethereum\u2019s commitment to a multi-client environment. Ensuring Data Availability: Vital for enabling verification by different clients. Emphasizing Auditability and Upgradeability: Allowing for easy inspection and quick resolutions to any issues without requiring hard forks. Supporting Innovations in \u2018Almost-EVMs\u2019: Permitting Layer-2 solutions to extend and innovate upon standard EVM functionalities.\n\nA crucial part of Buterin\u2019s discussion revolves around choosing between an open multi-client system, where proofs are verified externally, and a closed system with predetermined proof systems. Buterin advocates for an available system for its flexibility and compatibility with Ethereum\u2019s foundational principles despite its higher complexity.\n\nButerin emphasizes that speed is critical for ZK-EVM implementations. With technological advancements in parallelization and hardware acceleration, the goal is to reduce proof generation time, allowing for near-instantaneous processing."

Such a move could make it more affordable for players to try new games, and potentially remove significant barriers to broader blockchain gaming adoption.\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of norms in the blockchain space that mainstream players simply won\u2019t accept\u2014gas fees fall into that category,\u201d said Immutable Product Marketing Lead Michael Powell in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo truly appeal to all gamers, Web3 games must be able to offer players a familiar and streamlined user experience, making the blockchain components as effortless and native as possible,\u201d Powell added.\n\nPlayers who use the upcoming universal gamer profile system Immutable Passport will be able to avoid gas fees for games sponsored by their developers. Immutable says that it will sponsor gas fees for all games itself for a \"limited time\" when the zkEVM mainnet launches early next year.\n\nTo make their games gas-free, game studios can deposit funds into a special smart contract wallet, so fees from Passport users are automatically paid without showing up for players. Immutable believes the cost to studios will be negligible compared to the benefits.\n\nUltimately, Immutable zkEVM and Passport aim to abstract gas fees from players and push for a monetization model where studios treat gas costs like infrastructure expenses. The company believes that this will lead to smoother onboarding and higher transaction conversion rates.\n\nMore than 200 games have currently committed to building within Immutable's broader ecosystem, with titles like Shardbound, MetalCore, and Space Nation set to launch on the Immutable zkEVM network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nJPMorgan announced in a research note on Wednesday that the investment bank expects Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nThat prediction comes as a surprise to many in the crypto community after Bitcoin has led the recent rally. Bitcoin is up 156% this year, while Ethereum is up only 90%. The ETH-BTC ratio, a measure of the growth of Ethereum relative to Bitcoin, has fallen to 0.053 from 0.072 at the start of the year.\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s lag this year, JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou stated that \u201cwe believe that next year Ethereum will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem.\u201d\n\nProto-Danksharding Promises to Boost Ethereum\u2019s Speed\n\nThe catalyst behind JPMorgan\u2019s optimistic outlook is Ethereum\u2019s recent EIP-4844 upgrade, which introduces proto-Danksharding onto the world\u2019s largest smart contract network.\n\nDanksharding is a form of data sharding that uses temporary data blobs that temporarily attach to blocks in the Ethereum blockchain. This extra data is expected to boost network throughput, particularly for Layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum that operate on top of Ethereum.\n\nThe proto-danksharding upgrade initiates a test of how danksharding can improve transaction speeds and lower gas fees on Ethereum. If successful, the upgrade could pave the way for wider implementation and make Ethereum more competitive with ultra-fast chains like Solana and Cardano.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Driving Further Speculation around ETH\n\nWhile not explicitly mentioned in JPMorgan\u2019s report, there\u2019s another potential catalyst for Ethereum in 2024: a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nBlackRock submitted an application to the SEC for a spot ETH ETF in mid-November. While there\u2019s been little movement on the application so far, analysts widely expect that the SEC will approve an Ethereum ETF shortly after it approves a wave of spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nIf approval comes, it\u2019s likely to happen in 2024\u2014and Ethereum could see a significant run-up in price as investors speculate on the SEC\u2019s decision and the future mainstreaming of ETH.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Stands to Surge from Ethereum\u2019s Gains\n\nEthereum\u2019s rise in 2024 could bring many altcoins built on the Ethereum blockchain along with it. Chief among tokens that stand to benefit is Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX), a stake-to-mine token that enables investors to earn Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is designed to revolutionize the way that investors mine Bitcoin. $BTCMTX token holders can stake their coins and earn mining credits, which they can redeem for hashpower in the cloud. Mined Bitcoin is sent back to the Bitcoin Minetrix pool and distributed to investors as a reward.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix benefits from Ethereum\u2019s performance in two key ways.\n\nFirst, any growth in the Ethereum ecosystem tends to benefit altcoins that use its network. Investors become more willing to buy altcoins, and especially those like Bitcoin Minetrix that deliver above-average staking rewards.\n\nSecond, Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin in 2024 could draw attention and miners away from Bitcoin, making it easier and cheaper to mine BTC. Bitcoin Minetrix token holders will get more hashpower for their staked $BTCMTX, enabling them to mine more Bitcoin with the same amount of investment.\n\nEven if Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin next year, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency is likely to keep rising\u2014so any gains in mining returns would be a boon for $BTCMTX token holders and send the value of this token soaring.\n\nThe good news for investors is that there\u2019s a chance to buy Bitcoin Minetrix now before this flywheel starts turning. $BTCMTX is available on presale at a price of $0.0122, but investors have to hurry. The presale has already raised more than $5.25 million and the price is set to increase in just over 48 hours.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale"

        "title": "Cardano (ADA): What It Is, How It Differs From Bitcoin - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Cardano (ADA)?\n\nCardano (ADA) is a decentralized proof of stake (PoS) blockchain designed to be a more efficient alternative to proof of work (PoW) networks. It is intended to evolve into a system with multiple use cases, governed by those who have staked their cryptocurrency.\n\nCardano\u2019s cryptocurrency is named Ada after Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815\u20131852), commonly regarded as the first computer programmer. Ada is used in the blockchain\u2019s PoS consensus mechanism. It is given as a reward for work done for the blockchain or can be purchased on exchanges.\n\nKey Takeaways Cardano is a blockchain platform that was founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson. It was launched in 2017.\n\nCardano aims to be a decentralized application (dApp) development platform with a multi-asset ledger and verifiable smart contracts.\n\nCardano runs on the proof-of-stake Ouroboros consensus protocol using its native token, Ada.\n\nHistory of Cardano (ADA)\n\nCharles Hoskinson, an Ethereum co-founder, began developing Cardano in 2015 and launched the platform in 2017. Cardano has positioned itself as an alternative to Ethereum. Both platforms are used for similar applications, such as smart contracts, and aim to build a connected and decentralized system.\n\nCardano considers itself an updated version of Ethereum and has anointed itself a \u201cthird-generation\u201d platform compared with Ethereum\u2019s \u201csecond-generation\u201d credentials. The blockchain platform also has a goal of providing banking services to the world\u2019s unbanked.\n\nCardano vs. Bitcoin\n\nThere are several key differences between Bitcoin and Cardano. Bitcoin was developed to be a peer-to-peer payment system. Cardano is an ecosystem that allows other developers to create tokens, decentralized applications (dApps), or any other uses a scalable blockchain network can host.\n\nThe Cardano platform runs on the Ouroboros consensus protocol. Ouroboros, created by Cardano in its foundation phase, was the first proof of stake (PoS) protocol designed to reduce the energy expenditure required by proof of work (PoW) mining. It does this by eliminating the massive computing resources that the proof of work algorithm uses.\n\nCardano doesn\u2019t reward its cryptocurrency as an incentive in a competitive mining process like Bitcoin. This reduces the energy and waste footprints by not requiring large amounts of electricity to power computers specifically designed for mining. Cardano users can install compatible wallet software on their computers or devices, stake their Ada, and begin earning rewards for participating.\n\n\n\nAda is Cardano\u2019s digital currency, named after Augusta Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century countess and English mathematician recognized as the first computer programmer.\n\nWhat Is Cardano Staking?\n\nIn Cardano\u2019s PoS system, staking determines a node\u2019s capability to open blocks on the blockchain. A node\u2019s stake is equal to the amount of Ada it holds over the long term. A stake is an interest a pool participant holds, secured with Ada that is pledged. Pledged Ada cannot be used or spent by the holder because it is held as collateral for honest validation behavior. Users with pledged Ada are given rewards based on the amount of Ada they have staked.\n\nUsers join or create staking pools\u2014groups of Ada holders who have pledged their coins\u2014and work together to update the ledger, open new blocks, and earn rewards.\n\nHow Do Cardano Staking Pools Work?\n\nCardano uses the PoS consensus mechanism, in which users \u201cstake\u201d a coin for the opportunity to become a validator. Users can participate in the staking and validation process in two ways: You can stake your Ada in a pool or create your own. Stake pools are trusted server nodes that conduct the work of validating transactions. These pools can be either public or private. Public pools distribute rewards to members based on how much Ada they have staked. Private pools, as the name suggests, give rewards to the owner(s).\n\nA stake pool must be run by an operator with the knowledge and skills to maintain the stake pool by renting servers, monitoring the node, holding the pool key, and conducting other pool administration tasks.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nCardano implemented smart contract support in 2021 with its Alonzo update. This testnet update was the first iteration of bringing the promised scalability and use cases to users. This update allowed users to create smart contracts and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and manage multiple assets. Future releases and forks will bring more capabilities to the mainnet.\n\nWhat Is the Best Place to Stake Cardano?\n\nThere are several staking pools you can choose from to stake your Ada. It\u2019s essential to thoroughly read through a pool\u2019s website, user reviews, complaints, or issues to be sure that you\u2019re joining a reputable pool.\n\nYou can also use the community-built tools ADApools.org, Cardanoscan.io, Pool.pm, Poolstats.org, or Pooltool.io to help you select a pool. You can also use the Yoroi, Exodus, or Binance wallets to stake your Ada. You can also use Daedalus, a full desktop application developed by IOHK that downloads a copy of the blockchain. Daedalus is a full node that acts as a wallet that verifies all transactions in its history and lets you choose a pool to join.\n\n\n\nFuture of Cardano\n\nCardano is designed to be developed in \u201ceras\u201d named after notable figures in poetry and computer science history: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. Basho is the era of scaling and optimization, intended to bring more capabilities to Cardano. As of 2023, Cardano is anticipating the transition from Basho to Voltaire.\n\nVoltaire is the final era for Cardano development, intended to bring voting and treasury management of the blockchain and network through previously introduced smart contract functionality and system improvements. When Voltaire is complete, IOHK\u2019s goal is to release the blockchain and network to the community, as it will be fully decentralized and able to be developed, maintained, and kept secure.\n\n\n\nWhere Do I Get Cardano (ADA)? You can buy Cardano (ADA) on cryptocurrency exchanges or by participating in the network.\n\nHow Do I Mine Cardano (ADA)? Cardano cannot be mined in the way that other cryptocurrencies can. Instead, it must be purchased on a cryptocurrency exchange or earned.\n\nWhat Is the Cardano (ADA) Market Cap? Cardano (ADA) had a market capitalization of about $22.2 billion on Dec. 13, 2023.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCardano is a decentralized PoS blockchain founded in 2015 and launched in 2017. It has positioned itself as an alternative to PoW blockchains like Bitcoin because it is more energy-efficient and scalable.\n\nThe plans behind Cardano\u2019s development are ambitious. Its developers see Cardano as eventually becoming fully decentralized when voting and treasury management of blockchain are added to its capabilities in the future.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could rise 6% to test the $45,000 level amid rising volatility steered by broader market macroeconomics.\n\nEthereum price coils up for a 7% move to the range high of $2,403 as the bulls scale a comeback.\n\nRipple price could climb 10% to the supply zone as the $0.5773 support floor presents a springboard for XRP.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price recorded increased volatility during the afternoon hours of the New York session. This spilled over to altcoins, with Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices showing strength alongside the king of cryptocurrency. It came after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes with Fed chair Jerome Powell hinting at more rate cuts than he did previously. Specifically, the markets moved as the 1-year interest rate outlook fell from 5.1% to 4.6%.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price shoots to $42,800 as FOMC keeps interest rates unchanged\n\nBitcoin price eyes a 6% climb to $45,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has witnessed increased volatility, as the Fed kept interest rates unchanged.

In a highly bullish case, BTC could extend to the $48,000 psychological level. Such a move would constitute a 12% climb above the current level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, if profit booking ensues, Bitcoin price could pull south, potentially losing the $40,000 support level. In the dire case, the slum could extend for Bitcoin to test the $37,800 critical support, below which BTC could spiral all the way to the $32,000 level or worse, the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price looks insecure, thinly holds above $40,000 heading into FOMC\n\nEthereum price finds strength for a possible 7% climb\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is attempting to recover all the ground lost since the December 11 fall, getting tailwinds from the FOMC-inspired optimism. Increased buyer momentum could see Ether reclaim the support due to the midline of the ascending channel at $2,288, or higher, extending to tag the $2,403 range high.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, after a 5% climb, investors who bought ETH at the $2,147 low could be tempted to book profits. The ensuing selling momentum could see Ethereum price lose the aforementioned base, potentially descending into the supply zone turned bullish breaker. A daily candlestick close below the midline of this order block under $2,075 would confirm the continuation of the slump.\n\nThis could set the tone for Ethereum price to spiral towards the $2,000 psychological level or worse, extend a leg lower to the $1,935 support.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum leads altcoins north as Bitcoin halts amid bull trap fears\n\nRipple price finds strength for a 10% climb\n\nRipple (XRP) price has found an inflection point, pivoting around the $0.5773 support amid rising momentum. If buying pressure increases, XRP price could foray into the supply zone ranging from $0.6572 to $0.7161. To confirm the continuation of the uptrend, the price must break and close above the midline of the zone at $0.6872. This would represent a 10% climb above current levels.\n\nThis could set the tone for an extended climb, potentially going as high as the $0.8000 psychological level, or in highly ambitious cases, stretch to test $0.8505.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if sellers have their say, Ripple price could descend below the critical support at $0.5773, with a break and close below this level invalidating the bullish scenario.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price risks 7% fall as Ripple lawyer names \u2018the single biggest threat to crypto in the US\u2019"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nEthereum saw a pullback from just above the long-term resistance at $2300.\n\nThe dip in active addresses pointed to a reduction in demand for ETH in the market.\n\nEthereum [ETH] noted a decent retracement of its gains earlier in December. While the trend and the market structure remained bullish on the one-day chart, some on-chain metrics outlined that selling pressure was on the rise.\n\nThe deflationary nature of Ethereum should inspire confidence in long-term holders. Estimates of shrinking ETH supply do not help in the short-term market sentiment, and a move to $2000 or lower was still a possibility.\n\nWill the $2130 support hold?\n\nIn early November, ETH shot skyward to reach $2130 and began to pull back thereafter. This retracement took nearly three weeks before Ethereum bulls were back in control.\n\nThey needed to capture the $2000 level as support and managed to do so and beat the local highs at $2130 afterward.\n\nOn the way higher, ETH took some time to consolidate at the $2030 region before the swift push northward. This region was highlighted in cyan. Combined with its proximity to the $2000 mark, it should serve as a strong support zone.\n\nThe $2019 level was the recent higher low, and a move beneath it would flip the one-day market structure bearishly. At press time, the RSI floated just above neutral 50 to denote bullish momentum.\n\nThe OBV was also in an uptrend, though it saw a dip in recent days.\n\nThese metrics signal caution\n\nThe age-consumed metric saw some notable spikes over the past two weeks. The most recent one arrived on the 10th of December when ETH was trading at $2340.\n\nA couple of days later, the mean coin age, which had previously been in a strong uptrend, cratered. This suggested a lot of ETH had been moved between addresses. Combined with the age consumed, it suggested a spike in selling pressure.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThis increased selling saw Ethereum prices fall toward the $2100 mark. Notably, the active addresses count began to falter over the past week. The MVRV ratio also reached a new high.\n\nHolders whose ETH was in profit chose to sell their assets to realize some of these profits. Overall, the metrics suggested that long-term investors had reasons for concern."

        "content": "In a recently released financial outlook for 2024, JP Morgan, a global leader in financial services, has presented a cautious stance on the cryptocurrency industry. Despite the approaching Bitcoin halving event, the bank anticipates Ethereum (ETH) outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming year. This forecast emerges amidst heightened anticipation and speculation within the crypto market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s EIP-4844 Could Eclipse Bitcoin\u2019s Growth\n\nJP Morgan\u2019s analysis suggests Ethereum could see more significant growth than Bitcoin in 2024. The bank points to Ethereum\u2019s upcoming EIP-4844 update, also known as \u201cProto-dank sharding,\u201d as a potential catalyst for its performance. This upgrade is expected to enhance Ethereum\u2019s network efficiency and scalability, giving it an edge in the market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nContrastingly, Bitcoin\u2019s much-anticipated halving event, which traditionally has been a bullish signal for the cryptocurrency, is considered by JP Morgan to be already factored into its current price. The halving, which reduces the reward for mining new Bitcoins, is expected to increase production costs and potentially lead to a 20% decline in the hash rate. According to JP Morgan, this could result in higher operating costs for miners and drive less efficient miners out of the market.\n\nEthereum Favored Over Bitcoin in JP Morgan\u2019s Outlook\n\nOne of the central themes in JP Morgan\u2019s report is the notion of \u201cexcessive optimism\u201d surrounding Bitcoin. As per the bank\u2019s analysts, this optimism has led to the asset being overbought in a market that has preemptively priced in the effects of the upcoming halving event. The bank further argues that the expectations for capital inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETF products are overstated, potentially setting up the market for disappointment.\n\nRegarding mining, the halving event is expected to double production costs based on current hash rates and Bitcoin mining difficulties. This cost increase, combined with a predicted decline in the hash rate, may force miners with excessive operating costs to exit, further impacting the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nWhile JP Morgan\u2019s outlook favours Ethereum over Bitcoin in the upcoming year, the bank has not shied away from expressing concerns regarding Ethereum, particularly its centralized staking mechanism. This aspect of Ethereum\u2019s network has raised questions about network security and decentralization, critical factors in any cryptocurrency\u2019s broader acceptance and success.\n\nRead Also: Tether Freezes Attacker\u2019s Wallet in Ledger Library Exploit"

Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum wallet Rainbow announced the launch of its Rainbow Points rewards program on Tuesday, calling it \u201cthe first step towards including our community in the future success of Rainbow\u201d\u2014and potentially teasing a future token airdrop ahead.\n\nAll Ethereum users were airdropped points based on their on-chain activity, Rainbow said, including their wallet balance, with extra rewards for switching from the popular MetaMask wallet to Rainbow, and for holding at least one Rainbow NFT at the time holders on Monday.\n\nRainbow\u2019s points-based incentive model recalls that of leading NFT marketplace Blur, which stole away dominant market share from OpenSea by giving out points that eventually led to the BLUR token airdrop. Blur has since given out hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens to users since earlier this year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s considered a form of \u201cvampire attack.\u201d A vampire attack is when a new project or protocol provides more incentives or rewards to use its comparable service over that of an established market leader\u2014in this case, MetaMask.\n\nWelcome to Rainbow Points \u2014 the first step towards including our community in the future success of Rainbow Every Ethereum user has been dropped points today \ud83c\udf08 Claim your points and start earning more by doing the things you already do onchain pic.twitter.com/UsUOOGxC0b \u2014 Rainbow (@rainbowdotme) December 12, 2023\n\nIn its announcement, Rainbow said users who import their MetaMask wallet into Rainbow could receive up to 150,000 extra points. Rainbow \u201ctrue believers,\u201d or dedicated users of the wallet, will \u201cget the most\u201d points per a tweet thread.

MetaMask said in early 2022 that it plans to launch a token, but nothing has come of it yet.\n\nWhat is an airdrop?\n\nAirdrops refer to free cryptocurrency tokens sent to wallets already holding a cryptocurrency like Ethereum or Solana, or to the wallets of early users or contributors to a new protocol or app.\n\nWho receives an airdrop can vary depending on the stipulations of the groups sending the tokens. Similar to play-to-earn tokens, airdrops from protocols like Blur and Pyth Network reward users who participate in the network.\n\nAirdrops are very popular in the DeFi space; last month, a single user received $8.4 million worth of BLUR in the \u201csecond season\u201d of Blur NFT marketplace airdrops.\n\nLast week, Jito, a DeFi protocol on the Solana network, announced an airdrop of 90 million tokens in anticipation of the JTO token being listed on Coinbase. After the listing on Coinbase, the combined value of the distributed tokens hit $225 million.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "The expectations of a rapid rise in the altcoin market capitalization were supported by technical analysis.\n\nSome selling pressure could depress Ethereum\u2019s prices in Q1 2024.\n\nThe crypto market has been on fire since mid-October. Bitcoin [BTC] saw a giant increase in trading volume as bulls poured in and forced prices to smash the $29.8k resistance to smithereens.\n\nSince then, large-cap assets such as Ethereum [ETH] have also performed well.\n\nA bird\u2019s eye view of the crypto market at large, as well as the altcoin market, could help put where we are right now in perspective. In that endeavor, the market capitalization of the total crypto market and that of the altcoin sector was examined.\n\nThe highs from October and August 2022 were breached\n\nThe market capitalization excluding BTC and ETH is the altcoin market cap. The $413.8B and $453.9B had been highs from October and August 2022 respectively.\n\nAt press time, the market cap has beaten both these levels. The weekly chart showed that the next significant level was at $839.1B. A move here would mean the market cap gained more than 80%.\n\nDuring the previous cycle, the altcoin market cap highs set in 2018 were respected till September 2020. Thereafter, it was flipped to support, and the market continued to soar till late 2022.\n\nIt is thus possible that the same scenario could play itself out once again, and that the $839B resistance might not pose much of an obstacle once the bull run is in motion.\n\nAssessing the timeline\n\nThe cycle in 2018 took 175 days to complete before beginning to reverse. The one in 2021-22 took 413 days.\n\nHence, an argument could be made that as the market matures the cycle duration also lengthens, while the magnitude of gains (in percentage terms) reduces.\n\nTaking this logic forward, the next run could take much longer than 400 days, and it was unclear just how high the total crypto market cap could reach.\n\nA conservative estimate based on the Fib extension levels plotted in the chart above showed that $5T was possible, but much higher gains are possible too.\n\nExamining the state of the altcoin king\n\nIt is a widely held belief that an ETH rally comes alongside an altcoin market-wide rally. Therefore, taking a look at how Ethereum is shaping up could be helpful.\n\nIn the long-term, meaning over the next two years, a large price appreciation across the market seems inevitable.\n\nIn the coming weeks, however, it would be prudent for ETH holders to book some profits. The MVRV ratio was climbing toward the early 2023 highs.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nThis meant that a large chunk of ETH holders were sitting on unrealized profits. This could add to any selling pressure Ethereum faces as they look to book profits.\n\nTherefore, Ethereum could experience some turbulence in the next month or two as the high MVRV ratio readjusts. Yet, based on the earlier evidence, the crypto market seemed headed inexorably higher."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder and developer Vitalik Buterin has proposed a new concept of \u2018enshrined zkEVM\u2019 for addressing Ethereum scalability.\n\nIn his latest blogpost, the Ethereum core developer said that a zero-knowledge EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) could efficiently be implemented directly on Ethereum layer 2 networks, which use both optimistic and zero-knowledge (zk) rollups.\n\nVitalik describes that the current layer 2 protocols on Ethereum heavily rely on EVM execution and verification with a large set of codebases.\n\nIf the codebase of these layer 2 protocols contains any bugs, it puts the whole network at risk of being hacked.\n\nHe further said that these layer 2 projects mostly provide the functionality already available on Ethereum, and in addition, Ethereum governance could implement changes to the network.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s light clients are getting more powerful, it is expected that ZK-SNARKs will be fully operational on EVM for data verification and transaction executions over the next few years. Vitalik believes that at that time, Ethereum will eventually have a built-in zkEVM, so it could also be available for rollups as well.\n\nAccording to Vitalik, the proposed zkEVM needs to have certain key properties so that it can efficiently address scalability.\n\nIt requires compatibility \u2013with Ethereum\u2019s multi-client system including data availability and proof verification for different clients\u2013 , upgradability, and support for all EVM-based infrastructures.\n\n\u201cThe most important property [\u2026] is speed,\u201d said Vitalik, adding\n\n\u201cWhile it is possible to design an in-protocol ZK-EVM feature that is asynchronous, returning an answer for each claim only after a delay of N slots.\n\nthe problem becomes much easier if we can reliably guarantee that a proof can be generated within a few seconds, so whatever happens in each block is self-contained.\u201d\n\nVitalik has also delved into many technical aspects of an ideal zkEVM, which are largely inherited by current layer 2 networks.\n\nHowever, the implementation of zkEVM on Ethereum does not replace the need for layer 2 networks, as \u201clayer 2 projects would still be responsible for many important functions,\u201d such as high-speed confirmations and MEV mitigations, while maintaining a user and developer-friendly environment infrastructure."

(Wasn't due until Dec 23rd I think) pic.twitter.com/jFCjnND3Rf advertisement \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 13, 2023\n\nThe Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF\n\nInvesco joined the race for crypto ETF in September to roll out the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, a joint effort with Galaxy Digital Funds. This ETF was meant to hold Ethereum (ETH) directly so that it is distinct from several Ethereum futures ETFs that are preparing to go live very soon.\n\nNotably, Invesco and Galaxy had earlier filed for a joint physically-backed Bitcoin ETF before finally retracting the application.\n\n\u201cWe have determined not to pursue the launch of a Bitcoin futures ETF in the immediate near-term; however, we will continue to work in partnership with Galaxy Digital to offer investors a full shelf of products with exposure to this transformative asset class, including pursuing a physically backed, digital asset ETF,\u201d Invesco explained.\n\nIt is, however, a major contender for Ethereum spot ETF, a truly dynamic twist.\n\nSEC Delays Multiple ETF Applications\n\nIn terms of the delay, Invesco is not the only asset manager that has received such news from the SEC about its application. A week ago, the SEC announced a 45-day extension for its decision on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust\u2019s application for a spot ETF. This meant that its expected verdict by December 6, 2023, was no longer valid, rather the new deadline was moved to January 25, 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, the SEC has requested feedback from the public on Fidelity\u2019s proposed rule change for a similar product and the asset manager is still expecting a verdict from the regulator.\n\nAlso, the broad crypto industry is waiting for a decision from the SEC on the spot Bitcoin ETF applications made by BlackRock, Fidelity, WisdomTree, and many other companies. It is barely four weeks away from the short approval window the SEC has to approve the batch of due applications in January.\n\nThe anticipation is building intensely and crypto proponents are still very positive that the regulator will rule favorably on these applications and possibly mark the first time that a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved in the United States."

        "content": "In the thrilling world of cryptocurrencies, the spotlight is currently on Ethereum (ETH) as it approaches a critical price level, while Hedera (HBAR) and the new memecoin on the block, Rebel Satoshi (RBLZ), are creating a buzz among investors. This trio of digital assets is demonstrating why they\u2019re considered top cryptos to buy, with Ethereum and Hedera making significant moves in the blockchain space and Rebel Satoshi emerging as a hot new memecoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) Pivotal Moment\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is currently at a make-or-break point. The crypto giant is nearing critical Fibonacci (Fib) levels between $2,400 and $2,600, a phase that could define its market trajectory in the near term. ETH has already impressively surpassed its previous high of around $2,140 and is now eyeing the next Fib levels. However, it could face some bearish resistance, leading to a possible corrective phase before any further upward movement.\n\nThe Ethereum market is buzzing with anticipation. If ETH starts to outperform Bitcoin (BTC), we might see its price shooting up to the $3,400 mark. A lot of this depends on the ETH/BTC pair dynamics, which investors are watching like hawks. The recent bullish signs in Ethereum\u2019s monthly MACD histogram and its neutral RSI are fueling this optimism, making Ethereum a top crypto to buy for those eyeing potential significant gains.\n\nHedera (HBAR): The New Blockchain Champion\n\nHedera (HBAR) is quietly but powerfully making its mark in the crypto universe. Known for its Hashgraph consensus mechanism, Hedera boasts transaction finality in just 3.43 seconds and an average transaction cost of a mere $0.0001. These impressive stats make it one of the fastest and most cost-effective blockchains around, setting it up for potential mass adoption.\n\nHedera\u2019s focus on servicing institutions and companies in the stablecoin and micropayment solution sectors could be a game-changer. This strategic decision is particularly savvy, given the increasing popularity of stablecoins. With over 30 billion network transactions under its belt, Hedera is proving that its strategy is more than just talk. The recent announcement of its partnership with Empowa Pay in Africa further solidifies Hedera\u2019s status as a top altcoin to buy and a formidable force in the crypto space.\n\nRebel Satoshi (RBLZ): The Memecoin Causing a Stir\n\nOn the memecoin front, Rebel Satoshi (RBLZ) is stirring up a frenzy among investors. Drawing inspiration from the legendary Satoshi Nakamoto and the historical figure Guy Fawkes, Rebel Satoshi is not just another memecoin; it\u2019s a movement with a mission.\n\nInnovative Tokenomics and Community Driven\n\nRebel Satoshi\u2019s deflationary token model, which includes a token burning mechanism, is designed to gradually reduce its supply, thereby potentially increasing its value over time. This strategic approach is positioning Rebel Satoshi as a smart investment choice, emerging as one of the best memecoins to buy.\n\nWhat sets Rebel Satoshi apart is its focus on community engagement and empowerment. Holding RBLZ tokens gives investors a say in the platform\u2019s future, creating a sense of ownership and involvement.

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum Classic price breaching $22 would mark a bullish signal for the altcoin, which could push it towards marking fresh year-to-date highs.\n\nThe Ethereum Classic network is set to undergo the \u2018Spiral\u2019 upgrade, a hard fork that will set it at par with Ethereum Shanghai changes.\n\nScheduled for the end of January 2024, ETC will likely witness a bullish momentum by then.\n\nEthereum Classic price took a hit this week, along with the rest of the market, nearly falling by 17.4% in a day. However, as the altcoin recovered slightly, it lost the bullish momentum that had been building up in the week before. This momentum will likely revive in the next year.\n\nEthereum Classic to undergo major upgrade\n\nEthereum Classic network is scheduled for a hard fork on January 31, 2024. The upgrade titled \u2018Spiral\u2019 will be activated at block 19,250,000. This upgrade will be a compatibility upgrade for the Ethereum hard fork chain, which will bring it in line with the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nIn order to be an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chain, the blockchain would need to meet the EVM standards. Thus, the Spiral Upgrade will bring the ETC Network to parity with upstream EVM standards, facilitating contract development and migration.\n\nThis upgrade will most likely act as a catalyst since, for the large part, the market would already be experiencing bullishness thanks to the broader market cues.\n\nEthereum Classic price rise revival\n\nEthereum Classic price, trading at $19.94 at the time of writing, was down by 2% over the past day, adding to the 8% decline observed this week. While ETC has lost nearly half the gains it noted towards October end, it is yet to witness a bearish momentum in full swing.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still hovering above the neutral line marked at 50.0, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has only just marked the bearish crossover. But the chances of a rally will only arrive after ETC has first declined to $19.1.\n\nOnly after bouncing back from this line can the Ethereum Classic price note some recovery, but if the bearish cues heavily weigh the price down, the altcoin could fall to $18.2.\n\nETC/USD 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if broader market cues and investors act bullish to prevent a price decline before the new year begins, ETC might have a shot at early recovery. Breaching the $20.9 resistance level would confirm the same and invalidate the bearish thesis, pushing the Ethereum hard fork toward $22.4."

        "content": "Bitget Wallet, formerly known as BitKeep, a Web3 trading wallet, has recently unveiled a strategic collaboration with the Ethereum Layer 2 network, Linea. The partnership aims to propel the development and expansion of the Linea ecosystem, marking a step towards enhancing Ethereum's usability.\n\nBitget Wallet's Integration with Linea Unveiled\n\nBitget Wallet has integrated with the Linea mainnet, offering users enhanced wallet connectivity and support for Linea's mainnet and associated projects. This integration allows Bitget Wallet users to access the Linea mainnet via their mobile app and browser extension. Users can manage assets on the Linea ecosystem, partake in multi-chain swaps for Linea mainnet tokens, access real-time candlestick data, and engage with projects within the Linea ecosystem.\n\nAlvin Kan\n\nLinea, developed by ConsenSys leverages zero-knowledge proof technology to provide efficient scaling solutions for Ethereum. The collaboration between Bitget Wallet and Linea includes the launch of the \"DeFi Voyage\" event on Bitget Wallet's Task2Get platform. This event marks the initiation of the second phase of Bitget Wallet's Task2Get initiative, allowing users to explore the Linea ecosystem within the wallet.\n\nTask2Get, an incentive platform introduced by Bitget Wallet, rewards users for participating in various on-chain interaction tasks. This initiative offers users the opportunity to both learn and earn from diverse ecosystems.\n\nKeep Reading Kraken Unveils New Platform for Institutional Clients amid ETF Boost\n\nAlvin Kan, the Chief Operating Officer of Bitget Wallet, emphasized the company's commitment to actively participating in the Web3 ecosystem. He stated: \"This will allow users to explore and interact with decentralized ecosystems while earning rewards at the same time.\"\n\nBitget's $30 Million Infusion: A Capital Leap for BitKeep's Transformation\n\nThe collaboration with Linea is poised to further solidify Task2Get's role in fostering market growth. Finance Magnates reported earlier that after amassing 10 million users from nearly 170 countries over five years, the multi-chain non-custodial crypto wallet BitKeep has rebranded as Bitget Wallet following its acquisition and a $30 million capital infusion from Bitget in March.\n\nBitget introduced Bitget Swap, an intelligent DEX aggregation service across 100 DEXs, providing optimal prices and best-in-class liquidity. This feature integrates seamlessly with other platform elements like token management, NFT Market, DApp Browser, and Launchpad, eliminating the need for external platforms.\n\nBitget Wallet sees this transformation as a milestone in embracing the future of Web3 trading, offering faster transactions, unmatched DEX aggregation, and seamless cross-chain convenience. The Middle East, particularly the UAE and Bahrain, is becoming a focal point for crypto ambitions. Bitget has established a presence in downtown Dubai, riding the wave of the region's 400% increase in crypto-oriented businesses in the past two years.\n\nThe MENA region's crypto uptake represents 9.2% of global transactions, making it the fastest-growing digital currency sector. Bitget joins other exchanges in recognizing the region's potential and securing licenses to participate in the digital asset market."

        "content": "Staking is a process where cryptocurrency holders lock up their assets to support the operations of a blockchain network, earning rewards in return.\n\nHowever, traditional staking has limitations \u2013 the inability to utilize staked assets for other purposes while they are locked up. Liquid staking addresses this constraint by providing a flexible solution that allows users to convert their staked assets into fungible tokens, enabling liquidity and accessibility to a broader range of financial opportunities.\n\nLiquid staking platforms such as Lido Finance, utilize advanced protocols to issue tokenized representations of staked assets. These tokens, often referred to as staked tokens, can be freely traded, lent, or used as collateral on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.\n\nUsers benefit from the best of both worlds \u2013 participating in the network\u2019s staking activities while retaining the flexibility to engage in a variety of decentralized financial activities.\n\nLido\n\nLido is the leading liquid staking solution on Ethereum \u2013 providing a simple way for users to get rewards on their digital tokens. By staking with Lido, the user\u2019s tokens remain liquid and can be used across a range of DeFi applications, getting extra rewards.\n\nWhile the platform provides staking for multiple blockchain networks, most notably it is a liquid staking solution for Ethereum, allowing users to stake their $ETH and receive stETH (Lido staked $ETH) tokens in exchange. These tokens represent the user\u2019s staked $ETH and staking rewards.\n\nFollowing Ethereum\u2019s shift to Proof of Stake (PoS), individuals wishing to serve as staking validators can engage in the process by depositing a minimum of 32 $ETH, which represents a relatively high entry threshold. However, Lido enables users to participate with smaller fractions of Ether (any amount) and still receive block rewards at 3.4% in Annualized Percentage Rate(APR).\n\nstETH tokens, which are ERC-20 compatible, are minted as soon as funds are deposited into Lido\u2019s staking pool smart contract and burned as soon as users withdraw their $ETH tokens.\n\nTo stake your Ether on Lido Finance, you will be required to connect an Ethereum wallet on this page.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n________________________________________\n\n________________________________________"

It is an initial step for the implementation of Danksharding which introduces blobs to store data and improve block capacity temporarily until EVM execution.\n\nJPMorgan analysts say that this upgrade is very beneficial for Ethereum layer 2 networks such as Optimism and Arbitrum, as it improves network throughput while reducing fees.\n\nWhile referring to the bullish stance for Bitcoin, analysts said that the driving factors \u2013 such as optimism around spot Bitcoin ETFs and upcoming halving in April 2024 \u2013 are already priced in, hence a huge upsurge in Bitcoin price is blurry.\n\n\u201cGiven the current ratio of the bitcoin price to production cost is around x2.0 at the moment, this would imply that the 2024 bitcoin halving event is largely in the price,\u201d said analysts."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum price dropped close to the $2,100 level early on Wednesday, entering a crucial demand zone.\n\nOver 5.58 million wallet addresses hold nearly 40 million Ethereum tokens in the demand zone.\n\nAnalysts have predicted an ETH price rally to $3,000 since Ethereum\u2019s breakout past the $2,000 level.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, declined to $2,148 early on Wednesday. The fall in prices follows a broader sell-off in the crypto market since Monday, likely driven by investors\u2019 de-risking strategy ahead of a macro-packed week, with US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) last meeting of the year.\n\nEthereum price has entered a critical demand zone, according to on-chain metrics, in which market catalysts could help determine where ETH is headed next.\n\nAlso read: XRP price drop to $0.55 likely amidst Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s final push in US crypto legislation\n\nEthereum price reaches demand zone\n\nBased on data from crypto intelligence tracker IntoTheBlock, Ethereum price has dipped into a demand zone considered crucial for the altcoin. The price range between $1,934 and $2,160 is key for Ethereum price as this is a range where 5.58 million wallet addresses accumulated nearly 40 million ETH tokens.\n\nThis makes the demand zone a critical support for ETH. According to Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), this makes it an ideal reloading point for traders looking to add more Ethereum to their portfolio before the altcoin\u2019s price rallies.\n\nGlobal In/Out of the Money ETH.

        "title": "Ethereum Price History: Key Events and Their Effects - The Tribune India",
        "content": "Understanding how the Ethereum price has changed can be confusing. This digital currency started at just $0.42 in 2015 and soared to astonishing heights over the years. Our blog will guide you through Ethereum's journey, examining key events that caused its dramatic price shifts.\n\nGet ready for a thrilling ride into the world of Ethereum!\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nEthereum started at $0.42 in 2015 and reached a high of $4,780.73 in 2021, showing huge growth.\n\nEvents like the DAO hack in 2016 and the start of Ethereum 2.0 affected its price a lot.\n\nThe adoption of Ethereum by more people and businesses has helped its price go up over time.\n\nOther digital currencies are competition for Ethereum and can change its price too.\n\nTechnology upgrades to the Ethereum system have also played a big part in how much it's worth.\n\nEthereum Price History\n\nIn the last few years, Ethereum has experienced significant price fluctuations, starting from a low of $0.42 in 2015 to reaching an all-time high of $4,780.73 in 2021. These fluctuations have been influenced by various key events and factors that have shaped the cryptocurrency's price history.\n\n2015: Starting Price of $0.42 and reaching $1.39\n\nEthereum began its journey in 2015 at a modest price of $0.42. This was a time when the idea of using blockchain for more than just digital currency was new. As people learned about Ethereum's potential beyond Bitcoin, excitement grew.\n\nQuickly, this interest pushed the price up to $1.39 by the end of the year.\n\nMany saw Ethereum as an innovation in blockchain technology that could lead to many other uses. These early days were vital because they set the stage for Ethereum's future growth and effect on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEven with such small numbers compared to later prices, these shifts were key moments in crypto trading history.\n\n2016: First hard fork and price hitting $21.25\n\nFollowing the price range from $0.42 to $1.39 in 2015, Ethereum encountered a significant milestone in 2016 with its first hard fork and a consequent surge in price, reaching $21.25.\n\nThis event marked a crucial moment for Ethereum\u2019s technological development and its impact on market valuation.\n\nThe hard fork, executed to reverse the loss of funds due to the DAO hack, stirred considerable attention within the cryptocurrency community and signaled Ethereum's responsiveness to challenges.\n\n2017: Becoming mainstream and reaching $881.94\n\nFollowing the first hard fork and Ethereum's price hitting $21.25, 2017 marked a significant turning point for Ethereum as it began to gain mainstream attention and adoption. This surge in popularity drove its price to reach a remarkable high of $881.94, reflecting the growing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s potential and its increasing use across various sectors such as finance, technology, and even governance.\n\nThe demand for decentralized applications built on the Ethereum platform contributed to this surge in value, cementing Ethereum's position as one of the leading cryptocurrencies at that time.\n\nThe increased utilization of smart contracts and the expansion of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) market further propelled its growth during this period.\n\n2018: Breaking $1k barrier with a price of $1,119.37\n\nEthereum made a significant leap in 2018, surpassing the $1k mark with a price of $1,119.37. This milestone marked a substantial increase from its earlier values and showcased the growing interest and investment in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe surge reflected the escalating demand for Ethereum and indicated a turning point in its value trajectory amidst evolving digital currency trends.\n\nThe breakthrough of Ethereum crossing the $1k barrier to reach $1,119.37 highlighted its increasing prominence within the cryptocurrency landscape, underlining shifts in investor sentiment, and signaling heightened potential for digital assets' market valuations.\n\n2019: Uneventful year with prices ranging from $102.93 to $361.40\n\nIn 2019, Ethereum experienced a relatively stable year with prices fluctuating between $102.93 and $361.40. This period lacked significant market-shifting events or major price surges, leading to a sense of stability compared to the volatility of previous years.\n\nThe range showcased a tempered market, lacking extreme fluctuations that had characterized earlier years.\n\nMarket analysis during this time indicated a period of consolidation and relative calm in Ethereum's price movements, setting the stage for developments and potential shifts in the coming years, as the cryptocurrency continued to establish its position within the digital asset market.\n\n2020: The effects of the coronavirus with a price range of $95.18 to $533.00\n\nThe year 2020 brought significant challenges to Ethereum, with the outbreak of the coronavirus leading to a wide price range between $95.18 and $533.00. The pandemic-induced market volatility had a pronounced impact on cryptocurrency prices, including Ethereum, as investor sentiment fluctuated in response to global economic uncertainty and rapidly changing circumstances.\n\nThe effects of the coronavirus underscored the susceptibility of digital currencies to external factors beyond traditional market forces. The resulting price range from $95.18 to $533.00 reflected this heightened volatility and demonstrated the interconnectedness of global events with cryptocurrency markets, highlighting the need for resilience and adaptability in this evolving financial landscape.\n\n2021: Epic bull run with a high of $4,780.73\n\nIn 2021, Ethereum experienced a remarkable surge in its value, reaching an all-time high of $4,780.73. This unprecedented bull run captivated the cryptocurrency market and solidified Ethereum's position as a leading digital asset.\n\nThe substantial price increase was fueled by growing institutional interest, decentralized finance (DeFi) developments, and increased adoption across various industries.\n\nEthereum's extraordinary performance in 2021 reflected the increasing confidence in blockchain technology and decentralized applications like smart contracts and NFTs. This significant milestone marked a pivotal moment for Ethereum and highlighted its potential to revolutionize traditional financial systems while shaping the future of digital currencies.\n\nKey Moments in Ethereum Price History\n\nThe beginning of Ethereum in 2013, The DAO hack in 2016, the bull run of 2017 and challenges and price fluctuations from 2018 to the present have all shaped Ethereum's price history.\n\nTo delve deeper into these key moments and their effects on Ethereum prices, keep reading!\n\nThe beginning of Ethereum in 2013\n\nEthereum, a decentralized platform that enables smart contracts and Distributed Applications (DApps) to be built and operated without any downtime or fraud was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013.\n\nEthereum's development was crowdfunded in August 2014, with the system going live on July 30, 2015. This event marked a significant milestone in the history of digital currencies as it introduced new capabilities and potential use cases beyond Bitcoin's peer-to-peer electronic cash system.\n\nThe DAO hack in 2016\n\nIn 2016, a significant event shook the Ethereum community: the DAO hack. This incident led to the theft of around $50 million worth of Ether, causing a major crisis and leading to a contentious hard fork that resulted in two separate blockchains \u2013 Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nThe impact of this hack was felt throughout the cryptocurrency market, raising concerns about security and leading to price fluctuations as investor confidence wavered.\n\nMoving forward from the DAO hack in 2016, the bull run of 2017 brought renewed optimism and increased interest in Ethereum as its price surged significantly.\n\nThe bull run of 2017\n\nIn 2017, Ethereum experienced a remarkable bull run, with its price soaring to an all-time high of $881.94. This surge was largely fueled by the growing popularity of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum platform, propelling investor demand and optimism in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe surge also reflected a broader trend in the digital asset market as a whole, with Bitcoin reaching new record highs and garnering significant mainstream attention.\n\nThe extraordinary rise in Ethereum's value during this period can be attributed to increased adoption and recognition of its underlying technology within both crypto circles and traditional financial sectors, marking a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.\n\nChallenges and price fluctuations from 2018 to the present\n\nFollowing the epic bull run of 2017, Ethereum encountered various challenges and price fluctuations from 2018 to the present. The cryptocurrency market witnessed heightened volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and scalability concerns.\n\nAdditionally, intense competition from emerging cryptocurrencies also impacted Ethereum's price movements. These factors led to significant price oscillations, creating a rollercoaster effect on Ethereum's value in the digital currency market.\n\nThe fluctuating prices were further influenced by technological upgrades and developments within the decentralized finance sector, impacting investor sentiment and demand for Ethereum.\n\nFactors Influencing Ethereum Prices\n\nAdoption and mainstream use, investor sentiment and demand, competition from other cryptocurrencies, and technological developments and upgrades all play significant roles in influencing Ethereum prices.\n\nUnderstanding these factors can provide insights into the cryptocurrency market trends and help investors make informed decisions.\n\nAdoption and mainstream use\n\nEthereum's price history has been significantly influenced by its adoption and mainstream use. As more people and businesses began using Ethereum for transactions, the demand for the cryptocurrency increased, resulting in price surges.\n\nThe integration of Ethereum into various industries and the growing acceptance of it as a method of payment have also contributed to its increased mainstream use, further impacting its price movements.\n\nThe widespread adoption of Ethereum within decentralized finance (DeFi) applications has played a crucial role in driving its prices, reflecting how its real-world utility affects market trends.\n\nInvestor sentiment and demand\n\nInvestor sentiment and demand greatly impact Ethereum's price. When investors feel optimistic about the future of Ethereum, they tend to buy more, increasing demand and driving prices up.\n\nOn the other hand, if they become cautious or uncertain, they may sell their holdings, causing a decrease in demand and a drop in prices. These fluctuations in investor sentiment can lead to significant price movements for Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies, impacting the overall market trends and digital asset market developments.\n\nCompetition from other cryptocurrencies\n\nAs we consider the influence of other cryptocurrencies, it's important to recognize that Ethereum faces competition from various digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ripple, and Litecoin.\n\nEach cryptocurrency offers unique features and use cases that can impact Ethereum's market share and price. Investors closely monitor developments in these competing cryptocurrencies as they weigh their investment options within the digital asset market trends.\n\nIn the decentralized finance market, a crucial factor affecting Ethereum prices is its ability to stand out amidst the growing number of alternative blockchain projects striving for similar goals.\n\nTechnological developments and upgrades\n\nEthereum's price history has been influenced by technological advancements and upgrades. The implementation of Ethereum 2.0, which includes the shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, has been a significant development impacting the price.\n\nAdditionally, upgrades like EIP-1559 have aimed to address issues with transaction fees and supply dynamics, directly affecting Ethereum's market trends and historical price movements.\n\nThese technological developments and upgrades continue to play a pivotal role in shaping Ethereum's future price trajectory and market dynamics. The evolution of these technologies will likely remain an essential factor in analyzing Ethereum's historical data and predicting its future price fluctuations.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, Ethereum's price history reflects significant milestones and events that have shaped its value over the years. From humble beginnings in 2015 to the epic bull run of 2021, Ethereum has experienced dramatic price fluctuations influenced by key moments like the DAO hack and technological developments.\n\nFactors such as mainstream adoption, investor sentiment, and competition from other cryptocurrencies continue to impact Ethereum's price trajectory, making it a dynamic asset in the digital currency landscape.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is part of sponsored content programme.

According to Eric Balchunas, a senior Bloomberg analyst, BlackRock has made the first step towards filing for an Ether Spot ETF with the SEC, and Ethereum Classic investors reacted positively to this development.\n\nAs a result of this move, Ethereum Classic and top altcoins associated with Ether recorded price surges in the first week of December. On December 2, ETC traded at $19.01. A week later, ETC gained 16.47% and sold for $22.08.

        "title": "Solana's Ambitious $2,000 Price Target Could Flip Ethereum and Bitcoin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The crypto market has experienced exciting new developments that have excited investors and traders alike. Key market movers, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have gained about 127% and 70%, respectively, since the start of 2023. However, Solana has made quite an impression, surging over 500% in value, and is currently traded at around $70.\n\nSolana is showing no signs of slowing down as it makes an ambitious move to reach $2,000 in the coming bull run. This will likely excite SOL holders and potentially challenge the crypto giants, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Today\u2019s post will discuss more on Solana\u2019s ambitious price target and how certain new coins, such as Bitcoin ETF token, Bitcoin Minetrix, and others, are poised to revolutionize the crypto market in the coming year. Without further ado, let\u2019s dive in!\n\n>>>Buy the Best Presale Token Now<<<\n\nBitcoin ETF Token: A Revolutionary Crypto Project Tied to Upcoming Bitcoin ETF Approvals\n\nBitcoin ETF token positions itself as a gateway for investors eager to tap into the anticipated spot Bitcoin ETFs. This crypto project incorporates a deflationary mechanism tied to the progress of upcoming spot approvals. At specific milestones, portions of its native token, BTCETF, will be burned, potentially driving its value higher.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin ETF Now<<<\n\nThe project\u2019s roadmap outlines five pivotal milestones, which include:\n\n$100 million in BTCETF trading volume\n\nFirst spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the US\n\nFirst US spot Bitcoin ETF launch\n\n$1 billion in assets under management across Bitcoin ETFs\n\nBitcoin price to reach $100,000\n\nEach milestone triggers a 5% burn, totaling a 25% reduction in the token supply over time, thus boosting the project\u2019s inherent value. BTCETF also introduces a staking system, encouraging users to deposit tokens to enjoy passive earnings of up to 78% APY (Annual Percentage Yield).\n\nNotably, its ongoing presale has created a buzz in the crypto community. With 40% of the total supply allocated to the presale, early investors stand to gain substantial rewards. The presale has gained momentum, which has resulted in over $3.5 million raised so far. It also adopts a tier-based approach, featuring ten stages with progressively higher token prices. Do well to check out this project as soon as possible to enjoy impressive gains during the upcoming bull run.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin ETF Now<<<\n\nBitcoin Minetrix: A World-Class Bitcoin Mining Platform\n\nBitcoin mining has posed barriers to entry for many due to the need for specialized hardware and high power consumption. However, Bitcoin Minetrix aims to change the narrative by providing a cloud-based mining solution, thus allowing anyone to participate using their personal computers or mobile devices.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nThe stake-to-mine system introduced by Bitcoin Minetrix involves staking its native token, BTCMTX, to earn mining credits. These credits can be burned to acquire cloud mining power, allowing you to mine Bitcoin effortlessly. You can monitor your mining activity and verify rewards on the blockchain through the platform\u2019s dashboard without intermediaries.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix further distinguishes itself by incorporating a decentralized staking system, allowing you to enjoy passive APY rewards of over 100%. The success of Bitcoin Minetrix is evident in its presale, surpassing $5 million in funding. It underscores the platform\u2019s potential to revolutionize the cloud mining industry, making Bitcoin mining accessible to everyone.\n\nIts ongoing presale offers BTCMTX tokens at $0.0121 per token, presenting a strategic opportunity for investors considering potential price appreciation upon listing. With the upcoming bull run in view, Bitcoin Minetrix invites you to participate in the cloud mining revolutionization by engaging in its presale early on to enjoy premium gains in the coming year.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\nGreen Bitcoin: A Rewarding Bitcoin Predictive Platform\n\nGreen Bitcoin is a premier crypto project that pioneers a Bitcoin price prediction reward system. By staking Green Bitcoin\u2019s native token, GBTC, participants can predict Bitcoin\u2019s price, and accurate predictions are met with enticing rewards. Though the game is yet to go live, you can secure GBTC tokens at a discounted rate in its ongoing presale.\n\nIts tokenomics allocates 40% to the presale and 27.5% to staking rewards, ensuring over half of the total supply benefits early supporters. As you purchase your GBTC, you can enjoy staking rewards of up to 698% APY, which diminishes as more tokens are staked. Therefore, early participation is key to securing more passive rewards. With the expected bull run, Green Bitcoin offers you a chance to have a share in Bitcoin prediction and exciting investment opportunities.\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nSolana\u2019s Bold Move To $2,000: What This Could Mean For Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nSolana has emerged as a formidable contender, boldly setting its sights on an ambitious $2,000 price target. This audacious goal presents intriguing implications for industry stalwarts Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nSolana has made quite the show, with its impressive 500+% surge in the past 12 months, positioning itself as the preferred choice for institutional investors seeking Bitcoin alternatives. As a result, there is a significant shift in capital flows away from Ethereum toward Solana. As institutional money aligns with Solana\u2019s bullish performance, there\u2019s a massive upside potential for this project. So, what will this new $2,000 price mean for the crypto market?\n\nA $2,000 price point for Solana could mean over 840 billion market cap. This will place Solana a close second to Bitcoin\u2019s market cap and double that of Ethereum if the two cryptos return to their All-Time High prices of $68,800 and $4,200, respectively. While this ambitious price set by Solana is under speculation, the crypto community is eager to see the long-term price action of this spirited altcoin.\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nWrapping it Up: Take Advantage of the New Cryptos Poised For Revolutionary Gains\n\nSolana\u2019s ambitious price move can reshape the entire crypto space. However, it is noteworthy that SOL\u2019s $2,000 price target is purely speculative and should be handled cautiously. As the market gears up for a new market year, it is vital to note that the new coins we\u2019ve discussed are still in their nascent stages, armed with impressive use cases and ready to dominate the crypto market.

        "content": "Today\u2019s edition is brought to you by Uniswap \u2013 the largest onchain marketplace for digital assets \u2014 and now Android and iOS users have the power of Uniswap in their pocket.\n\nDownload the Uniswap mobile app today!\n\nGM. This is Milk Road. We\u2019re the Home Depot of crypto. We help you build a solid foundation for your crypto journey.\n\nHere\u2019s what we got for you today:\n\nGraphs of the day \ud83d\udcca\n\n\ud83d\udea8WARNING: Crypto dApps are under attack! \ud83d\udea8\n\nNew accounting rules for crypto \ud83c\udf6a\n\nPrices as of 8:00 AM ET. Click here for our Fear & Greed Index\n\nGRAPHS OF THE DAY \ud83d\udcca\n\nWe\u2019ve got 3 graphs for you today\u2026\n\n1/ ETH\u2019S SUPPLY IS DECREASING\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: ETH\u2019s supply is at its lowest level in 455 days (aka since the Merge).\n\nThis is due to 2 reasons\u2026\n\na/ The Merge \u2013 a big software update that moved Ethereum from PoW (Proof-of-Work) \u2014> PoS (Proof-Of-Stake) last year.\n\nBecause of it, Ethereum now uses 99.9% less energy than before and the annual emission of new ETH dropped from over 4% \u2192 less than 1%.\n\nLess energy to run = less block rewards for stakers = less new ETH coming into the supply.\n\nb/ Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism (EIP-1559) \u2013 part of every transaction on the Ethereum network gets \u201cburned\u201d and removed from circulation forever.\n\nMix the two together (less annual ETH emission + a burn mechanism) and you get\u2026 a deflationary asset.\n\nAs a result:\n\nETH\u2019s annual supply change is currently -0.21% . Basically, more ETH is being burned than issued.\n\nETH\u2019s supply has decreased by 315,400. In other words, there\u2019s ~$725M less ETH in supply than before.\n\nWhy this matters: While ETH has lacked in price action recently (due to lack of demand vs other tokens), this highlights that once demand returns to Ethereum, the supply mechanics are much stronger than last cycle and could eventually lead to a big rally.\n\n2/ Layer 1 tokens are outperforming the rest\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: Layer 1 tokens (like SOL, AVAX, ADA, etc.) have been outperforming Layer 2s and DeFi tokens over the last month.\n\nOn average, L1\u2019s are up ~50% while L2\u2019s and DeFi tokens are only up ~10%.\n\nWhy this matters: The Layer 1 rotation from last cycle is making a comeback.\n\nYou see, during the last bull run, a lot of people moved between different L1\u2019s like Solana, Avalanche, Terra, etc.\n\nFast forward to today, it\u2019s happening again. Except this time\u2026\n\nTerra is gone (R.I.P.) and other L1s like Injective, Celestia, etc. have entered the race.\n\nSolana and Avalanche have stronger ecosystems and more network activity than before (SOL: payments, DePIN, etc.; AVAX: Real World Assets, crypto gaming, etc.).\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see how the L1 race plays out over the next few months.\n\n3/ Bitcoin had its 3rd worst single-day sell off this year\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: Earlier this week, Bitcoin dropped from $44K \u2192 under $41K within 24 hours (-5.75%).\n\nIt was the 3rd largest sell-off this entire year. Ouchie.\n\nWhy this matters: If Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped this much a few months back, there\u2019s a good chance that it could\u2019ve gone even lower\u2026\n\nBut the fact that Bitcoin\u2019s price held strong (and even recovered a bit) highlights that we\u2019re in a \u201chealthier\u201d market now.\n\nUNISWAP FROM THE COMFORT OF YOUR POCKET There\u2019s one major hurdle standing in between our industry and mass adoption: the user experience of crypto apps. Between navigating different blockchains and storing seed phrases, onboarding newcomers to DeFi gets complicated, so people have been holding off.

        "content": "In the dynamic realm of digital finance, cryptocurrency has emerged as a revolutionary force, redefining traditional concepts of currency and investment. Among several cryptocurrencies, Ethereum stands out as innovative, showcasing the transformative potential that this technology brings to the table.\n\nThe Importance of Cryptocurrency:\n\nAt its core, cryptocurrency is not merely a digital form of money but a powerful tool that operates on decentralized blockchain technology. Ethereum, in particular, has distinguished itself by introducing smart contracts, a feature that has far-reaching implications across various industries.

        "title": "Fast Growing Cryptos that Could Moon? Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche and the growing ApeMax Presale - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency space has witnessed high growth and expansion over the years, as crypto has morphed from a niche segment to a thriving ecosystem with an extensive number of coins and tokens. Although past growth spurs were heralded by Bitcoin and later Ethereum during the most recent bull market, nowadays newer and younger generation coins are also gaining momentum and growing in popularity.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look at some of the fast growing crypto coins and the expanding presale of new token ApeMax. This piece discusses each coin in detail after having researched these tokens in depth and collected information on them from a number of different crypto publications and first hand accounts.\n\nTop Fast Growing Cryptos and Fast Growing Presales\n\nApeMax (APEMAX)\n\nApeMax takes the spotlight as the world\u2019s first \u201cBoost-to-Earn\u201d crypto coin, introducing an interesting staking mechanism. Currently available at presale for a limited time, ApeMax offers purchasers immediate access to their tokens, meaning they can also start enjoying the coin\u2019s utility from the get-go. The ApeMax presale has been growing with new eligible holders getting their ApeMax coins daily.\n\nGoing beyond other new coins in presale, ApeMax users can engage in boost staking immediately, with the possibility to earn token rewards through staking. For a short duration, discount loot boxes are up for grabs by eligible token buyers.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum secures its place as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Functioning as a blockchain platform, Ethereum facilitates the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and the execution of smart contracts.\n\nWhile Ethereum has a proven track record, there is ongoing speculation about its sustained position, prompting discussions about potential challengers. Ethereum is up by over 70% over the year and this coin has experienced tremendous growth from its inception to its heights during the NFT bull market.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nDesigned for high-speed and high-volume transactions, Solana offers a more scalable and efficient alternative to other blockchain networks. Despite its technical prowess, Solana faced setbacks linked to its association with Sam Bankman-Fried, the controversial founder of FTX.\n\nHowever, if Solana can overcome technical hurdles, it could rival other smart contract chains like ETH, external analysts say. Solana took a big hit following FTX winding down, but has since made a rebound and is up by over 400% over the last 12 months and up by over 28% in the last 30 days alone.\n\nPolygon (MATIC)\n\nFormerly known as Matic Network, Polygon provides scalable and interoperable infrastructure for building decentralized applications. As a \u201clayer two\u201d to the Ethereum network, Polygon\u2019s low-cost structure has contributed to its widespread adoption, creating a robust network effect that has fueled its growth.\n\nFrom an early price of $0.00547046 in late April 2019 to its height of $2.88 on the 27th of December 2021, Polygon Matic\u2019s price grew by over 50,000%.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nAvalanche offers a decentralized infrastructure for building dApps and executing smart contracts. Distinguished by its use of subnets, Avalanche\u2019s child chains provide a flexible approach to launching dedicated blockchains for various use cases.\n\nNotable projects, such as DFK Chain, showcase the versatility of Avalanche in the Web3 space. Over the last 30 days alone, AVAX\u2019s price soared by over 125%.\n\nWhat makes cryptocurrency grow?\n\nCryptocurrencies that have demonstrated swift growth have often done so in periods of market optimism and increased crypto adoption. Examples of this trend include certain meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which observed substantial and explosive surges during the latest crypto bull run, especially amid periods of heightened enthusiasm surrounding meme coins.\n\nBitcoin has consistently recorded notable overall growth over the years, while smart contract-capable blockchains like Ethereum and Solana experienced significant acceleration during the recent NFT craze when new smart contract use cases abounded. It\u2019s crucial to note that growth is deeply linked to the supply and demand mechanism that affects coin prices in the crypto market.\n\nWhat drives the growth of cryptocurrency?\n\nObserving the economic theory, the value of an asset is determined by the intersection of its supply and demand. When the demand outpaces the supply, the price of cryptocurrency experiences an increase.\n\nWho could dominate the crypto market in 2024?\n\nWhat the main theme of the crypto market will be in 2024 remains a mystery. According to several external analysts, Bitcoin might remain a popular subject of news and conversation in the new year. Other observers note that social fi and other trends may have a role to play in 2024\u2019s crypto arena. Meme coins and altcoins which have been popular in 2023, such as older generation meme tokens like Shiba Inu or younger meme tokens like ApeMax and Pepe coin might have their unique paths in the following year. In any case, it\u2019s too soon to say for certain what will be the trend or coin which will lead in 2024.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Fast Growing Crypto Coins\n\nThe cryptocurrency ecosystem has expanded throughout the years, with some coins experiencing unprecedented expansion sagas, defying what many skeptics thought possible as crypto moved further in the mainstream. While coins like Ethereum and Solana grew tremendously alongside meme tokens such as Shiba Inu, younger coins like ApeMax are also gaining their own fan base and experiencing momentum in their presales.\n\nAs the crypto market gears up for potential trends in 2024, its key to remember that despite past and current growth, future growth is not a guarantee, and that all cryptos are still volatile and contain risks. As readers buckle up for a new year, they can remember that the highly unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies emphasizes the need for caution, due diligence, and responsible practices.

        "title": "Ethereum as digital gold: Understanding its varied use cases - Businessday",
        "content": "In the realm of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has emerged not only as one of the pioneers in blockchain technology but also as a contender in the narrative of being \u201cdigital gold\u201d; This article aims to show Ethereum\u2019s evolving role as a store of value, akin to the traditional perception of gold, and explores the factors shaping this narrative.\n\nSmart Contracts and Inherent Value:\n\nIts primary distinction from Bitcoin lies in its ability to execute smart contracts, self-executing contracts with coded terms. While Bitcoin is often hailed as a store of value due to its scarcity, Ethereum\u2019s value proposition extends beyond scarcity to include programmability. Smart contracts add an extra layer of functionality and utility to Ethereum, potentially enhancing its intrinsic value.\n\nThe versatility provided by smart contracts enables Ethereum to be more than just a medium of exchange. It serves as a platform for decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi), further contributing to its perceived value. Investors and enthusiasts view Ethereum not only as a digital asset but as a cornerstone of a decentralized ecosystem with myriad use cases.\n\nDecentralization and Security:\n\nSimilar to gold\u2019s historical appeal as a hedge against economic uncertainties, Ethereum\u2019s decentralized nature positions it as a potential hedge in the digital realm. The lack of dependence on a single central authority and the robust security of the Ethereum blockchain contribute to its reputation as a secure and resilient store of value.\n\nDecentralization aligns with the ethos of financial sovereignty, allowing individuals to have greater control over their assets. Ethereum\u2019s commitment to maintaining a decentralized network enhances its credibility as a long-term store of value, appealing to those seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems.\n\nChallenges and Considerations:\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s narrative as digital gold gains traction, challenges persist. Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, as part of Ethereum 2.0 upgrades, aims to address scalability and environmental concerns. However, the success and timing of these upgrades play a crucial role in solidifying Ethereum\u2019s position as a store of value.\n\nMarket dynamics, regulatory developments, and competition within the cryptocurrency space are additional factors influencing Ethereum\u2019s narrative.\n\nAs the landscape evolves, Ethereum must navigate these variables to maintain and strengthen its status as a digital gold alternative.\n\nFinally, Ethereum\u2019s journey as a store of value, akin to digital gold, reflects the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. Its unique attributes, including smart contracts and decentralization, contribute to a narrative that extends beyond being a mere digital currency. As Ethereum continues to grow and adapt to emerging challenges, its role as a store of value is likely to remain a focal point in discussions surrounding the broader implications of blockchain technology and decentralized finance."
