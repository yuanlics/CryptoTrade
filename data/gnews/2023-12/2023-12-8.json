        "title": "Funding Wrap: Bitcoin, Ethereum-based projects see fresh capital - Blockworks",
        "content": "Developers working with the two largest cryptocurrencies capitalized on early bull market intrigue.\n\nRecently, there has been a notable increase in funding interest towards bitcoin mining companies. However, this week\u2019s most substantial investment influx was directed at projects developing practical applications for the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a parallel trend, various projects focused on scaling Ethereum have also secured considerable support recently. This surge in investment comes as the network gears up for its anticipated Dencun upgrade, scheduled for next year.\n\nBabylon raised $18 million in a Series A led by Polychain and Hack VC. The company focuses on a unique protocol that allows Bitcoin to be used for staking in proof-of-stake networks. It offers a secure way for bitcoin holders to earn yields without needing third-party trust or bridging to other chains.\n\nRead more: Core devs rule out Dencun fork this year\n\nElsewhere, MAP Protocol, a layer-2 chain built on Bitcoin, announced a strategic investment from Waterdrip Capital. MAP is a Bitcoin layer-2 solution that seeks to enhance cross-chain interoperability. It enables seamless interaction between Bitcoin and other public blockchain networks, ensuring secure and efficient transactions across different platforms.\n\nBitcoin investment firm Swan Bitcoin said Thursday that it raised and spent $205 million in 2023 via its equity, credit and hedge funds. The company also said it plans to raise an additional $150 million as it builds out an institutional offering.\n\nRead more: Institutional custody of bitcoin could kill it, cautions Hayes\n\nOn the Ethereum side, Paradigm led a $9 million seed round in on-chain data platform Shadow. The engineering company streamlines on-chain data access by enabling efficient retrieval from contracts and transactions, and optimizing indexing. Its approach of moving event logs to shadow forks reduces gas costs and contract sizes, offering a cost-effective solution for blockchain data management.\n\nTen announced a $7.5 million raise for its encryption-focused layer-2, while another startup named Versatus said it closed a $2.3 million seed round for its \u201cstateless\u201d Ethereum rollup.\n\nDeFi platform shunts VC backing in favor of \u2018aligned\u2019 investors\n\nLending and borrowing app Curvance closed a $3.6 million seed round this week that was noticeably thin on venture capital investment. The protocol mostly raised funds from a group of DeFi and DAO actors, including Offchain Labs and Wormhole.\n\nThe platform\u2019s co-founder Chris Carapola said Curvance capped investment in the token sale at $250,000 per party and hopes to soon turn governance over to a DAO. By capping token sale investments, Carapola suggested Curvance was trying to prevent major voting inequality within the DAO.\n\nCurvance drew interest from venture capital, Carapola said, but decided to primarily raise funds from actors in its ecosystem instead, taking over a year to do so.\n\n\u201cI would say the consistent thing that we saw was, \u2018This sounds amazing. How much can we get, and can you increase the round, can we play with the [valuation], do you want to do a Series A,\u2019 like the more conventional route. And as soon as that really became the topic, it was like, \u2018you know you\u2019re not aligned, right?\u2019\u201d Carapola said.\n\nCurvance raised its seed round at a $56 million valuation and its private round at a $75 million valuation, Carapola said.\n\nOther notable fundraises\n\nAnimoca Brands raised an $11.8 million funding tranche to develop its Mocaverse \u201cFrequent Player Program\u201d with participation from Block1, OKX Ventures, Foresight Ventures, Polygon Ventures, Dapper Labs and others.\n\nWeb3 music streaming platform Sona raised $6.9 million from Polychain Capital, Haun Ventures and Rogue Capital.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ethereum developers set roadmap for an eventful 2024 - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) developers have outlined a comprehensive plan for the network\u2019s development in 2024, including significant upgrades and new proposals after their latest execution layer meeting on Dec. 8.\n\nA key focus is on the deprecation of the Goerli testnet, with a fork scheduled for early 2024. This move is part of the strategy to activate \u2018Dencun\u2019 on the Ethereum network in January, marking a significant advancement in its technological capabilities.\n\nDencun Activation\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will introduce a novel concept in transaction processing termed \u2018blob-carrying transactions.\u2019 In this context, \u2018blobs\u2019 is an acronym for \u2018Binary Large Objects\u2019. The primary purpose of these blobs is to refine the way Ethereum stores and retrieves data by reducing the amount of data that must be stored indefinitely on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nConsequently, the transaction costs associated with data storage are expected to decrease, making overall transactions more economical. It is a critical step toward the long-term goal of danksharding, a planned scaling solution that breaks the network into smaller, parallel segments (shards) to increase capacity and efficiency.\n\nAnother notable development is the introduction of a new proposal aimed at enhancing the power of Execution Layer (EL) clients. The proposal, designed to counteract potential censorship in the mempool, would enable EL clients to override local builders using various heuristics.\n\nFor instance, clients could override when detecting transactions with excessively high fees pending for extended periods. However, adopting such heuristics has not yet been implemented broadly, with only Geth currently having an open pull request on the issue.\n\nIn terms of process updates, the development of a Meta Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) for Dencun has been a significant milestone. This is complemented by a draft for a \u201cMeta EIP backfill,\u201d which aims to provide specifications for upgrades previously lacking Meta EIPs.\n\nThe discussion around Meta EIPs has been vital in simplifying access to fork specifications, although there is an ongoing conversation about their role and naming conventions, according to ETH developer Tim Beiko.\n\nPrague/Electra upgrade\n\nLooking forward, the Ethereum community is preparing for the Prague/Electra network upgrade. Among the proposals for this upgrade is EIP-6110, which proposes a new method for supplying validator deposits on-chain, replacing the older Eth1 bridge system.\n\nFuture upgrades may also include Verkle Tries on the Execution Layer and Data Availability Sampling (DAS) on the Consensus Layer, necessitating in-depth technical reviews and discussions.\n\nThe Ethereum community is encouraged to take an active role in shaping the future of the network by participating in these technical discussions and expressing their preferences for potential features in the upcoming upgrades through forums and GitHub threads.\n\nClient teams are set to review these proposals, with more detailed discussions planned for January. This planning forms part of the broader strategic development of the Ethereum network, reflecting the continuous efforts by the developer community to evolve and refine the platform.\n\nThe Ethereum developer community remains actively engaged in enhancing the network\u2019s capabilities, with a clear roadmap set for 2024. The upcoming developments and proposals highlight the network\u2019s ongoing commitment to innovation and responsiveness to community feedback."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin All Jumped This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto winter is thawing, and some of the biggest tokens on the market have come to life in just the past week. There wasn't any major news out from the industry, but there seems to be a very big mood shift happening across crypto.\n\nAccording to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Bitcoin (BTC 1.35%) is up 13.6%, Ethereum (ETH 0.77%) has gained 12.8%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 4.20%) has popped 20.2% over the past seven days. And there doesn't seem to be any end in sight to the momentum.\n\nIs the crypto winter over?\n\nThere have been a number of catalysts for the crypto market lately. The bullish move in the stock market has been a very \"risk-on\" move which has typically translated to cryptocurrencies moving higher as well.\n\nAirdrops, or giving away tokens to wallets on the blockchain, have also added hundreds of millions of dollars in liquidity to the market, and that's pushing the values of the better-known tokens higher.\n\nCrypto can be a very sentiment-driven market, and traders are seeing a lot of reasons to be bullish right now with institutions and individuals pouring money into crypto after nearly two years of money flowing out of the industry. On top of that, interest rates are falling and growth investors are getting more bullish, which correlated with the rise in crypto in 2021.\n\nMore work ahead\n\nFor the momentum to continue, crypto needs to develop more use cases and ways to generate value than just trading. That's being done in a lot of areas including payments and decentralized financial products. But many tokens and airdrops are simply riding the hype cycle without knowing where long-term value is going to come from.\n\nI think the current state of crypto looks a lot like the fear of missing out and \"you only live once\" trading that happened during the pandemic. But this time around the market is much more well known, and bigger institutions are starting to get involved.\n\nWhat investors should be wary of is the market crashing again if the economy slows down and interest rates don't come down as fast as expected. This crypto rally isn't necessarily built on a solid footing of improving regulations and improved use cases; it's more about speculation.\n\nWhile I'm bullish on the future of the blockchain, I don't think these moves in some cryptocurrencies are sustainable. Many tokens have little use other than trading, and their long-term prospects ultimately may end in values falling and investors losing their money. There are more established tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum that have proven to be stores of value or a place where there's development, but I wouldn't take the rise in altcoins as a sustainable jump. After a great week and an even better month, it may be time to take some gains in crypto."

        "content": "Solana NFTs Eclipse Ethereum in Trading Volume Amid Surge\n\nSolana (SOL) continues to experience upward momentum, with its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) witnessing considerably higher trading volume, surpassing even that of Ethereum.\n\nProjects like Mad Lads and Tensorians have seen significant price increases, multiplying several times over in recent weeks.\n\nMoreover, the collective trading volume of Solana NFTs has now surpassed that of Ethereum, which traditionally leads in trading volume and hosts the most valuable projects.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Solana NFTs have generated $14.8 million in trades, compared to approximately $13.9 million on Ethereum, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nThis surge in Solana trading volume represents a growth of about 92% in the past day.\n\nAmong the top traded projects during this period, Tensorians, associated with the Tensor NFT marketplace, leads the way with over $4 million in sales.\n\nWithin the Solana ecosystem, Tensor currently dominates with nearly 76% market share in the past 24 hours, as reported by Tiexo.\n\nPreviously, Magic Eden, the multi-chain marketplace that held a prominent position in the Solana space, now holds about 16% market share.\n\nSOL Extends Gains as Market Rally Continues\n\n\n\nOver the past couple of days, Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency SOL has posted significant gains and its leading meme coin BONK reached new all-time highs.\n\nOn Friday, SOL reached a new 19-month peak, touching $73.85.\n\nAlthough still a far cry from its all-time high of nearly $260 in November 2021, SOL has made a remarkable recovery from its low of around $8 in late 2022.\n\nCurrently trading above $73, SOL has recorded a 13% surge in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBONK, the leading meme coin on the Solana network, has been on a rapid ascent in recent weeks, setting a new all-time high price of $0.00001314 on Friday.\n\nEven with a slight dip to $0.00001283 at the time of writing, BONK has registered a 10% gain in the past 24 hours and tripled in value over the last seven days.\n\nIn the past month alone, BONK has skyrocketed by an astounding 982%, propelling it into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with a total market cap of $747 million.\n\nIn addition to the remarkable price performance, the recipients of the Jito airdrop on the Solana DeFi platform are also reaping substantial benefits.\n\nThe JTO token distributed to early users during the airdrop has surged by 72% in the past day, reaching $3.35 per token.\n\nLast week, Jupiter, a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator running on the Solana blockchain, also announced the opening of initial claims for its JUP token airdrop.\n\nThe airdrop has been designed to distribute 40% of the total JUP token supply, which amounts to four out of the 10 billion tokens."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum is showing signs of a potential new era of growth amid a market that is increasingly favoring Layer-1 (L1) solutions like Solana. Ethereum's price movement has not yet shown the explosiveness the majority of the market had been expecting. However, the cryptocurrency might still show us what it's got.\n\nThe price trajectory of Ethereum has been robust, with recent trends suggesting that the momentum behind its surge is far from over. Despite lagging behind some of its L1 counterparts, Ethereum holds a unique position on the market due to its extensive developer community, widespread adoption and the significant role it plays in decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain applications.\n\nWhile Ethereum has not experienced the same intensity in its price surge as Solana, the potential for profit on the ongoing bull market remains substantial. Ethereum continues to be an attractive investment due to its size, liquidity and status as the leading platform for smart contracts. This suggests that any further gains on the broader market could amplify ETH's price performance.\n\nTechnical analysis reveals that Ethereum is poised for growth, with key resistance levels being tested. A breakthrough above these levels could signal a continuation of the bull run, enticing both retail and institutional investors.\n\nSolana is king\n\nSolana (SOL) has been a standout on the cryptocurrency market, displaying a price momentum that far exceeds expectations, especially in the wake of the Jito airdrop. The drop injected fresh funds into the SOL ecosystem, boosting its already impressive performance.\n\nThe price movement analysis of Solana reveals a steep upward trajectory, signifying not just a recovery, but dominance in the digital asset space. The resilience and rapid growth of SOL are indicative of a robust and well-engaged network. The asset's performance is not only impressive when viewed in isolation but also when compared to other cryptocurrencies, whose surges have been less intense.\n\nThe potential for Solana to breach the symbolic $100 mark, a level not seen since its collapse in 2021, has been a topic of speculation among market watchers. Prominent figures in the cryptocurrency game, such as Arthur Hayes, have expressed belief in Solana's ability to reach this milestone. With the current price action, Solana is not just fulfilling these predictions; it is surpassing them, setting new highs and establishing a strong presence on the market.\n\nSolana's ascent is particularly noteworthy given the broader context of the market. While other assets struggle to maintain momentum, SOL's surge is a testament to its underlying technology and the confidence it instills in investors. The blockchain's high throughput and low transaction fees position it as a strong competitor in the space, capable of sustaining growth even in a turbulent market.\n\nBitcoin remains neutral\n\nBitcoin's recent price reversal could be construed as a beacon of positivity for the altcoin markets. After a period of consolidation and bearish trends, Bitcoin's turnaround has begun to inject optimism into the crypto ecosystem. This shift in momentum often has a ripple effect on altcoins, which can experience amplified movements in response to Bitcoin's falling dominance.\n\nIts dominant position means that positive price action can lead to increased investor confidence, which often spills over to the altcoin markets. When Bitcoin's price stabilizes or starts to climb, it can provide the necessary reassurance for investors to start diversifying their portfolios with altcoins, hence, driving up their prices.\n\nBitcoin's reversal comes at a pivotal moment when many altcoins have been developing their ecosystems and strengthening their use cases. With the leading cryptocurrency regaining ground, it could be the catalyst that altcoins need to attract more attention and investment. A bullish Bitcoin could mean more capital flowing into the crypto market as a whole, and altcoins are well-positioned to benefit from this influx.\n\nFurthermore, when Bitcoin surges, it can lead to a reallocation of profits from Bitcoin to altcoins as investors seek to maximize returns by investing in assets with higher potential upside. This can be particularly beneficial for well-established altcoins with solid fundamentals and for emerging coins that capture the market's imagination."

        "content": "Ethereum developers agreed to set a Goerli fork date to activate Dencun in January 2024, if things keep going as planned.\n\nThe All Core Developers Execution Call (ACDE), a bi-weekly meeting where developers coordinate changes to the Execution Layer of the Ethereum blockchain, concluded on Thursday with an update on the activation date for the Dencun upgrade.\n\nThe developers agreed that, if all goes well, they will set a Goerli fork date to activate Dencun on the testnet in January 2024.\n\nGoerli is Ethereum\u2019s first multi-client testnet, which went live ahead of The Merge in two phases last year. In the coming months, Goerli will stop being supported by Ethereum client and Ethereum Foundation testing teams, making Dencun the last-ever upgrade that will be implemented on the network.\n\nTim Beiko, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s protocol support lead, recommended coordinating a hard fork as soon as developers return from the holiday break, assuming no major bugs are discovered in clients on Devnet 12.\n\n\u201cTeams seem generally ready to move towards forking testnets! We have a big Goerli shadow fork planned in the next couple weeks, and, assuming this doesn\u2019t find issues, then forking Goerli itself would provide the most testing value,\u201d he noted.\n\nBeiko has also created a Meta EIP document ahead of Dencun that lists all the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) included in the upgrade.\n\nPrevious forks have their specs nested in two different places of two different repos, and combined EL/CL upgrades didn't have a single, canonical list of EIPs. Having Meta EIPs makes all of this much easier to understand. That said, no objections to changing the category name! \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) December 7, 2023\n\nThe final item on the agenda was planning for the Prague/Electra network upgrade, where certain code updates will require changes on both the Execution Layer and Client Layer, and as such the Prague and Electra upgrades will need to be coordinated at the same time.\n\nDevelopers have already started proposing the upgrades that they would like to include in a thread on EthMagicians."

        "content": "Ethereum new addresses stay within the 90,000 range.\n\nThe number of new depositors remains low.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] price has experienced a positive trend lately, and one might have anticipated a surge in new users eager to join the excitement. Despite a steady influx of new users, there is no apparent sense of urgency or rush.\n\nMixed signals from Ethereum\u2019s new addresses\n\nA recent post from IntoTheBlock showed that Ethereum has yet to see a surge in new addresses despite the prevailing bullish market conditions.\n\nHowever, an examination of the new address metric on Glassnode showed some noteworthy trends. The chart indicated a consistent trend, aligning with the overall pattern observed throughout the year. This is despite that there has not been a recent spike.\n\nFurthermore, the analysis showed that, as of this writing, the number of new addresses was over the figures recorded at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe chart displayed intermittent spikes, yet the count of new addresses consistently was around the 90,000 mark. At the time of writing, the number of new addresses was 91,547, with a notable spike observed.\n\nEthereum new stakes declines\n\nEthereum has recently encountered a setback, particularly in the number of new depositors. According to CryptoQuant data, there has been a significant decline in the number of new depositors or stakers.\n\nThe chart indicates that, at the time of this report, the count of new depositors was around 1,300. At the beginning of the month, this number was nearly twice as high and had even surged to over 5,000 at one point.\n\nWhile not the lowest recorded daily depositor count, it signifies a notable decrease in staking activities over the past few months.\n\nETH sustains its upward trend\n\nEthereum has recently demonstrated a strong price performance, with its daily timeframe chart revealing a significant uptrend. This positive momentum has propelled its value into the $2,300 range, a level not seen in a while.\n\nAs of this writing, it was trading at around $2,370, with an increase of less than 1%. The chart showed that it was trading above both its short- and long-moving averages (yellow and blue lines), respectively.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nWhile the current trend is bullish, the surge in price has yet to be accompanied by a proportional increase in the number of new addresses.\n\nThis suggests that retail traders may be exercising caution. It appears that they are hesitating to enter the market, possibly observing from the sidelines to assess whether the current trend is sustainable or a speculative bubble."

        "content": "The co-founders of the crypto analytics firm Glassnode believe that altcoins are about to go on a rally as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) soar.\n\nGlassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who share the Negentropic handle on the social media platform X, say that the total altcoin market cap is already rising, indicating bullishness for alts.\n\n\u201cHow much longer will altcoins trail behind before making their move? The Bitcoin narrative continues to steer the ship, but a closer look reveals the total altcoin market cap playing catch-up. With Ethereum and BTC leading the way, we are potentially on the brink of an altcoin surge.\u201d\n\nThe founders also predict increased volatility for Bitcoin\u2019s price but a rally continuation. They say that the crypto king could dip to the $40,000 level while remaining in an overall uptrend.\n\n\u201cBTC\u2019s bullish momentum: navigating the uncharted journey to $46,000.\n\nDespite the four-hour timeframe indicating BTC is overbought BTC\u2019s upward trend may persist, intensifying investor FOMO (fear of missing out) across the board.\n\nTechnically, BTC navigates uncharted territory towards $46,000. Expect volatile moves between $40,000-$46,000. The 20-day EMA (exponential moving average) provides a safety net for potential pullbacks, making shorting risky. Current patterns hint at a climb towards $45,000.\n\nConclusion: stay alert, but optimistic. Yet the BTC\u2019s momentum suggests more upside.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $43,424 at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe two also use the Elliott Wave theory to suggest that the total market cap for cryptocurrencies could soar to an all-time high (ATH) of $4.4 trillion during the current bull cycle, surpassing the previous ATH of about $3 trillion.\n\nThe Elliott Wave theory attempts to forecast price movements based on crowd psychology which tends to manifest in waves. Traditionally, the Elliott Wave theory suggests that price impulses happen in five waves after three-wave \u201cABC\u201d corrections.\n\n\u201cThird time a charm? When crypto starts its move, it goes vertical by the end of the move! The journey has just begun. And RSI (relative strength index) is in the \u2018extremely bullish\u2019 zone. Are you strapped up for this move? Extreme euphoria may likely be seen by the end of the rally.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, the total crypto market cap stands at $1.69 trillion.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum has powered back from recent bearish sentiment with a vengeance, displaying formidable strength as it approaches pivotal resistance levels. This steep rebound combined with extremely bullish on-chain activity signals Ethereum may be on the cusp of a major breakout rally over the next year.\n\nKeypoints\n\nEthereum price has rebounded strongly and is heading towards a key resistance level\n\nToken shows extreme strength which points to a positive long-term outlook, potentially reaching a new all-time high soon\n\nNon-exchange Ethereum addresses have hit an all-time high of 54.6 million compared to 150 biggest exchange addresses at 5-year low of 9.3 million\n\nThis suggests retail traders are accumulating and whales are losing sell-off power\n\nAnalyst Michael van de Poppe predicts Ethereum could hit $3,000 in Q1 2024\n\nAfter a crushing crypto market downturn for most of 2022, Ethereum has been one of the standout performers in December. Its price has soared around 40% in a month, bouncing firmly off support despite broader asset market volatility. This resilience is underpinned by growing data that retail traders are fervently accumulating ETH while whales lose their sell-off capabilities.\n\nBlockchain analytics firm Santiment reports non-exchange addresses holding Ethereum have exploded to an all-time high of 54.6 million. At the same time, balances of ETH on centralized exchanges have plummeted to a 5-year low. This suggests everyday traders are stockpiling Ethereum in anticipation of higher prices while the largest wallet holders see their influence wane.\n\n???? #Ethereum has scratched its way to $2,349, its highest level since June, 2022. The long-term trend of top non-exchange whale wallets getting richer, and top exchange whale wallets having less sell-off power, is a promising combo for a continued climb. https://t.co/h7ogbqPLWf pic.twitter.com/82plXmVn02 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 7, 2023\n\nThe technical chart also looks promising for Ethereum as it presses against formidable resistance around the $1,800 level. Well-followed analyst Michael van de Poppe expects this wall to crumble in early 2024, tweeting that Ethereum reaching $3,000 is a realistic possibility in Q1 next year if bullish momentum persists.\n\n#Ethereum starts to rally against $BTC. In the period prior to the #Bitcoin halving, 3-8 months before, it's the best period to allocate towards altcoins. Right now, we might be seeing the exact same on $ETH, which means that Ethereum is ready for $3,000+ in Q1. pic.twitter.com/9HPzTeIK6A \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 7, 2023\n\nOther experts highlight Ethereum\u2019s history of slow, steady growth eventually resulting in parabolic upside moves as justification for a pending supply shock. And positive sentiment continues swelling around ETH in comparison to the turmoil embroiling major centralized crypto institutions in 2022.\n\nOf course, nothing is guaranteed in the volatile world of cryptocurrency markets. However, Ethereum possesses fundamental advantages as the leading smart contract platform and clear technical and on-chain signals hinting at substantial upside. The stars may be aligning for Ethereum to power higher through 2023 into a fresh all-time high by early next year."

        "title": "What Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) in Cryptocurrency, and How Does It Work? - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Shiba Inu (SHIB)?\n\nShiba Inu is an Ethereum-based altcoin (a cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin) that features the Shiba Inu\u2014a Japanese breed of hunting dog\u2014as its mascot. Shiba Inu is widely considered to be an alternative to Dogecoin; in fact, proponents of Shiba Inu tout it as \"the Dogecoin killer.\"\n\nShiba Inu and Dogecoin are meme coins, which are cryptocurrencies associated with some theme\u2014like the Shiba Inu in the case of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin\u2014but are often launched as a parody or inside joke rather than as a digital product that actually has utility. While Dogecoin was launched in December 2013, Shiba Inu was created in August 2020 by an anonymous individual or group called Ryoshi.\n\nKey Takeaways Shiba Inu is an Ethereum-based altcoin that features the Shiba Inu hunting dog as its mascot.\n\nIt is widely considered an alternative to Dogecoin and is touted as \"the Dogecoin killer\" by its supporters, a community calling itself the SHIBArmy.\n\nShiba Inu was created in August 2020 by an individual or group called Ryoshi.\n\nShiba Inu's price peaked more than tenfold on Oct. 29, 2021, giving it a market capitalization of $41 billion at the time. Even with a steep drop in market cap to $5.97 billion (as of Dec. 8, 2023), Shiba Inu still ranks in the top ten among all meme cryptocurrencies by this measure, second to Dogecoin.\n\nThe History of Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nThe guiding tenets of the Shiba Inu ecosystem are spelled out in a \"woof paper\" (presumably a play on the term \"white paper\"), available at the ShibaToken.com website.\n\nAccording to the paper, Shiba Inu was developed to answer a simple question: \"What would happen if a cryptocurrency project was 100% run by its community?\" Its founder, Ryoshi, attributes its origins to an \"experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building.\" According to Ryoshi, the power of collective decentralization can build something stronger than a centralized team ever could create.\n\nThe SHIBArmy's base of nearly 500,000 Reddit members embraces its founding principles, which are:\n\nThe project started from zero, with zero, in the spirit of creating something out of nothing\n\nIt was not founded from an existing community or preassembled team\n\nA professed love of Shiba Inu dogs\n\nBecause Shiba Inu is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token, it was created on and hosted by the Ethereum blockchain instead of its own blockchain. Ryoshi states in the paper that he chose to build the Shiba Inu ecosystem on Ethereum because it was already secure and well-established, and it allowed the project to stay decentralized.\n\nBlockchain Updates\n\nIn January 2023, the Shiba Inu community leadership introduced Shibarium, a layer two blockchain designed to run on top of Ethereum. It is supposed to reduce congestion, introduce staking into its ecosystem, lower gas fees, and provide a framework for decentralized applications and Web 3 expansion.\n\nThe Shiba Inu Ecosystem\n\nThe Shiba Inu ecosystem consists of the following three tokens, with one to be added \"soon\" (as of Dec. 8, 2023):\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) : This is the project's foundational currency. Starting with a supply of about 1 quadrillion (equal to 1,000 trillion), Ryoshi locked 50% in Uniswap (for liquidity purposes) and then sent the other 50% to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin for safekeeping. In May 2021, Buterin donated more than 50 trillion Shiba Inu coins worth over $1 billion to a COVID-19 relief fund in India when the nation was reeling from the Delta variant of the coronavirus. Shortly thereafter, Buterin also \"burned\"\u2014or permanently removed from circulation\u201440% of Shiba Inu's total supply by moving it to a \"dead wallet.\"\n\n: This is the project's foundational currency.

Shortly thereafter, Buterin also \"burned\"\u2014or permanently removed from circulation\u201440% of Shiba Inu's total supply by moving it to a \"dead wallet.\" Leash (LEASH) : The second token in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Leash represents the other end of the ecosystem's spectrum, with a total supply of only 107,646 tokens compared with the trillions of Shiba Inu tokens. Leash is used for rewarding ecosystem supporters with perks.\n\n: The second token in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Leash represents the other end of the ecosystem's spectrum, with a total supply of only 107,646 tokens compared with the trillions of Shiba Inu tokens. Leash is used for rewarding ecosystem supporters with perks. Bone (BONE) : Bone fits in between the other two tokens in terms of circulation supply, with a total supply of 250,000,000 tokens. Originally designed to be a governance token, it is going to be used in Shibarium to reward validators, who bury (stake) their Bones, and delegators, who give their voting rights to validators.\n\n: Bone fits in between the other two tokens in terms of circulation supply, with a total supply of 250,000,000 tokens.

Treat (TREAT): Unknown purpose as of Dec. 8, 2023.\n\nThere are other Shiba Inu-related platforms and ideas that interact with the ecosystem:\n\nShibaSwap : The goal of DeFi platform ShibaSwap is to provide a safe place to trade cryptocurrencies while remaining decentralized. SHIB and LEASH are best purchased and sold through ShibaSwap.\n\n: The goal of DeFi platform ShibaSwap is to provide a safe place to trade cryptocurrencies while remaining decentralized.

Shiba Inu Incubator : The incubator aims to shift the focus beyond popular art forms such as painting, photography, and digital rendering and discover ways to honor creativity and ingenuity.\n\n: The incubator aims to shift the focus beyond popular art forms such as painting, photography, and digital rendering and discover ways to honor creativity and ingenuity. Shiboshis: Shiboshis are 10,000 Shiba Inu-generated non-fungible tokens (NFTs) written on the Ethereum blockchain, with different traits that make each Shiboshi unique and collectible.\n\nSHIB's Canine Terminology\n\nIn keeping with the dog theme, the aforementioned Shiba Inu woof paper uses canine terms to describe how returns can be generated from one's Shiba Inu tokens. On ShibaSwap, these tokens can be used to \"dig\" (provide liquidity), \"bury\" (stake tokens), and even \"fetch\" (exchange one token for another). Tokens used in these strategies generate \"Woof\" returns in the form of Bone tokens that are distributed to token pools known as \"Puppy Pools,\" according to the woof paper.\n\nFor cryptocurrency enthusiasts, part of the allure of meme coins is that they reject conventional protocols, and this unconventional approach may extend to the use of canine terms to describe return strategies. But they certainly seem to be a world away from staid investment terms such as return on investment and liquidity.\n\nHow to Get SHIB\n\nYou can purchase SHIB on several exchanges using their wallets, such as Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Kraken, to name a few. You can also set up a MetaMask wallet and connect it to Shiba Swap, the exchange recommended (and created) by the Shiba Inu community.\n\nConcerns About Shiba Inu\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies is risky enough because of their massive volatility and lack of regulation. Investing in the altcoin/meme coin space presents an additional challenge because of a lack of differentiation and the fact that most of their value is based on trading by their followers. Here are some investing considerations for a potential investor in Shiba Inu.\n\nLow Per-Token Price\n\nEven after some impressive gains, Shiba Inu (SHIB) costs a fraction of a cent, so one can buy millions of SHIB tokens with a few hundred dollars. At its peak price of $0.00008845, $100 would have fetched over 1.1 million SHIB tokens. The amount of coins you can purchase can cause significant losses if SHIB's price ever tumbles, but the chance of tremendous gains also exists.\n\nLimited Utility and Use Case\n\nThough its adherents may point out that Shiba Inu-based NFTs are now available, and its Ethereum base and new Layer 2 blockchain should increase transaction speeds and scalability, as of Dec. 7, 2023, Shiba Inu has very limited utility and does not have a compelling use case as of the end of 2023 other than allowing non-fungible tokens.\n\nVolatility\n\nShibu Inu's price experiences wide fluctuations, but the cryptocurrency is much less expensive than others on the market, so they are actually quite small. For example, from Jan. 1, 2023, to Dec. 7, 2023, SHIBs highest and lowest prices had a difference of $0.0000099.\n\nThis appears very low, but losses multiply with the amount purchased or held\u2014bsince you can buy a tremendous amount of SHIB, at scale, losses could be huge. If you had purchased 10 million SHIB at its 2023 high ($0.00001562496), you would have paid $156.25. On Dec. 8, 2023, you'd still have been waiting for gains, as SHIB's price was $0.00001006 at one point, a value of $100.60 for your 10 million SHIB. Imagine if you had purchased a one billion SHIB ($15,624.96 at the highest price) hoping for gains. Your SHIB would have been worth $10,060.00 on Dec. 8, 2023\u2014a loss of $5,564.96.\n\nSome trades have become the stuff of investing legend, such as George Soros' wager against the British pound in 1991 or the short subprime mortgages trade by John Paulson from 2007 to 2009. In terms of sheer percentage gains, a purported trade in Shiba Inu by an unknown trader puts even those legendary trades in the shade. The trader bought about 70 trillion SHIB tokens for approximately $8,000 in August 2020. One year later, that stake accounted for about 13% of SHIB's total circulation of 550 trillion and gained a staggering value of $5.7 billion.\n\nHow Much Is 1 Shiba Coin Worth? One SHIB was worth about $0.000010017 on Dec. 8, 2023. As of that date, the coin had never reached a value of more than $0.00008845.\n\nIs Shiba Inu a Good Investment? Whether or not SHIB is a good investment depends on your investing goals, risk tolerance, strategy, personal preferences, and outlook.\n\nWhich Crypto Will Boom In 2024? It is difficult to tell which cryptocurrency, if any, will experience a boom. The space constantly undergoes changes and reacts, almost explosively, to the news.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nShiba Inu is a cryptocurrency which, at its creation in 2021, had no use or value. By the end of 2023, it was being traded in large volumes to take advantage of microscopic price movements and used as a payment method. Shiba Inu is continuously being developed and improved by a dedicated community to have utility and use cases, so there is a distinct possibility that it will remain one of the more popular cryptocurrencies on the market.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nCryptocurrency expert Evan Aldo recently talked about different digital currencies, giving us the lowdown on their current situations and where they might be headed. On The Paul Barron Network, the analyst said that further price movement could be influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s performance, suggesting that a Bitcoin surge to $48,000 or $50,000 could propel the altcoins to perform better.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nAldo talked about Ethereum, mentioning that even though its price in regular money (USD) went up, when compared to Bitcoin, it\u2019s not doing so great. He said that if Ethereum doesn\u2019t hold on to a certain level, it might drop even lower, possibly to around $2200. But, Aldo stays hopeful about Ethereum\u2019s future, thinking it might bounce back and reach a target just under $2400.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nThe analyst had good things to say about Avalanche, saying it has been doing well recently. He mentioned that if Avalanche can go above $30, it might shoot up to around $39. Aldo believes Avalanche has a good chance of hitting its all-time high within the next two years.\n\nChainlink (LINK)\n\nTalking about Chainlink, Aldo said that while it has gained a lot in the past, there could be better options out there. He thinks Chainlink still has potential, and if it breaks some important levels, it might reach around $20. Aldo pointed out positive signs, like good money flow in the 3-day chart and a possible change in trend on the monthly chart.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nAldo touched briefly on Solana, noting that it recently announced a $20 nationwide cell phone plan. While he recognized Solana\u2019s success, he also warned about potential sell-offs after big announcements and recommended keeping a close eye on key technical indicators. He discussed the potential price prediction for Solana, indicating a target between $75 and $80. Aldo pointed out positive technical indicators, such as trigger waves on the 6-hour chart and a potential breakout if Solana can maintain support at $62."

        "title": "2 Reasons Why An Ethereum Mega Bull Run Is Inevitable - NewsBTC",
        "content": "While the recent Bitcoin and crypto momentum is cooling off, Ethereum (ETH) rejects lower lows, especially against Bitcoin (BTC). Taking to X on December 8, decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher DefiIgnas shared insights that suggest ETH could be on the verge of a rally that would potentially see the second most valuable coin usurp BTC\u2019s current position as the best-performing asset.\n\nReasons That Might Drive Ethereum Bulls\n\nThe researcher observed that ETH is down 24% versus BTC in 2023. However, multiple fundamental indicators show that this is about to change. First, DefiIgnas noted that crypto investors are increasingly drawn to discounted Grayscale Ethereum Trust (GETH), which has been rallying over the past few months, outperforming Ethereum spot prices.\n\nGETH surged by 298% in the past few months, while ETH only rose by around 100% in the same period. As GETH share prices increased, its discount with spot ETH decreased. This means more capital indirectly flowed into ETH, leading to higher demand.\n\nBesides GETH rising, the researcher remains bullish on Ethereum because of the recent developments surrounding the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF. The crypto community expects the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to authorize multiple products, including those proposed by Fidelity and BlackRock.\n\nIn DefiIgnas\u2019 assessment, once the spot Bitcoin ETF goes live, likely in early 2024, all \u201cattention, narrative, and speculation\u201d will shift toward the agency approving the first spot Ethereum ETF. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has already applied with the SEC to issue the first spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe expected activation of the Cancun upgrade in H1 2024 will also likely support Ethereum prices. Over the years, Ethereum has integrated multiple upgrades. This includes shifting to proof-of-stake (PoS) from proof-of-work (PoW) and overhauling their fee auction mechanism, introducing ETH burning.\n\nHowever, with Cancun, the goal is to directly enhance the main net\u2019s capabilities by activating several proposals, including EIP-4844 proto-dank sharding, which aims to reduce gas fees associated with rollups. This update will further cement Ethereum\u2019s quest to significantly increase on-chain scalability and reduce gas fees over the years.\n\nETH Looks Firm, Resistance At November Highs\n\nAt spot rates, ETH is firm versus BTC, looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. How prices react in the days ahead remains to be seen.\n\nEven so, if there is confirmation of the December 7 gains, ETH might extend gains. In that case, it can break above the current consolidation as bulls aim to break above November 2023 highs of around 0.058 BTC.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

When paired against Bitcoin, Ethereum is trading at 0.05462 BTC at time of writing, down by around 23% year to date.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin, Bluntz says that the flagship crypto asset will likely extend the rally that kicked off at around the $36,000 level. According to the analyst, Bitcoin looks poised for another move up while other traders are waiting for a deep corrective move.\n\n\u201cAll I see is people taking profit and warning of impending 10-15% pullbacks.\n\nYou all are not ready for how far this leg from $36,000 extends.\u201d\n\nBluntz is a popular practitioner of the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis method that attempts to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave rally with each wave having its own five sub-waves.\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he seems to predict that Bitcoin will rise to as high as $53,000 before ending the five-wave surge.\n\nBitcoin is trading at $43,435 at time of writing.\n\nNext up is the layer-1 smart contract blockchain Sui (SUI). According to Bluntz, Sui is gearing up to break out of its accumulation phase.\n\n\u201cSUI is another new coin that looks ready for the markup phase.\n\nHad an 80% decline after initial listing pump and now some very nice accumulation.\u201d\n\nSui is trading at $0.681 at time of writing, slightly above Bluntz\u2019s accumulation range.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A new report by investment firm VanEck lays out 15 projections for the cryptocurrency landscape 2024. The report dives into the key possibility of whether Ethereum can dethrone Bitcoin.\n\nContradictory to the notion, the report mentioned that Ethereum will fall short of \u201cflipping\u201d Bitcoin next year despite robust gains.\n\nThe analysis sees Bitcoin retaining its position as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Bitcoin may also attract state-level support from countries like Argentina. The report also points to Bitcoin\u2019s clear regulatory status and higher energy consumption. This is forecast to attract interest from quasi-state entities in regions such as Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin From \u201cSatoshi Era\u201d on the Move: Here\u2019s Where It\u2019s Headed\n\nAs the fifth country to sponsor Bitcoin mining at the state level, Argentina, through its state-owned energy giant YPF, is signaling interest in mining digital assets.\n\nEthereum outlook is still strong\n\nDespite the outlook, Ethereum is expected to outrun mega-cap tech stocks massively. VanEck believes Ethereum will surge post-halving when Bitcoin miners\u2019 rewards are cut in half. This historically triggers a renewed Bitcoin price surge, with profits flowing into altcoins afterward.\n\nHowever, despite beating major stocks, Ethereum won\u2019t overtake Bitcoin, as speculation of \u201cflippening\u201d suggests. While some likelihood of ETH becoming more valuable in daily trade volume exists, Bitcoin is still seen as maintaining its market cap lead.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu To 1 Cent?

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Fees Rise By Over 50%: Will BTC Conquer $69k? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "There is a spike in crypto on-chain activity if transaction fees lead. According to IntoTheBlock data on December 8, Bitcoin transaction fees are up by over 60%, while \u201cgas\u201d in Ethereum has climbed by nearly 50% in the past week.\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum Transaction Fees Rise By Double-Digits\n\nThis surge in activity can be pinned to multiple factors, mainly growing user interest and the ongoing crypto bull market. To illustrate, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are trending at 2023 highs above $43,500 and $2,300 when writing.\n\nEven so, the crypto community expects these coins to extend gains in the coming weeks and months, partly because of expected institutional capital, projected to be in their billions, flowing to the sphere.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock data, cumulative fees collected in Bitcoin this week stand at $43.8 million, up 61%. On the other hand, $83.3 million in fees has been accrued from Ethereum.\n\nLooking at the historical transaction fees trend, transacting on Ethereum, despite its relatively high transaction processing speeds (TPS), is more expensive than Bitcoin. This can be due to Ethereum\u2019s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible token (NFT) minting, and more. Bitcoin is a transactional layer and doesn\u2019t inherently support smart contracts.\n\nUsually, rising on-chain transaction fees are bullish for price and indicate that their respective ecosystem is thriving from increasing adoption. With transaction fees rising in the two leading blockchain ecosystems, more people want to interact with the project. Subsequently, this could support prices since BTC or ETH is used for paying transaction fees.\n\nWill BTC Ease Past 2021 Highs Of $70,000?\n\nAs BTC is currently trading above $43,500 and ETH recently broke above $2,300, the possibility of these coins retesting and easing past their all-time highs of $70,000 and $4,800, respectively, cannot be discounted. One of the key drivers of the surge in on-chain activity is the ongoing bull market.\n\nWith crypto rising, more people are looking to position themselves, hoping to profit from further price appreciation. This wave of fear of missing out (FOMO) has pushed higher fees and prices.\n\nThe demand for liquid and SEC-recognized digital assets will likely increase once the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) goes ahead and authorizes the first Bitcoin ETF. This derivative product will allow institutions to invest in Bitcoin confidently through a regulated solution.\n\nAs the odds of the SEC approving this product rose from early Q4 2023, BTC and ETH prices started rising in sync. Still, how prices will react once the spot Bitcoin ETF is approved remains to be seen. Once the SEC green-lights a spot Bitcoin ETF, the crypto market will begin looking at Ethereum and whether the agency will approve a similar solution.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Meanwhile, two projects are capturing the attention of whales \u2013 Arbitrum (ARB) and InQubeta (QUBE).\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the details of these developments shaping the crypto landscape.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF dilemma: a call for public participation\n\nFidelity, an asset management firm, filed for approval of its Ethereum Fund on Nov. 17, joining a growing list of firms vying for a spot in the competitive world of crypto ETFs in the U.S.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s call for public input is crucial in the regulatory process. It allows stakeholders and seasoned and beginner cryptocurrency enthusiasts to voice their opinions on the potential listing and trading of shares from Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Fund on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum can surge to $3,100; InQubeta on bullish path\n\nThe filing emphasizes that the absence of a spot Ethereum ETF in the U.S. exposes investors to significant risks, pushing them towards potentially riskier alternatives. With the SEC having yet to greenlight any spot cryptocurrency investment vehicles, the public has 21 days to submit comments following the filing\u2019s publication in the Federal Register.\n\nThe decision on Fidelity\u2019s proposal could mark a pivotal moment in the journey toward mainstream crypto adoption, and propel Ethereum to new heights.\n\nArbitrum: riding the waves of change\n\nShifting gears from regulatory matters, let\u2019s dive into the world of Arbitrum, where recent developments have kept enthusiasts on the edge of their seats. Considered one of the top altcoins to watch, it has managed to defy expectations, showcasing stability in its price despite the volatility that often accompanies such proposals.\n\nArbitrum DAO\u2019s recent approval of a hard fork, marked by overwhelming community support with over 99% of the votes, has positioned the network for significant improvements. The proposed hard fork, including upgrades like EVM Shanghai and the PUSH0 opcode, aims to enhance the chain\u2019s infrastructure and network fees.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin\u2019s market triumph: InQubeta and Injective poised for gains\n\nDespite occasional dips, Arbitrum\u2019s ARB has maintained a steady presence above the $1.00 mark. Recent price movements, with fluctuations recovering promptly, suggest an upward trajectory. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators flash bullish signals, signaling a potential surge beyond $1.10. This performance has attracted significant attention from whales, which may further bolster ARB prices.\n\nInQubeta: democratizing AI investments\n\nIn a world where investing in cutting-edge AI startups can be elusive for the average person, InQubeta (QUBE) aims to break barriers.\n\nInQubeta is democratizing AI investments. Utilizing NFTs allows investors with varying budgets to own a stake in the AI startup landscape, creating a bridge between high-tech innovation and accessible investment opportunities.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin targets $40k, GMX and InQubeta bullish\n\nIn stage 6 of its 10-stage presale, InQubeta (QUBE) has raised over $6.3 million by selling over 608 million tokens.

Traders are at liberty to continue betting on ETH longs, provided the blue MACD line holds above the red signal line.\n\nSimilarly, the momentum indicator should generally be moving higher above the neutral area, to reinforce the prevailing bullish thesis.\n\nAlthough several factors may influence Ethereum price in December, including the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) narrative, declines are likely to be minimal as the sell-side pressure weakens.\n\nFor now, it would be prudent for traders to watch out for two key levels; if the resistance at $2,400 gives in and support at $2,300 holds. The first scenario could spread FOMO across the market, with more holders buying in speculation for the next move to $3,000 and then to $3,550.\n\nIn the second scenario, Ethereum could retest support at $2,300 and springboard strongly with a comeback strong enough to blast through $2,400. However, the technical structure could change if a stronger correction pushes Ethereum price to retest $2,100 before making another recovery attempt.\n\nEthereum price is slightly overbought according to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the daily time frame. If bulls don\u2019t present a stronger case, bears could overrule their reign for a correction to $2,100 and $2,000, respectively.\n\nRecommended for you: Cardano Price As Pump Setup Triggers, Is ADA Going To $1 In December?\n\nEthereum Open Interest Soars To $8B\n\nThe open interest (OI), which monitors the flow of money in and out of a futures or options market, has been growing consistently since June 2022, according to Coinglass data.\n\nAs IO increases it suggests that new money is coming into the derivatives market than the money flowing out. Moreover, Ethereum price rising along with the OI, confirms a long-term bullish outlook.\n\nThe Ethereum open interest currently slightly below $8 billion is back at pre-Terra crash levels in 2022 and suggests the market is slowly easing into the bull run following a lengthy bear run.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nEthereum experienced significant growth in 2023, with a year-to-date high of approximately $2,385, marking a 97% rise in value.\n\nThis surge, however, presents a dichotomy when viewed through the prism of Bitcoin. Using Bitcoin as a reference point, Ethereum saw a decline of 25%, positioning it only 6% higher than the year-to-date lows.\n\nThe Bitcoin-Ethereum ratio stands at 0.0544, indicating an exchange rate of roughly 18 Ethereum per Bitcoin. This figure contrasts starkly with the cycle\u2019s low in September 2022, when the ratio was 12 Ethereum for 1 Bitcoin.\n\nThe data highlights Ethereum\u2019s impressive performance when measured in USD while hinting at a less favorable trend when compared to Bitcoin. Evaluating all assets, including Ethereum, could redefine what constitutes a \u2018good year\u2019 for cryptocurrency investments if Bitcoin were to ascend to a global currency status."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has surged to a new yearly high.\n\nThe price rally comes amid a growing trend of whale accumulation.\n\nAnalysts anticipate that the price is likely to go higher.\n\nAs Bitcoin, the largest crypto asset by market cap, appears to be slowing its roll, investors have turned their attention to a basket of altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH). The asset has claimed a fresh high for 2023 amid the renewed interest.\n\nETH Claims 19-Month High\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Ethereum has climbed above the $2,350 price level for the first time since May 2022, marking a fresh 2023 high and its highest price level in 19 months. At the time of writing, the asset\u2019s price continues to climb, trading at $2,363.51, representing a 5.55% gain in the past 24 hours per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nIn an X post on Thursday, December 7, crypto analytics firm Santiment Feed implied that the recent spike in ETH\u2019s price would continue amid increased accumulation by non-exchange whales.\n\n\ud83d\udc33 #Ethereum has scratched its way to $2,349, its highest level since June, 2022. The long-term trend of top non-exchange whale wallets getting richer, and top exchange whale wallets having less sell-off power, is a promising combo for a continued climb. https://t.co/h7ogbqPLWf pic.twitter.com/82plXmVn02 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 7, 2023\n\nThe whale accumulation trend has also recently been highlighted by crypto smart money tracker Lookonchain. On Thursday, they pointed to three whales accumulating ETH since September 19, November 29, and December 5. Together, these whales have accumulated nearly 82k ETH.\n\nWill ETH Climb Higher?\n\nAs recently reported by DailyCoin, analysts like \u201cDuo Nine\u201d have tipped ETH to clinch the $3k price point. Ali Martinez, another prominent analyst, has also argued that the $2k price point could serve as a strong support level for ETH as over 43 million holders bought at the level and were unlikely to sell there.\n\nAt the time of writing, the asset\u2019s four-hour candle price chart suggests that it is firmly in an uptrend. However, a break of its higher low of around $2,233.35 may give investors pause, indicating a short-term trend change or the beginning of a chart pattern formation.\n\nETH/USD 4-hour candle chart.

        "content": "The market performance of Ethereum has been steadily rising since October, marking a positive and long-lasting trend. Increased buying activity has been the main driver of this positive momentum that has persisted over time, pushing the cryptocurrency beyond the vaunted $2,000 resistance mark and igniting a continuing rally.\n\nThe value of Ethereum has sharply grown as a direct result of this increased demand and market optimism, with its sights set on breaking through the crucial resistance region at $2,300. This upward trend serves as another evidence of the increasing investor trust and general bullishness surrounding Ethereum, thereby solidifying its place in the changing cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum Hits 18-Month Highs, Targets $3,000\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, is rising quickly and has reached levels not seen in the previous 18 months. With a market valuation of $285 billion, ETH is now trading 5.7% higher at $2,375 as of the time of publication. Some speculators have even shared $3,000 price predictions for ETH amid the latest market breakout.\n\nEthereum\u2019s approaching resistance level poses a huge challenge to buyers of the altcoin, including the fixed barrier at $2.5K, which has frequently shown to be a significant roadblock. But if the market is able to recapture this critical area, Ethereum may go on to reach the $2.5K \u2013 or even $3.000 \u2014 in the future.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,358 territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nAs Ethereum breaks down further obstacles, investors and market watchers are keeping a close eye on the situation. A notable indication of the increased interest from institutional investors is the eagerness with which major players like VanEck, BlackRock, and Grayscale are awaiting clearance for Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAccording to Santiment, an on-chain data service, Ethereum has reached $2,349, its highest price since June 2022. The amalgamation of the positive long-term trend indicating a rise in wealth for the leading non-exchange whale wallets and a decrease in sell-off power for the leading exchange whale wallets presents a propitious situation for a steady upward trend.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Non-Exchange Holdings Surge To 55M ETH\n\nA recent tweet from Santinment highlights some intriguing variations in Ethereum\u2019s wallet mechanics. Exchange wallets saw a five-year low of 9.3 million ETH, while top non-exchange wallets are building up to a record 54.6 million ETH. This move points to upward trends, with wealth building through non-exchange transactions and decreased selling pressure.\n\nOver the course of two months, a bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator grew, pointing to a possible overvaluation of Ethereum at this point. Given the current characteristics of the market, even if buyers seem to be in charge and overall sentiment is bullish, there is a significant likelihood of a brief corrective phase that involves consolidation and higher volatility in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, a recent ACDE meeting provided information about the impending Dencun fork of Ethereum, which is set to occur in January 2024. The Goerli network testnet fork was well-prepared for by development teams, opening the door for a larger Goerli shadow network fork in the coming weeks.\n\nACDE#176 happened earlier today: we discussed the state of Dencun, timelines for testnets, and how to approach planning the following network upgrade \u26d3\ufe0f Agenda: https://t.co/ATVLQ7f9Xp\n\nStream: https://t.co/tDM0tDKxC5 Recap below \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/PhGBkYxhYN \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) December 7, 2023\n\nBy using proto-danksharding, Dencun is expected to greatly increase data availability for layer-2 rollups. This improvement should result in lower rollup transaction costs, which will eventually help end customers.\n\nDencun\u2019s overall effects include rollups that increase Ethereum\u2019s scalability, gas fee optimization, improved network security, and the deployment of several housekeeping upgrades.\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s price surges to surpass the $2,300 milestone, speculation intensifies about the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential to reach the next significant threshold of $3,000. The recent upward trajectory reflects the market\u2019s confidence in Ethereum\u2019s underlying technology and its role in the evolving digital landscape.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

        "content": "Market analyst Cryptoes is looking out for a fresh XRP uptrend in the long run, as data suggests XRP has continued to outperform Ethereum (ETH) in 2023 despite recent trends.\n\nTaking to X, Cryptoes shared combined charts detailing XRP\u2019s price movements on a weekly timeframe, and Ethereum\u2019s price movements within the same timeframe. The period of interest spans January 2023 through December 2023.\n\nCryptoes called attention to XRP\u2019s price action throughout this year, which has been primarily encouraging. However, the recollection was necessary amid the waning optimism among XRP investors, as the crypto asset fails to capitalize fully on the recent Bitcoin uptrend.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nXRP Outperforms Ethereum\n\nData from Cryptoes\u2019 chart suggests that XRP has appreciated 116% this year. XRP began January 2023 on a bullish standing, following three consecutive months of decline from October to December 2022.\n\nThe cryptocurrency closed January 2023 at $0.4057 amid a 19.68% increase. This increase ended its monthly losing streak. XRP has continued to register intermittent upswings and declines since then. As of press time, the asset changes hands at $0.6330.\n\nAccording to Cryptoes\u2019 disclosure, Ethereum has also recorded a similar bullish year, but its rate of growth has slowed in comparison to XRP\u2019s. Data from the chart suggests that Ethereum has appreciated 91% since the start of 2023.\n\nDespite XRP\u2019s substantial price upsurge this year, Cryptoes pointed out that the asset still has a long way to go before it can catch up to Ethereum in terms of market capitalization. Notably, ETH boasts a market cap of $270.5 billion, while XRP\u2019s market cap stands at $34 billion.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA Potential Fresh Uptrend\n\nEthereum\u2019s market cap is nearly eight times XRP\u2019s. At the current figures, XRP would need to soar 706% from its current price to a value of $5.08 to hit Ethereum\u2019s market cap. While most market watchers have discussed the possibility of this surge, it remains uncertain.\n\nCiting the current realities, Cryptoes disclosed that he was looking out for a fresh and long-term uptrend for XRP. The Crypto Basic recently revealed that XRP witnessed a similar dull performance at the start of the bull run in 2017. However, the asset eventually outperformed Bitcoin and other tokens.\n\nXRP is up 4.68% over the past week, while ETH has rallied 9.8%. However, interest in XRP remains on the high side, with trade volume seeing a 19% surge in the last 24 hours to $1,936,448,897."

        "content": "Crypto analyst Credibull has again put forward his analysis of Ethereum. After predicting the right next upswing of Bitcoin from the $43K level to enter $44K, the analyst now eyeing a favorable rally for ETH.\n\nThis shows optimism surrounding Ethereum with experts indicating a potential upsurge in the ETH ecosystem.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum To Rally Beyond $3000?\n\nCredibull indicates a potential ETH rally above $2.6k and has predicted that it can happen overnight. He further added that Ethereum will go long and has taken up the position already.\n\nIn a recent X post, replying to a comment regarding Bitcoin rally coinciding with Ethereum\u2019s, he stated that ETH will follow BTC. The analyst predicts Bitcoin to go beyond $50K by next week and Ethereum will follow the same.\n\nIn another analysis, the prominent voice behind the Altcoin Daily crypto channel, Aaron Arnold, anticipates a substantial upswing for Ethereum (ETH) in response to the potential approval of BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nArnold stresses that the approval of this ETF could trigger a significant surge in demand, driving Ethereum\u2019s price to new highs. By examining historical patterns, Arnold suggests that if Ethereum mirrors its performance from the previous bullish cycle, prices could experience a surge to $4,200. Additionally, he underscores the possibility of a more conservative increase, proposing a climb to $2,800.\n\nAlso Read: Terra Luna Classic Burn Hits 85 Billion Milestone Amid Massive LUNC & USTC Rally\n\nEthereum Open Interest Surges $8 Billion\n\nOn December 8, Ethereum\u2019s open interest surged above $8 billion signifying an optimistic market reach.

Development teams are well-prepared for the testnet fork on the Goerli network, paving the way for a broader Goerli shadow network fork in the weeks to come.\n\nACDE#176 happened earlier today: we discussed the state of Dencun, timelines for testnets, and how to approach planning the following network upgrade \u26d3\ufe0f\n\n\n\nAgenda: https://t.co/ATVLQ7f9Xp\n\nStream: https://t.co/tDM0tDKxC5\n\n\n\nRecap below \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/PhGBkYxhYN \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) December 7, 2023\n\nDencun promises enhancements by improving data availability for layer-2 rollups through proto-dank sharding. This tech upgrade aims to lower transaction costs, offering users a more cost-effective experience. Alongside cost benefits, Dencun offers scalability, gas fee optimization, stronger network security, and various updates.\n\nIt\u2019s Not an Easy Path\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation advises users to stick to Goerli for stable testnet environments, urging an early start to the migration process. However, concerns arise as major validators exit, possibly impacting stability. Simultaneously, development teams are deep into testing during this transition phase, covering crucial areas like delayed finality, inactivity leaks, and mass slashings.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum\u2019s recent surge and the impending Dencun Hardfork bring excitement to the crypto scene.

        "content": "A prominent market analyst recently shared a bullish forecast for Ethereum (ETH), which could reach $28,000. However, amidst the buzz surrounding ETH\u2019s predicted surge, two other tokens, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Meme Moguls (MGLS), have also made headlines. They emerge as key contenders, commanding attention for their potentially explosive gains.\n\n>> Can You Predict The Next 1000x Meme Coin? Become A Meme Mogul Today <<\n\nAnalyst Foresees Impressive Ethereum (ETH) Price Surge\n\nIn a recent analysis by Aaron Arnold, the prominent voice behind the Altcoin Daily crypto channel, Ethereum (ETH), is expected to witness a substantial upsurge in response to the potential approval of Blackrock\u2019s ETF. Arnold emphasized that this ETF approval might cause a significant demand surge, propelling the Ethereum price to new highs.\n\nArnold looked into historical patterns, indicating that if Ethereum follows a trajectory similar to its performance during the previous bullish cycle, the prices could soar to $42,000. He also highlighted the possibility of a more conservative increase, suggesting a climb to $28,000.\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent growth, from $1,802 to $2,027 between October 31 and November 30, further supports these optimistic projections. Currently trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs, Ethereum appears poised for an upward trajectory. Because of this, experts have made a bullish Ethereum price prediction \u2013 a rise to $2,309 before the conclusion of 2023.\n\nPlena Finance Welcomes Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nA prominent player in the blockchain technology sphere, Plena Finance recently expanded the offerings within its cryptocurrency super app by introducing additional tokens, one of which includes Shiba Inu (SHIB). This strategic move by Plena opens up new ways for users to partake in asset swaps and transactions involving Shiba Inu within its ecosystem.\n\nIn response to this development, the Shiba Inu price rose from $0.0000080 on November 28 to $0.0000082 on November 30. Additionally, the Shiba Inu Fear & Greed Index currently indicates a 74 (Greed) sentiment, indicating optimistic market sentiments surrounding SHIB.\n\nDue to all these reasons, market analysts remain bullish with their Shiba Inu price predictions. They foresee a potential SHIB surge to $0.000009 by the conclusion of 2023, showing good growth for this crypto.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) Setting New Presale Records\n\nAccording to Statista, the meme industry may reach a value of $6.1B by 2025 \u2013 and Meme Moguls (MGLS) aims to capitalize on it. This innovative meme-backed stock market platform operates on the blockchain and will allow users to trade memes and earn rewards simultaneously.\n\nThis groundbreaking initiative has sparked a frenzy within the crypto community. Meme Moguls has already broken a record by completing the Beta stage of its presale in just one week. During that time, the MGLS token value increased by 10% and now costs only $0.0021. Therefore, traders are stockpiling it before its price soars again.\n\nWhile the exchange is the cornerstone of Meme Moguls, the project\u2019s roadmap outlines three additional offerings to establish a vast ecosystem. These are:\n\nMoguls Casino is a gaming platform utilizing meme-based assets.\n\nis a gaming platform utilizing meme-based assets. Meme Moguls Fantasy Trader will enable you to connect with other traders and engage in healthy competition.\n\nwill enable you to connect with other traders and engage in healthy competition. Mogul Land is an immersive metaverse facilitating diverse financial activities like token mining.\n\nThe MGLS token powers all these aspects while also providing governance and staking rewards to holders.\n\nUnlike Ethereum and Shiba Inu, MGLS has a lower market cap. In other words, its room for growth is higher as fewer new funds are needed. Analysts are optimistic, foreseeing a potential 1,000% growth trajectory for the MGLS token upon its debut on exchanges. Those who purchase it now may capitalize on this growth and gain a 30% deposit bonus.\n\nFor more information about the Meme Moguls (MGLS) presale:\n\nWebsite: https://mememoguls.com/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.mememoguls.com/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/meme_moguls\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

It\u2019s due to a sizable boost in Solana trades, which have seen their volume grow about 92% in the past day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTensorians, which is tied to the Tensor NFT marketplace, is the top traded project during that span with over $4 million worth of sales.\n\nTensor, which rose to prominence earlier this year, is currently dominating on Solana with nearly 76% market share over the past 24 hours per data from Tiexo.

        "content": "According to cryptocurrency analysis firm LookonChain, an Ethereum (ETH) whale might sell its holdings after laying dormant for five years. According to the analysis firm, the whale received 47,260 ETH, worth $11.34 million, from June to August 2017. The whale\u2019s average cost per coin was around $240. Since 2017, ETH\u2019s price has gone up by around 838%.\n\nLookonChain notes that the whale wallet transferred 39,260 ETH, worth $87.5 million, to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken on Dec. 5, 2023. If the whale sells its holdings, it would make a profit of around $78 million.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum NFT Market Booms: Transaction Volume Hits $34 Million\n\nAn early $ETH whale appears to be selling ETH again after being dormant for 5 years.\n\n\n\nThe whale deposited all 39,260 $ETH($87.5M) to #Kraken 30 mins ago.\n\n\n\nThe whale received 47,260 $ETH($11.34M) at ~$240 from June to August 2017.\n\n\n\nIf sold the whale would make a profit of ~$78M. pic.twitter.com/v0PI4LNTKO \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 5, 2023\n\nWill the Ethereum whale sell?\n\nSource: Bitcoinist\n\nThe movement of assets to exchanges is bearish, given that it increases the chances of being sold. The whale may sell its Ethereum (ETH) holdings while booking profits. The wallet in question has made a profit of $78 million already.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: Vitalik Buterin Wants to Redesign the Network\n\nWhen Ethereum (ETH) reached its all-time high of $4878.26 in November 2021, the whale\u2019s holdings were worth around $230 million. Analysts anticipate a bull market for the cryptocurrency sector in 2024. ETH and other assets, such as Bitcoin (BTC), may hit new all-time highs next year. Hence, the whale\u2019s holdings could surge in value over the next few months. Therefore, the wallet might not sell its holdings just yet.\n\nSome analysts expect ETH to hit a price of $10,000 in the next bull run. In such a scenario, the whale\u2019s holdings could be worth around $472.6 million. It is unlikely that the investor, or group of investors, would want to miss out on an opportunity to make almost half a billion dollars.\n\nIt is also possible that the wallet is simply reorganizing its holdings and is temporarily keeping its Ethereum (ETH) in an exchange. The ETH may find its way back into a hard wallet soon."

These tokens will be directly, indirectly, and retroactively distributed to Starknet DeFi users, according to the Starknet Foundation.\n\nStarknet community members were quick to celebrate the announcement, hailing it as a major boon for the blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n$Stark is about the community, 1.8B tokens for the community, 50M token for Defi chads.. multipliers incoming..! \u2014 BMS (@bloomstarbms) December 8, 2023\n\nAnd they have good reason to be in high spirits: similar airdrops made by other blockchain projects have flooded crypto users with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of free tokens in recent weeks.\n\nOn Thursday, a similar airdrop by Solana-based DeFi platform Jito put $225 million worth of freshly minted JTO tokens in the hands of users and community members. Late last month, an airdrop for DeFi oracles network Pyth gave away $77 million worth of PYTH tokens.\n\nAirdrops have become an increasingly popular way for crypto projects\u2014and recently, DeFi projects in particular\u2014to attract a larger user base and encourage loyalty among existing community members.\n\nStarknet, which uses zero-knowledge rollups to make on-chain Ethereum transactions faster and cheaper, has already seen tremendous growth this year. This spring, the network\u2019s total value locked (TVL) increased ten-fold, from $1.45 million to over $10 million. Since then Starknet\u2019s TVL has tripled again, to $33.84 million at writing, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Ethereum, alongside the rest of the crypto market, experienced a notable resurgence in the past several weeks, with its price jumping to a 19-month peak at $2,400. This comes amid growing anticipation regarding the approval of a spot ETH ETF in the States.\n\nHowever, the second-largest blockchain network has not seen its user count increase, which leads to the question of whether ETH\u2019s price will climb further should that change.\n\nNo New Users for Ethereum\n\nAs mentioned above, the crypto market seems to have put behind the devastating 2022 crash and bear cycle as the prices of numerous assets, including ETH, have shot up to their highest levels in almost two years. The total crypto market cap has risen by over half a trillion in the past few months.\n\nEthereum, being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is among the most popular assets, especially for users aiming for DeFi, NFTs, or other niches that employ the blockchain. However, data from IntoTheBlock shows that there hasn\u2019t been much interest from new users to come on board lately.\n\nDespite the bullish market conditions, Ethereum is not seeing a significant influx of new users. Both the number of new addresses and the new adoption rate show no significant spikes. What do you think this means?\n\n\ud83d\udd17https://t.co/gyjfRaU3C9 pic.twitter.com/jKoe7AOuCY \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 8, 2023\n\nWhy Is That So Strange?\n\nThis is particularly interesting and perhaps unexpected in the current environment. Retail investors tend to follow the hype. Such hype has indeed returned to the markets \u2013 BTC and ETH in particular. This is because of the growing number of entities filing to launch spot BTC and ETH ETFs in the United States.\n\nFor example, the number of Bitcoin addresses and active users keeps climbing, with non-zero balance wallets recently surpassing the 50 million mark. So, the hype for Bitcoin is definitely here, but this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with Ethereum.\n\nBut then again, that can all change in an instant, especially if the US Securities and Exchange Commission does indeed approve a spot Ethereum ETF soon. Should that happen, ETH\u2019s price could skyrocket even further with the growing number of users and investors."

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nTLDR\n\nEthereum, FLOKI, and NuggetRush have caught the interest of smart money.\n\nNuggetRush stands out for its blend of P2E and memes.\n\nAnalysts predict its value will soar by 60x.\n\nThe smart money with a track record of success is currently accumulating Ethereum (ETH), FLOKI (FLOKI), and NuggetRush (NUGX). They probably know something we don\u2019t. Nevertheless, these cryptocurrencies have significant upside potential, so it comes as little surprise.\n\nThis article will cover the appeal of Ethereum, FLOKI, and NuggetRush, including why smart money has taken a keen interest. Let\u2019s begin.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX): Investor Favorite\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) is a top ICO (initial coin offering). The significance is that it has more upside potential as an emerging project than Ethereum and FLOKI. This makes up one of its several appeals. In addition, it also distinguishes itself for its unique approach, which has contributed to the massive token demand.\n\nUnlike many memecoins without tangible utility, NuggetRush has been hailed for its fascinating blend of memes and utility. It stands at the intersection of P2E (play-to-earn) and memes, two of the biggest narratives in the crypto landscape. As a result, it has captured the interest of investors as well as enthusiasts.\n\nAs a gaming platform, it promises fun and thrills. Gamers will enjoy an immersive and thrilling gameplay experience and will be rewarded for their time while playing the gold mining game. The in-game assets collected by players can be traded or exchanged in the marketplace.\n\nThis project is still in its early stages; hence, it has significant growth potential. The presale is in its third round, and a token costs only $0.013. According to top experts, it has a 60x upside potential, making it the best new crypto to invest in. If you wish to participate in the presale, simply follow the link below.\n\n>> Buy NuggetRush Now <<\n\nEthereum (ETH): Undervalued with Substantial Growth Potential\n\nEthereum (ETH) is one of the most dominant tokens in the crypto scene. Yet, it is ridiculously undervalued. With massive upside potential, it is one of the best coins to invest in. That isn\u2019t all. Ethereum plays a critical role in the crypto space, particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world.\n\nIt is a blockchain and smart contract platform. It also houses other cryptocurrencies, making it the most vibrant ecosystem in the crypto landscape. This combination of massive growth potential and practicality has resulted in smart money quietly accumulating Ethereum tokens.\n\nMoreover, the impending approval of the first spot Ethereum ETF in the US is expected to usher in a bullish wave. Hence, it is one of the best cryptos to invest in.\n\nFLOKI (FLOKI): A Promising Memecoin\n\nThe memecoin ecosystem is incomplete without mentioning FLOKI (FLOKI). Popularly called the \u201cpeople currency,\u201d it is the utility token of the FLOKI ecosystem. Although it was initially just a memecoin, it is now much more, making it a good crypto to buy.\n\nThe FLOKI ecosystem now consists of an NFT gaming metaverse and DeFi products. Its blend of memes and utility has made it a favorite in the crypto landscape. Furthermore, it has massive upside potential and is currently trading in an uptrend.\n\nGiven the above, it is a no-brainer that smart money is purchasing FLOKI in large quantities. It is, after all, one of the best cryptos to buy now.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe smart money accumulation of Ethereum, FLOKI, and NuggetRush is because of their significant role and growth potential. They appear primed for explosive gains, which makes them worthwhile investments. You can purchase ETH or FLOKI on popular exchanges.

Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum price squashed the bearish pressure with a strong rebound and is now heading towards the pivotal resistance\n\nThe token displays extreme strength, which forecasts a positive outlook in the long term, aiming to form a new ATH at the earliest\n\nThe crypto markets appear to have flipped over their bearish claws as the bulls have gained immense strength. The majority of cryptos have been maintaining a steep upswing since the start of the month, which indicates the markets are progressing towards a strong bull run. As the Bitcoin price sustains above $43,000, the Ethereum price is also on the verge of marking new yearly highs close to $2400.\n\nEthereum has been considered one of the most reliable cryptos on the market and is known for its slow and steady pace. The rising momentum of the markets and specifically the ETH price may have compelled retail traders to accumulate more. Moreover, they are reportedly holding the tokens away from the exchanges as the exchange volume is constantly depleting.\n\nAs per the data from Santiment, the non-exchange addresses held have now marked new highs.\n\nThe rise in the volume of non-exchange addresses, which has hit an ATH of 54.6 million compared to the 150 biggest exchange addresses, marking a 5-year low at 9.3 million, suggests the whales are probably losing sell-off power. As retail traders are getting stronger with this move, a fine rise in the price is expected in the coming days. A popular analyst, Michael van de Poppe, believes that the ETH price could soar and reach $3000 somewhere in Q1 of 2024.\n\n#Ethereum starts to rally against $BTC.\n\n\n\nIn the period prior to the #Bitcoin halving, 3-8 months before, it's the best period to allocate towards altcoins.\n\n\n\nRight now, we might be seeing the exact same on $ETH, which means that Ethereum is ready for $3,000+ in Q1. pic.twitter.com/9HPzTeIK6A \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 7, 2023\n\nCollectively, Ethereum\u2019s price has displayed extreme bullish momentum since the start of the month, and hence, a bullish close for the year could be on the horizon. Meanwhile, market sentiments have also turned bullish, substantiating the bullish claim and supporting the price target above $3000 in the first few weeks of 2024."

        "content": "Ethereum experienced a modest dip during the early hours of Thursday, a development that, quite frankly, was long overdue.\n\nEthereum, in tandem with Bitcoin and numerous other cryptocurrencies, has undergone a remarkable surge in recent times.\n\nHowever, in the interest of fostering a healthy market, a revival of value is essential. The initial upward trajectory in the market has transitioned into a phase of consolidation or a mild pullback.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nShould consolidation be the path ahead, it is probable that we'll witness a period of sideways movement lasting several days. This period offers an opportune window for investors to identify favorable entry points. When a market experiences an abrupt ascent, it is prudent to exercise caution and avoid chasing trades. Alternatively, one might consider the potential for a substantial pullback, an occurrence that could provide substantial value. The $2100 level emerges as a point of interest in this context, as it carries a certain \"market memory\" due to its previous role as a significant resistance level. Consequently, one can reasonably anticipate robust support if Ethereum approaches this threshold.\n\nThe Bottom?\n\nBeneath this pivotal level lies the $1925 zone, which I regard as the termination point of the current trend. This level coincides with the presence of the 50-Day EMA and signifies a former area of substantial support. Only when Ethereum breaches this juncture would legitimate concerns regarding its market trajectory come into play. However, it is imperative to keep a vigilant eye on Bitcoin's performance before making any investment decisions, as Ethereum traditionally mirrors Bitcoin's movements. Despite the prevailing speculation suggesting Ethereum may need to catch up to Bitcoin, implying the potential for a more pronounced upward movement when the cryptocurrency market rallies again, I maintain a decidedly bullish outlook for Ethereum.\n\nIn essence, Ethereum's recent correction is not a sign of inherent weakness but rather a necessary step to establish a more sustainable foundation for future growth. The market's ability to attract fresh capital and maintain healthy price levels hinges on this process of consolidation or mild retracement. As cryptocurrency markets remain dynamic and ever evolving, it is crucial for investors to navigate with prudence, strategically assessing entry points and heeding the broader context of the digital asset landscape. While volatility persists, the long-term prospects for Ethereum remain promising, with the $2100 and $1925 levels serving as key waypoints to monitor in the journey forward.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD?

        "content": "Fri 08 Dec 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nBitcoin has long played the role of the undisputed leader, paving the way for its crypto brethren. But, as in any good epic tale, a challenger arises: Ethereum. As we approach the end of 2023, we might be witnessing the dawn of a new era, where the altcoin is no longer content to follow but aims to compete. Is it the season of altcoins? In this financial ballet, Ethereum sketches a daring dance to catch up with the Bitcoin giant. Let\u2019s analyze this captivating plot together.\n\nCrypto ETH: The Phoenix of Altcoins?\n\nYesterday, a remarkable event occurred: Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency reached a new annual high of $2,312, demonstrating resilience worthy of a phoenix.\n\nWith a 10.28% progression in one week, Ether is no longer the timid younger sibling following in its elder\u2019s footsteps. Against a still-dominating Bitcoin, this crypto seems to whisper a promise: \u201cNothing is played out yet.\u201d This meteoric rise, although impressive, asks a burning question: how high can Ether go in this frenzied race?\n\nETH, like a maestro, has masterfully directed its dance around a graphical triangle, signaling a bullish target of $2,780. This geometric figure is not just a crypto trader\u2019s whim; it is a strategy, a meticulously planned plot.\n\nThe Ichimoku indicators, with their colorful curves, seem to play a harmonious melody, supporting this ascent. But beware, every story has its twists. If ETH falls below its protective cloud, this dream of $2,780 may vanish, reminding us that falls are always possible.\n\nETH: The New Hero?\n\nSo, are we witnessing the emergence of a new hero in this crypto saga? Ethereum, with its current configuration, seems to have all the trumps to hit its target. But in this world where caution is queen, keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is as unpredictable as a stormy ocean.\n\nThe question remains: Can Ethereum, strengthened by its ascent, truly reach $2,780 before the end of the year, and in this odyssey, can it redefine the rules of the game established by Bitcoin?\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum\u2019s rise is more than just a market fluctuation; it is a true digital odyssey, redefining the dynamics of power in the world of cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin continues to dominate, Ether, with its recent performance, prompts deep reflection on the future of altcoins. Is it a mere resurgence, or are we witnessing the dawn of an era where altcoins, led by Ethereum, play a leading role? The future, albeit encrypted, looks thrilling. In a world where surprise is the only constant, one thing is certain: the crypto realm will continue to mesmerize, astonish, and perhaps, overturn established titans.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "At 12.15 a.m., BTC was trading 1.3% lower at $43,375, while the second most popular token, Ethereum, was up 4.8% at $2,373.Other popular altcoins, such as Solana and Cardano advanced 14% and 6%, respectively. Also, BNB , Avalanche, Tron, Chainlink, Polkadot, Siba Inu, and Litecoin surged. On the other hand, XRP Dogecoin , and Toncoin declined.BTC encountered a dip to $43,000 during the day, pulling back from its swift ascent to nearly $45,000 earlier this week. This suggests that traders opted to secure profits after the largest crypto's breakout from $38,000 a week ago, said CoinDCX Research Team.On the flip side, ETH witnessed a 5% upswing over the same period, reaching $2,372, marking its highest level since May 2022. This upward movement also positively influenced the prices of other ETH-related cryptocurrencies, positioning them as the top performers of the day. Ethereum's upsurge is credited to heightened institutional interest and the hopeful anticipation of an ETF approval by the SEC, CoinDCX added.\"From a technical standpoint, BTC is currently situated at the $44,000 resistance level. The overall momentum remains positive, with no clear signals of a reversal or bearish trend. Minor pullbacks and corrections are considered healthy for the current scenario,\" CoinDCX said.Meanwhile, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \"The current phase of sideways correction is good for building steam for the next leg-up. If this trend continues, analysts predict the next stop for BTC will be $46,000.\"The total volume in DeFi is currently $8 billion, 10.77% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $65.78 billion, which is 88.55% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency , fell to $848 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 52.65%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours rose 7.91% to $28.25 billion."

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) is making very strong moves hitting levels not seen in the last 18 months. As of press time, ETH is trading 5.61% up at a price of $2,375 with a market cap of $285 billion. Amid the recent price breakout, some investors have already been sharing ETH price targets of $3,500.\n\nTraders in the cryptocurrency market are currently grappling with apprehensions of a potential bull trap. Although Bitcoin has momentarily halted its momentum, the spotlight shifts to Ethereum and various altcoins, which are experiencing significant upward surges once again.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Non-Exchange Wallets Accumulate\n\nOn-chain data shows a contrasting behavior between non-exchange and exchange wallets. The top 150 non-exchange wallet addresses are holding an all-time stash of Ethereum at 54.6 million ETH. On the other hand, the exchange wallet holdings have dropped to a 5-year low at 9.3 million ETH.\n\nOn-chain data provider Santiment reports that Ethereum has climbed to $2,349, marking its highest level since June 2022. The encouraging combination of the long-term trend showing an increase in wealth for the top non-exchange whale wallets and reduced sell-off power for the top exchange whale wallets suggests a promising scenario for a sustained ascent.\n\nAll Eyes on Ethereum Dencun Upgrade\n\nDuring the recent ACDE meeting, developers highlighted that Ethereum is on track to execute the Dencun fork of the Goerli testnet in January 2024, pending smooth progress. The majority of teams are prepared to conduct the testnet fork test, and plans are in place for a more extensive Goerli shadow network fork in the coming weeks.\n\nACDE#176 happened earlier today: we discussed the state of Dencun, timelines for testnets, and how to approach planning the following network upgrade \u26d3\ufe0f Agenda: https://t.co/ATVLQ7f9Xp\n\nStream: https://t.co/tDM0tDKxC5 Recap below \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/PhGBkYxhYN \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) December 7, 2023\n\nDencun is set to significantly boost data availability for layer-2 rollups through proto-danksharding. This enhancement is likely to lead to a decrease in transaction costs for rollups, ultimately benefiting end users. The overall impact of Dencun includes the improvement of Ethereum\u2019s scalability through rollups, optimization of gas fees, enhancement of network security, and implementation of various housekeeping updates.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is recommending users who depend on Goerli for stable testnet environments to initiate the migration process in advance. While Goerli staking is permissionless, the exit of validators associated with client and testing teams, holding a substantial majority stake, introduces potential stability concerns. Simultaneously, teams are preparing to utilize this transition period to test aspects such as delayed finality, inactivity leaks, and mass-slashings."

        "content": "Fri 08 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nHas Ethereum become more centralized? The crypto community is sounding the alarm. Indeed, censorship is starting to gain ground on this very popular blockchain. Currently, 4 out of 5 of the largest \u201cblock builders\u201d on the network are filtering transactions sanctioned by the U.S. government. Let\u2019s take a closer look!\n\nAn Increasingly Centralized Ethereum\n\nVitalik Buterin was recently subjected to a public lynching while presenting the new Ethereum roadmap. Why attack such a Web3 icon in this way? In fact, he talked about a possible use of the UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) approach to revise ETH staking. The blockchain he co-founded is so lacking in decentralization that it will have to borrow more innovative and decentralized concepts from other projects.\n\nMore than 72% of Ethereum\u2019s block builders are \"censoring\" transactions sanctioned by U.S. govt OFAC, data shows, underscoring how \u201ccredibly neutral\u201d blockchains have become more centralized as a result of MEV @skesslr reports $ETHhttps://t.co/BIPGuze7LX \u2014 CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) December 7, 2023\n\nIn a detailed report focused on \u201cEthereum\u2019s \u2018censorship\u2019 problem,\u201d CoinDesk highlighted the disappointment of some researchers and users of the world\u2019s second-largest blockchain. The reason: censorship is starting to make its mark on this network.\n\nAccording to the results of a study conducted by Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, 72% of the blocks of data displayed on MEV-Boost are currently being censored. As a reminder, MEV-Boost is the intermediary software powering the validators writing blocks on the Ethereum network.\n\n72%, that\u2019s really alarming considering that Ethereum block builders only filtered 25% of transactions in November 2022.\n\nAmong the 5 largest block builders of Ethereum, only \u201cTitan Builder\u201d disapproves of this practice. Martin K\u00f6ppelmann, founder of Gnosis Chain, sounded the alarm by stating:\n\n\u201cIf Titan started to censor tomorrow, Ethereum would be censored by more than 90%. So we\u2019re only one constructor away from strong censorship on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nOFAC in Action\n\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) appears to be behind all this commotion. Indeed, by targeting Tornado Cash, with a lawsuit to boot, this branch of the U.S. Treasury Department has, in a way, put pressure on Ethereum block builders. It\u2019s important to note this very important fact: Tornado Cash is an Ethereum-based \u201cprivate mixing\u201d program that allows traceless transactions.\n\nAfter OFAC decided to close down the tunnel through which stolen cryptos by North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group, as well as funds fueling terrorist organizations like Hamas or countries sanctioned by the United States such as Iran and Russia, transits. By adding the computer code of Ethereum-based Tornado to its blacklist, the U.S. regulator would have achieved its intended goals.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Shiba Inu, commonly known as SHIB, is a cryptocurrency that emerged in August 2020. It was created by an anonymous entity known as \u201cRyoshi.\u201d Named after the Japanese dog breed and often categorized as a \u201cmeme coin,\u201d SHIB has gained significant popularity, partly riding on the wave created by Dogecoin. As an ERC-20 token, SHIB is built on the Ethereum blockchain, benefiting from Ethereum\u2019s robust and secure network. Unlike Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply, SHIB started with a quadrillion tokens, with a notable portion burned or removed from circulation by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who also donated a part to charity.\n\nSHIB is central to a larger ecosystem that includes other tokens like LEASH and BONE, each serving unique roles within this ecosystem. The Shiba Inu community also developed ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange platform for trading and staking tokens. While SHIB is often seen as a speculative investment with high volatility, it maintains a strong presence and community engagement in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAccording to data from TradingView, as of 4:05 p.m. UTC on 9 December 2023, SHIB is trading at around $0.00001031, up nearly 20% in the past 24-hour period.\n\nThe Shiba Inu community, engaging in discussions on platform X, compared Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees and speed with those of Shibarium. Clifford, a user on the platform, noted that Ethereum\u2019s transaction fee, though lower than the initially claimed $31.62 at $1.33, was still much higher than Shibarium\u2019s modest fee of $0.043 per transaction.\n\nAnother community member emphasized Shibarium\u2019s economic efficiency and scalability, pointing out that while Ethereum processes around 13-14 transactions per second, Shibarium manages five times that amount within the same timeframe.\n\nAnd also ETH is handling 13-14 transactions per second and #Shibarium is probably handling 5 times more per second.\n\nEconomical and scalable. \u2014 Shib Mehta (@shib_mehta) December 7, 2023\n\nShytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu\u2019s lead developer, contributed to the discussion by stating that Shibarium can process up to 200 transactions per second. Echoing this, Kaal Dhairya confirmed that Shibarium\u2019s current rate of 200 transactions per second is due to the present block limit for certain transactions.\n\nDhairya also revealed that Shibarium\u2019s actual capacity far exceeds 200 transactions per second and shared plans to further increase Shibarium\u2019s processing speed in the upcoming hard fork, allowing the network to handle a larger volume of transactions.\n\nActually it\u2019s 200/ sec as per the current block limit for certain type of transactions, capacity is way higher and it will be increased with the increase in block capacity in the next hard fork \u2014 Kaal (@kaaldhairya) December 7, 2023\n\nAs of the latest report, Shibarium has processed a total of 68,185,683 (68.18 million) transactions. Remarkably, since 2 December 2023, the network has consistently processed over 7 million transactions daily. Shibariumscan data shows that the network recorded 7.89 million transactions the previous day.\n\nFeatured Image via Unsplash"

        "content": "In recent weeks, the cryptocurrency market has witnessed a significant resurgence, with Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain network by market capitalization, leading the charge. Ethereum\u2019s price has soared to a 19-month high of $2,400, marking a remarkable recovery from the 2022 market downturn. This price increase comes when the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has expanded by over half a trillion dollars in just a few months. The rise in Ethereum\u2019s value coincides with heightened anticipation of a potential approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States, a development that could significantly influence the market.\n\nDespite this price escalation, Ethereum has not seen a corresponding increase in its user base. This situation is peculiar, considering the general tendency of retail investors to gravitate towards trending assets. The lack of new user growth on Ethereum\u2019s network, as indicated by data from IntoTheBlock, presents a curious scenario in the context of the current market enthusiasm.\n\nDespite the bullish market conditions, Ethereum is not seeing a significant influx of new users. Both the number of new addresses and the new adoption rate show no significant spikes. What do you think this means?\n\n\ud83d\udd17https://t.co/gyjfRaU3C9 pic.twitter.com/jKoe7AOuCY \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 8, 2023\n\nComparative analysis with Bitcoin\n\nThe market\u2019s enthusiasm contrasts sharply with Bitcoin\u2019s user growth. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen a consistent increase in its user base. The number of Bitcoin addresses and active users has been steadily climbing, with wallets holding a non-zero balance recently surpassing the 50 million mark. This growth in Bitcoin\u2019s user base indicates the strong interest and hype surrounding it, a trend not mirrored by Ethereum despite its price rise.\n\nThis discrepancy raises questions about Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics and future potential as there is an increasing interest in spot BTC and ETH ETFs in the United States. However, it is essential to understand that Ethereum\u2019s price might experience further growth if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves a spot Ethereum ETF, potentially attracting a new wave of users and investors.\n\nEthereum\u2019s future outlook\n\nThe current state of Ethereum\u2019s market points to a complex interplay between price dynamics and user engagement. The lack of new users joining the Ethereum network despite its price rally suggests a divergence from typical market behavior. Retail investors, who often fuel market movements through their collective actions, seem to be more cautious or selective in their approach towards Ethereum.\n\nAs stated earlier, the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the U.S. could alter this scenario dramatically. Such an event might not only boost Ethereum\u2019s price but could also catalyze an influx of new users and investors, broadening the network\u2019s base and reinforcing its market position.\n\nAt the time of press, Ethereum is trading at $2,350, decreasing by 0.02% in the last 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nIn preparation for the new year, investors have been looking for the best crypto investment opportunities. The state of the market has been very positive these past months, which has led to optimistic predictions for many cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum (ETH). Token Terminal, an analytics tool, has projected that Ethereum may reach $36,800 by 2030. This suggests that Ethereum\u2019s advantages over new DeFi projects and network expansion point to an 18X increase by the decade\u2019s end.\n\nAs market optimism grows, Polkadot (DOT) and InQubeta (QUBE) have exceeded expectations. DOT recently staged a recovery, surging from its $3.55 low. At the same time, QUBE continues to deliver on promised profits during its crypto ICO, pulling in investors with milestone achievements and a constant push to new highs. These performances have revived interest in Polkadot and increased investor confidence in InQubeta.\n\nLet\u2019s explore Ethereum\u2019s projection while examining Polkadot\u2019s and InQubeta\u2019s price surges.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s (QUBE) Impressive Presale Performance Pushes It To Deliver Explosive Gains\n\nWhen InQubeta launched the presale of its native token, QUBE, early this year, many thought that it was like other new DeFi projects that tried to jump on the AI trend. Surprisingly, the token went through multiple rallies as each stage ended. The platform\u2019s use of AI in a niche way, combined with its impressive presale milestone of millions of dollars raised, has earned InQubeta massive demand for the QUBE token and a rapid 130% surge.\n\nThe crypto ICO event sells QUBE for $0.0161, with the potential for investors to pocket 90% of the profit when QUBE hits $0.0308 at the end of the presale. Investors will still see serious gains when QUBE debuts on top-performing exchanges like Uniswap and trading activity skyrockets. The event has so far sold over 550 million tokens and raised $5.5 million, setting InQubeta on the path to becoming one of the most valuable DeFi companies by the decade\u2019s end.\n\nThe platform plans to create crowdfunding for AI startups by helping them list NFTs representing investment opportunities in AI technologies on InQubeta\u2019s NFT marketplace. When investors buy these NFTs, they\u2019re investing in the AI industry, which is expected to be worth more than a trillion dollars by the decade\u2019s end. Interest in artificial intelligence is at an all-time high, and InQubeta is the best crypto investment to get a piece of the AI sector\u2019s growth.\n\nSome things that have earned InQubeta massive demand are that its NFTs are fractionalized, meaning they\u2019re budget-friendly. The platform also has staking benefits that provide extra income for QUBE holders when they stake their tokens on the platform. Only a handful of DeFi companies offer this kind of value; they\u2019re all expensive to invest in. But InQubeta is still in its presale stage, offering investors a window to get QUBE at a discount.\n\nPolkadot (DOT) Surges Due To Strong Protocol Security\n\nPolkadot has been making smart moves towards implementing strong developments to its protocol. They recently launched anti-scam bounty initiatives to reduce the number of scams on the platform. Since the initiative\u2019s release last year, DOT has won over more investment than it previously had. Other plans for a partial migration to decentralized teams in the ecosystem have increased the long-term stability of DOT, and rewards for these initiatives are already showing. DOT has been trending since October, shooting upwards by over 60% from $3.56 to a high of 5.89, reviving investors\u2019 interest in Polkadot.\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) Network Development Hints At Potential Token Rally To $36,800\n\nToken Terminal recently did a deep analysis of Ethereum and found several developments that could boost the cryptocurrency to explosive heights. It was reported that the scarcity of ETH and Ethereum\u2019s successful switch to proof of stake could quicken its token\u2019s rally to $36,800. Token Terminal also observed that although Ethereum has inconsistent gas fees and shaky scalability, ETH is still on track to dominate because its first-mover advantages and network innovation give it an edge over the competition. Token Terminal added that by 2030, a large chunk of the finance sector\u2019s revenue will be circulating Ethereum\u2014 at an estimated value of $14 trillion.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe recent performance of cryptocurrencies shows this is one of the best seasons to invest in them. Investors currently in Ethereum are bound to pocket some life-changing gains if it grows to hit its expected 18X growth by 2030. At the same time, holders of DOT and QUBE have already started seeing gains as Polkadot and InQubeta rally. As the market gears up for a massive uptrend next year, new investors should consider investing in the InQubeta presale. Industry experts are optimistic that InQubeta could dominate AI cryptos in no time because of its mouthwatering benefits, and the presale is the best way to maximize earnings.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"
