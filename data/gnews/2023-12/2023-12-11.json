        "title": "How to Stake Ethereum - Investopedia",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin. Recently, Ethereum changed its consensus mechanism to allow anyone to participate in staking, the process of locking up ETH tokens to help secure the Ethereum network and earn rewards in return.\n\nWhen you stake ETH, you are essentially acting as a validator for the network. Randomly chosen validators holding a minimum amount of ETH are responsible for verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. In exchange for your work, you earn freshly minted ETH and portions of network transaction fees.\n\n\n\nThis article will explore Ethereum staking and its benefits and risks, as well as share tips for finding a reliable and trustworthy staking platform based on criteria such as security, fees, and reputation.\n\nKey Takeaways Ethereum staking involves committing ether to validate transactions on the Ethereum network and earn ETH for your efforts.\n\nEthereum can be staked independently or through a third party such as a crypto wallet, exchange, or staking pool.\n\nEthereum replaced its energy-intensive, computation-driven Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining consensus mechanism with a financially-governed Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to address environmental, scalability, and centralization concerns.\n\n\n\nEthereum staking carries the benefits of passive income, network security contribution, governance influence, ecological sustainability, and capital appreciation but also the risks of hardware expenses, cybersecurity threats, technical malfunctioning, prolonged investment opportunity costs, and financial penalties.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Staking\n\nEthereum staking was made possible after the network transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, also known as Ethereum 2.0 or Eth2, in September 2022. Ethereum staking is not just possible after it switched to PoS, it's essential for the Ethereum blockchain to function.\n\nBefore the switch, computational consensus was used to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. Similar to Bitcoin's PoW system, which allows participants to earn newly minted BTC, Ethereum cryptocurrency miners competed to solve complex mathematical puzzles, and the first to solve the puzzle would earn the right to add the next block and receive a reward in ETH. PoW was energy-intensive and required specialized hardware.\n\nAfter the switch, social consensus became used to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. Validators can now stake their ETH to participate in the network, and are chosen randomly to add blocks and earn rewards. PoS is significantly less energy-intensive and does not require specialized hardware.\n\nThe transition from PoW to PoS, known as \"The Merge,\" marked a significant milestone in Ethereum's development, addressing key concerns of energy consumption, scalability, and centralization associated with PoW.\n\nPoW consumed vast energy, raising environmental concerns and the overall cost of maintaining the Ethereum network. Additionally, reliance on computational power limited the network's scalability and favored miners with access to specialized hardware and cheap electricity. Centralization of network power hindered Ethereum's ability to handle a growing number of transactions and users.\n\nHow to Stake Ethereum\n\nUsers who want to participate in Ethereum staking have the option of solo staking, staking-as-a-service, or pooled staking. The tradeoffs and trust assumptions of staking independently or through an intermediary vary.\n\nIn general, staking-as-a-service and pooled staking are good options for those with smaller amounts of ETH, as there may be no minimum deposit requirement. Solo staking offers the highest potential rewards, but it requires a higher minimum deposit requirement and a capital investment associated with the purchase and maintenance of hardware for a node. This computer will act as a validator.\n\nMinimum deposit requirements for staking-as-a-service and pooled staking, if there are any, are lower than for solo taking. Some exchanges and wallets may require a minimum deposit of as little as 0.1 ETH to 5 ETH worth of cryptocurrency. Staking solo will always require a minimum stake of 32 ETH, the amount required to run a validator node on the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\nHardware costs for the Ethereum validator node start at $1000 to $2000 and can go up from there, depending on the specific components and their quality and whether these components break down, become outdated, and need to be replaced.\n\nSolo Staking\n\nSolo staking is when you set up your staking node, run the software on your hardware, and generate and hold the node's cryptographic keys, which consist of both public and private keys, by yourself. This independence offers maximum control and decentralization, but at the cost of constant uptime and technical expertise.\n\nFailing to properly set up the validator node, secure its keys, understand the Ethereum network's protocols, and propose or vote on a block on time could result in loss of funds and prove challenging for users with non-technical backgrounds and busy schedules.\n\nThe average frequency of proposing a block is approximately once every 45 minutes, and the average frequency of voting on a block is approximately once every 45 seconds. These frequencies are estimated using probability calculations associated with validator selection.\n\nThe probability of being chosen to propose a block equals the validator's stake divided by the total amount of ETH staked by all validators on the network. A validator with 32 ETH staked would have a probability of approximately 0.0001024 of being chosen to propose a block in each slot.\n\nThe probability of being chosen to vote on a block equals the validator's stake divided by the total amount of ETH staked by all validators participating in the current epoch. An epoch is a fixed period of time in which validators are assigned to committees. A validator with 32 ETH staked would have a probability of approximately 0.0006075 of being chosen to vote on a block in each slot.\n\n\n\nStaking-as-a-Service\n\nStaking-as-a-service is when you delegate your staking rights to a third-party service provider who manages the validator node and staking process on your behalf, such as a crypto exchange or wallet. Pooled staking similarly involves delegating your ETH to a group of validators who are responsible for running the nodes, but you combine your ETH with other stakers to pool resources and share rewards.\n\n\n\nStaking-as-a-service and pooled staking are less technical options that don't require setting up a validator node and managing keys. Still, they involve surrendering some control, introducing counterparty risk, and potentially sharing personally identifying information (PII) with the service provider. You may need to provide your full legal name, date of birth, government-issued identification, physical address, email address, and phone number to comply with Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures.\n\nA number of crypto wallets and exchanges support staking-as-a-service and pooled staking. Centralized crypto exchanges offering native ETH staking include Coinbase, MetaMask, and Kraken. Decentralized crypto exchanges include Lido Finance, Rocket Pool, and StakerDAO. Crypto wallets comprise hot wallets and cold wallets and include many of the brands running top exchanges, Ledger, Trezor, and KeepKey. Once you have a wallet or an exchange account, you can transfer ETH to it to start staking.\n\n\n\nBenefits of Ethereum Staking\n\nEthereum staking allows you to passively earn income on your ETH holdings simply by locking up your existing ether cryptocurrency. These rewards are distributed periodically and have the potential to appreciate if the ETH's price goes up. The amount of rewards depends on the amount of ETH you stake, the length of time you stake it, and the overall staking activity on the network.\n\nEthereum staking gives you the right to participate in network governance decisions and strengthens the network's security by incentivizing validators to act responsibly and honestly. Validators can vote on proposed changes to the protocol, such as upgrades or new features. A participatory model ensures that the Ethereum network remains responsive to the needs of its users and stakeholders.\n\nEthereum staking contributes to the network's scalability and environmental friendliness by replacing energy-intensive computer mining with the less resource-demanding process of human validation. PoS eliminates PoW's need for massive amounts of electricity and specialized mining hardware, which is difficult to reuse or recycle at the end of its life cycle.\n\nStaking lowers the barrier to entry for participating in the Ethereum network's consensus process. Unlike mining, which required specialized hardware and technical expertise, staking can be done by anyone with an Ethereum wallet and a small amount of ETH tokens. Ethereum staking promotes decentralization and democratizes participation in network governance.\n\nThe estimated annual percentage rate (APR) for ETH staking, as of November 2023, is around 3.9% and calculated using a mathematical formula.\n\nRisks of Ethereum Staking\n\nStaking ETH comes with potential volatility, illiquidity, technical issues, and financial penalties. The price of ETH could drop or the validator could stop working as intended due to malfunctions, errors, and hacks, causing you to lose some of your investment. Your staked ETH will be locked up for the duration of the staking period, and you will not be able to access it during that time. Your staked ETH could be fined or slashed if you don't vote, go offline, or behave maliciously.\n\nIn the Ethereum network, validators who miss head, source, and target voting deadlines face penalties equal to the rewards they would have received had they submitted their votes. Head, source, and target votes are crucial aspects of the PoS consensus mechanism and play a significant role in approving new blocks in the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHead vote : A validator's attestation on the most recent block they believe to be the tip of the chain. This vote signifies the validator's agreement with the current state of the blockchain. By casting a head vote, validators finalize the most recent blocks, making them irreversible.\n\n: A validator's attestation on the most recent block they believe to be the tip of the chain.

Source vote : A validator's attestation of the most recent justified checkpoint of the chain. A checkpoint is a snapshot of the blockchain at a specific point in time. Justified checkpoints represent blocks that have been sufficiently finalized and are unlikely to be reverted. Source votes help establish that checkpoints are justified.\n\n: A validator's attestation of the most recent justified checkpoint of the chain.

Source votes help establish that checkpoints are justified. Target vote: A validator's attestation on the first block of the current epoch. An epoch is a fixed period of time in which validators are assigned to committees. Target votes help to ensure that all validators are on the same page regarding the start of the current epoch.\n\nSlashing is a severe penalty in which a validator is removed altogether from the Ethereum network and loses their staked ETH. Slashing can occur when a validator behaves maliciously by proposing and signing two different blocks for the same slot, attesting to a block that surrounds another block, or double voting for two candidates for the same block.\n\nProposing and signing two different blocks for the same slot : The act of a validator submitting two conflicting block proposals for the same slot in the chain. This behavior creates a fork in the chain, jeopardizing the network's consensus and potentially leading to double spending attacks.\n\n: The act of a validator submitting two conflicting block proposals for the same slot in the chain.

Double voting by attesting to two candidates for the same block: The act of a validator attesting to two different validators as the proposers of the same block. This behavior creates ambiguity regarding the block's proposer and could undermine the network's consensus mechanism.\n\n\n\nWhen a validator is slashed, 1/32 of their staked ETH is immediately burned, permanently destroying it from the Ethereum network, while a 36-day removal period gradually removes their remaining staked ETH. The dual penalty structure of slashing is designed to punish the validator for misbehavior, deter others from doing the same, and prevent the validator from immediately rejoining the network and continuing to cause problems.\n\nHalfway through the removal period, an additional penalty, the \"correlation penalty,\" is applied. The correlation penalty is designed to discourage validators from colluding to slash each other. The magnitude of the correlation penalty scales upward with the total staked ETH of all slashed validators in the 36 days prior to the slashing event.\n\n\n\nFactors to Consider When Choosing a Staking Method\n\nDeposit requirements, staking fees, coding ability, service provider quality, hardware costs, and cybersecurity are important when choosing how and where to stake Ethereum. We discuss some of these factors below.\n\nDeposit Requirements : Minimum deposit requirements influence the flexibility of staking strategies. Higher minimum deposits may require longer staking periods to break even and take away capital from an investment portfolio. Lower minimum deposits may encourage shorter staking periods and free up capital allocations for other investment areas.\n\n: Minimum deposit requirements influence the flexibility of staking strategies.

Quality Assurance : A high-quality wallet or exchange with a strong track record of software engineering and product development can provide added security and peace of mind when staking, especially if you are locking up a huge amount of ETH. Larger companies tend to have stronger talent and standards than smaller upstarts that run staking services.\n\n: A high-quality wallet or exchange with a strong track record of software engineering and product development can provide added security and peace of mind when staking, especially if you are locking up a huge amount of ETH.

While some aspects of the setup can be done through graphical user interfaces, some steps require command-line interactions and familiarity with coding concepts. Hardware Costs: For solo staking, you must purchase and maintain specialized hardware, such as a validator node. The upfront hardware cost and ongoing maintenance can be significant, ranging in the thousands of dollars.\n\nStaking Independently\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps to run an Ethereum validator node on your own:\n\nPurchase the hardware. Consistently reliable hardware for solo staking typically includes a powerful computer with a high-performance CPU such as an Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7, ample RAM of 32GB or more to support the demanding staking software, sufficient storage of at least 2TB SSD to store the entire Ethereum blockchain, and a stable Internet connection with high bandwidth and low latency. Install the necessary software. The software for Ethereum staking includes the Ethereum client, validator client, and any additional tools, typically involves downloading and compiling the software from source code or using package managers like apt or yum. This requires some familiarity with command-line environments and basic Linux/Unix commands. Configure the validator node. Edit the node's configuration files, set up its network settings, and generate its cryptographic keys. This requires understanding the structure of configuration files, syntax of specific commands, and the usage of tools like \"geth\" and \"geth attach\" for interacting with the Ethereum network. Monitor and maintain the validator node. Check logs, update software, troubleshoot issues, and ensure consistent uptime. This requires familiarity with log analysis tools, understanding error messages, and applying software updates through command-line tools or package managers.\n\nStaking Via Cryptocurrency Exchanges\n\nHere are the steps to stake Ethereum via a crypto exchange:"

        "title": "Ethereum ETF: How BlackRock's Proposal Affects Crypto's Outlook - U.S News & World Report Money",
        "content": "At $9.4 trillion in assets under management, U.S. investment behemoth BlackRock Inc. (ticker: BLK) is the largest money manager in the world.\n\nJust about all of that money percolates in traditional financial market channels, like stock, bonds, funds, currencies, derivatives, real estate and commodities. For years, nary a word was spoken (to the masses, at least) about BlackRock steering mountains of cash into cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nBut if you look closely, hints have been dropped about the investment firm's rising interest in crypto in the past few years.\n\nA case in point: In November 2020, Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, said Bitcoin had the potential to \"take the place of gold to a large extent.\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has also weighed in on crypto, noting that original crypto Bitcoin (BTC) was resonating with the public and may one day create its own global market. In December 2020, BlackRock left another crypto clue, advertising for a vice president of blockchain who would ostensibly drive \"strategies designed to drive demand for the firm's offerings.\"\n\nBlackRock's Bid for a Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nBlackRock announced in November 2023 that it filed for a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund, and with that action the company's cryptocurrency vision has begun to crystalize. After all, it wouldn't roll out a new crypto ETF if it didn't believe in the market where it operates, would it?\n\nBlackRock is not the only horse in the race for the first spot Ethereum ETF, however. Asset manager Grayscale Investments, which recently won a landmark legal victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its bid to move a spot Bitcoin ETF into fruition, is also pursuing a spot Ethereum ETF. On Dec. 5, the SEC gave itself an extension to reach a decision or extend the deadline for the ETH ETF until January 2024.\n\nBlackRock filed for its iShares Ethereum Trust to be listed on the Nasdaq and proposes to turn it into a spot ETF. Days later, Fidelity put in its own application for a spot Ethereum ETF, and at least five other top investment houses are now also in the running.\n\nThe SEC has yet to give the nod to either a spot Bitcoin or a spot Ethereum ETF, which would directly own Bitcoin and Ether rather than futures tied to the cryptos. There are several popular ETFs already in existence linked to cryptocurrency futures.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Appears Poised for Approval\n\nBlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF application is also in the works, as are talks between the SEC, Grayscale, Fidelity and others that have filed spot Bitcoin ETFs and progressed into a discussion of technical details, an indication that they may soon be approved, according to a Dec. 7 Reuters report.\n\nWhat's not as clear is what these high-profile entries into the market mean for cryptocurrency investors, prices, and public policy risk and regulation oversight.\n\nIndustry investment experts say that it should mean a shot in the arm for crypto in the short term \u2013 and maybe a lot more.\n\n\"Companies like BlackRock recognize the potential for market growth and the opportunity to profit from it,\" says Adam Berker, senior legal counsel at global payments platform Mercuryo. \"Consequently, they aim to be the first to penetrate the market and secure an advantage. Moreover, they already possess the necessary infrastructure, funds and investors to succeed and influence the further development of the crypto industry, given their heavy weight in the financial industry.\"\n\nEven more significantly, BlackRock's Ethereum ETF move could be seen as a new phase in the crypto industry's evolution. \"Large institutional investment funds are entering the market, prepared to invest their clients' money and influence the market's direction,\" Berker says.\n\n\"The foray of institutional giants like BlackRock into the crypto market signifies the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies as an asset class,\" says Nic Puckrin, CEO and co-founder of Coin Bureau, a cryptocurrency education platform. \"This strategic interest from large capital allocators signals a positive endorsement of the crypto industry, highlighting its growing acceptance and recognizing its potential for traditional hedge funds and investors.\"\n\n\n\nHow Would a Spot Ethereum ETF Impact Markets?\n\nWho benefits the most and who absorbs the largest risk regarding BlackRock's proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF? While nothing is guaranteed in the often-volatile cryptocurrency market, here's an \"impact\" list:\n\nImplications for the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nCrypto industry experts say BlackRock's potential introduction of a spot Ethereum ETF should drive the market forward significantly. BlackRock and Fidelity applying for spot crypto ETFs, as opposed to crypto futures ETFs, sends a message to the financial world that cryptocurrencies as an investment vehicle have matured to the point that established institutions feel comfortable diving in.\n\nIf a BlackRock or Fidelity spot crypto ETF rolls out, the floodgates could open, allowing billions of dollars of new capital to have access to this uncorrelated asset class. So, in short, prices could go up.\n\nEffect on Cryptocurrency Risk\n\nWhile it's no secret that cryptocurrency is volatile, having the BlackRock brand and other big names in the crypto market should provide some price stability, experts say, as the relatively small pool of crypto owners expands to give access to more people.\n\nIn the case of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF, for example, Galaxy Research estimates that the addressable market size would be roughly $14 trillion in the first year after its launch, reaching $39 trillion by its third year. That's a lot more crypto investors having a much bigger hand in the direction of assets.\n\nImpact on Cryptocurrency Prices\n\nCrypto experts generally view the BlackRock ETF play as a positive one across the board, price-wise.\n\n\"We can expect major cryptocurrency prices to spike in the short term,\" says Habeeb Syed, an associate attorney at Sutter Law PC, which regularly services blockchain clients. \"Medium to long term, expect sustained increases in BTC and ETH with the normal consequential rises in other crypto as the market sees an influx of value based on the two major cryptocurrencies.\"\n\nThat rise has already started, as Bitcoin's price popped above $44,000 late last week, and retreated just below $42,000 as of the morning of Dec. 11.\n\nOther professional cryptocurrency trackers concur, noting the \"trust\" issue leans toward the market with a BlackRock presence.\n\n\"Although we don't like to speculate on price action, we do believe that the crypto ETFs will have a positive impact on the industry and market overall,\" says Nathan Leung, a crypto educator and lead content creator at Cryptonauts, a YouTube platform that covers blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\n\nA stable level of trust from retail investors is extremely important because they are the key to mass adoption, Leung notes.\n\n\"Everyone has heard of crypto at this point, including your aunt and grandmother at family gatherings,\" he says. \"But their perception of crypto varies, and the sentiment is mostly negative surrounding our industry. An ETF approval would boost the level of trust immensely, having a domino effect on the rest of the market.\"\n\nWhat Risk Is BlackRock Taking With a Spot Ethereum ETF?\n\nThe biggest risk BlackRock faces is their ETF investors thinking they can stomach a 50% drawdown but then getting squeamish and pulling out at the bottom, causing negative sentiment toward BlackRock and the asset class as a whole, experts say.\n\nHowever, BlackRock entering the fold may mark a level of maturity for the industry, limiting future drawdowns to normal percentages akin to real estate investment trusts and small-cap stocks.\n\nWhat a Spot Ethereum ETF Means for the Second-Largest Crypto\n\nOften languishing in the shadow of Bitcoin, Ethereum could find its time to shine, but there are caveats.\n\n\"Ethereum is just the next big thing after Bitcoin and one of the assets in the space least likely to be classified as a security given its decentralized nature and active and widespread use,\" Syed says. \"If you're putting in the time and money to start an ETF, you don't want those efforts wiped out by a surprise SEC ruling.\"\n\nYet, with a green light from regulators, Ethereum could significantly benefit from its Fidelity or BlackRock ETF connection.\n\n\"Ethereum, the second-largest and most widely recognized cryptocurrency following Bitcoin, presents a valuable platform for BlackRock to enter this market,\" Berker says. \"Beyond its recognition, Ethereum provides substantial liquidity.\"\n\nThat means investment funds can purchase Ether in advance to establish a liquid reserve. \"When they decide to act, this reserve guarantees a robust market for transactions, offering an advantage over other altcoins,\" Berker notes.\n\nImpact of Spot Crypto ETFs on Everyday Investors\n\nBig moves from big investment firms have a ripple effect on Main Street investors, and BlackRock's new Ethereum ETF should be no different.\n\nAs with any investment, retail investors should keep a cool head if a spot Bitcoin or Ethereum ETF goes live. \"While the news about ETF approval will positively affect the development of the crypto market, it is also vital to consider the progression and continuity of such news,\" Berker says.\n\nMany investors will understandably assume that after a spot ETF has been approved, the price will be going up. But that's not necessarily the case."

        "title": "Ethereum faces a moment of truth with latest crypto rally - Fortune",
        "content": "In early December, the sudden popularity of a new species of NFT called Buterin Cards led Ethereum gas fees\u2014the cost to carry out a transaction on the blockchain\u2014to briefly soar to around $10. Even though the fees soon fell back to around $1, the episode was an unpleasant reminder of earlier crypto booms when Ethereum became practically unusable just as it was soaring in popularity. This famously occurred with the arrival of an early NFT package known as Crypto Kitties in 2017, and with the massive speculative frenzy of the 2021 crypto bubble.\n\nDuring those earlier episodes, Ethereum boosters begged for understanding since the blockchain, which was the first to popularize smart contracts, was still a new technology. The crypto world was largely understanding since growing pains for a project of this scale are inevitable, and due to the specific challenge of the \u201cblockchain trilemma\u201d\u2014an axiom that says it is easy to build for two of the three qualities of speed, security, and decentralization but not all three. As we appear to be entering a new crypto bull market, though, it\u2019s not clear if people will be as patient.\n\nThe frustration around gas fees is partly a financial one\u2014no one likes to pay more than they expect. But it\u2019s also rooted in a philosophical disconnect: The promise of Ethereum is that it\u2019s supposed to be a cheaper and safer technology than the conventional financial system. The reality for many people who first try Ethereum, however, is that the proposed gas cost exceeds the cost of the underlying transaction.\n\nI asked Paul Brody, an Ernst & Young executive who has written a well-reviewed book titled Ethereum for Business, to see if he is concerned that the blockchain\u2019s ongoing gas headaches might mean it is running out of time to prove it is ready for primetime. He told me he is not, pointing to the flourishing layer-2 ecosystem, which lets users carry out the bulk of transactions on auxiliary blockchains like Optimism at a fraction of the cost. Those transactions are then bundled up and stamped on the main Ethereum blockchain, providing the same immutable record.\n\nLayer-2 technology has indeed grown by leaps and bounds since 2021, spurred in part by Ethereum\u2019s successful switch to a proof-of-stake model for its blockchain, and costs on the side chains are far lower. But as I pointed to Brody, the experience of using a layer-2 chain is still clumsy and complicated, and off-putting to nontechnical people.\n\nBrody acknowledged that the L2 experience remains \u201cabsolutely horrible\u201d but says this is only a temporary situation, and that it won\u2019t be long until it becomes abstracted away with better designs. Meanwhile, he added that Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract for companies by an order of magnitude, and that this growth will only continue\u2014a refutation of claims by Solana and other rivals that tout their lower gas costs as proof they can replace Ethereum.\n\nFor now, Brody appears right that Ethereum remains in the pole position when it comes to being the world\u2019s go-to smart contract platform. That said, if the next crypto boom is once again defined by eye-popping Ethereum fees, patience will begin to run out.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe SEC asked a Washington, D.C., court to incorporate admissions included in Binance's recent settlement with the DOJ, claiming they strengthen its ongoing case.

        "title": "Ethereum staking network SSV launches permissionless mainnet - The Block",
        "content": "SSV -2.27% Network, an Ethereum staking infrastructure provider, has released its permissionless mainnet, becoming the first project to achieve this milestone using \"distributed validator technology\" or DVT.\n\nDVT enables Ethereum validators to share responsibilities with multiple parties, preventing single points of failure and improving overall resilience. With SSV Network's permissionless launch, anyone will be able to stake and contribute to the overall health of Ethereum, the project said.\n\n\"SSV is the first DVT network to go permissionless,\" Alon Muroch, core team founder of SSV Network, told The Block. \"DVT has the potential to make Ethereum much more secure and safe, solving major challenges like decentralization and censorship resistance.\"\n\nThe current Ethereum staking scenario raises centralization concerns, with a few major staking service providers holding substantial control over the process. Lido and Coinbase alone, for instance, control 46% of Ethereum staking market share. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also expressed concerns about the concentration of Ethereum's staking providers and has listed distributed validators among the blockchain's top priorities since at least 2021.\n\nLido has been in talks with SSV Network to enhance the decentralization of its operations. \"We are in our third testing round with Lido and expect to hit mainnet with Lido in the first quarter of next year,\" Muroch said. When asked if SSV is also in talks with Coinbase and other centralized exchanges such as Binance and Kraken, Muroch said he can't comment on that, but SSV is discussing DVT \"with everyone.\"\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nSSV token rewards\n\nSSV DAO aims to boost the adoption of its DVT network by offering token rewards. The DAO recently approved a year-long incentivization program, allocating 1 million SSV tokens (currently valued at around $24 million) to reward users for registering validators on the network. Users can stake directly on SSV Network or utilize staking services that have integrated SSV's infrastructure. \"This also means that node operators running on other protocols can double up on rewards by also operating on SSV.Network,\" the project said.\n\nIt took three years of development for SSV Network to launch its permissionless mainnet. SSV Network launched its partner mainnet in September, and since then, nearly $160 million worth of ether has been staked through SSV.\n\nOther Ethereum staking infrastructure projects that utilize the DVT approach are Obol and Diva. Earlier this month, Obol launched its mainnet open beta, while Diva released its operator testnet in September."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Drop As Traders Get Liquidated -- Is The Market Headed For a Reversal? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nOver $400 million worth of positions liquidated in the last 24 hours across BTC and ETH.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum decreased by 11% as key resistance was reached.\n\nA Bull market correction might have started.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin reached $45,000 on December 5 and stayed there until yesterday, December 10, when it made a downturn. It fell to $40,335 at its lowest point as the week began, marking a decrease of 11%. On the other hand, Ethereum made its yearly high of $2,400 on December 9 after a downturn to $2,145, which is an 11% decrease as well.\n\nConsequently, we saw a larger amount of long positions getting liquidated. According to CoinGlass data, in the past 24 hours, 113,881 traders were liquidated, and the total liquidations came in at $403.96 million.\n\nMost were long positions with $348.62 million compared to only $55.52 million. With the prices getting overextended in the previous period and now seeing significant declines, is this an early sign of market weakness?\n\nBTC Price Analysis\n\nThe price of Bitcoin rose by 76% since its September 11 low of around $25,000. This is the start of the ending wave from the larger uptrend that started on November 21 last year.\n\nIn our previous analysis, we called for an interaction with the $45,000 area as the next significant resistance, and judging by today\u2019s rejection, it has proven to serve as such. Analyzing the wave structure in the last advancement from November 6, it seems there might be another minor attempt to continue its upward trajectory.\n\nIt came slightly short from the interaction with the level, so an upward spike above it would look likely, but it ended as a wick and quickly snapped back below it. The rise ended as it is, and now the first bull phase correction has started.\n\nIn any case, this correction will be awaited shortly, and from the current downward movement, we will see if it has already begun. This ABC correction should bring the price of Bitcoin to the $25,000 area optimally but could go lower.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nWhat\u2019s been said for Bitcoin applies to Ethereum as well. Its price was in an ascending structure from June 18 last year and most likely marked the completion of the leading diagonal, moving upward in a five-wave manner.\n\nDecember 9 high was an interaction with its ascending resistance level and ended as a rejection, displaying the same behavior as it did on two previous occasions. There could be another minor high ahead, but this chance is slim.\n\nMore likely, we saw the completion of this larger uptrend, and it is now headed to its first bull-significant correction. If so, ETH could now be sent to the $1,500 area in an ABC correction or to $1,400 if it reaches its optimal Fibonacci retracement level of 0.618.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has continuously grown since November last year and recovered significantly, showing promising signs of a starting bull market. However, before it can continue sustainably, it must establish higher support and form its first higher low.\n\nThese higher lows are the corrections we have outlined in our price chart analysis and are referred to as higher price points compared to the lows of November last year when the larger uptrend started.\n\nAs the prices are getting overextended and we are approaching the holiday season, the euphoria might cause the market to continue or attempt to rise for another push, but these corrections are imminent.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / December 12, 2023 / DeFi Bitcoin (DBTC) is an emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) project. In the latest development, the company has raised the bar with the introduction of an innovative market cycle structure on the Ethereum blockchain. This development empowers the trading behavior and enhances project stability.\n\nDeFiBitcoin's unique Market Cycle Mastery structure operates on a weekly basis, comprising two distinct phases:\n\nBull Market (4 days): An upward price movement fostering market growth.\n\nBear Market (3 days): A phase characterized by downward price movement, allowing for corrections and adjustments.\n\nA pivotal halving event occurs between these markets, where half of the remaining supply is mined. This not only reduces the total reward pool of 5,250,000 BTC with each cycle but also increases the value of tokens. The tax remains at 0/0 in both market cycles, creating an environment conducive to healthy trading.\n\nWith the new developments, DeFiBitcoin places an emphasis on security, implementing a series of robust measures. To safeguard the integrity of the ecosystem, the developer's functionality is judiciously restricted, limiting actions to essential tasks such as adjusting tax rates, whitelisting wallets, distributing rewards, and minting supply for distribution.\n\nNotably, the supply minted during each halving event is hardcoded to the connected software, reinforcing the predictability and reliability of the platform. Furthermore, it has fortified user's security posture by renouncing the contract, a strategic move that adds an extra layer of protection, ensuring security even without relying on renounce-safe methods. These measures underscore the commitment to fostering a secure and resilient decentralized finance environment for community.\n\nIn tandem with market cycle, DeFiBitcoin has also developed the DeFi Bitcoin Bot - a smart companion specifically crafted for user convenience. Seamlessly integrating with the ecosystem, this intelligent bot aims to enhance the trading experience. Users can effortlessly navigate the DeFi Bitcoin Bot using simple commands like /status and /reward. These commands empower users to swiftly verify their wallet eligibility for rewards and bonuses, whether in the official Telegram group or through direct messaging.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoving forward, the bot goes beyond mere confirmation, providing valuable insights such as eligibility notifications based on trading behavior, token analysis for maintaining reward qualifications, and trade suggestions for optimizing bonuses. Operating in real-time, the bot ensures users stay informed with the latest updates on eligibility status and potential rewards, accessible seamlessly across official Telegram channels and direct messaging. Experience the future of decentralized finance with the DeFi Bitcoin Bot -the intelligent ally in the world of crypto trading.\n\nWith its newly launched market cycle, DeFiBitcoin emerges as a pioneer in decentralized finance on the Ethereum blockchain. The secure contract and thoughtful design underscore the project's commitment to stability, controlled trading behavior, and long-term participant incentives.\n\nAbout the Company - DeFiBitcoin\n\nDeFiBitcoin is a decentralized finance project built on the Ethereum blockchain. With a focus on innovation and security, DeFiBitcoin introduces a unique market cycle structure and reward system to optimize trading behavior, ensure project stability, and reward participants.\n\nFor further details, potential clients visit the following link: https://defibitcointoken.com/\n\nMedia Details:\n\nCompany Name: DeFiBitcoin\n\nCompany's Website: https://defibitcointoken.com/\n\nstaff@defibitcointoken.com\n\nToken listing\n\nhttps://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xdc631bdcb5ad07d86643f6524de0fd8a33a00a9f\n\nSOURCE: DeFiBitcoin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Ethereum price took a major hit like Bitcoin and dropped over $350. ETH tested the $2,000 support and is currently attempting a fresh increase.\n\nEthereum declined over 8% and broke the $2,200 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $2,340 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise again unless there is a close below the $2,100 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Took A Major Hit\n\nEthereum price climbed further higher above the $2,300 level. ETH even cleared the $2,350 level but the bears remained active near the $2,400 zone. A high was formed near $2,401 and there was a sharp decline like Bitcoin.\n\nThe price declined over 8% and there was a move below the $2,200 level. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $2,340 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even spiked below the $2,000 support before the bulls appeared.\n\nA low was formed near $1,980 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $2,150 and $2,180 levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,401 swing high to the $1,980 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,275 zone. The next key resistance is near the $2,300 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,401 swing high to the $1,980 low. A clear move above the $2,300 zone could send the price toward the $2,400 level. The next resistance sits at $2,450. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,500 level.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,300 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,180 level.\n\nThe next key support is $2,120. The main support is now near $2,100. A downside break below $2,200 might start an extended decline. The key support is now at $2,000, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $1,880 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 30 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,100\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,300\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Analysis of Ethereum\u2019s recent financial data on Ultrasound Money reveals a continued shift in its economic model since the historic merge in Sept. 2022.\n\nThe decline in Ethereum\u2019s supply stands at 309,663 ETH, equivalent to approximately $686.2 million. This reduction reflects a deflationary trend, contrasting the previous inflationary nature where new ETH was consistently created. The cause of this shift can be traced to the burning of 1,195,238 ETH, valued at around $2.65 billion. Permanently removing tokens from circulation plays a crucial role in reducing the total supply and could enhance ETH\u2019s scarcity and value over time. Further, despite the issuance of 885,581 ETH, worth about $1.96 billion, Ethereum\u2019s total supply experienced a net decrease, illustrating that the rate of ETH burning continues to surpass the rate of new issuance.\n\nPresently, the total supply of Ethereum stands at the lowest point since the merge at 120,211,380 ETH, translating to a market capitalization of approximately $266.39 billion, reinforcing its significant standing in the crypto market.\n\nA look at the ETH burning leaderboard presents further insights by analyzing the leading contracts contributing to the burning of ETH. The top contributors to this activity include major dApps and services, notably Uniswap in its various iterations, Tether, and OpenSea. Uniswap\u2019s prominent position suggests a high transaction volume within the DeFi sector, with $543.8 million burned across four contracts in the top 10.\n\nThe presence of Tether indicates substantial stablecoin transactions on Ethereum\u2019s network, while OpenSea\u2019s inclusion highlights the enduring nature of NFT transactions even through the bear market. This diversity, encompassing DeFi platforms, stablecoins, NFT marketplaces, and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, showcases the multifaceted utilization of Ethereum.\n\nBurned ETH Entity Value (USD) 84,006.46 Uniswap Universal Router $186,158,315.36 75,926.77 Uniswap V2 $168,253,722.32 74,739.31 ETH transfers $165,622,310.96 58,030.71 Uniswap Universal Router 2 $128,596,053.36 53,626.72 Tether $118,836,811.52 27,441.92 Uniswap V3 $60,811,294.72 26,935.76 New contracts $59,689,644.16 23,405.50 OpenSea $51,866,588.00 22,891.92 Arbitrum $50,728,494.72 22,201.66 MetaMask $49,198,878.56\n\nSource: ultrasound.money\n\nThe top 10 contracts total $1,039,762,113.68 worth of ETH burned, just under half of the total burn since the merge.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a deflationary model may continue to attract investors seeking a store of value, especially when contrasted with inflationary fiat currencies. The heightened activity in decentralized exchanges and DeFi applications indicates a robust trend toward decentralized finance.\n\nInterestingly, under its current proof-of-stake (PoS) model, the Ethereum network has burned an average of 1.83 ETH/min since the merge. However, since the burn mechanic was implemented as part of the EIP-1559 upgrade in Aug. 2021, the average burn rate is almost double, 3.09 ETH/min. Yet, due to the drastic reduction in supply issuance since proof-of-work mining was removed, the total supply has steadily declined.\n\nIf Ethereum had retained its PoW mode, the supply would have reached a mammoth 124,941,176 ETH, some 4.7 million ETH more than the current level. Theoretically, at the current price of $2,228, this would have given Ethereum a market cap of $12 billion higher than current $266 billion. Importantly, due to the increased supply, this is merely academic due to the nature of supply/demand market dynamics.\n\nLooking ahead, these dynamics may influence Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in various ways. Continued deflationary tendencies could lead to increased demand and potentially higher ETH prices, assuming steady or rising demand coming out of the bear market. However, it\u2019s essential to consider that market volatility and external factors like regulatory changes or macroeconomic trends can significantly impact these dynamics, especially with continued activity from the SEC in the U.S. toward categorizing PoS tokens as securities.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum\u2019s post-merge statistics signal a notable move towards a deflationary framework, underscored by high network usage, particularly in the DeFi and NFT sectors, and the potential for heightened value due to diminishing supply. However, these trends warrant continued analysis and understanding of macroeconomic factors to comprehend their long-term impact and sustainability fully."

        "content": "Today SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) announced it has tokenized the shares of a private company Aktionariat AG in its blockchain-based central securities depository (CSD). The tokenized shares had already been issued on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point?\n\nWhile tokenizing securities should improve liquidity, today that\u2019s often not the case. Part of the issue is the fragmentation of investor pools. You have crypto-savvy investors who are comfortable investing in public blockchain tokens. And you have institutions where sometimes that\u2019s not the case.\n\nBy tokenizing the stocks in a central securities depository, you can have the best of both worlds. Crypto-savvy investors can buy the stocks directly on Ethereum. And institutional investors and brokers can can access the stock via a CSD, in a similar way to how they usually access stocks and other securities.\n\nBerner Kantonalbank (BEKB) acted as the issuer agent and custodian. Aktionariat was eating its own dog food, given its business is helping companies to tokenize their stocks.\n\n\u201cWith this transaction, the involved players from the traditional finance world are proving that they are open to the integration of assets that were originally issued on an open, permissionless blockchain,\u201d said Nicola Plain, CEO of Aktionariat. \u201cAn important step towards building a bridge between decentralized finance and traditional finance.\u201d\n\nThis particular transaction was more of a pilot. The three companies now plan to explore commercializing the concept.\n\nIt also aligns with SDX\u2019s strategy to engage with private market ecosystem partners and the Swiss SME investor community,\u201d said Alexandre Kech, Head Digital Securities at SDX.\n\nMulti blockchain tokens \u2013 some takeaways\n\nThis sort of solution raises a few questions. If the two records got out of sync, which one would be legally valid? We\u2019re assuming the CSD but it\u2019s a question worth asking.\n\nIt leads to another issue we\u2019ve raised before. Companies generally have one system where they record their capitalization table. So far, most securities issuances have been on a single blockchain. But that is unlikely to be the case in the future. We\u2019re not talking about this example, where in theory the same issuances are mirrored.\n\nConsider stablecoin issuers such as Tether and Circle. They issue stablecoins on several public blockchains. Stock issuers might choose to do likewise. Franklin Templeton has launched its government money market fund on multiple blockchains. The Franklin Templeton case is a little different because the U.S. SEC requires a separate traditional database as the definitive record.\n\nMeanwhile, Korea\u2019s CSD is building a solution to support multiple blockchain security token issuance.\n\nAlso when you start involving the regulatory sector, there\u2019s a good chance that banks could hold the stocks on their balance sheet. That triggers the Basel banking rules. The Basel Committee is not too keen on public blockchain and seems to want to treat tokenized public blockchain securities like crypto. Given in this SDX case there is a CSD, would they be treated as public blockchain? If the CSD is the definitive record, does it matter that they are also issued on a public blockchain?\n\nOver time these sorts of issues will become clearer."

        "title": "Ethereum Tests Crucial Support As $6.6 Million Liquidated Near $2,250! Will ETH Price Decline Again? - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum continue to experience price drops in recent hours, marking a bearish start to the week. While this could be a standard correction ahead of a bull run, similar to patterns observed in past bull markets, there is growing worry about whale investors selling for profit, potentially postponing the anticipated bull phase. Ethereum, in particular, is facing increased liquidations and is approaching a critical support level to test.\n\nETH Price Prepares To Test $2,100\n\nAccording to Coinglass, there has been a significant increase in the liquidation of long positions as the price of Ethereum fell sharply from $2,250. In the past three hours alone, long positions valued at over $6.6 million were liquidated as investor confidence declined following the drop from $2,250. In the same vein, Bitcoin also experienced over $15 million in long position liquidations, indicating an ongoing sell-off and the potential for further price declines.\n\nInterest from whale investors in Ethereum has declined, with large-scale transactions reaching a one-month low. IntoTheBlock reports a sharp decrease in the number of large transactions, following the downturn in Ethereum\u2019s price. Currently, this metric stands at around 2.65K transactions.\n\nInterestingly, as Ethereum\u2019s price drops, some investors see this as an opportune moment to increase their holdings. Data from CryptoQuant shows that Ethereum\u2019s Netflow is negative, indicating that the outflow of coins from exchanges is exceeding the inflow. This trend suggests that despite the falling prices, exchange reserves of Ethereum are declining as investors withdraw their ETH to start holding from the recent dip.\n\nThis trend could notably strengthen the immediate support levels as Ethereum\u2019s price approaches a test of the $2100 mark. At present, the market sentiment is largely bearish, as indicated by the long/short ratio standing at 0.8692. This shows that 53.5% of positions are anticipating a decrease in price. On the other hand, 46.5% of positions remain bullish, maintaining a bullish outlook despite the increasing selling pressure.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nThere is an attempt by bearish traders to push Ethereum\u2019s price below the critical breakout level of $2,200, but the bullish investors are defending this level. This indicates an effort by buyers to establish $2,200 as a new support level.\n\nThe ETH price is flashing extreme volatility near $2.2K as buyers attempt to send the price above EMA20. To regain positions, ETH price needs to hold within $2,400 and break above the resistance at $2,464. However, sellers are expected to defend this level aggressively.\n\nThe key support zone to watch is between $2,200 and $2,100. A decline below this support zone could trap some of the more aggressive bullish traders, potentially leading to a wave of long position liquidations. Such a scenario could trigger a sharp correction, possibly driving the price down toward $1,900."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) just experienced its greatest price wick in nearly two years, destroying millions of open positions. This rapid price movement resulted in a staggering $82 million worth of long position liquidations, marking it as one of the most wild moves on the market since the onset of the bull run.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe price chart of Ethereum displays a stark long wick dipping down, an uncommon sight that indicates a violent shift in price over a very short period. This wick represents a severe, rapid price drop followed by an equally swift recovery, which often leads to a significant number of traders being caught off guard, with their positions liquidated as the market rapidly moves against them.\n\nSo, what led to this dramatic market movement?\n\nFirst, a liquidity crunch can precipitate such a situation. In a market where many traders are positioned on the long side, a sudden drive to sell can trigger a cascade of liquidations due to a lack of immediate buy orders at current or slightly lower levels, causing the price to plummet until it hits a level where liquidity is available.\n\nSecond, a long squeeze may occur when the market is heavily biased toward long positions. If the market begins to turn, those with leveraged long positions may be forced to sell to cover their positions, thus amplifying the downward price pressure.\n\nThe unexpected nature of this wick caught thousands of traders by surprise, resulting in massive losses for those with leveraged positions. However, the aftermath of the wick saw a spike in buying power, indicating that many investors saw this as a buying opportunity, thereby pushing the price back to a relatively stable zone.\n\nEthereum is known for its volatility, but a wick of this magnitude is a rare occurrence even for a cryptocurrency market. Investors might consider staying less leveraged in order to safeguard themselves from such dramatic swings."

        "content": "Ethereum price prediction: The crypto market rallied significantly last week amid growing anticipation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. However, the week culminated in widespread declines led by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe two most prominent cryptos continued with their retreat on Monday with Ethereum price falling by 6% to $2,215 and Bitcoin price sliding by 5% to $41,796.\n\nadvertisement\n\nCumulatively, the market cap is down to $1.63 trillion. Ethereum accounts for 16.3% of the crypto market while Bitcoin dominance holds at 50.1%.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Will Holders Buy The Dip?\n\nEthereum is in danger of falling below the current support at $2,200, especially if the sell-off across the market continues throughout the US session. There\u2019s a chance the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (blue) will reduce the intensity of the downtrend and trigger a buy-the-dip spree.\n\nHowever, this outlook may fail to materialize based on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator and the potential sell signal.\n\nTraders considering shorting ETH price may want to confirm that the blue MACD line is below the red signal line and the indicator is generally sloping downwards.\n\nThe next key support lies at $2,100 but if the selling pressure overwhelms the bulls, traders would be forced to push the nearest support area to $2,000. Trading below this level could cause panic selling as holders rush to protect the gains they have accumulated over the last two months.\n\nInvestors are likely to be sitting on the edge and preparing to buy the dip if Ethereum price upholds support either at $2,100 or $2,000.\n\nEthereum is approaching oversold levels in shorter time frames, as shown by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) applied to the four-hour chart. Two scenarios may play out based on the RSI\u2019s position and available support areas.\n\nIf support at $2,200 holds and Ethereum price begins to rise, the RSI will also start moving up in the neutral area, suggesting the brief correction is over and a recovery is due.\n\nOn the other hand, if the RSI continues with the downward trend into the oversold region, Ethereum price will be forced to lose more ground and possibly touch $2,000 before rebounding.\n\nRecommended for you: Reasons Why Terra Classic Price (LUNC) Could Explode 38% This Week\n\nEthereum DeFi TVL Rally To $28 Billion\n\nThe total value locked (TVL), which measures the amount of Ethereum locked across the Ethereum decentralized finance (DeFi) has increased to $28 billion from $26.7 billion on December 1, according to data by Defi Llama.\n\nAn increasing TVL suggests that holders have a long-term bullish outlook for Ethereum and are not bothered by short-term price movements. It also reduces the circulating supply, which subsequently lowers the potential selling pressure, thus setting up Ethereum price for a rally.\n\nRelated Articles"

        "content": "SSV.Network Introduces Permissionless DVT on Ethereum\n\nTel-Aviv, Israel --News Direct-- SSV\n\nEthereum Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) staking infrastructure SSV.Network has announced its permissionless launch. The milestone is a major breakthrough in creating a new standard for ETH staking by delivering greater security for Ethereum validators and strengthening the network by decentralizing its validation layer.\n\nThe permissionless launch is the product of three years of intensive development in making staking more accessible for all staking participants. The achievement unites the entire Ethereum staking ecosystem, which can benefit from the many uses that DVT allows. SSV Network breaks down entry barriers to Ethereum staking, offering a robust and permissionless infrastructure, enabling seamless building, staking, and zero-collateral node operations through one holistic solution.\n\nThe permissionless launch will enable public validators and node operators to join the network and participate in a first-of-its-kind DVT infrastructure. By going permissionless, anyone will be able to stake and contribute to the overall health of the Ethereum network. To celebrate the launch, the SSV Core Team will host an online event for those who want to learn more about the launch and how to join.\n\nTo support DVT adoption, the SSV DAO initiated a year-long incentivization program which has been earmarked for 1 million $SSV (Current market price - $25 million) and will reward users for registering validators to the network. This can be done by staking directly on SSV.Network or via staking services that embed the DVT infrastructure. This also means that node operators running on other protocols can double up on rewards by also operating on ssv.network.\n\nDVT helps decentralize ETH validators - and by extension, Ethereum as a whole - by increasing client diversity, location distribution, and extending infrastructure diversity, resulting in greater uptime and rewards. Its implementation through SSV.Network will strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem and allow seamless staking for diverse staking use cases.\n\nStory continues\n\nSSV.Network commenced gradual rollout in September 2023 with a selection of permissioned node operators. Having ensured network stability and conducting audits, a broader rollout followed, ensuring security and battle testing before becoming fully permissionless with various staking applications built on the infrastructure. From today, SSV\u2019s community-owned open protocol can be used by the entire Ethereum community to stake, build applications, and run an operator node that utilizes its framework.\n\nIn just over two months, more than $160M was staked through SSV.Network by 74 node operators. In addition, over 2,200 validators are now using SSV\u2019s DVT-based infrastructure. The permissionless launch of the SSV.Network mainnet will accelerate diverse node operators and TVL while establishing the protocol as the preeminent solution for Ethereum staking.\n\nAbout SSV.Network\n\nSSV.Network creates easy-to-use and scalable infrastructure for developers. SSV is powered by DVT technology, a pioneering architectural framework designed specifically for Ethereum staking. Thanks to its permissionless design, SSV empowers staking operators and validators to join the network and participate in Ethereum staking.\n\nContact Details\n\nSSV.Network\n\nRobert Drage\n\ninfo@ssv.network\n\nCompany Website\n\nhttps://ssv.network/\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/ssv-network-launches-permissionless-dvt-powered-ethereum-staking-778265295"

        "title": "NFTs Are Dead? Solana Outpaces Ethereum for NFT Sales - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nSolana has been a big beneficiary of the wider crypto resurgence recently.\n\nPrices have boomed since the middle of October across most high-profile digital assets.\n\nNow that Solana success looks to be translating into more NFT sales.\n\nIn a dramatic twist, the Solana (SOL) network briefly surpassed Ethereum (ETH) in total non-fungible token (NFT) sales volume on Friday, marking a notable, if temporary, shift in the market.\n\nFor seasoned crypto veterans, Ethereum dominating the NFT space seemed an immutable law of the industry. Yet Solana\u2019s surprise performance raises questions about Ethereum\u2019s place as the dominant smart contract and NFT platform.\n\nA Good Week for Solana NFTs\n\nSparked by skyrocketing sales from the \u201cTensorians\u201d NFT collection, Solana saw trading activity that catapulted it past Ethereum for the first time since June. Coming on the heels of Solana\u2019s 75% increase in total value locked in DeFi protocols last month, this achievement signals a network whose comeback is outperforming the wider crypto industry.\n\nAnd Solana isn\u2019t alone in this revival. The entire NFT industry appears poised for growth following the tremors that rocked the crypto world last year. According to DappRadar\u2019s November report, monthly NFT trading volumes just hit $994 million globally \u2013 a 125% surge from October. Driving this boom are Solana-based collections like Tensorians, BONKz and Mad Lads. As well as a significant uptick in Bitcoin Ordinals \u2013 BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.\n\nBut while the sales headlines are grabbing attention, data from DappRadar reveals a behavioral shift rumbling through the NFT market: increased buying, but at higher prices. The average transaction value recently doubled, suggesting traders feel buoyant bidding up works rather than chasing quantity.\n\nHowever, the NFT market is highly dependent on the health of digital assets elsewhere. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, is up approximately 56% since the middle of October, when the latest market rally began. SOL meanwhile, has pumped 209% in the same time. So, perhaps its no wonder Solana NFTs are having their moment in the sun.\n\nA Big Change from Pear Bear and Peak Bull Market\n\nThis flowering of NFT trade stands in stark contrast to the crypto winter of 2022 that left traders out in the cold. NFT sales hit a peak in January last year before crypto markets nosedived, triggering widespread panic in the long-term viability of non-fungible tokens.\n\nBut while the market is seeing a resurgence, it is in no way comparable to the halcyon days of 2021 and early 2022, when the price of non-fungible tokens commanded news attention outside the crypto space. In January 2022, the NFT market totaled a record-breaking $16 billion in sales, although 60% of it originated from artificial trading on LooksRare, according to DappRadar .\n\nSince the cooling-off, NFTs have largely lost their luster. Celebrities like Madonna and Justin Bieber, who once proudly wore their blue chip Bored Apes, now have little to say about the phenomenon, partly because of an ongoing legal case . By-and-large, NFT trading and collecting is still a very niche pursuit.\n\nThings could still change, however. 2023 has seen the crypto market make something of a resurgence. Optimists believe 2024 could do the same for NFTs."

        "title": "Ethereum scaling firm =nil; Foundation introduces security-focused zkEVM - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Zero-knowledge technology firm =nil; Foundation has developed a new type-1 zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) compiler to address security concerns identified in similar ZK-powered Ethereum scaling solutions.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Cointelegraph, =nil; Foundation CEO and co-founder Misha Komarov says the technology prioritizes security and allows high-level programming code to be compiled automatically into Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKS) circuits.\n\nThe firm\u2019s zkEVM is designed to be compatible with evmone, which is a C++ version of Ethereum\u2019s base execution environment. The key takeaway is that the code of applications is processed and rolled up as proofs submitted to Ethereum in the same format as its EVM.\n\nRelated: Ethereum L2 Starknet aims to decentralize core components of its scaling network\n\nThe compatibility is touted to ensure better security and quicker implementation, given that the bytecode is the same and removes the need for lengthy and expensive code audits. The approach also provides transactions and smart contracts directly compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nSeveral high-profile zkEVMs have come to market in 2023. These layer-2 protocols aim to help Ethereum process large transaction loads and smart contract functions. Cointelegraph has covered these at length, with companies like Consensys, Polygon, StarkWare and Matter Labs releasing ZK-rollup solutions to provide high throughput, low fee capabilities to decentralized applications, services and network users.\n\nRelated: Matter Labs steps back as zkSync launches ecosystem portal managed by DappRadar\n\nAs Komarov explains, =nil; Foundation\u2019s solution hinges on an automated compiler contrasting the design of other zkEVMs, which manually define circuits. He describes existing approaches as \u201ctime-intensive\u201d and \u201coverly complex,\u201d which also runs the risk of introducing human error.\n\nThese concerns were evident in discovering a soundness bug in the ZK-circuits used in Matter Labs\u2019 zkSync Era mainnet. Security firm ChainLight received a 50,000 USD Coin (USDC) reward from the firm for identifying the vulnerability in Sept. 2023.\n\nRelated: Polygon co-founder: $1B bet on ZK-rollups paying off\n\nThe bug would have allowed an attacker to produce proofs for invalidly executed blocks, which the smart contract verifier on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet would have accepted. Matter Labs deployed a fix and awarded ChainLight a bug bounty, the first claimed for a ZK-circuit bug in the zkSync Era.\n\n\u201cVitalik Buterin started talking about security concerns, like what if a circuit gets broken,\u201d Komarov explains.\n\n\u201cWe started digging into it. The problem became obvious that these circuits are written manually. People spent years building it, but it basically recreates the same logic that EVM does, manually in the circuit representation.\u201d\n\nKomarov adds that this method makes code auditing extremely hard. The zkSync bug is an example of the potential for error involved in manually defined circuits. =Nil; Foundation\u2019s approach is to automate the compiler from Ethereum\u2019s EVM using its circuit compiler developed over the past two years.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s as close as we can get for the circuit to have the same security as Ethereum's original implementation. If that\u2019s broken, then the circuit is broken.\u201d\n\nThe solution is also designed to be adaptable to EVM changes as Ethereum\u2019s roadmap continues, providing a \u201cfuture-proof\u201d zkEVM compiler that does not require significant resources and time to upgrade, given its automated design. This allows the zkEVM to integrate the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposals as they take effect.\n\nThe foundation published its prototype code repository and specifications on Dec. 12.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "content": "Ethereum price started a consolidation phase after a sharp decline. ETH must clear the $2,275 resistance to start a fresh increase in the near term.\n\nEthereum recovered losses after testing the $2,000 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2,250 and $2,275 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Eyes Fresh Increase\n\nEthereum price started a sharp decline below the $2,300 pivot level, like Bitcoin. ETH declined heavily below the $2,220 and $2,200 levels. Finally, it tested the $2,000 support before the bulls emerged.\n\nA low was formed near $1,980 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $2,120 and $2,150 resistance levels. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,400 swing high to the $1,980 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,250 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key resistance is near the $2,275 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,400 swing high to the $1,980 low. A clear move above the $2,300 zone could send the price toward the $2,400 level. The next resistance sits at $2,450. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,500 level.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,275 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,155 level.\n\nThe next key support is $2,120. The main support is now near $2,100. A downside break below $2,100 might start another major decline. In the stated case, Ether could revisit the $2,000 support. Any more losses might call for a test of the $1,880 support zone in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 30 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,155\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,275\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The Ethereum price has been among the worst hit in the flash crash that took place on Monday. The crash sent the asset\u2019s price down below $2,200 for the first time in the last week and has continued to trend low around this point. As the market shows a bit of recovery momentum, questions remain about what could have triggered the crash.\n\nEthereum Price Fell Because Whales Have Been Selling\n\nOne of the most obvious causes of the flash crash that affected the Ethereum price is the fact that large holders have been selling. This month, ETH hit its highest level in the last year and this sent a lot of investors back into profit. Now, since there has not been a complete bullish turnover of the crypto market, there are expectations that the market could crash and investors are trying to secure profits before this happens.\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez flagged the selling from these large holders in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday. According to him, these large holders had actually begun selling when the price had first crossed $2,300. This means that the selling pressure had been mounting for a while before being reflected in the price.\n\nThe whales who hold more than 10,000 ETH in their balances had been reducing their holdings toward the end of November. By December, their holdings had fallen to their lowest point in the last three months, showing proof of massive sell-offs by these whales.\n\nETH price at $2,242 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nUncertainty About Macro Factors\n\nMacroeconomic uncertainty has also played a role in the crypto crash that sent the Ethereum price to $2,200. One example of this is the CPI data release that is expected to take place on Tuesday. As investors eagerly await the results from the announcement, market fluctuations are expected.\n\nThe November inflation data is also expected to be released this week, as well as the Fed\u2019s decision and statement happening on Monday. Ahead of these events, high volatility is always expected as investors move to secure some of their positions.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum has begun to show some bullish momentum once more. It has since bounced from its lows of $2,170 and is back up above $2,000, where bulls are already providing a lot of support. If Bitcoin\u2019s price continues to rise, Ethereum could reclaim the $2,300 level before the day is over.\n\nThe price of ETH is sitting at $2,238 at the time of this writing, down 4.50% in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from Quora, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Nonfungible token (NFT) platform Enjin recently migrated over 200 million NFTs from Ethereum and a sidechain to its own Enjin Blockchain.\n\nIn an announcement received by Cointelegraph, Enjin noted that over 118 million NFTs hosted on Ethereum, along with over 101 million NFTs hosted in an Ethereum sidechain called JumpNet, have been transferred to its mainnet called the Enjin Blockchain.\n\nExample of NFTs migrated to the Enjin Blockchain. Source: Enjin\n\nIn June, the NFT platform announced the creation of its own blockchain. Enjin said the new network embedded NFT-focused features such as NFT transfers and royalty enforcement into the blockchain\u2019s foundational code.\n\nWith the transition, users will experience several changes, such as the built-in royalties and a new feature called \u201cFuel Tanks,\u201d which lets developers subsidize gas fees for users. According to the announcement, the platform will use this feature to give users free transactions across its ecosystem for three months.\n\nOn Dec. 6, executives working in the gaming industry weighed in on the future of blockchain gaming and highlighted several catalysts to Web3 adoption in gaming. Bartosz Skwarczek, the founder and CEO of G2A Capital Group, told Cointelegraph that improvements in accessibility and user interfaces would attract a broader gamer audience to Web3.\n\nSimilarly, Rene Stefancic, the chief operating officer of Atlas Development Services, a core contributor to the Enjin Blockchain, said that the push to a different blockchain could potentially allow Web3 to \u201ctap into the three billion-strong global gamer market.\u201d\n\nRelated: NFT trading volume nears $1B as markets turn bullish: Report\n\nOscar Franklin Tan, the chief financial officer of Atlas, told Cointelegraph that to avoid an \u201cincredible amount of gas fees\u201d for transferring over 200 million NFTs, the platform has taken a different approach with their migration. Tan said:\n\n\u201cTo avoid the incredible amount of gas fees for 200 million NFTs, instead of requiring users to burn the Ethereum NFTs before issuing Enjin Blockchain NFTs, which is how the normal migration would work, a snapshot was taken and users are allowed to sign with their Ethereum wallet to claim the Enjin Blockchain NFTs.\u201d\n\nTan explained that this process lets users claim without paying for gas. However, one potential drawback is that instead of the NFTs being burned in Ethereum, they will still exist on the previous networks. \u201cCreators have to ask holders not to trade them and consider the Enjin Blockchain versions the official versions,\u201d Tan added.\n\nMagazine: Web3 Gamer: Games need bots?

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin fell below $41,000 and Ethereum below $2,200 on Monday as crypto markets took a dive after having rallied for the better part of two months.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $40,758, down 7% in the past day. This is after the market already saw $330 million in crypto futures contracts liquidated on Monday morning as BTC fell below $43,000. Total liquidations have now reached $516 million, according to CoinGlass.\n\nStill, the 1-day dip is relative. It's still 5% higher than it was at the start of the month, when BTC was changing hands for $38,688. The same can be said of Ethereum, which has lost 7% since yesterday and is currently trading for $2,185. That's 7% higher than what it started the month at, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization, which has hovered around $1 trillion for the better part of the year, now sits at $1.6 trillion\u2014down 6% since yesterday.\n\nElsewhere in the market, alts were taking a beating. ORDI (ORDI), which last week saw explosive growth and set an all-time high of $68.37, has slumped 14% in the past day. The token, easily the most popular BRC-20 token built on Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals protocol, is now trading for $45.11.\n\nPepecoin (PEPE), which last week jumped 26% during a spike in meme coin activity, has also cooled off. As of this writing, it has fallen 13% in the last day and is trading for $0.00000138.\n\nEven as the some of the largest digital assets by market cap take a hit, there's been good news for some alts.\n\nA new report from digital asset manager CoinShares finds that institutional investors have been especially keen on Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX). Exchange-traded products meant to track the two coins saw $5 million worth of deposits last week. And while most of the gaming token category went red on Monday, Immutable (IMX) saw a 10% gain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Binance USD (BUSD)\u2014a dollar-pegged stablecoin\u2014lost its peg for a while on Monday. As of this writing, BUSD had dropped as low as $0.97, according to CoinGecko. Even though it's a defunct stablecoin, there are still roughly 1.4 billion of the tokens in circulation.\n\nOne possible reason for the price turbulence: Most BUSD margin trading and futures contracts were automatically closed today, according to a Binance blog post.\n\nBUSD has been on a steady decline since the SEC sent a Wells Notice to New York-based firm Paxos, which used to handle minting and redemptions of BUSD on behalf of crypto exchange Binance. In the aftermath, Paxos and Binance said that users could continue to redeem their tokens until February 2024.\n\nThe exchange said BUSD tokens that aren't redeemed before Binance stops support will automatically be converted to FDUSD, a stablecoin issued by FD121 Ltd.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $42.1K, down 4.07% today, while Ethereum is at $2.23K, down 4.87%.\n\nHowever, traders continue to rally behind Bitcoin ETF Token as its presale surges toward $3.5 million.\n\nMarket overconfidence corrected, but analysts fear another flush\n\nWarning signs of a steep correction have been everywhere over the past few days. Many analysts urged market participants to proceed cautiously, but some believe another flush is imminent even after the recent correction.\n\nCoinMarketCap\u2019s Crypto Fear and Greed Index entered the \u201cextreme greed\u201d zone, indicating that the market may be overbought. This represents a high-risk time for new buyers to enter the market, as a selloff is necessary to restore balance.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto funding rates recently reached a local high. This indicates significantly more long orders than short orders in the market, causing bulls to pay a premium to rebalance.\n\nHigh funding rates are often followed by a \u201cflush,\u201d where futures positions are forcibly closed, causing prices to cascade in the opposite direction.\n\nYou might also like: Will Bitcoin ETFs follow gold ETFs\u2019 path to success?\n\nThis was highlighted by the analyst Mister Crypto, who suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s high funding rates were \u201csignaling a top.\u201d\n\nIn the analysis, Mister Crypto noted that Bitcoin\u2019s price retraced by 20% each time its funding rates reached their recent levels.\n\nGiven Bitcoin has pulled back less than 5% so far, this could indicate a much deeper correction is imminent.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent X commentator MrChief predicts that the market will \u201cpullback enough to stop out early buyers & get bears super excited then reverse back up.\u201d\n\nHowever, other analysts believe the crypto market may be poised for a longer-term pullback. One is RektCapital, who referenced earlier market cycles\u2019 price action to suggest that \u201cthe Bitcoin Pre-Halving top may be very close.\u201d\n\nThat said, the Bitcoin halving is just 137 days away and spot Bitcoin ETFs are on the cusp of approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As such, the market looks poised for a solid mid-term trajectory.\n\nEven so, market participants seeking growth appear to be considering Bitcoin ETF Token whose presale is in progress.\n\nBitcoin ETF Token presale raises $3.4 million in 1 month\n\nBitcoin ETF Token has raised almost $3.5 million in one month. The project features multiple use cases, rewarding holders as the SEC approves spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe project features a deflationary mechanism. 25% of its supply is reserved to be burned across five Bitcoin ETF milestones.\n\nAdditionally, there is a 5% burn tax on transactions, reducing by 1% at each target.\n\nThese scarcity-focused features, combined with the anticipated $1 trillion in liquidity entering the crypto market from the Bitcoin ETFs, could support Bitcoin ETF Token.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin breaks above $40k, Bitcoin ETF Token raises nearly $2.5m\n\nFurther supporting this is the project\u2019s current early stage and low market cap at launch of just $12.39 million.\n\nBitcoin ETF Token also has a staking mechanism, offering a 79% APY. Even so, this will decrease as more tokens are staked, incentivizing buyers to get in early to maximize their gains.\n\nThe project also offers a Bitcoin ETF Alerts service. This is a news feed that pulls latest Bitcoin updates from around the web into one place.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nOn a day when the majority of the crypto market is in the red, Avalanche (AVAX) emerged as a beacon of hope for cryptocurrency investors, showcasing an impressive rally against market trends. Over the last 24 hours, while leading cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) succumbed to downward pressure, AVAX charted a different course, posting remarkable 12% growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAVAX has been touted as a beta play, often catching up and occasionally outpacing market leaders after significant rallies. With the ecosystem tokens within the AVAX network gaining momentum, it is clear that investor interest is peaking. The currency's ability to smash through resistance levels that have held firm against market titans like Ethereum indicates robust and growing confidence in AVAX's potential.\n\nHappy Monday \u2600\ufe0f#AVAX is today's best performer, up 12% over the past 24 hours \ud83d\udc40\n\n\n\nSource: https://t.co/tihRplvItm pic.twitter.com/srRBtegYng \u2014 Kaiko (@KaikoData) December 11, 2023\n\nWhen compared to Ethereum's price performance, AVAX shines even brighter. Ethereum has been experiencing a period of consolidation after a strong bull run, but its recent pullback has been more pronounced than expected. In contrast, AVAX has managed to not only maintain its bullish stance but also to accelerate its value appreciation, outperforming Ethereum's recent price action.\n\nThis divergence in performance can be partly attributed to the increasing recognition of AVAX as a formidable player in the DeFi space. As a faster and more cost-effective platform, it is garnering attention from developers and investors alike. This interest is translated into price action, with AVAX demonstrating the characteristics of a strong ecosystem token that leverages the broader market's momentum for significant gains.\n\nThe contrast between AVAX and Ethereum during this period speaks volumes about market dynamics. Where Ethereum reflects the larger market's hesitation, AVAX seizes the opportunity to assert its market presence. It is a classic case of the beta token catching up, leveraging the pumping of its counterparts to establish its own rally."

        "content": "This post is sponsored and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe crypto market is poised for another exciting chapter in 2024 as the Web3 space continues to thrill. Crypto enthusiasts are eagerly exploring the landscape for the next wave of coins that will capture the spotlight.\n\nThis comprehensive guide compiles information and insights from market trends and official sources to shed light on the crypto tokens that could make waves in 2024, with a detailed glimpse on the young trendsetter meme coin, ApeMax.\n\nWhat Defines the \u201cNext Big Crypto\u201d?\n\nThe term \u201cnext big crypto\u201d refers to digital currencies with the potential to introduce innovative and distinct features to the crypto landscape. ApeMax exemplifies this concept by being the first \u201cBoost-to-Earn\u201d coin, and Ethereum embodied this by pioneering smart contracts and their use cases.\n\nTop Contenders for the Next Big Crypto in 2024\n\nThis list provides a mix of new entrants alongside industry staples.\n\n1. ApeMax (APEMAX)\n\nApeMax emerges as a revolutionary new coin, boasting a growing presale that is currently open to eligible buyers. Its standout feature allows token holders to earn rewards as they stake or boost entities right from the presale stage, setting it apart from other cryptocurrencies.\n\nRepresenting a fusion of meme culture and practical utility, ApeMax is making waves with its unique features. The ongoing presale for ApeMax is now live for a limited time, including exclusive discount loot boxes for eligible participants.\n\n2. Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum maintains its prominence in the crypto space, leading the charge in the smart contract revolution. The platform\u2019s robust infrastructure continues to empower decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, with the rise of NFTs and Web3 gaming sustaining Ethereum\u2019s relevance.\n\n3. Cardano (ADA)\n\nCardano, with its layered architecture and Ouroboros Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, remains dedicated to scalability and security for smart contracts and DApps. Founded by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, Cardano continues to evolve and innovate, with over $19 billion market cap according to CoinMarketCap.\n\n4. Solana (SOL)\n\nSolana, a third-generation blockchain platform, utilizes PoS and PoH mechanisms to deliver smart contract functionality. Market perception has positioned SOL as a smaller potential \u201cEthereum rival,\u201d owing to its high speeds, low costs, and overall efficiency.\n\nWhich New Crypto is Trending?\n\nRight after Ethereum set the stage with its NFT explosion and the Bitcoin community flexed their creative muscles with Ordinals, fresh tokens like ApeMax, Worldcoin, and Pepe Coin are attracting some of the spotlight. Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are also back in the game with a newfound excitement.\n\nWhat is the Next Crypto Star in 2024?\n\nWhile several tokens, including new coins like ApeMax, are attracting new fans, it\u2019s hard to say which among these coins will be the next star in 2024. The dynamic nature of the crypto ecosystem, influenced by external factors, adds an element of uncertainty to any token\u2019s trajectory.\n\nCan ApeMax Achieve the $1 Milestone?\n\nThe trajectory of ApeMax\u2019s value remains speculative, with factors such as market demand and circulating supply playing pivotal roles. Despite the uncertainty, the ongoing presale momentum and innovative tokenomics position ApeMax a unique new crypto coin.\n\nFinal Considerations\n\n2024 could shape up to be a dynamic year for the crypto market as bullish market sentiment is felt prior to the new year. With Ethereum, Solana, ApeMax and other coins showcasing unique creativity or innovation. However, even if the crypto landscape offers opportunities, enthusiasts should still conduct thorough research prior to engaging with any cryptocurrency.\n\nUnderstanding associated risks and the inherent volatility of crypto is very important. Additionally, it\u2019s also important to note that certain coins, including ApeMax, may have geographical purchase restrictions. Prospective buyers of ApeMax tokens should ensure that they are not from restricted regions and that they comply with all buying prerequisites. Ineligible places are the US, Canada, and other countries. Readers can check the official ApeMax website for up-to-date and thorough information on the subject."

        "content": "Ethereum has long reigned over the NFT sector.\n\nSolana recently overtook Ethereum in NFT sales.\n\nSolana\u2019s uprising could signal a massive shift in industry dynamics.\n\nSolana\u2019s incredible performance this year has positioned the project as a formidable threat to Ethereum\u2019s reign as the network turns heads with its on-chain and trading activity.\n\nAfter successfully surpassing Ethereum in on-chain activity, Solana outshines its rival in another important metric, NFT sales.\n\nSolana Outpaces Ethereum\n\nEthereum has ruled the NFT industry for years with its trading volume, projects, user adoption, and more. However, considering its persistent issues like network congestion and rising fees, its dominance is proving fleeting as competitors like Solana close the gap.\n\nFollowing Solana\u2019s historic run this year, registering over 800% in gains and marking record DEX volumes and network transactions, the network surpassed Ethereum in NFT sales on December 9 after hosting over $16 million.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum trailed closely behind with $13.4 and $11.4 million in sales, respectively. Although Solana remained the second-largest NFT protocol at the time of writing, its trajectory signals a credible threat to Ethereum\u2019s throne.\n\nSolana\u2019s success in the NFT sector aligns with investors and developers slowly warming up to the network and recognizing its potential. While the network is still miles behind Ethereum when considering historical data, Solana\u2019s uprising could signal a massive shift in the industry\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nSolana\u2019s NFT sales are still far below their 2022 levels. In June 2022, Solana registered more than $1 billion in NFT volume.\n\nEthereum\u2019s all-time NFT sales have reached $41 billion, while Solana\u2019s total NFT sales amount to $4 billion.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nSolana overtaking Ethereum signals a potential shift in industry dynamics. Ethereum has long been the dominant force in the NFT sector, boasting high volumes, adoption, and sales. However, Solana is slowly closing the gap and giving the network a run for its money.\n\n\n\nRead how Charles Hoskinson\u2019s innocent update turned into a memecoin frenzy:\n\nCardano Founder Accidental Memecoin Plug Spells Disaster\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Tether\u2019s new policy:\n\nTether\u2019s New Wallet-Freezing Policy: What Holders Need to Know\n\n"

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price could lose critical support at $40,000 as RSI confirms BTC is ripe for selling.\n\nEthereum price clings firm to the uptrend and records a healthy pullback as $2,147 support continues to hold.\n\nRipple price risks an extended 7% fall to the $0.5773 support level as XRP bulls show weakness.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains bullish despite the catastrophic setback recorded during the early trading hours of the Asian session. While several other narratives support the big-picture bullish outlook, spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have a role to play in it.\n\nAs traders and investors continue to anticipate the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) giving approvals for the product launches between January 5 and 10, even Google has taken a hint. An official announcement reveals that \"advertisers offering Cryptocurrency Coin Trust targeting the United States [will be allowed] to advertise those products and services\" beginning January 29, 2024. Notably, this is the same month that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to gain approval in the US.\n\nBitcoin price delivers a healthy retest\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price folding back to record an intra-day low of $40,400 was a healthy retest as the $40,000 psychological level continues to hold as support. If the level holds, then it could precipitate the idea that new all-time highs are in the cards.\n\nMeanwhile, the upside potential remains strong for Bitcoin price as BTC is still not ripe for selling until the Relative Strength Index (RSI) crosses below the 70 level. With the Awesome Oscillator (AO) showing large volumes of green histogram bars, the bulls still maintain a strong presence in the market though. The RSI could simply hold above 70.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Bitcoin price overcome the weekly supply zone extending from $40,698 to $46,999. A weekly candlestick close above the $43,860 mean threshold would confirm the continuation of the primary trend.\n\nSuch a move would set the tone for Bitcoin price to flip the supply zone into a bullish breaker, confirmed by a move above the $48,725 resistance level.In a highly bullish case, Bitcoin price could extend to tag the $66,098 resistance level into a support floor.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nConversely, if the weekly supply zone defends as a resistance order block, Bitcoin price could pull south, losing the support at $40,000. A decisive weekly candlestick close below this level would put BTC on the cliff, potentially rolling over to the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin braces for volatility-filled week with November CPI data release, Fed decision\n\nEthereum price sell-off threatens upside potential\n\nEthereum (ETH) price also crashed alongside Bitcoin, losing almost 9% in market value. However, the move remains a healthy pullback as the $2,147 support level did not break. As long as ETH remains above the $2,000 psychological level, the upside potential remains alive.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could see Ethereum price clear the $2,403 range high even as it continues to consolidate within the confines of an ascending parallel channel.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, increased seller momentum could plunge Ethereum price out of the bullish chart pattern, confirmed by a break and close below critical $2,147 support. ETH might then confirm the continuation of the fall by breaking and closing below the midline of the supply zone turned bullish breaker at $2,075. The move could clear the path for the largest altcoin by market capitalization to spiral to the $2,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum leads altcoins north as Bitcoin halts amid bull trap fears"

        "content": "Cambridge Study: Ethereum Consumes 28x Less Energy Than American Express\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest crypto protocol Ethereum network, is reported to consume 28 times less energy than the American Express business, according to a recent report from the University of Cambridge.\n\nThe report compares the annual energy consumption of the smart contract-powered blockchain service to that of several legacy-based financial and corporate businesses.\n\nAccording to the Cambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Index report, Ethereum\u2019s annual energy consumption of 7 Gigawatts per hour (GWh) is 28 times lower than American Express, which operates on 202.73 GWh.\n\nIt is also 50 times less than the energy consumed by the Deutsche Bank, which uses up 437 GWh.\n\nNEWS: American Express Uses 28x More Energy Than Ethereum Says Cambridge. pic.twitter.com/sFI3ElyluL \u2014 BuzzBeatHQ \ud83d\ude80 (@mely_buzz) December 12, 2023\n\nWhen placed side-by-side in terms of assets under management (AUM), the Deutsche Bank controls more than $820 billion in assets, while Ethereum commands upwards of $350 million both on-chain and in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nThis shows that the Deutsche Bank uses 25 times more energy per dollar managed than the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum network proves to be more energy-efficient than the Netflix streaming service, which consumes 123 GWh annually. It is also more than 30 times less energy intensive than the Burj Khalifa, which uses a mammoth 243.4GWh to power its skyscraper edifice.\n\nFurthermore, the Cambridge report reveals that the 7 GWh energy needs of the smart contract network can only power its campus for 19 days. Other household appliances, such as air conditioners, are also considered in the context of energy consumption.\n\nThe report further outlines that the energy needs of the decentralized finance ecosystem are equivalent to the yearly consumption of 676 air conditioners and are capable of meeting the power needs of 1,969 average households.\n\nMoreover, the 7 GWh output would only be exhausted by a Tesla Cybertruck covering a total distance of 17.1 million.\n\nEthereum\u2019s high-efficiency metrics follow its breakaway from the secure yet slow and energy-cumbersome proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm.\n\nFollowing its switch from a PoW to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism earlier in the year, the validation of transactions and creation of new Ether assets no longer relies on a distributed network of miners who have to compete to be first.\n\nInstead, the Ethereum network requires validators to lock up a minimum of 32 Ether coins in order to verify transactions on the network.\n\nEach validator is selected and only requires software on their computer to keep the network operating optimally.\n\nSupra Makes the Ethereum Jump\n\n\n\nFunctioning as the central hub for all things DeFi, the Ethereum network is a huge attraction for the 2,000 plus decentralized applications (dApps) that operate in its ecosystem.\n\nSo far, the open-source, decentralized protocol has maintained a 19% market share of the crypto market with huge potential to become a strong contender for the crypto throne in the near future.\n\nThis potential is further strengthened by the recent launch of the decentralized Verifiable Random Function (dVRF) service on the Ethereum mainnet by the SupraOracles dApp.\n\nThe dVRF allows blockchain protocols to securely access real-world information authenticated by a vetted pool of data providers.\n\n\u26a1 @SupraOracles is thrilled to announce that we've successfully launched our decentralized Verifiable Random Function (dVRF) service on the #Ethereum Mainnet \ud83c\udf89 This is a huge step forward for our team \ud83d\udc63 pic.twitter.com/18mipr5pzn \u2014 Supra (@SupraOracles) December 12, 2023\n\nThe SupraOracles network joins a growing pool of decentralized oracle networks (DONs) that help blockchain services stay in the loop of happenings outside of themselves."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s net supply has been shrinking at an annual rate of 0.248%\n\nProjections highlighted interesting observations for Ethereum\u2019s supply\n\nMore than 307,000 Ethereum [ETH] coins have exited circulation since the pivotal \u2018Merge\u2019 event. In fact, this was the lowest volume of ETH in circulation since the network made a historic shift from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nETH\u2019s supply goes south\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s scrutiny of ultra sound money data, the net supply has been shrinking at an annual rate of 0.248%. This might appear inconsequential to some but fathom this \u2013 Had the transition not taken place, ETH\u2019s total supply would have increased by more than 4.71 million with an annual inflation rate of 3.168%.\n\nScarcity is critical to the long-term demand of any financial asset. In the case of cryptocurrencies, the fewer tokens in circulation, the greater the likelihood of price increases, provided demand for the asset remains the same.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s current supply stood at 120.21 million. As per long-term projections, the supply has hit its peak, with the same to gradually start declining from next year. By the end of 2025, the total number of ETH in circulation is predicted to shrink to 117.7 million.\n\nA much-needed respite\n\nThis is a welcome development as not too long ago, ETH became inflationary owing to poor participation on the network. For much of September and early October, more coins were getting created than they were burned.\n\nAs examined by AMBCrypto using Glassnode\u2019s data, network fees tumbled to yearly lows during the aforementioned period. This suggested that transactions on the network had declined, leading to fewer ETH getting burned.\n\nNote that a part of the fee charged for validating transactions, called base fee, is burned and removed from circulation. Generally, a bull market with high network usage aids deflation and vice versa.\n\nRead ETH\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nMarket still upbeat, despite pullback\n\nAt press time, the second-largest cryptocurrency was exchanging hands at $2.240, having just recorded one of the sharpest corrections since the commencement of the bull rally in October.\n\nHaving said that, the market sentiment remains optimistic. Greed remains uniform across the market, with AMBCrypto using Hyblock Capital\u2019s data to highlight the same. This is a key finding since it is generally assumed that greed drives the asset\u2019s value higher."

        "title": "Is ETH Still on Track for $2.5K Following the Correction? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "In the wake of a remarkable surge that propelled Ethereum to a yearly high of $2.4K, the subsequent encounter with selling pressure resulted in a notable rejection.\n\nPresently, ETH finds itself within a critical price range, and a breakout from this range will likely chart the course for the cryptocurrency\u2019s next moves.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nEthereum has displayed significant bullish signals, with the price exhibiting a robust uptrend that retraced above the pivotal resistance level of $2.1K. Despite a temporary setback, the cryptocurrency maintained its upward trajectory, reaching an annual peak of $2.4K. This PA suggests a revived bullish market, reflecting renewed demand and heightened buying interest among market participants.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that short-term corrections typically follow each bullish surge. As evident from the chart, Ethereum\u2019s upward momentum faced rejection upon hitting the upper boundary of the wedge, resulting in a 10% decline.\n\nThe divergence between the price and the RSI indicator also supports the likelihood of a brief retracement before initiating the next bullish move. In such a scenario, the $2K support zone is anticipated to be Ethereum\u2019s next destination in the daily timeframe.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nA closer examination of the 4-hour chart reveals that Ethereum\u2019s robust upward movement lost momentum upon encountering a pivotal resistance zone, encompassing the $2.4K price range and the upper threshold of the ascending wedge pattern. On the other hand, the expanded bearish divergence between the price and RSI played a crucial role in triggering a substantial rejection.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has already reached a crucial support region, encompassing the price range between 0.5 ($2,211) and 0.618 ($2,166) Fibonacci levels and the static support level of $2K. A breach below these critical support levels may signal a significant downturn in the market.\n\nDespite the prevailing bullish sentiment and apparent control by buyers in the current market dynamics, there exists a notable likelihood of a temporary consolidation correction phase in the short term, accompanied by increased volatility.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has recently surged, reclaiming the $2,1K price range, sparking expectations among market participants of the onset of a new long-term bull market. Accordingly, examining the sentiment in the futures market can offer valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s overall prospects.\n\nThis chart illustrates Ethereum\u2019s open interest, a measure of the number of open perpetual futures contracts on a daily basis. Typically, higher values indicate increased volatility and potential bearish reversals, while lower values suggest a more sustainable trend. As the chart clearly illustrates, a gradual rise in the Open Interest metric often accompanies bullish market phases. However, if the metric reaches elevated levels, it could signal a potential major market reversal.\n\nThe open interest has been on an upward trajectory but has yet to reach values observed during the all-time highs. Consequently, while corrections are always possible, the futures market is still far from overheating. The current bullish trend, supported by moderate levels of open interest, will likely persist in the coming weeks. Monitoring this metric will be essential to gauge potential shifts in market sentiment and adapt strategies accordingly."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWhen Bitcoin and Ethereum fall, so too do most other major cryptocurrencies. That's true again today with most prominent gaming tokens as the market tumbled beginning late Sunday. But Immutable\u2019s IMX token is the one big exception, bucking the trend while continuing its recent rise.\n\nThe broader market may be down about 5% over the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko, but IMX has climbed a total of 10% during that span to a current price of $2.00. The price did dip briefly late Sunday along with other top tokens, but then quickly rebounded, popping as high as $2.06 early Monday. That\u2019s a 20-month high for the gaming token.\n\nImmutable is an Ethereum gaming platform that\u2019s based around the current Immutable X scaling network, as well as the upcoming Immutable zkEVM network powered by Polygon zkEVM. IMX is now up 41% in the last week alone, pushing the token to an 83% jump in the last 30 days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFollowing recent collaboration announcements with Amazon and major game publisher Ubisoft, IMX may have also seen a recent boost following a vote of confidence from investment firm VanEck late last week.\n\nIn a report on crypto predictions for 2024, VanEck suggested that IMX is poised to become a top 25 coin by market cap\u2014it\u2019s currently #31 following recent gains\u2014alongside the release of upcoming games like Illuvium and Guild of Guardians. VanEck also said that Immutable has been \u201cworking to resolve many of the technical pain points that have inhibited the success of Web3 gaming so far.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Immutable announced a new collaboration with payments processor Transak to make it the \u201cprimary payments partner\u201d for Immutable Checkout on the zkEVM network.\n\nThe only other gaming token on the rise today in the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market cap is Echelon Prime (PRIME), the token of the buzzy NFT trading card game Parallel, which is up 12% over the past 24 hours to a current price of just under $8.00. PRIME, which launched earlier this year, just set an all-time high in late November at $8.93.\n\nBroadly, however, major gaming tokens are down today following weeks of recent gains. The Sandbox (SAND), Axie Infinity (AXS), Illuvium (ILV), and ApeCoin (APE) are each down about 9% over the past 24 hours, while recent riser Ronin (RON) is down nearly 7% to $1.54. Even so, RON is up 93% over the past month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market faced a significant downturn, the SHIB/USDT chart showcased a resilience that not many had expected. While Ethereum (ETH) experienced a notable decline, failing to maintain its upward momentum, SHIB managed to stay within an ascending channel, suggesting stronger relative bullish sentiment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe price chart for Shiba Inu reflects an asset that, despite market-wide corrections, has stuck to its ascending trajectory. This resilience is indicative of an unexpected support base and existing demand for SHIB, even during volatile market movements. On the other hand, Ethereum's chart tells a different story; the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap broke below key support levels, indicating a less resilient price performance in the same period.\n\nOne reason for SHIB's surprising strength could be its recent history. Unlike Ethereum, which had been rallying to new highs, SHIB's rally was of a smaller magnitude, leading to less drastic corrections. With smaller gains, there was less ground to fall back on during the market pullback, allowing SHIB to maintain its composure and trend within its channel.\n\nThe moderate rally of Shiba Inu meant that when the market tumbled, the meme coin did not have as far to drop. In contrast, Ethereum's significant rally set higher expectations and a stronger potential for profit-taking, which likely contributed to its steeper decline. This difference in precorrection performance allowed SHIB to demonstrate a notable divergence from Ethereum's price path.\n\nIn comparison to Ethereum's chart, which broke below its 50-day moving average \u2014 a bearish sign \u2014 SHIB's price is hovering above its own, maintaining bullish indications. This stark contrast in technical posture between the two cryptocurrencies underscores the current narrative: SHIB's market is showing signs of persistent buyer interest and could be positioned for a quicker recovery post-correction."

Rather than succumbing to panic, investors demonstrate impressive resilience by capitalizing on the lower prices.\n\nAccording to data from Lookonchain, an astute whale just transferred 55 million USDT to Binance, signaling a clear intention to buy more $ETH during this slowdown period.\n\nThis strategic move is not isolated, as the same whale, originally a fan of swing trading on ETH, had sold a significant amount of tokens in November. After a one-month hiatus, this smart whale is returning to the market, suggesting a long-term vision and renewed confidence in Ethereum\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\nThese deliberate actions by institutional investors indicate a careful analysis of the market and optimism about Ethereum\u2019s recovery capacity.\n\nA Temporary Correction That Does Not Undermine Fundamentals\n\nIn another positive note, DWF Labs, a major player in the crypto market, recently revealed its largest ETH accumulation over the past two months.\n\nIn a clear tactical move, DWF Labs transferred no less than 280 ETH ($626,000) from the Bitfinex platform, just a few hours ago, revealing its solid commitment to a long-term holding strategy for the Ethereum token.\n\nThis strategic accumulation emphasizes the continued confidence of major market players in the long-term stability of Ethereum, even during periods of temporary correction.\n\nIn the meantime, several analyses predict that Ethereum, at its current price, remains undervalued relative to its solid fundamentals and the current trend on the crypto market, largely dominated by Bitcoin.\n\nIn conclusion, these positive elements, however, should not make us forget the inherent risks of cryptocurrencies.

        "title": "Digital currency's Titanic: Ethereum's sinking ship of flawed technology exposed - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Much like the Titanic setting sail with fanfare and promise, Ethereum emerged on the digital currency scene as a beacon of blockchain innovation. With its smart contracts and decentralized applications, it promised to revolutionize finance and create a decentralized internet.\n\nHowever, as we delve beneath the surface, like the iceberg that sank the Titanic, Ethereum\u2019s technical and security flaws lurk ominously, threatening to sink investors\u2019 hopes and funds into the icy abyss of financial despair.\n\nEthereum\u2019s technical flaws\n\nScalability issues\n\nEthereum (ETH) advocates often boast about its transition to Ethereum 2.0, heralding it as the solution to the network\u2019s long-standing scalability woes. However, Ethereum 2.0 grapples with fundamental scaling limitations even with a new genesis block\u200b\u200b.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with ETH\u2019s scalability issues, notably a low transaction throughput of around five transactions per second. This limitation has been acknowledged even by the project\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin\u200b\u200b.\n\nSlow transaction speeds\n\nThe scalability problem is exacerbated during high-traffic periods, making Ethereum less capable of handling increased load during bull markets\u200b.\n\nEthereum\u2019s defenders may argue that its slower transaction speeds are a trade-off for better security. However, these slow speeds, especially during high network demand, hamper its usability for real-time applications, creating a bottleneck that\u2019s hard to overlook.\n\nHigh gas fees\n\nThe argument that high gas fees are a measure of Ethereum\u2019s popularity and network usage falls flat when these fees devour small investors\u2019 funds, making many transactions unfeasible.\n\nYour system simply can\u2019t support microtransactions if the fees cost 10,000% more than the amount you want to send.\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nSmart contract vulnerabilities\n\nDespite the many smart contracts deployed on Ethereum, security flaws have led to significant financial losses, undermining the ecosystem\u2019s stability\u200b\u200b. Ethereum bagholders might argue that these are growing pains, but the recurring issues highlight a systemic problem.\n\nSeth Green, the actor and creator of \u201cRobot Chicken,\u201d faced a significant setback when his Bored Ape NFT #8398, crucial for his upcoming animated series \u201cWhite Horse Tavern,\u201d was stolen in a phishing attack. The NFT, named Fred Simian in the series, was to be the main character. Green, who had developed the show around this NFT for over a year, was forced into a complex situation involving legal rights and ownership issues. Eventually, he paid an additional 165 ETH (about $260,000) to retrieve the NFT.\n\nMeanwhile, BSV blockchain\u2019s re-enabled smart contracting shows promise with potentially better security provisions and could bypass the pitfalls that have plagued Ethereum.\n\n51% attack threat\n\nThe switch to a Proof of Stake (PoS) model, as Ethereum advocates argue, is to reduce energy consumption. However, this switch exposes Ethereum to new security issues, making it more vulnerable than its Proof of Work (PoW) predecessor.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s tried-and-tested PoW mechanism continues to provide robust security, a feature Ethereum traded for short-term narrative benefits, thus potentially putting investor funds at risk.\n\nLack of privacy\n\nWhile providing transparency, Ethereum\u2019s open ledger system and account-based model expose user transactions to the public eye. Advocates may argue this transparency is a boon, but with one wallet for everything, the trade-off in privacy can have profound implications.\n\nActor and comedian Bill Murray\u2019s digital currency wallet, used to sell official NFTs inspired by his life, was once attacked following a charity auction. The attack resulted in a loss of $174,000 from his wallet.\n\nBlockchain solutions using the UTXO (unspent transaction outputs) model offer better privacy measures while maintaining transparency, providing a more balanced approach to user privacy and security.\n\nThe vaporware concern\n\nEthereum\u2019s repeated failure to deliver on its scaling promises, even with Ethereum 2.0, raises concerns about it being glamourized vaporware, with fundamental design flaws inhibiting its progress\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe mirage of a fully scalable and secure Ethereum continues to elude its developers, casting a long, chilling shadow on crypto\u2019s future, much like the Titanic\u2019s voyage cut short by an unforeseen disaster.\n\nAs Ethereum sails through the stormy seas of the digital currency world, the iceberg of technical and security flaws looms large. Buterin\u2019s ship is steered by a narrative that does not hold water when scrutinized closely.\n\nCompetition and conclusion\n\nThe watershed moment has already begun with the advent of Ordinals, as BTC increasingly sees more NFT sales volume daily than ETH and Solana combined. This trend will only continue with the wave of fungible tokens on BTC.\n\nAdditionally, the recent introduction of BitVM is a noteworthy advancement. By allowing smart contracts without altering BTC\u2019s consensus rules and eliminating the need for a hard fork, BitVM could significantly expand the scope and capabilities of BTC.\n\nMeanwhile, as Xiaohui Liu notes, sCrypt is literally \u201ca development platform for smart contracts\u201d on Bitcoin. These developments have led to a broader range of applications and use cases, making Bitcoin a more versatile and powerful blockchain than Ethereum.\n\nBefore boarding digital currency\u2019s Titanic, investors ought to eye the lifeboats of alternative, more seaworthy vessels. The digital ocean is vast, and while Ethereum may have launched with promise, the icebergs in its path pose a threat too significant to ignore.\n\nIn stark contrast, the BSV blockchain has shattered records, boasting thousands of times more throughput capability than Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nThanks to its unbounded scalability, the BSV network handles thousands of transactions per second. With the BSV blockchain, smart contracts run with transaction fees that are 1000x cheaper than Ethereum, showcasing a more economically viable platform.\n\nHow long can the market stay irrational?\n\nThis article introduces a new series, FUDslinging: Facts, Uncertainty, and Doubt.

        "content": "Press Releases are sponsored content and not a part of Finbold's editorial content. For a full disclaimer, please click here. If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to [email protected]. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has disclosed a postponement in its decision regarding Grayscale\u2019s proposed Ethereum (ETH) spot ETF. The SEC cites the necessity for additional time to evaluate a proposed rule change enabling NYSE Arca to list and trade shares associated with the Grayscale Ethereum Trust. Meanwhile, a surge of excitement within the Reddit community surrounds an emerging AI altcoin, InQubeta (QUBE), heightening interest in the intersection of artificial intelligence and the crypto market.\n\nInQubeta attracts the market with its unique ecosystem that mints opportunities into NFTs. The NFT marketplace has been the center of attraction, propelling it as the best crypto to buy for significant gain. Analysts predict that QUBE holds the potential to multiply investors\u2019 portfolios by ten times by the year 2024.\n\nLet\u2019s explore why the Reddit buzz around InQubeta is intensifying amid Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum ETF hopes being delayed.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): Igniting the Crypto Space with an Innovative AI Crowdfunding Platform.\n\nInQubeta, a new DeFi crypto, is gaining momentum as it introduces a groundbreaking crypto crowdfunding platform. The Reddit buzz surrounding this emerging AI altcoin has intensified as investors learn more about its offerings. The platform facilitates fractional investments in AI startups using QUBE tokens, a deflationary ERC20 token. The innovative investment protocol involving NFT minting and fractionalization has fueled the hype surrounding the QUBE platform. Through this approach, investors can invest in a way that suits their budget, all while enjoying the benefits of being an early backer.\n\nThe InQubeta NFT marketplace enables AI startups to raise funds through reward and equity-based NFTs. Also, QUBE token holders can seamlessly invest in projects, fostering a symbiotic ecosystem. The deflationary mechanism of InQubeta has further intensified the Reddit excitement surrounding the QUBE token. With a 2% buy and sell tax directed to a burning wallet and a 5% tax contributing to a dedicated reward pool, QUBE holders can stake their tokens, earning rewards and positioning QUBE as the best crypto to buy for those eyeing the potential growth of AI tech startups.\n\nThe governance role of this new DeFi crypto is another feature that is growing Reddit interest in the QUBE token. It empowers holders to engage actively in platform decisions, fostering a democratic approach to development, operations, and future directions. With a surge in demand anticipated due to expanding participation from investors and startups, the value of QUBE is poised to rise. Investors can capitalize on potential price appreciation and earn rewards from the dedicated pool by holding and staking QUBE tokens.\n\nAs the presale progresses through stage six, influential crypto figures have shown keen interest in the QUBE token. With over 626 million tokens already sold at the presale price of $0.01925, the heightened buzz around QUBE continues to grow. This best crypto investment platform has already raised over $6.6 million in presale funding.\n\nSEC Postpones Decision on Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum (ETH) ETF: Evaluation Extended Until 2024.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Ethereum ETF hopes have been delayed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which declared a postponement in its decision-making process. This extension involves the SEC allocating a prolonged period for evaluating the proposed rule change, with January 25, 2024, designated as the deadline for either its decision or the initiation of proceedings to determine disapproval.\n\nEmphasizing the need for sufficient time to thoroughly assess the Ethereum spot ETF proposal and address concerns raised, the SEC aims for a comprehensive evaluation. Despite previous approvals of investment vehicles tied to crypto futures, the SEC has yet to greenlight a spot Bitcoin (BTC) or ETH ETF on a U.S. exchange. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart speculates that approval of a spot BTC ETF might open the door for simultaneous approvals of funds from multiple firms, potentially reshaping the landscape.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe InQubeta Reddit buzz continues to escalate amidst the delay on Grayscale\u2019s ETH ETF. InQubeta\u2019s NFT marketplace and deflationary mechanism set it at the forefront of AI technology innovation. This best crypto investment platform has been a hub of attention during its presale. Investors who want to participate in this AI revolution can purchase the QUBE token via the website using crypto coins like ETH, BTC, or USDT.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nBinance Withdraws Ruble Pairs: Binance is ending support for several P2P trading pairs with the Russian ruble, including BTC/RUB and ETH/RUB, effective January 31, 2024, following its exit from the Russian market. Transition Options for Users: Russian users can switch to CommEX for continued ruble trading or use Binance\u2019s options for withdrawing or converting rubles before the deadline. New Listings and Margin Trading: Binance added new tokens like PIVX and trading pairs to its Margin Trading program, allowing leveraged trades with higher profit and risk potential.\n\nBinance to Exit Russia\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange by market capitalization \u2013 Binance \u2013 announced it will no longer support certain P2P trading pairs tied to Russia\u2019s national currency \u2013 the ruble.\n\nThose pairs include BTC/RUB, ETH/RUB, USDT/RUB, BNB/RUB, FDUSD/RUB, BUSD/RUB, and RUB/RUB, as the amendments are scheduled to take effect from January 31, 2024.\n\nBinance\u2019s move follows the previous decision to exit the Russian market by selling the entirety of its local business to the crypto platform CommEX.\n\n\u201cTherefore, users can continue P2P trading with Russian ruble (RUB) free of charge on the CommEX platform,\u201d the exchange explained.\n\nThose willing to jump on board need to register with a CommEX account and connect it to the corresponding Binance one. Alternatively, clients have the option to withdraw their Russian rubles via Binance\u2019s fiat partners before January 31, 2024, convert RUB into digital assets, or trade RUB for crypto on the Binance Spot market.\n\nBinance\u2019s Latest Listing\n\nBesides removing certain trading pairs, the leading marketplace has expanded some its offerings with more tokens.\n\nLast week, it added PIVX (PIVX) as a new borrowable digital asset on Cross Margin and Isolated Margin. It also included ADA/FDUSD and DOGE/FDUSD, among other trading pairs, in its Isolated Margin program.\n\nBinance Margin Trading allows eligible clients access to funds from the exchange for use in leveraged trades. Thus, traders can deal with greater sums and adjust their positions appropriately.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that margin trading could bring greater profits in the case of successful trades. Nonetheless, it could lead to more significant losses if the market moves in the opposite direction."

        "content": "A key indicator seemed to suggest that ETH might fall to $2,150 before a bull run\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s social metrics dropped, a few market indicators were bearish\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] price recently fell victim to a price correction like the rest of the crypto-market. Ahead of the said episode, a key ETH indicator flashed a similar outcome. Not only that, but AMBCrypto has also reported how top players in the crypto-space lost some faith in ETH as they started to sell their holdings.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price is dropping\n\nAfter a comfortable rally, the king of altcoins\u2019 price registered a decline in the short-term. According to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by nearly 5% in the last 24 hours alone. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,239.24 with a market capitalization of over $269 billion.\n\nUnfortunately, ETH\u2019s trading volume increased while its price dropped, which is generally perceived as a bearish signal. In fact, Ali, a popular crypto-analyst, rightfully pointed out yet another bearish metric for Ethereum.\n\n#Ethereum | The TD Sequential has flashed a sell signal on the $ETH 3-day chart. \ud83d\udea8 If this signal is confirmed, it might set up a prime buying opportunity with #ETH potentially retracing to $2,150. This could be a key moment before a potential rally toward $3,500. pic.twitter.com/hozCr7CNQZ \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 10, 2023\n\nAccording to the analyst, the TD Sequential has flashed a sell signal on Ethereum\u2019s 3-day chart.\n\nFor starters, the TD Sequential is a tool designed to identify the exact time of trend exhaustion and price reversal. Ali mentioned that if this signal is confirmed, it might set up a prime buying opportunity, with ETH potentially retracing to $2,150. Considering the ongoing price trend, the possibility of ETH falling to $2,150 seems to be high.\n\nWhat to expect from ETH\n\nTo better understand what ETH\u2019s future might look like, AMBCrypto checked the token\u2019s on-chain metrics. Our analysis found that selling pressure on the token was high as its exchange reserve was increasing, as per CryptoQuant\u2019s data.\n\nAdditionally, both ETH\u2019s Korea Premium and Funds Premium were red, meaning Korean investors and institutional investors have been selling their holdings.\n\nNot only retail investors, but as reported previously by AMBCrypto, whales are also selling ETH. To be precise, a whale made a significant deposit of 3,700 ETH (equivalent to $8.72 million) to Binance recently.\n\nHere, it is interesting to note that while the token\u2019s price dropped sharply, its social volume also declined slightly. Negative sentiment around the token skyrocketed too, as is evidenced by the dip in its weighted sentiment.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023\u201324\n\nAMBCrypto then had a look at ETH\u2019s daily chart to see the viability of the token\u2019s price plummeting further.\n\nEthereum\u2019s MACD projected the possibility of a bearish crossover, which can push the token\u2019s price down to the $2,150-mark in the near term. On the contrary, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered an uptick \u2013 An optimistic sign."

        "content": "Ethereum's role in the crypto ecosystem and its appeal to investors continue to shape its trajectory, closely intertwined with developments in interest rates.\n\nEthereum exhibited a back-and-forth pattern during the early hours of Friday, revealing signs of potential strain in this market.\n\nHowever, Ethereum's performance has lagged behind Bitcoin, suggesting it may have some ground to cover.\n\nIn any case, the prevailing trend continues to draw enthusiastic buyers during dips, with Thursday's impressive surge standing out, particularly given Bitcoin's relative stability.\n\nThe common driver behind this crypto ascent remains the trajectory of interest rates.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nRemarkably, Ethereum managed to breach a formidable resistance barrier nestled near the $2100 level. This breakthrough has unlocked the prospect of ascending to loftier altitudes. Presently, Ethereum hovers just above the $2300 level, and it seems that short-term retracements will persistently present buying opportunities, with the $2100 level serving as a pivotal support zone. Of particular note, the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average stands around the $1950 mark, an indicator closely scrutinized by many market participants.\n\nOn the horizon, Ethereum could potentially set its sights on the $2500 level, a significant milestone by virtue of its round, psychologically resonant value. The $2500 level would undoubtedly attract considerable attention and generate headlines. The overarching strategy in this landscape is the pursuit of value and the strategic exploitation of opportunities. Ethereum's long-term trajectory and its potential adoption as an everyday utility remain uncertain. However, Ethereum's role as the foundational platform for numerous other crypto projects continues to drive demand, as evidenced on multiple occasions in the past.\n\nEthereum's Trajectory Amid Dollar Decline and Interest Rate Dynamics\n\nIn the broader context, the market will persist in its quest for value, capitalizing on the possibility that the US dollar may continue its decline. It's worth noting that a dramatic surge in interest rates could exert downward pressure not only on Ethereum but on the entire crypto spectrum. It's important to remember that cryptocurrencies represent a relatively high-risk asset class on the institutional investor spectrum. Consequently, the flow of capital will ebb, and flow based on fluctuations in the \"risk-free rate\" of bonds.\n\nIn the end, the breach of the $2100 resistance level has opened the door to higher price targets, while the $2500 level looms as a significant psychological threshold. Ethereum's role in the crypto ecosystem and its appeal to investors continue to shape its trajectory, closely intertwined with developments in interest rates. The crypto market remains an arena of volatility, where position sizing \u2013 and trend following will be paramount.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD?

        "content": "Although the concept of a smart contract has existed since the 1990s, Ethereum was the first platform to recognize its potential and remove the necessity for a third party through its implementation. This has contributed to the advancement of the smart contract market.\n\nHowever, according to a Banklesstimes.com analysis, the number of new smart contracts deployed over the past six months has fallen by over 90%. The number of new smart contracts deployed on June 1, 2023, stood at 1.4m. However, 60.4k smart contracts were deployed on Ethereum on December 1.\n\nBanklessTimes crypto expert Alice Leetham commented:\n\nTypically, the number of contracts executed on a contract network indicates the level of on-chain engagement. There is a greater chance that this engagement could impact price movements when there are more dApps in various sectors, like DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and others. This is because ETH, the token of Ethereum, is utilized for settling network fees. BanklessTimes crypto expert Alice Leetham\n\nShe added that whenever there is a spike in on-chain activity, the demand for block space is higher, requiring developers to use more ETH for a slot in a block.\n\n$3000 in the First Few Days of 2024?\n\nFalling contract deployment coincides with the exemplary performance of ETH prices. ETH prices have rallied from $1873.91 on June 1st to $2352.50 on December 11th. Even though bulls are yet to push the coin above $2400, an immediate resistance level that, if broken, could see ETH prices float to new 2024 highs.\n\nThroughout history, there has been a link between the quantity of contracts utilized and the corresponding price movements. It is common for developers to intensify their efforts when prices are on a trend, resulting in contracts being deployed. However, it is worth noting that this pattern was not evident in the performance observed earlier in June. During that time, there was a disparity between spot prices and the number of contracts launched.\n\nDespite experiencing a fivefold increase between January 14 and January 23, there is potential for a much higher number of contracts if this action were synchronized with the fluctuations in ETH prices.\n\nHowever, it's worth mentioning that smart contracts on the Ethereum network have shown growth in 2022. According to a report from Alchemy, a software company, over 100,000 dApps were introduced during the course of the year."

In comparison, major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD both saw an over 6% decline in the same timeframe.\n\nWhat Happened: According to CoinGlass, ADA's open interest in the past 24 hours has declined by 14%, signaling an outflow of money from the market.\n\nCrypto analyst, Ali Martinez took to his X handle on Dec.9, pointing out that sell signals can be seen on both the 3-day and 1-day ADA charts marking a potential correction of one to four candlesticks. He went on to add, \u201cThis may just be a short-term pullback before #Cardano resumes its uptrend!\u201d\n\nThe Cardano community on Sunday celebrated the 208th birthday of Ada Lovelace, a pioneering mathematician and computer programmer. Her work laid the foundation for modern computing.\n\nWhy It Matters: With a Total Value Locked of $367.87 million, based on DefiLlama data, Cardano has managed its way into the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Notably, ADA has seen a price surge of 32.5% in its last seven-day trading session, peaking at its highest level since June 2022.\n\nThe Cardano Foundation announced the launch of a self-sovereign \u201cIdentity Wallet\u201d on Monday for managing self-sovereign identities across Cardano and other blockchain networks. The wallet, which is a W3C-compatible mobile wallet, consists of a mobile application available for iOS and Android.\n\nThe wallet supports multiple identity and credential standards, securely manages digital assets, smooth interactions with DApps on Cardano, reduces barriers to entry for new users, and provides interoperability across various ecosystems.\n\nLast week, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson tagged rapper 50 Cent on X stating that, \u201cwe are both in the same club.\u201d The message received a positive response from the Cardano community.\n\nX Rumors Lead FREYA Rally: Separately, Hoskinson took to his X handle with a picture of his pet dog, Freya, and stated, \u201cSanta Bart is coming for Christmas.\u201d The post unintentionally sparked a trading frenzy in the Freya NFT project.\n\nHe later clarified in another post on X that he was not associated with the Freya project. \"I have nothing to do with fan projects like Freya or other NFT plays.

        "content": "The crypto big fish are heavily positioned in Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) as they go head-to-head to become the top smart contract platform. But with Everlodge transforming a $82b market, holders of the two assets are moving to the potentially better investment, especially with the ELDG price surging by 170% during the presale event. Let's look at this new entrant and its impact on the market.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): Digitizing the Global Vacation Rental Market for Huge Returns\n\nEverlodge uses NFTs and blockchain technology to offer fractional ownership of holiday residences. This provides investors with the opportunity to earn passive income and capital gains by owning a piece of property in popular tourist destinations.\n\nWith the global vacation rental market estimated to be worth 82.63 billion in 2022, Everlodge has a huge market to tap into. It's easy to see why some of Ethereum and Solana's earliest investors are now shifting their focus to this new project.\n\nEverlodge is creating a whole ecosystem of features to support the innovative model, and one of the most exciting is the Rewards Club. This exclusive club offers free stays at Everlodge's extensive properties similar to timeshares. Members receive a certain number of free nights each year that can be used or traded on the marketplace.\n\nWe're thrilled to announce that our website just got a makeover! \ud83d\udcbb\n\n\n\nCheck out the fresh look and discover the NEW features we've added. It's all about making your experience even better!\n\n\n\nPlus, remember that our Presale is still ON.\n\n\n\nExplore now: https://t.co/SIYWBylwQD#RWA pic.twitter.com/aTuT8x7z36 \u2014 Everlodge (@EverlodgeHQ) October 23, 2023\n\nThe ELDG sits at the center of the ecosystem by facilitating transactions for booking stays and trading properties on the platform. The token also serves as a governance token, as well as offering passive income returns and discounts to those who stake the token. Such utility makes ELDG a valuable asset to hold for long-term investors.\n\nELDG tokens are available for purchase at $0.027 in the eighth presale phase after a 170% surge since the event started. The price increases with the start of each phase, so early investors have a higher chance of making significant gains.\n\nExperts predict that ELDG will experience a staggering 30-fold surge on launch day. This forecast is based on the current presale momentum, the size of the $82B global vacation property market, and the innovative features of Everlodge.\n\nFor more information about the ongoing Everlodge (ELDG) Presale, please visit their website.\n\nCatalysts for Ethereum (ETH)'s Growth\n\nHundreds of competitors have challenged Ethereum, but it remains the undisputed king of smart contract technology in terms of market cap ($270b) and TVL ($28.50b). The developer community is vast, and the platform has become a go-to for building decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nHowever, Ethereum has been outperformed by Bitcoin this year as the latter looks ready to be accepted into the mainstream. The chart shows Ethereum was priced at 0.077 BTC on January 1st but now is trading at a mere 0.0563 BTC \u2014 the lowest price since July 2022.\n\nHowever, it's not all bad news for Ethereum holders. Blackrock and other institutional players have applied for spot Ethereum ETFs to be accepted by the SEC. This could catalyze ETH to break its all-time high and start a new bull run. There is also the upcoming EIP-4844 update, which introduces danksharding for improved scalability and lower gas fees.\n\nStill, many Ethereum holders are switching to newer projects with a higher reward potential. Breaking the $2,500 resistance could result in a fresh bull run toward the $10,000 level, but a 4x return is not exciting to all investors. With Everlodge predicted to surge by 100x when it hits exchanges, some see it as a more promising investment opportunity.\n\nSolana (SOL) Price Prediction 2024\n\nSolana is on Ethereum's tail as the #1 platform for developers to build decentralized applications and protocols. This is evidenced by 50% more people viewing the SolDev developer courses than just two months ago. Additionally, Solana recently surpassed 50 million daily transactions, with over $200b moved on-chain during November.\n\nSolana holders believe it may become the top layer-one platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its super-fast transaction speeds that don't rely on layer-2 infrastructure make Solana an obvious choice for developers looking to build scalable and efficient decentralized applications.\n\nBut just how much further can the price of Solana go? The SOL token was valued at just $8 in January but peaked at $77 this month. A 10x increase from the current price of $69.40 would represent a Solana market cap of $290 billion.\n\nWhile such a high market cap is possible if Solana can secure billions in TVL and actually rival Ethereum as the go-to platform for DeFi and NFTs, it is far from guaranteed. Some Solana whales are taking profits from the 862% rally and jumping into the Everlodge presale to ride another wave of growth potentially."

Yet, the top altcoins in the market that benefited from its surge are not slowing down.

Armed with trending NFTs that double as game characters within the platform\u2019s metaverse, this project supports artisanal miners in underdeveloped regions. Mining takes on a whole new meaning within the NuggetRush ecosystem, as gamers who begin their adventure with limited resources must explore the mines in search of treasures with real-world value.\n\nThe top ICO has been on a roll as its presale has accomplished incredible feats. Launched a short while ago, the presale is selling out fast, nearing the end of its third phase. This journey unfolds in three distinct phases, each with an allocated number of tokens.

The top altcoin has risen by over 39% in the past three months, causing other tokens hosted within its ecosystem to surge. Expert analysts weigh in their takes on the ETH surge, and Bluntz, a pseudonymous analyst, has shared with his followers on X that Ethereum has entered the bull phase, having broken out its year-and-a-half range.\n\nEthereum is predicted to explode with an inevitable rage with its over 92% increase in the past year. The token is taking center stage as BTC slows its bullish trend, causing more investors to acknowledge the number two crypto token. This could be the start of the altcoin season, and ETH investors are eagerly looking forward to and anticipating a positive outcome.\n\nSolana (SOL): Surging With Renewed Enthusiasm On The DeFi Crypto List\n\nSolana has been on the rise in the past few months, with its native token, SOL, surging exceptionally and its ecosystem benefiting from this uptrend.

Solana is outperforming Ethereum in terms of sheer market volume regarding daily transactions.\n\nStep Data Insights analyzed this data, noting that the daily active wallets on Solana surpass 400,000. This indicates an increase in the users flocking to Solana\u2019s ecosystem to leverage its DeFi and NFT offerings, among other protocols. SOL maintains an uptrend as investor confidence grows, pushing the token past 210% in the past three months.\n\nConclusion\n\nInvestors are thrilled at the signs of the altcoin season as the top-performing tokens on the decentralized cryptocurrency list, Ethereum and Solana, continue to surge, chasing Bitcoin\u2019s rally. These projects are on the cusp of success, and the bullish market continues to rage despite volatility. NuggetRush is on a roll, leading the way with its resounding presale success.

        "content": "Whales began to sell their ETH holdings.\n\nPrice remained the same, and institutions started to show interest in ETHE.\n\nEthereum [ETH] price has been soaring upward over the last few weeks. Due to this, many holders that got in early, could try to sell their holdings for a profit.\n\nOne major whale had already started selling off its holdings.\n\nProfit taking season\n\nThe whale, proficient in the art of swing trading with Ethereum ETH, has recently initiated the selling of ETH. The whale has made a substantial deposit of 3,700 ETH (equivalent to $8.72 million) to the Binance platform.\n\nAt present, the whale holds a total of 10,000 ETH, amounting to $23.58 million in value.\n\nThe whale\u2019s strategic selling of Ethereum could impact the market in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, if the whale\u2019s actions lead to increased liquidity and more balanced price levels, it could contribute to a healthier and more stable ETH market.\n\nHowever, on the negative side, large transactions like these can also introduce volatility, potentially causing short-term price fluctuations and influencing investor sentiment.\n\nThe sell-offs were not isolated to one whale. Recent data showed that many top addresses on exchanges had seen a decline in their supply.\n\nHowever, despite the whale sell-offs, the overall price momentum of ETH wasn\u2019t affected. The price of ETH was $2,361.38, at the time of writing. Its price had grown by 0.41% in the last 24 hours.\n\nInstitutions remain keen\n\nHowever, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust premium gap, previously at -59.49% in December 2022, narrowed due to institutional buying, positively impacting ETH\u2019s trajectory.\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust premium gap refers to the difference between the market price of Ethereum (ETH) and the price at which the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) shares are valued.\n\nA negative premium indicates that ETHE shares are trading below the market value of ETH. In December 2022, the premium gap was at -59.49%, suggesting that ETHE shares were significantly undervalued compared to the actual price of ETH.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nThe narrowing of this premium gap is attributed to institutional buying, which means that institutional investors were acquiring ETHE shares.\n\nWhen institutions invest in trust products like Grayscale, it often reflects confidence in the underlying asset, in this case, Ethereum."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) saw a price pump as bulls regained control of the market and initiated a rally in the short run. The breakout above the $2,000 hurdle also provided the crypto with a lot of investor attention, and the price continued the momentum, which was supported by a decent buying volume.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) also saw a significant upswing as it made its way towards Stage 8 of its presale, fueled by interest in its disruptive blockchain technology implementation and AI-driven features. We will explore the opportunity for both cryptos and see how far they can climb.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Breaks Above $2,000 \u2013 To Reach $3,332.19 in Q1, 2024\n\nIn the past year, Ethereum (ETH) saw a total price upswing of 75%. During the previous seven days, ETH moved up in value from $2,201 to $2,384, and this growth occurred following the crypto\u2019s break above the $2,000 price barrier. Currently, the Ethereum market cap is at $266,955,902,567, while its trading volume is at $20,666,358,004.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on November 15 that following the SEC delaying the ETH futures ETF bid, he believes if they do approve the application, it will allow Grayscale to argue for the approval of the spot Ether ETF application. As a result, this pushed interest in the Ethereum crypto further and could lead it to new heights. Based on the Ethereum price prediction, it can reach $3,332.19 by the start of 2024.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Will Enable Fractional Ownership in Multi-Million Dollar Properties\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) will disrupt the $280 trillion real estate market through the introduction of blockchain elements that will tackle key issues in the industry. Historically, most people had trouble accessing the space due to the high costs of entry, as most properties would cost millions of dollars that needed to be paid upfront.\n\nAs a result, Everlodge will mint each property as an NFT and, afterward, will fractionalize them. This way, if a property is worth $5,000,000, it can get split into 50,000 pieces worth just $100 each. Holders of these fractions retain all of the benefits associated with property ownership, such as passive income from rental properties and value appreciation.\n\nThere will also be an AI tool that can predict future markets in which properties can explode in value, providing users with high ROI opportunities. A Rewards Club will be available where holders of the native crypto can get access to free nightly stays, and a Launchpad will be featured, where property builders can get funding from the community. As a result, anyone will be able to build a vast, diversified portfolio of properties and maximize their opportunities. All of these aspects make it the best new crypto to invest in.\n\nSummary\n\nWhile analysts are bullish on Ethereum\u2019s future, it will take some time for the crypto to reach the projected gains. Currently, the ELDG crypto is undergoing its crypto ICO phase and is at Stage 8, trading at just $0.027. With its recent momentum in mind, at launch, analysts are expecting a price upswing of 2,500%.\n\nFor more information about the ongoing Everlodge (ELDG) Presale, please visit their website."

This significant change is signaling a shift in the digital currency landscape. The transactional development between the two coin giants goes along with the growing excitement around Bitcoin Ordinals, which continues to captivate the crypto community's interest.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Makes Strides Amidst Ordinals Excitement\n\nBitcoin's price holds steady at $37,798.12, marking a 9.64% increase over the past month.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most valuable cryptos on the market, and both have been making significant gains in the past month. Bitcoin gained over 24%, while Ethereum gained just over 20%. It\u2019s clear that the crypto markets entered a bullish phase, but even with gains like these, a few platforms will likely outperform BTC and ETH in 2024.\n\nWhile the leading cryptos still offer impressive gains, their potential can\u2019t compare to emerging platforms such as Bitcoin ETF Token, Bitcoin Minetrix, and Meme Kombat. So, let\u2019s see what these cryptos offer up close to help you get the most out of your crypto investments in 2024 and beyond.\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nWhat\u2019s The Future of BTC and ETH?\n\nThe ongoing bull run for BTC and ETH has got investors far and wide excited for 2024. According to the price predictions, BTC could surpass $100,000 in 2024, reaching new all-time highs and practically doubling its current price. BTC gained over 120% in 2023, and the surge will likely continue in 2024 and even 2025.\n\nBTC is in a bull run primarily because of the rumors of introducing Bitcoin ETFs in the next few months. The official Bitcoin ETF application has been made, and everyone\u2019s eyes are on the SEC, which is expected to greenlight the trading shortly. If that were the case, traditional traders and financial experts would get access to trading BTC tokens without owning them, which would likely attract billions of dollars in capital. Ethereum is in the same situation, as Ethereum ETFs are also awaiting approval from the SEC. ETH is expected to surpass $4,500 in 2024, giving token holders about 100% returns.\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nTokens Better Than BTC and ETH\n\nAs mentioned above, BTC and ETH are expected to double in value in 2024. However, while those gains will set new records, they can\u2019t compare with the potential of the three latest platforms that entered presale recently. So, let\u2019s see why you should add them to your portfolio ASAP.\n\n1. Bitcoin ETF Token \u2013 Emerging Crypto Platform As a Flagship Offer for Bitcoin ETFs\n\nBitcoin ETF Token is one of the most exciting crypto platforms to enter presale in years. It arrived just as the first information about the SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin ETFs spread throughout the crypto and financial communities. Once Bitcoin ETFs are approved, traditional financial investors can buy and sell BTC tokens without owning them. That will, of course, spread BTC adoption and attract billions of dollars in capital.\n\nBitcoin ETF token will be the first cryptocurrency to allow investors to venture into the new market, giving them a significant advantage. Moreover, the platform is designed according to the best industry practices, with excellent tokenomics and a deflationary system. Namely, 5% of all BTCETF tokens sold during presale will be burned to reduce supply and increase value.\n\nThe official Bitcoin ETF Token presale is live and has raised over $3 million already. Around 25% of the entire supply has been sold so far, so hurry up and grab your BTCETF before they are sold. The token\u2019s price increases weekly, so the sooner you invest, the higher the returns you can expect.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin ETF Now<<<\n\n2. Bitcoin Minetrix \u2013 Bitcoin Cloud-Based Stake-to-Mine Platform with Massive Potential\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is another emerging crypto platform closely tied to the world\u2019s most valuable digital asset. It\u2019s a stake-to-mine crypto platform that allows users to mine Bitcoin in a highly efficient and eco-friendly way. Users can stake their BTCMTX tokens to earn mining credits they can use to rent remote mining rigs to earn BTC tokens. Bitcoin Minetrix is able to solve the biggest challenges of mining BTC, massive hardware and electricity costs in a single swoop.\n\nMoreover, community members and token holders can manage their mining process at all times using the complementary smartphone app, and they can withdraw their BTCMTX tokens directly to their wallets. The platform is entirely built on the Ethereum network, so BTCMTX tokens are ERC-20 coins you can transfer and sell on any crypto exchange.\n\nBTC will stay the most mined crypto worldwide for the next century. Since Bitcoin Minetrix allows users to participate in the mining remotely, it is a platform that will likely keep gaining value over time. BTCMTX tokens are available in a presale that raised over $5 million. Their price will increase weekly, so invest today to get the highest returns in 2024 and beyond.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\n3. Meme Kombat \u2013 Meme Coin Catering to Multiple Growing Industries with Impressive Rewards\n\nMeme Kombat is the latest addition to the meme coin market, but it offers a unique design that sets it apart from all other platforms in the niche. The project combines three multi-billion dollar industries \u2013 cryptocurrencies, gaming, and online casinos, creating a unique ecosystem with multiple reward systems.\n\nMeme Kombat is an AI-powered game where users can select their favorite online meme character and fight it against others in exciting arena battles. All battles are AI-managed, ensuring complete transparency and fairness.

        "title": "Why Does the Ethereum Network Get Congested? - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "What is Ethereum and why do we need it? Ethereum is the leading decentralized global computing network that can get congested, but why? In this guide, we explore why the Ethereum network gets congested.\n\nWhat is Ethereum\n\nEthereum is the leading decentralized global computing network, functioning as a platform for smart contracts and dApps built on blockchain technology. It is one of the most popular blockchain networks, responsible for the unprecedented Dogecoin price rise around a decade ago, and now home to several growing altcoins including USDC, USDT, LINK and, of course, ETH. However, its popularity has resulted in network congestion and scaling difficulties.\n\nEthereum is an open-source, decentralized blockchain-based platform that allows anyone to build and deploy permanent and immutable decentralized applications, known as dApps. It utilizes smart contracts, which are programmable transaction protocols that automatically execute when specific conditions are met. These smart contracts run exactly as programmed and are stored on and executed by the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEthereum has its own native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH) which is digital money that can be sent or received anywhere in the world. ETH is the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. It operates via a global peer-to-peer network that maintains a distributed ledger called the blockchain. The blockchain records all transactions taking place on the network. Developers can build and deploy decentralized applications on Ethereum using programming languages like Solidity and Vyper that compile into bytecode that is executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nEthereum was first proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin and went live in 2015. Since then, it has grown to become the most actively used blockchain, with the largest developer community working on the platform. The goal of Ethereum is to become a \u2018world computer\u2019 that replaces centralized intermediaries and runs decentralized applications, enabling censorship resistance, trust less transactions, and economic innovation on a global scale.\n\nCore Causes\n\nThere are a lot of elements of Ethereum that might be the cause of congestion, such as limitations of Proof-of-Work consensus. The PoW algorithm used does not efficiently scale as transaction volume increases. Block size and block time remains constant at capacity regardless of demand. The consensus algorithm does not scale well. Block size and block time is static regardless of transaction volume.\n\nAnd then there is a lack of native sharding. Unlike later generation blockchains, Ethereum 1.0 has no native sharding or parallelized transaction processing capabilities. This restricts TPS. More users and activity \u2013 As Ethereum has grown, more transactions like token swaps, DEX trades, NFT mints happen, filling blocks.\n\nThe gas auction model is also a factor. The use of gas fees auctioned via first-price auction means users bid up prices during high demand periods, further congesting the network.\n\nAdditionally, popular decentralized apps like CryptoKitties , decentralized exchanges, and DeFi protocols overload the network with transactions far exceeding baseline capacity. Games have clogged the network with transactions. DeFi apps also overload the network. Steadily increasing wallet addresses, daily active users and new dApps bring more total transactions over time as adoption grows.\n\nNFTs have also grown in popularity. In fact, you might say they exploded. This explosive growth of NFTs attached to digital items like profile pictures, artwork, collectibles minting millions of tokens on-chain causes bottlenecks.\n\nFinally, the ICO craze of 2017 congested Ethereum with token transactions, followed by their collapse which left abandoned dApps. The 2017/2018 ICO craze congested Ethereum with token transactions and drawn-out sales.\n\nHowever, these are accidental causes. There is also the purposeful clogging by hackers and spammers. Spammers intentionally clog up transaction capacity through attacks with unnecessary transactions and data. Attacks or abuse of cheap gas fees intentionally clog up bandwidth with unnecessary transactions.\n\nEffects of Congestion\n\nSo, what are the effects of this clogging? Why should we care?\n\nWell, for a start, average transaction confirmation times can go from minutes to hours during peak congestion periods and congestion can lead to significantly higher gas fees. Users are forced to overbid on gas prices to prioritize transactions, pricing out smaller users. Users compete through gas price auctions to get priority, driving up costs significantly.\n\nCongestion combined with gas price uncertainty leads users to set gas too low, causing TX failures. Transactions with lower gas fees may get rejected entirely when capacity limited.\n\nAdditionally, the overall user experience suffers due to delays, costs, and uncertainty during congestion. There are constrained capabilities because congestion limits the ability to scale dApps and overall network functionalities. This also affects scaling, since congestion limits practical use cases and dApp development on Ethereum.\n\nSolutions\n\nThere are a number of solutions that can be deployed to handle this congestion, like:\n\n\u2013 Layer 2 scaling: Solutions like roll ups and side chains move activity off-chain while leveraging Ethereum security.\n\n\u2013 Proof-of-Stake: Consensus upgrade to Proof-of-Stake aims to handle more transactions per second at lower costs. Consensus upgrade planned to increase transaction throughput and efficiency.\n\n\u2013 Sharding: Planned upgrade that parallelizes transaction processing across multiple chains to increase throughput.\n\n\u2013 Limiting blockchain bloat: Restricting certain NFT mints or identifying network spam transactions during congestion.\n\n\u2013 Allowing some failed transactions: This can relieve network capacity pressure during peak congestion.\n\n\u2013 Limiting blockchain bloat: Restricting certain activities like minting NFTs during peak congestion.\n\n\u2013 Higher gas fees: Increasing the minimum gas price helps reduce network abuse.\n\nConclusion\n\nManaging extreme congestion events while scaling Ethereum for the long-term with upgrades like Eth2 is critical to realizing its full potential. Ethereum\u2019s popularity has strained capacity limits. But network upgrades like Eth2 and new L2 solutions will help scale Ethereum to meet growing demand in the future. Careful management of congestion and gas fees is key for stability.\n\n."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Solana overtake Ethereum in the NFT market - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Ethereum, long revered as the forerunner in NFT trading, is facing stiff competition from unexpected quarters. Bitcoin and Solana are stepping up, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance with innovative offerings and surging trading volumes. This shift is not just a blip on the radar but a significant change, heralding a new era in the world of NFTs.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Ascendancy with Ordinal Inscriptions\n\nBitcoin has experienced a remarkable surge in its NFT trading, primarily driven by the growing popularity of ordinal inscriptions. These inscriptions allow users to mint assets resembling NFTs directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, offering a novel approach to digital collectible creation.\n\nOver the past month, this asset class has seen a staggering 500% increase in sales volume, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s figures for the same period. This surge is indicative of the market\u2019s appetite for innovative and cost-effective NFT minting methods.\n\nThe appeal of Bitcoin\u2019s ordinal inscriptions lies in their affordability and the uniqueness of having NFTs stored directly on the blockchain, unlike traditional methods where NFTs are often stored on decentralized servers like IPFS. This distinction has attracted a wider audience, expanding Bitcoin\u2019s footprint in the NFT market.\n\nSolana\u2019s Rising Tide in NFT Trading\n\nNot to be outdone, the Solana blockchain has carved out its niche, recording higher NFT trading volumes than Ethereum. This upswing is the result of a series of successful initiatives and partnerships within the network.\n\nA notable event was the liquid staking protocol Jito\u2019s airdrop, which distributed $165 million worth of tokens to users. This event coincided with a spike in Solana\u2019s NFT sales, processing nearly $15 million in transactions.\n\nThe increase in activity on Tensor, a Solana-based NFT marketplace, further underscores the network\u2019s growing influence. Speculations about potential airdrops have fueled this surge, with the \u201cTensorians\u201d collection topping the sales charts. This collection alone witnessed a 100% increase in sales volume over the past week.\n\nAmid these developments, the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection has been making waves with its online open-world game, Pudgy World Alpha, introduced at Art Basel Miami. This game allows players to control avatars resembling the penguin characters, with or without owning an NFT.\n\nThe collection\u2019s expansion into physical toys available at Walmart, each coming with a QR code for the game, exemplifies the innovative ways NFTs are bridging digital and physical worlds.\n\nThe rising interest in Bitcoin ordinals has led to a significant increase in the blockchain\u2019s mempool, reaching an all-time high. The mempool, where all unconfirmed transactions await validation, has become congested, leading to slower processing times and higher fees. This situation highlights the growing pains of a blockchain adapting to increased demand for its services.\n\nIn essence, the NFT market is witnessing a paradigm shift with Bitcoin and Solana challenging Ethereum\u2019s longstanding supremacy. This competition is fostering innovation, leading to new methods of NFT creation and trading."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nIn the ever-evolving realm of cryptocurrency, a bold claim emerges: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Retik Finance (RETIK) are destined to become the top 3 tokens in terms of market capitalization by 2024. While this prediction may seem audacious, a closer examination reveals compelling evidence supporting this potential future.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is the undeniable pioneer of the crypto space and remains a titan in the market. Its established reputation, limited supply, and growing institutional adoption solidify its position as a valuable store of value. As the world increasingly recognizes Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a hedge against inflation and a haven asset, its dominance is poised to continue.\n\nAlso, Ethereum is the powerhouse of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, and stands as the foundation for Web 3.0, the next evolution of the internet. Its robust ecosystem, vibrant community, and ongoing development efforts focused on scalability and efficiency solidify its position as a vital platform for the future of technology.\n\nFinally, Retik Finance is a rising star in the DeFi space.

This recognition stems from its finite supply, decentralized structure, and track record of price stability relative to other cryptocurrencies. Given these attributes, Bitcoin qualifies as one of the tokens poised to lead in terms of market capitalization in 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum offers a unique value proposition to investors. It goes beyond just being a digital currency, positioning itself as a platform for innovation and a gateway to the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nHowever, Ethereum offers a compelling value proposition to investors. Its diverse functionalities, strong network effects, potential for future growth, and ability to act as a hedge against inflation make it a worthy consideration for anyone seeking exposure to the exciting world of blockchain technology and decentralized finance.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s robust ecosystem, scalability potential, increasing institutional adoption, commitment to decentralization, and ongoing developments position it as a strong contender to be among the leading tokens in terms of market capitalization in 2024.\n\nConclusion:-\n\nIn conclusion, Retik Finance\u2019s early presale success, coupled with its innovative solutions addressing challenges in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, positions it as a standout candidate for the top token in terms of market capitalization in 2024.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\n*This article was paid for Cryptonomist did not write the article or test the platform."
