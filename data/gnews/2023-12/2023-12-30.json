The growth of Ethereum staking service Lido has raised concerns around economic centralization in Ethereum since the blockchain's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus.\n\nAside from other small changes, the core priorities of the Ethereum ecosystem remain the same from last year's outline. Vitalik declined to estimate a timeline for the changes to the ecosystem, though the changes are ordered roughly according to priority."

        "content": "Ethereum is out and Solana is in.\n\nEthereum, its mess of layer-2s and neverending scaling roadmap are doomed to be usurped by its younger \u201cmonolithic\u201d rival.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what the rabblers on X are saying.\n\nThe sagging ETH-to-BTC ratio surely isn\u2019t helping. Bitcoin has swelled 160% this year, while ETH hasn\u2019t even doubled. Anyone who sold their bitcoin for ether in January would\u2019ve so far lost a quarter of their BTC on that trade.\n\nSolana\u2019s bitcoin ratio is up more than 300%. SOL\u2019s dollar price is now 10 times what it was at the start of the year, although it\u2019s still down almost two-thirds from its record high at the top of the last bull market.\n\nSolana truthers would also point to the network\u2019s cheap fees and engaged community, which have lately inspired a boom in Solana-native NFTs, memecoins and decentralized exchanges. Solana even flipped Ethereum for DEX volume for the first time earlier this month.\n\nProjects are now plotting additional airdrops to incentivize on-chain Solana activity, hinting at far more buzz to come.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Vitalik fans.\n\nAn Ethereum vibecession may have given way to a Solanaissance, but these charts should pick up your spirits.\n\nEthereum\u2019s number has definitely gone up\n\nOne could sift through the minutiae of blockchain tech stacks \u2014 debate the finer points of the appchain thesis and the security concerns surrounding consensus. Or, we could just focus on price.\n\nEther\u2019s earliest recorded price was $3 when it opened trade way back in 2015. ETH now trades for $2,300 \u2014 a 76,000% return over its whole history (not counting the additional gains made on its ICO price).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s all-time returns would completely dwarf ether\u2019s and solana\u2019s. Let\u2019s just pretend they wouldn\u2019t\n\nSolana has done well but not that well, posting a meager 40,000% since its debut in mid-2020, about half ether\u2019s returns.\n\nAnd we all know that markets are always right.\n\nEvery second dollar locked is on Ethereum\n\nCrypto has so many use cases. You can buy other cryptocurrencies with it. You can buy NFTs with it, and maybe some Dallas Mavericks merchandise.\n\nYou can even buy movie tickets or Adidas shoes with crypto \u2014 although you\u2019ll have to send your bitcoin to a payment processor who will dump it for fiat on behalf of the merchant.\n\nIf using crypto as actual money doesn\u2019t appeal, you could always lock it up in a blockchain and earn yield on it. Maybe even lend it out to other people who might buy other cryptocurrencies with it.\n\nEven Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum has more TVL than Solana\n\nThere\u2019s about $53 billion in crypto locked up in DeFi protocols, and more than half of that is on Ethereum. Only 2.6% is staked with Solana platforms, equal to about $1.4 billion.\n\nTVL gets a bad rap by those who say it doesn\u2019t properly reflect how people interact with competing blockchains. Ignore them, they\u2019re probably Solana fans.\n\nUsers pay more to use Ethereum (a good thing)\n\nWe get it, there are cheaper blockchains to use than Ethereum. Solana is one of them.\n\nLow fees are great for anyone who wants to wash trade NFTs and memecoins, but they\u2019re not so great if you want people to actually make money by contributing to the network.\n\nEthereum users have paid more than $2.3 billion to use the blockchain this year. Over on Solana, users have forked out less than $20 million \u2014 under 1% of Ethereum fees.\n\nEven ignoring Ethereum, crypto users have paid way more to use Bitcoin and Tron than Solana\n\nGranted, Ethereum fees don\u2019t go directly to validators anymore, they\u2019re instead burned to reduce the supply, which, in a roundabout way, benefits all ETH holders.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, subsidizes the network\u2019s low fees by printing tokens, effectively penalizing all SOL holders with inflation.\n\nActive addresses and where to find them\n\nUntil we all scan our eyeballs with the Worldcoin orb and blend our biometrics with the blockchain, nailing down exactly how many people really use crypto is practically impossible.\n\nAll that shouldn\u2019t get in the way of pretending.\n\nAdding up the cumulative number of active addresses every day this year across 29 different blockchains shows Ethereum, Solana and even Bitcoin aren\u2019t even the most popular chains.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling how many of these are unique individuals. Whatever, big numbers are good numbers\n\nThe cumulative daily active addresses for Justin Sun\u2019s Tron is almost 600 million. Binance\u2019s BNB Chain has attracted more than three times the active addresses of Solana.\n\nEthereum mainnet\u2019s count is only slightly ahead of Solana\u2019s, but including layer-2s like zkSync Era, Arbitrum and Optimism gives more than 300 million.\n\nEthereum against the world (wide web 2.0)\n\nCrypto market caps are terribly inaccurate. They\u2019re easily gamed, never take lost supplies into account and hardly ever reflect the real liquidity of the underlying token.\n\nThis often results in valuations far higher than what could be realistically extracted from the market itself. Sounds bad, but most of that can be also said of market capitalizations for stocks.\n\nIn any case, if Ethereum was a stock, with which industries would it compete?\n\nSure, comparing crypto to stocks is apples to oranges. It still feels right\n\nEthereum\u2019s whole \u201cworld computer\u201d shtick could force it alongside cloud stocks like Amazon, Cisco and IBM. The network\u2019s power to process stablecoin payments would otherwise put it against PayPal, Visa and Mastercard.\n\nWell, Ethereum\u2019s market cap, averaged out over the past six months, is three times PayPal\u2019s and seven times more than the stock valuation of Cash App creator Block (formerly Square).\n\nSolana\u2019s current market cap is now above Block\u2019s, but its average since June is lower than all of them.\n\nDavid is an Editor based in the Netherlands focused on data-driven journalism.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has revealed an ambitious roadmap for the development of the Ethereum blockchain in 2024.\n\nIn a series of posts on X Saturday, Buterin detailed the strategic goals that will shape Ethereum\u2019s development landscape in the coming months. Notably, the roadmap, which resembles the previous year\u2019s plan, reflects Ethereum\u2019s commitment to consistent development.\n\nButerin highlighted six core components guiding Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in 2024, namely the merge, the surge, the scourge, the verge, the purge, and the splurge. These components were accompanied by detailed explanations and graphics, offering the community a transparent insight into Ethereum\u2019s strategic priorities.\n\nAt the heart of this roadmap lies \u201cthe Merge,\u201d a pivotal element executed in September 2022. Notably, the successful execution of the Merge marked a momentous shift from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus to the more sustainable PoS consensus mechanism, significantly reducing Ethereum\u2019s overall energy consumption.\n\nButerin disclosed plans to advance Ethereum\u2019s Single Slot Finality (SSF) in 2024. This feature is designed to ensure irreversible changes to blockchain blocks, requiring burning at least 33% of the total staked ETH for any attempts at reversal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSingle slot finality (SSF) is emerging as a clear solution to address several of the current shortcomings in Ethereum\u2019s PoS design,\u201d said Buterin.\n\nUnder \u201cThe Surge,\u201d Buterin set an ambitious goal of achieving 100,000 transactions per second on the Ethereum network through the implementation of rollups. This enhancement is poised to significantly boost the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain, addressing a long-standing challenge faced by the platform.\n\nFurther, in tackling centralization risks within Ethereum\u2019s PoS design, Buterin introduced \u201cThe Scourge,\u201d focusing on mitigating concerns related to Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and liquid staking. This aligns with Buterin\u2019s commitment to maintaining a decentralized and secure network, emphasizing the importance of a robust and trustworthy blockchain ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThe Verge\u201d is another crucial element in the roadmap, with Buterin aiming to simplify block verification processes. This streamlining is expected to enhance efficiency and reduce potential bottlenecks within the system, further contributing to Ethereum\u2019s overall performance.\n\nButerin\u2019s commentary aligned with a Friday tweet that suggested his intent to revive blockchain technology\u2019s original \u201ccypherpunk\u201d ethos. The term \u201ccypherpunk\u201d refers to individuals advocating for privacy using cryptography, especially against government surveillance.\n\nIn a reflective blog post, Buterin discussed Ethereum\u2019s initial conception as a \u201cpublic decentralized shared hard drive.\u201d He highlighted the platform\u2019s roots in peer-to-peer communication and decentralized file storage. However, Buterin acknowledged a shift in Ethereum\u2019s direction in 2017, with a growing focus on financial applications.\n\nThat said, as Ethereum steers towards a future defined by sustainable consensus mechanisms and a renewed commitment to privacy, the community eagerly awaits the unfolding of these strategic goals throughout 2024."

This vision, centered on decentralized applications, privacy protection, and peer-to-peer communication, has been somewhat overshadowed by the network\u2019s growing focus on DeFi and other financial applications.\n\nIntegrating rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, and other privacy-enhancing technologies is a step towards restoring this cypherpunk ethos. These advancements could enable developers to create more private and censorship-resistant applications on Ethereum.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile addressing security vulnerabilities is a priority, the transition phase, particularly during the Merge, might expose the network to temporary security vulnerabilities or attacks.\n\nRemoving outdated code and implementing new enhancements could pose compatibility issues for existing applications.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, it is crucial to remember the principles that inspired its creation. By embracing privacy protection, decentralization, and peer-to-peer communication, Ethereum can reclaim its cypherpunk roots and become a true force for positive change in the digital world.\n\nTo learn more about Vitalik Buterin\u2019s proposals to enhance Ethereum\u2019s network efficiency, read here:\n\nVitalik Proposes 3 Paths to Enhance ETH Network Efficiency\n\n\n\nTo delve into the details of Trump\u2019s sale of $2.5M ETH following disappointing Mugshot NFT sales, read here:\n\nTrump Sells $2.5M ETH Upon Disappointing Mugshot NFT Sales"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, an Ethereum whale has recently made a huge purchase of 25,674 ETH; however, this action could backfire if the price of ETH falls below a specific threshold, triggering a liquidation event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom all indications, it appears that the whale obtained the said ETH from MakerDAO. This decentralized lending platform allows users to mint stablecoins (DAI) by locking up their crypto assets as collateral.\n\nWhen the price of $ETH drops to $2,257, the smart money will be in danger of liquidation.\n\n\n\nThe healthy ratio on #Maker is as low as 1.03.\n\n\n\nThe smart money once again spent 61M $DAI to buy 25,674 $ETH, and then sold 5,851 $ETH for 14M $DAI, making ~$99K.https://t.co/yGkFI6qpnj pic.twitter.com/VRmstUCngE \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 29, 2023\n\nLookonchain reports that the whale had spent 61 million DAI to buy 25,674 ETH; however, the whale shortly after sold 5,851 ETH out of this stash for a value of 14 million DAI, of which they made a profit of $99,000.\n\nAlthough the whale had made some profits from this strategy, they also faced the risk of liquidation. If the ETH price goes below a certain level, the whale's collateral will be insufficient to cover their debt, and MakerDAO will automatically liquidate the ETH to reclaim the DAI.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, if the price of ETH drops to $2,257, the said large ETH holder might be in danger of liquidation. This is because the healthy ratio on MakerDAO is presently as low as 1.03.\n\nThe Ethereum price is nearing this threshold, having fallen 3.56% in the last 24 hours to trade at $2,280, according to CoinMarketCap data. Since reaching a high of $2,448 on Dec. 28, the price of Ethereum has steadily dropped.\n\nIf today closes in red, ETH might be set to mark its third consecutive day of losses. The ETH price fell to intraday lows of $2,255 on Dec. 29, but at present, it has held up above the lows of $2,267 marked in today's trading session.\n\nWherever ETH price trends, the whale's fate is now related to the performance of ETH and the crypto market as a whole, which is currently declining as investors book profits through the end of 2023."

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nThe Ethereum price was on its way to reach the upper resistance above $2500, but the bears held back just below $2400. After making repetitive attempts to rise above the ascending trend line, the ETH price formed a clear bearish pattern. This may not be in favour of the bulls, as the selling pressure has accumulated to a large extent at the moment.\n\nThe second-largest crypto has a string of reversal indications that forecast a bearish price action. Despite the prevailing bearish claws, the ETH price appears to be preparing itself well for a bullish monthly close, and hence begins the fresh yearly trade above $2300 to $2350. However, the current trade setup suggests a bullish reversal may be on the horizon.\n\nEver since the price flipped from the lower support during October, the rally has maintained an ascending trend to mark the highs around $2,446. Despite this, the token failed to rise above the trend line that could have lifted the levels to close to $2,500. However, the fresh price action, which is the continuation of the previous bearish trend, suggests a rebound could be imminent.\n\nBesides, the DMI is going bearish as the ADX has plunged and the other signal lines are about to undergo a bearish cross-over. Therefore, the Ethereum (ETH) price may print another couple of bearish candles to test the lower support at around $2,179, which may trigger a healthy rebound. However, the bullish strength could be a major concern, as the price may begin with a fresh upswing only if it makes its way above the ascending trend line that has been a major resistance level."

This element was highlighted in 2022 when it led to the integration of the Ethereum mainnet and the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake blockchain.\n\nFollowing this integration, Ethereum transitioned from a power-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to PoS, significantly reducing the network\u2019s overall energy consumption.\n\nThe roadmap also highlighted Ethereum\u2019s focus on single-slot finality (SSF), a concept designed to ensure that changes to blocks on a blockchain cannot be reversed without burning at least 33% of the total staked ETH.\n\nButerin also detailed how the Scourge priority would become more focused on combating economic centralization in Ethereum, particularly regarding MEV and liquid stake pooling.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin pitches 3 pathways to simplify Ethereum\u2019s PoS model\n\nButerin to make ETH cypherpunk again\n\nRecently, as reported by crypto.news, Buterin shared plans to reincorporate the original principles of the \u201ccypherpunk\u201d revolution into blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum CEO originally envisioned the network as a universally accessible, decentralized hard drive utilizing peer-to-peer communication and file storage. However, starting in 2017, Ethereum\u2019s focus began to shift toward financial applications, according to Buterin.\n\nIn the future, he hopes to revive the quintessential \u201ccypherpunk\u201d ideals, such as decentralization, open participation, resistance to censorship, and trustworthiness.\n\nButerin also noted that recent advancements like rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and second-generation privacy solutions align well with Ethereum\u2019s original values.\n\nDespite minor setbacks and challenges, his updated 2024 vision for Ethereum points towards an optimistic future, with analysts like Raoul Pal forecasting a potential price rise for ETH of up to $5,300.\n\nETH price to blow in 2024?\n\nFrom Pal\u2019s perspective, Ethereum\u2019s price is poised for a significant uptrend. It isn\u2019t a random prediction\u2014Pal has grounded it in the liquidity indicator, a key tool that analysts leverage to forecast the potential price shifts of assets.\n\nWhile the Real Vision co-founder injected a note of caution, reminding crypto investors that his forecasts aren\u2019t guaranteed, he exhibited an undeniable bullish outlook for Ethereum.\n\nPal further pointed out the potential impact of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Ethereum\u2019s progress. He postulated that the introduction of a Bitcoin spot ETF could set the stage for an Ethereum ETF, revitalizing the Ethereum ecosystem in the process.\n\nPal\u2019s outlook was shared by analysts at CryptosRUs, who predicted a surge in ETH\u2019s growth starting in Q1 2024.\n\nOver the past few weeks, we have seen rotations of capital through several crypto ecosystems, including #CosmosEcosystem , #Solana, #Injective, #BRC20s, and #Avalanche.\n\n\n\nIn today's #analysis, I am going to explain why I believe Ethereum will be the next ecosystem to see explosive\u2026 pic.twitter.com/XdFxqzkbUP \u2014 CryptosRUs Analysis (@CRUAnalysis) December 26, 2023\n\nAccording to the analysts, ETH\u2019s upward trajectory will be fueled by factors such as positive market sentiment, the seasonality of ETH and Bitcoin (BTC), and the forthcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nIn November, IntoTheBlock reported that over 75% of Ethereum addresses were profitable at a time when ETH was priced at $2,200. The market intelligence platform also stated that only about 22.5% of Ethereum addresses experienced unrealized losses, with close to 1.17% at the break-even point.\n\nEthereum\u2019s network activity also saw significant rises, with the number of new addresses on the network spiking by about 17.5% and active addresses seeing a boost of roughly 23%.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum addresses without ETH balances also surged by around 74%, while the number of Ethereum addresses with ETH balances is on a steadily ascending trajectory.\n\nOver the past 30 days, the average count of Ethereum addresses was approximately 102.72 million\u2014more than double the number for Bitcoin.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Kraken, which was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month for deceptive practices, grabbed the fourth spot, with ETH holdings of roughly 1.6 million.\n\nPopular trading platform, Robinhood is fifth on the list. At the time of writing, it had more than 1.4 million ETH under its belly, which loosely translates to about 1.24% of all ETH tokens in circulation.\n\nNotably, two other wallet addresses in the top 10 \u2014 each holding more than 550,000 ETH \u2014 are linked to crypto exchange giant Binance. Rounding off the top 10 are Arbitrum: Bridge, with holdings of over 1.3 million, and Bitfinex, with more than 450,000 ETH.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that an ETH address linked to Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of Ethereum, named VB 3, holds more than 240,000 ETH."

        "content": "The Ethereum Layer 2 transactions skyrocketed by over 330% in 2023 compared to the last year. In recent months, Ethereum\u2019s scaling solutions have experienced a notable uptick in interest, marked by the frequent introduction of new Layer 2s (L2s).\n\nOne of the latest players in this dynamic landscape is Coinbase\u2019s Base L2, which gripped the attention of crypto enthusiasts. While Base had a significant share in these transactions, Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) emerged as the largest contributors.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum L2 Transactions Overview\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock analytics, the Ethereum L2 ecosystem recorded a total of 583.53 million transactions in 2023. This suggests a staggering increase of 332.08% from 2022\u2019s figure of 135.05 million. The largest contribution in the 2023 transactions was made by Arbitrum which accounted for a 64.01% share.\n\nOn the other hand, Optimism and Base held a share of 22.22% and 13.77% share, respectively. Furthermore, it\u2019s worth noting that the 2023 Ethereum L2 transaction data indicates an unprecedented growth from 2021. Since the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem was fairly new in 2021, the number of transactions was recorded to be 6.24 million, which indicates a whopping increase of 9,251% since then.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price: Analyst Predicts 22% Surge In Ethereum (ETH) Price Sparking Market Optimism\n\nFurthermore, in a recent post on X, IntoTheBlock highlighted that the weekly transactions since 2021 have increased by 90 times.

In the past seven days, the ARB price locked in profits of over 8% while OP surged by 13%. In addition, the ARB crypto soared by more than 43% in the past month whereas OP skyrocketed by 117%.\n\nHowever, at the time of writing, both these digital assets saw a significant drop in value due to the ongoing bearish trend of the market. At press time, the ARB price was recorded at $1.45, plunging by 5.56%. The ARB market cap stood at $1.84 billion, down by 5.72%. Moreover, the 24-hour trade volume slumped by 23.54% to $617.02 million.\n\nWhilst, the OP crypto price dipped by 2.41% to $3.65. The crypto\u2019s market cap was recorded at $3.32 billion, marking a decline of 2.43%. However, the 24-hour trade volume registered a significant increase of 11.73% to 589.94 million.\n\nAlso Read: Optimism And Immutable Price Rally Continues With Monthly Gains Of Over 75%"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nWith Ethereum transaction activities increasingly shifting to Layer 2 (L2) networks, the ecosystem is bracing for a potential new bull run, one that could be predominantly led by these L2 platforms like Arbitrum and Optimism. The surge in L2 transactions, which have grown by an astounding 90 times since 2021, paints a clear picture: The next wave of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and meme coins is likely to be rooted in these scalable networks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe main network layer of Ethereum has faced significant challenges in scaling to meet the demands of its growing user base and application field. High gas fees and network congestion have highlighted the limitations of the current infrastructure, making the need for efficient L2 solutions more pressing than ever. These L2 networks are designed to offload the burden from the Ethereum mainnet, offering faster transactions and lower fees, making them an attractive alternative for developers.\n\nETH/USD chart by TradingView\n\nThis shift toward L2 networks does not just represent a stop-gap solution but is becoming integral to Ethereum's future. It is reasonable to expect that the initial signs of a rally within the Ethereum ecosystem will emerge on these scalable platforms. They are set to be the breeding ground for innovation and the go-to space for new projects in DeFi, NFTs and beyond.\n\nThe new Ethereum road map, as outlined by Vitalik Buterin, underscores this transition. Key updates to the road map include the solidification of single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge proof of stake (PoS) improvements, which aims to enhance the efficiency and security of the network. Buterin has also highlighted the importance of cross-rollup standards and interoperability as areas requiring long-term development. These would enable seamless communication and transaction execution across different L2 solutions, furthering the composability of the ecosystem.\n\nFurther developments such as the redesign of The Scourge, the nearing readiness of Verkle trees for inclusion, and the shrinking of \"state expiry\" to reflect a broader consensus show a commitment to continuous improvement. Additions like deep cryptography, including obfuscation and delay-encrypted mempools, suggest a forward-looking approach to security and privacy within the network."

These updates are part of Ethereum's ongoing effort to bolster network security and optimize its protocol for a more efficient system.\n\nCombating centralization in PoS\n\nIn the realm of PoS, centralization can create vulnerabilities and unfair advantages, an issue Buterin is tackling head-on.\n\nThe updated \"The Scourge\" phase targets MEV, which refers to the maximum value that miners can extract from block production beyond the standard block rewards and gas fees. This practice can lead to centralization as it favors larger players with more resources.\n\nButerin's strategy involves exploring new MEV mechanics and distributing blocks to mitigate these risks. Additionally, the road map addresses stake pooling issues by considering revised staking economics and validator experience improvements, which could lead to a more decentralized and secure network.\n\nInnovations in data storage and efficiency\n\nProgress in the \"The Verge\" phase signifies a significant step toward integrating Verkle trees, a data structure that promises to optimize storage and increase transaction efficiency on the Ethereum network. This move aligns with the broader goal of scalability and performance enhancement.\n\nFurthermore, the plan reflects a community consensus to deprioritize \"state expiry,\" recognizing the potential of stateless clients and other innovations to manage blockchain state more effectively.\n\nThese developments represent a deliberate and methodical approach to Ethereum's evolution, with an emphasis on timely and incremental improvements rather than waiting for large-scale overhauls."

The value's growth confirms a relevant market thesis: Ethereum is still in the accumulation mode, despite the relatively weak market performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \"Hodler Ratio\" chart indicates that the percentage of Ethereum holders committed to holding their assets for the long term has seen a steady increase, now surpassing that of Bitcoin. This metric is crucial as it demonstrates the trust that investors place in the network's future.\n\n2023 Review! This year, the percent of long-term $ETH holders surpassed that of Bitcoin for the second time ever! pic.twitter.com/i6kDzAjzgM \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 30, 2023\n\nEthereum's ability to surpass Bitcoin in the percentage of long-term holders can be attributed to several factors. The continuous development of the Ethereum network, including the new road map and the growing ecosystem on Layer 2 networks, boosted investor confidence. Furthermore, the majority of investors believe that Ethereum is still lagging behind and has not yet shown its true market potential.\n\nHowever, a high percentage of long-term holders can present a double-edged sword for a network's performance. While it indicates trust and a long-term vision, it can also lead to reduced liquidity and potentially hinder short-term price performance. In the accumulation phase, this is typically seen as positive; it suggests that investors are accumulating and holding, which could drive up prices in the future due to reduced supply.\n\nDespite this positive sentiment among holders, Ethereum's price performance is still trailing behind some of its peers. This may be due to a variety of factors, including market cycles and the broader economic environment affecting risk assets.\n\nYet, the traction on Ethereum's Layer 2 networks provides a silver lining. The increase in activity and the scaling solutions offered by these networks are enhancing Ethereum's usability and could serve as catalysts for future growth. The rise of Layer 2 solutions is key to Ethereum's ability to handle increased transaction throughput, reduce fees and improve the overall user experience."

        "content": "After $11 billion in annual options delivery on Friday, Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to close the year below $44,000 and $2400 levels. As BTC and ETH continued to rally this year due to rising open interests (OI), a record rise in funding rates stalled the rally at the end of the year.\n\nBTC price rallied 170% and ETH price leaped 105% this year. Experts anticipate further rally after the funding rates decline gradually.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum OI and Funding Rates\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum futures open interest (OI) fell after Friday\u2019s expiry and recent crypto market selloffs this week. However, traders remain positive on further upsides.\n\nAs per current data, the total Bitcoin futures OI on all exchanges is over $18 billion. BTC OI on CME and Binance are $4.81 billion and $4.31 billion, rising again after the recent wipe out. Deribit, Coinbase, Bybit, OKX, and others have similar figures.\n\nThe total Ethereum futures OI is $3.36 million. ETH OI on the top three futures crypto exchanges Binance, Bybit, and OKX are rising after a massive drop.\n\nCrypto influencer Kamikaz shared that OI is totally wiped on BTC and ETH after expiry but funding remains higher as people are scared to short due to spot Bitcoin ETF approval sentiment. He says it is super bullish and wants to long.\n\nPopular analyst CredibleCrypto agreed with Kamikaz that the market is bullish. He explained that people are mistaking high funding rates for an excess of over-leveraged participants. In reality, OI is completely wiped at levels not witnessed in the last few years. He said, \u201cfunding is only relatively high because the few that are levered are predominantly directional longs.\u201d\n\nFunding rates are also actually falling from the record high. The BTC OI-weighted funding rate chart indicates probability of upside movement in the next few days.\n\nAlso Read:"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market appears to have lost its Christmas cheer. Major tokens \u2014 including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP \u2014 ended lower than their previous close on Friday. The slump in prices comes amid increasing volatility in the market.\n\nHowever, this could change as optimism grows that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would give its blessing to a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) before Jan 10, 2024. The dip in the crypto market can be partially attributed to the inactivity of whales and investors, who might have taken a week off for the holidays.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAll major cryptocurrencies were swimming in the red on Saturday, with the OG token Bitcoin price sliding by 1.6% to $42,030 per bitcoin. Interestingly, the 24-hour trading volume was up by 0.7% at $23.7 billion. Notably, Bitcoin has appreciated 10% in the last 30 days and is up 153% year-to-date.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum price fell more than 2% to $2,300 levels. Its trading volume over the last 24 hours plummeted by more than 25% to $10.94 billion.\n\nOther major tokens also recorded losses in the last 24 hours. While Tether price (USDT) fell 0.04% to $1, BNB price stood at $317.22 as of writing, down 1.31% in the last 24 hours. Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) slipped by 0.84%, 1.46%, and 1.29% respectively.\n\nThe dip in the prices of major tokens was reflected in the overall crypto market cap, which tumbled 1.37% in the last 24 hours to $1.65 trillion, with the 24-hour trading volume crashing more than 17% to $64.36 billion.\n\nHere Are The Top Cryptos For Today\n\nPepe Coin Plummets 14.5%\n\nAt press time, Pepe Coin (PEPE) price stood at $0.0000000003078, with the token having depreciated by nearly 14.5% in the last 24 hours. However, the 24-hour trading volume was up 0.67% to $2,186. In the last seven days, the cryptocurrency has recorded marginal losses of nearly 0.27%.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Drops 5%\n\nLitecoin (LTC) last changed hands at $73.22, down 5.2% in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume over the last 24 hours fell by nearly 24% to $460 million. Despite the recent market volatility, the altcoin has appreciated more than 4% in the last 30 days.\n\nORDI Rallies Nearly 7%\n\nDefying the recent market pullback, ORDI Price was up nearly 6% in the last 24 hours, with the token trading at %78.12 at press time. The 24-hour trading volume surged by a whopping 79% to $955.83 million. In the last seven days alone, the ORDI token has appreciated to the tune of 58%, potentially due to the recent Bitcoin bull run.\n\nAlso Read: Will Bitcoin Propel ETF Trading Beyond $38 Trillion in 2024?"

        "content": "ETH may fall to $2,215 as large sell-off spreads.\n\nTraders are confident that the altcoin will recover in no time.\n\nAccording to Whale Alert, a whale sent 14,610 Ethereum [ETH] tokens to the Coinbase exchange on the 30th of December. The transaction was the second one within 12 hours after an initial transfer involving 9,991 ETH.\n\nAs of this writing, the value of the transaction was worth $33.50 million. The move is a sign that the altcoin might be at risk of selling pressure.\n\nIf the cryptocurrency keeps experiencing a high inflow into exchanges, then the price could drop from $2,220.\n\nInterestingly, the last week of 2023 has given the ETH a turnaround. On the 28th of December, the value of ETH hit $2,415 as AMBCrypto reported.\n\nThis increase gave the Ethereum community a glimmer of hope that the ETH price season to shine was close.\n\nNo backing down on the potential\n\nHowever, the past few days indicated that ETH holders might need to wait a little longer for an extended rally. But what do traders think of the price action?\n\nAMBCrypto analyzed ETH\u2019s funding rate via the crypto analysis tool Santiment.\n\nFunding rates show if long are paying a funding fee to shorts. It also indicates if it\u2019s the other way around. If the Funding Rate is positive, then most traders are bullish. Also, a negative Funding Rate suggests more short positions than longs.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s Funding Rate was 0.031%. This reading suggested that traders were bullish on the price at press time.\n\nAnother metric to consider in assessing market perception toward ETH is the Weighted Sentiment. From the chart above, the Weighted Sentiment had dropped from 2.47 to 0.48.\n\nThe decline suggested the broader market was being careful in betting on the Ethereum native cryptocurrency.\n\nETH eyes another downturn\n\nRegarding the Open Interest, Coinglass showed that the indicator had risen to $8.40 billion. Open Interest measures market sentiment and strength behind price trends.\n\nSo, the increase means that money was flowing into contracts related to ETH. However, it could also be a sign of strength for the downward trend ETH\u2019s price was going through.\n\nFrom the ETH/USD 4-hour chart, the altcoin had felt the impact of the sell-offs as the price decreased to $2,290. A look at the Awesome Oscillator (AO) also showed that the momentum around the coin was bearish.\n\nAt the time of writing, the AO was -10.45.\n\nShould the indicator remain that way, then ETH\u2019s price might plunge further. Another indicator to consider was the Fibonacci Retracement. At press time, the 0.786 Fib Retracement level was at $2,215.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThis position indicated that ETH might drop to the region as long as selling pressure remained.\n\nHowever, $2,215 could be a good entry. This is because ETH has the potential to rebound, since the price was a previous support level for the altcoin."

        "title": "Top Five Altcoins To Watch In January: Solana (SOL), Bonk (BONK), Injective (INJ), Ethereum (ETH) And Chainlink (LINK) Might Dominate - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nThis year witnessed a significant growth in the crypto market, with its total cap doubling. Starting from a low point of $800 billion, the market cap recently peaked at $1.7 trillion, marking the highest level since early May 2022, nearly 20 months prior. Interestingly, this surge is not mainly driven by Bitcoin, as seen in recent times, but rather by emerging altcoins, several of which have experienced massive double-digit gains. Consequently, based on their performance in 2023, we have selected the top five altcoins that are expected to lead the market in January.\n\nAltcoin Market Dominance Touches A High\n\nDecember has seen a strong upward trend in the market, with numerous altcoins reaching new highs for the year. However, Bitcoin has struggled to make significant gains, facing strong resistance at the $45K mark. The continuous defense by sellers against a rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price has paved the bullish way for many altcoins, which are capitalizing on the situation with increased demand and massive double-digit price gains.\n\nNotably, the market dominance of altcoins, excluding the top 10, reached a high for 2023 in December, peaking at 13.5%. Additionally, the market capitalization, excluding Bitcoin, soared to a 1.5-year high of $815 billion. With the upcoming ETF decision in January, investors are showing a growing interest in highly volatile altcoins, aiming to maximize their returns.\n\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\n\nSolana recently faced a rejection above the $110 mark and declined below the EMA20 trend line on the 4-hour price chart. However, SOL price might soon trigger a rebound from the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, priced at $93.\n\nIf successful, this might suggest that market sentiment is still bullish, with traders actively buying during price dips. In such a case, SOL price might aim to break its resistance at $125 in January. A bullish breakout might send the price to hover around $160.\n\nBonk (BONK) Price Analysis\n\nBonk price has seen its price correct to a critical support level at $0.0000123, making it a key focus for traders and investors. However, bulls are aiming for a recovery above the EMA20 trend line.\n\nShould the bulls successfully defend this support level, there\u2019s a chance for a relief rally to start. In such a scenario, the BONK might consolidate above $0.000019 for the next few days.\n\nIn January, BONK price might surge to breach its resistance at $0.000035 and begin 2024 on a bullish note.\n\nInjective (INJ) Price Analysis\n\nThe price of INJ has shown remarkable performance this year, registering an impressive gain of over 2700%. At present, the price is facing a challenge from sellers at the immediate support level of $34. Despite this, buyers are actively preventing a drop below the moving averages, showing strong defense.\n\nLooking ahead to the upcoming week, there\u2019s potential for the INJ price to approach its resistance level at $45. Should it manage to break through this level, there\u2019s a possibility that buyers could drive the price to reach a new all-time high for 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\n\nEther price is currently hovering within the pattern\u2019s resistance and support of $2,500 and $2,300, respectively. However, resistance from sellers is strong around the $2,400 mark, leading to a pullback below the EMA20 trend line. Bulls aim to defend the ascending support line ahead of SEC\u2019s ETF decision.\n\nShould the bulls succeed in this, the ETH price might continue its upward trajectory, targeting around $2,500. A bullish news from the SEC in January might skyrocket the ETH price toward $3K.\n\nChainlink (LINK) Price Analysis\n\nChainlink\u2019s recent decline might be a profitable opportunity for buyers to accumulate more ahead of 2024\u2019s bull run. Sellers rejected a move above $18 and LINK price is on a heavy decline, aiming to trigger a wave of selling pressure.\n\nHowever, as the market sentiment remains positive in anticipation of SEC\u2019s decision, LINK price\u2019s decline might not get intensified. As a result, buyers might enter again near the dip of $14.5 and initiate a recovery to challenge the resistance zone of $17-$20 again in January."

        "content": "What\u2019s Behind Solana\u2019s Recent Surge\n\nSolana Flipped Ethereum in Google Search Interest\n\nGoogle searches for the term \"Solana\" surpassed \"Ethereum\" for the first time in 2023, indicating growing interest in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nFrom December 17 to 23, Solana's search interest score reached 56, while Ethereum's was 50. Google Trends data suggests that Solana's search interest is set to peak during the week of December 24 to 30, with a score of 100.\n\nUsers searching for Solana also showed interest in terms like \"bonk\" and \"tensor.\" Bonk (BONK) is the leading Solana memecoin that reached a peak market cap of $1.9 billion after being listed on Binance and Coinbase, while Tensor is the leading NFT marketplace on Solana, after surpassing Magic Eden in trading volume.\n\nSolana\u2019s DEX Volumes and NFT Sales Surpassed Ethereum\u2019s\n\nOn December 23, Solana surpassed Ethereum in weekly decentralized exchange (DEX) volume and non-fungible token (NFT) sales.\n\nDEX volume on Solana surged to over $10 billion, surpassing Ethereum's $8.8 billion for that week. Meanwhile, Solana also processed $109 million in NFT sales in that week, eclipsing Ethereum by $30 million.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is leading in terms of DEX volumes, with $10.12 billion compared to Solana\u2019s $8.71 billion. However, Solana\u2019s NFT sales volume is still ahead of Ethereum\u2019s, although Bitcoin is leading due to the recent Ordinals frenzy.\n\nThe current frenzy on Solana is partly driven by memecoins, particularly BONK, which has skyrocketed by 300% in December and has a market cap of over $1 billion. Another Solana-based memecoin, Dogwifhat, has also gained 428% in the past week.\n\nSolana Flipped BNB in Market Cap Momentarily\n\nOn December 22, Solana surged by 18% to overtake BNB (BNB), propelling it to 4th place in terms of market capitalization. SOL traded at a market cap of $41.9 billion, surpassing BNB, which had a market cap of $41.8 billion.\n\nThis surge came after SOL overtook XRP in market cap on December 21. However, BNB has since regained its position after gaining over 17% in the past week. BNB is currently trading at a market cap of $47.8 million, compared to SOL\u2019s market cap of $43.7 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nSOL gained over 71% in the past month, outperforming many large-cap cryptocurrencies such as ETH, which has only gained 12.4%.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Reason Behind Solana\u2019s Recent Rally?\n\nSolana's recent price surge can be attributed to several factors, including:\n\nIncreased User Activity\n\nActive addresses on Solana have increased by nearly 400% in the last three months, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s in mid-November. This suggests an exceptional increase in retail activity, with crypto users likely migrating to Solana for its lower transaction costs, increased speculative activity, airdrop farming and more.\n\nAirdrops and Memecoins Caused Surge in DEX Volume\n\nRecent airdrops on Solana, particularly the Jito (JTO) airdrop worth five figures, have resulted in more users flocking to other Solana-based protocols in hopes of securing a future airdrop. Furthermore, memecoins trading craze, led by the Bonk memecoin, have boosted speculative user activity, causing the DEX volume on Solana to surpass Ethereum\u2019s for a week. Other memecoins on Solana, like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Silly Dragon (SILLY), also saw millions in daily volume on-chain, contributing to the rise in DEX volumes.\n\nInstitutional Capital Flows Into Solana\n\nSource: CoinShares\n\nSolana-based investment funds attracted $156 million in institutional inflows as of December 16, making it the crypto asset with the highest inflows behind only Bitcoin, suggesting robust institutional interest in Solana."

        "content": "In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, ongoing discussions center around optimal investment choices among Bitcoin, Ethereum, and alternative coins. Notably, crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, sharing insights on the X platform, explores the nuances of this market, highlighting the growing potential of altcoins amid the surging popularity of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nSo, let\u2019s unravel the insights into altcoin investments, the contrasting trajectories of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the strategic considerations for navigating the crypto space.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAltcoins On The Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nThe popular cryptocurrency analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe\u2019s analysis sheds light on the cyclical nature of crypto markets, emphasizing the recent resurgence in hype and sentiment. Notable performers like Solana and Injective have demonstrated remarkable surges, raising the question of whether altcoins remain a viable investment.\n\nMeanwhile, Van de Poppe acknowledges the market\u2019s ebb and flow, where specific segments outshine others due to ongoing rotations. Highlighting the success of the Solana ecosystem and its memecoin rallying by over 50x, the analyst cautions against blindly following coins hyped on social media.\n\nIn addition, he advises investors to scrutinize potential returns and risks, emphasizing the diminishing upside and increased volatility of projects that have already experienced substantial gains. The key takeaway is the importance of critical thinking and a discerning approach in a market often fueled by hype.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin, Ethereum Drop While ORDI Shines In Crypto Market\n\nBitcoin Vs. Ethereum: Analyst Decodes Investment Potential\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s analysis extends to the perennial debate between Bitcoin and Ethereum, exploring the recent success of Bitcoin price with an 80% return in eight weeks. However, as the momentum slows during the holiday week, questions arise about whether Bitcoin can sustain further upward trends.\n\nNotably, he also mentioned that the upcoming and much-anticipated Bitcoin Spot ETF might help BTC to keep the upward momentum in the coming days. In addition, the analyst suggests a potential shift towards Ethereum, which, despite recent challenges, is poised for growth with a Bitcoin Spot ETF expected in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, the contrasting trajectories of Bitcoin and Ethereum highlight the nuanced decision-making required in the crypto space. While Bitcoin may see a surge towards $50,000, Ethereum\u2019s potential rally to $3,000-3,500 appears a more reasonable approach, considering its correction against the BTC pair, he suggested.\n\nIn essence, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe\u2019s insights underscore the importance of diversification, critical evaluation, and a forward-thinking mindset in navigating the ever-dynamic crypto market. As the industry evolves, strategic decisions that go beyond fleeting hype become paramount for sustainable and profitable investments.\n\nAlso Read: Bitwise Holds Edge Over BlackRock With 20x Seed Fund"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the last bull market in 2021, the year 2023 has emerged as a pivotal time for the cryptocurrency industry. Amidst a flurry of new digital assets making their mark, Pullix (PLX) distinguishes itself with a hybrid approach to trading. This token has recently advanced into the fourth stage of its presale, targeting the wider crypto community amid another presale stage.\n\nThis post will discuss the rising interest in Pullix and the technology behind it. Let\u2019s begin.\n\nPullix Combines Two Trading Worlds\n\nThe crypto scene has seen the emergence of Pullix (PLX), a hybrid trading platform. It stands at the intersection of centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges. Its approach to trading makes it poised for adoption and potential growth in the future.\n\nWhat problems will it be solving, though? It is no secret that one of the biggest issues in the DeFi world is liquidity. It will address this through its hybrid DeFi model. Further, by partnering with institutional liquidity providers\u2014tier 1 banks\u2014as well as incentivizing users to provide liquidity through staking and yield farming, it will address the challenge.\n\nAdditionally, other problems it aims to solve include high costs, limited assets, regulatory ambiguities, and low confidence (FTX crash and recent Binance settlement). To address these challenges, it will offer global assets (crypto, stocks, etc.), cheaper fees, and transparency.\n\nIn the fourth stage of the presale, a token is priced at $0.07 prior to entering the market where it will becomeavailable for a wider audience.\n\nBonk (BONK): What's Next?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are a meme enthusiast or not; you would have likely heard of Bonk (BONK). It is arguably the best-performing cryptocurrency this year, soaring by over 13,000% year-to-date.\n\nWhile Bonk crypto has seen massive upside this year, analysts have been speculating about an imminent price correction. Crypto GVR, an analyst on X (formerly Twitter), is among those who have been calling a potential price correction for Bonk. As for now his Bonk crypto prediction is working out.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Bonk price is $0.00001533. With potential volatility surges in the coming days.\n\nEthereum (ETH): $9,000 by 2024?\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been largely inactive in the final quarter of 2023. It has been consolidating around the $2,200 and $2,300 levels. However, of late, it appears to be gaining traction.\n\nCurrently, the Ethereum price is around $2,300. Given the critical role it plays in the DeFi sector, it has been tipped to soar during the anticipated bull market in 2024. If you don\u2019t have some ETH in your portfolio, now might be a good time to do so.\n\nAccording to Crypto GVR\u2019s Ethereum price prediction, it will reach $9,000 in 2024.

        "content": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin talked about the blockchain\u2019s future in his recent blog.\n\nUsage of network remained high, however, its price saw a correction.\n\nEven though multiple altcoins have followed suit after Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] rally, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] price has not seen much growth in the recent past.\n\nDespite this developments have ensued on the network with founder Vitalik committed to the vision of Ethereum.\n\nHas Ethereum lost its Cypherpunk?\n\nIn a recent blog post titled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,\u201d Vitalik Buterin outlined a promising future for the network, driven by significant developments across various fronts.\n\nHe stated that scalability solutions, such as rollups, are addressing Ethereum\u2019s historical scalability challenges, allowing for more efficient transaction processing. Second-generation privacy solutions, including projects like Railway and Nocturne, are enhancing user confidentiality.\n\nHe also mentioned the concept of account abstraction is gaining traction, enabling users to interact with smart contracts without the need for native cryptocurrency holdings, making Ethereum more accessible.\n\nProgress in the development of light clients is reducing resource requirements and increasing network accessibility. Zero knowledge proofs, once considered a distant technology, are becoming more developer-friendly, offering enhanced privacy and verification capabilities.\n\nThe blog post also emphasizes a return to core values within the crypto community, including open global participation, decentralization, and a cooperative mindset.\n\nThese updates collectively aim to address scalability concerns, reduce transaction fees, and bolster privacy and security.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum may experience improved efficiency, making it more appealing to a wider user base and enabling a broader array of applications.\n\nHowever, the success of these changes depends on community adoption and effective implementation.\n\nHow is Ethereum doing?\n\nComing to the state of the protocol, it was seen that the gas usage on the network has remained consistent. This meant activity on the network was high.\n\nHowever, the number of NFT trades occurring on the Ethereum network has fallen.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThis could have a negative impact on Ethereum in the future as NFT trades make up a large amount of the overall activity on the network.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $2,361.39 and its price had fallen by -1.21% in the last 24 hours.

        "title": "Crypto in 2024: New Blockchain Projects to Watch This Year - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Crypto in 2024 is set for a sensational year. By all appearances, the cryptocurrency bears have gone back into hibernation. With the Bitcoin halving rapidly approaching and spot Bitcoin ETFs on Wall St\u2019s doorstep, the Bulls anticipate a glorious charge throughout the year ahead.\n\nOlder blockchains and coins in the crypto market are well understood by this time. We all know what BTC and Ethereum (ETH) are capable of and what we can expect from their roadmaps in 2024.\n\nWhat about the newer, somewhat undiscovered digital currencies in the digital currency ecosystem? Which new protocols will find creative new ways of reimagining decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and everything blockchain technology offers?\n\nCrypto in 2024: What to Expect\n\nWhile 2023 saw Ethereum Layer 2s, zero-knowledge proofing, and Bitcoin Ordinals dominating the headlines, what big narratives can we expect to see in 2024?\n\nSolana\u2019s (SOL) meteoric growth towards the end of 2023, alongside the expansion of the Cosmos (ATOM) ecosystem through chains like Injective Protocol (INJ), suggests that the era of Ethereum-based dominance might be coming to an end.\n\nOf course, despite the success of non-EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains, Ethereum-based smart contracts and dApps still rule the roost and attract the highest developer activity and TVL statistics. While non-EVM chains will thrive, platforms that find a way to leverage Ethereum-based architecture are automatically well-placed for user adoption.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s gravity cannot be ignored. With the next Bitcoin halving mere months away and a Spot BTC ETF expected to be approved early next year, things are looking good for the digital asset king. Bitcoin-Fi is coming, and Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens might have just been the beginning.\n\n5 New Blockchain Projects and Protocols You Need to Know About\n\nQuick disclaimer: the crypto market is largely driven by speculation and hype. As a result, shiny, new protocols tend to perform better than established platforms we\u2019re already familiar with.\n\nAt the same time, this excitement and speculation makes these new crypto assets far more volatile and high-risk. They may not be well-suited to low-risk investment strategies.\n\nLet\u2019s explore some of the most captivating and new blockchain projects we can expect to see more of in 2024.\n\n1. Monad\n\nMonad is an emerging Layer 1 blockchain that promises to do what every other Layer 1 blockchain promises. Like many before, the Proof-of-Stake network claims greater scalability, security, and decentralization than its Web3 rivals. Nothing we haven\u2019t heard before, right?\n\nWhere Monad separates itself from its peers is in its network architecture. Like Aptos (APT), Monad leverages pipelining and a Parallel Execution Engine to reach a transaction throughput of up to 10,000 TPS (transactions per second). On top of that, Monad boasts a 1-second blocktime and single slot finality, ensuring the blockchain can handle huge amounts of traffic.\n\nThe final jewel in the crown, Monad is also fully EVM-compatible, making it easy for developers and users to port across and interact with the Monad network as easily as they would on any Ethereum-based network.\n\nThe Monad blockchain has yet to launch; however, the network\u2019s Testnet is expected to go live in Q1 2024. With backing from Dragonfly Capital and other influential firms, Monad is not to be missed in 2024.\n\n2. Celestia\n\nA recent addition to the thriving Cosmos ecosystem, Celestia tackles blockchain architecture from a new angle. While monolithic blockchains like Ethereum have frequently suffered from scalability issues, modular networks like Celestia work by decoupling blockchain consensus and transaction execution.\n\nIn simple terms, modular networks split blockchain functions to promote smooth and diversified operations. Using Celestia, developers can easily launch their own blockchain using a variety of existing virtual machines, including EVM or Cosmos-based platforms.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, becoming a network contributor is easier than ever. Many blockchain enthusiasts successfully operate Celestia light nodes from their mobile phones, helping to decentralize and secure the network from their pockets.\n\nThe Celestia blockchain, along with its native token, TIA, was launched in the final quarter of 2023. While it\u2019s technically not a \u2018new\u2019 chain launching in 2024, this emerging network is still largely unknown by many crypto enthusiasts, earning it a place in this list.\n\n3. LayerZero\n\nInteroperability has been one of the biggest hassles facing cryptocurrency for years. Bridging digital assets across chains can sometimes be a complicated nightmare, plagued with high fees, slippage costs, and plenty of exploits and hacks.\n\nLayerzero aims to solve this monumental task by providing the necessary infrastructure that will allow different blockchains to communicate effectively. We\u2019re already seeing the high demand for LayerZero services and products, with cross-chain bridges like Stargate making it easier than ever to move stablecoins and other sources of liquidity across 50+ networks in a few quicks.\n\nHaving already transferred over $50B worth of crypto assets across dozens of chains, LayerZero is just getting started. With a generous airdrop expected to occur sometime in 2024, it\u2019s worth adding LayerZero to your list of coins to watch in crypto in 2024.\n\n4. Inscriptions\n\nOrdinals and BRC-20 tokens have taken the crypto market by storm in 2023, bringing exciting new use cases to Bitcoin and completely reinventing the fundamentals of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency. Certain BRC-20 protocols and providers, like TRAC and PIPE, promise to bring Bitcoin into the future by building native DeFi applications on the Bitcoin network.\n\nBut the excitement hasn\u2019t been limited to Bitcoin alone. Inscription tokens have been cropping up on almost every blockchain in the industry, driving transaction fees haywire across the space. Whether SOLS on Solana, DOGI on Dogecoin, or POLS on Polygon, inscription tokens draw plenty of ire from all sides.\n\nOne could argue that while BRC-20 tokens might have a unique role in Bitcoin, they\u2019re largely redundant on blockchains that are already programmable. We still haven\u2019t heard the end of Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens.\n\n5. NEON\n\nLast but not least, NEON joins our list of exciting new blockchain protocols to watch in 2024. NEON EVM is a unique network that aims to give us the best of both worlds and dispel Layer 1 maximalism forever.\n\nNEON EVM is an Ethereum-compatible blockchain built on Solana. This means that users and developers can enjoy the benefits of Ethereum-based smart contracts while settling transactions using Solana\u2019s industry-leading speeds and minimal gas fees.\n\nLike TIA, the NEON blockchain and native token went live towards the end of 2023. Following the price of Bitcoin, both assets witnessed a surging market cap and posted new all-time highs in December 2023.\n\nAs a part of the wider ecosystem, NEON is widely expected to follow Solana\u2019s price movements. However, given its smaller market cap and lower liquidity and trading volume, the asset will suffer much higher volatility.\n\nNEON takes the best fundamentals of Ethereum and Solana and mixes them into one complete package. If you are a fan of Solana, Ethereum, or even both, NEON is a crypto worth researching in 2024.\n\nCrypto in 2024 Pros and Cons\n\nNaturally, there is still plenty that could go wrong in crypto in 2024. After the Terra Luna collapse devastation and the FTX insolvency, 2023 seemed to be the ultimate rally year. Before getting too euphoric heading into 2024, let\u2019s look at the pros and cons that could await us.\n\nPros\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF \u2013 A Spot Bitcoin ETF approval would allow some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions, like BlackRock, to start offering BTC funds to their clients. This could potentially bring an influx of billions into the crypto market.\n\n\u2013 A Spot Bitcoin ETF approval would allow some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions, like BlackRock, to start offering BTC funds to their clients.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has made his anti-bitcoin thoughts very clear, recommending that the Government should shut it down.\n\n\u2013 Just because BlackRock and Valkyrie are on board doesn\u2019t mean every Wall St brokerage wants to see crypto succeed. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has made his anti-bitcoin thoughts very clear, recommending that the Government should shut it down. Misuse of Technology \u2013 While Blockchain has many benefits, some would argue that its functions can be misused. For example, Central Bank Digital Currencies can give governments far greater control of your money than is currently possible.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that a Bitcoin halving doesn\u2019t automatically guarantee a new crypto bull run. There are no certainties in the crypto market, so evaluate your risk tolerance before investing.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nStaying informed on fascinating new projects in the crypto space is a good way to keep ahead of the curve and learn about emerging protocols before they become popular.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "Investors at large were accumulating ETH while its price remained low.\n\nThough confidence was high, market indicators remained bearish on ETH.\n\nAs we bid adieu to 2023, Ethereum [ETH], the king of altcoins, made remarkable moves in a bid to outshine the king of cryptos, Bitcoin [BTC].\n\nA recent development signified increased confidence among investors in ETH at a time when Bitcoin awaits a major event. Does this mean that Ethereum will earn investors profits in 2024?\n\nLong-term holders are confident in Ethereum\n\nAs per the latest tweet from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum recently flipped Bitcoin in a key metric. To be precise, Ethereum\u2019s total number of long-term holders [LTHs] surpassed that of Bitcoin for the second time ever.\n\nThis reflected investors\u2019 faith in ETH, showing that they expected the altcoin to surge in the coming year.\n\n2023 Review! This year, the percent of long-term $ETH holders surpassed that of Bitcoin for the second time ever! pic.twitter.com/i6kDzAjzgM \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 30, 2023\n\nIt was interesting to note that while ETH overtook Bitcoin in terms of LTHs, the average holding time of Bitcoin was around four years, while Cardano\u2019s [ADA] was less than a year, as reported earlier by AMBCrypto.\n\nTo see whether long-term holders\u2019 mindsets affected retail investors\u2019 behavior, AMBCrypto checked Santiment\u2019s data.\n\nOur analysis found that the market at large was showing faith in ETH as it continued to stockpile. ETH\u2019s Supply on Exchanges witnessed a drop in the recent past, while its Supply outside of Exchanges rose consistently.\n\nThe fact that investors were buying ETH was further proven by AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data, as ETH\u2019s exchange reserve was decreasing at press time.\n\nWhale activity around Ethereum also remained high throughout the last month, as evident from the rise in its whale transaction count. In fact, whales were shown to be buying Ethereum, as the altcoin\u2019s supply held by top addresses shot up.\n\nThings on the derivatives side also looked optimistic, as its Taker Buy Sell Ratio was green. This meant that buying sentiment was dominant in the Futures market.\n\nThe coin\u2019s Funding Rate also remained high, meaning that the derivatives investors were actively buying ETH at press time.\n\n2024 to be bullish for Ethereum?\n\nHowever, despite investors\u2019 attempts to stockpile ETH, the token\u2019s price action turned bearish during the concluding days of 2023. According to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by nearly 1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,283.21 with a market capitalization of over $274 billion.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nTo see whether Ethereum would begin 2024 with a bull rally, AMBCrypto took a look at its daily chart. Our analysis found that investor confidence in ETH might take time to reflect on its price, as the MACD displayed a bearish crossover at press time.\n\nIts Relative Strength Index (RSI) also moved downward, suggesting a slight price drop in the near term."

        "content": "In a popular blog post titled \u2018Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,\u2019 Ethereum Founder, Vitalik Buterin, says the vision of a decentralized internet is being eclipsed by the challenging reality of rising transaction fees on blockchain networks.\n\nAccording to Buterin, the initial vision of cryptocurrency assets as a democratizing force in finance appears to be waning, with practical, everyday use cases becoming more theoretical than realized in practice. Buterin points out that discussions about \u2018consumer crypto payments\u2019 have noticeably dwindled.\n\nThese escalating fees are erecting a barrier to entry, impeding innovation, and hindering the widespread adoption of cryptocurrency as a medium for transactions and saving.\n\nThey have marginalized nearly all users except the most speculative and risk-tolerant individuals, colloquially referred to as \u2018degen gamblers.\u2019 These individuals are characterized as the only audience still willing to bear the high fees for transaction.\n\n\u201cBut when transaction fees go to over $100, as they have during the peak of the bull markets, there is exactly one audience that remains willing to play \u2013 and in fact, because coin prices are going up and they\u2019re getting richer, becomes even more willing to play: degen gamblers,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\n\u201cDegen gamblers can be okay in moderate doses, and I have talked to plenty of people at events who were motivated to join crypto for the money but stayed for the ideals. But when they are the largest group using the chain on a large scale, this adjusts the public perception and the crypto space\u2019s internal culture, and leads to many of the other negatives that we have seen play out over the last few years.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Buterin advocates for introspection and proactive measures within the community. He emphasizes the necessity for scalable solutions that reduce barriers and revive the initial inclusive vision of Web3. This challenge extends beyond technical considerations, encompassing cultural shifts that demand a return to the foundational principles that initially made the concept of decentralized digital currency appealing to a wide audience. As for Ethereum, which has been accused of ceding its decentralization to centralized staking pools, Buterin noted various positives in 2023, including rollups, account abstraction, and Zero Knowledge Proofs which have become more common. These are some of the technologies that can help \u2018take things in a different direction going forward.\u2019 Follow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates Join and interact with our Telegram community _________________________________________ _________________________________________"

The approval of such products would enable more institutional participation in the digital asset space.\n\nMcDermott noted that while spot crypto ETFs may have a gradual impact rather than an immediate spike, he expects to see \u201ca broadening and a deepening of liquidity and those looking to trade the product\u201d in 2023.\n\nThe Growth Potential in Digital Assets\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, McDermott believes the blockchain industry will continue expanding due to increasing real-world adoption and supportive regulations. Over the past year, clearer policies and frameworks have already driven more institutional involvement in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, Goldman Sachs announced the launch of its tokenization platform, GS DAP, to streamline the issuance, management, and trading of tokenized assets across various asset classes.\n\nIn 2020, Matthew McDermott joined Goldman as head of digital assets. Known for his visionary approach to financial markets, he believes blockchain technology is key to revitalizing and empowering the financial system."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Pumps Above $2,300 While Meme Kombat Blasts Past $5m as Meme Coin Whales Buy Big\n\nFriday, December 28th, 2023 \u2013 Altcoins like Ethereum are hotting up and Meme Kombat is joining the party too, after raising more than $5 million to pass the 50% milestone in its ICO. As the new meme coin enters the latter half of its presale its fundraising run rate is accelerating as whales pile in.\n\nMeme coins remain one of the most popular segments in crypto, providing traders with the chance to snare gains that can often be measured in the thousands of percent. Meme Kombat is well-positioned to be among the big hitters when it launches. The token has a $10m hard cap target.\n\nAmong the meme coin heavyweights that Meme Kombat aspires to emulate are the likes of Pepe and Shiba with their multi-billion dollar market capitalizations.\n\nBut in the meme coin space, even more so than elsewhere in crypto, new coins are being launched every day in a hyper-competitive market. Pawswap (+225%) and Baby Grok (+75%) and Spurdo (+85%) are just three of the coins that have been setting the pace for meme coins over the past seven days, for example.\n\nAcross crypto as a whole, buyers are back in the driving seat as the expected approval of a spot bitcoin ETF fuels a new bull run for the industry. Bitcoin is the best-performing financial asset of 2023 and altcoins are beginning to catch up.\n\nMeanwhile, the ETH price was nearly 10% higher yesterday, blasting past $2,400. Earlier in the week it was the turn of Ethereum competitor Solana to lead the pack, at one stage chalking up a daily gain of 20%.\n\nHelping to propel Solana higher was the remarkable rise of BONK, a meme coin that runs on its blockchain. It is no surprise then, as meme coin fever continues, that Ethereum-powered Meme Kombat has raised $5 million in double-quick time.\n\nWe hit $5 million raised in the $MK presale\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude80 Congrats fighters! pic.twitter.com/SK5TGEuson \u2014 Meme Kombat (@Meme_Kombat) December 28, 2023\n\nWhale buys $83,845 worth of Meme Kombat ($MK)\n\n\n\nAgainst this favorable backdrop for cryptocurrencies, and meme coins in particular, Meme Kombat has a lot going for it because of its gaming attributes and passive income potential from staking.\n\nIn the past few hours alone, whales have been stepping up to the plate to buy at scale. One wallet address bought $83,000 worth of $MK:\n\n4 hours until the price of $MK goes up to $0.268\u23f0 In the meantime, take a look at these MAJOR buys that came in over the last day\ud83e\udd29 One was a whopping $84k and the other $20k\ud83c\udf89 pic.twitter.com/tsGsvuPujG \u2014 Meme Kombat (@Meme_Kombat) December 28, 2023\n\nMeme Kombat brings together all the top meme coins in a battling arena where players bet on the outcome of the bouts. Its unique design means it has appeal across the meme coin space, regardless of which of the coins a user might actually hold.\n\nAltcoin season is hotting up and meme coins like Meme Kombat continue to be all the rage. $MK token is just about to enter Stage 9 in which it will be priced at $0.268. In a week\u2019s time, on January 4 the price rises to $0.272. It means there will only be a week to go to grab the lowest price available \u2013 and then it is the final price in presale until the hard cap is reached.\n\nThere is a strong chance that the current price stage will sell out before the one-week window closes, so there\u2019s no time to lose to conduct due diligence before deciding to buy.\n\nPEPE is up 4,888% since April, but GameFi coin Meme Kombat ($MK) can do even better\n\n\n\nSince April 2023 when it was trading at its all-time low (it launched that month), $PEPE has risen in price by 4,888%. According to Coinmarketcap data $PEPE has a market cap of $577 million. DEXTools shows token holders at 154k on decentralized exchanges in a testament to the popularity of the frog coin.\n\nMeme Kombat shows every sign of having the same potential as $PEPE, although it resides on the Ethereum blockchain. Because it will host battles featuring all the top meme coins, it will appeal to market participants across the meme coin space, whichever coin they might be invested in.\n\nMeme coins continue to act as a magnet for traders seeking to pocket large alpha returns, but the space has matured beyond just chasing short-term price movements.\n\nIncreasingly, traders are hunting for coins that have a use case that could scale and deliver profits. Meme Kombat is just such a coin.\n\nThe project is building an Arena in which meme characters battle and players bet on the outcomes. As such, Meme Kombat encompasses the revenue-generating potential of two of the fastest-growing sectors in crypto outside of meme coins \u2013 gaming and betting.\n\nAccording to crypto data site CoinGecko, GameFi has a market cap of $20.6 billion while gambling tokens are valued at $796 million and growing. CoinGecko values the meme coins sector at an impressive $23.7 billion. Meme Kombat is perfectly positioned to pitch into this expanding total addressable market of $45 billion.\n\nWhat is so exciting about the Meme Kombat market fit is the way in which its battling meme characters and betting business model is able to appeal to the existing communities coalescing around the most high-profile meme coins.\n\nAll of those communities will have an interest in how their favored meme coin fares in the Meme Kombat Arena. Many will want to partake of the fun and profits to be had from involvement in the ecosystem.\n\nMeme Kombat\u2019s Season 1 will be available after the presale is sold out and the project launched. There are 11 meme characters you can battle with in Season 1: Milady, Baby Doge, Doge, Floki, Kishu, Mong, Pepe, Pepe2, Shiba, Sponge and Wojak.\n\nSeason 2 meme characters will be out just before Season 1 wraps up.\n\nMeme Kombat presale buyers can stake to earn 184% APY\n\n\n\nAnd there is no need to wait for the platform to go live before putting your money to work with Meme Kombat ($MK). If you invest in the ICO today, you can immediately stake your token to earn an annual percentage yield that is currently sitting at 184%.\n\nWhen the battling and betting system is turned on, stakers will be able to bet while earning APY at the same time. Three-quarters of sold $MK is now staked, providing buyers will the comfort of knowing that sell pressure will be dampened over the short term. Stakers must hold their tokens for a minimum of seven days after the launch of the coin.\n\n$MK dynamic staking combines on-chain and off-chain transactions, so users only pay network fees when they stake and unstake their $MK while claiming rewards takes place off-chain, incurring no fees.\n\nAll staking interactions are logged in real-time, plus the staking system will be integrated with the game, allowing platform users to easily choose between staking tokens or using them for battles..\n\nThe number of stakers is powering ahead as interest in the coin explodes. At present, 21.3 million $MK has been staked, up from 13.8 million on December 14. Total rewards of 4,104,400 $MK have accrued to the 6,189 stakers.\n\nWorth bearing in mind for buyers is the fact that 76% of sold coins have been staked, which means there will be much less selling pressure when it launches on exchanges than is typically the case for newly listed tokens.\n\nExperts predict Meme Kombat ($MK) price to 10x at launch\n\n\n\nYouTube crypto analysts have spotted the ripening opportunity that is Meme Kombat. ClayBro, who has 116k subscribers to his channel describes Meme Kombat as what could be the \u201cbiggest meme coin gaming token of 2024\u201d.\n\nMatthew Perry tells his 200k-plus subscribers that it could be the 10x coin they have been looking for.\n\nJacob Crypto Bury is of like mind, predicting possible 10x returns for early investors in the project meme coin gaming project.\n\nMeme Kombat total token supply is 120,000,000, of which thirty percent is allocated for staking and battle rewards, 10% for community rewards, and 10% for decentralized exchange liquidity. Fifty percent of the total token supply is on sale in the ICO.\n\nProspective investors can rest assured because the Meme Kombat smart contract is fully security audited and no major issues have been detected, so you can buy with confidence.\n\nIn the final analysis, meme coins live and die by the strength of the communities that they can build. Success can depend on subjective elements such as the humor and the artwork a project creates.\n\nBut Meme Kombat has the advantage of riding on the coattails of the popularity of the coins that will feature in its games, so it has plenty of strings to its bow.\n\nStill, on artwork and humor alone, Meme Kombat knocks it out of the park. Ultimately, its strong utility value as a battling arena that blends gambling and gaming is the clincher.\n\nDon\u2019t let Meme Kombat slip through your fingers \u2013 it could be the crypto gem of 2024."

        "title": "Multiple Analysts Bullish on Ethereum \u2013 Meme Moguls to Rally by 100x Following Its Launch - Crypto Reporter",
        "content": "A major crypto analyst with over 700,000 followers recently made a bullish outlook surrounding the future of Ethereum (ETH), which can result in a major price upswing during the upcoming months.\n\nFueled by the Ethereum ETFs that are set to come next year, if approved, this could boost the crypto to astronomical levels. Despite this, Meme Moguls (MGLS) has also captured a significant level of attention with the performance of its presale. Today, we will look at both of these projects to see just which is the best crypto to invest in.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) to Experience Major Rally Following Its Launch\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) will launch an innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) platform that will change how users access gaming experiences, as it is mixed with real-world economics.\n\nUsers can dive into different games and competitions to climb the leaderboards and earn more. The project is undergoing its blockchain ICO and has already attracted significant attention.\n\nMoguls World is the dedicated Metaverse available in the ecosystem. In it, players can mine tokens and even join liquidity pools.\n\nEach player can begin with $100,000 in virtual currency and create a portfolio to complete the challenges and turn their profits into real cashable returns. Community members can also set up tournaments on top of the platform and can become eligible for rewards based on their share of the pool and the annual percentage returns.\n\nMGLS is the native crypto behind the project, and it\u2019s used as the in-game currency and governance tokens that add tangible value to the ecosystem. The project will let users compete in virtual stock market trading games.\n\nDuring Stage 3, MGLS is offered at $0.0025, and fueled by the vast utility of the ecosystem, analysts project an upswing of 100x upon its launch and listing on major Tier-1 exchanges.\n\nEthereum (ETH) to Reach Over $4,000 in 2024 Following ETF Approval\n\nEthereum (ETH) is rising, and it\u2019s pushed by a catalyst that typically takes a backseat to the market narrative set by Bitcoin. A popular pseudonymous analyst, Pentoshi, shared insights on X (Twitter), highlighting the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs in the upcoming 12 months. According to the analyst, This could surge the ETH crypto\u2019s value by over 50%.\n\nDuring the past week, ETH moved up in value from $2,143 to $2,335. This marked a total weekly increase of 7.4% and an annual increase of 87.8%. According to the Ethereum price prediction, it can climb as far as $4,031.01 in 2024.\n\nPentoshi\u2019s optimism resonates with different analysts as well, including Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, who foresees a promising 12 months for the ETH crypto.\n\nSummary\n\nWhile Ethereum is bullish, another crypto is picking up significant attention. The blockchain ICO of Meme Moguls has been a major point of appeal.\n\nWith its unique blend of meme-inspired assets, P2E gaming, and real-world economics, it can help traders improve their strategies and monetize their time in the process. All of these aspects make it the best crypto to invest in today.\n\nLearn more about the $MGLS here:\n\nVisit Meme Moguls | Join the Community\n\nDisclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the content provider and do not necessarily represent those of Crypto Reporter.

        "title": "Is This the New 100x Gem? Pushd (PUSHD) Launches Presale To Disrupt the e-Commerce Market. Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) Drop - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Volatility is a common trend in the cryptocurrency market and can be a bitter-sweet pill. Two top altcoins that have been on the bitter end of this pill are Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA). After a brief rally, both cryptocurrencies are facing serious price declines.\n\nOne altcoin that has broken out of this trend is Pushd (PUSHD). Launching the first decentralized blockchain eCommerce marketplace, this presale project has gained a lot of traction. But can it be the next crypto gen with 100x potential? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Faces Rejection At $2,500 Resistance\n\nAlthough Ethereum (ETH) has benefited from the bull market in 2023, it has failed to surmount the critical resistance at $2,500. However, in recent weeks, investor confidence in the leading altcoin has been on the rise.\n\nIn the recent price surge, the price of Ethereum climbed as high as $2,450 but couldn\u2019t close above this resistance. As a result of the rejection, the Ethereum price has dropped back to the $2,340 level. Data from CoinGlass hints at the reason for this decline.\n\nEarly in December, the Open Interest of ETH peaked at above $8.5 billion. However, it has dropped by more than 8%, showing that investors are closing their positions and cashing out of the recent Ethereum rally.\n\nCardano (ADA) Retraces After Massive Surge\n\nThe first quarters of the year were slow for Cardano (ADA), but now it\u2019s really going fast in fourth. Since October, the price of ADA has gone up a lot more than 150%. This is making Cardano coins trade as high as $0.70 in value now.\n\nBut, like ETH (Ethereum), Cardano\u2019s price didn\u2019t stay above this mark. Instead, it fell back to $0.6100 again. This pullback has worried many investors and market experts too.\n\nIf the price of Cardano does not go up at a certain level, it might drop even more. Some market experts have set a limit at $0.5 if ADA drops below its present support level. Even though things are not doing well, Pushd has been gaining strength?\n\nPushd (PUSHD) Disrupts eCommerce: Can It Be the New 100x Gem?\n\nPushd (PUSDH) is one of the few altcoins with a head of steam behind the project. There have been so much talks about this project because of its new marketplace that seeks to revolutionize the eCommerce industry. eCommerce has been projected to hit a valuation of $6 trillion by 2024.\n\nThe entry of Pushd into this mammoth market is the reason for the growing excitement. So, what is Pushd looking to do in eCommerce? Pushd is building the world\u2019s first web3 marketplace with the aim of connecting buyers and sellers.\n\nWhile there are several other marketplaces, Pushd stands out because of its integration of blockchain. Using the latest tech in the industry, Pushd looks to solve some major problems that have restricted the industry.\n\nThe platform has eliminated listing fees, thus reducing the total cost for both sellers and buyers. Sellers also enjoy instant payments rather than waiting days to get their funds. Buyers are not left out as well, as the platform rewards them for their engagement.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile Ethereum and Cardano face short-term declines, Pushd continues to build momentum. With solutions to the key problems in eCommerce, it\u2019s easy to see why Pushd is being hyped as the next 100x gem in the crypto space.\n\nBefore this massive surge, you have a great opportunity to stack the PUSHD tokens, as they only trade at $0.01. Don\u2019t miss out on this great opportunity to join the next blue chip crypto project.\n\nFor more information about the ongoing Pushd (PUSHD) Presale, please visit their website.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Buterin\u2019s proposition is aimed at reducing Ethereum\u2019s design weakness and the co-founder did not commit to a timeline for changes presented in the roadmap.\n\nAlso read: PancakeSwap community votes to remove 300 million CAKE from supply\n\nEthereum maintains core priorities plans updates to design\n\nIn his recent tweet on X, Vitalik Buterin shared an updated roadmap for the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

ETH yielded nearly 12% gains for holders in the past week."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) were subject to some major whale transactions, Whale Alert disclosed. According to the whale tracking handle, 1,335 BTC was transferred from Coinbase to an unknown wallet on December 30.\n\nWhale Alert @whale_alert \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 1,335 #BTC (56,252,449 USD) transferred from #Coinbase to unknown wallethttps://t.co/0XEFmMZAaX\n\nBut that was not the only transaction involving Bitcoin. A few hours before the above transfer, another whale sent 3,144 BTC to Coinbase.\n\nThese two transactions implied that both whales involved were on opposite sides of the divide. While the first one plans to hold, the latter transfer suggests a sell-off. However, it was a different case for ETH.\n\nAround the same period, $33.50 million worth of ETH was transferred into the Coinbase exchange. There was another 9,991 ETH moved into the same exchange hours before the latest one.\n\nWhale Alert @whale_alert \ud83d\udea8 9,991 #ETH (23,043,351 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/dDSXRNMJOu\n\nAn ETH Dump Ahead?\n\nEarlier, Coin Edition reported about an ETH breakout which led the altcoin price above $2,400. The ETH/USD 4-hour chart displayed a bullish structure until December 27. However, the past two days have seen the altcoin confined between $2,292 and $2,379.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) also showed that the initial price uptrend had weakened. The decreasing reading of the RSI suggests a bearish momentum. If not curtailed, it could lead to a decline below 2,300.\n\nMeanwhile, the RSI had formed higher lows while ETH\u2019s price formed lower highs, indicating a bullish divergence. This disparity implied that a reversal to the upside could be near.\n\nCoin Edition\n\nIf this remains the case, then ETH\u2019s potential decline might be short-lived. Also, a move toward $2,500 could be next for the coin.\n\nBTC Nears $40,000\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price action over the last few days has been contrary to the optimism in the market about a potential ETF approval. At press time, the price had dropped below $42,000.\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, the MACD showed that the coin\u2019s momentum was bearish. This position made it clear that a drop toward $40,000 could be expected.\n\nOn the contrary, if there is an increase in accumulation, a bullish breakout toward $45,000 could be next.\n\nCoin Edition\n\nHowever, the Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) indicator revealed that accumulation has not significantly increased over the last few days. Should this indicator continue to hover around the same zone, then BTC\u2019s dip might be unavoidable.\n\nIn the short term, ETH and BTC would most likely experience slight price decreases. However, this does not invalidate a bullish thesis in the foreseeable future."

        "content": "In the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency, the investment landscape is ever-evolving, and pro investors are making strategic moves to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Recently, a noteworthy development has captured the eye of the cryptocurrency community: an Ethereum (ETH) investor boasting a huge $12 million portfolio has selected to dive into the presale of Pushd (PUSHD). This strategic move raises questions about the investor\u2019s foresight and the growth trajectory of Ethereum (ETH) and the innovative Pushd platform.\n\nAssessing the Course of Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH), presently trading at $2,335, has displayed fascinating price action by breaching a key resistance degree at $2,290, forming an inverse head and shoulder pattern.

Technical indicators, inclusive of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), further guide the bullish sentiment, hinting at room for extra upward motion.

This rare event, occurring only for the second time in history, signals a noteworthy shift in investor behavior. The \u201cHodler Ratio\u201d chart emerges as a crucial tool, indicating the trust and long-term commitment investors place in Ethereum.\n\nThe \u201cHodler Ratio\u201d is a metric that gauges investor commitment by measuring the percentage of long-term holders. Recent data from this chart reveals Ethereum\u2019s ascendancy over Bitcoin in the proportion of long-term holders. IntoTheBlock\u2019s tweet on December 30, 2023, solidifies this observation, marking a historic moment in the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nEthereum\u2019s achievement in surpassing Bitcoin in the percentage of long-term holders is a historic milestone. This shift not only underscores the growing confidence in Ethereum but also positions it as a long-term investment choice, as depicted by the Hodler Ratio.\n\nFactors Behind Ethereum\u2019s Success in Long-Term Hodlers\n\nEthereum\u2019s continuous development plays a pivotal role in shaping investor confidence. The ongoing enhancements to the network, coupled with a strategic roadmap, have instilled trust among investors. Additionally, the expanding ecosystem on Layer 2 networks has further contributed to Ethereum\u2019s success in attracting and retaining long-term holders.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ability to surpass Bitcoin in long-term holders can be attributed to a surge in investor confidence. Many investors believe that Ethereum is yet to fully unveil its true market potential, positioning it as a compelling investment choice. This prevailing sentiment has significantly influenced the Hodler Ratio in Ethereum\u2019s favor.\n\nWhile a high percentage of long-term holders signifies trust and a long-term vision, it brings potential challenges. Reduced liquidity and short-term price performance hurdles may arise. However, in the context of accumulation, this situation is viewed positively, suggesting potential future price growth due to a decrease in supply.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price Performance, Challenges, and Layer 2 Networks Boost\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s recent success in long-term holdings, its price performance lags behind some peers. Various factors, including market cycles and broader economic conditions, influence Ethereum\u2019s current scenario. It is crucial to acknowledge both the positive milestone and the existing challenges, maintaining a balanced perspective on Ethereum\u2019s position in the market.\n\nThe positive developments on Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 networks provide a silver lining. Increased activity and scaling solutions offered by these networks enhance Ethereum\u2019s usability.

        "content": "TLDR\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) is predicted to drop below $20 as it awaits a network upgrade.\n\nBNB rallies backed by ecosystem expansion as experts foresee a rally above $270.\n\nRebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) generates 100% during the ongoing presale with further gains anticipated.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) and BNB have been two of the best altcoins historically in terms of profitability. However, investors who have missed these tokens need not to worry. This is because the newly launched Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) presents them with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Let\u2019s understand the factors making $RBLZ the best crypto to invest in ahead of ETC and BNB.\n\nEthereum Classic Trades Sideways as it Gears Up For Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum Classic (ETC) token rose to a monthly high of $22.88 on December 9, along with the market rally. Since then, the Ethereum Classic (ETC) price has dipped slightly to trade sideways. The Ethereum Classic (ETC) token had dropped 8.5% to trade at $20.92 on December 24.\n\nAmid the sideways price action for the ETC token, Ethereum Classic made a major announcement. On December 12, Ethereum Classic announced that its Spiral Network Upgrade will be completed by January 31, 2024. The upgrade will bring protocol parity to Ethereum Classic with the Shanghai upgrade of Ethereum.\n\nAs the Ethereum Classic network waits for the upgrade, experts are bearish on the ETC price. They predict the ETC price to trade sideways and even drop in the coming weeks. Their expectation is for the ETC token to drop below $20.\n\nBNB Catches Up With The Market as Ecosystem Continues Expansion\n\nThe BNB token had been one of the underperformers in the recent market rally. However, in the past few weeks, the BNB token has finally shown signs of strength. From $239.55 on December 12, the BNB token has rallied 10.6% to reach $265.10 on December 24. This rally has been the result of massive growth for the BNB ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, the much-awaited BNB Greenfield Roadmap was introduced on December 12. Furthermore, on December 18, opBRC announced that it would be building itself on the BNB Chains opBNB network. SupraOracles also announced the integration of its services on BNB Chain on the same day.\n\nAs a result of these developments, experts predict the BNB token to rally in the coming weeks. They predict that the BNB token will rise above $270 shortly.\n\nRebel Satoshi Bamboozles Investors With Profitability and Real-World Utility\n\nRebel Satoshi is on a mission to bring about a revolution against the growing centralization in the market. The Rebel Satoshi project draws its inspiration from Satoshi Nakamoto and the ideals espoused by Guy Fawkes. The Rebel Satoshi rebellion will be a peaceful and joyous one brought about by its Recusant members.\n\nThe native governance and membership token of Rebel Satoshi is the ERC-20 standard, $RBLZ. The $RBLZ token is built on the Ethereum network, and its contract has been made public and audited by SourceHat. Rebel Satoshi aims to attain a $100 million market cap for $RBLZ and develop its ecosystem around it. The Rebel Satoshi ecosystem, once fully developed, will evolve into a play-to-earn game.\n\nRebel Satoshi has been conducting the presale for the $RBLZ token through multiple rounds. It began with the Early Bird Round at $0.010 per $RBLZ. The presale is currently in the Citizens Round 3 at $0.020 per $RBLZ with a 100% surge in the price. By the end of the presale, the total rally would be 150% to $0.025 per $RBLZ. This is when Rebel Satoshi will list the $RBLZ token across major exchanges.\n\nThus, by combining profitability and utility, $RBLZ has emerged as one of the best cryptos to buy, according to analysts.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nTop crypto analysts are seeing a bullish outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), growth that their on-chart performance and upward momentum will fuel.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Pentoshi is bullish on ETH, while crypto analyst TechDev highlighted that BTC\u2019s OBV is hinting at potentially new peaks.\n\nMany are now diversifying their holdings with Meme Moguls (MGLS). This upcoming platform will enable virtual trading and help anyone improve their trading strategies. We will go over each one to see why they are the best altcoins to buy.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Projected to Rise by TechDev \u2013 Price to Move Above $66,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) could soon see a major price rally, following its solid performance in the previous month. Crypto analyst TechDev highlighted that Bitcoin\u2019s on-balance volume (OBV) is currently hinting at potential new peaks through a post on X (Twitter). The analyst also noted how each time the OBV hints at a new high, the price of Bitcoin also achieves a new peak within one candle on the two-month chart.\n\nDuring the past week, BTC traded between $40,766.45 and $44,217.04. In the last 30 days, its up 14.2%, and according to the Bitcoin price prediction, it can surge to $66,583.71 in 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH) to Initiate Bull Run According to Pentoshi \u2013 Is $4,000 Possible?\n\nPentoshi, a pseudonymous analyst with over 700,000 followers on X (Twitter) noted that the possible approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs next year can give the crypto a solid boost.\n\nMultiple asset management firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Hashdex filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Pentoshi says that Ethereum will likely generate bullish momentum as a result of this.\n\nAs for the on-chart data, during the past week, Ethereum traded between $2,130.73 and $2,335.37. During the past year, the crypto is up 86%, and according to the Ethereum price prediction it can surge as far as $4,031.01 in 2024.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) Can Spike 100x Based Projections\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) has seen bullish momentum with its crypto ICO as it is introducing an entire Play-to-Earn (P2E) ecosystem that can disrupt the industry by introducing a new method in which players can learn how to invest while building wealth.\n\nAnyone can learn about investing and begin building their wealth with the innovative approach of virtual trading. In the Meme Moguls ecosystem, players are introduced to the world through getting $100,000 in virtual cash.\n\nAs a result, they can utilize it to create a portfolio. They can complete challenges and, by doing so, have the opportunity to turn the simulated profits into cashable returns.\n\nMembers of the community are also able to set up custom tournaments and even create prize pool buy-ins.\n\nThere is a game mode known as Beat The Market, for example, and each player outperforms the S&P 500 index to win. With the overall interest in meme-inspired assets growing and the vast ecosystem on offer, analysts expect the MGLS token to grow by 100x at launch. These aspects make it one of the best altcoins to buy.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum could both see a surge in value, but it will take some time for the cryptocurrencies to get there. In the meantime, Meme Moguls made massive waves with its crypto ICO. At Stage 3, the crypto is offered at a value of just $0.0025. As a result, this represents a solid entry point for those looking to diversify.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Are BRC-20 Tokens Worth the Hype? Uncover the Truth Behind the Future of Bitcoin - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Amassing over $600M in market cap and blowing Ethereum (ETH) NFT trading volume out of the water, BRC-20 Tokens and Ordinal inscriptions are here to stay. Initially considered an experimental flash in the pan, BRC-20 tokens have exploded onto the market, redefining how we use Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain may be the forefather of the entire crypto industry, but you cannot deny that it lacks utility. Compared to modern, smart contract-capable platforms like Ethereum and Solana (SOL), there\u2019s not much you can do with BTC other than HODL it or send it to another wallet.\n\nUntil now.\n\nWhat are BRC-20 Tokens? Are they reinventing BTC forever, or is the BRC-20 token standard polluting the Bitcoin network and leading the crypto world down a dark path?\n\nWhat are BRC-20 Tokens?\n\nAn extension of Casey Rodarmor\u2019s Ordinals protocol, the BRC-20 token standard creates fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. Created by Domo, a pseudonymous blockchain developer, BRC-20 is an experimental token standard that inscribes text or other fungible data onto individual Satoshis.\n\nBut why is this important, and why have the first BRC-20 tokens like ORDI, VMPX, and meme coins like PEPE (not that PEPE) exploded in value?\n\nSince it was originally launched in 2009, the Bitcoin network has provided a rather narrow range of utilities. BTC can be stored in a self-custodial wallet or sent to another Bitcoin wallet in exchange for value.\n\nNetwork upgrades like the Lightning Layer 2 Network might have helped Bitcoin become faster and more affordable, but the basic functions remain the same.\n\nBRC-20 tokens flip the script by adding greater complexity and utility to the Bitcoin network. In the same way that smart contracts govern innovative applications using the ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum and other EVM networks, BRC-20 tokens open a new world of possibilities on the Bitcoin blockchain, including decentralized finance.\n\nTapping into Bitcoin\u2019s unmatched market depth and liquidity, the BRC-20 token standard means that fungible satoshis can be traded directly on the Bitcoin network. As such, this novel phenomenon offers huge potential to expand the capabilities of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nHow Do BRC-20 Tokens Work?\n\nInstead of using smart contracts like Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 tokens, the BRC-20 protocol works by embedding custom JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) scripts onto individual satoshis, the smallest unit of BTC.\n\nThis allows BRC-20 tokens like SATS and TRAC to be traded natively over the Bitcoin blockchain or used as collateral and borrowed against in Bitcoin-based DeFi protocols. This on-chain functionality is perhaps one of the biggest advancements in the history of the Bitcoin network, providing previously unimaginable use cases for Bitcoin.\n\nAre BRC-20 Tokens the Same as Ordinals?\n\nAt this point, we need to make a clear distinction. While BRC-20 tokens use the foundational technology behind Bitcoin Ordinals, they\u2019re not quite the same thing. Technically speaking, BRC-20 tokens are Ordinals because they\u2019re created by inscribing data to individual Satoshis.\n\nDespite this, BRC-20s and Ordinals have one key difference: Fungibility.\n\nWhile each Bitcoin Ordinal is non-fungible and designed to be completely unique and distinguishable from each other, BRC-20s with the same name are interchangeable and bear the same value.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s look at one of the most popular Bitcoin Ordinal collections. As you can see, each and every one of these Bitcoin Frogs is different. Due to having different traits, some might be worth more than others.\n\nORDI tokens, on the other hand, are all the same. If I loan a friend 100 ORDI tokens, they don\u2019t need to pay me back the specific coins I gave them for the loan to be repaid. The 100 ORDI tokens I lent my friend are exactly identical to any other 100 ORDI tokens in the supply.\n\nHow to Trade BRC-20 Tokens\n\nAt this stage, dozens of permissionless marketplaces have cropped up all across the cryptocurrency space, allowing BRC-20 enthusiasts to trade to their heart\u2019s content.\n\nSome top-performing BRC-20 tokens with the highest trading volume and liquidity have even found their way onto top exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, and OKX.\n\nFor those who prefer an on-chain experience, you\u2019ll need a funded Bitcoin wallet supporting Taproot. Popular choices amongst the BRC-20 community include:\n\nUnisat Wallet\n\nXverse Wallet\n\nLeather Wallet\n\nOKX Wallet\n\nOnce you\u2019ve withdrawn some BTC to your Ordinal and BRC-20 compatible wallet, the easiest way to get involved is through BRC-20 trading sites like the Unisat Marketplace. From there, you can scan the range of tokens available and place orders on coins as you see fit.\n\nHow to Mint BRC-20 Tokens\n\nIf you have a higher risk for appetite, minting BRC-20 tokens is like partaking in an ICO. After a developer has registered a new BRC-20 token, you\u2019ll be able to inscribe the JSON scripts to Bitcoin satoshis yourself using platforms like Unisat.\n\nFor the purposes of this explanation, let\u2019s say I wanted to mint some YISU tokens. I\u2019d find YISU in the list of ongoing mints, review the token\u2019s information, and then click \u2018Mint Directly\u2019.\n\nAs you can see, this particular token only allows me to mint 2,100 inscriptions at a time. However, if I wanted to mint more than that, say 21,000, I\u2019d need to set the mint transaction to repeat 10 times.\n\nFrom there, input the BRC-20 compatible Bitcoin address where you\u2019d like to receive your tokens and set your preferred transaction fee based on network congestion.\n\nHit \u2018Submit & Pay Invoice\u2019 and confirm the transaction in your wallet. If you paid enough gas, your freshly inscribed BRC-20 tokens should appear in your wallet within 30 minutes.\n\nDisclaimer: YISU was randomly selected from the list of ongoing BRC-20 mints and is not endorsed by DailyCoin in any way, shape, or form.\n\nBRC-20 Token Concerns\n\nDespite being a huge step forward for blockchain technology in the Bitcoin ecosystem, these new digital assets have caused plenty of controversy within the Bitcoin community.\n\nThe Bitcoin Ordinal protocol, and by extension, BRC-20 tokens, demand enormous energy and resources. Inscribing immutable data onto individual satoshis is no easy feat, with the Proof-of-Work suffering debilitating network congestion that has sent Bitcoin transaction fees to all-time highs.\n\nBitcoin maximalists have been particularly scathing of the Ordinal and BRC-20 movement, arguing that these new tokens are polluting the network and detracting from Bitcoin\u2019s primary ethos.\n\nThe hype and excitement around BRC-20 tokens have also led to a massive influx of rug pulls, speculative pump-and-dumps, and scams.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn a recent interview with CNBC Television, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein gave a positive outlook on the future of Bitcoin, predicting a significant influx of capital into the market upon the anticipated approval of spot market Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nSonnenshein\u2019s optimism stems from the belief that this regulatory approval could open the floodgates for a massive investment opportunity, potentially attracting up to $30 trillion from previously untapped markets into crypto majors such as Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP, Cardano, Shiba Inu.\n\nUnlocking Opportunities for Investors\n\nSonnenshein highlighted the current market sentiment, noting a growing trend among investors actively diversifying their portfolios with Bitcoin. However, he pointed out a crucial barrier to a specific group of investors, particularly those in the advised market in the U.S., which is worth around a staggering $30 trillion. Regulatory constraints have prevented these investors from entering the crypto market.\n\nThe Grayscale CEO believes that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs could be a game-changer, providing a viable way for these investors to gain exposure to BTC. Grayscale has been working towards spot-based Bitcoin ETFs through its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product.\n\nLegal Challenges and Regulatory Progress\n\nGrayscale encountered regulatory problems last year when the SEC rejected its proposal to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot market Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale took legal action against the SEC, and approximately a year later, a federal judge ruled in their favour. The judge\u2019s decision mandated the SEC to reconsider Grayscale\u2019s application, emphasizing the importance of avoiding inconsistencies in regulatory decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis legal victory reflects Grayscale\u2019s persistence and shows the significance of a fair and consistent regulatory framework in crypto. The ongoing legal battles and regulatory developments show steps in the right direction for the growth of the crypto space.\n\nAs the crypto industry awaits regulatory approval for spot market Bitcoin ETFs, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein\u2019s positive outlook suggests that a significant financial wave, potentially reaching up to $30 trillion, could surge into the crypto market. The approval of these ETFs can streamline Bitcoin investments, allowing more investors to have exposure to digital assets.\n\nThe ongoing legal battles and regulatory developments highlight the dynamic landscape and growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, setting the stage for a new era in the crypto space. Investors and industry participants will follow these events as they unfold, as they could shape the future trajectory of Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole."

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nInvestors and enthusiasts are constantly on the lookout for promising crypto assets. Among these, Pullix (PLX), Bonk (BONK), and Ethereum (ETH) stand out as three cryptocurrencies that have garnered significant attention, especially during December.\n\nBonk (BONK): A Rising Star in the Cryptocurrency Sky\n\nBonk (BONK) has emerged as a noteworthy player in the crypto universe, particularly for those interested in meme coins. As a Solana-based meme coin, BONK transformed from a quirky airdrop into a viral sensation, witnessing an extraordinary price surge of over 25,000% within a year.\n\nIn the week leading up to the festive season, BONK experienced a 28.34% increase, showcasing its volatile yet potentially lucrative nature. Trading at $0.00001933, it held a remarkable 24-hour trading volume of approximately $459.81 million, placing it at the 24th position in market rankings.\n\nThis remarkable journey began with its launch via airdrop in late 2022, where it distributed its 100 trillion tokens, with 5% initially allocated to the team and later burned to aid in price stabilization. BONK's success story is reminiscent of other popular memecoins like Shiba Inu(SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), but it stands out as the first dog-themed memecoin on the Solana blockchain.\n\nThis distinct positioning, coupled with its integration into over 110 DeFi, gaming, developer, and exchange platforms, has not only fueled its rapid ascent but also cemented its status as a crypto asset with considerable community interest and market potential.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Backbone of Modern Blockchain Applications\n\nEthereum, known for its native cryptocurrency Ether (ETH), stands as a cornerstone in the blockchain world. With a significant price of $2,245.26, Ethereum has demonstrated a steady growth of 11.98% over the past month, reflecting Ethereum's enduring appeal and stability in the volatile crypto market.\n\nEthereum's prominence is further highlighted by its impressive 24-hour trading volume of $13.5 billion, solidifying its position as the third-ranked cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization.\n\nThis decentralized, open-source blockchain system is renowned not just for its cryptocurrency, but also for introducing smart contracts to the digital world. These self-executing Ethereum contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code have revolutionized various sectors, ranging from finance to gaming. Ethereum's ability to execute decentralized applications (dApps) has made it a favored platform for developers. Continuously, Ethereum is fostering innovation and new use cases in the blockchain space.\n\nPullix (PLX): Hybrid DeFi and AI Integration With a Twist\n\nPullix (PLX) is gearing up to be a game changer in the world of cryptocurrency exchanges. Operating under the innovative model of hybrid DeFi, Pullix aims to seamlessly merge the benefits of both decentralized and centralized exchanges. This upcoming trading platform is set to address one of the most pressing issues in the DeFi space \u2013 liquidity.\n\nAt its core, Pullix's mission is to provide a unified platform that simplifies access to liquidity and facilitates seamless trading of global assets. This approach not only tackles the liquidity problem head-on but also introduces a user-friendly interface, making it an attractive option for both novice and experienced traders. With the integration of AI-based trading tools, Pullix enhances the trading experience by offering features like improved order execution, profitable trade potential, and the unique opportunity for investors to copy trades from consistently successful traders.\n\nPullix is not just another trading platform; it's a comprehensive solution for a diverse range of trading requirements.

        "content": "The XRP Army has discovered an advertisement from Grayscale showcasing XRP alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum prices.\n\nChad Steingraber, a notable member of the XRP community and a professional game designer, brought attention to this development in a recent tweet.\n\nSteingraber shared a capture of CNBC\u2019s televised \u201ccrypto watch\u201d featuring the prices of three prominent cryptocurrencies. In particular, the exhibition showcased the market values of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMeanwhile, the display was a sponsored spotlight by the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency asset manager, Grayscale. Grayscale\u2019s choice to sponsor a display of XRP prices alongside the leading cryptocurrencies reignited speculation that the prominent asset manager could pursue an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\n\u201cTell me with a straight face that Grayscale isn\u2019t about to reboot their XRP ETF funds,\u201d Steingraber remarked.\n\nTell me with a straight face that Grayscale isn\u2019t about to reboot their #XRP ETF funds.. \ud83d\ude09 https://t.co/CdzxAGo1Vr pic.twitter.com/TqvnSu1WCV \u2014 Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) December 28, 2023\n\nWhy Grayscale XRP ETF is Likely\n\nRemember that Grayscale previously included XRP in its XRP Trust and GDLC products. However, in 2021, Grayscale removed XRP from its Digital Large Cap fund, a move that followed the SEC\u2019s assertion that XRP constituted an unregistered security.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nConcurrently, Grayscale initiated the dissolution of its standalone XRP Trust in response to the SEC\u2019s lawsuit. The firm explained that the legal action made it challenging for the Trust to convert XRP into dollars, particularly as several U.S.-based exchanges had delisted XRP.\n\nHowever, the new ad showcasing XRP alongside BTC and ETH has passed a message of hope for the XRP Army. Note that Grayscale is currently pushing to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a spot ETF.\n\nBesides, Grayscale is pursuing a similar quest to convert its Ethereum trust to an exchange-traded fund directly investing in ETH. The firm reportedly submitted a revised S-3 filing to the U.S. regulator when Barry Silbert, the CEO of its parent company, stepped down.\n\nUltimately, the recent advertisement featuring XRP\u2019s price alongside BTC and ETH has led the XRP community to speculate that Grayscale might be contemplating a move to reintroduce support for XRP. Moreover, XRP now has a clear regulatory status in the United States."

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nMarket watchers are optimistic about altcoins, forecasting their market cap could potentially double by the start of 2024. After a period of little action, we're now looking at a brighter horizon for those investing in alternative cryptocurrencies. The market's recent surge beyond its previous boundaries, now supported at stronger levels, hints at a potential tripling of its value in the near future.\n\nAmong these promising altcoins, Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Polygon (MATIC), Optimism (OP), and ScapesMania are particularly noteworthy. Excitement's building around these altcoins; their solid technical backing and growing momentum are catching serious attention in the market. Lately, the altcoin market has really picked up steam, smashing past that tough 200-week average and flipping what used to be stumbling blocks into springboards for growth.\n\nRide the Wave of Innovation with ScapesMania\n\nWhile some are facing an uncertain future, the trajectory of a presale project is far easier to predict. ScapesMania (MANIA) is a well-balanced, meticulously designed project that acts as a gaming ecosystem. Through DAO governance, backers will be able to influence and benefit from a multi-billion-dollar industry. A wide range of features paired with the best technology, a professional team, and a long-term, highly ambitious vision can make ScapesMania the next big thing in crypto. Presale discounts and stage bonuses only add to the project's appeal.\n\nPresale is Live Now \u2013 Join Now for a Chance to Benefit with MANIA\n\nBacked by an award-winning developer crew, ScapesMania stands for transparency. The project can achieve this not just by bringing big innovation to the game, but by putting its community front and center. Driving customer engagement and making sure that everyone benefits through great tokenomics and generous rewards is what makes ScapesMania the project with a bright future ahead.\n\nPresale is Live, Learn More About Major Benefits\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Trailblazer's Path Forward and Anticipated Future\n\nEthereum (ETH) has witnessed a significant increase in its price, particularly with the looming possibility of BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum spot ETF getting the green light. The current price of Ethereum stands at approximately $2,300, which is a 14% rise over the last month.\n\nIf the price continues to follow current trends, Ethereum (ETH) is predicted to see a price range between $2,244.23 and $6,373.37 in 2024. So, it looks like Ethereum has the potential to really take off, given the buzz about its new tech and how more people are jumping on board.\n\nField experts forecast Ethereum's value could surge to $28,000 upon ETF approval, an increase exceeding ten times its current price. The deflationary burn mechanism of Ethereum, combined with the expected influx of liquidity from the ETF, is predicted to substantially boost its price. Nevertheless, there's a perceived limit to its growth in the upcoming market cycle, with a more realistic peak being around $10,000.\n\nRipple (XRP): Charting Its Course Through Market Dynamics and Potential\n\nRecently, Ripple's (XRP) price experienced a surprising downturn to approximately $0.6320 during intra-day trading. This occurred despite an overall market uptrend. We partially attribute the decline to limited institutional interest, especially in comparison with alternatives such as Solana (SOL), which appears to impact its market value.\n\nIf the price continues to follow current trends, Ripple (XRP) is predicted to see a price range between $0.421062 and $1.710146 in 2024. Ripple has room for considerable gains if current favorable trends persist.\n\nRipple (XRP), despite its recent downturn, seems to be trending towards recovery and potentially surpassing its next significant resistance level. The future of Ripple's price could however suffer a bleak outlook in absence of institutional interest. In the short term, it showcases stronger recovery potential as it approaches the $0.644 resistance mark.\n\nPolygon (MATIC): Reflecting on the Consequences of Its Recent Successes\n\nPolygon (MATIC) has been on an upward trajectory over the past week, with its price chart showing a consistent green trend. Polygon (MATIC) surge in market value is likely linked to its recent milestones and a spike in users engaging with the network.\n\nIf the price continues to follow current trends, Polygon (MATIC) is predicted to see a price range between $0.868094 and $3.34 in 2024. This hints at a solid uptick for Polygon, fueled by hope in its wider use and tech strides.\n\nDespite the positive market movements and updates, Polygon (MATIC) might face a bearish trend. The token's Supply on Exchanges is higher than its Supply outside of Exchanges, indicating a potential for increased selling pressure. Despite a potential uptick in selling pressure, heavyweight investors' backing of Polygon (MATIC) hints at its ability to sustain an upward price trajectory.\n\nOptimism (OP): Striking a Balance Between Advancement and Community Expectations\n\nOptimism (OP) is currently navigating challenges related to the allocation of 30 million Optimism (OP) tokens, which are designated for providers of public goods and VC-backed projects. This heated discussion within the Optimism (OP) circle has definitely shaken up how holders see and value their tokens.\n\nIf the price continues to follow current trends, Optimism (OP) is predicted to see a price range between $3.20 and $4.53 in 2024. With its community's strong backing and a growing adoption rate, Optimism (OP) seems poised for a solid uptick in value within the next year.\n\nAmidst the debates, Optimism (OP) remains dedicated to honoring its contributors, this commitment could potentially catapult it towards a robust and supportive community. Optimism (OP) growth hinges on finding that sweet spot between scaling up and really tuning in to what the community is after.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the evolving cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Polygon (MATIC), and Optimism (OP) are emerging as significant players. Ethereum (ETH) is poised for substantial growth, potentially fueled by an ETF approval and its deflationary mechanism. Ripple (XRP), despite recent price dips, shows promise for recovery, contingent on attracting institutional interest. Polygon (MATIC) climb is impressive, but it's grappling with how to balance coins on the market and keep its investors' trust. Optimism (OP) is juggling the needs of its own team with what the wider community hopes to see, a balancing act that's key for making it big in the long run.\n\nEthereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Polygon (MATIC), and Optimism (OP) each bring their own set of hurdles and prospects to the table in a landscape where staying agile and forward-thinking is crucial. Staying ahead in the dynamic world of crypto hinges on their ability to innovate and pivot swiftly.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Despite the positive trend and increased network activity, Solana (SOL) is still down 89% from its peak, indicating a challenging journey ahead for full recovery.\n\nIf the price continues to follow current trends, Solana (SOL) is predicted to see a price range between $98.93 and $517.94 in 2024. Solana's price trajectory, given its tech leaps and savvy market play, hints at a sharp uptick from where it stands now.\n\nThe network's market value shows signs of a potential shift, with technical indicators suggesting a bearish trend might be looming. Keep an eye on the progress of Solana (SOL). Cautiously optimistic is the way to go, because if it picks up steam, we may see its value rise.\n\nCardano (ADA): Experiencing a Surge in Interest and Market Capitalization\n\nCardano (ADA) has recently added $1 billion to its market capitalization, a direct result of a 100% spike in trading volume, reflecting growing investor interest. With an over 180% increase in its total value locked (TVL) in its decentralized finance (DeFi) space, Cardano (ADA) market presence is strengthening.\n\nIf the price continues to follow current trends, Cardano (ADA) is predicted to see a price range between $0.560 and $3.11 in 2024. If Cardano continues along this trajectory, the potential price range from just over half a dollar to beyond three dollars by 2024 underscores the significant confidence placed in its cutting-edge tech and the role it's carving out in DeFi.\n\nAnalysts predict a potential massive surge in Cardano (ADA) value, suggesting a bullish future. However, the speculative nature of the market and the potential for corrections call for a cautious investment approach. While further growth in Cardano (ADA) price is anticipated, investors should remain alert to possible downturns.\n\nPolygon (MATIC): Gaining Attention with Strategic Moves\n\nPolygon (MATIC) has recently attracted significant attention due to a strategic partnership with Shell for supply chain management on its network. Polygon (MATIC) strides are really making waves, showing just how it's stepping up in practical uses out there. Sure, the crypto scene is buzzing with optimism and smart moves, but let's not forget that this market swings wildly, so a level head is key.\n\nIf the price continues to follow current trends, Polygon (MATIC) is predicted to see a price range between $0.868094 and $3.34 in 2024. This hints at a solid uptick for Polygon, fueled by hope in its wider use and tech strides.\n\nBig moves on the horizon for Polygon (MATIC), as recent splashes by big-time traders hint at its potential climb. However, investors should temper their expectations of moderate growth with the understanding that corrections are a possibility in the volatile crypto market.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the dynamic and ever-evolving cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) stand out as promising investments, each with its unique trajectory and potential for substantial growth. Amidst a vibe of cautious hope, we're seeing these cryptocurrencies really start to shake things up in the market. Ethereum (ETH) is drawing attention with its whale activities and network developments, suggesting a robust demand and a cautiously optimistic future. Solana (SOL), despite facing challenges, is on a recovery path with rising engagement and network activity, though it remains susceptible to market fluctuations. Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (MATIC) are experiencing surges in interest and strategic advancements, respectively. Cardano (ADA) spike in trading volume and DeFi space growth indicates a strengthening market presence and a bullish future, albeit with the need for cautious investment due to potential market corrections. Polygon\u2019s (MATIC) partnership with Shell and increasing whale activity point towards its growing relevance and potential for price growth, yet investors should remain aware of the inherent volatility in the crypto market.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin recently unveiled the Ethereum roadmap for 2024, revealing that the upcoming year would bring only minor alterations compared to the previous one.\n\nIn a series of informative posts shared on X (formerly Twitter), Buterin outlined the primary focal points for Ethereum in 2024, with the roadmap centered around six key components.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin provided in-depth insights into these six elements\u2014namely, the merge, the surge, the scourge, the verge, the purge, and the splurge\u2014accompanied by a detailed chart featuring annotations and diagrams.\n\nDespite the passage of time, Buterin pointed out that there were only minimal adjustments compared to the 2023 roadmap, emphasizing Ethereum\u2019s evolving and crystallizing technical direction: \u201cAs Ethereum\u2019s technical path forward continues to solidify, there are relatively few changes.\u201d\n\nOf paramount importance in this roadmap is \u201cThe Merge,\u201d which seeks to maintain a straightforward and robust proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus.\n\nThe Merge event took place in September 2022, marking the integration of the Ethereum mainnet with the proof-of-stake blockchain known as the Beacon Chain.\n\nREAD MORE: Chinese Authorities Escalate Crackdown on Cryptocurrency\n\nThis momentous transition led to a substantial reduction in Ethereum\u2019s overall energy consumption as it shifted away from the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism.\n\nIn a press release, Buterin also highlighted the progress made in Ethereum\u2019s single slot finality (SSF), an integral aspect of the post-Merge PoS improvement.\n\nSSF plays a pivotal role in ensuring that alterations to a blockchain block become irreversible without the burning of at least 33% of the total staked ETH.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe role of single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge PoS improvement is solidifying.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming clear that SSF is the easiest path to resolving a lot of the Ethereum PoS design\u2019s current weaknesses.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the technical aspects, Buterin\u2019s recent endeavors have included a desire to revive the original ideals of the \u201ccypherpunk\u201d revolution within the blockchain space.\n\nThe term \u201ccypherpunk\u201d refers to individuals who employ encryption to safeguard their privacy when accessing computer networks, particularly in the face of government surveillance.\n\nButerin elucidated in a blog post that Ethereum\u2019s initial vision revolved around being a \u201cpublic decentralized shared hard drive,\u201d capable of harnessing peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage.\n\nHowever, this vision waned in 2017 with the shift towards financialization on the Ethereum platform.\n\nNevertheless, Buterin acknowledged that concepts like rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and second-generation privacy solutions have gained prominence and have the potential to align with the values associated with cypherpunk principles.\n\nDiscover the Crypto Intelligence Blockchain Council"

The technology is excessively complex, and financial aspects are laden with intricate numerical details. Furthermore, the industry is plagued by a prevalence of scams.\n\nSome decentralized applications, often referred to as dapps in crypto parlance (although jargon itself is a concern), proudly emulate a visual style reminiscent of the early 1990s. This era harkens back to a time when engaging in enjoyable online activities required navigating through command lines.\n\nA noteworthy illustration of this phenomenon is MetaMask, the most widely utilized application within the Web3 framework.

These applications play a central role in safeguarding wealth, facilitating fund transactions, and orchestrating the management of one\u2019s Web3 existence. While MetaMask is certainly a competent wallet, the crypto industry, founded on the principle of trusting the invisible hand of the market, necessitates the presence of robust and competitive alternatives to ensure a dynamic ecosystem.\n\nRainbow Wallet stands out with its noteworthy features and integrations, making it a compelling choice for users in the crypto space:\n\nAPI Access:\n\n\u2013 Rainbow Wallet provides API access, enhancing its functionality and integrative capabilities.\n\nIntegrations:\n\nMintable\n\nSnowCone\n\nUnstoppable Domains\n\nWalletConnect\n\nX (Twitter)\n\nSpookySwap\n\nVezgo\n\nAutoMinter\n\nDEUS Finance\n\nDeri\n\nLlamaPay\n\nMyEtherWallet (MEW)\n\nNEAR\n\nNiftyzone\n\nTactic\n\nWanchain Wallet\n\nhop.cash\n\nRainbow Wallet\u2019s extensive list of integrations, ranging from popular platforms like Mintable and Unstoppable Domains to diverse decentralized finance (DeFi) projects such as DEUS Finance and SpookySwap, ensures a versatile and interconnected experience for users.\n\n\u2014> Use This Link to get 100x points on Rainbow! <\u2014\n\nHow Rainbow Points are distributed and how you can earn them?\n\nAnyone with an Ethereum wallet qualifies: Whether you\u2019re a seasoned crypto user or just starting out, owning an Ethereum wallet makes you eligible to earn Rainbow Points.\n\nSwitching from MetaMask to Rainbow?

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nTL;DR\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token has shown impressive performance this year, with significant growth in price and market capitalization, making it one of the top digital currencies in the market.\n\nFuture growth potential for SOL hinges on factors like technology adoption, overcoming past network issues, regulatory developments, and potential strategic partnerships, which could enhance its market value and utility.\n\nDespite its progress, SOL\u2019s market cap is still behind major players like Ethereum, but it has surpassed them in certain metrics like trading volume and NFT sales volume in recent times.\n\nCan Solana (SOL) Progress Even More Next Year?\n\nSolana\u2019s native token \u2013 SOL \u2013 has been a top performer this year, with its price reaching almost $125 earlier this week. The token has skyrocketed by over 1,000% since January 1, while its market capitalization briefly surpassed the $50 billion mark and is currently standing at around $48 billion (per CoinGecko\u2019s data).\n\nThis uptrend has made SOL the fourth-largest digital currency in the entire market, outpacing Binance Coin (BNB) and Ripple (XRP).\n\nIn the following lines we will take a deeper dive and check whether the asset\u2019s progress could continue next year with SOL becoming the biggest alternative coin in the realm.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, such a scenario is not out of the cards but hinges on on multiple elements. One major factor is the possible adoption of the asset\u2019s technology and network. Solana is known for its low costs and fast transaction speed, which makes it a preferred ecosystem for decentralized applications.\n\nThe AI-powered chatbot also estimated that SOL\u2019s future success depends on coping with some issues that have caused reputational damage to the blockchain protocol in the past. Recall that Solana has experienced numerous network outages in the last few years.\n\nRegulatory development was also outlined as a vital factor. According to ChatGPT, the implementation of favorable rules in the crypto industry could have a positive impact on SOL.\n\nLast but not least, the chatbot pointed out possible partnerships that the blockchain entity might strike up with prominent organizations. Such strategic collaborations could enhance SOL\u2019s utility and adoption, potentially boosting its market value.\n\nDespite its rapid recent progress, SOL\u2019s market capitalization is still far from Ethereum\u2019s (almost $270 billion) and the one of USDT ($91 billion), meaning it has a long way to go before being throned as the largest altcoin.\n\nSolana has Already Surpassed Ethereum in These Metrics\n\nIt is worth noting that Solana has performed better than its rival for the top \u2013 Ethereum \u2013 in some aspects. According to DefiLlama, trading volume on Solana has surged above $1.3 billion in the past few days. For the most part of the month, Ethereum was lagging behind.\n\nSOL Trading Volume, Source: DefiLlama\n\nSolana has also performed quite well in the non-fungible token space, registering an NFT sales volume of over $88 million in the last week. Ethereum has fallen behind with approximately $74 million for the same period.\n\nWhat is more, Solana flipped Ethereum in terms of search volumes on Google, which is a testament to the growing interest in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe post We Asked ChatGPT if Solana (SOL) Can Become the Biggest Altcoin in 2024 appeared first on CryptoPotato."

        "content": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has shared the crypto project\u2019s roadmap for 2024. In a series of posts on X on December 30, Buterin spoke extensively on Ethereum\u2019s gameplan for the new year, which he claims is quite similar to the plan for 2023, albeit with a few changes.\n\nEthereum Roadmap 2024\n\nAccording to information revealed by Buterin, the main focus of Ethereum for 2024 centers around six key goals, namely the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge aims to create an ideal, simple, robust, and decentralized proof-of-stake (PoS) network.\n\nThe Merge occurred in September 2022 with the integration of the Ethereum mainnet with the Beacon Chain, thus marking the end of the proof-of-work consensus algorithm. Speaking on post-Merge improvements in 2024, Buterin claimed that the single-slot finality (SSF) mechanism presented the easiest method of eliminating the current restrictions of Ethereum\u2019s PoS design.\n\n\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nIn regards to the Surge, Buterin stated that there will be notable advancements in rollup scaling with significant developments both on EIP 4844 and within various rollups. Additionally, there will be a focus on long-term improvement in cross-rollup standards and interoperability, all of which will drive Ethereum toward achieving the goal of processing over 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder also highlighted that the Scourge target has been re-oriented to tackling economic centralization in two key areas namely MEV and liquid staking/pooling. In addition, Buterin stated that there will be significant progress in achieving the Verge with the incoming introduction of verkle trees, which will contribute to the easy verification of blocks in the Ethereum network.\n\nButerin Faces Allegations From Former Ethereum Foundation Advisor\n\nIn other news, Buterin has been accused of \u201cdefrauding the world\u201d by former Ethereum Foundation adviser Steven Nerayoff. This statement came in response to Buterin\u2019s concerns about the perversion of the original vision of Web 3.\n\nIn a blog post on Dec 28, the Ethereum founder shared that the blockchain project was initially designed to function as a decentralized, shared hard drive. However, users have since diverted from the vision with a focus more on the financial applications of Ethereum.\n\nNerayoff countered Buterin\u2019s claims, stating that the Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, along with \u201chis cabal,\u201d are responsible for the perversion of the \u201cWeb 3 vision,\u201d which they used to \u201cdefraud the world.\u201d So far, there has been no response to these accusations.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,285.41 with a 0.81 decline in the last day. Meanwhile, the token\u2019s daily trading volume is down by 36.68% and valued at $6.84 billion.\n\nETH trading at $2,285.41 on the daily chart | Source: ETHUSDT chart on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Forbes, chart from Tradingview"

        "content": "The percentage of long-term ETH holders has skyrocketed this year to surpass Bitcoin for the second time ever. According to data from on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, Ethereum has done pretty well in its percentage of long-term holders this year, with over 70% of investors currently holding on to their assets for more than a year, a new milestone for the blockchain.\n\nETH Long-Term Holders Now Top BTC\n\nEthereum\u2019s price activity has largely underperformed this year when compared to Bitcoin. But this isn\u2019t surprising, as Bitcoin has led the entire industry in bullish metrics and investor confidence this year. However, data from IntoTheBlock suggest more Ethereum investors are holding onto ETH for the long haul, hopefully with the belief that it will continue to rise substantially in value over time.\n\nLong-term holders are investors who refuse to sell their crypto even during times of market volatility and price depreciation. They are particularly important in maintaining the overall health of any blockchain, as they help to provide stability and reduce price volatility.\n\nHistory has shown Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin as regards this metric only once before. It\u2019s important to note that the last time this happened, ETH would go on to lead in this metric over the subsequent months.\n\n2023 Review! This year, the percent of long-term $ETH holders surpassed that of Bitcoin for the second time ever! pic.twitter.com/i6kDzAjzgM \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 30, 2023\n\nOn the other hand, In/Out of the Money metric by IntoTheBlock shows Bitcoin leading Ethereum in terms of profitability. At the time of writing, 82.25% of all BTC addresses are making money at the current price, compared to 76.10% of ETH addresses.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s high profitability can be linked to a huge number of early Bitcoins assumed to be lost forever. As a result, the percentage of holders who bought at the current price metric puts Ethereum ahead of Bitcoin.\n\nTotal crypto market cap is currently at $1.6 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nAround 63% of ETH addresses who bought around the current price of $1,948 and $2,641 are still in profit compared to BTC\u2019s 52% of addresses that bought between $35,729 and $48,402.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is currently trading at $2,285 and is up by 91% this year. However, the asset\u2019s price has largely underperformed in comparison to major altcoins like Solana and Cardano, who are currently up by 925% and 145% respectively this year.\n\nInterestingly, this hasn\u2019t stopped bullish predictions from coming in regarding Ethereum. One of these is a prediction from BitMex founder Arthur Hayes, who estimated an astounding $5,000 price for Ethereum. Crypto analyst Raoul Pau also looked at price history to predict ETH outperforming BTC becoming a key macro trend of 2024. The first step in achieving this would be to break above the $2,380 price level.\n\nFor all the ETH bears\u2026 in Feb 2021, BTC first hit $44,000 (where it is today) and ETH was at $1400 (now $2250), 9 months later ETH was up 245%, BTC was up 45%\u2026 I think ETH outperforming BTC will be a key macro trend of 2024 and our work at EXPAAM suggests it. 1/ pic.twitter.com/QGSZahhldg \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 21, 2023\n\nFeatured image from Pexels"

Forks can be both planned and unplanned, driven by disputes within the crypto community or the need for technical improvements. Among these, hard forks stand out as the most significant, resulting in an irreversible separation of the blockchain and the introduction of a new protocol that is entirely incompatible with the old one. Hard forks are frequently employed to create new cryptocurrencies and launch innovative blockchain projects.\n\nEthereum\u2019s prominence in the crypto space\n\nEthereum, with its substantial market capitalization, holds a prominent position in the world of blockchain. It has become the preferred choice for various purposes, including token issuance, decentralized platform creation, and the trading of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The Ethereum network witnesses daily transaction volumes worth billions of dollars, with an additional $28.4 billion locked within it through third-party products and services. Ethereum\u2019s success can be attributed in part to its active and engaged cryptocurrency community, which consistently implements systematic changes to enhance the network\u2019s capabilities.\n\nEthereum hard Forks and their significance\n\nEthereum, like many other blockchain networks, has experienced both soft and hard forks as part of its continuous development. To better understand Ethereum\u2019s hard forks, it\u2019s informative to reference notable hard forks in other blockchain networks, particularly Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin, the pioneering blockchain network created by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto, has also undergone several significant hard forks in its history. These include Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Segregated Witness (SegWit), Bitcoin Cash, among others. What these forks share in common with Ethereum\u2019s hard forks is their aim to implement protocol upgrades through network consensus.\n\nEthereum\u2019s hard forks have been prompted by a variety of concerns and challenges. These encompass issues related to security, decentralization, transaction fees, scalability, and limitations associated with ETH 1.0. Notably, Ethereum is more than just a digital currency; it serves as a versatile platform for a wide range of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Consequently, Ethereum\u2019s development roadmap has evolved to meet the diverse needs of its user base.\n\nEthereum\u2019s developmental roadmap\n\nEthereum\u2019s developmental roadmap consists of four main stages: Frontier, Homestead, Metropolis, and Serenity. Unlike many Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks primarily focused on cryptocurrency, Ethereum has had to adapt and expand its capabilities to accommodate a multitude of use cases and features. This roadmap serves as a guiding framework for Ethereum\u2019s ongoing development and improvement, with each stage addressing specific challenges and opportunities.\n\nFrontier Thawing\n\nThe Frontier Thawing hard fork, which came into effect on September 7, 2015, at block number 200,000, marked a crucial juncture in Ethereum\u2019s early development. Its significance lies in multiple facets. First, it introduced the concept of the \u201cdifficulty bomb,\u201d a mechanism designed to increase the mining process\u2019s complexity gradually. This served as a vital step in Ethereum\u2019s transition from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the more eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Furthermore, Frontier Thawing lifted the 5,000 gas limit per block, enhancing the network\u2019s capacity to handle transactions efficiently. This hard fork was not just about theoretical changes; it introduced concrete improvements, bolstering Ethereum\u2019s security and speed.

Its significance lies in its role as a milestone, marking Ethereum\u2019s departure from the beta phase and its entry into a more mature stage of development. This hard fork was driven by Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) such as EIP-2, EIP-7, and EIP-8. These EIPs ushered in protocol improvements aimed at refining smart contract creation and development protocol forward compatibility. Homestead, in essence, paved the way for Ethereum\u2019s growth by bolstering the network\u2019s robustness. Its strategic implementation and adherence to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal process demonstrated Ethereum\u2019s commitment to systematic upgrades and its continued journey towards mainstream adoption.\n\nThe DAO Fork\n\nThe DAO Fork, executed on July 20, 2016, marks one of the most pivotal moments in Ethereum\u2019s history. Its significance transcends technical updates, as it emerged in response to a critical vulnerability \u2013 the DAO attack, resulting in the loss of 3.6 million ETH. Ethereum\u2019s response was swift and impactful. The community voted to move the affected funds to a new contract, allowing original owners to withdraw their funds at a rate of 1 ETH for every 100 DAO tokens held. However, this solution led to a schism within the Ethereum community, giving rise to two separate blockchains \u2013 Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The DAO Fork, therefore, became a touchstone for Ethereum\u2019s governance and direction, reflecting the community\u2019s values and its commitment to security and integrity.\n\nByzantium\n\nThe Byzantium hard fork, integral to Ethereum\u2019s Metropolis upgrade, represents a critical juncture in the platform\u2019s development. This hard fork, executed on October 16, 2017, at block 4,370,000, brought forth significant enhancements. Key Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) introduced during Byzantium included EIP-100, which revamped the difficulty adjustment formula, resulting in a more consistent block time. EIP-197 and EIP-198 introduced ZK-Snarks, a form of zero-knowledge cryptography that bolstered privacy. EIP-649 delayed the difficulty bomb by one year and reduced mining rewards from 5 ETH to 3 ETH, mitigating inflation. Byzantium thus paved the way for future scaling solutions, curbed ETH inflation, and introduced functionalities that allowed the development of more complex smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network.\n\nConstantinople\n\nThe Constantinople hard fork, implemented on February 28, 2019, at block 7,280,000, marked a significant stride in Ethereum\u2019s journey towards Ethereum 2.0 while focusing on efficiency and economics. Notable EIPs included EIP-145, which introduced native bitwise shifting instructions to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EIP-1234 delayed the difficulty bomb for approximately 12 months and reduced block rewards from 3 ETH to 2 ETH. Constantinople\u2019s role was paramount in optimizing Ethereum\u2019s overall efficiency and economic sustainability, aligning it with Ethereum 2.0\u2019s long-term scaling strategy. This fork was a crucial step in Ethereum\u2019s evolution, preparing the network for the transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nIstanbul\n\nIstanbul, activated on December 8, 2019, at block 9,069,000, was designed to enhance Ethereum\u2019s compatibility with other protocols and improve its overall performance. It introduced several pivotal Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that significantly impacted the network. EIP-152 facilitated interoperability between Ethereum and the Zcash blockchain. EIP-1108 reduced gas costs for privacy and scaling solutions like SNARKs and STARKs, enhancing scalability and privacy. EIP-1884 increased gas costs for certain EVM operations, fortifying the network against spam attacks. EIP-2028 further reduced gas costs, aiding in Layer 2 scaling solutions like Plasma. Istanbul, in essence, elevated Ethereum\u2019s scalability, privacy, and resilience to denial-of-service attacks, streamlining the platform for developers and users alike.\n\nBeacon Chain\n\nThe Beacon Chain hard fork, launched on December 1, 2020, marked a crucial milestone in Ethereum\u2019s planned transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The Beacon Chain introduced PoS to Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, revolutionizing its security and decentralization mechanisms. In PoS, validators lock up ETH as collateral to validate transactions and secure the network. This shift enhances security by discouraging malicious actors, as they risk losing their staked ETH. Moreover, it promotes decentralization by allowing more participants to become validators, reducing the influence of centralized mining pools. The Beacon Chain continues to play a vital role in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, managing the PoS protocol while upholding the network\u2019s state and transaction processing in a separate execution layer.\n\nLondon Upgrade\n\nThe London upgrade, implemented in August 2021, introduced Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, fundamentally altering the network\u2019s transaction fee model. EIP-1559 introduced a new transaction fee structure that includes a base fee burned with each transaction, thereby reducing the supply of ETH over time. This innovation was a pivotal move toward economic sustainability for Ethereum. By curbing excessive gas fees and providing a predictable fee structure, EIP-1559 improved the user experience and made Ethereum more accessible for a broader range of participants. This upgrade was essential to ensure that Ethereum remains a viable platform for users and developers while addressing concerns about escalating transaction costs.\n\nThe Merge\n\nThe Merge, executed on September 15, 2022, stands as one of the most transformative moments in Ethereum\u2019s history. It signifies the complete transition from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) to the environmentally friendly Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This transition resulted in an astounding reduction of approximately 99.95% in energy consumption, effectively addressing one of the main criticisms of blockchain technology. Beyond its environmental benefits, The Merge has significant implications for scalability and security. The PoS mechanism enhances security by requiring validators to lock up ETH as collateral, and it lays the groundwork for Ethereum\u2019s future scalability solutions, ensuring its sustainability and continued growth.\n\nShanghai-Capella\n\nTechnically executed on the same day, April 12, 2023, at block 17,034,870, Shanghai and Capella are pivotal hard forks that have a shared goal: to facilitate staking withdrawals. Shanghai introduced the capability for staking withdrawals on the execution layer, while Capella upgraded the Beacon Chain, enabling blocks to accept withdrawal operations. These forks play a crucial role in enhancing the liquidity, security, and decentralization of staked assets. By making staking more accessible and flexible, they encourage more users to become validators, further strengthening the Ethereum network. These upgrades are a testament to Ethereum\u2019s commitment to optimizing its staking ecosystem and ensuring the security and liquidity of participants\u2019 assets.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey through its ten most significant hard forks has been transformative. Each fork, from Frontier Thawing\u2019s foundation-laying to The Merge\u2019s monumental shift to Proof-of-Stake, has propelled Ethereum\u2019s evolution.

        "title": "How EIP-7514 Will Change Ethereum Staking - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Ethereum, a pioneering blockchain platform, has seen a remarkable surge in staking activity. Staking, a crucial aspect of blockchain networks, involves participants locking up their cryptocurrency holdings to support and secure the network\u2019s operations. In Ethereum\u2019s case, this entails locking up Ether (ETH), the platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat\u2019s truly noteworthy is the speed at which staking has grown within the Ethereum ecosystem. This rapid expansion reflects the community\u2019s enthusiasm for participating in network validation and earning rewards. However, as Ethereum\u2019s staking volume continues to skyrocket, concerns have arisen regarding potential challenges that could impact the network\u2019s stability and incentives for stakers. So, let\u2019s find out more about EIP-7514.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Staking\n\nEthereum staking is a fundamental mechanism that underpins the security and functionality of the Ethereum network. It involves participants, known as validators, locking up a portion of their Ether (ETH) holdings as collateral to support various network operations. In return for their active involvement, validators are rewarded with additional ETH tokens. This process represents a significant departure from the traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism and forms the cornerstone of Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nThe importance of staking lies in its ability to enhance network security and scalability while reducing its environmental footprint. By staking their ETH, validators essentially vouch for the validity of transactions and the integrity of new blocks added to the blockchain. In doing so, they contribute to Ethereum\u2019s decentralization, making it more resilient to attacks and censorship.\n\nValidators are motivated to participate in staking by the promise of rewards. These rewards serve as incentives for validators to act honestly and fulfill their role in securing the network. The longer validators commit their ETH and actively participate, the greater their potential rewards. It encourages long-term engagement and fosters a sense of responsibility among validators.\n\nIn essence, Ethereum staking plays a pivotal role in the evolution of the network, offering both security and the opportunity for token holders to actively contribute to its operation while earning rewards for their efforts.\n\nThe Concerns with Rapid Staking Growth\n\nThe rapid and exponential growth of staking on the Ethereum network has raised concerns among developers and stakeholders. While staking was introduced to bolster network security and encourage active participation, its unforeseen surge has brought several challenges.\n\nOne significant issue stems from the strain imposed on the Ethereum network due to the substantial increase in validators. As more participants engage in staking, the number of validators and their corresponding responsibilities escalate. This results in a surge in network traffic, leading to congestion and slower transaction processing times. The strain on the consensus layer, responsible for confirming transactions, grows exponentially with the expansion of staking.\n\nMoreover, as more ETH is staked, the rewards earned by validators are distributed among a larger pool of participants. This dilution of rewards means that individual validators may receive smaller payouts than when the staking pool was smaller. It could potentially discourage long-term staking and active participation in the network.\n\nPerhaps the most alarming concern is the possibility that a substantial portion of Ethereum\u2019s total Ether supply will be staked. According to projections, as much as 50% of all Ether could be staked by May 2024, with the potential to reach 100% by December 2024. While high staking levels theoretically increase network security, they also present the risk of depleting the available supply of Ether for regular transactions.\n\nThese challenges necessitate careful consideration and proactive measures to ensure the continued stability and functionality of the Ethereum network. Ethereum Improvement Proposal 7514 (EIP-7514) has emerged as a potential solution to address these concerns and strike a balance between fostering staking growth and maintaining network efficiency.\n\nIntroduction to EIP-7514\n\nEIP-7514, short for Ethereum Improvement Proposal 7514, emerges as a pivotal solution in the Ethereum ecosystem, strategically designed to tackle a pressing issue: unprecedented staking growth. Within Ethereum\u2019s continuous evolution, this proposal stands as a beacon of change, seeking to address the challenges that have arisen due to the rapid expansion of staking activities.\n\nThe need for EIP-7514 stems from the remarkable surge in Ethereum staking, which, while intended to fortify network security and incentivize active participation, has also introduced various unforeseen complications. These complications encompass network congestion, diluted rewards for validators, and the prospect of a substantial portion of Ether being staked, potentially affecting regular transactions.\n\nEIP-7514 emerges as a proactive response to these challenges, aiming to strike a delicate balance between fostering the growth of staking, ensuring network efficiency, and preserving Ethereum\u2019s long-term sustainability. In essence, it acts as a critical piece of the Ethereum puzzle, offering solutions to the burgeoning staking landscape while safeguarding the integrity of the network.\n\nHow EIP-7514 Works\n\nEIP-7514, at its core, introduces a crucial change to the Ethereum network\u2019s staking dynamics. At the heart of this proposal lies the concept of a lower churn limit, a pivotal element that serves to reshape the landscape of Ethereum staking.\n\nAs proposed by EIP-7514, the lower churn limit sets a maximum threshold on the number of validators that can be added to the network within a specified time frame. Unlike the previous model, where validator activations could grow exponentially, this new approach introduces a more linear and controlled growth pattern.\n\nThe primary objective of this lower churn limit is to curb the rapid rate of staking within the Ethereum ecosystem. By capping the number of new validators that can join the network at a given time, EIP-7514 seeks to slow down the staking influx. This deliberate reduction in the pace of staking activities serves a crucial purpose \u2013 it provides the Ethereum community with the time and space needed to explore and implement sustainable, long-term solutions.\n\nIn essence, EIP-7514 is not a final remedy but a strategic maneuver to buy time and deliberate on more permanent measures. By imposing restrictions on activating new validators, it aims to alleviate the pressure on the Ethereum network, ensuring smooth operations. At the same time, preparations are made to address the challenges posed by the exponential growth of staking.\n\nCommunity Responses\n\nWithin the Ethereum community, EIP-7514 has sparked a spectrum of opinions and reactions, reflecting the diverse perspectives that contribute to the network\u2019s development.\n\nAdvocates of EIP-7514 argue passionately in favor of its implementation. They stress the importance of research, analysis, and thoughtful decision-making in the face of Ethereum\u2019s rapid growth. These proponents maintain that the lower churn limit proposed by EIP-7514 is necessary to prevent the network from being overwhelmed by staking activities. They view it as a prudent measure to buy time and space for the community to explore and implement sustainable solutions that can ensure Ethereum\u2019s long-term stability.\n\nConversely, critics within the Ethereum community have expressed reservations about the proposal. Some believe that EIP-7514 was introduced hastily without sufficient deliberation. They argue that the urgency to cap validator growth doesn\u2019t align with the steadily shrinking activation queue. These skeptics question whether the proposal\u2019s rushed nature might compromise Ethereum\u2019s commitment to network neutrality, a core principle that sets Ethereum apart in the competitive crypto landscape.\n\nThe discourse surrounding EIP-7514 is emblematic of Ethereum\u2019s dynamic and collaborative governance model, where divergent viewpoints merge to shape the network\u2019s future. It signifies a commitment to addressing challenges and ensuring Ethereum remains resilient and adaptable in a constantly evolving ecosystem.\n\nPotential Impact on Ethereum Staking\n\nThe introduction of Ethereum Improvement Proposal 7514 (EIP-7514) represents a pivotal moment in Ethereum staking. This proposal, aimed at addressing the exponential growth in staking activities, has the potential to usher in significant changes with far-reaching implications.\n\nForemost, EIP-7514 seeks to slow down the rapid expansion of staking on the Ethereum network. The current trajectory suggests that an astonishing 50% of all Ether in circulation could be staked by May 2024 and a staggering 100% by December 2024. While this might seem like a show of community participation, it raises concerns about network stability and the sustainability of staking incentives.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is network strain. As more Ether is staked, the Ethereum network experiences increased activity, leading to congestion and potential bottlenecks in transaction processing. That could hinder the network\u2019s efficiency and ability to handle the growing load of staking-related activities.\n\nMoreover, the rapid staking growth could dilute staking rewards. As more participants stake their Ether, the rewards per staked Ether may decrease, potentially discouraging long-term staking commitments. It challenges Ethereum\u2019s goal of creating a secure and robust staking ecosystem.\n\nIn the competitive crypto landscape, Ethereum has prided itself on its commitment to network neutrality and adaptability. EIP-7514, while a temporary measure to alleviate immediate concerns, may impact Ethereum\u2019s standing. The rush to implement the proposal has sparked debates about the network\u2019s governance and decision-making processes.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to view EIP-7514 as the Ethereum community\u2019s proactive step to manage the risks associated with rapid growth. This proposal buys valuable time for Ethereum developers and stakeholders to explore and implement long-term solutions to address the challenges of extensive staking while ensuring Ethereum remains a secure, efficient, and competitive blockchain platform.\n\nAs the Ethereum network continues to evolve and adapt, the potential impact of EIP-7514 on staking and Ethereum\u2019s role in the crypto landscape remains a subject of intense discussion and scrutiny within the community.\n\nFuture Implications of EIP-7514\n\nThe Ethereum network has experienced significant volatility since its inception, and EIP-7514 could be likened to hitting the \u201cpause\u201d button. This proposal gives the Ethereum community the breathing room to deliberate and make more informed decisions about the network\u2019s future. It represents a moment of reflection and consideration for the community to navigate the complexities and challenges that may arise in the blockchain space.\n\nThe discourse surrounding EIP-7514 highlights the dynamic nature of Ethereum\u2019s governance and the community\u2019s proactive approach to addressing emerging issues. Evaluating EIP-7514 requires careful consideration of its long-term implications, as it could potentially establish a precedent for dealing with unforeseen challenges.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposal 7514 (EIP-7514) marks a significant development in Ethereum staking. The explosive growth of staking on the Ethereum network has presented opportunities and challenges, making it imperative for the community to take proactive measures.\n\nEIP-7514 serves as a crucial intervention to slow the pace of staking, offering a respite from the looming possibility of 50% of Ether being staked by May 2024 and 100% by December 2024. This measured approach seeks to address concerns related to network strain and the potential dilution of staking rewards, preserving the long-term viability of Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem.\n\nBeyond its immediate impact, EIP-7514 highlights the dynamic nature of Ethereum\u2019s governance and decision-making processes. It underscores the Ethereum community\u2019s commitment to adaptability and willingness to address emerging challenges promptly. As Ethereum continues to evolve, its governance decisions have far-reaching implications for the broader crypto industry, setting the stage for future developments and innovations.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey exemplifies the industry\u2019s resilience and capacity for evolution in a rapidly changing crypto landscape. EIP-7514 is not merely a proposal; it represents Ethereum\u2019s ongoing commitment to secure, efficient, and competitive blockchain solutions, making it an exciting space to watch for all stakeholders and enthusiasts."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin presents Ethereum\u2019s 2024 roadmap, focusing on scalability, security, and efficiency.\n\nInnovations include The Meltdown, The Boom, The Purge, and more, seeking to robust Ethereum and enhance its cyberpunk ethos.\n\nVitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has unveiled Ethereum\u2019s updated 2024 roadmap, which continues last year\u2019s ambitious plans with some refinements and continued emphasis on certain key areas.\n\nThe roadmap focuses on six key components \u2013 The Merge (The Merge), The Surge (The Surge), The Scourge (The Scourge), The Verge (The Verge), The Purge (The Purge) and The Splurge (The Splurge) .\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nEach of these elements plays a crucial role in shaping the future of the Ethereum network, with the goal of making it more robust, scalable, efficient and aligned with its original cyberpunk ethos.\n\nThe Merge\n\nThis crucial component was already implemented in 2022 with the shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS)consensus mechanism . The Merge marked a significant reduction in Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption and laid the groundwork for future upgrades. Buterin emphasized the importance of maintaining a simple and resilient PoS consensus, stressing its importance for network stability and efficiency.\n\nThe Surge\n\nThe Surge seeks to significantly improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability by implementing data fragmentation. Fragmentation involves splitting the blockchain into smaller segments, which can process transactions and store data more efficiently.\n\nThis upgrade is expected to increase network capacity and reduce transaction costs, contributing to Ethereum\u2019s scalability goals, including achieving 100,000 transactions per second on Ethereum and its Layer 2 networks.\n\nThe Scourge\n\nAddressing security concerns is a priority in The Scourge. It focuses on mitigating potential security vulnerabilities and improving the robustness of the network. This includes exploring new consensus mechanisms and improving the security of smart contracts, as well as addressing issues related to Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and liquidity pooling.\n\nThe Verge\n\nThis component seeks to simplify user experiences and improve developer tools. The goal is to simplify the Ethereum interface and improve the development process for decentralized apps (dApps) and other applications. Easier block verification is part of this update, making the network more accessible and easier to use.\n\nThe Purge\n\nIn the Purge, the focus is on cleaning up the Ethereum protocol by removing obsolete or unnecessary code. This streamlining aims to improve the overall efficiency of the network and reduce potential security risks associated with old or disused code. It is a process of continuous refinement to keep the network agile and efficient.\n\nThe Splurge\n\nThe Splurge is essentially an investment in the future of Ethereum. It includes research and development of emerging technologies and potential breakthroughs for the Ethereum network. This includes exploring zero-knowledge proofs (zero-knowledge proofs), rollups and other privacy-enhancing solutions. It is a commitment to innovation and staying at the forefront of blockchain technology.\n\nIn addition to these technical updates, Buterin also emphasized the need to revive Ethereum\u2019s original cyberpunk vision. This vision includes a focus on decentralized applications, privacy protection and peer-to-peer communication.\n\nThe integration of technologies such as rollups and zero-knowledge proofs is seen as a step toward restoring this ethos and enabling the development of more private and censorship-resistant applications on Ethereum.\n\nFinally, Buterin endorsed single-space finality (SSF) as the simplest way to address many of the current weaknesses in Ethereum\u2019s PoS design. Advances made in Layer 2 networks and Verkle tree implementations were also praised, indicating a healthy development trajectory for the network.\n\nThe Ethereum 2024 roadmap, as outlined by Buterin, indicates a continued commitment to improving the scalability, efficiency, security and usability of the network. It also reflects a desire to return to the network\u2019s original principles of decentralization and privacy, ensuring Ethereum\u2019s relevance and utility in the evolving digital landscape.\n\n."

        "content": "Activity in Ethereum L2 increases markedly in 2023, with transactions in Arbitrum and Optimism growing significantly, driving their prices upwards.\n\nTechnical analysis reveals fluctuations in ARB and OP, with upside reversal potential for ARB and volatility forecast for OP.\n\nThe year 2023 has witnessed a significant change in the Ethereum ecosystem, with a notable increase in activity in its Layer Two (L2) protocols. According to IntoTheBlock, a blockchain intelligence firm, transactions on L2s increased 90 times compared to 2021. This change is due to the adoption of scalability solutions such as Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP), which has had a noticeable impact on both their usage and the value of their native tokens.\n\nTroubleshooting Scalability Issues in Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s L2s were developed to solve scalability issues faced by users on the main chain, which processes approximately 15 transactions per second and carries high gas rates. Optimistic rollups, including Arbitrum and Optimism, allow users to process transactions with increased speed and at reduced costs.\n\nIn 2023, activity on Ethereum has increasingly moved to L2s, with L2 transactions increasing by 90x compared to 2021 pic.twitter.com/FhWJ1WG2ju \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 30, 2023\n\nARB and OP Price Impact\n\nThe price of ARB has risen 54% in the last 90 days, while OP has enjoyed a 170% increase over the same period. These returns have led to ARB and OP being considered tokens to watch in 2024.\n\nTechnical Analysis of Arbitrum (ARB)\n\nDespite reaching a high of $1.64 on Dec. 28, ARB faced rejection and its price fell to $1.44. Technical analysis suggests possible additional selling pressure.\n\nThe Aroon indicator signals a bearish trend, with a chance of losing support at $1.40. However, there is support at $1.29 that could lead to a short-term bounce. The Money Flow Index (MFI) indicates that ARB is oversold, which could precede a reversal to the upside.\n\nOptimism Technical Analysis (OP)\n\nOP\u2019s market structure is similar to that of ARB. It is currently trading at $3.63, with Bollinger Bands (BB) indicating high volatility. This suggests significant fluctuations in price. If selling pressure increases, OP could fall to $3.34, but an increase in buying pressure could take it towards $4.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that buyers don\u2019t have much control, which could result in a drop below $3.63 if the bulls don\u2019t intervene.\n\nChanges for Ethereum L2 and Its Tokens\n\nIncreasing activity on Ethereum\u2019s L2s, especially Arbitrum and Optimism, shows a significant shift in user preference and a potential positive impact on the value of its tokens. As Ethereum continues to scale and offer more efficient solutions, ARB and OP are shaping up to be key assets in the cryptocurrency landscape. However, investors and users need to keep an eye on market trends and technical analysis to trade in this sector.\n\n."

        "content": "In a recent development, Vitalik Buterin, the pioneering mind behind Ethereum, has revealed the much-awaited Ethereum roadmap for 2024, indicating a limited divergence from the preceding year. In a recent X post, Buterin emphasized the primary focal points shaping Ethereum\u2019s direction in 2024, detailing six critical components.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nIn an exhaustive breakdown, meticulously presented through an elaborate chart adorned with precise annotations and thorough diagrams, a comprehensive exploration unfolded concerning these six fundamental elements: the merge, the surge, the scourge, the verge, the purge, and the splurge. Buterin stressed the roadmap\u2019s stability:\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s technical path forward continues to solidify, there are relatively few changes.\n\nOne of the crucial aspects of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain technology is the \u201cMerge,\u201d which plays a central role in maintaining a streamlined and robust proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus. This significant development was accomplished in September 2022 by merging the ETH mainnet with a proof-of-stake blockchain, the Beacon Chain. The successful implementation of Merge has led to an amalgamation of two distinct blockchains, resulting in an efficient and secure network that can meet the demands of modern business and academic settings.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Transformation: PoW to PoS And SSF Advancements\n\nFollowing the completion of the merger, Ethereum underwent a significant transformation, transitioning from a power-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, substantially reducing the network\u2019s energy consumption. This shift to PoS is noteworthy as it has enabled ETH to operate more efficiently while reducing its carbon footprint.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin explained Ethereum\u2019s progress in single-slot finality (SSF). This important aspect guarantees irreversible blockchain block changes without staking at least 33% of the total ETH.\n\nThe role of single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge PoS improvement is solidifying. It's becoming clear that SSF is the easiest path to resolving a lot of the Ethereum PoS design's current weaknesses.\n\n\n\nSee:https://t.co/l8OcVsXCOWhttps://t.co/8sM6DieMjg pic.twitter.com/i6Gz36huW4 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nAddressing ETH\u2019s original vision, Buterin revisited its inception as a \u201cpublic decentralized, shared hard drive,\u201d focusing on peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage. He acknowledged a shift away from this vision in 2017 toward the financialization of Ethereum.\n\nNotably, Buterin underscored the rise in prominence of rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and second-generation privacy solutions, aligning with certain values tied to cypherpunk principles, denoting individuals who prioritize encryption for network privacy, especially against government entities.\n\nThe implementation and evolution of the outlined components have generated significant interest and anticipation within the ETH community. These innovative developments are expected to transform the platform, and stakeholders eagerly anticipate their practical implementation."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is scheduled to happen in less than four months from now. As with other halvings, analysts have forecasted that it could act as a catalyst for a bullish market.\n\nWith a bull market expected in 2024, analysts expect several top altcoins to experience major price increases. Among the tokens with the most potential are Pullix (PLX), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Ethereum (ETH). Which of them has the potential for a 10x price surge?\n\nCan Pullix (PLX) Surge By 10x in 2024?\n\nWith the Bitcoin halving acting as a catalyst, Pullix (PLX) has emerged as one of the top altcoins to watch. The project has gained massive attention due to its resolve to revolutionize the crypto exchange space. Pullix is a unique exchange that blends the characteristics of centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) platforms.\n\nBeing a hybrid platform, Pullix was constructed to provide more security and transaction efficiency, greater decentralization, cheaper fees, and access to numerous markets. Another area where Pullix beats other exchanges is in the support for assets. On the exchange, users can trade assets from the stocks, ETF, and commodities markets.\n\nIn addition, Pullix has added artificial intelligence support. Thus equipped, Pullix users can quickly analyze market patterns and find profitable trade opportunities as well\u2013and they don\u2019t even need to leave the platform. These features have made Pullix one of the top DeFi projects for 2024.\n\nIt has already helped Pullix attract an increasing number of users and investors, as well. Over the last few weeks alone, Pullix has taken in more than $ 2 million\u2013with its PLX token rising up to $0.07. This growth has led analysts to predict it will rally by as much as 25x, making this one of the top altcoins worth watching.\n\nCan Dogecoin (DOGE) Surge By 10x in 2024?\n\nIn past bull markets, Dogecoin (DOGE) skyrocketed. It rose over 10x last year alone. But it has failed to reproduce the same bullish impetus this year. So far this year, the price of DOGE has skyrocketed 30 %, while other parts of the crypto market have had increases as high as 150 %.\n\nIn 2024, the price of Dogecoin could rise by a factor of 10 and hit $ 1 for the first time since its launch. Even if a 10x price surge still looks out of reach, many analysts predict that Dogecoin will be one of the top altcoins in 2024.\n\nOne big reason many analysts think otherwise is the unlimited supply of DOGE. A 10X upsurge will bring DOGE to a market cap in excess of $130 billion, overtaking Tether as the third-largest crypto.\n\nCan Ethereum (ETH) Surge By 10x in 2024?\n\nEthereum (ETH) remains a heavyweight in the cryptosphere. The price of ETH is expected to skyrocket in 2024 as the leading altcoin and first smart contract platform. A number of analysts have made extremely optimistic forecasts about ETH.\n\nFieryTrading has forecast that by the end of 2024, Ethereum\u2019s price will reach above $5,000. Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has put a target in place of $3,400-$3,800 by the first quarter of \u201924. JPMorgan\u2019s Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou is confident that Ethereum will hit the dizzying heights of $8,000 by 2026.\n\nThese are all still very bullish forecasts, but they aren\u2019t 10x increases in the price of Ethereum. If Ethereum rises 10x, its price would have to hit $22,300 by December 24. This is because the top DeFi projects on Ethereum won\u2019t be able to spark this much increase by 2024.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving event has been forecasted to set the stage for a bullish 2024. While Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Pullix are the top altcoins to watch, PLX stands out as the clear favorite. With a revolutionary platform and smaller market cap, PLX could yield more than 10x by 2024.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\n*This article was paid.

        "title": "Exploring Kevin Sekniqi's 2024 Roadmap for Avalanche's Evolution - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Kevin Sekniqi is a notable figure in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry, recognized for his contributions as a co-founder and key executive at Ava Labs. Ava Labs is the company behind Avalanche, a blockchain platform known for its high throughput, low latency, and scalability, making it a popular choice for decentralized applications (dApps) and custom blockchain networks.\n\nKevin Sekniqi\u2019s role at Ava Labs involves leading various aspects of the company\u2019s strategy and operations, focusing on the development and growth of the Avalanche ecosystem. His work includes overseeing technological advancements, fostering partnerships, and promoting the adoption of Avalanche among developers and businesses.\n\nSekniqi, along with other co-founders of Ava Labs, including Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, a well-known computer scientist and professor at Cornell University, has been instrumental in driving innovation in the blockchain space. Their work at Ava Labs is particularly significant in addressing some of the common challenges faced by blockchain networks, such as scalability, speed, and interoperability.\n\nIn response to Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin\u2019s recent publication of a technical roadmap diagram for Ethereum for 2024, Kevin Sekniqi of Ava Labs shared his personal wishlist for Avalanche\u2019s development in the coming year. This wishlist, while reflective of Sekniqi\u2019s personal aspirations, aligns with many developments already slated for Avalanche in 2024.\n\nHere\u2019s a detailed breakdown of Sekniqi\u2019s wishlist\n\nBase Layer Consensus Improvements\n\nSekniqi envisions significant enhancements in Avalanche\u2019s base layer consensus. The goal is to reduce the time to finality to under 250 milliseconds, with an \u201coptimistic fast finality\u201d mode achievable in just one or two rounds. This improvement, deeply integrated with all APIs, aims to provide nearly instantaneous experiences for users, enhancing wallet and frontend interactions.\n\nConsensus Capacity Upgrades\n\nProposed changes to the c-chain involve a swap to a non-primary subnet, accompanied by increased hardware requirements. Despite Avalanche\u2019s lightweight nature, boosting storage and network bandwidth requirements could significantly enhance its capacity.\n\nDeep Code Refactoring\n\nA major overhaul in the codebase is planned, focusing on reducing technical debt. This involves removing all Geth code, except for the basic state transition logic, to reduce dependency on the Geth codebase. Such refactoring will simplify and secure code upgrades, accelerating VM upgrades.\n\nDatabase Upgrades\n\nPost-refactoring, Sekniqi suggests introducing FirewoodDB, a linear-access database optimized for blockchain data storage. This upgrade is expected to drastically improve the read-write efficiency of the EVM (and other VMs), addressing the current issue where validators spend a majority of their processing time accessing state data on disk.\n\nSubnet Upgrades\n\nThe wishlist includes enabling c-chain-native elastic subnet staking. Currently, launching a permissionless, elastic chain is limited to tokens minted on the x/p-chains. Expanding this capability to the c-chain, where most active tokens currently reside, could be a significant development.\n\nAWM and Teleporter\n\nSekniqi aims to bring AWM (Avalanche Wallet Messaging) and Teleporter (the messaging/bridging and contract interfaces) to production level. The objective is to achieve a time-to-finality for an AWM message between two subnets under one second, potentially making Avalanche the fastest network for chain-to-chain state transitions.\n\nHyperSDK Development\n\nHyperSDK, already facilitating easy subnet launches, is set for further enhancements. The goal is to evolve HyperSDK into a comprehensive toolkit that allows for easy modifications and upgrades to various chain components, fostering rapid experimentation.\n\nPush for New VMs\n\nFinally, Sekniqi expresses a desire to see HyperVM, Avalanche\u2019s native VM, gain traction. He believes that HyperVM can enable optimizations beyond the capabilities of the current c-chain, potentially revolutionizing Avalanche\u2019s performance and capabilities.\n\nI don't have a visual diagram for the Avalanche tech roadmap, but here's an abridged summary of what I'd personally love to see, written in human-readable format. Note: this is my personal wish-list, but a lot of these are already slated for 2024.\n\n\n\n1.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Unveils Ambitious 2024 Ethereum Roadmap - FXDailyReport.com",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed an Ethereum roadmap for ecosystem development in 2024. Analysts expect Ethereum to reach $5,300. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has become a complete ecosystem that supports decentralized apps and digital currencies.\n\nPal Targets $5,300 Using Liquidity Indicator\n\nReal Vision co-founder and CEO Raoul Pal has also boosted Ethereum optimism. Pal anticipates Ethereum\u2019s value to rise significantly in the first half of 2024 using the liquidity indicator, a measure experts use to predict price changes. Pal\u2019s confidence matches the overall positive outlook for Ethereum, but such estimates are speculative.\n\nEthereum is anticipated to perform exceptionally well in the first half of 2024. Using the liquidity indicator, aim for $5,300. Ethereum may hit its peak in the first half of 2024, Pal said.\n\nPal noted that ETFs may affect Ethereum\u2019s performance. He thinks a Bitcoin ETF might lead to an Ethereum ETF, reviving Ethereum.\n\nThe revised Vitalik Buterin approach for 2024 matches Pal\u2019s bullish predictions. The co-founder highlighted many major improvements, including the addition of Single Slot Finality (SSF) to the post-Merge Proof-of-Stake (PoS) update. The SSF can fix Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) architecture, speeding up and improving transactional security.\n\nTrending Now: SlowMist Exposes Unauthorized Approvals Leading to Crypto Thefts\n\nButerin stressed that SSF (Stateless Ethereum) is the easiest way to fix numerous Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) design flaws. EIP-4844 and rollup advancements have also helped engineers make breakthroughs in other sectors like the Surge. These enhancements will let Ethereum handle higher workloads and run more effectively, which are essential to its success.\n\nButerin Tackles Ethereum\u2019s PoS Challenges with Scourge Redesign\n\nButerin\u2019s approach addresses PoS economic centralization difficulties with the revised Scourge. The integrity and decentralization of the Ethereum network are the main goals of this overhaul, which addresses issues like Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) and stake pooling.\n\nHowever, progress has been difficult. Current designs\u2019 cryptographic flaws make Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) challenging for developers. Despite these challenges, the development team persists in studying and improving these services, demonstrating a strong dedication to the project\u2019s long-term viability.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s broad strategy and analysts like Raoul Pal\u2019s optimism support Ethereum\u2019s path. Ethereum\u2019s focused efforts to overcome technological difficulties and make improvements show a commitment to its development and originality, bolstering its position in the developing cryptocurrency market."

        "title": "What Will Happen to Ethereum After Proto-Danksharding, Planned for 2024? - Crypto Economy",
        "content": "As Ethereum continues to evolve, a key upgrade on the horizon is Proto-Danksharding. This improvement, also known as EIP-4844, is set to revolutionize Ethereum\u2019s scalability and efficiency. Proto-Danksharding is an intermediate phase towards complete Danksharding. It introduces \u201cblob-carrying transactions\u201d, a new type of transaction that allows for more cost-effective data handling.\n\nThese blobs provide temporary storage for Layer 2 rollups, crucial for reducing operational costs. The introduction of Proto-Danksharding will significantly increase Ethereum\u2019s transaction capacity while simultaneously reducing transaction costs. As the need for block space grows, transaction costs are becoming economically unsustainable for basic actions.\n\nProto-Danksharding aims to address this by decreasing gas prices and transaction fees. The implementation of Proto-Danksharding will also bring about a new fee mechanism for blob-data. This two-dimensional nature means that block builders will need to simultaneously avoid hitting two different limits (gas limit and data limit) when accepting transactions.\n\nMoreover, Proto-Danksharding is expected to pave the way for full Danksharding. Full Danksharding is essentially a new kind of data availability layer. It is expected to result in a significant increase in block space and significantly reduce transaction costs, up to 10x less than current gas fees.\n\nEthereum\u2019s End Users, the Primary Beneficiaries of EIP-4844\n\nThe enhancements suggested in EIP-4844 and the implementation of Proto-danksharding are primarily designed to benefit end users. The key outcome of these improvements is a substantial decrease in transaction expenses.\n\nLower fees also have the added advantage of enabling arbitrageurs to rectify minor price differences, which in turn draws more users to DEXs by making them more liquid and cost-effective to run. In the long run, enhancing the scalability of the Ethereum network encourages broader adoption, which is advantageous to all members of the ecosystem.\n\nA part of the crypto community remains cautious regarding the impact of proto-danksharding on the price of ETH. A year after The Merge upgrade, Ethereum continue to trade at around the same price it did before the change took place. Others, however, are a bit more optimistic and claim the proto-danksharding upgrade will have an increasing impact on the price of ETH, going so far as to predict ETH reaching $4000.\n\nIn conclusion, the introduction of Proto-Danksharding is a game-changer for Ethereum. It promises to enhance scalability, reduce transaction costs, and prepare Ethereum for future advancements. As we look forward to its implementation next year, it\u2019s clear that this upgrade will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Ethereum."

        "content": "In a recent development, Whale Alert, the renowned tracker of significant cryptocurrency movements, has reported substantial transactions involving Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) today. On December 30, a staggering 1,335 BTC was shifted from Coinbase to an undisclosed wallet, indicating a strategic move by a major player in the market. Simultaneously, a contrasting transaction saw 3,144 BTC sent to Coinbase, signaling opposing intentions within the whale community\u2014one opting to hold and the other contemplating a sell-off.\n\nAround $33.50 million worth of Ethereum was transferred to Coinbase, with an additional 9,991 ETH added within a few hours. This influx of ETH coincided with its recent surge in value, which pushed it beyond $2,400. Despite this rise, the altcoin faced difficulty breaking free from the $2,292 to $2,379 range, leading to speculation of a bullish trend until December 27th, followed by a consolidation phase.\n\nUnveiling Crypto Whales\u2019 Impact\n\nThe technical analysis highlighted a complex scenario for ETH. According to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), there was a clear indication of diminishing bullish momentum, suggesting a possible decline below the $2,300 mark if the prevailing trend continued. However, an interesting bullish divergence materialized within this context: while the RSI consistently formed higher lows, ETH\u2019s price charted lower highs. This discrepancy hinted at an imminent reversal, potentially paving the way for a rally pushing ETH towards the $2,500 mark.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s recent price action contradicted the market\u2019s optimism surrounding a potential ETF approval, with its value slipping below $42,000. The 4-hour chart revealed a bearish momentum signaled by the MACD, indicating a potential descent towards $40,000. However, a positive accumulation spike could trigger a bullish breakout targeting $45,000.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nIn the midst of these market fluctuations, the Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) indicator shed light on the stagnant accumulation of BTC in recent days. This prolonged lack of significant accumulation signals a potential downward trajectory for BTC if this trend persists, suggesting a probable downtrend in the near future.\n\nShort-term projections indicate minor price adjustments for both ETH and BTC. Nonetheless, this doesn\u2019t undermine the bullish prospects in the near term. Despite looming volatility, the market appears primed for potential reversals and upward movements in the forthcoming days, showcasing a resilient stance toward possible market shifts."
