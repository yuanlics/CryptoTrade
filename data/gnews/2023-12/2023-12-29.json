The growth of Ethereum staking service Lido has raised concerns around economic centralization in Ethereum since the blockchain's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus.\n\nAside from other small changes, the core priorities of the Ethereum ecosystem remain the same from last year's outline. Vitalik declined to estimate a timeline for the changes to the ecosystem, though the changes are ordered roughly according to priority."

        "title": "What Are Native Tokens? - Cryptocurrency - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Are Native Tokens?\n\nThe term \"native token\" is used to refer to a token that is created on a specific blockchain. In the past, the term was used to refer to the original token made for a blockchain that had an internal use. However, it has since morphed to include any tokens that are made on that blockchain.\n\nA few examples of native tokens are bitcoin, ether, and the stablecoin USDC, created by Centre, a partnership between Coinbase and Circle. USDC is native to several blockchains or supporting layers.\n\nKey Takeaways Native tokens are the tokens on a blockchain created originally for that blockchain.\n\nNative tokens can also be additional tokens created on a blockchain.\n\n\n\nExamples of native tokens include ether (ETH), bitcoin (BTC), stellar (XLM), and solana (SOL).\n\nNon-native tokens are not created on a specific blockchain but can be used on it.\n\nUnderstanding Native Tokens\n\nWhen a blockchain is developed, it is generally created to address a specific issue. For instance, the Bitcoin blockchain and its native token, bitcoin, were created to be a payment system, using a reward mechanism as an incentive for securing the blockchain. Ethereum was designed to be a system on which other applications could be designed, using ether as the reward for work done for the blockchain. At the time, and for several years, tokens like these were considered native tokens.\n\nBut it's important to understand that with cryptocurrency, definitions and concepts change over time because it is still in its infancy. As of December 2023, a native token is one that is created and stored on a particular blockchain. Its purpose or utility doesn't matter as long as it was minted on that blockchain. A token that wasn't minted on a specific blockchain is not native to that blockchain. These are usually called non-native tokens.\n\nNative Tokens and Forks\n\nThe token of a forked blockchain is also a native token because forking projects generally create a new blockchain and token from the old one. A fork is a change in a blockchain that some users accept but not others. The ones that accept the change run the new blockchain, and the ones that don't accept it run the version it was forked from.\n\nThe blockchain and token might be replicas of the old chain, but they will be named something different, making the token on that chain a native token because it was minted on the forked blockchain.\n\nExamples of Native Tokens\n\nNotable examples of native tokens are bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano\u2019s native token (ADA), and USDC.\n\nUSDC is a stablecoin originally created by Coinbase and Circle on the Ethereum blockchain. It is pegged to the dollar with a reserve equal to the amount of circulating USDC (held by BlackRock). By the old definition, it was not a native token because it had no internal use on the blockchain. However, the stablecoin is now minted (issued or created) and backed by Circle on many other blockchains, making it one cryptocurrency native to many chains.\n\nAs of Dec. 28, 2023, USDC was native to Algorand, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Flow, Hedera, NEAR, Noble, OP Mainnet, Polkadot, Polygon PoS, Solana, Stellar, and TRON.\n\nWrapped bitcoin (WBTC) is a bitcoin that has been tokenized (given a token) on the Ethereum blockchain via a smart contract. The bitcoin is sent to a custodial address controlled by a smart contract, and a WBTC is created on the Ethereum blockchain that represents a 1:1 bitcoin value.\n\nWBTC can then be used in Ethereum decentralized applications. Once someone wants to convert it back to bitcoin (BTC), it is sent to an address on the Ethereum network that burns the WBTC, and the smart contract transfers the bitcoin to the owner. This is the same process USDC uses to transfer value\u2014it uses smart contracts to burn the USDC on the Ethereum blockchain and mint a token on the target one. If USDC is native to targeted blockchains, then WBTC is native to Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Is a Coin vs. a Native Token? Some use the term \"coin\" to refer to a cryptocurrency. A native token is a token created on the blockchain it is used and stored on.\n\nIs Ethereum a Native Token? Ethereum's token ether (ETH) is a native token because it was created for the ecosystem and used in it.\n\nIs ADA a Native Token? Yes. ADA is the original token for the Solana blockchain, which was one of the first blockchains to use proof-of-stake.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNative tokens are created and stored on a specific blockchain or its supporting layers. This definition differs from past definitions because the industry is still in its infancy and changing.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "The Dec. 28 blog post reiterated the core values of Ethereum, harking back to its early days when it was more \u201ccypherpunk.\u201d\n\nThe early vision of Bitcoin and Ethereum was deeply idealistic, aiming to build a more open, decentralized, and censorship-resistant internet and economy.\n\nHowever, Buterin lamented that over time, this vision faded as transaction fees rose, making applications focused on payments and speculation more dominant. The culture shifted toward \u201cdegen gamblers,\u201d he added.\n\nCypherpunk is a movement advocating the use of technology to promote privacy and social change while protecting against state or corporate oppression.\n\nEthereum Back to its Roots\n\nNevertheless, there have been signs of a culture revival in 2023 due to rollups reducing fees, advances in privacy technology like zk-proofs, and a desire to move beyond over-financialization, he said.\n\nEthereum could be a testbed for open and decentralized security innovations like social recovery wallets, prediction markets, and quadratic voting, which could later influence the broader internet.\n\nMoreover, the ideal future Web3 tech stack contains decentralized equivalents to DNS, email, payments, identities, publishing, and governance that interoperate while avoiding central points of control, said Buterin.\n\nHe concluded that many come to crypto to get rich but become decentralization converts when they realize what the technology is capable of.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of people whose first introduction to the crypto space is the desire to get rich, but who then get acquainted with the ecosystem and become avid believers in the quest to build a more open and decentralized world.\u201d\n\nButerin has been busy blogging lately. Earlier this week, he proposed measures to reduce the load on the Ethereum blockchain by reducing the number of cryptographic signatures that validators need to produce.\n\nIn May, he warned of the dangers of stretching Ethereum\u2019s consensus past its core functions of validating blocks and securing the network.\n\nETH Price Doubles in 2023\n\nEthereum prices have perked up this week, reaching a 2023 high of $2,430 on Dec. 28. The asset has largely trailed Bitcoin and competing blockchain tokens such as Solana and Avalanche in recent months.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is the world\u2019s second-largest crypto asset and the industry standard for smart contracts. Moreover, it has doubled in price since the beginning of the year when it was trading at just $1,200.\n\nFinally, ETH prices could surge to $15,000 in the next bull market, according to analysts who have measured gains from previous cycles and projected them forward."

Source: Google Trends\n\nAccording to Google Trends data, the search term Solana is set to get a score of 100 in terms of search interest from Dec. 24 to Dec. 30. Google Trends notes that a value of 100 means \u201cpeak popularity for the term.\u201d\n\nThe data also showed that Solana attracted more search interest than Ethereum in countries such as Spain and the Philippines. However, interest in Ethereum still dominated in Indonesia, Taiwan, Morocco and others.\n\nSolana search interest breakdown by region. Source: Google Trends\n\nMeanwhile, the data also showed that users who searched Solana have shown interest in search terms like \u201cbonk\u201d and \u201ctensor.\u201d Bonk is a dog-themed memecoin that flipped Pepecoin (PEPE) in market capitalization on Dec. 8, following a 370% monthly gain. On the other hand, Tensor is a Solana-based nonfungible token marketplace that created the NFT collection Tensorians, which showed massive gains in the last 30 days.\n\nRelated: Solana is up 95% in December \u2014 But why are AVAX, INJ, NEAR surging even higher?\n\nInterest in the proof-of-stake blockchain platform may have also been fueled by the recent uptick in the price of Solana\u2019s (SOL) token. On Dec. 20, SOL\u2019s market cap passed Ripple\u2019s XRP (XRP) as the token\u2019s price saw a 13.8% increase, topping $82 for the first time since May 2022 and overtaking XRP.\n\nOn Dec. 22, SOL flipped BNB (BNB), taking the spot for the fourth-largest crypto token by market capitalization. However, BNB reclaimed its spot on Dec. 29 as the SOL token returned to pre-Christmas prices.\n\nMagazine: 10 best long reads about crypto in 2023"

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin has voiced a new vision for the Ethereum platform that seeks to address its most pressing challenges and leverage emerging technologies to reinvent Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure. Central to this vision is a renewed focus on scalability and privacy, fueled by the development of layer-2 solutions and novel privacy technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin acknowledges probably the biggest issue on the network right now \u2013 high fees. This barrier has not only hindered widespread adoption but also skewed the network toward financial applications, as only users with significant resources can afford to transact during peak times. The proposed solution to this predicament lies in the advancement of rollups. Rollups perform transaction execution outside the main Ethereum chain (layer 1) but post transaction data to layer 1, thereby enhancing the network\u2019s capacity while retaining its security.\n\nThe advent of rollups, particularly optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups, has been a primary way of reducing fees on the network. These rollups promise to execute a large number of transactions at a fraction of the cost currently required on the main chain, potentially lowering the entry barrier for new users and diverse applications.\n\nAccount abstraction is another key component of Buterin's vision. It represents a shift in how user accounts and transactions are managed, offering a more flexible and user-friendly model that could open up new possibilities for application developers.\n\nLight clients, which have been on the backburner for some time, are now closer to fruition. Their role is crucial for enabling users to interact with the Ethereum network without running full nodes, thereby lowering the technical barriers to entry and participation.\n\nThe most groundbreaking development highlighted by Buterin is the practical application of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Once considered a distant future technology, ZKPs are now increasingly developer-friendly and on the verge of consumer application. This technology could revolutionize privacy and scalability on Ethereum by allowing users to validate transactions without revealing underlying information."

        "title": "Vitalik wants Ethereum to be more 'Cypherpunk' hailing the social layer as its core USP - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared his insights on the evolving landscape of the crypto ecosystem on Dec. 29, mainly focusing on Ethereum\u2019s role in shaping a more open and decentralized internet in a blog post entitled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again.\u201d\n\nSince its inception, Ethereum has journeyed beyond being a mere extension of Bitcoin with smart contracts. Buterin recalls early memories of using Bitcoin in Berlin\u2019s Bitcoin Kiez and at PorcFest, a libertarian gathering, highlighting the intertwined nature of technological and social aspects in the crypto world. These experiences stress the broader vision of crypto: fostering a free, open society where technology, social, and economic elements harmoniously interact.\n\nThe initial concept of \u201cweb3,\u201d as coined by Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Gavin Wood, envisioned Ethereum as a fundamental component of a more open internet stack. This vision aimed to overcome the limitations of the free, open-source software movement of the 1980s and \u201990s, which did not account for modern internet applications\u2019 collaborative and centralized nature. Ethereum, along with technologies like peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage, was seen as a decentralized, shared hard drive crucial for extending the spirit of open source into today\u2019s interconnected world. For Buterin, the chart below outlines the core benefits of decentralized technologies.\n\nHowever, Buterin notes a shift in focus since around 2017, with a diminished emphasis on consumer crypto payments and non-financial applications. This shift is partly attributed to rising transaction fees on the Ethereum network, which have priced out more minor, non-financial uses in favor of financial applications dominated by speculative activities. According to Buterin, this change has led to a misalignment with the original vision of Ethereum and the broader crypto space.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, Buterin highlights several positive developments in Ethereum\u2019s technology that could steer the platform back toward its foundational principles. These include advancements in rollups, second-generation privacy solutions, account abstraction, light clients, and zero-knowledge proofs. These technologies address the challenge of scalability and embody the values of decentralization, censorship resistance, and open participation.\n\nAs part of a broader technological vision, Buterin states, Ethereum continues developing its original components and \u201csister technologies\u201d such as decentralized messaging and decentralized storage. Introducing zero-knowledge proofs adds a new dimension, enabling privacy and authentication simultaneously. For instance, Buterin notes how Zupass, a zero-knowledge-proof-based system, successfully implemented anonymous voting, demonstrating the potential of Ethereum-based technologies in achieving privacy without sacrificing security.\n\n\u201cWe can start to see the contours of what an Ethereum-y cypherpunk world would look like, at least on a pure technical level. We can be holding our assets in ETH and ERC20 tokens, as well as all kinds of NFTs, and use privacy systems based on stealth addresses and Privacy Pools technology to preserve our privacy while at the same time locking out known bad actors\u2019 ability to benefit from the same anonymity set.\u201d\n\nButerin also emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s role in developing a decentralized tech protocol stack, competing with traditional centralized systems. This stack includes banking, social media, and identity verification alternatives, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s commitment to building tools that interoperate with a broader ecosystem rather than creating isolated empires.\n\nThe social layer of Ethereum is equally crucial, according to Buterin. He acknowledges the need for a balance between incentive-driven and community-oriented approaches. Large-scale public goods funding and cooperative efforts within the Ethereum ecosystem are steps toward this balance, yet there is much room for growth and improvement.\n\n\u201cThere is a unqiue mix of valuing a warm and cohesive community, but at the same time remembering that what feels \u201cwarm and cohesive\u201d from the inside can easily feel \u201coppressive and exclusive\u201d from the outside, and valuing hard norms of neutrality, open source and censorship resistance as a way of guarding against the risks of going too far in being community-driven.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Buterin envisions Ethereum as a platform that excels technically and economically and fosters a robust and value-driven community. Buterin closes his post by stating,\n\n\u201cIf this mix can be made to work well, it will in turn be in the best possible position to realize its vision on the economic and technical level.\u201d\n\nButerin believes integrating technical innovation with social and ethical principles could potentially lead Ethereum to realize its original vision of a decentralized, open, and equitable digital world."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposes reducing the number of signatures for validators in the PoS system to simplify the system, address technical issues, and enhance network security.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder, recently proposed a significant change to the Ethereum blockchain's proof-of-stake (PoS) system. The core of his proposal is to reduce the number of signatures that validators must process. Currently, Ethereum's PoS mechanism involves around 895,000 validators processing approximately 28,000 signatures per slot, which results in a heavy load on the network\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe Need for Change: Balancing Decentralization and Efficiency\n\nThis high number of validators and the associated signature load come with major technical downsides. It limits quantum resistance, complicates forking, and challenges scaling signatures through zero-knowledge proofs (SNARKs). Moreover, the high minimum of 32 ETH for becoming a validator remains prohibitive for many, limiting widespread participation\u200b\u200b.\n\nButerin suggests that reducing the signature requirement to about 8,192 per slot, down from the current 28,000, would offer several benefits. It would simplify the consensus mechanism, make the blockchain more quantum-resistant, and maintain a high total of slashable ETH (1-2 million ETH), a mechanism to enforce good behavior among validators\u200b\u200b.\n\nExploring Alternative Approaches: Decentralized Staking Pools and More\n\nButerin outlined three potential approaches for this change:\n\nDecentralized Staking Pools: This method involves increasing the minimum ether required for staking, encouraging smaller validators to form pools. This shift would reduce the number of individual validators\u200b\u200b. Dual-Layer Staking System: A 'heavy' layer would require a higher ETH stake (4,096 ETH) for participation in finalization processes, while a 'light' layer would have no minimum requirement, creating a balance between security and accessibility\u200b\u200b. Rotating Validator Set: This approach would involve a rotating set of 4,096 validators for each slot, adjusting the set during each slot to ensure network safety\u200b\u200b.\n\nAddressing Security Concerns\n\nButerin also pointed out the limitations of the committee-based security model used in other blockchains. This model, which randomly selects a group of validators for each slot, lacks accountability in the event of a 51% attack. Ethereum's current system, which imposes severe penalties for such attacks, is effective but might be excessively punitive. A balanced solution maintaining high slashable Ethereum while making concessions on validator accountability is needed\u200b\u200b.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "After a strong rally, Ethereum (ETH) gains have come to a halt as the crypto extended losses on Friday, December 29, 2023. The bullish run on Thursday propelled the Ethereum price over the $2,445 mark, which was a significant milestone. However, the surge was short-lived as the crypto dropped to about $2,350 at press time.\n\nThe decline could have been initiated due to massive whale transfers as they aim to lock in profits from the recent price rally. In the last 24 hours, whales dumped more than $136 million worth of ETH into various crypto exchanges.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Whale Transfers Exceed $136 million\n\nAccording to recent posts by Whale Alert on X, three major Ethereum whale transactions were recorded after the recent price surge. A total of $136.18 million worth of ETH was dumped by whales. The latest transaction, recorded about four hours ago, involves a shift of 10,000 ETH from an unknown wallet to Gate.io. The transfer amounted to $23.26 million.\n\nWhilst, in another notable transaction, 14,612 ETH worth $34.11 million were dumped to Coinbase via an undisclosed wallet. Furthermore, the largest dump was recorded about 15 hours ago when 33,400 ETH was dumped. This whale transaction, worth $78.81 million, was directed toward Binance from an unidentified wallet.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price: Analyst Predicts 22% Surge In Ethereum (ETH) Price Sparking Market Optimism\n\nEthereum Price Today\n\nThe ETH price tumbled 1.19% as it traded at $2,353.05 at press time on Friday. This comes after it recorded a 30-day high of $2,445.02 on Thursday, December 28. Though the price has been declining currently, the crypto has managed to gain over 3% in the last seven days owing to the recent bullish run.\n\nMoreover, the second largest crypto also registered an impressive 1-month gain of over 14%. According to TradingView analytics, the current price of ETH is trading way higher than the 50-day EMA of 2156.90, indicating a bullish sentiment despite the recent pullback. Whilst, the RSI value stands neutral at 59.5.\n\nAs of writing, the ETH market cap had declined by 1.18% to $282.79 billion. In addition, the 24-hour trade volume plunged significantly. The trade volume dropped by 22.32% to $13.60 billion.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum (ETH) Price Jumps 9% Above $2,400, Beginning of 2024 Bull Run?"

Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Solana and Ethereum prices continue to rise while the crypto markets maintain a choppy trend and hover within a narrow range\n\nThe SOL price is gaining more attention compared to the top two cryptos, which may turn against itself soon\n\nThe crypto markets are displaying mixed reactions as a couple of crypto trends continue to remain neutral. Solana rebounded from the lower support, and Ethereum continues to maintain a bullish streak. While the tokens have been displaying some strength, the other cryptos maintain a neutral trend.\n\nSOL and ETH prices have been attracting significant gains in the past few days, despite the bearishness that has managed to hinder the progress of the rally. The recent 1000% jump in SOL price has attracted a massive investor base that has raised volume and volatility to a large extent. Besides, the token also received huge attention as Google searches for Solana overtook Ethereum for the first time in history.\n\nThe rise in interest flashes bullish signals for crypto as it displaces XRP and is constantly challenging BNB in the top 10 market rankings. However, the current market trend suggests the bulls may have been subdued by the whales to some extent. Moreover, massive transactions have created ripples across the platform. According to an analytical platform, an investor deposited 303,756 SOL on Binance, intending to extract profits.\n\nThis may be the reason that the SOL price faced a notable pullback from the yearly highs above $126. Interestingly, the profits extracted from the rally appear to be flowing back to the top 2 tokens, as the liquidity rotation could be happening towards ETH. Therefore, this may be the reason the SOL price is consolidating.\n\nHence, Michael van de Poppe, a well-known crypto analyst, believes the trend may remain in favour of bears, and $70 to $80 could be a good entry for long-term entries."

        "title": "Forget XRP, This Unstoppable Crypto Is Now on Pace to Topple Ethereum and Become the Next Trillion-Dollar Asset - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Make no mistake about it, Solana (SOL -1.46%) is ending the year with a bang. Up more than 900% in 2023, Solana recently passed XRP (XRP 4.62%) to become the fifth-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. Solana now has a $43 billion market cap, and appears to be growing much faster than anyone could have predicted a year ago.\n\nSo just how much higher can Solana go? There's now a case to be made that Solana is on pace to pass Ethereum (ETH 1.60%) to become the second-most valuable cryptocurrency, trailing only Bitcoin (BTC 2.37%). That would represent a huge paradigm shift in the crypto world, given that Ethereum has historically played the role of \"digital silver\" to Bitcoin's \"digital gold.\" Yet there are already signs that this paradigm shift is underway. Let's take a closer look.\n\nNFT evidence\n\nThe first evidence of this potential paradigm shift comes from the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), an area where Ethereum has traditionally dominated. The two most famous NFT collections -- the Bored Ape Yacht Club and the CryptoPunks -- are found on the Ethereum blockchain. Historically, they have been the most popular collections for NFT trading and have been reliable benchmarks for how the overall NFT market is performing.\n\nYet they are no longer the market leaders. The last time I checked, a frog-themed NFT collection for the Solana blockchain had passed the Bored Ape Yacht Club in terms of 24-hour sales volume. And other Solana NFT collections are performing well over longer seven-day and 30-day windows. In fact, according to CryptoSlam data, Solana is nearly tied with Ethereum in terms of 30-day NFT sales volume.\n\nDeFi evidence\n\nMuch the same story is true in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), where Solana appears to be narrowing the gap. This is also an area where Ethereum has historically dominated. But at the end of December, Solana passed Ethereum in terms of DeFi for the first time ever.\n\nOver both a seven-day and 24-hour period, decentralized exchanges on the Solana blockchain saw more trading volume than decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain. This is particularly striking, given that Solana has never made DeFi a core priority. Granted, much of this volume appears to be coming from the buying and selling of Solana meme coins, but it's still interesting to note.\n\nInstitutional buy-in\n\nMoreover, institutional investors appear to be lining up behind Solana as well. According to CoinShares, which tracks institutional money flows out of various cryptos, the pattern throughout 2023 has been the influx of new money into Solana. At the same time, these large institutional investors appear to be scaling back their exposure to Ethereum.\n\nAs a signal of this institutional buy-in, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest recently appeared on CNBC talking up the merits of Solana vis-a-vis Ethereum. Simply stated, Solana is a faster, more cost-effective version of Ethereum, and so it only makes sense that it should be gaining market share in key areas. Shouldn't the best technology win? If that's the case, then the valuation of Solana could soar.\n\nMind the gap\n\nAlthough Solana does appears to be gaining ground on Ethereum, a huge chasm in market cap still separates them. While Solana has a market cap of $43 billion, Ethereum has a market cap of more than $280 billion. For Solana to pass Ethereum in market cap, something extraordinary needs to happen, beyond just the capture of a few points of market share in the world of NFTs or DeFi.\n\nAnd investment firm VanEck seems to have the answer. That \"something extraordinary\" is the launch of a killer app for the Solana blockchain that is capable of onboarding 100 million users. That number might sound preposterous, but keep in mind it only took ChatGPT two months to acquire that many users this year.\n\nIf Solana finds that killer app, says VanEck, its future price could skyrocket by more than 10,000%. Assuming that Solana continues to gain share at the expense of Ethereum in key market niches, VanEck projects that the price of Solana could approach $3,200 by 2030 compared with today's price of about $100.\n\nA $1 trillion valuation for Solana?\n\nIf you multiply that price of $3,200 by Solana's current circulating coin supply of about 429 million, that gives you a figure of $1.4 trillion as a projected market cap. So a valuation of more than $1 trillion is certainly within grasp for Solana. That's the ultimate bull case scenario, of course, but it's still interesting to consider.\n\nIf you are thinking about investing in Solana, keep a close eye on metrics that show that Solana is indeed narrowing the gap with Ethereum. Tracking the sales numbers of digital frogs or digital apes might sound silly, but data like this could signal whether a real paradigm shift is underway. Several years from now, analysts might be talking about Solana as the next trillion-dollar asset."

If the ETH price goes below a certain level, the whale's collateral will be insufficient to cover their debt, and MakerDAO will automatically liquidate the ETH to reclaim the DAI.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, if the price of ETH drops to $2,257, the said large ETH holder might be in danger of liquidation. This is because the healthy ratio on MakerDAO is presently as low as 1.03.\n\nThe Ethereum price is nearing this threshold, having fallen 3.56% in the last 24 hours to trade at $2,280, according to CoinMarketCap data. Since reaching a high of $2,448 on Dec. 28, the price of Ethereum has steadily dropped.\n\nIf today closes in red, ETH might be set to mark its third consecutive day of losses. The ETH price fell to intraday lows of $2,255 on Dec. 29, but at present, it has held up above the lows of $2,267 marked in today's trading session.\n\nWherever ETH price trends, the whale's fate is now related to the performance of ETH and the crypto market as a whole, which is currently declining as investors book profits through the end of 2023."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSolana (SOL) has seen a significant increase in its value throughout 2023, with notable growth, especially in mid-December.\n\nGoogle search interest in Solana has recently exceeded that for Ethereum, with particular popularity in countries like Spain and the Philippines.\n\nAlong with its rise in search popularity, Solana has also seen a surge in trading volume and has outperformed Ethereum in certain other metrics.\n\nSolana Takes the Lead\n\nSolana\u2019s price has exploded by 1,000% since January 1, hovering around $107 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data) as of the moment. The token saw its value gradually increasing throughout the year, with the most rapid pace occurring in mid-December.\n\nThis could be one reason why Solana searches on Google have surpassed those for Ethereum since then. The former currently has an index of 56, while its rival is with 51. Google searches are usually a trailing indicator, which tends to increase after the price goes up.\n\nSolana has gained the most popularity in Spain and the Philippines. In contrast, the residents of Brazil, Poland, and Finland remain much more interested in Ethereum.\n\nGoogle\u2019s data shows that people from the countries searching for Solana have also shown significant interest in Bonk Inu (BONK) \u2013 a memecoin built on the network. The dog-themed crypto asset made the headlines earlier this month when its price reached an all-time high (ATH), whereas its market capitalization surged above the $2 billion mark.\n\nIt\u2019s Not Just Google Searches\n\nBesides becoming more popular on Google, Solana has succeeded in a few other fields. On-chain trading volume jumped to a peak of over $2.6 billion on December 22, staying above the $1.2 billion level until December 27, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s.\n\n\n\nIn the past few days, however, ETH reclaimed its lead, registering a trading volume of more than $2 billion on December 28 versus $1.1 billion for Solana.\n\nThe non-fungible token niche also witnessed some shifts.

        "content": "On Dec. 28, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin wrote a blog post, \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,\u201d in which he reflected on the early ideals of the blockchain movement, their connection with the open source software movement, and where the Ethereum Virtual Machine is headed. \u201cWe are not here to just create isolated tools and games, but rather [to] build holistically toward a more free and open society and economy, where the different parts\u2014technological, social and economic\u2014fit into each other,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cToday, even if the underlying code of an application is open and free, your data gets routed through a centralized server run by a corporation\u2026And so if we want to extend the spirit of open source software to the world of today, we need programs to have access to a shared hard drive to store things that multiple people need to modify and access,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nSteve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch\n\n\u201cCypherpunk\u201d is a movement that began in the late 1980s, advocating the use of technology to promote privacy and freedom for all. According to Buterin, he and his co-founder Gavin Wood thought of Ethereum as more than \u201cBitcoin plus smart contracts\u201d but as part of a set of cypherpunk tools that could create a global, distributed, permissionless open Internet stack.\n\nTo them, this was a natural extension of the ethos of open-source software. While OSS was conceived in a far less connected world, making changes on a single computer, blockchain technology makes the open source ethos practical on today\u2019s Internet.\n\nHe sees the EVM, together with technologies like decentralized file storage (IPFS), as a public, shared hard drive\u2014but is frustrated by the predominance of \u201cdegen gamblers\u201d in the Ethereum space. To him, that\u2019s because of the high fees on the network.\n\n\u201cWhen the cost of writing to the chain is $0.001, or even $0.1, you could imagine people making all kinds of applications that use blockchains in various ways, including non-financial ways. But when transaction fees go to over $100, as they have during the peak of the bull markets, there is exactly one audience that remains willing to play.\u201d Vitalik Buterin\n\nButerin remains hopeful that Ethereum can go back to this initial vision\u2014particularly as rollups, post-Tornado Cash privacy solutions, and zero-knowledge proofs come into wide use. \u201cThe growing awareness that unchecked centralization and over-financialization cannot be what \u201ccrypto is about,\u201d and the key technologies mentioned above that are finally coming to fruition together present us with an opportunity to take things in a different direction. Namely, to make at least a part of the Ethereum ecosystem actually be the permissionless, decentralized, censorship-resistant, open source ecosystem that we originally came to build,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBlast: We are building the best L2. Lock your eth with us.\n\n\n\nVitalik: hold my cup. pic.twitter.com/JhtKiHFJ4e \u2014 guru (@GuruCreates) December 29, 2023\n\nButerin hopes that projects coming into Ethereum focus on core values such as permissionlessness, open access to participation, auditability, credible neutrality, and censorship resistance\u2014even when so many come in for the money. \u201cResisting these pressures is hard, but if we do not do so, then we risk losing the unique value of the crypto ecosystem and recreating a clone of the existing web2 ecosystem with extra inefficiencies and extra steps,\u201d he continued.\n\nWeb3 community members received the post warmly, but a few people noticed a passage that could be seen as a dig at Blur\u2019s recently announced native-yield L2, Blast. \u201cIt is very possible to build things within the crypto ecosystem that do not follow these [decentralized] values. One can build a system that one calls a \u201clayer 2\u201d, but which is actually a highly centralized system secured by a multisig, with no plans to ever switch to something more secure,\u201d Buterin wrote."

        "title": "Ethereum Hits 52-Week High as Year Comes to an End: What to Expect in 2024? - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has given investors reasons to be positive about the upcoming year by reaching a 52-week high of $2,430. This latest surge comes on the heels of a volatile year for the second-largest cryptocurrency, which was not free from the effects of this year\u2019s economic uncertainty.\n\nIt was back in April of 2023 when Ethereum first surpassed the $2,000 resistance point before dropping in value again. While the price has increased by around 20% since then, ETH\u2019s value is still considerably lower than its all-time high of $4,878 two years ago.\n\nCrypto prices are higher across the board \u2013 and it looks like this rally could go much higher.\n\nWhat Is Driving Up Ethereum\u2019s Price?\n\nEthereum\u2019s price surge above $2,400 is directly linked to growing on-chain activity and recent regulatory activity. The network\u2019s daily transaction volume recently hit $3.92 billion, the highest since March of this year and more than 3 times that of October.\n\nThis activity is a direct result of Ethereum\u2019s solidified position across the DeFi, NFT, and gaming sectors, which keeps it a popular choice for developers creating their projects. At the same time, BlackRock\u2019s moves toward launching an Ethereum ETF have also fueled bullish speculation that directly translates to the adoption of the network.\n\nWith regulators continuing to take action against crypto\u2019s bad actors, institutional trust has also continued to increase over the past year. The fall of Sam Bankman-Fried, \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, and Alex Mashinsky were all well-received by lawmakers, investors, and major players in the industry. One example is Kraken\u2019s Co-Founder Jesse Powell\u2019s assertion that they could bring a \u201cmore fair\u201d ecosystem and clear the industry\u2019s reputation.\n\nWhat Will 2024 Bring for Ethereum?\n\nWith blockchain adoption and regulatory enforcement being likely to continue over the next year, investors believe the currency uptrend will continue in the new year. Crypto Youtuber Lark Davis, for example, took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to state his belief that Ethereum\u2019s rise to $10,000 was only a matter of time.\n\nEthereum is going to $10,000, when not if! \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 28, 2023\n\nDavis predicts that recently launched layer-2 protocols on Ethereum could spur short-term pumps that will maintain the uptrend. Such a move would also mean that if Ethereum were to replicate previous bull cycles, a price as high as $15,000 could be easily attainable.\n\nWith the launch of Ethereum\u2019s Dencun Testnet also set to be launched in 2024, the technical capabilities of the network will be significantly increased. This would put Ethereum on a direct collision course with so-called \u201cEthereum killers\u201d like Avalanche and Solana, both of which had experienced rapid growth thanks to their superior performance and scalability.\n\nCan Solana Truly Kill Ethereum?\n\nSolana\u2019s stunning resurgence poses a renewed threat to Ethereum\u2019s dominance of DeFi, Blockchain gaming, and decentralized applications. The network\u2019s high-speed architecture has powered trading volumes rivaling Ethereum\u2019s top DEX Uniswap, making it increasingly attractive to developers. This resulted in a surge in price of over 900% for the Ethereum killer in only one year, a performance no other top project could match.\n\nAnalysts have similarly found that while Solana was able to double its value in December alone, it has been outperformed by projects like Injective and NEAR. This trend suggests that Solana\u2019s surge might be primarily driven by Ethereum\u2019s high gas prices and the virality of its meme coins more than anything else.\n\nWith $1.5 billion total value locked, however, Solana still pales against Ethereum\u2019s $29 billion ecosystem. While the hype of the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d narrative has served server networks like Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano well over the years, it hasn\u2019t been enough. Rather than a true usurper yet, Solana seems to be benefiting from a renewed hype cycle that still needs to translate to increased adoption.\n\nRegardless, most tokens will move higher next year, the only question is by how much."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: For nearly a month, the Ethereum(ETH) has been trading sideways resonating within two horizontal levels of $2400 and $2137. On December 28th, the daily chart showed a long-wick rejection candle at this overhead resistance reflecting the presence of high supply pressure. This selling pressure aligned with current market uncertainty hints at a possibility of potential correction as ETH may develop a double-top pattern.\n\nAlso Read: Vitalik Buterin Proposes Solutions for Ethereum PoS Complexity\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs ETH Price Heading Back to the $1850 Mark?\n\nA Double Top pattern puts ETH price at 20% downside risk\n\nA lower high formation in the daily RSI slope reflects weakening bullish momentum.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $12.3 Billion, indicating a 23% loss.\n\nIn the last three weeks, the Ethereum price has shown two reversals from the $2400 resistance level, reflecting that the sellers are aggressively defending this level. A look at the daily time frame chart has shown this rejection as the formation of a bearish reversal pattern called \u2018double top\u2019.\n\nIn the last 48 hours, the ETH price has plunged 3.55% currently trading at $2303. With sustained selling, the coin price will attempt a break below the ascending trendline which has acted as a dynamic support for the past two months.\n\nThis breakdown would accelerate the supple pressure and bolster sellers to challenge the neckline resistance of $2135. Should the Ethereum coin break below this level, the sellers may prolong the correction another 13.5% to hit the $1850 mark.\n\nCrypto Analyst Hints A Rally to $3593\n\nWhile the current market correction and bearish pattern formation give a bearish outlook to the Ethereum price, the coin buyers can get an opportunity to counterattack at $2135. This neckline support aligned close with the 50-day EMA slope creates a strong demand area.\n\nIn addition, a renowned crypto analyst JacobCanfield added in his recent X-platform post that the ETH price has successfully retested this Weekly support($2124), suggesting it could act as a suitable launchpad to trigger a rally to $3583.\n\nThus, if the coin price shows suitability or buyers accumulation at the $2135-$2124 region, the aforementioned bearish thesis will be invalidated.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): A bearish divergence in the daily RSI slope increasing the possibility for a price correction.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The rising daily EMAs (20, 50, 100, and 200) hint the overall trend remains bullish.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "title": "Vitalik Proposes 3 Paths to Enhance ETH Network Efficiency - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has unveiled radical solutions to transform the ETH network.\n\nThe proposed changes have aimed to simplify Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism while enhancing security.\n\nThe proposed overhaul has promised improved accessibility for new users.\n\nTo address the complexity and scalability limitations of Ethereum\u2019s current signature method, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined three alternative approaches that aim to enhance the overall efficiency and user experience of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nButerin\u2019s Proposed Solutions to Ethereum\u2019s Scalability Issues\n\nApproach 1: Go All-in on Decentralized Staking Pools\n\nFirstly, Buterin proposed a significant reduction in the number of validators by setting a minimum deposit requirement of 4096 ETH and a maximum cap of 4096 validators. This would significantly lower the computational burden on the network and simplify the consensus mechanism.\n\nApproach 2: Two-Tiered Staking\n\nAlternatively, Buterin suggested implementing a two-tier staking system, where validators would be divided into the \u2018heavy\u2019 layer and the \u2018light\u2019 layer. The heavy layer would be composed of validators with a 4096 ETH minimum deposit, responsible for core consensus mechanisms.\n\nThe light layer would include validators with no minimum deposit, contributing to overall network security without the same level of direct involvement in consensus.\n\nApproach 3: Rotating Participation (i.e., Committees but Accountable)\n\nFinally, Buterin proposed a rotating participation approach, where a subset of 4096 validators would be randomly selected for each slot to participate in consensus. This would ensure a diverse and dynamic validator set while maintaining efficiency and scalability.\n\nButerin Proposes Significant Network Overhaul\n\nButerin argues that the rotating participation approach is the best way to balance the need for accountability with the need for decentralization. It would allow for a more decentralized staking system without sacrificing security.\n\nHe also argues that the overall security of the Ethereum network would be improved by reducing the number of signatures per slot. This would make it less expensive to attack the network and make it more difficult for attackers to succeed.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal is a significant departure from the current design of the Ethereum network. It would require a major overhaul of the consensus protocol and likely face resistance from some stakeholders.\n\nHowever, Buterin argues that the benefits of his proposal are too great to ignore. He believes it would make the Ethereum network more secure, decentralized, and accessible to new users.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nReducing the number of validators drastically to 4096 could potentially cause a concentration of power among a smaller group.\n\nWhile the proposed aims are noble, the practicality and successful execution of them remain uncertain and could face substantial hurdles.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe proposed changes outlined by Vitalik Buterin could revolutionize Ethereum\u2019s structure. With Ethereum holding a prominent position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, these alterations may redefine the Ethereum network itself and potentially reshape the broader landscape of the crypto industry.\n\nTo learn more about former President Trump\u2019s sale of $2.5M worth of ETH following disappointing Mugshot NFT sales, read here:\n\nTrump Sells $2.5M ETH Upon Disappointing Mugshot NFT Sales\n\n\n\nTo explore further how Ethereum exploits contribute to 70% of all DeFi losses in 2023, read here:\n\nEthereum Exploits Account for 70% of all DeFi Losses in 2023"

        "content": "Ethereum needs to reignite the \u201ccypherpunk\u201d revolution that was first envisioned for the blockchain in its early days, says Vitalik Buterin, one of the network\u2019s founders.\n\nAccording to a Dec. 28 blog post from Buterin, Ethereum was initially envisioned as a \u201cpublic decentralized shared hard drive\u201d that could leverage peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage, but the vision began to fade in 2017 with the turn toward financialization on Ethereum.\n\nDecentralization, open participation, censorship resistance and credible neutrality are among the \u201ccypherpunk\u201d values Buterin wants to see firmly return to Ethereum\u2019s future, and he remains hopeful that non-financial applications can flourish on the blockchain.\n\nHe highlighted that rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction and second-generation privacy solutions have become more mainstream, which could uphold some of these cypherpunk values.\n\nCypherpunk refers to a person who uses encryption to ensure privacy when accessing a computer network, especially from government authorities.\n\nThis is Ethereum\n\n\n\nThis is why we are here pic.twitter.com/onMU20q9w2 \u2014 sassal.eth/acc (@sassal0x) December 29, 2023\n\nParticipating in polls without revealing one\u2019s privacy and implementing mechanisms such as quadratic voting and cross-tribal consensus finding to help organizations govern themselves are among the other cypherpunk-like activities that Buterin wants to see more of on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the stack is to enable this pluralism, but that the same time strive for growing interoperability across this plurality.\u201d https://t.co/ExE0ILc2Vl pic.twitter.com/2IXkHMf5b7 \u2014 dr3a.eth (@dr3a_eth) December 28, 2023\n\n\u201cIt is very possible to build things within the crypto ecosystem that do not follow these values,\u201d Buterin conceded, hinting at certain examples.\n\nFor example, building a highly centralized layer secured by multisignature with no plans to change or a nonfungible token ecosystem where the NFTs are stored on a centralized website instead of a decentralized file storage platform like IPFS.\n\n\u201cOne could build a staking interface that needlessly funnels users toward the already-largest staking pool,\u201d Buterin added:\n\n\u201cResisting these pressures is hard, but if we do not do so, then we risk losing the unique value of the crypto ecosystem, and recreating a clone of the existing web2 ecosystem with extra inefficiencies and extra steps.\u201d\n\nThat said, Buterin said he\u2019s been impressed with solutions that have come about from some of the industry\u2019s biggest problems.\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin warns against overloading Ethereum consensus layer\n\nHe noted that decentralized exchanges have provided a solution to hacks on centralized exchanges, while Cowswap, Flashbots Protect and MEV Blocker have helped limit the severity of sandwich attacks on Ethereum users by maximum extractable value exploiters.\n\nVarious problems and solutions have been addressed in the Ethereum ecosystem. Source: Vitalik.eth\n\nOn Dec. 28, Buterin proposed to make the Ethereum proof-of-stake chain lighter and simpler by reducing the number of signatures that validators are required to make to keep the network running.\n\nMagazine: 'Account abstraction\u2019 supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide"

        "content": "Tron Founder Justin Sun has eulogized Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum protocol for his technological insights. In the long post, he shared on the X platform, the Tron Founder also mentioned the role he played in Ethereum\u2019s early development while also disclosing the similarities he shares with the Ethereum co-founder.\n\nTron Founder Aligning Interests With Vitalik Buterin\n\nJustin Sun revealed that his relationship with Vitalik Buterin is longer than most people in the industry realize. He said his encounter with Vitalik dates back to 2015 when he just entered Jack Ma\u2019s Hupan University in a bid to make a dive into the crypto world.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe said he and Vitalik Buterin discussed Ethereum, the crypto project that just launched at the time. While the Tron Founder acknowledged he had bought a massive quantity of Ethereum at the time, he said there was no active wallet to store the acquired assets. This made him suggest to Vitalik that there is a need to build a decentralized wallet with many prototypes presented to him by the latter.\n\nJustin Sun acknowledged that though after close to a decade, he and Vitalik Buterin are building in different ways, the underlying ideology remains the same. The Tron Founder said he and Vitalik agree on the concept of decentralization. He believes that should a protocol founder be taken out, the network ought to run effectively no matter what.\n\nCommenting on \u201cauditability,\u201d Justin Sun said, \u201canyone should be able to verify the logic of applications and continuously run a full node to ensure that the program runs according to the instructions of open-source documentation.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for other core blockchain concepts including open global participation and neutrality among other concepts.\n\nJustin Sun in the Broader Crypto World\n\nJustin Sun has a huge profile in the crypto world and he controls many of the popular applications in the industry. Besides Tron Blockchain, Sun also owns the BitTorrent protocol as well as the Poloniex Exchange, and Huobi Global, and his transactional activities are well followed by top market trackers.\n\nDespite his role in the industry, Justin Sun has been the subject of many critic\u2019s backlashes, especially in the wake of the Poloniex exchange\u2019s hack. Overall, Justin Sun believes in the future of blockchain technology and he has reiterated the commitment to maintaining the ethos of decentralization moving forward."

        "content": "The Ethereum Layer 2 transactions skyrocketed by over 330% in 2023 compared to the last year. In recent months, Ethereum\u2019s scaling solutions have experienced a notable uptick in interest, marked by the frequent introduction of new Layer 2s (L2s).\n\nOne of the latest players in this dynamic landscape is Coinbase\u2019s Base L2, which gripped the attention of crypto enthusiasts. While Base had a significant share in these transactions, Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) emerged as the largest contributors.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum L2 Transactions Overview\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock analytics, the Ethereum L2 ecosystem recorded a total of 583.53 million transactions in 2023. This suggests a staggering increase of 332.08% from 2022\u2019s figure of 135.05 million. The largest contribution in the 2023 transactions was made by Arbitrum which accounted for a 64.01% share.\n\nOn the other hand, Optimism and Base held a share of 22.22% and 13.77% share, respectively. Furthermore, it\u2019s worth noting that the 2023 Ethereum L2 transaction data indicates an unprecedented growth from 2021. Since the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem was fairly new in 2021, the number of transactions was recorded to be 6.24 million, which indicates a whopping increase of 9,251% since then.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price: Analyst Predicts 22% Surge In Ethereum (ETH) Price Sparking Market Optimism\n\nFurthermore, in a recent post on X, IntoTheBlock highlighted that the weekly transactions since 2021 have increased by 90 times. The weekly transactions hit a high of 18 million in 2023 while in 2021, it was less than a million.\n\nArbitrum And Optimism\u2019s Recent Performance\n\nOwing to the growing popularity of the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem, the ARB and OP prices have gained significantly lately. In the past seven days, the ARB price locked in profits of over 8% while OP surged by 13%. In addition, the ARB crypto soared by more than 43% in the past month whereas OP skyrocketed by 117%.\n\nHowever, at the time of writing, both these digital assets saw a significant drop in value due to the ongoing bearish trend of the market. At press time, the ARB price was recorded at $1.45, plunging by 5.56%. The ARB market cap stood at $1.84 billion, down by 5.72%. Moreover, the 24-hour trade volume slumped by 23.54% to $617.02 million.\n\nWhilst, the OP crypto price dipped by 2.41% to $3.65. The crypto\u2019s market cap was recorded at $3.32 billion, marking a decline of 2.43%. However, the 24-hour trade volume registered a significant increase of 11.73% to 589.94 million.\n\nAlso Read: Optimism And Immutable Price Rally Continues With Monthly Gains Of Over 75%"

        "content": "After $11 billion in annual options delivery on Friday, Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to close the year below $44,000 and $2400 levels. As BTC and ETH continued to rally this year due to rising open interests (OI), a record rise in funding rates stalled the rally at the end of the year.\n\nBTC price rallied 170% and ETH price leaped 105% this year. Experts anticipate further rally after the funding rates decline gradually.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum OI and Funding Rates\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum futures open interest (OI) fell after Friday\u2019s expiry and recent crypto market selloffs this week. However, traders remain positive on further upsides.\n\nAs per current data, the total Bitcoin futures OI on all exchanges is over $18 billion. BTC OI on CME and Binance are $4.81 billion and $4.31 billion, rising again after the recent wipe out. Deribit, Coinbase, Bybit, OKX, and others have similar figures.\n\nThe total Ethereum futures OI is $3.36 million. ETH OI on the top three futures crypto exchanges Binance, Bybit, and OKX are rising after a massive drop.\n\nCrypto influencer Kamikaz shared that OI is totally wiped on BTC and ETH after expiry but funding remains higher as people are scared to short due to spot Bitcoin ETF approval sentiment. He says it is super bullish and wants to long.\n\nPopular analyst CredibleCrypto agreed with Kamikaz that the market is bullish. He explained that people are mistaking high funding rates for an excess of over-leveraged participants. In reality, OI is completely wiped at levels not witnessed in the last few years. He said, \u201cfunding is only relatively high because the few that are levered are predominantly directional longs.\u201d\n\nFunding rates are also actually falling from the record high. The BTC OI-weighted funding rate chart indicates probability of upside movement in the next few days.\n\nAlso Read:"

        "content": "A top crypto strategist says that one Ethereum (ETH) competitor may be setting the stage for another explosive move to the upside.\n\nPseudonymous trader Bluntz tells his 233,800 followers on the social media platform X that Solana (SOL) appears to be in the midst of an ABC corrective pattern.\n\nBluntz utilizes the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis. The theory attempts to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. A bullish asset tends to witness an ABC correction wave before igniting the next leg up, according to the theory.\n\n\u201cLove seeing the SOL obituaries on the TL (X timeline). Can\u2019t wait to see the 20 million hedged tweets people will manage to rustle up from somewhere vaguely insinuating they called it when SOL turbo reverses to $140.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $104.42 at time of writing, after starting off the year trading for under $10.\n\nThe trader has remained bullish on Solana as SOL began dropping from a recent high of nearly $124. As SOL retraced to the $113 level, the trader predicted SOL would eventually move to new local highs. However, it subsequently dipped temporarily below $100.\n\n\u201cNice little 12% dip there on SOL in a monster uptrend with a few more legs to go imo (in my opinion) on the BTC pair and USD pair. Don\u2019t fight the trend.\u201d\n\nThe trader also suggests that the ETH layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB) is about to take off after an ABC corrective wave.\n\n\u201cARB looks amazing here. In fact, so many charts do right now.

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently seen a significant increase in its market performance.\n\nVarious factors possibly contributing to ETH\u2019s surge include the increased trading volume and a rise in daily active addresses.\n\nThe article discusses future projections for ETH, including opinions from analysts and potential impacts on Ethereum-related cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhy is the Ethereum (ETH) Price up?\n\nEthereum\u2019s native token \u2013 ETH \u2013 was among the best-performing crypto assets on December 28, with its price surpassing $2,400 (the highest level since May 2022). Consequently, its market capitalization briefly exceeded the $292 billion tag. Despite retracing from its yesterday\u2019s peak, \u0415TH is still up around 13% in the past 30 days.\n\n\n\nETH\u2019s price increase is in line with the development of other important on-chain metrics.\n\nFor instance, the Total Value Locked in the network has increased from around $25b at the beginning of the month to almost $30b at the end.\n\nMoreover, the on-chain trading volumes of Ethereum have also seen an uptick, remaining above $1 billion per day for the larger part of December and exceeding $2 billion on December 28th.\n\nEthereum daily active addresses have jumped, too. YCharts estimated that their number hit almost 500,000 on December 28, representing a 33% increase compared to the observed data a month ago.\n\n\n\nThe Recent Altcoin Resurgence\n\nETH\u2019s price jump is also part of the overall Altcoin rally. Despite slightly retracing in the past few hours, Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Polkadot (DOT), and more are well in the green for the last week, while Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a minor correction.\n\nThe aforementioned trend has led to a reduced BTC dominance. This is the metric that tracks its share relative to that of the rest of the market, and it\u2019s currently sitting at around 47.8% (per CoinGecko), down from 50% at the beginning of December."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price is encountering significant resistance around the pivotal $2.4K region, highlighting an ongoing struggle between buyers and sellers.\n\nDespite efforts, the price has been unable to surpass its previous swing high of $2403, leading to a slight pullback and the potential formation of a double-top pattern.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nAfter a period of sideways consolidation near the crucial $2.3K mark, the price surged with the aim of reclaiming its previous daily swing high at $2403. This upward movement is underscored by the occurrence of a golden cross on the daily chart, indicating an overall bullish sentiment for Ethereum\u2019s price action.\n\nHowever, the price faced resistance upon reaching a critical zone formed by the upper boundary of a multi-month wedge, coinciding with the previous daily swing at $2403, thereby forming a potential double-top pattern.\n\nDespite these challenges, the emergence of a potential head and shoulders pattern, a widely recognized bearish reversal formation, is notable. If the price breaks below the neckline of both the head and shoulders pattern and the double-top pattern, it could signal a short-term downward movement. This retracement might lead the price back to the substantial support range at $2K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nA more detailed analysis of the 4-hour chart reveals increased demand within the critical range between the 0.5 ($2,211) and 0.618 ($2,166) levels of the Fibonacci retracement indicator. This demand led to an impulsive price spike attempting to breach the $2.4K daily swing high.\n\nHowever, Ethereum faced a slight rejection, resulting in a retracement toward the static support level at $2.3K. Despite this retracement, Ethereum\u2019s price appears to be confined within a crucial range, encompassing the significant $2.4K resistance region and the substantial static support range characterized by the 0.5 ($2,211) and 0.618 ($2,166) Fibonacci retracement levels, along with the dynamic support provided by the multi-week ascending trendline.\n\nA breakout in either direction from this range could signal the initiation of a new impulsive trend.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nWithin the domain of on-chain data analysis, exploring the sentiment reflected in the futures market provides valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s overarching perspective.\n\nThe provided chart portrays the 30-day standard moving average of the Ethereum taker buy-sell ratio. This metric indicates whether buyers or sellers are executing more aggressively on aggregate (taker orders). Values below 1 are perceived as bearish, while values above 1 are indicative of bullish sentiment.\n\nUpon examination of the chart, a notable trend emerges: the taker buy-sell ratio has consistently remained below 1 over the past six months.\n\nDespite the recent uptrend in price, the metric has entered a consolidation phase, signaling an overall bearish sentiment among futures traders. Should the taker buy-sell ratio suddenly surge above 1 again, it would suggest a shift to a full-fledged bull market, potentially propelling the price to new yearly highs."

The 24-hour trading volume surged by a whopping 79% to $955.83 million.

        "title": "Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Says Original Web3 Vision Has Been Lost - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "In a new blog post, Vitalik Buterin noted the loss of the original web3 values, the ways that the community can get back on track, and the progress that Ethereum has made so far.\n\nVitalik Buterin has always been a big personality. As one of the founders of Ethereum, he has been a major figure within the crypto world for over a decade. He is also known for being outspoken about his views, which has sometimes led to him feuding with others. But his most recent blog post, published by Buterin on his personal blog, seems him calling out the current culture within the crypto industry and claiming that the initial vision of web3 has been lost.\n\nButerin Speaking on the Lost Vision of Web3\n\nIn the post titled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again\u201d, Buterin recalled several trips he took in the early 2010s to places in the world that had a concentration of crypto businesses. He had said that this sort of community where all parts work together was the initial goal of Web3.\n\nBut with time, he says this vision has not been preserved. According to him, some in the decentralization community see crypto as a distraction as opposed to a useful tool. And even among crypto users, he notes that the only non-financial application that is being used on a large scale is the Ethereum Naming Service (ENS). When crypto is used as a means of payment or transfers, Buterin points out that it is done, \u201ceither through internal transfers on centralized exchange accounts, or by trading USDT on Tron.\u201d\n\nAnd what is to blame for this? According to Buterin, transaction fees are the number one culprit. He says that when the cost of writing to the chain is $0.001 or $0.1, there is more potential use of it, even for non-financial reasons. But when transaction fees cross the $100 mark during bull runs, the major group that remains is degen gamblers. In moderation, he believes that they are not too much of a risk but that there are too many of them in the community.\n\nEthereum Now and Beyond\n\nIn the blog post, Buterin highlighted some of the positive developments that have taken place in the Ethereum community. He talked about the launch of rollups and second-generation privacy solutions like Railway and Nocturne. He also acknowledged zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and light clients as benefiting the network in terms of scale, user privacy, and much more.\n\nHe pointed out that there is a growing understanding that unchecked centralization and over-financialization cannot be the essence of crypto and that other values must be embraced. Some of the values he highlighted were auditability, censorship resistance, decentralization, open global participation, and so on.\n\nThe blog ended on an optimistic note about the Ethereum network and could hint at even more developments being rolled out in 2024. From what we\u2019ve seen, Buterin believes that a change needs to come to the crypto and blockchain scene and we could see the results of this very soon."

        "content": "What\u2019s Behind Solana\u2019s Recent Surge\n\nSolana Flipped Ethereum in Google Search Interest\n\nGoogle searches for the term \"Solana\" surpassed \"Ethereum\" for the first time in 2023, indicating growing interest in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nFrom December 17 to 23, Solana's search interest score reached 56, while Ethereum's was 50. Google Trends data suggests that Solana's search interest is set to peak during the week of December 24 to 30, with a score of 100.\n\nUsers searching for Solana also showed interest in terms like \"bonk\" and \"tensor.\" Bonk (BONK) is the leading Solana memecoin that reached a peak market cap of $1.9 billion after being listed on Binance and Coinbase, while Tensor is the leading NFT marketplace on Solana, after surpassing Magic Eden in trading volume.\n\nSolana\u2019s DEX Volumes and NFT Sales Surpassed Ethereum\u2019s\n\nOn December 23, Solana surpassed Ethereum in weekly decentralized exchange (DEX) volume and non-fungible token (NFT) sales.\n\nDEX volume on Solana surged to over $10 billion, surpassing Ethereum's $8.8 billion for that week. Meanwhile, Solana also processed $109 million in NFT sales in that week, eclipsing Ethereum by $30 million.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is leading in terms of DEX volumes, with $10.12 billion compared to Solana\u2019s $8.71 billion. However, Solana\u2019s NFT sales volume is still ahead of Ethereum\u2019s, although Bitcoin is leading due to the recent Ordinals frenzy.\n\nThe current frenzy on Solana is partly driven by memecoins, particularly BONK, which has skyrocketed by 300% in December and has a market cap of over $1 billion. Another Solana-based memecoin, Dogwifhat, has also gained 428% in the past week.\n\nSolana Flipped BNB in Market Cap Momentarily\n\nOn December 22, Solana surged by 18% to overtake BNB (BNB), propelling it to 4th place in terms of market capitalization. SOL traded at a market cap of $41.9 billion, surpassing BNB, which had a market cap of $41.8 billion.\n\nThis surge came after SOL overtook XRP in market cap on December 21. However, BNB has since regained its position after gaining over 17% in the past week. BNB is currently trading at a market cap of $47.8 million, compared to SOL\u2019s market cap of $43.7 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nSOL gained over 71% in the past month, outperforming many large-cap cryptocurrencies such as ETH, which has only gained 12.4%.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Reason Behind Solana\u2019s Recent Rally?\n\nSolana's recent price surge can be attributed to several factors, including:\n\nIncreased User Activity\n\nActive addresses on Solana have increased by nearly 400% in the last three months, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s in mid-November. This suggests an exceptional increase in retail activity, with crypto users likely migrating to Solana for its lower transaction costs, increased speculative activity, airdrop farming and more.\n\nAirdrops and Memecoins Caused Surge in DEX Volume\n\nRecent airdrops on Solana, particularly the Jito (JTO) airdrop worth five figures, have resulted in more users flocking to other Solana-based protocols in hopes of securing a future airdrop. Furthermore, memecoins trading craze, led by the Bonk memecoin, have boosted speculative user activity, causing the DEX volume on Solana to surpass Ethereum\u2019s for a week. Other memecoins on Solana, like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Silly Dragon (SILLY), also saw millions in daily volume on-chain, contributing to the rise in DEX volumes.\n\nInstitutional Capital Flows Into Solana\n\nSource: CoinShares\n\nSolana-based investment funds attracted $156 million in institutional inflows as of December 16, making it the crypto asset with the highest inflows behind only Bitcoin, suggesting robust institutional interest in Solana."

Ethereum remained a slugger for quite some time but decided to rally a week ago as Bitcoin slipped into consolidation.\n\nSince then, many Ethereum-related altcoins have pumped. The tokens that pumped initially were the newly launched altcoins like PYTH, PENDLE, and TIA, but slowly, older altcoins like UNI, ETC, AAVE are starting to play catch-up.\n\nCrypto Twitter, more commonly known as CT, addresses this trading strategy as \u201cETH-beta,\u201d which relates to altcoins that are associated with ETH.\n\nAlso read: \u201cBitcoin is so back\u201d says Messari, as Inscriptions account for 21% of total fees in 2023\n\nAAVE holders in for a treat\n\nAave price slipped below the $116 and $107 support levels on May 9, 2022. Since then, multiple attempts have been made to push the altcoin higher, but all were in vain. AAVE largely remained unfazed when Bitcoin price dropped on December 28, so the ongoing struggle to flip $116 into a support floor likely has legs.\n\nA risky bet would be to accumulate AAVE at $107 should there be an intraday dip. This buying activity would be with the expectation that Aave price flips the aforementioned key hurdle.\n\nIn total, the rally from $116 to $162 would constitute a 40% gain.\n\nAAVE/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Aave price breaks the $107 support level and flips it into a resistance level, it would be the first sign of bullish failure. In such a case, if AAVE breached the $95 support level, it would create a lower low and invalidate the optimistic outlook detailed above.\n\nThis development could also see Aave price crash 20% to collect the liquidity resting below the October 27 swing low at $75.\n\nRead more: XRP price is coming up on an important directional breakout as Ripple fills multi-year triangle"

        "content": "In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, ongoing discussions center around optimal investment choices among Bitcoin, Ethereum, and alternative coins. Notably, crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, sharing insights on the X platform, explores the nuances of this market, highlighting the growing potential of altcoins amid the surging popularity of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nSo, let\u2019s unravel the insights into altcoin investments, the contrasting trajectories of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the strategic considerations for navigating the crypto space.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAltcoins On The Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nThe popular cryptocurrency analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe\u2019s analysis sheds light on the cyclical nature of crypto markets, emphasizing the recent resurgence in hype and sentiment. Notable performers like Solana and Injective have demonstrated remarkable surges, raising the question of whether altcoins remain a viable investment.\n\nMeanwhile, Van de Poppe acknowledges the market\u2019s ebb and flow, where specific segments outshine others due to ongoing rotations. Highlighting the success of the Solana ecosystem and its memecoin rallying by over 50x, the analyst cautions against blindly following coins hyped on social media.\n\nIn addition, he advises investors to scrutinize potential returns and risks, emphasizing the diminishing upside and increased volatility of projects that have already experienced substantial gains. The key takeaway is the importance of critical thinking and a discerning approach in a market often fueled by hype.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin, Ethereum Drop While ORDI Shines In Crypto Market\n\nBitcoin Vs. Ethereum: Analyst Decodes Investment Potential\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s analysis extends to the perennial debate between Bitcoin and Ethereum, exploring the recent success of Bitcoin price with an 80% return in eight weeks. However, as the momentum slows during the holiday week, questions arise about whether Bitcoin can sustain further upward trends.\n\nNotably, he also mentioned that the upcoming and much-anticipated Bitcoin Spot ETF might help BTC to keep the upward momentum in the coming days. In addition, the analyst suggests a potential shift towards Ethereum, which, despite recent challenges, is poised for growth with a Bitcoin Spot ETF expected in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, the contrasting trajectories of Bitcoin and Ethereum highlight the nuanced decision-making required in the crypto space. While Bitcoin may see a surge towards $50,000, Ethereum\u2019s potential rally to $3,000-3,500 appears a more reasonable approach, considering its correction against the BTC pair, he suggested.\n\nIn essence, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe\u2019s insights underscore the importance of diversification, critical evaluation, and a forward-thinking mindset in navigating the ever-dynamic crypto market. As the industry evolves, strategic decisions that go beyond fleeting hype become paramount for sustainable and profitable investments.\n\nAlso Read: Bitwise Holds Edge Over BlackRock With 20x Seed Fund"

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Holders Diversify: What About Axie Infinity (AXS) and Everlodge (ELDG)? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s superiority has shown over the last two months. The project\u2019s value has spiked to over $2,300, and Ethereum\u2019s daily trading volume has consistently hit over $10 billion across on-chain and centralized exchanges.\n\nTwo projects that could be worth watching are Axie Infinity and Everlodge. A recent update could reignite the fire behind Axie Infinity, and Everlodge\u2019s value continues to rise as its presale booms.\n\nEthereum ETF Delayed by The SEC\n\nOver the last 7 days, Ethereum has declined by 0.1%, and its daily trading volume has dropped to $9.7 billion. This decline has been triggered by two events.\n\nFirstly, the overall crypto market\u2019s growth has slowed. Many projects are down by over 5%, and investment activity has also declined. Secondly, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision on several Ethereum Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) applications.\n\nAccording to James Seyffart, Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst, delays have been made on applications from Hashdex and Grayscale, which were expected to be resolved before December 25th. The SEC has stated that the reason behind this delay is to gather more public input as to whether or not the Ethereum ETFs should be listed.\n\nAxie Infinity Looks To Rebuild Its Community\n\nIf you asked an NFT expert about the top P2E games ever created, Axie Infinity would be on this list. Axie Infinity rose to fame in 2021, though its value crashed following the 2022 bull market. Now, the project announced that it plans to rebuild its community through exclusive merchandise.\n\nAxie Infinity holders who own Mystic and Origin Axies will now be able to create their own exclusive merchandise. This decision is expected to help rebuild the Axie Infinity brand, and has so far been met with a positive reaction. In the last month, Axie Infinity\u2019s native token, AXS, has increased in value by 15.88%, and experts believe that Axie Infinity could begin to attract new players in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, Axie Infinity released a number of features, including a new evolution for players to enjoy. However, given that the game still has a long way to go, Everlodge could be a more profitable investment.\n\nEverlodge Introduces Fractionalized Holiday Home Investments\n\nAs Ethereum investors begin to diversify, more are buying Everlodge as the project continues to gain momentum. In Q4, the project sold out 7 presale stages, and its native token, $ELDG, is now selling at $0.027 per token.\n\nEverlodge is the world\u2019s first decentralized marketplace for holiday homes. Here, users can buy, sell, and invest in some of the world\u2019s most beautiful and profitable travel real estate. The Everlodge marketplace promises to connect travel property buyers and sellers while removing the market\u2019s barriers to entry.\n\nAfter signing up and creating their account, investors will be able to look through the Everlodge marketplace for properties on sale. They can then buy an NFT fraction that represents equity in the property. The NFTs smart contract will contain all transactional data, including the deed to the property.\n\nOnce an investor purchases equity in a property, they will generate a monthly income from it. This income will range based on how much the property makes, in addition to how much equity an investor owns. The higher their equity, the more they\u2019ll earn.\n\nThis unique ecosystem promises to also offer a launchpad for property developers, free stays for ELDG token holders, and more.\n\nVisit Everlodge Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "Legendary trader Peter Brandt recently devoted time to school Ethereum (ETH) proponents on charting skills as he makes an effort to water down the coin\u2019s strides.\n\nTaking to his official account on X, Peter Brandt said what many call the Ascending Triangle in Ethereum\u2019s price is technically incorrect. Using his charting experience, Peter Brandt pointed out reasons why he believes the pattern in Ethereum is not an ascending triangle.\n\nAn ascending Triangle is a bullish chart formation that generally depicts an uptrend that is imminent in consonance with rising volume. Whenever the price breaks about the upper horizontal line, the asset may continue its ascent unless bigger market forces impact the trend.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nPeter Brandt\u2019s Thesis\n\nAccording to the trader, the correct starting point for the Ethereum pattern was August 2022 and not April 2022 when the coin touched a local high. In reality, Peter Brandt labeled the April 2022 price action as one that is part of a preceding bear trend.\n\n1/\n\nInsight into charting\n\nMany youngstas in noobersville have insisted that the pattern in $ETH is an ascending triangle\n\nIt is not so.\n\nThe correct starting point for this pattern was Aug 2022 high, NOT Apr 2022 high. Apr '22 price action was part of preceding bear trend pic.twitter.com/yFvPj2ul3n \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 28, 2023\n\nLooking at the all-time Ethereum chart, this latter statement is correct as the $3,522.36 price high gained in April 2022 comes as the coin receded from the All-Time High (ATH) of $4,891.70 in November 2021.\n\nPeter Brandt clarified that Ascending Triangles have horizontal upper boundaries as defined earlier. When zoomed out, the April 2023 high is $120 higher than the August 2022 that many people failed to acknowledge as the starting point in the ascending triangle pattern plot.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNonetheless, Brandt acknowledged that this charting mode matters a little as the \u201cmeasuring implications for determining targets are roughly the same for an asc tri and running wedge.\u201d\n\nHe concluded by noting that in the end \u201cbeauty can be in the eye of the beholder,\u201d underscoring how different traders can interpret data differently.\n\nThe Unending Ethereum Criticism\n\nPeter Brandt has made headlines on more than one occasion for calling out Ethereum as an asset that is destined to fall. Notably, Peter Brandt acknowledged recently that he shorted ETH as he believed it could fall below the $1000 price level, and likely to $650.\n\nAs part of his bearish projections on Ethereum, the legendary trader is convinced the second-largest digital currency may not be a listed asset in the next 10 years, owing to its high gas fees."

However, this vision began to fade in 2017 with the turn towards the \u201cfinancialization\u201d of the protocol, Buterin states.\n\nDecentralization, open participation, resistance to censorship, and trustworthy neutrality are among the \u201ccypherpunk\u201d ideals Buterin wants to see in the future of Ethereum. He emphasized that rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and second-generation privacy solutions that have become more common on the network, tenets that support the core cypherpunk values.\n\nButerin also said he was impressed by some of the developments created to solve the industry\u2019s biggest problems. He called decentralized exchanges (DEX) that provide improved tools for protection positive industry developments, mentioning Cowswap, Flashbots Protect, and MEV Blocker that helped limit \u201csandwich attacks\u201d on Ethereum users.\n\n\u201cEthereum is a dark forest where on-chain traders are constantly vulnerable to getting exploited [\u2026] This is also true in other ways: smart contracts regularly get hacked, users\u2019 wallets regularly get hacked, centralized exchanges fail even more spectacularly, etc.\u201d Vitalik Buterin\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin\u2019s new proposal would cut Ethereum\u2019s security\n\nSome X users were encouraged by Vitalik\u2019s plans, especially regarding cryptocurrency payments for retail clients.

At press time, this was 13.79 transactions.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum was five places behind with an average transaction per second (TPS) count of 13.72.\n\nThe surge in transaction volume on zkSync is linked to the introduction of inscriptions on the chain and across various Ethereum Virtual Machine-enabled (EVM) networks.\n\nData from a Dune Analytics dashboard prepared by analyst Hildoby showed that when inscriptions were first introduced to zkSync on 16th December, the scaling solution recorded its highest monthly transaction surge.\n\nFor context, on that day, inscriptions-based transactions constituted 87% of the 5.3 million total transactions completed on zkSync. Also, on the same day, its TPS climbed to a high of 62.07.\n\nData from L2Beat showed that this was zkSync\u2019s highest observed TPS averaged over a single-day period.\n\nzkSync in 2023\n\nSince its launch in February, zkSync has steadily grown in user activity. According to data from Token Terminal, its monthly count of active users has since risen by a whopping 3,000,000 %.\n\nIn its first month, the network\u2019s user count totaled 69. With two days left till the end of December, it has recorded a user count of 2.7 million this month.\n\nDecember\u2019s figure already stands at a 12% increase from the 2.4 million active users zkSync registered in November.\n\nAs user activity grew, network fees and protocol revenue rallied as well. However, by May, monthly fees and revenue peaked at $10.2 million and have since trended downward.\n\nSo far this month, zkSync\u2019s fees and revenue are $7 million each, seeing a 42% rise in the last 30 days.\n\nRegarding network total value locked (TVL), zkSync\u2019s TVL was $160.24 million, according to data from DefiLlama. This initiated an uptick on 20th November and has since increased by 20%."

Second-generation privacy solutions, including projects like Railway and Nocturne, are enhancing user confidentiality.\n\nHe also mentioned the concept of account abstraction is gaining traction, enabling users to interact with smart contracts without the need for native cryptocurrency holdings, making Ethereum more accessible.\n\nProgress in the development of light clients is reducing resource requirements and increasing network accessibility. Zero knowledge proofs, once considered a distant technology, are becoming more developer-friendly, offering enhanced privacy and verification capabilities.\n\nThe blog post also emphasizes a return to core values within the crypto community, including open global participation, decentralization, and a cooperative mindset.\n\nThese updates collectively aim to address scalability concerns, reduce transaction fees, and bolster privacy and security.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum may experience improved efficiency, making it more appealing to a wider user base and enabling a broader array of applications.\n\nHowever, the success of these changes depends on community adoption and effective implementation.\n\nHow is Ethereum doing?\n\nComing to the state of the protocol, it was seen that the gas usage on the network has remained consistent. This meant activity on the network was high.\n\nHowever, the number of NFT trades occurring on the Ethereum network has fallen.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThis could have a negative impact on Ethereum in the future as NFT trades make up a large amount of the overall activity on the network.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $2,361.39 and its price had fallen by -1.21% in the last 24 hours.

        "content": "In a popular blog post titled \u2018Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,\u2019 Ethereum Founder, Vitalik Buterin, says the vision of a decentralized internet is being eclipsed by the challenging reality of rising transaction fees on blockchain networks.\n\nAccording to Buterin, the initial vision of cryptocurrency assets as a democratizing force in finance appears to be waning, with practical, everyday use cases becoming more theoretical than realized in practice. Buterin points out that discussions about \u2018consumer crypto payments\u2019 have noticeably dwindled.\n\nThese escalating fees are erecting a barrier to entry, impeding innovation, and hindering the widespread adoption of cryptocurrency as a medium for transactions and saving.\n\nThey have marginalized nearly all users except the most speculative and risk-tolerant individuals, colloquially referred to as \u2018degen gamblers.\u2019 These individuals are characterized as the only audience still willing to bear the high fees for transaction.\n\n\u201cBut when transaction fees go to over $100, as they have during the peak of the bull markets, there is exactly one audience that remains willing to play \u2013 and in fact, because coin prices are going up and they\u2019re getting richer, becomes even more willing to play: degen gamblers,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\n\u201cDegen gamblers can be okay in moderate doses, and I have talked to plenty of people at events who were motivated to join crypto for the money but stayed for the ideals. But when they are the largest group using the chain on a large scale, this adjusts the public perception and the crypto space\u2019s internal culture, and leads to many of the other negatives that we have seen play out over the last few years.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Buterin advocates for introspection and proactive measures within the community. He emphasizes the necessity for scalable solutions that reduce barriers and revive the initial inclusive vision of Web3. This challenge extends beyond technical considerations, encompassing cultural shifts that demand a return to the foundational principles that initially made the concept of decentralized digital currency appealing to a wide audience. As for Ethereum, which has been accused of ceding its decentralization to centralized staking pools, Buterin noted various positives in 2023, including rollups, account abstraction, and Zero Knowledge Proofs which have become more common. These are some of the technologies that can help \u2018take things in a different direction going forward.\u2019 Follow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates Join and interact with our Telegram community _________________________________________ _________________________________________"

        "content": "BTC\u2019s and ETH\u2019s price action this year was one of the best of the century.\n\nBTC displayed weakness, suggesting a decline below $43,000 while ETH may move toward $2,500.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s [BTC] and Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] performances in 2023 would go down as one of the best-ever in the century, a post by Santiment disclosed. At press time, BTC had been able to reclaim $43,000. ETH, on the other end, skyrocketed and changed hands at $2,380.\n\nThe crypto analysis tool, in its post, also mentioned that ETH and BTC possess the ability to reach their highest values before the year ends.\n\n\ud83e\udd73\ud83d\udcca 2023 is going down in the books as one of the best performing years of the century, accounting for multiple major sectors. #Bitcoin and #Ethereum are still within reach of breaking 1.5+ year highs, which were just established 3 weeks ago. https://t.co/JxbW5vU5Iy pic.twitter.com/aLSGX5U2Vv \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 27, 2023\n\nAfter the glimmer, comes the party\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the crypto market was struggling to recover from the FTX collapse that plunged prices. During that time, BTC\u2019s value was less than $17,000 while ETH traded a little above $1,200.\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum was fueled by different reasons.\n\nBut around the first quarter (Q1), the major reason was the collapse of some top traditional institutions in the U.S. The crash of the banks at that time triggered distrust in the institutions.\n\nIn turn, the crypto market led by Ethereum and Bitcoin gained from the liquidity withdrawn as it also affected prices in a good way.\n\nWhile there were other reasons for the continuous price hike, the notable influence that has kept both coins on the green side is the optimism around a potential spot ETF. For most of the year, several firms have applied for either an Ethereum or Bitcoin ETF. In a few cases, some firms applied for both.\n\nThese applications, despite being delayed by the U.S. SEC influenced investment inflows. On many occasions, AMBCrypto disclosed hikes in money flowing into investment products connected to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe inflows indicated that several institutions were confident in the short and long-term performance of the cryptocurrencies. So, it was not surprising that BTC put a 159% Year-To-Date (YTD) increase.\n\nETH also followed by climbing by 98%. Going into the last few days, there are predictions that the coins may finish the year even better.\n\nBulls and bears to hustle for the grand prize\n\nFor Bitcoin, the daily chart showed that there was strong support at $42,279. However, the support at the level was not a confirmation of a bullish trend.\n\nAMBCrypto evaluated the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) which was negative.\n\nThe negative MACD indicated increasing downward momentum. Further, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) confirmed the bias as the reading fell to 54.52. If this trend continues, Bitcoin might end the year below $43,000.\n\nHowever, the chart above also shows the On Balance Volume (OBV) which was rising. The rising OBV reflects positive volume pressure which could lead to higher prices.\n\nIf buying pressure increases just before the year ends, BTC might hit $45,000. If not, a downward move below $43,000 could be its next target.\n\nMeanwhile, the ETH/USD 4-hour chart mirrored a bullish structure. On the 27th of December, ETH had surpassed the $2,290 resistance. But the coin price faced a swift rejection after it hit $2,415, suggesting that there was a cluster of accumulation at the level.\n\nThough volatility increased, the upper band of the Bollinger Bands (BB) hit the ETH price. This suggests that the altcoin was overbought and the price may retrace further. But on looking at the Directional Movement Index (DMI), the story was different.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nAt press time, the +DMI (green) was 33.92 while the -DMI (red) was 16.35. This position implied that ETH\u2019s bullish tendencies remained pressure.\n\nShould the Average Directional Index (ADX), colored yellow, remain above 25 while the +DMI tops the -DMI, then ETH may retest $2,415 or jump to $2,500 before the year closes."

        "content": "Fri 29 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fitah\n\nEthereum, the renowned cryptocurrency designed by Vitalik Buterin, continues to astonish the financial world with its robustness and the ability to confound bearish forecasts. It has achieved a 100% performance this year.\n\nThe Remarkable Rise of Ethereum\n\nRecently, Ethereum has shown remarkable resilience, overturning last year\u2019s bearish predictions. To everyone\u2019s surprise, Ethereum has not just withstood the downward trend, but has also recorded an increase of more than 100% this year. Presently, the price of ETH is on track to reach $2,500. This performance contradicts earlier predictions that forecasted a drop to $500.\n\nThe analysis was conducted by Mags, followed by over 48,000 subscribers on X (Twitter), who made this assessment. He indeed evaluated the current rise of Ethereum in comparison with last year\u2019s.\n\n#ETH\n\n\n\nA year ago, some people told you to sell your ETH, claiming it would return to its home at $500, which never happened.\n\n\n\nA year later #Ethereum just tested $2450 and is going far from home and might never go back to home again..\n\n\n\n$3000 soon \ud83e\udd1d pic.twitter.com/nCBurj5nBt \u2014 Mags (@thescalpingpro) December 28, 2023\n\nIn his analysis, he predicts that ETH will soon reach $3,000 as part of the current rise. This isn\u2019t just speculative prediction but a projection based on market dynamics. Ethereum is indeed experiencing a wave of positive sentiment, influenced by factors such as the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies. There is also the rise of DeFi platforms and broader acceptance of blockchain technology.\n\nWill the Surge Continue Over Time?\n\nThe current meteoric rise of ETH is built on solid foundations.\n\nFirst of all, there is the continuous development of DApps and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This has indeed increased its utility and relevance. Moreover, Ethereum\u2019s pivotal role in the development of the emerging NFT market has added extra value to the platform.\n\nFurthermore, the burgeoning adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in modern finance has played a key role in Ethereum\u2019s positive performance. With the growing interest from institutions in digital assets, including ETFs, Ethereum, which is second in terms of market capitalization, continues to enjoy increased recognition and investments.\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains the market leader, Ethereum is not far behind. With its current performance, Ethereum is positioning itself as a serious contender for the throne, thus becoming a formidable rival against the queen of cryptos. Ether is no longer a secondary player but a major protagonist amongst the Altcoins.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Ethereum Price Pumps Above $2,300 While Meme Kombat Blasts Past $5m as Meme Coin Whales Buy Big\n\nFriday, December 28th, 2023 \u2013 Altcoins like Ethereum are hotting up and Meme Kombat is joining the party too, after raising more than $5 million to pass the 50% milestone in its ICO. As the new meme coin enters the latter half of its presale its fundraising run rate is accelerating as whales pile in.\n\nMeme coins remain one of the most popular segments in crypto, providing traders with the chance to snare gains that can often be measured in the thousands of percent. Meme Kombat is well-positioned to be among the big hitters when it launches. The token has a $10m hard cap target.\n\nAmong the meme coin heavyweights that Meme Kombat aspires to emulate are the likes of Pepe and Shiba with their multi-billion dollar market capitalizations.\n\nBut in the meme coin space, even more so than elsewhere in crypto, new coins are being launched every day in a hyper-competitive market. Pawswap (+225%) and Baby Grok (+75%) and Spurdo (+85%) are just three of the coins that have been setting the pace for meme coins over the past seven days, for example.\n\nAcross crypto as a whole, buyers are back in the driving seat as the expected approval of a spot bitcoin ETF fuels a new bull run for the industry. Bitcoin is the best-performing financial asset of 2023 and altcoins are beginning to catch up.\n\nMeanwhile, the ETH price was nearly 10% higher yesterday, blasting past $2,400. Earlier in the week it was the turn of Ethereum competitor Solana to lead the pack, at one stage chalking up a daily gain of 20%.\n\nHelping to propel Solana higher was the remarkable rise of BONK, a meme coin that runs on its blockchain. It is no surprise then, as meme coin fever continues, that Ethereum-powered Meme Kombat has raised $5 million in double-quick time.\n\nWe hit $5 million raised in the $MK presale\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude80 Congrats fighters! pic.twitter.com/SK5TGEuson \u2014 Meme Kombat (@Meme_Kombat) December 28, 2023\n\nWhale buys $83,845 worth of Meme Kombat ($MK)\n\n\n\nAgainst this favorable backdrop for cryptocurrencies, and meme coins in particular, Meme Kombat has a lot going for it because of its gaming attributes and passive income potential from staking.\n\nIn the past few hours alone, whales have been stepping up to the plate to buy at scale. One wallet address bought $83,000 worth of $MK:\n\n4 hours until the price of $MK goes up to $0.268\u23f0 In the meantime, take a look at these MAJOR buys that came in over the last day\ud83e\udd29 One was a whopping $84k and the other $20k\ud83c\udf89 pic.twitter.com/tsGsvuPujG \u2014 Meme Kombat (@Meme_Kombat) December 28, 2023\n\nMeme Kombat brings together all the top meme coins in a battling arena where players bet on the outcome of the bouts. Its unique design means it has appeal across the meme coin space, regardless of which of the coins a user might actually hold.\n\nAltcoin season is hotting up and meme coins like Meme Kombat continue to be all the rage. $MK token is just about to enter Stage 9 in which it will be priced at $0.268. In a week\u2019s time, on January 4 the price rises to $0.272. It means there will only be a week to go to grab the lowest price available \u2013 and then it is the final price in presale until the hard cap is reached.\n\nThere is a strong chance that the current price stage will sell out before the one-week window closes, so there\u2019s no time to lose to conduct due diligence before deciding to buy.\n\nPEPE is up 4,888% since April, but GameFi coin Meme Kombat ($MK) can do even better\n\n\n\nSince April 2023 when it was trading at its all-time low (it launched that month), $PEPE has risen in price by 4,888%. According to Coinmarketcap data $PEPE has a market cap of $577 million. DEXTools shows token holders at 154k on decentralized exchanges in a testament to the popularity of the frog coin.\n\nMeme Kombat shows every sign of having the same potential as $PEPE, although it resides on the Ethereum blockchain. Because it will host battles featuring all the top meme coins, it will appeal to market participants across the meme coin space, whichever coin they might be invested in.\n\nMeme coins continue to act as a magnet for traders seeking to pocket large alpha returns, but the space has matured beyond just chasing short-term price movements.\n\nIncreasingly, traders are hunting for coins that have a use case that could scale and deliver profits. Meme Kombat is just such a coin.\n\nThe project is building an Arena in which meme characters battle and players bet on the outcomes. As such, Meme Kombat encompasses the revenue-generating potential of two of the fastest-growing sectors in crypto outside of meme coins \u2013 gaming and betting.\n\nAccording to crypto data site CoinGecko, GameFi has a market cap of $20.6 billion while gambling tokens are valued at $796 million and growing. CoinGecko values the meme coins sector at an impressive $23.7 billion. Meme Kombat is perfectly positioned to pitch into this expanding total addressable market of $45 billion.\n\nWhat is so exciting about the Meme Kombat market fit is the way in which its battling meme characters and betting business model is able to appeal to the existing communities coalescing around the most high-profile meme coins.\n\nAll of those communities will have an interest in how their favored meme coin fares in the Meme Kombat Arena. Many will want to partake of the fun and profits to be had from involvement in the ecosystem.\n\nMeme Kombat\u2019s Season 1 will be available after the presale is sold out and the project launched. There are 11 meme characters you can battle with in Season 1: Milady, Baby Doge, Doge, Floki, Kishu, Mong, Pepe, Pepe2, Shiba, Sponge and Wojak.\n\nSeason 2 meme characters will be out just before Season 1 wraps up.\n\nMeme Kombat presale buyers can stake to earn 184% APY\n\n\n\nAnd there is no need to wait for the platform to go live before putting your money to work with Meme Kombat ($MK). If you invest in the ICO today, you can immediately stake your token to earn an annual percentage yield that is currently sitting at 184%.\n\nWhen the battling and betting system is turned on, stakers will be able to bet while earning APY at the same time. Three-quarters of sold $MK is now staked, providing buyers will the comfort of knowing that sell pressure will be dampened over the short term. Stakers must hold their tokens for a minimum of seven days after the launch of the coin.\n\n$MK dynamic staking combines on-chain and off-chain transactions, so users only pay network fees when they stake and unstake their $MK while claiming rewards takes place off-chain, incurring no fees.\n\nAll staking interactions are logged in real-time, plus the staking system will be integrated with the game, allowing platform users to easily choose between staking tokens or using them for battles..\n\nThe number of stakers is powering ahead as interest in the coin explodes. At present, 21.3 million $MK has been staked, up from 13.8 million on December 14. Total rewards of 4,104,400 $MK have accrued to the 6,189 stakers.\n\nWorth bearing in mind for buyers is the fact that 76% of sold coins have been staked, which means there will be much less selling pressure when it launches on exchanges than is typically the case for newly listed tokens.\n\nExperts predict Meme Kombat ($MK) price to 10x at launch\n\n\n\nYouTube crypto analysts have spotted the ripening opportunity that is Meme Kombat. ClayBro, who has 116k subscribers to his channel describes Meme Kombat as what could be the \u201cbiggest meme coin gaming token of 2024\u201d.\n\nMatthew Perry tells his 200k-plus subscribers that it could be the 10x coin they have been looking for.\n\nJacob Crypto Bury is of like mind, predicting possible 10x returns for early investors in the project meme coin gaming project.\n\nMeme Kombat total token supply is 120,000,000, of which thirty percent is allocated for staking and battle rewards, 10% for community rewards, and 10% for decentralized exchange liquidity. Fifty percent of the total token supply is on sale in the ICO.\n\nProspective investors can rest assured because the Meme Kombat smart contract is fully security audited and no major issues have been detected, so you can buy with confidence.\n\nIn the final analysis, meme coins live and die by the strength of the communities that they can build. Success can depend on subjective elements such as the humor and the artwork a project creates.\n\nBut Meme Kombat has the advantage of riding on the coattails of the popularity of the coins that will feature in its games, so it has plenty of strings to its bow.\n\nStill, on artwork and humor alone, Meme Kombat knocks it out of the park. Ultimately, its strong utility value as a battling arena that blends gambling and gaming is the clincher.\n\nDon\u2019t let Meme Kombat slip through your fingers \u2013 it could be the crypto gem of 2024."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Shows Signs of Recovery; Cardano (ADA) & InQubeta (QUBE) Drive Altcoin Surge - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) is showcasing resilience, exhibiting signs of a potential recovery. Concurrently, two top altcoins, Cardano (ADA) and InQubeta (QUBE), drive a notable surge in the altcoin market.\n\nAs Ethereum charts a path of revival, the spotlight on Cardano\u2019s remarkable growth sets the stage for what promises to be an intriguing narrative. Yet, it is the transformative potential of InQubeta that steals the show, emerging as a promising altcoin poised for significance in 2024.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Network Activity and Bullish Outlook\n\nRecent data presented by Martinez reveals that new Ethereum addresses have been rising. This surge in network activity suggests a renewed interest in accumulating Ethereum, hinting at a potential uptick in the asset\u2019s price. Despite some FUD circulating within the Ethereum community, particularly from figures like Peter Brandt, the growing network activity provides optimism for ETH\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\nExamining the charts, the number of new addresses entering the Ethereum network has reached its highest level since October 16. This surge aligns with efforts from ETH bulls to revitalize the coin\u2019s price after weeks of range-bound motion. As Ethereum retests its breakout zone, the network\u2019s increasing activity could pave the way for a resumption of the coin\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\nCardano (ADA) & InQubeta (QUBE) Drive Altcoin Surge\n\nIn the vast realm of the best altcoins, two notable players, Cardano (ADA) and InQubeta (QUBE), are at the forefront of driving a surge in the market. While Cardano boasts a remarkable 150% growth in the past three months, the spotlight is on InQubeta, positioning itself as one of the best altcoins to buy for 2024.\n\nCardano (ADA): A Proof-of-Stake Powerhouse\n\nCardano (ADA) has quietly achieved a remarkable 150% growth in the past three months. Cardano stands out as a compelling altcoin as a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nThe surge experienced by Cardano is attributed to growing demand, increased institutional acceptance, and an overall improvement in market sentiment. Positioned as one of the best cryptos to invest in, Cardano offers enormous upside potential while maintaining a reasonably priced entry point.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): Transforming AI Funding\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) has gained the attention of many heavyweight investors by achieving over 150% growth in its presale. This innovative project aims to revolutionize the AI market, which is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2030. Leveraging blockchain technology, InQubeta seeks to reshape the fundraising landscape for AI startups, providing investment opportunities through trending NFTs and with the use of its native token, QUBE.\n\nThe token\u2019s impressive journey, from a humble $0.007 during beta to its current stage at $0.01925, underscores the enthusiasm surrounding InQubeta. As the first crowdfunding crypto for beginners and AI startups, it offers investors a chance to participate in the rapidly growing AI market through NFT fractionalization.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s mission is to make the AI market accessible to a broader investor base, allowing startups to secure capital through crypto. With experts predicting a potential 55x increase after launch, InQubeta (QUBE) emerges as one of the best altcoins to invest in, offering growth potential and the opportunity to reshape the future of AI funding.\n\nConclusion: A Diverse Altcoin Landscape\n\nIn the world of the best alt coins, Ethereum\u2019s signs of recovery set a positive tone for the market. Cardano\u2019s impressive growth complements the altcoin surge. However, InQubeta (QUBE) took an extra leap, standing out as a promising altcoin with transformative potential in AI funding.\n\nTo explore these opportunities further, consider visiting InQubeta\u2019s website and joining the vibrant community on Twitter. As the altcoin landscape evolves, stay informed and embrace its diversity.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

The score of 100 in search interest represents peak popularity for the term.\n\nThe spike has been primarily led by the recent popular memecoin BONK, which gained massively from November to its peak in mid-December. The unexpected surge in SOL price has also continued to raise search interest for Solana during the past couple of weeks.\n\nGoogle Trends data further shows that people who searched for Solana on Google have also searched for BONK and Tensor, a Solana-based NFT marketplace.\n\nSolana has regained much attention in the past three months, with the SOL price rising from nearly $21 on October 1 to peaking over $124 on December 25, recording a gain of over 490% during the period.\n\nSOL is currently trading at $108 with a yearly gain of 1050%, according to data from Coinmarketcap."

On December 16, the network reached an all-time high in transactions, coinciding with the launch of its sync inscription. Data from on-chain analytics firm Dune reveals that 4.6 million inscriptions were minted on zkSync that day, fueling a record-breaking 5.3 million transactions.\n\nThe high number of transactions led to network congestion on the same day. A similar incident happened on December 24 when the zkSync developer team announced a temporary shutdown due to another inscription-related spike.\n\nzkSync Era is currently encountering network issues. Teams are actively addressing the situation and are committed to resolving it as swiftly as possible. We will share a post-mortem report once the issue has been fully addressed and analyzed.

This phenomenon isn\u2019t unique to zkSync, as other top chains like Arbitrum, Polygon, and The Open Network (TON) have faced similar problems when dealing with surges in activity."

In comparison, the bigger smart contracts network Ethereum [ETH] could only clock 135,000 transactions.\n\nCrypto swap, as is well known, allows one to instantly trade one cryptocurrency for another, without the involvement of any crypto-to-fiat exchange. It has evolved into one of the most critical indicators of a protocol\u2019s DeFi growth.\n\nSolana\u2019s high number of swaps reflected increased confidence and demand for its DeFi protocols, including decentralized exchanges (DEXes).\n\nA peek at Solana\u2019s DEX growth\n\nOver the last week, Solana-based DEXes logged trades worth $10.74 billion, according to AMBCrypto\u2019s examination of DeFiLlama\u2019s data. With this, it outperformed even the likes of Ethereum, which executed $9.42 billion in trades.\n\nIn fact, December has turned out to be the most prolific month for Solana\u2019s DEX activity. Since the start of the month, more than $24 billion have been settled as of this writing, a phenomenal threefold increase over the previous month.\n\nAside from the frenzy on its DEXes, the network saw a significant increase in the USD value of cryptos locked on its DeFi projects.\n\nOver the last month, Solana\u2019s total value locked (TVL) has more than doubled to $2.19 billion at press time. In fact, Solana had the fastest monthly growth rate among the top ten networks.\n\nAs obvious, the jump was primarily driven by SOL\u2019s rally at the price charts. However, the SOL-denominated TVL also witnessed an increase of 5.6% over the week.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nSOL retraces as traders lock in gains\n\nSOL witnessed a sharp pullback in the last 24 hours as impatient traders decided to profit-take. This retracement caused SOL\u2019s market cap to decline, pushing it to the fifth position, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nHowever, on zooming out, it was all green. SOL added gains of 87% over the last month and nearly 11x times more than what it was at the beginning of the year."

        "content": "A major crypto analyst with over 700,000 followers recently made a bullish outlook surrounding the future of Ethereum (ETH), which can result in a major price upswing during the upcoming months.\n\nFueled by the Ethereum ETFs that are set to come next year, if approved, this could boost the crypto to astronomical levels. Despite this, Meme Moguls (MGLS) has also captured a significant level of attention with the performance of its presale. Today, we will look at both of these projects to see just which is the best crypto to invest in.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) to Experience Major Rally Following Its Launch\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) will launch an innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) platform that will change how users access gaming experiences, as it is mixed with real-world economics.\n\nUsers can dive into different games and competitions to climb the leaderboards and earn more. The project is undergoing its blockchain ICO and has already attracted significant attention.\n\nMoguls World is the dedicated Metaverse available in the ecosystem. In it, players can mine tokens and even join liquidity pools.\n\nEach player can begin with $100,000 in virtual currency and create a portfolio to complete the challenges and turn their profits into real cashable returns. Community members can also set up tournaments on top of the platform and can become eligible for rewards based on their share of the pool and the annual percentage returns.\n\nMGLS is the native crypto behind the project, and it\u2019s used as the in-game currency and governance tokens that add tangible value to the ecosystem. The project will let users compete in virtual stock market trading games.\n\nDuring Stage 3, MGLS is offered at $0.0025, and fueled by the vast utility of the ecosystem, analysts project an upswing of 100x upon its launch and listing on major Tier-1 exchanges.\n\nEthereum (ETH) to Reach Over $4,000 in 2024 Following ETF Approval\n\nEthereum (ETH) is rising, and it\u2019s pushed by a catalyst that typically takes a backseat to the market narrative set by Bitcoin. A popular pseudonymous analyst, Pentoshi, shared insights on X (Twitter), highlighting the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs in the upcoming 12 months. According to the analyst, This could surge the ETH crypto\u2019s value by over 50%.\n\nDuring the past week, ETH moved up in value from $2,143 to $2,335. This marked a total weekly increase of 7.4% and an annual increase of 87.8%. According to the Ethereum price prediction, it can climb as far as $4,031.01 in 2024.\n\nPentoshi\u2019s optimism resonates with different analysts as well, including Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, who foresees a promising 12 months for the ETH crypto.\n\nSummary\n\nWhile Ethereum is bullish, another crypto is picking up significant attention. The blockchain ICO of Meme Moguls has been a major point of appeal.\n\nWith its unique blend of meme-inspired assets, P2E gaming, and real-world economics, it can help traders improve their strategies and monetize their time in the process. All of these aspects make it the best crypto to invest in today.\n\nLearn more about the $MGLS here:\n\nVisit Meme Moguls | Join the Community\n\nDisclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the content provider and do not necessarily represent those of Crypto Reporter.

        "content": "The Solana price growth for the past few months seems to have hit a barrier just above the $120 price level. The price of Solana (SOL) fell around 8% on Thursday to about $98, showing the sheer volatile nature of the crypto market.\n\nAs a result, Solana slipped below BNB in market cap rankings, as the latter rallied 9% to take back the fourth spot. According to on-chain data, there\u2019s been an increase in transfers of what looks like profit-taking from Solana whales.\n\nLarge Whale Sells $38.2 Million in SOL Tokens\n\nWhen whales move a lot of crypto, they can really shake things up. According to Lookonchain, an anonymous investor deposited 303,756 SOL tokens worth approximately $38.2 million on Binance, possibly as part of a selloff. Further details show this particular whale has made strategic SOL trades in the past, making huge profits.\n\nThe whale withdrew 19,704 SOL from Binance on Sept 29. Solana was trading at $20 during this time, making the transfer worth approximately $394,000. The whale would then deposit it into Binance at $43 per token on Nov 8, making $453,000, a 115% profit. Data from Lookonchain shows that the address still has 119,998 SOL tokens worth $12.44 million staked, and is sitting on over $17 million unrealized profit.\n\nA whale deposited 303,756 $SOL($32.8M) to #Binance today, possibly selling it for profit. The whale withdrew 423,754 $SOL($28.18M) at $66.5 from #Binance in the past 1 month. And still has 119,998 $SOL ($12.44M) staked, the profit exceeding $17M! This whale also withdrew\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Sptfj7uUIa \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 28, 2023\n\nSpeculation that other large holders of SOL, known as \u201cwhales,\u201d sold off portions of their holdings recently may have contributed to the recent price dip. Similar social media posts from whale transaction tracker whale alerts have shown various large SOL transfers from private wallets into crypto exchanges on Thursday, suggesting whales locking in profits or reducing their exposure to the token.\n\nTwo of the most notable transactions were the transfer of 1,832,958 SOL worth $182.9 million from an unknown wallet to Coinbase and the transfer of 114,046 SOL worth $11.5 million from another private wallet to Coinbase.\n\nTrading data also suggests traders were moving funds out of SOL to stablecoins. As a result, Solana\u2019s price cascaded and fell from $110 to $98 in 24 hours.\n\nSOL price recovers to $107 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nCurrent State Of Solana\n\nThe SOL community and ecosystem have witnessed one of the best price growth this year. Over the past 24 hours, around $18.6 million worth of Solana positions were liquidated, with $10.42 million coming from leveraged long positions, data from CoinGlass shows. This profit-taking sentiment seems to have rolled over into BONK, Solana\u2019s first dog-themed meme token, which is now 50% down from its all-time high.\n\nSolana has since recovered some of the loss, and is now trading at $108, showing the crypto hasn\u2019t lost all of its bullish momentum. Solana recently reached a yearly high of $123.76 on December 25, its highest point in 20 months.\n\nFeatured image from CNBC, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

It should also be noted that CIC Digital LLC, like The Trump Organization and Donald J. Trump himself, could be the manager of NFT INT LLC, the company that handles the promotion of Trump\u2019s digital collectible cards.\n\nHowever, on his official website, one can read the following:\n\n\u201cNFT INT LLC uses the name, likeness, and image of Donald J.

        "content": "Fri 29 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nWith its SOL token back well above 100 dollars, Solana marks a resounding comeback and positions itself as a formidable opponent to Ethereum\u2019s dominance. Let\u2019s dissect the mechanisms of this resurgence.\n\nDoes Solana\u2019s Shadow Loom Over the Realm of Ethereum?\n\nLaunched in 2020, Solana bets everything on speed. Its blockchain can process 65,000 transactions per second, compared to a mere 15 for Ethereum. A considerable advantage for attracting decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn 2021, this argument captivated the masses. SOL surged spectacularly, from $1 in January to $260 in November. Its proponents even announced that Solana was on track to overtake Ethereum in the smart contracts market.\n\nHowever, the FTX debacle changed the game. The crash of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2018s platform, closely linked to Solana, sent SOL below $10. The blockchain also faced criticism for its technical vulnerabilities. Its future seemed uncertain.\n\nA Spectacular Comeback\n\nYet, the tide began to turn at the start of 2023. SOL rebounded sharply to $20 after the FTX collapse, and then surpassed $100 in mid-February.\n\nSeveral factors explain this rebound. On one hand, investors are returning to cryptocurrencies after difficult months. On the other hand, new projects are emerging on Solana, attracted by its low transaction fees.\n\nTrading volumes are surging, fueled by risky speculation. Last weekend, Solana even overtook Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of spot transaction volume in SOL/USDT, reaching an impressive $1.037 billion on Binance.\n\nDoes this spectacular comeback mean that Solana is threatening the dominance of Ethereum? Not yet. With 29 billion dollars of assets locked, Vitalik Buterin\u2018s blockchain remains well ahead. Solana is worth 15 times less, at 1.5 billion according to data from DefiLlama, despite its rapid growth.\n\nNevertheless, this contender poses a serious threat. Solana continues to attract projects thanks to its low fees and record speed. If it overcomes its stability issues, it could continue to gain market share from Ethereum in the coming years. Their rivalry promises to be thrilling.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program! Earn points for each article you read and gain access to exclusive rewards.

PancakeSwap V3 embodies a more innovative decentralized exchange protocol than V2.\n\n?BNB Chain and Ethereum just hit ATH in monthly trading volumes since v3 dropped, expect more ATH in 2024. ?https://t.co/hVD4mSBUDC pic.twitter.com/VBEvfPftfk \u2014 PancakeSwap?Everyone's Favorite DEX (@PancakeSwap) December 29, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSome of the important upgrades made to the PancakeSwap V3 engine are the speed and cost of transactions as well as maximizing fee returns for Liquidity Pool (LP) providers.\n\nThe BNB Chain and Ethereum trading volume milestones prove how well both LP providers and users generally use the trading platform.\n\nThe BNB Chain and Ethereum Performance Data\n\nAccording to the PancakeSwap V3 info page, the TVL of the BNB Chain protocol comes in at $299.32 million, while the trading volume from December 1 to 29 is $7.67 billion.\n\nNotably, Wrapped BNB (WBNB) has the biggest 24-hour trading volume, worth $436.26 million, with the top 3 slots also involving Tether (USDT) at a volume of $423.92 million, and PancakeSwap Token (CAKE) at $48.63 million.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe figures on record for the Ethereum protocol are relatively smaller but still quite impressive. The TVL comes in at $58.58 million, while the monthly trading volume sits at $737.95 million.\n\nWrapped Ethereum (WETH) is the token with the biggest liquidity on the PancakeSwap-based ETH chain, while Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) make up the top 3 most embraced tokens.\n\nPancakeSwap Setting Stage for More Embrace\n\nIn an industry where competition blares hot, PancakeSwap has been making one crucial move to make its ecosystem as attractive as possible through its burn CAKE burn program.\n\nAs reported earlier by The Crypto Basic, PancakeSwap has unveiled its plans to reduce its native token\u2019s supply from 750 million to 450 million, a move that could spark more massive growth for CAKE as demand might, in the long term, exceed supply.\n\nThis CAKE burn revelation complements the other related efforts that the decentralized trading platform has been implementing over time. Overall, the attractiveness of CAKE is a good catalyst that may draw more users into the PancakeSwap ecosystem."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, an address allegedly associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly dumped $2.4 million worth of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAccording to a tweet from crypto analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, the transaction records disclose that about three weeks ago, Donald Trump commenced the transfer of Ethereum (ETH) to Coinbase. This action came on the heels of months of accumulating royalties from NFTs associated with the former president. The analysts at the firm observed that the wallet linked to Trump had amassed a peak balance of $4 million before the recent divestment, involving the liquidation of an estimated 1075 ETH.\n\nArkham researchers further provided insights into the transaction, shedding light on Trump\u2019s involvement in distributing and promoting non-fungible tokens. Reportedly, the NFTs associated with the politician are managed by NFT INT LLC, an entity explicitly stated as \u201cnot owned, operated or controlled\u201d by Trump or his organizations. The project description emphasizes that NFT INT holds a paid license from CIC Digital LLC, which could be subject to termination or withdrawal based on its terms.\n\nCIC Digital, where Trump holds positions as the manager, president, secretary, and treasurer, owns the wallet, receiving commissions from the \u201clicense transaction.\u201d This revelation raises questions about the financial dynamics and relationships within the Trump-associated entities involved in the NFT market.\n\nMeanwhile, a report in August disclosed that the former president declared an income of $2.8 million from the sale of Ethereum. The report further detailed the success of Trump\u2019s NFT ventures, with the first series of trading cards bringing in revenue ranging from $100,001 to $1 million. The subsequent set of non-fungible tokens quickly sold out within ten minutes, generating an impressive $500,000 to $1 million in revenue. Each asset\u2019s initial price was $99, demonstrating the widespread appeal and profitability of Trump-associated NFTs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this month, Trump released yet another collection of NFTs featuring his prison photo, continuing his engagement with the burgeoning NFT market.\n\nThat said, as the specifics of these transactions gradually come to light, the cryptocurrency community finds itself engrossed in the financial strategies of the former U.S. president within the dynamic world of digital assets. Despite Trump\u2019s engagement with cryptocurrencies, he has refrained from publicly endorsing the sector.\n\nIt is worth recalling that in December 2021, former U.S. First Lady Melania Trump made a notable entry into the NFT space by launching her platform and revealing her inaugural digital artwork, powered by the Solana blockchain."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) were subject to some major whale transactions, Whale Alert disclosed. According to the whale tracking handle, 1,335 BTC was transferred from Coinbase to an unknown wallet on December 30.\n\nWhale Alert @whale_alert \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 1,335 #BTC (56,252,449 USD) transferred from #Coinbase to unknown wallethttps://t.co/0XEFmMZAaX\n\nBut that was not the only transaction involving Bitcoin. A few hours before the above transfer, another whale sent 3,144 BTC to Coinbase.\n\nThese two transactions implied that both whales involved were on opposite sides of the divide. While the first one plans to hold, the latter transfer suggests a sell-off. However, it was a different case for ETH.\n\nAround the same period, $33.50 million worth of ETH was transferred into the Coinbase exchange. There was another 9,991 ETH moved into the same exchange hours before the latest one.\n\nWhale Alert @whale_alert \ud83d\udea8 9,991 #ETH (23,043,351 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/dDSXRNMJOu\n\nAn ETH Dump Ahead?\n\nEarlier, Coin Edition reported about an ETH breakout which led the altcoin price above $2,400. The ETH/USD 4-hour chart displayed a bullish structure until December 27. However, the past two days have seen the altcoin confined between $2,292 and $2,379.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) also showed that the initial price uptrend had weakened. The decreasing reading of the RSI suggests a bearish momentum. If not curtailed, it could lead to a decline below 2,300.\n\nMeanwhile, the RSI had formed higher lows while ETH\u2019s price formed lower highs, indicating a bullish divergence. This disparity implied that a reversal to the upside could be near.\n\nCoin Edition\n\nIf this remains the case, then ETH\u2019s potential decline might be short-lived. Also, a move toward $2,500 could be next for the coin.\n\nBTC Nears $40,000\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price action over the last few days has been contrary to the optimism in the market about a potential ETF approval. At press time, the price had dropped below $42,000.\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, the MACD showed that the coin\u2019s momentum was bearish. This position made it clear that a drop toward $40,000 could be expected.\n\nOn the contrary, if there is an increase in accumulation, a bullish breakout toward $45,000 could be next.\n\nCoin Edition\n\nHowever, the Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) indicator revealed that accumulation has not significantly increased over the last few days. Should this indicator continue to hover around the same zone, then BTC\u2019s dip might be unavoidable.\n\nIn the short term, ETH and BTC would most likely experience slight price decreases. However, this does not invalidate a bullish thesis in the foreseeable future."

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nWith values continuously changing and new projects being born, the cryptocurrency market has been inhaling people's investment. This analysis will alert readers to recent news about Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH), two coins making noise in the crypto space, NFTs and other parts of the market. Moreover, we will cast our eyes on Pushd, a new entrant that could change the structure of online marketplaces via blockchain technology.\n\nPushd (PUSHD): Turning Online Marketplaces Upside Down via Blockchain Innovation\n\nPushd will be the world's first decentralized online marketplace built on blockchain technology and rewrite the online trading rules by placing security, openness and decentralized management at the forefront. Pushd, in particular, sticks out due to its innovative idea in the online selling market. From the perspective of tokenomics, Pushd will lock up tokens assigned to the team for 700 days and have limited the total supply to 250,000,000. For just $0.01 during presale stage one, Pushd offers investors an attractive investment opportunity and a unique reward program for participating in different tasks and achieving different milestones, whereby those who invest in its presale will receive a share of the revenue generated from the marketplace. The platform will also enable coin swapping at 0% commission charges. Seasoned investors have caught onto the potential of alternative cryptocurrencies and considered Pushd an exciting choice, vying for the title of the fastest-growing future Blue Chip in the crypto space.\n\n>>> JOIN THE PRESALE <<<\n\nSolana (SOL): Ascending Beyond $100\n\nSOL, as the native utility token on the Solana (SOL) blockchain network, has recently broken through the $100 barrier, currently trading at $108.27. This represents breathtakingly impressive growth when you tweak some of that metaphorical yarn to see how much value Solana (SOL) as a digital asset gemstone has clocked up over the last year and a half since its creation. Its value ballooned 70% in December alone. Solana (SOL)'s rising value is unrelated to a period of feverish trading activity, which has thrust the Solana (SOL) blockchain into front and center stage on-chain temporarily.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Treading toward $2,500 with Caution\n\nThe leading player in smart contract platforms, Ethereum (ETH) was under much scrutiny this week as it was very near to reaching the $2,500 price milestone. According to chart analysis, Ethereum (ETH) will achieve this mark by mid-January 2024. But be warned: The gap is widening between Ethereum's (ETH) 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Therefore, investors worry that this gap might be corrected. The decline in volume that has accompanied some of the most recent Ethereum (ETH) rallies gives an extra reason for Caution, hinting at a future pullback. These indicators can significantly impact Ethereum (ETH)'s future course, so investors are encouraged to watch for trends. Looking at a long term investment with the greatest gains we believe Pushd well outweighs Ethereum (ETH).\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200bPUSHD WEBSITE PUSHD PRESALE PLATFORM\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Blames Rising Transaction Fees for Web3\u2019s Drift from Decentralization\n\nIn a recent blog post titled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,\u201d Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed concerns about the veering trajectory of Web3 from its original vision.\n\nButerin contends that the foundational principles of Web3 have gradually receded as various projects within the cryptocurrency space shift focus away from the core idea of decentralization.\n\nWeb3\u2019s Ideological Shift: A Growing Divide\n\n\n\nButerin identifies a substantial ideological divide, where segments of the non-blockchain decentralization community view the crypto world as a distraction rather than a kindred spirit and potent ally.\n\nInitially coined by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, the term Web3 was conceived not merely as \u2018Bitcoin plus smart contracts\u2019 but as part of a broader set of technologies forming the foundation of a more open internet stack.\n\nHowever, Vitalik Buterin observes that the practical use of cryptocurrency for financial transactions in many countries often relies on centralized means, such as internal transfers on centralized exchange accounts or trading USDT on platforms like Tron.\n\nVitalik Blames Rising Transaction Fees for the Shift\n\n\n\nVitalik Buterin points to a significant culprit behind the observed shift \u2014 the surge in transaction fees. When the cost of interacting with the blockchain was minimal, ranging from $0.001 to $0.1, developers envisioned diverse applications using blockchain technology in both financial and non-financial realms. However, with transaction fees surpassing $100, Buterin highlights the increasing prominence of \u2018degen gamblers\u2019 \u2013 high-risk traders \u2013 as a dominant user group.\n\nAs degen gamblers become the primary users on a large scale, Buterin argues that this reshapes public perception and internal culture within the crypto space. He emphasizes that the rise in transaction fees has played a pivotal role in steering Web3 away from its decentralized ethos."

The \u201cHodler Ratio\u201d chart emerges as a crucial tool, indicating the trust and long-term commitment investors place in Ethereum.\n\nThe \u201cHodler Ratio\u201d is a metric that gauges investor commitment by measuring the percentage of long-term holders. Recent data from this chart reveals Ethereum\u2019s ascendancy over Bitcoin in the proportion of long-term holders.

        "content": "This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Solana, and Binance Coin.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nIn a surprising move, Ethereum has taken the spotlight this week after booking a 4.6% price increase and outperforming Bitcoin. This change in the price action has sparked optimism that it may be just the start.\n\nThe price also made a higher high this year, which is another signal that buyers mean business and are ready to take ETH to new levels not seen since the last bull market. Bulls also came in strong at the $2,150 key support.\n\nLooking ahead, the bias is bullish on Ethereum, and the next key targets on the chart are found at $2,500 and $3,000.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nXRP has touched the parabola represented in yellow on the chart, which could spark some renewed volatility. While still in a flat trend, this cryptocurrency managed to book a 2% price increase this week.\n\nThe resistance at 68 cents continues to hold the price down, and any attempts at breaking it were rejected by the bears. The price also has good support at 54 cents.\n\nLooking ahead, a new test of the key resistance may lead to a breakout, especially if the altcoin market remains bullish thanks to Ethereum\u2019s current price action.\n\nChart by TradingView\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano has been struggling to make further gains this week and booked a 2% loss. Buyers and sellers are fighting at the 60 cents level which is a critical pivot point.\n\nShould bulls manage to turn this level into a support then the path will be clear towards higher levels with a key target at 83 cents. If they fail, then sellers may push ADA back towards 50 cents.\n\nLooking ahead, expect volatility to return as soon as one of the market participants gains the upper hand. Right now, ADA has been moving flat around 60 cents. Wait until there is a decisive breakout.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana appears to have topped once it reached a three digits valuation and the price quickly corrected. Despite this, it still managed to book a respectable 8% price increase this week.\n\nAs long as the uptrend remains intact, bull continue to have an advantage. However, selling may intensify here as a price at three digits is an attractive target for sellers that got in early. SOL has good support at $78 and strong resistance at $125.\n\nLooking ahead, if Solana manages to hold this uptrend intact and its price above $100 then the bias remains bullish. Any weakness in these two areas may quickly be exploited by sellers.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nBinance Coin has finally awaken and managed to reach a price over $300. In the process, it made new local highs and booked an 18% price increase. This makes BNB the best performed on our list this week.\n\nThis bullish reversal is quite surprising and brings back optimism to BNB which has been lagging for months after a difficult time from US regulators. The current resistance is at $360, and if broken, it can take BNB to new yearly highs.\n\nLooking ahead, with a new bull market on the horizon in 2024, this cryptocurrency can perform well considering Binance still maintains a dominant position in the market."

        "title": "Turing completeness in blockchain, explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Understanding Turing completeness in blockchain technology In computer science and blockchain technology, the term \u201cTuring completeness\u201d describes a system\u2019s ability to carry out any computation that a Turing machine is capable of. A Turing machine is a theoretical model of computation that can simulate any algorithm, making it a benchmark for computational universality. The concept of Turing completeness traces its roots back to the groundbreaking work of Alan Turing, a British mathematician and logician. In 1936, Turing introduced the idea of a theoretical computing machine that would later become known as the Turing machine. All the essential functions required for universal computation are present in a Turing-complete machine. It is capable of handling and modifying a wide range of data types, including lists, words and numbers. The machine facilitates repetition through loops and offers directives for decision-making, such as \u201cif-else\u201d statements. It also provides methods for retrieving and storing data from memory, which opens up a world of computational possibilities and allows it to express any algorithmic calculation. Turing completeness is a desired feature in the context of blockchain technology because it allows a blockchain platform to handle a variety of applications and smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing lines of code with the contract\u2019s conditions explicitly embedded into the code. These smart contracts may express complicated logic and perform a wide range of computational activities since blockchain platforms are Turing-complete. So, is Ethereum Turing-complete? Yes, the blockchain technology platform Ethereum is a prime example of Turing completeness. Solidity, its programming language, enables developers to design complex decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, transforming the field of blockchain-based applications. In 2012, Silvio Micali, who is well-known for his pivotal contributions to computer science, received the Turing Award. Micali\u2019s application of Turing completeness concepts in the building of the Algorand blockchain later served as a monument to his revolutionary work. Micali\u2019s Algorand is a prime example of Turing-complete algorithms being used in the context of decentralized networks. It has a unique consensus mechanism and scalability capabilities. Although complete blockchains enable the development of versatile and powerful applications, the concept also necessitates a careful approach to programming, testing and security to harness its benefits effectively.\n\nTuring completeness and its implications for smart contracts In essence, Turing completeness empowers smart contracts to be powerful, expressive and adaptable computational entities, revolutionizing the landscape of DApps on blockchain platforms. Turing completeness is a fundamental notion in computer science that has significant consequences for blockchain-based smart contracts. It means that a system is globally programmable if it can carry out any calculation that a Turing machine can. This trait confers a tremendous degree of flexibility and sophistication when applied to smart contracts. When implemented on Turing-complete blockchain systems like Ethereum, smart contracts enable a vast range of DApps and may express and run complicated algorithms. Turing completeness has various implications for smart contracts. Firstly, it makes it possible to create flexible and dynamic contracts that go beyond straightforward transactional procedures. Smart contracts can now be programmed to represent complex business conditions and rules. However, with this power comes responsibility. To ensure the security and predictability of smart contract execution, great care must be taken during the development and auditing phases due to the possibility of infinite loops or unforeseen repercussions. Furthermore, the notion fosters creativity by permitting developers to investigate and execute a wide array of applications, thereby aiding in the development of decentralized ecosystems.\n\nWhat role does the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) play in Ethereum\u2019s Turing completeness? The EVM enables the expression of complex computations and sophisticated decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. As the Ethereum network\u2019s smart contract execution environment, the EVM is a crucial part of Ethereum\u2019s fulfillment of Turing completeness. It gives programmers the ability to create and run DApps using a platform that supports Ethereum\u2019s native programming language, Solidity. This language is intentionally designed to be Turing-complete, enabling the expression of any computable function. Ethereum\u2019s flexibility stems from its decentralized processing enabled by the EVM, which enables the blockchain to run sophisticated algorithms and business logic. The gas mechanism of the EVM, a unique Ethereum feature that controls computing resources, is one of its most noteworthy characteristics. Users are required to pay for the resources used by the EVM, as each operation uses a certain quantity of gas. As a result, the network is kept stable and effective by preventing abuse and resource-intensive processes. Furthermore, the EVM\u2019s compatibility encourages smooth communication among different smart contracts, increasing the possibility of complex and networked decentralized systems. The The Ethereum Virtual Machine is essential to Ethereum\u2019s ability to be Turing-complete, allowing for a wide range of DApps and bolstering Ethereum\u2019s standing in the blockchain industry.\n\nIs the Bitcoin blockchain Turing-complete? No, the Bitcoin blockchain is not Turing complete, and this is by design. Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language purposefully lacks Turing completeness\u2019 full expressive capability, even though it does allow for some programmability. Bitcoin Script, the scripting language used by Bitcoin, is Turing incomplete by design. In keeping with Bitcoin\u2019s core goal of functioning as a decentralized digital currency system rather than a platform for intricate programmability, Bitcoin Script aimed to maintain security and avoid potential weaknesses. Turing completeness creates the possibility of undecidable calculations or infinite loops, which can be maliciously used. By not being Turing-complete, the scripting language used by Bitcoin reduces this risk and ensures that scripts run predictably and terminate in a reasonable amount of time. Bitcoin relies on a decentralized consensus mechanism, where all nodes on the network must agree on the state of the blockchain. Turing completeness may result in non-deterministic behavior, which would make consensus-reaching among all nodes difficult. The Bitcoin blockchain ensures predictable execution and consistent consensus among nodes by preserving a non-Turing-complete programming language. Several programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, Java and Ruby, are Turing-complete, providing the capability to execute arbitrary algorithms. Turing-complete blockchains other than Ethereum include Tezos, which uses Michelson for smart contract creation; Cardano with its Plutus language; NEO, which supports numerous languages; and BNB Smart Chain, which is compatible with Ethereum\u2019s Solidity language."

        "title": "Record Crypto Options Volume Expires Pre-Bitcoin ETF Deadline: Analyzing BTC And ETH Reactions - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The recovery of the overall crypto market this year has spurred a surge in the digital-asset derivatives market as institutional investors seek exposure to the crypto space.\n\nAccording to a recent Bloomberg report, the deadline for US regulators to approve or reject Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has prompted traditional investors to turn to crypto options and futures, leading to unprecedented trading volumes.\n\nCrypto Options Trading Hits Record High\n\nBefore the options expiry on Friday morning, crypto options trading volume reached a new all-time high, with options worth a notional value of $11 billion, as highlighted by Bloomberg. Of this total, Bitcoin contracts accounted for $7.7 billion, while Ethereum (ETH) options represented $3.5 billion.\n\nDespite the expiration of many options, the impact on the major cryptocurrencies has been limited. With its strong support floor at $42,000, Bitcoin has maintained its position for a potential uptrend once bullish momentum returns and buying pressure increases.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has traded within the same range as the previous day, at $42,200, experiencing only a 0.4% decline. Nevertheless, Bitcoin has yet to fully recover from its 3.4% drop over the past seven days.\n\nIn contrast, ETH was hit by the expiration of options contracts. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market, fell more than 2%. EHT dropped to $2,316 after hitting an annual high of $2,445 on Thursday.\n\nHowever, while heightened trading activity may accompany the expiration of options, it is unlikely to impact spot market prices, according to Luuk Strijers significantly, Deribit\u2019s chief commercial officer.\n\nStrijers notes that clients are rolling their positions to 2024 expiries, and additional activity is anticipated after the expiry. The focus of attention and trading activity will primarily be on the impending ETF decision, Bloomberg notes.\n\nSurge From Traditional Asset Managers\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has undergone a strong rally this year, with Bitcoin surging nearly 160% following a turbulent 2022 marked by industry scandals and price declines.\n\nThe recovery has been fueled partly by the optimism surrounding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which would attract a broader range of investors to the asset class.\n\nRyan Kim, head of derivatives at digital-asset prime brokerage FalconX, highlights the growing participation from crossover macro accounts, referring to large traditional asset managers allocating a small percentage of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies and crypto-focused hedge funds.\n\nIn addition, according to Bloomberg, perpetual futures, a favored tool for leveraging crypto trades, are trading at a significant premium compared to spot prices, indicating rising demand for such products.\n\nOverall, the surge in the cryptocurrency derivatives market, driven by options expiry and the pending decision on Bitcoin ETFs, reflects the growing interest of institutional investors in the crypto space.\n\nThe record-breaking trading volumes and increased participation from traditional asset managers highlight the evolving landscape of digital assets.\n\nAs the market awaits the regulatory verdict on Bitcoin ETFs, it remains to be seen how these developments will shape the future trajectory of the crypto market and its integration with traditional financial systems.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nTop crypto analysts are seeing a bullish outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), growth that their on-chart performance and upward momentum will fuel.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Pentoshi is bullish on ETH, while crypto analyst TechDev highlighted that BTC\u2019s OBV is hinting at potentially new peaks.\n\nMany are now diversifying their holdings with Meme Moguls (MGLS). This upcoming platform will enable virtual trading and help anyone improve their trading strategies. We will go over each one to see why they are the best altcoins to buy.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Projected to Rise by TechDev \u2013 Price to Move Above $66,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) could soon see a major price rally, following its solid performance in the previous month. Crypto analyst TechDev highlighted that Bitcoin\u2019s on-balance volume (OBV) is currently hinting at potential new peaks through a post on X (Twitter). The analyst also noted how each time the OBV hints at a new high, the price of Bitcoin also achieves a new peak within one candle on the two-month chart.\n\nDuring the past week, BTC traded between $40,766.45 and $44,217.04. In the last 30 days, its up 14.2%, and according to the Bitcoin price prediction, it can surge to $66,583.71 in 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH) to Initiate Bull Run According to Pentoshi \u2013 Is $4,000 Possible?\n\nPentoshi, a pseudonymous analyst with over 700,000 followers on X (Twitter) noted that the possible approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs next year can give the crypto a solid boost.\n\nMultiple asset management firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Hashdex filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Pentoshi says that Ethereum will likely generate bullish momentum as a result of this.\n\nAs for the on-chart data, during the past week, Ethereum traded between $2,130.73 and $2,335.37. During the past year, the crypto is up 86%, and according to the Ethereum price prediction it can surge as far as $4,031.01 in 2024.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) Can Spike 100x Based Projections\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS) has seen bullish momentum with its crypto ICO as it is introducing an entire Play-to-Earn (P2E) ecosystem that can disrupt the industry by introducing a new method in which players can learn how to invest while building wealth.\n\nAnyone can learn about investing and begin building their wealth with the innovative approach of virtual trading. In the Meme Moguls ecosystem, players are introduced to the world through getting $100,000 in virtual cash.\n\nAs a result, they can utilize it to create a portfolio. They can complete challenges and, by doing so, have the opportunity to turn the simulated profits into cashable returns.\n\nMembers of the community are also able to set up custom tournaments and even create prize pool buy-ins.\n\nThere is a game mode known as Beat The Market, for example, and each player outperforms the S&P 500 index to win. With the overall interest in meme-inspired assets growing and the vast ecosystem on offer, analysts expect the MGLS token to grow by 100x at launch. These aspects make it one of the best altcoins to buy.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum could both see a surge in value, but it will take some time for the cryptocurrencies to get there. In the meantime, Meme Moguls made massive waves with its crypto ICO. At Stage 3, the crypto is offered at a value of just $0.0025. As a result, this represents a solid entry point for those looking to diversify.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Are BRC-20 Tokens Worth the Hype? Uncover the Truth Behind the Future of Bitcoin - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Amassing over $600M in market cap and blowing Ethereum (ETH) NFT trading volume out of the water, BRC-20 Tokens and Ordinal inscriptions are here to stay. Initially considered an experimental flash in the pan, BRC-20 tokens have exploded onto the market, redefining how we use Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain may be the forefather of the entire crypto industry, but you cannot deny that it lacks utility. Compared to modern, smart contract-capable platforms like Ethereum and Solana (SOL), there\u2019s not much you can do with BTC other than HODL it or send it to another wallet.\n\nUntil now.\n\nWhat are BRC-20 Tokens? Are they reinventing BTC forever, or is the BRC-20 token standard polluting the Bitcoin network and leading the crypto world down a dark path?\n\nWhat are BRC-20 Tokens?\n\nAn extension of Casey Rodarmor\u2019s Ordinals protocol, the BRC-20 token standard creates fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. Created by Domo, a pseudonymous blockchain developer, BRC-20 is an experimental token standard that inscribes text or other fungible data onto individual Satoshis.\n\nBut why is this important, and why have the first BRC-20 tokens like ORDI, VMPX, and meme coins like PEPE (not that PEPE) exploded in value?\n\nSince it was originally launched in 2009, the Bitcoin network has provided a rather narrow range of utilities. BTC can be stored in a self-custodial wallet or sent to another Bitcoin wallet in exchange for value.\n\nNetwork upgrades like the Lightning Layer 2 Network might have helped Bitcoin become faster and more affordable, but the basic functions remain the same.\n\nBRC-20 tokens flip the script by adding greater complexity and utility to the Bitcoin network. In the same way that smart contracts govern innovative applications using the ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum and other EVM networks, BRC-20 tokens open a new world of possibilities on the Bitcoin blockchain, including decentralized finance.\n\nTapping into Bitcoin\u2019s unmatched market depth and liquidity, the BRC-20 token standard means that fungible satoshis can be traded directly on the Bitcoin network. As such, this novel phenomenon offers huge potential to expand the capabilities of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nHow Do BRC-20 Tokens Work?\n\nInstead of using smart contracts like Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 tokens, the BRC-20 protocol works by embedding custom JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) scripts onto individual satoshis, the smallest unit of BTC.\n\nThis allows BRC-20 tokens like SATS and TRAC to be traded natively over the Bitcoin blockchain or used as collateral and borrowed against in Bitcoin-based DeFi protocols. This on-chain functionality is perhaps one of the biggest advancements in the history of the Bitcoin network, providing previously unimaginable use cases for Bitcoin.\n\nAre BRC-20 Tokens the Same as Ordinals?\n\nAt this point, we need to make a clear distinction. While BRC-20 tokens use the foundational technology behind Bitcoin Ordinals, they\u2019re not quite the same thing. Technically speaking, BRC-20 tokens are Ordinals because they\u2019re created by inscribing data to individual Satoshis.\n\nDespite this, BRC-20s and Ordinals have one key difference: Fungibility.\n\nWhile each Bitcoin Ordinal is non-fungible and designed to be completely unique and distinguishable from each other, BRC-20s with the same name are interchangeable and bear the same value.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s look at one of the most popular Bitcoin Ordinal collections. As you can see, each and every one of these Bitcoin Frogs is different. Due to having different traits, some might be worth more than others.\n\nORDI tokens, on the other hand, are all the same. If I loan a friend 100 ORDI tokens, they don\u2019t need to pay me back the specific coins I gave them for the loan to be repaid. The 100 ORDI tokens I lent my friend are exactly identical to any other 100 ORDI tokens in the supply.\n\nHow to Trade BRC-20 Tokens\n\nAt this stage, dozens of permissionless marketplaces have cropped up all across the cryptocurrency space, allowing BRC-20 enthusiasts to trade to their heart\u2019s content.\n\nSome top-performing BRC-20 tokens with the highest trading volume and liquidity have even found their way onto top exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, and OKX.\n\nFor those who prefer an on-chain experience, you\u2019ll need a funded Bitcoin wallet supporting Taproot. Popular choices amongst the BRC-20 community include:\n\nUnisat Wallet\n\nXverse Wallet\n\nLeather Wallet\n\nOKX Wallet\n\nOnce you\u2019ve withdrawn some BTC to your Ordinal and BRC-20 compatible wallet, the easiest way to get involved is through BRC-20 trading sites like the Unisat Marketplace. From there, you can scan the range of tokens available and place orders on coins as you see fit.\n\nHow to Mint BRC-20 Tokens\n\nIf you have a higher risk for appetite, minting BRC-20 tokens is like partaking in an ICO. After a developer has registered a new BRC-20 token, you\u2019ll be able to inscribe the JSON scripts to Bitcoin satoshis yourself using platforms like Unisat.\n\nFor the purposes of this explanation, let\u2019s say I wanted to mint some YISU tokens. I\u2019d find YISU in the list of ongoing mints, review the token\u2019s information, and then click \u2018Mint Directly\u2019.\n\nAs you can see, this particular token only allows me to mint 2,100 inscriptions at a time. However, if I wanted to mint more than that, say 21,000, I\u2019d need to set the mint transaction to repeat 10 times.\n\nFrom there, input the BRC-20 compatible Bitcoin address where you\u2019d like to receive your tokens and set your preferred transaction fee based on network congestion.\n\nHit \u2018Submit & Pay Invoice\u2019 and confirm the transaction in your wallet. If you paid enough gas, your freshly inscribed BRC-20 tokens should appear in your wallet within 30 minutes.\n\nDisclaimer: YISU was randomly selected from the list of ongoing BRC-20 mints and is not endorsed by DailyCoin in any way, shape, or form.\n\nBRC-20 Token Concerns\n\nDespite being a huge step forward for blockchain technology in the Bitcoin ecosystem, these new digital assets have caused plenty of controversy within the Bitcoin community.\n\nThe Bitcoin Ordinal protocol, and by extension, BRC-20 tokens, demand enormous energy and resources. Inscribing immutable data onto individual satoshis is no easy feat, with the Proof-of-Work suffering debilitating network congestion that has sent Bitcoin transaction fees to all-time highs.\n\nBitcoin maximalists have been particularly scathing of the Ordinal and BRC-20 movement, arguing that these new tokens are polluting the network and detracting from Bitcoin\u2019s primary ethos.\n\nThe hype and excitement around BRC-20 tokens have also led to a massive influx of rug pulls, speculative pump-and-dumps, and scams. On top of that, the Bitcoin network\u2019s long block time (10 minutes) makes it easier for other users to front-run transactions by supercharging their gas payments. As a result, many users suffer from failed transactions when interacting with BRC-20 protocols.\n\nBRC-20 Pros and Cons\n\nBRC-20 tokens and Bitcoin Ordinals may herald a new utility age on the Bitcoin network, but they\u2019re far from faultless. Let\u2019s objectively examine the pros and cons of BRC-20 tokens.\n\nPros\n\nBringing new utility to Bitcoin \u2013 BRC-20 tokens open a world of possibilities with the Bitcoin ecosystem and provide a wealth of new use cases to Bitcoin.\n\n\u2013 BRC-20 tokens open a world of possibilities with the Bitcoin ecosystem and provide a wealth of new use cases to Bitcoin.

When that niche community of degens dominates a blockchain's user base, he said, \"this adjusts the public perception and the crypto space's internal culture,\" leading to negative outcomes.\n\nIt's not all bad news, though. Buterin pointed to positive developments over the past year, including scaling solutions such as rollups, the ERC-4337 account abstraction standard, and light clients on Ethereum.\n\nHe also zeroed in on privacy solutions such as Railway and Nocturne, and devoted a large portion of the essay to zero-knowledge proofs, a \"very powerful new tool\" used to prove that something is known without directly exposing the known information.\n\n\"The programmability of zero knowlege proofs means that we can get past the false binary of \"anonymous but risky\" vs \"KYC'd therefore safe\", and get privacy and many kinds of authentication and verification at the same time,\" Buterin wrote. He pointed to use cases such as Zupass, an in-person authentication system that enables anonymous voting and identification.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButerin has previously advocated for \"privacy pools\" using zk-proofs to validate users aren't using criminal blockchain addresses, while retaining the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nAs well as building out Ethereum's technical stack, Buterin held forth on the importance of its \"social layer,\" which, he said, \"vigorously enforces its values in those places where pure incentives can't.\" He pointed to the challenge of integrating \"degen gamblers\" who come to the crypto ecosystem out of a desire to get rich, but who are turned into \"avid believers\" in the ideals of Web3 and decentralization.\n\nThat, he believes, can be achieved through a mix of incentives, community and \"hard norms of neutrality, open source and censorship resistance.\"\n\nFor Ethereum to succeed, Buterin said, \"we need not only a vision for a technical stack, but also the social parts of the stack that make the technical stack possible to build in the first place.\""

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nEthereum (ETH) shows signs of weakness, but there are mixed signals as whales keep amassing impressive amounts of ETH. Meanwhile, investors and crypto enthusiasts are keeping an eye on BONK and Pullix, two cryptos set to embellish the festive spirit with 100x gains. Here\u2019s what you should know if you want to start 2024 in the green.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Correction: A Chance for the Whales to Shine?\n\nIn just the past five days, ETH has dipped by about 1.25%. Now, while that might sound like a bit of a slump, it's actually sparked an intriguing move among the big players, the whales of the crypto ocean. They've been diving in, scooping up more ETH.\n\nCould this be their way of signaling a potential turnaround for Ethereum? It's definitely something to keep an eye on.\n\nBut here's an interesting twist - while these whales are busy accumulating, the overall trading volume of Ethereum has taken a nosedive. This suggests that the broader investor community isn't as active right now.\n\nDespite this, some whales have confidently added over 100,000 ETH to their stash, valued at a whopping $230 million. This uptick in whale activity, coupled with a rise in the Ethereum supply held by top addresses, hints that they might be seeing something the rest of us haven\u2019t caught onto yet.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a catch. Ethereum\u2019s MACD indicates a bearish crossover, hinting at the possibility of a further downtrend in the near term. Because of this, investors are now eyeing other promising cryptocurrencies like BONK and Pullix.\n\nBONK Price Prediction\n\nIn a stunning turn of events, a trader recently transformed a $16k investment into a staggering $10 million, thanks to the meteoric rise of Bonk (BONK). This growth spurt followed BONK's recent listings on major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase.\n\nOver the last month, BONK's value has skyrocketed by 300% and has risen by a phenomenal 21,000% since its all-time low in December of the previous year.\n\nThese numbers are more than just impressive; they've catapulted BONK into the spotlight as one of 2023\u2019s top crypto to buy.\n\nFinally, regarding BONK price prediction, the sentiment remains bullish, although the market is highly volatile. Some believe that it could reach $0.00004 in early 2024 if the momentum remains strong.\n\nPullix (PLX) \u2013 Here\u2019s Why This Promising Presale Could Reach 100x\n\nPullix steps in with a hybrid platform that uniquely combines the security of centralized systems with the flexibility of decentralized finance. This approach solves the persistent liquidity and security issues that have long been a thorn in the side of DeFi enthusiasts.\n\nCurrently, Pullix is in Stage 4 of its presale, priced attractively at $0.046.. But here's where it gets really exciting \u2013 market analysts are predicting a staggering 580% rise in PLX value and a mind-blowing 100x growth once it launches. Remember the astronomical surge Bonk experienced after hitting major exchanges? That's the kind of prediction we're talking about for Pullix.\n\nPullix isn\u2019t just another token; it's the world's first 'Trade-to-Earn' token, redefining how you interact with crypto. As a PLX holder, you're not just holding a token; you're tapping into the daily revenues of the platform. Plus, there's no need for KYC as you can use your crypto as collateral. And if you\u2019re interested in passive income, staking PLX could fetch you up to 18% APR.\n\nSummary\n\nAll in all, Pullix presale is rapidly gaining traction, advancing through the stages as early backers stand to enjoy up to 580% gains by the end of the presale. With robust predictions and strong fundamentals, it\u2019s no wonder that Pullix could follow in the steps of BONK and reward its backers with over 100x gains, making it one of the top crypto to buy in 2024.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix\u2019s presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn a recent interview with CNBC Television, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein gave a positive outlook on the future of Bitcoin, predicting a significant influx of capital into the market upon the anticipated approval of spot market Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nSonnenshein\u2019s optimism stems from the belief that this regulatory approval could open the floodgates for a massive investment opportunity, potentially attracting up to $30 trillion from previously untapped markets into crypto majors such as Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP, Cardano, Shiba Inu.\n\nUnlocking Opportunities for Investors\n\nSonnenshein highlighted the current market sentiment, noting a growing trend among investors actively diversifying their portfolios with Bitcoin. However, he pointed out a crucial barrier to a specific group of investors, particularly those in the advised market in the U.S., which is worth around a staggering $30 trillion. Regulatory constraints have prevented these investors from entering the crypto market.\n\nThe Grayscale CEO believes that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs could be a game-changer, providing a viable way for these investors to gain exposure to BTC. Grayscale has been working towards spot-based Bitcoin ETFs through its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product.\n\nLegal Challenges and Regulatory Progress\n\nGrayscale encountered regulatory problems last year when the SEC rejected its proposal to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot market Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale took legal action against the SEC, and approximately a year later, a federal judge ruled in their favour. The judge\u2019s decision mandated the SEC to reconsider Grayscale\u2019s application, emphasizing the importance of avoiding inconsistencies in regulatory decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis legal victory reflects Grayscale\u2019s persistence and shows the significance of a fair and consistent regulatory framework in crypto. The ongoing legal battles and regulatory developments show steps in the right direction for the growth of the crypto space.\n\nAs the crypto industry awaits regulatory approval for spot market Bitcoin ETFs, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein\u2019s positive outlook suggests that a significant financial wave, potentially reaching up to $30 trillion, could surge into the crypto market. The approval of these ETFs can streamline Bitcoin investments, allowing more investors to have exposure to digital assets.\n\nThe ongoing legal battles and regulatory developments highlight the dynamic landscape and growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, setting the stage for a new era in the crypto space. Investors and industry participants will follow these events as they unfold, as they could shape the future trajectory of Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the second-largest crypto asset, Ethereum, has proposed strategies to cut down complexity in the network. He stated that the approach would handle challenges with the blockchain\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, making it lighter and simpler.\n\nEthereum PoS Consensus Mechanism And Associated Complexity\n\nButerin recently laid out three strategies to curb Ethereum\u2019s PoS challenges. The crypto mogul noted that the solutions would ensure the decentralization of the network and allow simpler and lighter functionality.\n\nButerin suggested a reduction in the number of validators\u2019 signatures needed to keep the blockchain operating.\n\nHe said this move would drop the load on the Ethereum consensus mechanism. According to his Proof-of-Stake simplification proposal, allowing only 8192 validator signatures in each slot (even with SSF) will significantly simplify and lighten consensus implementation.\n\nA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 27, 2023\n\nRecall Ethereum transitioned into a proof-of-stake (PoS) crypto model from proof-of-work (PoW) following the \u2018Merge\u2019 in September 2022. The process brought the combination of the Beacon Chain and the Ethereum mainnet, resulting in the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain.\n\nHowever, the transition hasn\u2019t eliminated some scalability and validator overload issues troubling the network. Buterin\u2019s post came as a solution to issues from the increasing validators on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAlso, the growing number of validators has spiked the volume of cryptographic signatures the network requires to maintain its operations.\n\nNotably, Ethereum needs about 895,000 validators to maintain decentralization and enable participation in staking. The setback is that it must process up to 28,000 validators\u2019 signatures per slot, which creates a huge load on the network.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal focused on an effective reduction of signature counts on Ethereum to resolve the associated complexity on the blockchain.\n\nHe believed that cutting down the signatures to just 8,192 per slot could offer a moderate solution to the network\u2019s excessive loads. Further, he noted that the reduction would ensure major technical simplification and increase quantum resistance.\n\nAlso, it would keep up the total slashable ETH between one and two million ETH.\n\nButerin Lays Out Three Strategies As Solutions To Ethereum\u2019s PoS Complexity\n\nGenerally, the three strategies in Buterin\u2019s proposal include the following. The first approach is centered on decentralized staking pools. The co-founder suggested an increase in Ether\u2019s staking threshold for validators.\n\nThis means that instead of the current requirement of 32 ETH, the amount should be higher.\n\nButerin believed that the change would prompt validators to collaborate and join their resources, forming decentralized staking pools. The second strategy brings the possibility of having two grades of ETH stakers/validators on the network.\n\nThe first tier will get higher minimum staking requirements, while the other will have lesser demands. The co-founder noted that two tiers would have different roles in maintaining the Ethereum blockchain finality.\n\nHowever, their combined operation and participation would bring stability and security to the network.\n\nThe last solution focused on rotating the validators\u2019 participation. Buterin suggested that the network should adopt a process of randomly selecting a group of validators for each slot.\n\nThis approach will ensure an even distribution of the workload among the validators and reduce the total signatures required for finality. However, the co-founder noted that the method could create new challenges on the network."

Hence, the crypto exchange is set to delist liquidity pools concerning Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and XRP.\n\nadvertisement\n\nList Of Liquidity Pools To Be Removed From Binance Liquid Swap\n\nAccording to the latest announcement, the following Binance liquidity pools are slated for removal on January 5, 2024, at 04:00 a.m. UTC:\n\nADA/BTC\n\nBNB/USDT\n\nBTC/USDT\n\nDOGE/BTC\n\nDOGE/USDT\n\nETH/USDT\n\nLINK/BTC\n\nSHIB/USDT\n\nUSDT/DAI\n\nXRP/USDT\n\nIt is important to note that users with positions in these pools will automatically receive their deposited assets in their Spot wallets on January 5, 2024, at 04:00 a.m. UTC. Moreover, Binance noted that these liquidity pools will not impact the trading of corresponding pairs on Binance Spot.\n\nUsers also have the option to redeem their assets from these pools before January 5, 2024, at 04:00 a.m. UTC. If one fails to redeem their deposits before this date, they will be automatically redeemed based on prevailing composition ratios to users\u2019 Spot wallets. However, starting from January 1, 2024, at 04:00 a.m. UTC, traders would not be able to add liquidity to the above-mentioned pools.\n\nAlso Read: Binance User Base Swells 30% in 2023 Amid Regulatory Challenges\n\nDelisting Of GBP Spot Trading Pairs\n\nAs reported by Coingape earlier, Binance had recently announced the delisting of various cryptocurrency trading pairs in GBP on Binance Spot. The delisting plan included significant pairs such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Chainlink (LINK), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC). The delisting has been effective from December 29, 2023.\n\nEarlier, in October 2023, the crypto trading platform ceased accepting new customers in the UK in order to adhere to the new FCA regulations, which limit promotions from international digital asset firms in the country. Thereafter, users trading via GBP faced issues regarding withdrawals and deposits after the exchange terminated its operating agreement with its banking partner in the UK. Hence, it had to delist the spot trading pairs to ease the challenges faced by its users.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Relists SOL, XRP, ADA, MATIC & Other Top Crypto In USDC Pairs"

        "title": "We Asked ChatGPT if Solana (SOL) Can Become the Biggest Altcoin in 2024 - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token has shown impressive performance this year, with significant growth in price and market capitalization, making it one of the top digital currencies in the market.\n\nFuture growth potential for SOL hinges on factors like technology adoption, overcoming past network issues, regulatory developments, and potential strategic partnerships, which could enhance its market value and utility.\n\nDespite its progress, SOL\u2019s market cap is still behind major players like Ethereum, but it has surpassed them in certain metrics like trading volume and NFT sales volume in recent times.\n\nCan Solana (SOL) Progress Even More Next Year?\n\nSolana\u2019s native token \u2013 SOL \u2013 has been a top performer this year, with its price reaching almost $125 earlier this week. The token has skyrocketed by over 1,000% since January 1, while its market capitalization briefly surpassed the $50 billion mark and is currently standing at around $48 billion (per CoinGecko\u2019s data).\n\nThis uptrend has made SOL the fourth-largest digital currency in the entire market, outpacing Binance Coin (BNB) and Ripple (XRP).\n\nIn the following lines we will take a deeper dive and check whether the asset\u2019s progress could continue next year with SOL becoming the biggest alternative coin in the realm.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, such a scenario is not out of the cards but hinges on on multiple elements. One major factor is the possible adoption of the asset\u2019s technology and network. Solana is known for its low costs and fast transaction speed, which makes it a preferred ecosystem for decentralized applications.\n\nThe AI-powered chatbot also estimated that SOL\u2019s future success depends on coping with some issues that have caused reputational damage to the blockchain protocol in the past. Recall that Solana has experienced numerous network outages in the last few years.\n\nRegulatory development was also outlined as a vital factor. According to ChatGPT, the implementation of favorable rules in the crypto industry could have a positive impact on SOL.\n\nLast but not least, the chatbot pointed out possible partnerships that the blockchain entity might strike up with prominent organizations. Such strategic collaborations could enhance SOL\u2019s utility and adoption, potentially boosting its market value.\n\nDespite its rapid recent progress, SOL\u2019s market capitalization is still far from Ethereum\u2019s (almost $270 billion) and the one of USDT ($91 billion), meaning it has a long way to go before being throned as the largest altcoin.\n\nSolana has Already Surpassed Ethereum in These Metrics\n\nIt is worth noting that Solana has performed better than its rival for the top \u2013 Ethereum \u2013 in some aspects. According to DefiLlama, trading volume on Solana has surged above $1.3 billion in the past few days. For the most part of the month, Ethereum was lagging behind.\n\nSolana has also performed quite well in the non-fungible token space, registering an NFT sales volume of over $88 million in the last week. Ethereum has fallen behind with approximately $74 million for the same period.\n\nWhat is more, Solana flipped Ethereum in terms of search volumes on Google, which is a testament to the growing interest in the cryptocurrency."

        "content": "Lido's staked Ether dominance has trended down since early December.\n\nBy: Samuel Haig \u2022 Loading...\n\nDeFi News\n\nLido\u2019s staking dominance has fallen in recent weeks despite continued inflows to the controversial Layer 2 network, Blast.\n\nAccording to Dune Analytics, Lido currently controls 31.8% of the staked Ether supply, down from more than 32.3% three weeks ago. Daily tweets from the LidoDominance X account show Lido\u2019s dominance steadily falling since tagging a local high on Dec. 5.\n\nLido\u2019s diminishing command over the supply of staked Ether follows renewed scrutiny from Ethereum decentralization devotees who feared that the rising value of assets locked in Blast, a forthcoming Layer 2 network, could push Lido\u2019s dominance above one-third.\n\nBlast burst onto the scene in late November, announcing it would reward early depositors with native yields in the form of staking rewards via Lido or stablecoin interests via MakerDAO, in addition to Blast \u201cpoints.\u201d The airdrop campaign attracted a surge in deposits despite the assets being locked until Blast\u2019s mainnet deployment, which is currently slated to take place in February.\n\nBlast\u2019s early success came to the chagrin of many Ethereum\u2019s, with analysts blaming Blast for Lido\u2019s dominance crossing back above the 32% threshold for the first time since Oct. 12. Ethereum researchers have frequently warned that a single entity controlling more than a third of staked Ether could threaten to undermine the network\u2019s decentralization.\n\nHowever, Lido\u2019s dominance has since retraced despite Blast\u2019s total value locked (TVL) rallying to new heights this week. A $54M inflow pushed Blast\u2019s TVL to $1.12B on Dec. 29 after a $50M inflow pushed the protocol\u2019s TVL above $1B for the first time on Dec. 26, according to DeFi Llama. Blast tweeted that nearly 86,000 users have deposited assets onto the network."

Profit booking before the new year resulted in a decline below $43,200. The current consolidation level is $42,500, with immediate resistance at $43,000. A successful close above this level could propel the price higher, while support rests at $42,150.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is currently facing a key point at $42,854, which is a critical moment for potential price movement. Immediate resistance levels at $44,038, $44,693 and $45,973 represent significant barriers to upside momentum. Conversely, support lies at $41,714 with additional reserves at $40,653 and $39,520 against potential downside. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 43 indicates a bearish sentiment that is dipping below the mid-50s. A bearish engulfing candle below the 50-day EMA at $43,000 reinforces the bearish trend. The double-day support level at $40,600 is crucial as a break could trigger a significant downtrend. Bitcoin's overall trend seems bearish below $43,000, pulled by the RSI, 50 EMA and observed chart patterns. Monitoring key levels is crucial, with $41,714 as key support and a potential reversal above $43,000 changing the bearish scenario.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe latest action by FIU demonstrates the government\u2019s commitment to creating a safe and regulated digital asset ecosystem in India. The main objective of this move is to protect investors and prevent illicit use of digital assets. The decision to include foreign crypto exchanges as reporting entities is a crucial step and was highly anticipated by the experts. The major impact will be on the trading activities on the foreign crypto bourses and we may see a significant shift of trading volume to Indian exchanges which are FIU compliant. I think the government should take a calculated approach in blocking URLs of foreign crypto exchanges as a lot of Indian traders might have stored their digital assets on such bourses.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cn the last 24 hours, BTC experienced a 2% decline, and ETH saw a decrease of more than 1%. BTC has been moving sideways within the range of $41,900 and $44,500 over the past few days, currently sitting at the incline trendline support. If it sustains at this level, there might be a chance for another touch of the resistance level at $44,500. ETH is currently below the resistance level of $2,380, and in the lower time frame, it appears bullish as it remains above the 20 EMA D.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
