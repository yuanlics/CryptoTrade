        "title": "How to Stake Ethereum - Investopedia",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin. Recently, Ethereum changed its consensus mechanism to allow anyone to participate in staking, the process of locking up ETH tokens to help secure the Ethereum network and earn rewards in return.\n\nWhen you stake ETH, you are essentially acting as a validator for the network. Randomly chosen validators holding a minimum amount of ETH are responsible for verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. In exchange for your work, you earn freshly minted ETH and portions of network transaction fees.\n\n\n\nThis article will explore Ethereum staking and its benefits and risks, as well as share tips for finding a reliable and trustworthy staking platform based on criteria such as security, fees, and reputation.\n\nKey Takeaways Ethereum staking involves committing ether to validate transactions on the Ethereum network and earn ETH for your efforts.\n\nEthereum can be staked independently or through a third party such as a crypto wallet, exchange, or staking pool.\n\nEthereum replaced its energy-intensive, computation-driven Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining consensus mechanism with a financially-governed Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to address environmental, scalability, and centralization concerns.\n\n\n\nEthereum staking carries the benefits of passive income, network security contribution, governance influence, ecological sustainability, and capital appreciation but also the risks of hardware expenses, cybersecurity threats, technical malfunctioning, prolonged investment opportunity costs, and financial penalties.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Staking\n\nEthereum staking was made possible after the network transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, also known as Ethereum 2.0 or Eth2, in September 2022. Ethereum staking is not just possible after it switched to PoS, it's essential for the Ethereum blockchain to function.\n\nBefore the switch, computational consensus was used to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. Similar to Bitcoin's PoW system, which allows participants to earn newly minted BTC, Ethereum cryptocurrency miners competed to solve complex mathematical puzzles, and the first to solve the puzzle would earn the right to add the next block and receive a reward in ETH. PoW was energy-intensive and required specialized hardware.\n\nAfter the switch, social consensus became used to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. Validators can now stake their ETH to participate in the network, and are chosen randomly to add blocks and earn rewards. PoS is significantly less energy-intensive and does not require specialized hardware.\n\nThe transition from PoW to PoS, known as \"The Merge,\" marked a significant milestone in Ethereum's development, addressing key concerns of energy consumption, scalability, and centralization associated with PoW.\n\nPoW consumed vast energy, raising environmental concerns and the overall cost of maintaining the Ethereum network. Additionally, reliance on computational power limited the network's scalability and favored miners with access to specialized hardware and cheap electricity. Centralization of network power hindered Ethereum's ability to handle a growing number of transactions and users.\n\nHow to Stake Ethereum\n\nUsers who want to participate in Ethereum staking have the option of solo staking, staking-as-a-service, or pooled staking. The tradeoffs and trust assumptions of staking independently or through an intermediary vary.\n\nIn general, staking-as-a-service and pooled staking are good options for those with smaller amounts of ETH, as there may be no minimum deposit requirement. Solo staking offers the highest potential rewards, but it requires a higher minimum deposit requirement and a capital investment associated with the purchase and maintenance of hardware for a node. This computer will act as a validator.\n\nMinimum deposit requirements for staking-as-a-service and pooled staking, if there are any, are lower than for solo taking. Some exchanges and wallets may require a minimum deposit of as little as 0.1 ETH to 5 ETH worth of cryptocurrency. Staking solo will always require a minimum stake of 32 ETH, the amount required to run a validator node on the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\nHardware costs for the Ethereum validator node start at $1000 to $2000 and can go up from there, depending on the specific components and their quality and whether these components break down, become outdated, and need to be replaced.\n\nSolo Staking\n\nSolo staking is when you set up your staking node, run the software on your hardware, and generate and hold the node's cryptographic keys, which consist of both public and private keys, by yourself. This independence offers maximum control and decentralization, but at the cost of constant uptime and technical expertise.\n\nFailing to properly set up the validator node, secure its keys, understand the Ethereum network's protocols, and propose or vote on a block on time could result in loss of funds and prove challenging for users with non-technical backgrounds and busy schedules.\n\nThe average frequency of proposing a block is approximately once every 45 minutes, and the average frequency of voting on a block is approximately once every 45 seconds. These frequencies are estimated using probability calculations associated with validator selection.\n\nThe probability of being chosen to propose a block equals the validator's stake divided by the total amount of ETH staked by all validators on the network. A validator with 32 ETH staked would have a probability of approximately 0.0001024 of being chosen to propose a block in each slot.\n\nThe probability of being chosen to vote on a block equals the validator's stake divided by the total amount of ETH staked by all validators participating in the current epoch. An epoch is a fixed period of time in which validators are assigned to committees. A validator with 32 ETH staked would have a probability of approximately 0.0006075 of being chosen to vote on a block in each slot.\n\n\n\nStaking-as-a-Service\n\nStaking-as-a-service is when you delegate your staking rights to a third-party service provider who manages the validator node and staking process on your behalf, such as a crypto exchange or wallet. Pooled staking similarly involves delegating your ETH to a group of validators who are responsible for running the nodes, but you combine your ETH with other stakers to pool resources and share rewards.\n\n\n\nStaking-as-a-service and pooled staking are less technical options that don't require setting up a validator node and managing keys. Still, they involve surrendering some control, introducing counterparty risk, and potentially sharing personally identifying information (PII) with the service provider. You may need to provide your full legal name, date of birth, government-issued identification, physical address, email address, and phone number to comply with Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures.\n\nA number of crypto wallets and exchanges support staking-as-a-service and pooled staking. Centralized crypto exchanges offering native ETH staking include Coinbase, MetaMask, and Kraken. Decentralized crypto exchanges include Lido Finance, Rocket Pool, and StakerDAO. Crypto wallets comprise hot wallets and cold wallets and include many of the brands running top exchanges, Ledger, Trezor, and KeepKey. Once you have a wallet or an exchange account, you can transfer ETH to it to start staking.\n\n\n\nBenefits of Ethereum Staking\n\nEthereum staking allows you to passively earn income on your ETH holdings simply by locking up your existing ether cryptocurrency. These rewards are distributed periodically and have the potential to appreciate if the ETH's price goes up. The amount of rewards depends on the amount of ETH you stake, the length of time you stake it, and the overall staking activity on the network.\n\nEthereum staking gives you the right to participate in network governance decisions and strengthens the network's security by incentivizing validators to act responsibly and honestly. Validators can vote on proposed changes to the protocol, such as upgrades or new features. A participatory model ensures that the Ethereum network remains responsive to the needs of its users and stakeholders.\n\nEthereum staking contributes to the network's scalability and environmental friendliness by replacing energy-intensive computer mining with the less resource-demanding process of human validation. PoS eliminates PoW's need for massive amounts of electricity and specialized mining hardware, which is difficult to reuse or recycle at the end of its life cycle.\n\nStaking lowers the barrier to entry for participating in the Ethereum network's consensus process. Unlike mining, which required specialized hardware and technical expertise, staking can be done by anyone with an Ethereum wallet and a small amount of ETH tokens. Ethereum staking promotes decentralization and democratizes participation in network governance.\n\nThe estimated annual percentage rate (APR) for ETH staking, as of November 2023, is around 3.9% and calculated using a mathematical formula.\n\nRisks of Ethereum Staking\n\nStaking ETH comes with potential volatility, illiquidity, technical issues, and financial penalties. The price of ETH could drop or the validator could stop working as intended due to malfunctions, errors, and hacks, causing you to lose some of your investment. Your staked ETH will be locked up for the duration of the staking period, and you will not be able to access it during that time. Your staked ETH could be fined or slashed if you don't vote, go offline, or behave maliciously.\n\nIn the Ethereum network, validators who miss head, source, and target voting deadlines face penalties equal to the rewards they would have received had they submitted their votes. Head, source, and target votes are crucial aspects of the PoS consensus mechanism and play a significant role in approving new blocks in the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHead vote : A validator's attestation on the most recent block they believe to be the tip of the chain. This vote signifies the validator's agreement with the current state of the blockchain. By casting a head vote, validators finalize the most recent blocks, making them irreversible.\n\n: A validator's attestation on the most recent block they believe to be the tip of the chain.

Source vote : A validator's attestation of the most recent justified checkpoint of the chain. A checkpoint is a snapshot of the blockchain at a specific point in time. Justified checkpoints represent blocks that have been sufficiently finalized and are unlikely to be reverted. Source votes help establish that checkpoints are justified.\n\n: A validator's attestation of the most recent justified checkpoint of the chain.

Source votes help establish that checkpoints are justified. Target vote: A validator's attestation on the first block of the current epoch. An epoch is a fixed period of time in which validators are assigned to committees. Target votes help to ensure that all validators are on the same page regarding the start of the current epoch.\n\nSlashing is a severe penalty in which a validator is removed altogether from the Ethereum network and loses their staked ETH. Slashing can occur when a validator behaves maliciously by proposing and signing two different blocks for the same slot, attesting to a block that surrounds another block, or double voting for two candidates for the same block.\n\nProposing and signing two different blocks for the same slot : The act of a validator submitting two conflicting block proposals for the same slot in the chain. This behavior creates a fork in the chain, jeopardizing the network's consensus and potentially leading to double spending attacks.\n\n: The act of a validator submitting two conflicting block proposals for the same slot in the chain.

Double voting by attesting to two candidates for the same block: The act of a validator attesting to two different validators as the proposers of the same block. This behavior creates ambiguity regarding the block's proposer and could undermine the network's consensus mechanism.\n\n\n\nWhen a validator is slashed, 1/32 of their staked ETH is immediately burned, permanently destroying it from the Ethereum network, while a 36-day removal period gradually removes their remaining staked ETH. The dual penalty structure of slashing is designed to punish the validator for misbehavior, deter others from doing the same, and prevent the validator from immediately rejoining the network and continuing to cause problems.\n\nHalfway through the removal period, an additional penalty, the \"correlation penalty,\" is applied. The correlation penalty is designed to discourage validators from colluding to slash each other. The magnitude of the correlation penalty scales upward with the total staked ETH of all slashed validators in the 36 days prior to the slashing event.\n\n\n\nFactors to Consider When Choosing a Staking Method\n\nDeposit requirements, staking fees, coding ability, service provider quality, hardware costs, and cybersecurity are important when choosing how and where to stake Ethereum. We discuss some of these factors below.\n\nDeposit Requirements : Minimum deposit requirements influence the flexibility of staking strategies. Higher minimum deposits may require longer staking periods to break even and take away capital from an investment portfolio. Lower minimum deposits may encourage shorter staking periods and free up capital allocations for other investment areas.\n\n: Minimum deposit requirements influence the flexibility of staking strategies.

Quality Assurance : A high-quality wallet or exchange with a strong track record of software engineering and product development can provide added security and peace of mind when staking, especially if you are locking up a huge amount of ETH. Larger companies tend to have stronger talent and standards than smaller upstarts that run staking services.\n\n: A high-quality wallet or exchange with a strong track record of software engineering and product development can provide added security and peace of mind when staking, especially if you are locking up a huge amount of ETH.

While some aspects of the setup can be done through graphical user interfaces, some steps require command-line interactions and familiarity with coding concepts. Hardware Costs: For solo staking, you must purchase and maintain specialized hardware, such as a validator node. The upfront hardware cost and ongoing maintenance can be significant, ranging in the thousands of dollars.\n\nStaking Independently\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps to run an Ethereum validator node on your own:\n\nPurchase the hardware. Consistently reliable hardware for solo staking typically includes a powerful computer with a high-performance CPU such as an Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7, ample RAM of 32GB or more to support the demanding staking software, sufficient storage of at least 2TB SSD to store the entire Ethereum blockchain, and a stable Internet connection with high bandwidth and low latency. Install the necessary software. The software for Ethereum staking includes the Ethereum client, validator client, and any additional tools, typically involves downloading and compiling the software from source code or using package managers like apt or yum. This requires some familiarity with command-line environments and basic Linux/Unix commands. Configure the validator node. Edit the node's configuration files, set up its network settings, and generate its cryptographic keys. This requires understanding the structure of configuration files, syntax of specific commands, and the usage of tools like \"geth\" and \"geth attach\" for interacting with the Ethereum network. Monitor and maintain the validator node. Check logs, update software, troubleshoot issues, and ensure consistent uptime. This requires familiarity with log analysis tools, understanding error messages, and applying software updates through command-line tools or package managers.\n\nStaking Via Cryptocurrency Exchanges\n\nHere are the steps to stake Ethereum via a crypto exchange:"

        "title": "Ethereum ETF: How BlackRock's Proposal Affects Crypto's Outlook - U.S News & World Report Money",
        "content": "At $9.4 trillion in assets under management, U.S. investment behemoth BlackRock Inc. (ticker: BLK) is the largest money manager in the world.\n\nJust about all of that money percolates in traditional financial market channels, like stock, bonds, funds, currencies, derivatives, real estate and commodities. For years, nary a word was spoken (to the masses, at least) about BlackRock steering mountains of cash into cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nBut if you look closely, hints have been dropped about the investment firm's rising interest in crypto in the past few years.\n\nA case in point: In November 2020, Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, said Bitcoin had the potential to \"take the place of gold to a large extent.\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has also weighed in on crypto, noting that original crypto Bitcoin (BTC) was resonating with the public and may one day create its own global market. In December 2020, BlackRock left another crypto clue, advertising for a vice president of blockchain who would ostensibly drive \"strategies designed to drive demand for the firm's offerings.\"\n\nBlackRock's Bid for a Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nBlackRock announced in November 2023 that it filed for a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund, and with that action the company's cryptocurrency vision has begun to crystalize. After all, it wouldn't roll out a new crypto ETF if it didn't believe in the market where it operates, would it?\n\nBlackRock is not the only horse in the race for the first spot Ethereum ETF, however. Asset manager Grayscale Investments, which recently won a landmark legal victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its bid to move a spot Bitcoin ETF into fruition, is also pursuing a spot Ethereum ETF. On Dec. 5, the SEC gave itself an extension to reach a decision or extend the deadline for the ETH ETF until January 2024.\n\nBlackRock filed for its iShares Ethereum Trust to be listed on the Nasdaq and proposes to turn it into a spot ETF. Days later, Fidelity put in its own application for a spot Ethereum ETF, and at least five other top investment houses are now also in the running.\n\nThe SEC has yet to give the nod to either a spot Bitcoin or a spot Ethereum ETF, which would directly own Bitcoin and Ether rather than futures tied to the cryptos. There are several popular ETFs already in existence linked to cryptocurrency futures.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Appears Poised for Approval\n\nBlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF application is also in the works, as are talks between the SEC, Grayscale, Fidelity and others that have filed spot Bitcoin ETFs and progressed into a discussion of technical details, an indication that they may soon be approved, according to a Dec. 7 Reuters report.\n\nWhat's not as clear is what these high-profile entries into the market mean for cryptocurrency investors, prices, and public policy risk and regulation oversight.\n\nIndustry investment experts say that it should mean a shot in the arm for crypto in the short term \u2013 and maybe a lot more.\n\n\"Companies like BlackRock recognize the potential for market growth and the opportunity to profit from it,\" says Adam Berker, senior legal counsel at global payments platform Mercuryo. \"Consequently, they aim to be the first to penetrate the market and secure an advantage. Moreover, they already possess the necessary infrastructure, funds and investors to succeed and influence the further development of the crypto industry, given their heavy weight in the financial industry.\"\n\nEven more significantly, BlackRock's Ethereum ETF move could be seen as a new phase in the crypto industry's evolution. \"Large institutional investment funds are entering the market, prepared to invest their clients' money and influence the market's direction,\" Berker says.\n\n\"The foray of institutional giants like BlackRock into the crypto market signifies the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies as an asset class,\" says Nic Puckrin, CEO and co-founder of Coin Bureau, a cryptocurrency education platform. \"This strategic interest from large capital allocators signals a positive endorsement of the crypto industry, highlighting its growing acceptance and recognizing its potential for traditional hedge funds and investors.\"\n\n\n\nHow Would a Spot Ethereum ETF Impact Markets?\n\nWho benefits the most and who absorbs the largest risk regarding BlackRock's proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF? While nothing is guaranteed in the often-volatile cryptocurrency market, here's an \"impact\" list:\n\nImplications for the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nCrypto industry experts say BlackRock's potential introduction of a spot Ethereum ETF should drive the market forward significantly. BlackRock and Fidelity applying for spot crypto ETFs, as opposed to crypto futures ETFs, sends a message to the financial world that cryptocurrencies as an investment vehicle have matured to the point that established institutions feel comfortable diving in.\n\nIf a BlackRock or Fidelity spot crypto ETF rolls out, the floodgates could open, allowing billions of dollars of new capital to have access to this uncorrelated asset class. So, in short, prices could go up.\n\nEffect on Cryptocurrency Risk\n\nWhile it's no secret that cryptocurrency is volatile, having the BlackRock brand and other big names in the crypto market should provide some price stability, experts say, as the relatively small pool of crypto owners expands to give access to more people.\n\nIn the case of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF, for example, Galaxy Research estimates that the addressable market size would be roughly $14 trillion in the first year after its launch, reaching $39 trillion by its third year. That's a lot more crypto investors having a much bigger hand in the direction of assets.\n\nImpact on Cryptocurrency Prices\n\nCrypto experts generally view the BlackRock ETF play as a positive one across the board, price-wise.\n\n\"We can expect major cryptocurrency prices to spike in the short term,\" says Habeeb Syed, an associate attorney at Sutter Law PC, which regularly services blockchain clients. \"Medium to long term, expect sustained increases in BTC and ETH with the normal consequential rises in other crypto as the market sees an influx of value based on the two major cryptocurrencies.\"\n\nThat rise has already started, as Bitcoin's price popped above $44,000 late last week, and retreated just below $42,000 as of the morning of Dec. 11.\n\nOther professional cryptocurrency trackers concur, noting the \"trust\" issue leans toward the market with a BlackRock presence.\n\n\"Although we don't like to speculate on price action, we do believe that the crypto ETFs will have a positive impact on the industry and market overall,\" says Nathan Leung, a crypto educator and lead content creator at Cryptonauts, a YouTube platform that covers blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\n\nA stable level of trust from retail investors is extremely important because they are the key to mass adoption, Leung notes.\n\n\"Everyone has heard of crypto at this point, including your aunt and grandmother at family gatherings,\" he says. \"But their perception of crypto varies, and the sentiment is mostly negative surrounding our industry. An ETF approval would boost the level of trust immensely, having a domino effect on the rest of the market.\"\n\nWhat Risk Is BlackRock Taking With a Spot Ethereum ETF?\n\nThe biggest risk BlackRock faces is their ETF investors thinking they can stomach a 50% drawdown but then getting squeamish and pulling out at the bottom, causing negative sentiment toward BlackRock and the asset class as a whole, experts say.\n\nHowever, BlackRock entering the fold may mark a level of maturity for the industry, limiting future drawdowns to normal percentages akin to real estate investment trusts and small-cap stocks.\n\nWhat a Spot Ethereum ETF Means for the Second-Largest Crypto\n\nOften languishing in the shadow of Bitcoin, Ethereum could find its time to shine, but there are caveats.\n\n\"Ethereum is just the next big thing after Bitcoin and one of the assets in the space least likely to be classified as a security given its decentralized nature and active and widespread use,\" Syed says. \"If you're putting in the time and money to start an ETF, you don't want those efforts wiped out by a surprise SEC ruling.\"\n\nYet, with a green light from regulators, Ethereum could significantly benefit from its Fidelity or BlackRock ETF connection.\n\n\"Ethereum, the second-largest and most widely recognized cryptocurrency following Bitcoin, presents a valuable platform for BlackRock to enter this market,\" Berker says. \"Beyond its recognition, Ethereum provides substantial liquidity.\"\n\nThat means investment funds can purchase Ether in advance to establish a liquid reserve. \"When they decide to act, this reserve guarantees a robust market for transactions, offering an advantage over other altcoins,\" Berker notes.\n\nImpact of Spot Crypto ETFs on Everyday Investors\n\nBig moves from big investment firms have a ripple effect on Main Street investors, and BlackRock's new Ethereum ETF should be no different.\n\nAs with any investment, retail investors should keep a cool head if a spot Bitcoin or Ethereum ETF goes live. \"While the news about ETF approval will positively affect the development of the crypto market, it is also vital to consider the progression and continuity of such news,\" Berker says.\n\nMany investors will understandably assume that after a spot ETF has been approved, the price will be going up. But that's not necessarily the case."

        "title": "Ethereum faces a moment of truth with latest crypto rally - Fortune",
        "content": "In early December, the sudden popularity of a new species of NFT called Buterin Cards led Ethereum gas fees\u2014the cost to carry out a transaction on the blockchain\u2014to briefly soar to around $10. Even though the fees soon fell back to around $1, the episode was an unpleasant reminder of earlier crypto booms when Ethereum became practically unusable just as it was soaring in popularity. This famously occurred with the arrival of an early NFT package known as Crypto Kitties in 2017, and with the massive speculative frenzy of the 2021 crypto bubble.\n\nDuring those earlier episodes, Ethereum boosters begged for understanding since the blockchain, which was the first to popularize smart contracts, was still a new technology. The crypto world was largely understanding since growing pains for a project of this scale are inevitable, and due to the specific challenge of the \u201cblockchain trilemma\u201d\u2014an axiom that says it is easy to build for two of the three qualities of speed, security, and decentralization but not all three. As we appear to be entering a new crypto bull market, though, it\u2019s not clear if people will be as patient.\n\nThe frustration around gas fees is partly a financial one\u2014no one likes to pay more than they expect. But it\u2019s also rooted in a philosophical disconnect: The promise of Ethereum is that it\u2019s supposed to be a cheaper and safer technology than the conventional financial system. The reality for many people who first try Ethereum, however, is that the proposed gas cost exceeds the cost of the underlying transaction.\n\nI asked Paul Brody, an Ernst & Young executive who has written a well-reviewed book titled Ethereum for Business, to see if he is concerned that the blockchain\u2019s ongoing gas headaches might mean it is running out of time to prove it is ready for primetime. He told me he is not, pointing to the flourishing layer-2 ecosystem, which lets users carry out the bulk of transactions on auxiliary blockchains like Optimism at a fraction of the cost. Those transactions are then bundled up and stamped on the main Ethereum blockchain, providing the same immutable record.\n\nLayer-2 technology has indeed grown by leaps and bounds since 2021, spurred in part by Ethereum\u2019s successful switch to a proof-of-stake model for its blockchain, and costs on the side chains are far lower. But as I pointed to Brody, the experience of using a layer-2 chain is still clumsy and complicated, and off-putting to nontechnical people.\n\nBrody acknowledged that the L2 experience remains \u201cabsolutely horrible\u201d but says this is only a temporary situation, and that it won\u2019t be long until it becomes abstracted away with better designs. Meanwhile, he added that Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract for companies by an order of magnitude, and that this growth will only continue\u2014a refutation of claims by Solana and other rivals that tout their lower gas costs as proof they can replace Ethereum.\n\nFor now, Brody appears right that Ethereum remains in the pole position when it comes to being the world\u2019s go-to smart contract platform. That said, if the next crypto boom is once again defined by eye-popping Ethereum fees, patience will begin to run out.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe SEC asked a Washington, D.C., court to incorporate admissions included in Binance's recent settlement with the DOJ, claiming they strengthen its ongoing case.

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Drop As Traders Get Liquidated -- Is The Market Headed For a Reversal? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nOver $400 million worth of positions liquidated in the last 24 hours across BTC and ETH.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum decreased by 11% as key resistance was reached.\n\nA Bull market correction might have started.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin reached $45,000 on December 5 and stayed there until yesterday, December 10, when it made a downturn. It fell to $40,335 at its lowest point as the week began, marking a decrease of 11%. On the other hand, Ethereum made its yearly high of $2,400 on December 9 after a downturn to $2,145, which is an 11% decrease as well.\n\nConsequently, we saw a larger amount of long positions getting liquidated. According to CoinGlass data, in the past 24 hours, 113,881 traders were liquidated, and the total liquidations came in at $403.96 million.\n\nMost were long positions with $348.62 million compared to only $55.52 million. With the prices getting overextended in the previous period and now seeing significant declines, is this an early sign of market weakness?\n\nBTC Price Analysis\n\nThe price of Bitcoin rose by 76% since its September 11 low of around $25,000. This is the start of the ending wave from the larger uptrend that started on November 21 last year.\n\nIn our previous analysis, we called for an interaction with the $45,000 area as the next significant resistance, and judging by today\u2019s rejection, it has proven to serve as such. Analyzing the wave structure in the last advancement from November 6, it seems there might be another minor attempt to continue its upward trajectory.\n\nIt came slightly short from the interaction with the level, so an upward spike above it would look likely, but it ended as a wick and quickly snapped back below it. The rise ended as it is, and now the first bull phase correction has started.\n\nIn any case, this correction will be awaited shortly, and from the current downward movement, we will see if it has already begun. This ABC correction should bring the price of Bitcoin to the $25,000 area optimally but could go lower.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nWhat\u2019s been said for Bitcoin applies to Ethereum as well. Its price was in an ascending structure from June 18 last year and most likely marked the completion of the leading diagonal, moving upward in a five-wave manner.\n\nDecember 9 high was an interaction with its ascending resistance level and ended as a rejection, displaying the same behavior as it did on two previous occasions. There could be another minor high ahead, but this chance is slim.\n\nMore likely, we saw the completion of this larger uptrend, and it is now headed to its first bull-significant correction. If so, ETH could now be sent to the $1,500 area in an ABC correction or to $1,400 if it reaches its optimal Fibonacci retracement level of 0.618.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has continuously grown since November last year and recovered significantly, showing promising signs of a starting bull market. However, before it can continue sustainably, it must establish higher support and form its first higher low.\n\nThese higher lows are the corrections we have outlined in our price chart analysis and are referred to as higher price points compared to the lows of November last year when the larger uptrend started.\n\nAs the prices are getting overextended and we are approaching the holiday season, the euphoria might cause the market to continue or attempt to rise for another push, but these corrections are imminent.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "Ethereum price took a major hit like Bitcoin and dropped over $350. ETH tested the $2,000 support and is currently attempting a fresh increase.\n\nEthereum declined over 8% and broke the $2,200 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $2,340 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise again unless there is a close below the $2,100 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Took A Major Hit\n\nEthereum price climbed further higher above the $2,300 level. ETH even cleared the $2,350 level but the bears remained active near the $2,400 zone. A high was formed near $2,401 and there was a sharp decline like Bitcoin.\n\nThe price declined over 8% and there was a move below the $2,200 level. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $2,340 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even spiked below the $2,000 support before the bulls appeared.\n\nA low was formed near $1,980 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $2,150 and $2,180 levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,401 swing high to the $1,980 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,275 zone. The next key resistance is near the $2,300 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,401 swing high to the $1,980 low. A clear move above the $2,300 zone could send the price toward the $2,400 level. The next resistance sits at $2,450. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,500 level.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,300 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,180 level.\n\nThe next key support is $2,120. The main support is now near $2,100. A downside break below $2,200 might start an extended decline. The key support is now at $2,000, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $1,880 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 30 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,100\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,300\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "This week\u2019s Web3 watch begins with a significant shift in the NFT marketplace. Ethereum, traditionally the frontrunner in NFT trading, has seen a downturn in sales volume, facing competition from two emerging players.\n\nThe Bitcoin network witnessed a surge in digital art collectible trading, primarily driven by ongoing interest in ordinal inscriptions. Ordinals allow users to mint NFT-like assets directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. The past month has seen a 500% increase in sales volume for this asset class, eclipsing Ethereum\u2019s figures over the same timeframe.\n\nThe popularity of Bitcoin\u2019s cheap-to-mint ordinal inscriptions has led to a significant increase in demand on the network. This trend reflects a broader shift in the digital collectibles market, where novel and cost-effective methods of NFT creation and trading are gaining traction.\n\nRead more: Sotheby\u2019s announces its first Bitcoin Ordinals sale\n\nThe Solana blockchain has also stepped into the spotlight, recording higher NFT trading volumes than Ethereum on Friday. This increase in Solana\u2019s trading volume is the culmination of a banner week for the network.\n\n\u201cSomething that\u2019s obviously interesting and different in the ordinals space versus every other popular blockchain is that your NFTs are actually stored on-chain versus in smart contracts-enabled ecosystems, [where] they\u2019re stored on some decentralized server like IPFS,\u201d Sarah Satoshi, the head of business development at ordinals marketplace Gamma.io, said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the factors that attracts a lot of people.\u201d\n\nLiquid staking protocol Jito executed an airdrop on Thursday, distributing $165 million worth of its native token to users. The following day, Solana saw a spike in its NFT sales, processing nearly $15 million in transactions.\n\nThere was a marked increase in activity on Tensor, a Solana-based NFT market, which may have been fueled by speculations of another potential airdrop.\n\nOn Friday, \u201cTensorians,\u201d a Solana-based NFT collection, topped the sales volume charts according to CryptoSlam. The collection\u2019s sales volume rose over 100% in the past week.\n\nPudgy Penguins takes up the Webkinz model\n\nThe NFT collection Pudgy Penguins debuted an online open-world game called Pudgy World Alpha at Art Basel Miami.\n\nThe game lets players control avatar lookalikes of the penguins, but users don\u2019t need to own an NFT to play.\n\nPudgy World builds on the NFT collection\u2019s partnership bringing toy versions of Pudgy Penguins to Walmart stores. Each toy comes with a QR code that claims a Pudgy Penguin character inside of Pudgy World.\n\nEvery toy corresponds to a Pudgy Penguins NFT, and holders receive licensing royalties on their corresponding toys, the project said in a press statement.\n\nOne interesting stat:\n\nInterest in Bitcoin ordinals dramatically increased the blockchain\u2019s mempool to an all-time high. Mempools collect all unconfirmed transactions waiting to be validated and added to a blockchain. When too many transactions are added, it becomes congested, leading to slower processing times and higher fees for prioritizing transactions.\n\nAlso of note:\n\nRecordpool released the Jackson 5\u2019s first ever studio recording as a digital collectible on Web3 music marketplace anotherblock.\n\nThe digital art arm of Sotheby\u2019s is auctioning off its first set of ordinal inscriptions.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum continue to experience price drops in recent hours, marking a bearish start to the week. While this could be a standard correction ahead of a bull run, similar to patterns observed in past bull markets, there is growing worry about whale investors selling for profit, potentially postponing the anticipated bull phase. Ethereum, in particular, is facing increased liquidations and is approaching a critical support level to test.\n\nETH Price Prepares To Test $2,100\n\nAccording to Coinglass, there has been a significant increase in the liquidation of long positions as the price of Ethereum fell sharply from $2,250. In the past three hours alone, long positions valued at over $6.6 million were liquidated as investor confidence declined following the drop from $2,250. In the same vein, Bitcoin also experienced over $15 million in long position liquidations, indicating an ongoing sell-off and the potential for further price declines.\n\nInterest from whale investors in Ethereum has declined, with large-scale transactions reaching a one-month low. IntoTheBlock reports a sharp decrease in the number of large transactions, following the downturn in Ethereum\u2019s price. Currently, this metric stands at around 2.65K transactions.\n\nInterestingly, as Ethereum\u2019s price drops, some investors see this as an opportune moment to increase their holdings. Data from CryptoQuant shows that Ethereum\u2019s Netflow is negative, indicating that the outflow of coins from exchanges is exceeding the inflow. This trend suggests that despite the falling prices, exchange reserves of Ethereum are declining as investors withdraw their ETH to start holding from the recent dip.\n\nThis trend could notably strengthen the immediate support levels as Ethereum\u2019s price approaches a test of the $2100 mark. At present, the market sentiment is largely bearish, as indicated by the long/short ratio standing at 0.8692. This shows that 53.5% of positions are anticipating a decrease in price. On the other hand, 46.5% of positions remain bullish, maintaining a bullish outlook despite the increasing selling pressure.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nThere is an attempt by bearish traders to push Ethereum\u2019s price below the critical breakout level of $2,200, but the bullish investors are defending this level. This indicates an effort by buyers to establish $2,200 as a new support level.\n\nThe ETH price is flashing extreme volatility near $2.2K as buyers attempt to send the price above EMA20. To regain positions, ETH price needs to hold within $2,400 and break above the resistance at $2,464. However, sellers are expected to defend this level aggressively.\n\nThe key support zone to watch is between $2,200 and $2,100. A decline below this support zone could trap some of the more aggressive bullish traders, potentially leading to a wave of long position liquidations. Such a scenario could trigger a sharp correction, possibly driving the price down toward $1,900."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) just experienced its greatest price wick in nearly two years, destroying millions of open positions. This rapid price movement resulted in a staggering $82 million worth of long position liquidations, marking it as one of the most wild moves on the market since the onset of the bull run.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe price chart of Ethereum displays a stark long wick dipping down, an uncommon sight that indicates a violent shift in price over a very short period. This wick represents a severe, rapid price drop followed by an equally swift recovery, which often leads to a significant number of traders being caught off guard, with their positions liquidated as the market rapidly moves against them.\n\nSo, what led to this dramatic market movement?\n\nFirst, a liquidity crunch can precipitate such a situation. In a market where many traders are positioned on the long side, a sudden drive to sell can trigger a cascade of liquidations due to a lack of immediate buy orders at current or slightly lower levels, causing the price to plummet until it hits a level where liquidity is available.\n\nSecond, a long squeeze may occur when the market is heavily biased toward long positions. If the market begins to turn, those with leveraged long positions may be forced to sell to cover their positions, thus amplifying the downward price pressure.\n\nThe unexpected nature of this wick caught thousands of traders by surprise, resulting in massive losses for those with leveraged positions. However, the aftermath of the wick saw a spike in buying power, indicating that many investors saw this as a buying opportunity, thereby pushing the price back to a relatively stable zone.\n\nEthereum is known for its volatility, but a wick of this magnitude is a rare occurrence even for a cryptocurrency market. Investors might consider staying less leveraged in order to safeguard themselves from such dramatic swings."

Whales have been actively taking profit, and this could trigger a massive sell pressure on the world\u2019s second-largest crypto.\n\nEthereum price volatility\n\nThe price of Ethereum has been positively impacted by the recent bullish momentum in the global crypto markets, fueled by Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) surge above the $43,000 price region.\n\nETH maintains a distinctive market position attributed to its extensive developer community, widespread adoption, and pivotal role in decentralized finance (defi) and various blockchain applications.\n\nDespite the current positive momentum, there are apprehensions regarding the potential influence of selling pressure from whales on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, whales immediately took profits after Ethereum hit $2,300.\n\nThe impact of significant holders selling could potentially drive down the price of ETH in the coming weeks. In a bearish scenario, the cryptocurrency might retest the $1,555 support level, and sustained selling pressure could push ETH as low as $1,460 within the next two months, the analyst predicts.\n\nDespite these concerns, the overall market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, leaving room for potential further growth in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nAs #Ethereum surpassed $2,300, $ETH whales began to book profits. This surge in selling pressure might soon start to impact the #ETH price. pic.twitter.com/sdrvT2vcCe \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 10, 2023\n\nAlthough Ether\u2019s market capitalization of $282 billion lags behind Bitcoin\u2019s $857 billion, both networks generate comparable protocol revenues.\n\nIn the last seven days, the Bitcoin network accrued $61 million in fees, while Ethereum accumulated $61.5 million.\n\nIn addition to institutional interest, the price surge is fueled by expectations of an ETF approval from the SEC. Despite the optimistic momentum, there are apprehensions, that the upswing in selling pressure might have repercussions on the ETH price in the coming days.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum scaling startup Versace Labs secured another $2.3m in seed round\n\nEthereum\u2019s surging network fees\n\nThe rise in Ethereum\u2019s network fees is intricately tied to the expansion of its DeFi ecosystem and the widespread adoption of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nIncreased defi and NFT activities have driven up network fees, with more individuals engaging in intricate transactions, leading to prolonged periods of elevated fees.\n\nThe creation, transfer, and trading of NFTs involve smart contract executions that consume gas, and the associated costs can fluctuate based on network congestion and gas prices. While Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees pose challenges for NFT creators and collectors, emerging solutions like Layer 2 scaling and gas optimization provide optimism for a more cost-effective and accessible NFT ecosystem.\n\nThe surge in DeFi and NFT activity on the Ethereum network since 2020 has resulted in extensive transaction activity, contributing to the persistently high gas fees.\n\nCurrently, the average gas fee for minting an NFT on Ethereum is around $100, subject to variations based on network congestion, gas prices, and smart contract complexity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,348.23, according to Data from CoinGecko.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe integrity of the Ethereum blockchain network is under threat after Truth Labs conducted a thorough investigation and discovered multiple fraudulent activities within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDriven by growing concerns about security, the investigation uncovered a startling pattern of illicit activities, such as theft, scams, and dishonest marketing.\n\nWe began our deep research into Ethereum when it became far to dangerous to participate in the ecosystem with any relevant % of my wealth. Fraud was running rampant in every Sector of the Ecosystem. Wallets, Layer 2's, Bridge's, Protocols across the board using ERC20 Standard,\u2026 \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) November 14, 2023\n\nThe investigation conducted by Truth Labs showed that these illegal activities are present in many areas of the Ethereum platform. Among the areas affected are wallets, bridges, Layer 2 solutions, and protocols that use the ERC20 standard. Moreover, stablecoins, wrapped tokens, NFT-selling protocols, and both centralized and decentralized exchanges have yet to be spared.\n\nIn addition, the Truth Labs report has clouded the reputations of notable Ethereum community members. There have been allegations of pump-and-dump schemes, which has led to concerns about the moral character of these influential individuals. The discussion about these people\u2019s accountability for opposing and combating such dishonest practices has been spurred by this circumstance.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Truth Labs\u2019 findings go beyond ideas. An actor and wallet network disproportionately connected to fraudulent activity on Ethereum has been found and documented. Understanding and possibly preventing the spread of such malpractices within the ecosystem is made possible by using this database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, these revelations have numerous ramifications. They have rekindled conversations about the necessity of ethics and transparency in the crypto space, particularly among Ethereum users. These days, the main worries are about the platform\u2019s overall integrity and the safety of funds.\n\nFurther raising concerns is the fact that some influential individuals involved in these schemes are anonymous. It highlights the difficulties in policing and overseeing a decentralized and frequently opaque digital environment. One of the biggest obstacles to solving the problems ailing the Ethereum ecosystem is this lack of transparency.\n\nAs such, there is a fork in the road for the Ethereum community. As a result of Truth Labs\u2019 disclosures, there is now a need for a coordinated effort to tackle the network\u2019s vulnerabilities and illegal activities. According to the report, leaders and influencers in the Ethereum community must promote a more open and moral environment."

However, this improved sentiment could soon be derailed by new development updates on Ethereum.\n\nA slight delay\n\nThey recently decided to delay the deployment of the Cancun upgrade.\n\nThis was done when Ethereum developers recently met for their 176th gathering, discussing upgrades to make Ethereum better. They\u2019re currently testing the Cancun/Deneb upgrade, aiming to make Ethereum more efficient and secure.\n\nAfter the holidays, in mid-January, they plan to activate it on the Goerli test network.\n\ngm, eth devs decided yesterday to push cancun/deneb activation on the goerli testnet to jan. why this matters: assuming public testnet forks are spaced at least 2 weeks apart, there's a high chance now that mainnet activation of cancun likely won't happen until march and some\u2026 \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) December 8, 2023\n\nTests begin\n\nRight now, the Ethereum team is actively testing the upgrade on Devnet #12, a kind of playground.\n\nThey\u2019re also working on testing a mechanism called MEV (Maximal Extractable Value), making sure validators are fairly compensated.\n\nIn this upgrade, the team is introducing something called the builder override flag. It\u2019s like a tool that helps signal if something\u2019s wrong and validators need to switch to a safer way of making blocks.\n\nIt\u2019s a way to make the network safer and more efficient.

        "title": "NFTs Are Dead? Solana Outpaces Ethereum for NFT Sales - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nSolana has been a big beneficiary of the wider crypto resurgence recently.\n\nPrices have boomed since the middle of October across most high-profile digital assets.\n\nNow that Solana success looks to be translating into more NFT sales.\n\nIn a dramatic twist, the Solana (SOL) network briefly surpassed Ethereum (ETH) in total non-fungible token (NFT) sales volume on Friday, marking a notable, if temporary, shift in the market.\n\nFor seasoned crypto veterans, Ethereum dominating the NFT space seemed an immutable law of the industry. Yet Solana\u2019s surprise performance raises questions about Ethereum\u2019s place as the dominant smart contract and NFT platform.\n\nA Good Week for Solana NFTs\n\nSparked by skyrocketing sales from the \u201cTensorians\u201d NFT collection, Solana saw trading activity that catapulted it past Ethereum for the first time since June. Coming on the heels of Solana\u2019s 75% increase in total value locked in DeFi protocols last month, this achievement signals a network whose comeback is outperforming the wider crypto industry.\n\nAnd Solana isn\u2019t alone in this revival. The entire NFT industry appears poised for growth following the tremors that rocked the crypto world last year. According to DappRadar\u2019s November report, monthly NFT trading volumes just hit $994 million globally \u2013 a 125% surge from October. Driving this boom are Solana-based collections like Tensorians, BONKz and Mad Lads. As well as a significant uptick in Bitcoin Ordinals \u2013 BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.\n\nBut while the sales headlines are grabbing attention, data from DappRadar reveals a behavioral shift rumbling through the NFT market: increased buying, but at higher prices. The average transaction value recently doubled, suggesting traders feel buoyant bidding up works rather than chasing quantity.\n\nHowever, the NFT market is highly dependent on the health of digital assets elsewhere. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, is up approximately 56% since the middle of October, when the latest market rally began. SOL meanwhile, has pumped 209% in the same time. So, perhaps its no wonder Solana NFTs are having their moment in the sun.\n\nA Big Change from Pear Bear and Peak Bull Market\n\nThis flowering of NFT trade stands in stark contrast to the crypto winter of 2022 that left traders out in the cold. NFT sales hit a peak in January last year before crypto markets nosedived, triggering widespread panic in the long-term viability of non-fungible tokens.\n\nBut while the market is seeing a resurgence, it is in no way comparable to the halcyon days of 2021 and early 2022, when the price of non-fungible tokens commanded news attention outside the crypto space. In January 2022, the NFT market totaled a record-breaking $16 billion in sales, although 60% of it originated from artificial trading on LooksRare, according to DappRadar .\n\nSince the cooling-off, NFTs have largely lost their luster. Celebrities like Madonna and Justin Bieber, who once proudly wore their blue chip Bored Apes, now have little to say about the phenomenon, partly because of an ongoing legal case . By-and-large, NFT trading and collecting is still a very niche pursuit.\n\nThings could still change, however. 2023 has seen the crypto market make something of a resurgence. Optimists believe 2024 could do the same for NFTs."

Further, the Ethereum Classic price has lost over 10% in value within the past 24 hours, making it one of the top losers for the day.\n\nThe ETC price traded in a closed space between $16.63 and $17.71 for a week, following which the price gained momentum, resulting in a breakout.

        "content": "Recent patterns indicate that the impetus fueling Ethereum\u2019s climb is far from diminishing, and the price trajectory of the cryptocurrency has shown resilience. Ethereum may not be as advanced as some of its L1 competitors, but it stands out from the crowd thanks to its large developer community, immense acceptance, and crucial role in DeFi and other blockchain-based applications.\n\nEthereum Remains Firm At $2,347\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was able to keep a strong footing at the $2,300 level, trading at $2,347, nearly unchanged in the last 24 hours, but tallied a 10% increase in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows.\n\nThere is still a lot of room for profit in the current bull market, even though Ethereum\u2019s price spike hasn\u2019t been as dramatic as other altcoin\u2019s. Size, liquidity, and being the leading platform for smart contracts all contribute to Ethereum\u2019s continued appeal as an investment.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,341.6 territory. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nThis means that ETH\u2019s price performance could be greatly enhanced by any further market increases. Ethereum, according to technical research, is about to see growth, and it is now testing key resistance levels. Both retail and institutional investors would be interested if the price breaks out above these levels, as it could indicate that the positive trend would continue.\n\n\ud83d\udc33 #Ethereum has scratched its way to $2,349, its highest level since June, 2022. The long-term trend of top non-exchange whale wallets getting richer, and top exchange whale wallets having less sell-off power, is a promising combo for a continued climb. https://t.co/h7ogbqPLWf pic.twitter.com/82plXmVn02 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 7, 2023\n\nFor the first time in more than a year, Ethereum\u2019s price has moved into a new range. The accumulation patterns seen in several top addresses indicate that this new range has created a chance for persistent price increases.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Growing Holdings And 2024 Roadmap\n\nThe most popular Ethereum addresses on exchanges and those outside of them have shown clear patterns of accumulation in the last several months, according to new data from Santiment.\n\nA large number of top non-exchange addresses have been buying Ethereum at different prices, which has caused their holding volume of ETH to rise steadily and now surpass 54 million.\n\nAt the same time, following their most recent execution layer meeting on December 8, Ethereum developers have laid out a detailed strategy for the network\u2019s future in 2024, including new suggestions, major upgrades, and more.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum is predicted to significantly outpace mega-cap tech stocks. After the Bitcoin miners\u2019 payouts are halved, investment firm VanEck thinks Ethereum will soar. In the past, this has caused a fresh spike in the price of Bitcoin, with the proceeds going into altcoins.\n\nEthereum won\u2019t surpass Bitcoin, despite surpassing large stocks, and what \u201cflippening\u201d rumors claim. It is still believed that Bitcoin will continue to lead in market capitalization even though there is a chance that ETH may gain value in daily transaction volume.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

        "content": "The Ethereum price has been among the worst hit in the flash crash that took place on Monday. The crash sent the asset\u2019s price down below $2,200 for the first time in the last week and has continued to trend low around this point. As the market shows a bit of recovery momentum, questions remain about what could have triggered the crash.\n\nEthereum Price Fell Because Whales Have Been Selling\n\nOne of the most obvious causes of the flash crash that affected the Ethereum price is the fact that large holders have been selling. This month, ETH hit its highest level in the last year and this sent a lot of investors back into profit. Now, since there has not been a complete bullish turnover of the crypto market, there are expectations that the market could crash and investors are trying to secure profits before this happens.\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez flagged the selling from these large holders in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday. According to him, these large holders had actually begun selling when the price had first crossed $2,300. This means that the selling pressure had been mounting for a while before being reflected in the price.\n\nThe whales who hold more than 10,000 ETH in their balances had been reducing their holdings toward the end of November. By December, their holdings had fallen to their lowest point in the last three months, showing proof of massive sell-offs by these whales.\n\nETH price at $2,242 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nUncertainty About Macro Factors\n\nMacroeconomic uncertainty has also played a role in the crypto crash that sent the Ethereum price to $2,200. One example of this is the CPI data release that is expected to take place on Tuesday. As investors eagerly await the results from the announcement, market fluctuations are expected.\n\nThe November inflation data is also expected to be released this week, as well as the Fed\u2019s decision and statement happening on Monday. Ahead of these events, high volatility is always expected as investors move to secure some of their positions.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum has begun to show some bullish momentum once more. It has since bounced from its lows of $2,170 and is back up above $2,000, where bulls are already providing a lot of support. If Bitcoin\u2019s price continues to rise, Ethereum could reclaim the $2,300 level before the day is over.\n\nThe price of ETH is sitting at $2,238 at the time of this writing, down 4.50% in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from Quora, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

According to the announcement, the platform will use this feature to give users free transactions across its ecosystem for three months.\n\nOn Dec. 6, executives working in the gaming industry weighed in on the future of blockchain gaming and highlighted several catalysts to Web3 adoption in gaming. Bartosz Skwarczek, the founder and CEO of G2A Capital Group, told Cointelegraph that improvements in accessibility and user interfaces would attract a broader gamer audience to Web3.\n\nSimilarly, Rene Stefancic, the chief operating officer of Atlas Development Services, a core contributor to the Enjin Blockchain, said that the push to a different blockchain could potentially allow Web3 to \u201ctap into the three billion-strong global gamer market.\u201d\n\nRelated: NFT trading volume nears $1B as markets turn bullish: Report\n\nOscar Franklin Tan, the chief financial officer of Atlas, told Cointelegraph that to avoid an \u201cincredible amount of gas fees\u201d for transferring over 200 million NFTs, the platform has taken a different approach with their migration. Tan said:\n\n\u201cTo avoid the incredible amount of gas fees for 200 million NFTs, instead of requiring users to burn the Ethereum NFTs before issuing Enjin Blockchain NFTs, which is how the normal migration would work, a snapshot was taken and users are allowed to sign with their Ethereum wallet to claim the Enjin Blockchain NFTs.\u201d\n\nTan explained that this process lets users claim without paying for gas. However, one potential drawback is that instead of the NFTs being burned in Ethereum, they will still exist on the previous networks. \u201cCreators have to ask holders not to trade them and consider the Enjin Blockchain versions the official versions,\u201d Tan added.\n\nMagazine: Web3 Gamer: Games need bots?

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin fell below $41,000 and Ethereum below $2,200 on Monday as crypto markets took a dive after having rallied for the better part of two months.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $40,758, down 7% in the past day. This is after the market already saw $330 million in crypto futures contracts liquidated on Monday morning as BTC fell below $43,000. Total liquidations have now reached $516 million, according to CoinGlass.\n\nStill, the 1-day dip is relative. It's still 5% higher than it was at the start of the month, when BTC was changing hands for $38,688. The same can be said of Ethereum, which has lost 7% since yesterday and is currently trading for $2,185. That's 7% higher than what it started the month at, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization, which has hovered around $1 trillion for the better part of the year, now sits at $1.6 trillion\u2014down 6% since yesterday.\n\nElsewhere in the market, alts were taking a beating. ORDI (ORDI), which last week saw explosive growth and set an all-time high of $68.37, has slumped 14% in the past day. The token, easily the most popular BRC-20 token built on Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals protocol, is now trading for $45.11.\n\nPepecoin (PEPE), which last week jumped 26% during a spike in meme coin activity, has also cooled off. As of this writing, it has fallen 13% in the last day and is trading for $0.00000138.\n\nEven as the some of the largest digital assets by market cap take a hit, there's been good news for some alts.\n\nA new report from digital asset manager CoinShares finds that institutional investors have been especially keen on Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX). Exchange-traded products meant to track the two coins saw $5 million worth of deposits last week. And while most of the gaming token category went red on Monday, Immutable (IMX) saw a 10% gain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Binance USD (BUSD)\u2014a dollar-pegged stablecoin\u2014lost its peg for a while on Monday. As of this writing, BUSD had dropped as low as $0.97, according to CoinGecko. Even though it's a defunct stablecoin, there are still roughly 1.4 billion of the tokens in circulation.\n\nOne possible reason for the price turbulence: Most BUSD margin trading and futures contracts were automatically closed today, according to a Binance blog post.\n\nBUSD has been on a steady decline since the SEC sent a Wells Notice to New York-based firm Paxos, which used to handle minting and redemptions of BUSD on behalf of crypto exchange Binance. In the aftermath, Paxos and Binance said that users could continue to redeem their tokens until February 2024.\n\nThe exchange said BUSD tokens that aren't redeemed before Binance stops support will automatically be converted to FDUSD, a stablecoin issued by FD121 Ltd.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "The Ethereum coin price has steadily recovered since the beginning of December. Starting the month at $20246, the coin price surged to a current high of $2403, registering a 15% growth. Amid this rally, the coin price gave a decisive breakout from the resistance trendline of a long-coming wedge pattern, indicating the potential for higher recovery.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum L2 Starknet Earmarks 1.8B STRK for its Mega Airdrop\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill the ETH Price Rise to $3400?\n\nThe current uncertainty in Ethereum price could trigger a minor fallback to the $2250 mark.\n\nThe ETH price could obtain suitable support at $2250 and $2130 marks.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $7.3 Billion, indicating a 34% loss\n\nThe Ethereum price recovery began in mid-October, starting with a rebound from the $1525 level. This turnaround led to a significant 58.3% increase in its value, bringing it to the current trading price of $2404.\n\nThis upward trajectory has been largely influenced by general market optimism and the formation of a rising wedge pattern. Throughout the year, under this pattern\u2019s guidance, the ETH coin has maintained a slow yet steady uptrend.\n\nA notable event in this rally occurred on December 30th, when the coin\u2019s price broke through the upper trendline of the pattern, signaling a readiness for a more dynamic rally and presenting an entry point for buyers. With an intraday gain of 0.51%, the coin price might revisit the breached trendline to confirm its sustainability.\n\nRiding on this pattern, the ETH price could potentially see a 51% surge, aiming for the $3400 mark\n\nETH vs BTC Performance\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin and Ethereum, has shown substantial growth in the past two months, reinforcing a recovery trend in the cryptocurrency market. However, there\u2019s a distinct difference in their price behaviors: the BTC price has shown a steady increase, while the Ethereum price has been more volatile, with occasional drops. This difference suggests that Bitcoin might offer a more reliable breakout opportunity, whereas the ETH price could be more effectively traded using pullback strategies.\n\nBollinger Band: An upswing in the upper boundary of the Bollinger Band indicator reflects the buyers leading this current rally.\n\nAverage Directional Index: the ADX slope at a 40 % high reflects that the ETH price may need a temporary correction to continue the bullish trend."

Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $42.1K, down 4.07% today, while Ethereum is at $2.23K, down 4.87%.\n\nHowever, traders continue to rally behind Bitcoin ETF Token as its presale surges toward $3.5 million.\n\nMarket overconfidence corrected, but analysts fear another flush\n\nWarning signs of a steep correction have been everywhere over the past few days. Many analysts urged market participants to proceed cautiously, but some believe another flush is imminent even after the recent correction.\n\nCoinMarketCap\u2019s Crypto Fear and Greed Index entered the \u201cextreme greed\u201d zone, indicating that the market may be overbought. This represents a high-risk time for new buyers to enter the market, as a selloff is necessary to restore balance.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto funding rates recently reached a local high. This indicates significantly more long orders than short orders in the market, causing bulls to pay a premium to rebalance.\n\nHigh funding rates are often followed by a \u201cflush,\u201d where futures positions are forcibly closed, causing prices to cascade in the opposite direction.\n\nYou might also like: Will Bitcoin ETFs follow gold ETFs\u2019 path to success?\n\nThis was highlighted by the analyst Mister Crypto, who suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s high funding rates were \u201csignaling a top.\u201d\n\nIn the analysis, Mister Crypto noted that Bitcoin\u2019s price retraced by 20% each time its funding rates reached their recent levels.\n\nGiven Bitcoin has pulled back less than 5% so far, this could indicate a much deeper correction is imminent.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent X commentator MrChief predicts that the market will \u201cpullback enough to stop out early buyers & get bears super excited then reverse back up.\u201d\n\nHowever, other analysts believe the crypto market may be poised for a longer-term pullback. One is RektCapital, who referenced earlier market cycles\u2019 price action to suggest that \u201cthe Bitcoin Pre-Halving top may be very close.\u201d\n\nThat said, the Bitcoin halving is just 137 days away and spot Bitcoin ETFs are on the cusp of approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As such, the market looks poised for a solid mid-term trajectory.\n\nEven so, market participants seeking growth appear to be considering Bitcoin ETF Token whose presale is in progress.\n\nBitcoin ETF Token presale raises $3.4 million in 1 month\n\nBitcoin ETF Token has raised almost $3.5 million in one month. The project features multiple use cases, rewarding holders as the SEC approves spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe project features a deflationary mechanism. 25% of its supply is reserved to be burned across five Bitcoin ETF milestones.\n\nAdditionally, there is a 5% burn tax on transactions, reducing by 1% at each target.\n\nThese scarcity-focused features, combined with the anticipated $1 trillion in liquidity entering the crypto market from the Bitcoin ETFs, could support Bitcoin ETF Token.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin breaks above $40k, Bitcoin ETF Token raises nearly $2.5m\n\nFurther supporting this is the project\u2019s current early stage and low market cap at launch of just $12.39 million.\n\nBitcoin ETF Token also has a staking mechanism, offering a 79% APY. Even so, this will decrease as more tokens are staked, incentivizing buyers to get in early to maximize their gains.\n\nThe project also offers a Bitcoin ETF Alerts service.

Data indicates that Solana's sales have reached nearly $16 million after a 2.78% increase.\n\nThis surge comes despite a broader downturn in the market, with Ethereum seeing a significant drop of 22.70% in sales.\n\nReview of top blockchains\n\nThe blockchain landscape for NFT sales is showing interesting trends. Ethereum has long been the frontrunner in the NFT market, but recent data reveals Solana's ascending trajectory.\n\nEthereum's sales have dropped to $11.4 million, a stark contrast to Solana's nearly $16 million in sales.\n\nBitcoin, typically not a direct player in the NFT space, has recorded sales of $13 million. This is due to the surge of Bitcoin Ordinals, which have also contributed to the flagship cryptocurrency recently overtaking its altcoin archrival in terms of total fees.\n\nOther blockchains like Polygon and ImmutableX are also making their presence felt, albeit with lower sales volumes of $1.5 million and $942,113, respectively.\n\nSolana's NFT marketplace booms\n\nSolana's NFT marketplace has seen a robust increase in activity, with Tensor emerging as the leading platform. The platform has achieved a monthly trading volume of approximately $1 million while surpassing Magic Eden. This positions Tensor at the forefront with about 60% of Solana's total NFT market share.\n\nDespite Tensor's fewer unique wallet users compared to Magic Eden, the platform's traders are engaging with higher volumes."

Over the last 24 hours, while leading cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) succumbed to downward pressure, AVAX charted a different course, posting remarkable 12% growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAVAX has been touted as a beta play, often catching up and occasionally outpacing market leaders after significant rallies. With the ecosystem tokens within the AVAX network gaining momentum, it is clear that investor interest is peaking. The currency's ability to smash through resistance levels that have held firm against market titans like Ethereum indicates robust and growing confidence in AVAX's potential.\n\nHappy Monday \u2600\ufe0f#AVAX is today's best performer, up 12% over the past 24 hours \ud83d\udc40\n\n\n\nSource: https://t.co/tihRplvItm pic.twitter.com/srRBtegYng \u2014 Kaiko (@KaikoData) December 11, 2023\n\nWhen compared to Ethereum's price performance, AVAX shines even brighter. Ethereum has been experiencing a period of consolidation after a strong bull run, but its recent pullback has been more pronounced than expected. In contrast, AVAX has managed to not only maintain its bullish stance but also to accelerate its value appreciation, outperforming Ethereum's recent price action.\n\nThis divergence in performance can be partly attributed to the increasing recognition of AVAX as a formidable player in the DeFi space. As a faster and more cost-effective platform, it is garnering attention from developers and investors alike. This interest is translated into price action, with AVAX demonstrating the characteristics of a strong ecosystem token that leverages the broader market's momentum for significant gains.\n\nThe contrast between AVAX and Ethereum during this period speaks volumes about market dynamics. Where Ethereum reflects the larger market's hesitation, AVAX seizes the opportunity to assert its market presence. It is a classic case of the beta token catching up, leveraging the pumping of its counterparts to establish its own rally."

While several other narratives support the big-picture bullish outlook, spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have a role to play in it.\n\nAs traders and investors continue to anticipate the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) giving approvals for the product launches between January 5 and 10, even Google has taken a hint. An official announcement reveals that \"advertisers offering Cryptocurrency Coin Trust targeting the United States [will be allowed] to advertise those products and services\" beginning January 29, 2024. Notably, this is the same month that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to gain approval in the US.\n\nBitcoin price delivers a healthy retest\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price folding back to record an intra-day low of $40,400 was a healthy retest as the $40,000 psychological level continues to hold as support. If the level holds, then it could precipitate the idea that new all-time highs are in the cards.\n\nMeanwhile, the upside potential remains strong for Bitcoin price as BTC is still not ripe for selling until the Relative Strength Index (RSI) crosses below the 70 level. With the Awesome Oscillator (AO) showing large volumes of green histogram bars, the bulls still maintain a strong presence in the market though. The RSI could simply hold above 70.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Bitcoin price overcome the weekly supply zone extending from $40,698 to $46,999. A weekly candlestick close above the $43,860 mean threshold would confirm the continuation of the primary trend.\n\nSuch a move would set the tone for Bitcoin price to flip the supply zone into a bullish breaker, confirmed by a move above the $48,725 resistance level.In a highly bullish case, Bitcoin price could extend to tag the $66,098 resistance level into a support floor.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nConversely, if the weekly supply zone defends as a resistance order block, Bitcoin price could pull south, losing the support at $40,000. A decisive weekly candlestick close below this level would put BTC on the cliff, potentially rolling over to the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin braces for volatility-filled week with November CPI data release, Fed decision\n\nEthereum price sell-off threatens upside potential\n\nEthereum (ETH) price also crashed alongside Bitcoin, losing almost 9% in market value. However, the move remains a healthy pullback as the $2,147 support level did not break. As long as ETH remains above the $2,000 psychological level, the upside potential remains alive.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could see Ethereum price clear the $2,403 range high even as it continues to consolidate within the confines of an ascending parallel channel.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, increased seller momentum could plunge Ethereum price out of the bullish chart pattern, confirmed by a break and close below critical $2,147 support. ETH might then confirm the continuation of the fall by breaking and closing below the midline of the supply zone turned bullish breaker at $2,075. The move could clear the path for the largest altcoin by market capitalization to spiral to the $2,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum leads altcoins north as Bitcoin halts amid bull trap fears"

The price did dip briefly late Sunday along with other top tokens, but then quickly rebounded, popping as high as $2.06 early Monday. That\u2019s a 20-month high for the gaming token.\n\nImmutable is an Ethereum gaming platform that\u2019s based around the current Immutable X scaling network, as well as the upcoming Immutable zkEVM network powered by Polygon zkEVM. IMX is now up 41% in the last week alone, pushing the token to an 83% jump in the last 30 days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFollowing recent collaboration announcements with Amazon and major game publisher Ubisoft, IMX may have also seen a recent boost following a vote of confidence from investment firm VanEck late last week.\n\nIn a report on crypto predictions for 2024, VanEck suggested that IMX is poised to become a top 25 coin by market cap\u2014it\u2019s currently #31 following recent gains\u2014alongside the release of upcoming games like Illuvium and Guild of Guardians. VanEck also said that Immutable has been \u201cworking to resolve many of the technical pain points that have inhibited the success of Web3 gaming so far.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Immutable announced a new collaboration with payments processor Transak to make it the \u201cprimary payments partner\u201d for Immutable Checkout on the zkEVM network.\n\nThe only other gaming token on the rise today in the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market cap is Echelon Prime (PRIME), the token of the buzzy NFT trading card game Parallel, which is up 12% over the past 24 hours to a current price of just under $8.00. PRIME, which launched earlier this year, just set an all-time high in late November at $8.93.\n\nBroadly, however, major gaming tokens are down today following weeks of recent gains. The Sandbox (SAND), Axie Infinity (AXS), Illuvium (ILV), and ApeCoin (APE) are each down about 9% over the past 24 hours, while recent riser Ronin (RON) is down nearly 7% to $1.54. Even so, RON is up 93% over the past month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price is likely to rally to $48,000, as market participants keep up with the updates on Bitcoin Spot ETF applications.\n\nAltcoins like Ethereum, Chainlink, Arbitrum and Optimism are likely to gain from BTC\u2019s price rally.\n\nEthereum price is likely to rally alongside Bitcoin as ETH holders await Spot Ethereum ETF approval by the US SEC.\n\nCrypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe picked four altcoins for the ongoing bull run, in his recent video on YouTube. The analyst believes these altcoins could outperform other assets and yield gains for traders, alongside Bitcoin price rally to $48,000.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum derivatives data points at bullish start for ETH in 2024\n\nBitcoin dominance peaks, drives gains in altcoins\n\nBitcoin dominance is at 50.2%, according to data from CoinGecko. At the current level, alongside Bitcoin price rally, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) are likely to yield gains for holders.\n\nPoppe explains that Bitcoin is currently in a stage where the asset is rallying and there is a likelihood of a potential top. There is hype surrounding the speculation of approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and capital is likely to flow into altcoins. Volatility is likely to go away from Bitcoin and drive gains in altcoins like Ethereum.\n\nETH holders are awaiting an approval of Spot Ethereum ETF and this could fuel gains in the asset. Ethereum price could correct in response to a correction in BTC, however Poppe has set a target of $3,000 for ETH price this cycle.\n\nWith Bitcoin dominance peaking out, altcoins like ChainLink, Arbitrum and Optimism are likely to rally. Just as seen in 2019 and 2020, ChainLink price rallies after weeks of sideways price action. LINK is therefore on the brink of multiple bullish breakouts.\n\nPoppe identified a massive bullish divergence in Arbitrum and Optimism and notes that these two altcoins are finalizing their accumulation stage, gearing up for a breakout. At the time of writing, Bitcoin price is close to the $44,000 level, ARB and OP are trading at $1.1327 and $2.1510, on Binance, respectively."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nA recent analysis of on-chain Ethereum transactions highlights the moves of one such investor, revealing a pattern of strategic trades that may coincide with significant price movements in the Ethereum market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe transaction history of this Ethereum whale demonstrates a series of calculated swaps and liquidity moves, often involving substantial sums of Ether (ETH), stablecoins like USDC and other tokens. For example, several transactions show the investor swapping large quantities of ETH for USDC and vice versa, potentially capitalizing on market volatility. This series of swaps suggests a pattern of entering and exiting positions in alignment with market fluctuations \u2014 buying when prices are lower and selling when prices are higher.\n\nAn examination of the dates and sizes of these transactions reveals that this investor possibly operates with a keen eye on market trends, making swaps and trades that often precede or follow market price changes. For instance, large inflows or outflows of ETH from their wallet occasionally align with subsequent rises or dips in Ethereum's price, suggesting that the whale may be trading on anticipatory market insights or contributing to price momentum through their actions.\n\nReviewing the attached Ethereum price chart, one can attempt to correlate the whale's transaction dates with notable price movements. The chart shows Ethereum's price trajectory over time, marked by various technical indicators such as moving averages. By comparing the transaction timestamps with the chart's data points, we could infer whether the whale's trades were timely in relation to price rallies or corrections.\n\nFor instance, a series of large swaps from ETH to USDC might be synchronized with a local peak on the price chart, indicating the whale's strategy to secure profits before a potential downturn. Conversely, a sizable conversion from USDC to ETH might precede a bullish run, suggesting an accumulation strategy in anticipation of price appreciation."

        "content": "Ethereum has long reigned over the NFT sector.\n\nSolana recently overtook Ethereum in NFT sales.\n\nSolana\u2019s uprising could signal a massive shift in industry dynamics.\n\nSolana\u2019s incredible performance this year has positioned the project as a formidable threat to Ethereum\u2019s reign as the network turns heads with its on-chain and trading activity.\n\nAfter successfully surpassing Ethereum in on-chain activity, Solana outshines its rival in another important metric, NFT sales.\n\nSolana Outpaces Ethereum\n\nEthereum has ruled the NFT industry for years with its trading volume, projects, user adoption, and more. However, considering its persistent issues like network congestion and rising fees, its dominance is proving fleeting as competitors like Solana close the gap.\n\nFollowing Solana\u2019s historic run this year, registering over 800% in gains and marking record DEX volumes and network transactions, the network surpassed Ethereum in NFT sales on December 9 after hosting over $16 million.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum trailed closely behind with $13.4 and $11.4 million in sales, respectively. Although Solana remained the second-largest NFT protocol at the time of writing, its trajectory signals a credible threat to Ethereum\u2019s throne.\n\nSolana\u2019s success in the NFT sector aligns with investors and developers slowly warming up to the network and recognizing its potential. While the network is still miles behind Ethereum when considering historical data, Solana\u2019s uprising could signal a massive shift in the industry\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nSolana\u2019s NFT sales are still far below their 2022 levels. In June 2022, Solana registered more than $1 billion in NFT volume.\n\nEthereum\u2019s all-time NFT sales have reached $41 billion, while Solana\u2019s total NFT sales amount to $4 billion.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nSolana overtaking Ethereum signals a potential shift in industry dynamics. Ethereum has long been the dominant force in the NFT sector, boasting high volumes, adoption, and sales. However, Solana is slowly closing the gap and giving the network a run for its money.\n\n\n\nRead how Charles Hoskinson\u2019s innocent update turned into a memecoin frenzy:\n\nCardano Founder Accidental Memecoin Plug Spells Disaster\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Tether\u2019s new policy:\n\nTether\u2019s New Wallet-Freezing Policy: What Holders Need to Know\n\n"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has recorded Ethereum Spot ETF filings from several institutional players. As Bloomberg reported, a total of 7 Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have been filed so far.\n\nVanEck, Fidelity, Ishares, Invesco & Galaxy, Grayscale, Hashdex, and ARK & 21 Shares are the institutions behind these Ethereum filings.\n\nWhile regulators had previously recognized some of these filings in the past, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) only recently acknowledged Fidelity\u2019s ETF Spot application.\n\nAll the aforementioned Ethereum ETF applications are currently under review by the SEC. The regulator is required to approve or deny these applications in the long term. The regulator can also postpone approval deadlines.\n\nSimilarly, leading crypto and traditional institutions have filed a handful of Bitcoin ETFs. While the U.S. is yet to approve of a Bitcoin or an Ethereum Spot ETF, market players are more optimistic than ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy design, a Cryptocurrency Spot ETF can keep account of the market price of existing crypto assets and allow investors to partake in investment without directly holding or purchasing any crypto assets.\n\nSome industry figures who recognize that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF might take much longer are convinced that Ethereum Spot ETFs stand a better chance of approval.\n\nEther is already responding positively to the recent development. The price of the second most-valued cryptocurrency by market cap has soared by 2.9% in the last hour, with prices at $2,355. In the previous 30 days, Ether has increased by more than 16%. Market cap and trading volume are also in the green zone.\n\nNear-term price predictions are also collectively bullish at this time. One analyst took to X, formerly Twitter, to make a bullish call.\n\n\u201cEthereum Spot ETF filing by Fidelity! Confirms my thesis that after Bitcoin gets its shine, we\u2019ll see Ethereum running to $3,500 in Q1 2024.\u201d He wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, On-chain metrics have rolled out whale performance recorded over the past months. According to data shared by Santiment, an on-chain analytics platform, big hands are transferring their Ether holdings and moving them from exchanges to self-bustody.\n\nAs the Santiment explained;\n\n\u201cThe largest Ethereum wallets continue forming an encouraging pattern, with exchange wallets now reduced to 6-month lows (8.03M ETH) and non-exchange wallets soaring to an all time high (41.03M ETH). More and more coins continue moving to self custody.\u201d"

        "title": "Digital currency's Titanic: Ethereum's sinking ship of flawed technology exposed - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Much like the Titanic setting sail with fanfare and promise, Ethereum emerged on the digital currency scene as a beacon of blockchain innovation. With its smart contracts and decentralized applications, it promised to revolutionize finance and create a decentralized internet.\n\nHowever, as we delve beneath the surface, like the iceberg that sank the Titanic, Ethereum\u2019s technical and security flaws lurk ominously, threatening to sink investors\u2019 hopes and funds into the icy abyss of financial despair.\n\nEthereum\u2019s technical flaws\n\nScalability issues\n\nEthereum (ETH) advocates often boast about its transition to Ethereum 2.0, heralding it as the solution to the network\u2019s long-standing scalability woes. However, Ethereum 2.0 grapples with fundamental scaling limitations even with a new genesis block\u200b\u200b.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with ETH\u2019s scalability issues, notably a low transaction throughput of around five transactions per second. This limitation has been acknowledged even by the project\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin\u200b\u200b.\n\nSlow transaction speeds\n\nThe scalability problem is exacerbated during high-traffic periods, making Ethereum less capable of handling increased load during bull markets\u200b.\n\nEthereum\u2019s defenders may argue that its slower transaction speeds are a trade-off for better security. However, these slow speeds, especially during high network demand, hamper its usability for real-time applications, creating a bottleneck that\u2019s hard to overlook.\n\nHigh gas fees\n\nThe argument that high gas fees are a measure of Ethereum\u2019s popularity and network usage falls flat when these fees devour small investors\u2019 funds, making many transactions unfeasible.\n\nYour system simply can\u2019t support microtransactions if the fees cost 10,000% more than the amount you want to send.\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nSmart contract vulnerabilities\n\nDespite the many smart contracts deployed on Ethereum, security flaws have led to significant financial losses, undermining the ecosystem\u2019s stability\u200b\u200b. Ethereum bagholders might argue that these are growing pains, but the recurring issues highlight a systemic problem.\n\nSeth Green, the actor and creator of \u201cRobot Chicken,\u201d faced a significant setback when his Bored Ape NFT #8398, crucial for his upcoming animated series \u201cWhite Horse Tavern,\u201d was stolen in a phishing attack. The NFT, named Fred Simian in the series, was to be the main character. Green, who had developed the show around this NFT for over a year, was forced into a complex situation involving legal rights and ownership issues. Eventually, he paid an additional 165 ETH (about $260,000) to retrieve the NFT.\n\nMeanwhile, BSV blockchain\u2019s re-enabled smart contracting shows promise with potentially better security provisions and could bypass the pitfalls that have plagued Ethereum.\n\n51% attack threat\n\nThe switch to a Proof of Stake (PoS) model, as Ethereum advocates argue, is to reduce energy consumption. However, this switch exposes Ethereum to new security issues, making it more vulnerable than its Proof of Work (PoW) predecessor.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s tried-and-tested PoW mechanism continues to provide robust security, a feature Ethereum traded for short-term narrative benefits, thus potentially putting investor funds at risk.\n\nLack of privacy\n\nWhile providing transparency, Ethereum\u2019s open ledger system and account-based model expose user transactions to the public eye. Advocates may argue this transparency is a boon, but with one wallet for everything, the trade-off in privacy can have profound implications.\n\nActor and comedian Bill Murray\u2019s digital currency wallet, used to sell official NFTs inspired by his life, was once attacked following a charity auction. The attack resulted in a loss of $174,000 from his wallet.\n\nBlockchain solutions using the UTXO (unspent transaction outputs) model offer better privacy measures while maintaining transparency, providing a more balanced approach to user privacy and security.\n\nThe vaporware concern\n\nEthereum\u2019s repeated failure to deliver on its scaling promises, even with Ethereum 2.0, raises concerns about it being glamourized vaporware, with fundamental design flaws inhibiting its progress\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe mirage of a fully scalable and secure Ethereum continues to elude its developers, casting a long, chilling shadow on crypto\u2019s future, much like the Titanic\u2019s voyage cut short by an unforeseen disaster.\n\nAs Ethereum sails through the stormy seas of the digital currency world, the iceberg of technical and security flaws looms large. Buterin\u2019s ship is steered by a narrative that does not hold water when scrutinized closely.\n\nCompetition and conclusion\n\nThe watershed moment has already begun with the advent of Ordinals, as BTC increasingly sees more NFT sales volume daily than ETH and Solana combined. This trend will only continue with the wave of fungible tokens on BTC.\n\nAdditionally, the recent introduction of BitVM is a noteworthy advancement. By allowing smart contracts without altering BTC\u2019s consensus rules and eliminating the need for a hard fork, BitVM could significantly expand the scope and capabilities of BTC.\n\nMeanwhile, as Xiaohui Liu notes, sCrypt is literally \u201ca development platform for smart contracts\u201d on Bitcoin. These developments have led to a broader range of applications and use cases, making Bitcoin a more versatile and powerful blockchain than Ethereum.\n\nBefore boarding digital currency\u2019s Titanic, investors ought to eye the lifeboats of alternative, more seaworthy vessels. The digital ocean is vast, and while Ethereum may have launched with promise, the icebergs in its path pose a threat too significant to ignore.\n\nIn stark contrast, the BSV blockchain has shattered records, boasting thousands of times more throughput capability than Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nThanks to its unbounded scalability, the BSV network handles thousands of transactions per second. With the BSV blockchain, smart contracts run with transaction fees that are 1000x cheaper than Ethereum, showcasing a more economically viable platform.\n\nHow long can the market stay irrational?\n\nThis article introduces a new series, FUDslinging: Facts, Uncertainty, and Doubt. In my next column, I\u2019ll uncover what the small block maximalists and laser eyes don\u2019t want you to know about the BTC Lightning Network (RIP).\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple, Ethereum,\n\nFTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market.\n\nNew to blockchain?

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market faced a significant downturn, the SHIB/USDT chart showcased a resilience that not many had expected. While Ethereum (ETH) experienced a notable decline, failing to maintain its upward momentum, SHIB managed to stay within an ascending channel, suggesting stronger relative bullish sentiment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe price chart for Shiba Inu reflects an asset that, despite market-wide corrections, has stuck to its ascending trajectory. This resilience is indicative of an unexpected support base and existing demand for SHIB, even during volatile market movements. On the other hand, Ethereum's chart tells a different story; the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap broke below key support levels, indicating a less resilient price performance in the same period.\n\nOne reason for SHIB's surprising strength could be its recent history. Unlike Ethereum, which had been rallying to new highs, SHIB's rally was of a smaller magnitude, leading to less drastic corrections. With smaller gains, there was less ground to fall back on during the market pullback, allowing SHIB to maintain its composure and trend within its channel.\n\nThe moderate rally of Shiba Inu meant that when the market tumbled, the meme coin did not have as far to drop. In contrast, Ethereum's significant rally set higher expectations and a stronger potential for profit-taking, which likely contributed to its steeper decline. This difference in precorrection performance allowed SHIB to demonstrate a notable divergence from Ethereum's price path.\n\nIn comparison to Ethereum's chart, which broke below its 50-day moving average \u2014 a bearish sign \u2014 SHIB's price is hovering above its own, maintaining bullish indications. This stark contrast in technical posture between the two cryptocurrencies underscores the current narrative: SHIB's market is showing signs of persistent buyer interest and could be positioned for a quicker recovery post-correction."

        "content": "A key indicator seemed to suggest that ETH might fall to $2,150 before a bull run\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s social metrics dropped, a few market indicators were bearish\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] price recently fell victim to a price correction like the rest of the crypto-market. Ahead of the said episode, a key ETH indicator flashed a similar outcome. Not only that, but AMBCrypto has also reported how top players in the crypto-space lost some faith in ETH as they started to sell their holdings.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price is dropping\n\nAfter a comfortable rally, the king of altcoins\u2019 price registered a decline in the short-term. According to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by nearly 5% in the last 24 hours alone. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,239.24 with a market capitalization of over $269 billion.\n\nUnfortunately, ETH\u2019s trading volume increased while its price dropped, which is generally perceived as a bearish signal. In fact, Ali, a popular crypto-analyst, rightfully pointed out yet another bearish metric for Ethereum.\n\n#Ethereum | The TD Sequential has flashed a sell signal on the $ETH 3-day chart. \ud83d\udea8 If this signal is confirmed, it might set up a prime buying opportunity with #ETH potentially retracing to $2,150. This could be a key moment before a potential rally toward $3,500. pic.twitter.com/hozCr7CNQZ \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 10, 2023\n\nAccording to the analyst, the TD Sequential has flashed a sell signal on Ethereum\u2019s 3-day chart.\n\nFor starters, the TD Sequential is a tool designed to identify the exact time of trend exhaustion and price reversal. Ali mentioned that if this signal is confirmed, it might set up a prime buying opportunity, with ETH potentially retracing to $2,150. Considering the ongoing price trend, the possibility of ETH falling to $2,150 seems to be high.\n\nWhat to expect from ETH\n\nTo better understand what ETH\u2019s future might look like, AMBCrypto checked the token\u2019s on-chain metrics. Our analysis found that selling pressure on the token was high as its exchange reserve was increasing, as per CryptoQuant\u2019s data.\n\nAdditionally, both ETH\u2019s Korea Premium and Funds Premium were red, meaning Korean investors and institutional investors have been selling their holdings.\n\nNot only retail investors, but as reported previously by AMBCrypto, whales are also selling ETH. To be precise, a whale made a significant deposit of 3,700 ETH (equivalent to $8.72 million) to Binance recently.\n\nHere, it is interesting to note that while the token\u2019s price dropped sharply, its social volume also declined slightly. Negative sentiment around the token skyrocketed too, as is evidenced by the dip in its weighted sentiment.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2023\u201324\n\nAMBCrypto then had a look at ETH\u2019s daily chart to see the viability of the token\u2019s price plummeting further.\n\nEthereum\u2019s MACD projected the possibility of a bearish crossover, which can push the token\u2019s price down to the $2,150-mark in the near term. On the contrary, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered an uptick \u2013 An optimistic sign."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has hit an 18-month high with its value, and this recent price movement suggests that bulls could lead the rally in the short run while the crypto could swing much higher during 2024. The price breakout above the $2,000 hurdle gained the attention of whales, triggering this rally.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that ETH is currently in a correction, but many analysts seem to be of the opinion that it\u2019s a healthy one.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) also showcased a similar pattern, as it saw a significant upswing in value since the start of its presale. With the introduction of blockchain and AI-driven elements into the $280 trillion real estate market, it\u2019s becoming an interesting project to watch.vsichkite\n\nEthereum (ETH) Broke Past $2,000 in the Past Month \u2013 Can It Reach $4,000?\n\nEthereum (ETH) saw a breakout above the $2,000 range during the past month and, since then, has been heading rapidly in an upward direction. It gained the attention of investors, which was triggered by its rally, and the price continued the momentum supported by a decent buying volume.\n\nThe EMAs for Ethereum showcased a golden crossover that boosted the confidence of long-term investors. It also showcases that the price is in a strong uptrend as bulls continue their dominance. The price of the Ethereum crypto is now in the grip of bulls and is trading near the 18-month high. The majority of the games occurred within the past month, and as a result, it\u2019s clear that bulls are active on the market.\n\nPseudonymously analyst known as Bluntz told his over 230,000 followers on X (Twitter) that the ETH crypto officially entered a bull territory after leaving the multi-month accumulation range.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the crypto will leave behind traders who are fixated on ETH\u2019s gains against BTC. In the past week, the ETH crypto moved between $2,079.53 and $2,380.99.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the price has corrected to $2,250 \u2013 a 4% retrace in the past 24 hours, following the broader crypto market.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Introduces AI-Driven Tools to the Real Estate Market\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) is a real estate marketplace that will introduce AI technology to the $280 trillion real estate market. The platform will enable anyone to get into real estate investing without needing to have millions of dollars in upfront capital.\n\nIt aims to solve issues such as transparency, liquidity, and lack of accessibility.

These retain the benefits found in property ownership, such as value appreciation and passive income through rentals.\n\nThe ecosystem will feature a Property Launchpad, where builders can get support from the community and those who jump into properties early and get the most gains as a result. There will be a dedicated AI tool that will monitor and scan global property prices in all territories. It will then give an up-to-date snapshot of a specific region at that point in time. As a result, it is used as a predictor for undervalued markets.\n\nEverlodge also saw a significant level of attention.

        "content": "Whales began to sell their ETH holdings.\n\nPrice remained the same, and institutions started to show interest in ETHE.\n\nEthereum [ETH] price has been soaring upward over the last few weeks. Due to this, many holders that got in early, could try to sell their holdings for a profit.\n\nOne major whale had already started selling off its holdings.\n\nProfit taking season\n\nThe whale, proficient in the art of swing trading with Ethereum ETH, has recently initiated the selling of ETH. The whale has made a substantial deposit of 3,700 ETH (equivalent to $8.72 million) to the Binance platform.\n\nAt present, the whale holds a total of 10,000 ETH, amounting to $23.58 million in value.\n\nThe whale\u2019s strategic selling of Ethereum could impact the market in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, if the whale\u2019s actions lead to increased liquidity and more balanced price levels, it could contribute to a healthier and more stable ETH market.\n\nHowever, on the negative side, large transactions like these can also introduce volatility, potentially causing short-term price fluctuations and influencing investor sentiment.\n\nThe sell-offs were not isolated to one whale. Recent data showed that many top addresses on exchanges had seen a decline in their supply.\n\nHowever, despite the whale sell-offs, the overall price momentum of ETH wasn\u2019t affected. The price of ETH was $2,361.38, at the time of writing. Its price had grown by 0.41% in the last 24 hours.\n\nInstitutions remain keen\n\nHowever, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust premium gap, previously at -59.49% in December 2022, narrowed due to institutional buying, positively impacting ETH\u2019s trajectory.\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust premium gap refers to the difference between the market price of Ethereum (ETH) and the price at which the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) shares are valued.\n\nA negative premium indicates that ETHE shares are trading below the market value of ETH. In December 2022, the premium gap was at -59.49%, suggesting that ETHE shares were significantly undervalued compared to the actual price of ETH.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nThe narrowing of this premium gap is attributed to institutional buying, which means that institutional investors were acquiring ETHE shares.\n\nWhen institutions invest in trust products like Grayscale, it often reflects confidence in the underlying asset, in this case, Ethereum."

        "content": "Ethereum's role in the crypto ecosystem and its appeal to investors continue to shape its trajectory, closely intertwined with developments in interest rates.\n\nEthereum exhibited a back-and-forth pattern during the early hours of Friday, revealing signs of potential strain in this market.\n\nHowever, Ethereum's performance has lagged behind Bitcoin, suggesting it may have some ground to cover.\n\nIn any case, the prevailing trend continues to draw enthusiastic buyers during dips, with Thursday's impressive surge standing out, particularly given Bitcoin's relative stability.\n\nThe common driver behind this crypto ascent remains the trajectory of interest rates.\n\nForex Brokers We Recommend in Your Region See full brokers list\n\nRemarkably, Ethereum managed to breach a formidable resistance barrier nestled near the $2100 level. This breakthrough has unlocked the prospect of ascending to loftier altitudes. Presently, Ethereum hovers just above the $2300 level, and it seems that short-term retracements will persistently present buying opportunities, with the $2100 level serving as a pivotal support zone. Of particular note, the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average stands around the $1950 mark, an indicator closely scrutinized by many market participants.\n\nOn the horizon, Ethereum could potentially set its sights on the $2500 level, a significant milestone by virtue of its round, psychologically resonant value. The $2500 level would undoubtedly attract considerable attention and generate headlines. The overarching strategy in this landscape is the pursuit of value and the strategic exploitation of opportunities. Ethereum's long-term trajectory and its potential adoption as an everyday utility remain uncertain. However, Ethereum's role as the foundational platform for numerous other crypto projects continues to drive demand, as evidenced on multiple occasions in the past.\n\nEthereum's Trajectory Amid Dollar Decline and Interest Rate Dynamics\n\nIn the broader context, the market will persist in its quest for value, capitalizing on the possibility that the US dollar may continue its decline. It's worth noting that a dramatic surge in interest rates could exert downward pressure not only on Ethereum but on the entire crypto spectrum. It's important to remember that cryptocurrencies represent a relatively high-risk asset class on the institutional investor spectrum. Consequently, the flow of capital will ebb, and flow based on fluctuations in the \"risk-free rate\" of bonds.\n\nIn the end, the breach of the $2100 resistance level has opened the door to higher price targets, while the $2500 level looms as a significant psychological threshold. Ethereum's role in the crypto ecosystem and its appeal to investors continue to shape its trajectory, closely intertwined with developments in interest rates. The crypto market remains an arena of volatility, where position sizing \u2013 and trend following will be paramount.\n\nReady to trade ETH/USD?

        "content": "Although the concept of a smart contract has existed since the 1990s, Ethereum was the first platform to recognize its potential and remove the necessity for a third party through its implementation. This has contributed to the advancement of the smart contract market.\n\nHowever, according to a Banklesstimes.com analysis, the number of new smart contracts deployed over the past six months has fallen by over 90%. The number of new smart contracts deployed on June 1, 2023, stood at 1.4m. However, 60.4k smart contracts were deployed on Ethereum on December 1.\n\nBanklessTimes crypto expert Alice Leetham commented:\n\nTypically, the number of contracts executed on a contract network indicates the level of on-chain engagement. There is a greater chance that this engagement could impact price movements when there are more dApps in various sectors, like DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and others. This is because ETH, the token of Ethereum, is utilized for settling network fees. BanklessTimes crypto expert Alice Leetham\n\nShe added that whenever there is a spike in on-chain activity, the demand for block space is higher, requiring developers to use more ETH for a slot in a block.\n\n$3000 in the First Few Days of 2024?\n\nFalling contract deployment coincides with the exemplary performance of ETH prices. ETH prices have rallied from $1873.91 on June 1st to $2352.50 on December 11th. Even though bulls are yet to push the coin above $2400, an immediate resistance level that, if broken, could see ETH prices float to new 2024 highs.\n\nThroughout history, there has been a link between the quantity of contracts utilized and the corresponding price movements. It is common for developers to intensify their efforts when prices are on a trend, resulting in contracts being deployed. However, it is worth noting that this pattern was not evident in the performance observed earlier in June. During that time, there was a disparity between spot prices and the number of contracts launched.\n\nDespite experiencing a fivefold increase between January 14 and January 23, there is potential for a much higher number of contracts if this action were synchronized with the fluctuations in ETH prices.\n\nHowever, it's worth mentioning that smart contracts on the Ethereum network have shown growth in 2022. According to a report from Alchemy, a software company, over 100,000 dApps were introduced during the course of the year."

        "content": "The major cryptocurrencies displayed a mixed performance on Sunday evening as Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, seemed to be undergoing a correction, while some altcoins were experiencing significant gains.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD -4.37% $41,846 Ethereum ETH/USD +5.17% $2,351 Dogecoin DOGE/USD -3.88% $0.095\n\nWhat Happened: Bitcoin\u2019s rally experienced a temporary pause on Sunday as it briefly dropped to $41,800. This slight decline indicates that traders may have opted to secure some profits after witnessing the cryptocurrency\u2019s substantial surge from $38,000 just a week ago.\n\nETH witnessed a notable 5% surge reaching its highest price point since May 2022.\n\nData from CoinGlass shows that in the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market experienced a total liquidation value of $374.41 million and 109,015 traders were affected. The largest individual liquidation order occurred on OKX, involving BTC-USDT-SWAP with a value of $8.23 million.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Helium +14.06% $5.06 BitTorrent +11.99% $0.00000124 Injective +8.06% $20.63\n\nThe global crypto market cap has reached $1.6 trillion, marking a 1.34% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nU.S. stock futures showed a slight increase on Sunday night as investors eagerly anticipate the final Federal Reserve meeting of 2023.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 22 points, equivalent to a 0.06% increase, while S&P futures and Nasdaq 100 futures experienced smaller gains of less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both closed Friday with a notable six-week winning streak, achieving gains of 0.2% and 0.7% respectively. In contrast, the Dow remained relatively flat throughout the week.\n\nDuring the upcoming Fed\u2019s policy meeting on Wednesday, Chair Jerome Powell is anticipated to keep the key fed funds rate unchanged within the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, a level it has maintained since July. Market expectations, as indicated by the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool, currently suggest a 45% probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate reduction by the Fed in March.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe notes that the Altcoin market capitalization has recently broken out of an 18-month sideways range. Looking ahead, \"the next potential areas for a top are going to be between $1.1-1.3T.\"\n\nEli Taranto, Executive Director at EQI Bank, in a note seen by Benzinga, said, \"As the US posted a stronger than expected employment report, Bitcoin gained over the weekend but risks remain that it will see lower territory in the coming weeks, seeing around $40K in the holiday period.\"\n\nHe added, \" Pressure on BTC will continue to mount as retail investors may choose to take profits for the holiday period. While the Santa Rally may offset this, all eyes are now on the coming ETFs, after BTC price has already factored in key US economic indicators. \"\n\nA pseudonymous crypto analyst suggests that Bitcoin may be following a pattern similar to Amazon\u2019s stock (AMZN) from over a decade ago. The analyst, known as TechDev, shares a chart on X comparing BTC\u2019s price movements over the past three years to AMZN in 2010 and 2011.\n\n\"Here's that time AMZN retested its prior all-time high with an expanded flat correction. Just as BTC did.Then here's a dissection of the structural similarities of both flats. Green line is where BTC has moved to since the chart.\"\n\nTechDev points out that both charts display double tops in the respective assets, followed by significant corrections to previous all-time highs. The analyst notes that both also experience sudden parabolic moves to new all-time highs with minimal or no dips in between.\n\n\"A rapid move to new highs from here would not be unusual for expanded flat retests of a prior ATH, if you can move past the herd narrative regarding the halving. Not a guarantee. $32,000 retest scenario still on the table. But if we are up only to new highs from here, I would not be surprised. When structural analogs work, it's because mass human speculative behavior doesn't change, regardless of asset.\"\n\nPhoto by CMP_NZ on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH) has long been considered a frontrunner, particularly in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi). However, a new DeFi sensation is on the horizon, and it goes by the name of Retik Finance (RETIK). With bold forecasts for 2024 and the potential for explosive growth, RETIK is positioning itself to give Ethereum a run for its money.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll delve into the Ethereum price forecast for 2024 and explore why Retik Finance is the DeFi sensation to watch out for.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast for 2024\n\nBefore we dive into the Retik Finance phenomenon, let\u2019s take a moment to examine the Ethereum price forecast for 2024. Ethereum, often dubbed the \u201cking of DeFi,\u201d has been a cornerstone of the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Analysts and experts have been closely monitoring its price movements and trends. After analysing historical data, they have arrived at some intriguing predictions for the year 2024.\n\nMinimum Price Projection: Analysts suggest that Ethereum\u2019s price in 2024 may see a minimum of approximately $1,065.86. This figure represents a baseline, and it\u2019s crucial to note that cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, meaning prices can fluctuate significantly.\n\nMaximum Price Projection: On the other end of the spectrum, the maximum expected price for Ethereum in 2024 is estimated to be around $1,891.08. This upper limit reflects a more bullish scenario, assuming favourable market conditions and increased adoption.\n\nAverage Trading Price: When we consider an average trading price, Ethereum is anticipated to hover around $2,716.30 in 2024. This middle-ground projection serves as a baseline for potential price movements during the year.\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK): The DeFi Sensation of 2024\n\nWhile Ethereum has undoubtedly been a dominant force in the DeFi sector, Retik Finance (RETIK) is gearing up to steal the spotlight in 2024. Here\u2019s why Retik Finance is being touted as the DeFi sensation to watch:\n\n1. Innovative DeFi Debit Cards\n\nAt the core of Retik Finance\u2019s appeal is its innovative DeFi Debit Cards. These cards empower users to spend their cryptocurrency holdings in real-world transactions, bridging the gap between the digital and physical realms of finance. The unique combination of crypto utility and ease of use positions Retik Finance as a game-changer.\n\n2. Projected Explosive Growth\n\nExperts and analysts are projecting explosive growth for Retik Finance in 2024. While Ethereum remains a strong contender, Retik Finance\u2019s comprehensive ecosystem, including DeFi Debit Cards, an AI-powered peer-to-peer lending platform, a secure DeFi wallet, and a next-gen payment gateway, positions it as a versatile and innovative project.\n\n3. Cashback Rewards and Incentives\n\nRetik Finance\u2019s cashback rewards program is a major attraction for users. With every transaction made using Retik\u2019s DeFi Debit Cards, users can earn cashback in RETIK tokens. This financial incentive encourages active engagement with the platform and further drives adoption.\n\n4. Privacy and Security\n\nRetik Finance places a strong emphasis on user privacy and security. Unlike traditional financial systems, its DeFi Debit Cards do not require Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, ensuring that user transactions remain confidential and secure. This commitment to privacy resonates with many cryptocurrency users.\n\n5. Real-World Integration\n\nThe ability to seamlessly use cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions is a game-changer. Retik Finance\u2019s integration of DeFi Debit Cards into users\u2019 daily lives positions it as a practical choice for individuals looking to bridge the gap between digital and traditional finance.\n\n6. Strategic Vision\n\nRetik Finance\u2019s vision extends far beyond DeFi Debit Cards. The project offers a comprehensive suite of services, including an AI-powered peer-to-peer lending platform, a secure DeFi wallet, and a next-gen payment gateway. This holistic approach to decentralized finance sets it apart from the competition.\n\nThe Potential for 2000% Profits in 2024\n\nAs we look ahead to 2024, both Ethereum and Retik Finance have their respective strengths and unique value propositions. Ethereum\u2019s established presence in the DeFi space cannot be underestimated. However, Retik Finance\u2019s innovative approach, coupled with its DeFi Debit Cards, could potentially lead to extraordinary growth and profits.\n\nWhy Retik Finance Could Outshine Ethereum\n\nWhile Ethereum remains a formidable force, several factors give Retik Finance an edge in 2024:\n\n1. Diverse Utility\n\nRetik Finance\u2019s utility extends beyond DeFi Debit Cards. Its ecosystem includes AI-powered peer-to-peer lending, a secure DeFi wallet, and a next-gen payment gateway. This comprehensive approach positions RETIK as a versatile and innovative project.\n\n2. Financial Incentives\n\nThe cashback rewards program offered by Retik Finance incentivizes users to actively engage with the platform. These rewards can foster loyalty and encourage users to make more cryptocurrency transactions, driving adoption and engagement.\n\n3. Real-World Integration\n\nThe ability to use cryptocurrencies seamlessly for everyday transactions is a significant advantage. Retik Finance\u2019s integration of DeFi Debit Cards into users\u2019 daily lives makes it a practical choice for individuals looking to bridge the gap between digital and traditional finance.\n\n4.

By not requiring KYC verification, Retik Finance respects users\u2019 desire for anonymity, potentially attracting a more privacy-conscious user base.\n\n5. Projected Growth\n\nThe projections for Retik Finance\u2019s growth in 2024 are optimistic. While Ethereum remains a strong contender, Retik Finance\u2019s innovative features and holistic ecosystem have the potential to outshine its competitors.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nConclusion: Retik Finance\u2019s DeFi Sensation\n\nAs we look ahead to 2024, both Ethereum and Retik Finance hold promise in the world of DeFi. Ethereum\u2019s established presence and market dominance are noteworthy.\n\nHowever, Retik Finance\u2019s innovative DeFi Debit Cards, coupled with its diverse utility, cashback rewards, privacy commitment, and projected growth, position it as the DeFi sensation to watch. The potential for 2000% profits is tantalising, making Retik Finance a project worth keeping a close eye on as we enter the next phase of DeFi evolution.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Impact of a Soaring New Crypto Presale on Polkadot and Ethereum Classic Market Values - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "TLDR\n\nInvestors flock to Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) due to its impressive offers.\n\nPolkadot (DOT) is expected to surge to $7 by June 2023.\n\nAnalysts forecast that Ethereum Classic (ETC) will reach $26 in the coming weeks.\n\nPolkadot and Ethereum Classic have recorded new developments in their ecosystem that could push their values up in the coming weeks. Yet, as top altcoins like DOT and ETC look to recover from a disappointing 2023, investors are slowly turning to a new entrant, Rebel Satoshi, due to its mouthwatering offers. Read more to get the latest from the experts.\n\nPolkadot Price Prediction: DOT Expected To Rally In 2024,\n\nSpanish blockchain company Freeverse revealed on December 3 its development of LAOS, a new layer 1 blockchain slated to debut as a parachain on Polkadot in 2024. This announcement coincides with the LAOS Foundation, a Swiss non-profit established to foster the blockchain\u2019s growth through ownership of LAOS tokens in the upcoming years.\n\nAs of December 2, the price of DOT was $5.57, but it dropped to $5.55 on December 3 after the Polkadot news, signifying a 0.48% dip. However, market analysts are bullish because of the recent developments in the Polkadot ecosystem. Due to this, they predict that the value of DOT will reach $7 by the start of January.\n\nOn the other hand, with the Social Volume of DOT stagnant in recent weeks, market experts are pessimistic about the future of the DeFi coin price. They predict that DOT will drop to $5.20 by the end of the month.\n\nEthereum Classic Price Prediction: ETC Set To Experience Bullish Movement In The Coming Weeks\n\nAs of November 30, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is open to receiving comments regarding Fidelity\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF. The filing specifies that the SEC is seeking input on a proposed rule change by Cboe BZX. Approval of this rule change would enable the exchange to trade shares of Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Fund. This would affect the Ethereum ecosystem and its forks like Ethereum Classic.\n\nAs of November 30, the price of ETC was $18.64, but it rose to $19.82 on December 3, signifying a 6.33% increase. Meanwhile, Ethereum Classic experts are bullish about the value of ETC because of how the massive adoption of ETH would have a ripple effect on forks like Ethereum Classic. Thus, they predict that ETC will rise to $26 by January.\n\nConversely, other analysts are bearish with the current regulatory clampdowns, which have had big effects on the crypto market in 2023. They predict that ETC will drop to $17 before the end of December.\n\nRebel Satoshi Aims To Disrupt Financial Centralization\n\nRebel Satoshi charts a visionary course for meme coins, aiming to redefine their role in the crypto landscape. Inspired by Bitcoin\u2019s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, the project seeks to reintegrate decentralization as a core principle in the crypto industry.\n\nWhile embracing its meme coin origins with humor and community fame, Rebel Satoshi distinguishes itself by providing substantial utilities. These include an NFT collection, an NFT marketplace, and coin staking, allowing community members to actively contribute to security and liquidity enhancement through $RBLZ token staking.\n\nAnalysts recognize Rebel Satoshi\u2019s multifaceted approach, positioning it as a formidable contender against established meme coins. The uniqueness of Rebel Satoshi in the crypto industry suggests its $RBLZ token could emerge as a top cryptocurrency to buy.\n\nHolding $RBLZ offers various benefits, with community members gaining token holder status through participation in the ongoing blockchain ICO. The ongoing Rebels Round 1 of its B$RBLZ presale offers tokens at $0.013. With surging demand, $RBLZ is poised to see a significant increase to $0.018 in the next round, marking a 38.46% growth from its initial value. Further, $RBLZ is set to be listed once its value reaches $0.025.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

It\u2019s clear that the crypto markets entered a bullish phase, but even with gains like these, a few platforms will likely outperform BTC and ETH in 2024.\n\nWhile the leading cryptos still offer impressive gains, their potential can\u2019t compare to emerging platforms such as Bitcoin ETF Token, Bitcoin Minetrix, and Meme Kombat. So, let\u2019s see what these cryptos offer up close to help you get the most out of your crypto investments in 2024 and beyond.\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nWhat\u2019s The Future of BTC and ETH?\n\nThe ongoing bull run for BTC and ETH has got investors far and wide excited for 2024. According to the price predictions, BTC could surpass $100,000 in 2024, reaching new all-time highs and practically doubling its current price. BTC gained over 120% in 2023, and the surge will likely continue in 2024 and even 2025.\n\nBTC is in a bull run primarily because of the rumors of introducing Bitcoin ETFs in the next few months. The official Bitcoin ETF application has been made, and everyone\u2019s eyes are on the SEC, which is expected to greenlight the trading shortly. If that were the case, traditional traders and financial experts would get access to trading BTC tokens without owning them, which would likely attract billions of dollars in capital. Ethereum is in the same situation, as Ethereum ETFs are also awaiting approval from the SEC. ETH is expected to surpass $4,500 in 2024, giving token holders about 100% returns.\n\n>>> Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nTokens Better Than BTC and ETH\n\nAs mentioned above, BTC and ETH are expected to double in value in 2024. However, while those gains will set new records, they can\u2019t compare with the potential of the three latest platforms that entered presale recently. So, let\u2019s see why you should add them to your portfolio ASAP.\n\n1. Bitcoin ETF Token \u2013 Emerging Crypto Platform As a Flagship Offer for Bitcoin ETFs\n\nBitcoin ETF Token is one of the most exciting crypto platforms to enter presale in years. It arrived just as the first information about the SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin ETFs spread throughout the crypto and financial communities. Once Bitcoin ETFs are approved, traditional financial investors can buy and sell BTC tokens without owning them. That will, of course, spread BTC adoption and attract billions of dollars in capital.\n\nBitcoin ETF token will be the first cryptocurrency to allow investors to venture into the new market, giving them a significant advantage. Moreover, the platform is designed according to the best industry practices, with excellent tokenomics and a deflationary system. Namely, 5% of all BTCETF tokens sold during presale will be burned to reduce supply and increase value.\n\nThe official Bitcoin ETF Token presale is live and has raised over $3 million already. Around 25% of the entire supply has been sold so far, so hurry up and grab your BTCETF before they are sold. The token\u2019s price increases weekly, so the sooner you invest, the higher the returns you can expect.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin ETF Now<<<\n\n2. Bitcoin Minetrix \u2013 Bitcoin Cloud-Based Stake-to-Mine Platform with Massive Potential\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is another emerging crypto platform closely tied to the world\u2019s most valuable digital asset. It\u2019s a stake-to-mine crypto platform that allows users to mine Bitcoin in a highly efficient and eco-friendly way. Users can stake their BTCMTX tokens to earn mining credits they can use to rent remote mining rigs to earn BTC tokens. Bitcoin Minetrix is able to solve the biggest challenges of mining BTC, massive hardware and electricity costs in a single swoop.\n\nMoreover, community members and token holders can manage their mining process at all times using the complementary smartphone app, and they can withdraw their BTCMTX tokens directly to their wallets. The platform is entirely built on the Ethereum network, so BTCMTX tokens are ERC-20 coins you can transfer and sell on any crypto exchange.\n\nBTC will stay the most mined crypto worldwide for the next century. Since Bitcoin Minetrix allows users to participate in the mining remotely, it is a platform that will likely keep gaining value over time. BTCMTX tokens are available in a presale that raised over $5 million. Their price will increase weekly, so invest today to get the highest returns in 2024 and beyond.\n\n>>> Buy Bitcoin Minetrix Now<<<\n\n3. Meme Kombat \u2013 Meme Coin Catering to Multiple Growing Industries with Impressive Rewards\n\nMeme Kombat is the latest addition to the meme coin market, but it offers a unique design that sets it apart from all other platforms in the niche. The project combines three multi-billion dollar industries \u2013 cryptocurrencies, gaming, and online casinos, creating a unique ecosystem with multiple reward systems.\n\nMeme Kombat is an AI-powered game where users can select their favorite online meme character and fight it against others in exciting arena battles. All battles are AI-managed, ensuring complete transparency and fairness. Users can earn MK tokens by betting on battle outcomes or completing challenges and winning matches.\n\nThe platform will have 120 million MK tokens, half of which are available in presale, which already raised over $2.7 million. If you invest today, you can stake your tokens to earn 321% in return before the tokens go live on all significant DEX listings. Visit the site and invest today to secure your spot among the earliest investors.\n\n>>> Buy Meme Kombat Now<<<\n\nFinal Words\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are in a bullish market, and if the current trend continues, they will likely double in value in 2024. However, if you want to get the highest return possible in 2024, investing in Bitcoin ETF Token, Bitcoin Minetrix, and Meme Kombat is a must, as all three platforms are expected to lead to 10x or even 100x returns next year.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Solana overtake Ethereum in the NFT market - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "Ethereum, long revered as the forerunner in NFT trading, is facing stiff competition from unexpected quarters. Bitcoin and Solana are stepping up, challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance with innovative offerings and surging trading volumes. This shift is not just a blip on the radar but a significant change, heralding a new era in the world of NFTs.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Ascendancy with Ordinal Inscriptions\n\nBitcoin has experienced a remarkable surge in its NFT trading, primarily driven by the growing popularity of ordinal inscriptions. These inscriptions allow users to mint assets resembling NFTs directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, offering a novel approach to digital collectible creation.\n\nOver the past month, this asset class has seen a staggering 500% increase in sales volume, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s figures for the same period. This surge is indicative of the market\u2019s appetite for innovative and cost-effective NFT minting methods.\n\nThe appeal of Bitcoin\u2019s ordinal inscriptions lies in their affordability and the uniqueness of having NFTs stored directly on the blockchain, unlike traditional methods where NFTs are often stored on decentralized servers like IPFS. This distinction has attracted a wider audience, expanding Bitcoin\u2019s footprint in the NFT market.\n\nSolana\u2019s Rising Tide in NFT Trading\n\nNot to be outdone, the Solana blockchain has carved out its niche, recording higher NFT trading volumes than Ethereum. This upswing is the result of a series of successful initiatives and partnerships within the network.\n\nA notable event was the liquid staking protocol Jito\u2019s airdrop, which distributed $165 million worth of tokens to users. This event coincided with a spike in Solana\u2019s NFT sales, processing nearly $15 million in transactions.\n\nThe increase in activity on Tensor, a Solana-based NFT marketplace, further underscores the network\u2019s growing influence. Speculations about potential airdrops have fueled this surge, with the \u201cTensorians\u201d collection topping the sales charts. This collection alone witnessed a 100% increase in sales volume over the past week.\n\nAmid these developments, the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection has been making waves with its online open-world game, Pudgy World Alpha, introduced at Art Basel Miami. This game allows players to control avatars resembling the penguin characters, with or without owning an NFT.\n\nThe collection\u2019s expansion into physical toys available at Walmart, each coming with a QR code for the game, exemplifies the innovative ways NFTs are bridging digital and physical worlds.\n\nThe rising interest in Bitcoin ordinals has led to a significant increase in the blockchain\u2019s mempool, reaching an all-time high. The mempool, where all unconfirmed transactions await validation, has become congested, leading to slower processing times and higher fees. This situation highlights the growing pains of a blockchain adapting to increased demand for its services.\n\nIn essence, the NFT market is witnessing a paradigm shift with Bitcoin and Solana challenging Ethereum\u2019s longstanding supremacy. This competition is fostering innovation, leading to new methods of NFT creation and trading."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nIn the ever-evolving realm of cryptocurrency, a bold claim emerges: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Retik Finance (RETIK) are destined to become the top 3 tokens in terms of market capitalization by 2024. While this prediction may seem audacious, a closer examination reveals compelling evidence supporting this potential future.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is the undeniable pioneer of the crypto space and remains a titan in the market. Its established reputation, limited supply, and growing institutional adoption solidify its position as a valuable store of value. As the world increasingly recognizes Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a hedge against inflation and a haven asset, its dominance is poised to continue.\n\nAlso, Ethereum is the powerhouse of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, and stands as the foundation for Web 3.0, the next evolution of the internet. Its robust ecosystem, vibrant community, and ongoing development efforts focused on scalability and efficiency solidify its position as a vital platform for the future of technology.\n\nFinally, Retik Finance is a rising star in the DeFi space.
