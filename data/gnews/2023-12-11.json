        "content": "On Monday afternoon, Cardano ADA/USD experienced a significant decline, dropping over 8% in its 24-hour trading period. In comparison, major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD both saw an over 6% decline in the same timeframe.\n\nWhat Happened: According to CoinGlass, ADA's open interest in the past 24 hours has declined by 14%, signaling an outflow of money from the market.\n\nCrypto analyst, Ali Martinez took to his X handle on Dec.9, pointing out that sell signals can be seen on both the 3-day and 1-day ADA charts marking a potential correction of one to four candlesticks. He went on to add, \u201cThis may just be a short-term pullback before #Cardano resumes its uptrend!\u201d\n\nThe Cardano community on Sunday celebrated the 208th birthday of Ada Lovelace, a pioneering mathematician and computer programmer. Her work laid the foundation for modern computing.\n\nWhy It Matters: With a Total Value Locked of $367.87 million, based on DefiLlama data, Cardano has managed its way into the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Notably, ADA has seen a price surge of 32.5% in its last seven-day trading session, peaking at its highest level since June 2022.\n\nThe Cardano Foundation announced the launch of a self-sovereign \u201cIdentity Wallet\u201d on Monday for managing self-sovereign identities across Cardano and other blockchain networks. The wallet, which is a W3C-compatible mobile wallet, consists of a mobile application available for iOS and Android.\n\nThe wallet supports multiple identity and credential standards, securely manages digital assets, smooth interactions with DApps on Cardano, reduces barriers to entry for new users, and provides interoperability across various ecosystems.\n\nLast week, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson tagged rapper 50 Cent on X stating that, \u201cwe are both in the same club.\u201d The message received a positive response from the Cardano community.\n\nX Rumors Lead FREYA Rally: Separately, Hoskinson took to his X handle with a picture of his pet dog, Freya, and stated, \u201cSanta Bart is coming for Christmas.\u201d The post unintentionally sparked a trading frenzy in the Freya NFT project.\n\nHe later clarified in another post on X that he was not associated with the Freya project. \"I have nothing to do with fan projects like Freya or other NFT plays. It's flattering that people make artwork about my dog or my life, but I'm not affiliated, have not done any diligence on these projects, and do not endorse them.\"\n\nNow Read: Tesla Cybertruck Early Reservation Spots Fetch Big Bucks On eBay: Would You Pay $10K To Get Yours ASAP?\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Ethereum price took a major hit like Bitcoin and dropped over $350. ETH tested the $2,000 support and is currently attempting a fresh increase.\n\nEthereum declined over 8% and broke the $2,200 support zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $2,340 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise again unless there is a close below the $2,100 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Took A Major Hit\n\nEthereum price climbed further higher above the $2,300 level. ETH even cleared the $2,350 level but the bears remained active near the $2,400 zone. A high was formed near $2,401 and there was a sharp decline like Bitcoin.\n\nThe price declined over 8% and there was a move below the $2,200 level. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $2,340 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even spiked below the $2,000 support before the bulls appeared.\n\nA low was formed near $1,980 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $2,150 and $2,180 levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,401 swing high to the $1,980 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,275 zone. The next key resistance is near the $2,300 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,401 swing high to the $1,980 low. A clear move above the $2,300 zone could send the price toward the $2,400 level. The next resistance sits at $2,450. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,500 level.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,300 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,180 level.\n\nThe next key support is $2,120. The main support is now near $2,100. A downside break below $2,200 might start an extended decline. The key support is now at $2,000, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $1,880 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 30 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,100\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,300\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Drop As Traders Get Liquidated -- Is The Market Headed For a Reversal? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nOver $400 million worth of positions liquidated in the last 24 hours across BTC and ETH.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum decreased by 11% as key resistance was reached.\n\nA Bull market correction might have started.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin reached $45,000 on December 5 and stayed there until yesterday, December 10, when it made a downturn. It fell to $40,335 at its lowest point as the week began, marking a decrease of 11%. On the other hand, Ethereum made its yearly high of $2,400 on December 9 after a downturn to $2,145, which is an 11% decrease as well.\n\nConsequently, we saw a larger amount of long positions getting liquidated. According to CoinGlass data, in the past 24 hours, 113,881 traders were liquidated, and the total liquidations came in at $403.96 million.\n\nMost were long positions with $348.62 million compared to only $55.52 million. With the prices getting overextended in the previous period and now seeing significant declines, is this an early sign of market weakness?\n\nBTC Price Analysis\n\nThe price of Bitcoin rose by 76% since its September 11 low of around $25,000. This is the start of the ending wave from the larger uptrend that started on November 21 last year.\n\nIn our previous analysis, we called for an interaction with the $45,000 area as the next significant resistance, and judging by today\u2019s rejection, it has proven to serve as such. Analyzing the wave structure in the last advancement from November 6, it seems there might be another minor attempt to continue its upward trajectory.\n\nIt came slightly short from the interaction with the level, so an upward spike above it would look likely, but it ended as a wick and quickly snapped back below it. The rise ended as it is, and now the first bull phase correction has started.\n\nIn any case, this correction will be awaited shortly, and from the current downward movement, we will see if it has already begun. This ABC correction should bring the price of Bitcoin to the $25,000 area optimally but could go lower.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nWhat\u2019s been said for Bitcoin applies to Ethereum as well. Its price was in an ascending structure from June 18 last year and most likely marked the completion of the leading diagonal, moving upward in a five-wave manner.\n\nDecember 9 high was an interaction with its ascending resistance level and ended as a rejection, displaying the same behavior as it did on two previous occasions. There could be another minor high ahead, but this chance is slim.\n\nMore likely, we saw the completion of this larger uptrend, and it is now headed to its first bull-significant correction. If so, ETH could now be sent to the $1,500 area in an ABC correction or to $1,400 if it reaches its optimal Fibonacci retracement level of 0.618.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has continuously grown since November last year and recovered significantly, showing promising signs of a starting bull market. However, before it can continue sustainably, it must establish higher support and form its first higher low.\n\nThese higher lows are the corrections we have outlined in our price chart analysis and are referred to as higher price points compared to the lows of November last year when the larger uptrend started.\n\nAs the prices are getting overextended and we are approaching the holiday season, the euphoria might cause the market to continue or attempt to rise for another push, but these corrections are imminent.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.
