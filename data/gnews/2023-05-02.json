        "title": "How to Bridge From Solana to Ethereum - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Solana has advanced significantly in the DeFi, NFT, and Web3 markets since its launch in April 2019. Hundreds of projects are currently underway in Solana, and more are soon to follow.\n\nAccording to Solana\u2019s website, \u201clow cost, forever\u201d is the company\u2019s main selling proposition. The network is engaged in direct competition with several blockchains, including Ethereum. Even though there is competition between different blockchains, users would want to bridge from Solana to the Ethereum network. Before we dive into the detailed steps on how to bridge, let us understand what is bridging.\n\nBridging in a nutshell\n\nBridging is nothing but the process of transferring tokens or coins from one blockchain to another one. This is essential as there exist multiple blockchains with each one having their native tokens or coins. The bridge helps to move the assets from one blockchain to another, making the process easier. The process exists in general, especially for cryptocurrencies that don\u2019t have cross-chain support. Bridging is possible through cross-chain bridges and sidechains, etc.\n\nInteroperability between Solana and Ethereum is a fascinating breakthrough in the field of blockchains. It allows users to effortlessly transfer assets between the Solana and Ethereum networks.\n\nNow that we have a basic understanding of bridging, let us focus on how to bridge from Solana to Ethereum.\n\nHow to bridge from Solana to Ethereum with Allbridge\n\nThere are a few options to look into while bridging from Solana to Ethereum. Let us look at how to do it with Allbridge. Allbridge helps to connect EVM networks like Polgon, and Ethereum with non-EVM chains like Solana, Fantom, and Near.\n\nFollow the steps below to bridge your tokens from Solana to Ethereum:\n\nGo to Allbridge.\n\nConnect your Solley, Phantom, or Exodus wallet.\n\nChoose the option from Solana to Ethereum.\n\nType in the address, select the number of tokens, and click on send to finalize the transaction.\n\nHow to Bridge From Solana To Ethereum using Portal\n\nPreviously known as Wormhole Bridge, Portal Bridge is another good option to go for to move assets between these blockchains. The portal also has better liquidity for various tokens. Here is how you can bridge tokens using Portal Bridge.\n\nVisit the Portal Bridge website.\n\nConnect your Ethereum and Solana wallets.\n\nChoose the token that you want to bridge from SOL and ETH networks.\n\nType in the number of tokens that you want to transfer.\n\nDouble-check and confirm the transaction.\n\nUsing a CEX\n\nWhile the above two options are available, it is also possible to do bridging using a CEX. But doing so also comes with the security risks of a CEX, which one should be wary of. Follow the steps below to bridge tokens from SOL to the ETH network.\n\nOpen your CEX account.\n\nGo to your wallet and transfer ETH from your wallet.\n\nOnce you receive the assets, convert your crypto to a native token, like SOL.\n\nWithdraw your SOL and then send it to your Solana wallet.\n\nWhile it is always better to use portals like Allbridge and Portal, CEX can also be considered as an option to do so. However, CEXs include the necessity to do KYC and submit personal information."

        "title": "Ether whale population drops after Shapella \u2014 Will ETH price sink too? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The share of Ether held by so-called whale addresses has dropped since Ethereum's Shapella upgrade in mid April, suggesting that large investors may be leaning bearish in the near term.\n\nETH whale population shrinks post-Shapella\n\nThe amount of Ether (ETH) held by addresses with 1,000-10,000 ETH, or \"whales,\" was over 14.033 million ETH on May 1, according to Glassnode data. In comparison, the count was 14.167 million ETH on April 12, when Shapella went live on Ethereum.\n\nEther whale net position change. Source: Glassnode\n\nInterestingly, a week before the Shapella upgrade, the Ether whale cohort held 14.303 million ETH, the highest amount in 2023.\n\n\"Shrimps\" only ones buying ETH since Shapella\n\nEther's price is down over 3.5% since the Shapella upgrade \u2014 suggesting that several whales may have indeed \"sold the news.\"\n\nInterestingly, other address cohorts also showed a decline, including sharks (100-1,000 ETH), fishes (10-100 ETH), crabs (1-10 ETH) and even mega-whales (10,000+ ETH).\n\nOnly shrimps (<1 ETH) accumulated during the period, with their net position slightly increasing from 1.79 million ETH on April 12 to 1.80 million ETH on May 1.\n\nEther shrimp net position change. Source: TradingView\n\nShapella enabled investors to withdraw ETH locked via staking, which some argued would increase selling pressure.\n\nSince the Shapella upgrade, investors have withdrawn over 1.97 million ETH worth around $3.6 billion, according to Beaconcha.in. Nevertheless, no major changes in cryptocurrency exchanges' ETH balances have been seen to date.\n\nEther whales vs. shrimps\n\nHistorically, fewer Ether whales typically means heightened downside risk for the ETH price.\n\nWhale activity typically acts as a leading market indicator. So, rich investors accumulating typically precedes a price rise and vice versa.\n\nThe price-to-whale positive correlation existed until March 2020, as shown in the chart below. Afterward, retail mania took over alongside the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing, and the correlation snapped.\n\nEther whale net position change. Source: Glassnode\n\nNotably, ETH rallied from $110 in March 2020 to over $4,950 in November 2021 despite the declining number of whales. The inverse correlation continued throughout the price downtrend to around $850 in June 2022.\n\nBut since then, whale holdings have risen by nearly 1 million ETH. Meanwhile, ETH's price has more than doubled to around $1,850, hinting at a possible return of the price-to-whale correlation, which would be a bullish sign for Ether.\n\nWhere can the ETH price go next?\n\nThe $2,000 level is an important psychological resistance level for ETH/USD that bulls have been unable to break despite multiple attempts in 2023.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price outlook weakens, but ETH derivatives suggest $1.6K is unlikely\n\nOn the daily chart, ETH/USD holds above the short-term support provided by its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), near $1,840. A successful rebound from here opens $2,000-$2,125 as the next upside target range in the second quarter.\n\nETH/USD daily price chart, with the 50-day EMA in red and 200-day EMA in blue. Source: TradingView\n\nConversely, a break below the 50-day EMA risks sending ETH toward its 200-day EMA near $1,670, down about 10% from current price levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Ethereum, the second-most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, has gained immense popularity recently. Because of this, many people wonder, \u201cHow do I earn free Ethereum in 2023?\u201d\n\nWhile most people are familiar with buying and selling Ethereum, few know that they can earn it for free.\n\nYes, you heard it right!\n\nYou can earn free Ethereum in 2023 by participating in various programs and activities.\n\nThe idea of earning free Ethereum may seem too good to be true, but it is not. Many crypto exchanges and blockchain networks are offering free Ethereum to attract users.\n\nYou can earn Ethereum by watching videos, completing tasks, playing games, and more.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the various ways to earn free Ethereum and help you understand its risks and limitations.\n\nSource: Bitcoinist\n\nIs It Too Good to Be True? Understanding the Risks and Limitations\n\nBefore we dive into the popular methods of earning free Ethereum, it is essential to understand their risks and limitations.\n\nFirstly, earning free Ethereum does not mean you are making a passive income. It is more of a one-time reward for completing a task or participating in a program. Therefore, it would help if you did not consider it a means of earning a regular income.\n\nSecondly, there are always risks associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain networks. While some are legitimate and trustworthy, others may not be. It is essential to do your research and make informed investment decisions.\n\nLastly, some programs may require you to provide your email address or other personal information. It is crucial to read the terms and conditions and understand how your data will be used.\n\nPopular Methods to Earn Free Ethereum in 2023\n\nNow that we have discussed the risks and limitations let us move on to the popular methods of earning free Ethereum in 2023.\n\nWatch Videos\n\nMany blockchain networks and crypto exchanges offer free Ethereum for watching videos. These videos are usually related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.\n\nYou can earn anywhere between a few cents and a few dollars for watching these videos. While it may not be substantial, it is an easy way to earn free Ethereum.\n\nComplete Tasks\n\nCompleting tasks is another popular way to earn free Ethereum.\n\nYou can participate in bounty programs, complete specific tasks like marketing, content creation, or bug reporting, and receive Ethereum as a reward.\n\nBlockchain startups and companies looking to promote their products and services usually offer these programs.\n\nPlay Games\n\nBlockchain-based games are becoming increasingly popular, and some offer free Ethereum rewards.

While it may not be substantial, it is a fun way to earn free Ethereum.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nParticipate in Airdrops\n\nAirdrops are when a blockchain network or crypto exchange offers free cryptocurrencies to its users.\n\nYou usually need to hold a specific cryptocurrency or participate in a specific program to participate in an airdrop.\n\nAirdrops can be an excellent way to earn free Ethereum, but it is essential to research the program\u2019s legitimacy before participating.\n\nHow Do I Participate in The Free Crypto Giveaway in 2023?\n\nMany blockchain networks and crypto exchanges will offer free Ethereum in 2023 as a giveaway program.\n\nTo participate, you must sign up for the program and complete specific tasks, such as referring friends or completing surveys.\n\nReading the terms and conditions and understanding the program\u2019s rules is crucial. Some programs may require holding a specific cryptocurrency or meeting other requirements.\n\nMining Ethereum on Your Phone: Is It Worth It?\n\nMining Ethereum on your phone is another way to earn free Ethereum.\n\nHowever, mining on a computer or specialized mining rig is not as profitable. Mining on your phone can drain your battery and may not be worth the rewards.\n\nMoreover, mining requires a lot of computational power, and phone mining may be insufficient. It is essential to do your research and understand the risks and limitations before mining Ethereum on your phone.\n\nConclusion: Earning Free Ethereum in 2023 is Great, But It\u2019s Important to Do Your Research\n\nIn conclusion, earning free Ethereum in 2023 is a great way to participate in crypto and earn rewards for completing tasks. There are various ways to earn free Ethereum, such as by watching videos, completing tasks, playing games, and participating in airdrops.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to understand its risks and limitations before participating in any program or activity.\n\nEarning free Ethereum is a fun way to participate in crypto and earn rewards for completing tasks.

        "title": "Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Responds to Jab by Ethereum Co-Founder - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Charles Hoskinson is once again in another controversy.\n\nThis time, an Ethereum co-founder accuses Hoskinson of contributing nothing to Ethereum.\n\nCrypto Twitter and Hoskinson reacted to the accusations.\n\nCharles Hoskinson is known to take shots at people on the internet with his controversial takes. However, this time the Cardano founder is on the other side of criticism, targeted for his contributions to Ethereum.\n\nFabian Vogelsteller, an Ethereum co-founder, accused Hoskinson of building \u201cliterally nothing for Ethereum.\u201d While the founder supposedly meant no harm, his words garnered quite a reaction on Twitter, even from Hoskinson himself.\n\nCharles Hoskinson Built Nothing?\n\nOn April 29, Fabian Vogelsteller stirred quite the controversy after tweeting a post about Ethereum Foundation members who built their blockchains. The post featured images of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson, Polkadot Founder Gavin Woods, and Lukso Founder Fabian Vogelsteller with their net worths.\n\nThe post didn\u2019t sit well with Vogelsteller, who took it upon himself to correct it. He suggested Charles Hoskinson should be removed from the picture because he was never really a founder of Ethereum and was just at the right place at the right time.\n\nTo correct this picture a little bit:@VitalikButerin is the ethereum founder, so he doesn\u2019t count. @IOHK_Charles was never really a founder of ethereum. He built literally nothing for ethereum that I am aware of. He was just early on at the right place, at the time, hanging\u2026 https://t.co/zHFV4zLANR \u2014 Fabian Vogelsteller (@feindura) April 29, 2023\n\nWhile Vogelsteller clarified he meant no offense with his words, he buttressed that he had been involved in Ethereum long before it was formed and knows very well who contributed what and when.\n\nIn response to Vogelsteller\u2019s accusations, many on Crypto Twitter quickly came to Hoskinson\u2019s defense, flooding his post with memes and replies. Some took jabs at the Lukso founder, and others shared proof of the Cardano Founder donning an Ethereum shirt and spreading the word.\n\nAfter things got out of hand, Hoskinson chimed in with his casual sarcasm.\n\nThanks Fabian. Glad to get your opinion on my worth and contributions. I suppose Switzerland just materialized out of the ether. Also given my profound incompetence, I'd love to meet the people behind Cardano. Pretty cool project to just somehow self manifest \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) April 30, 2023\n\nThe Cardano founder sarcastically thanked Vogelsteller for his comments while hinting at Switzerland and Cardano. Notably, Hoskinson registered the Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland and served as CEO before leaving to build IOG and Cardano in 2015 and 2017, respectively.\n\nThe rowdy founder left Ethereum when his vision did not align with Buterin.\n\nSoon after Hoskinson\u2019s reply, Vogelsteller again explained he meant no offense to the Cardano Founder\u2019s work or skills. Instead, he meant Hoskinson did nothing based purely on code contributions. He added he didn\u2019t plan to instigate blockchain drama.\n\nTo which the Cardano founder has yet to respond.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nIn March, Hoskinson shared that Crypto Twitter and cryptocurrency media content spread FUD instead of constructive information.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nCardano Founder Charles Hoskinson is one of the most influential figures in the Crypto community. Controversies related to the rowdy founder often reach a considerable audience. Vogelstellar could likely be using the controversy as a marketing ploy to generate interest in his project, Lukso.\n\nFAQs\n\nDid Charles Hoskinson work on Ethereum? Charles Hoskinson joined Ethereum in 2013 as one of the five founders with Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, Anthony Di Iorio, Amir Chetrit, and Jeffrey Wilcke. He served as the CEO for a short period, after which he left in 2014. When did Charles Hoskinson leave Ethereum? Charles Hoskinson left Ethereum in 2014 over a dispute with Vitalik Buterin on whether the project should be for-profit or non-profit. Hoskinson believed Ethereum should take the commercial route and become like Google, whereas Buterin believed the project should be modeled after Mozilla, a non-profit organization. Hoskinson went on to form IOHK and Cardano. Will Cardano ever replace Ethereum? Ethereum is a long-established network and powers a wide range of Layer-2 products, giving it the second-largest market capitalization of $227 billion. In contrast, Cardano has taken an intentionally slow, dev-focused approach to its blockchain. Despite being heralded for its consistency, the project has drawn scrutiny for falling behind, which is evident in the poor growth of its market cap. At $13 billion, Cardano has a long way to go in replacing Ethereum. What is Charles Hoskinson saying about Cardano? Charles Hoskinson believes Cardano still has a lot of building to do and is about 85% complete. He explains that many delays and issues surrounding Cardano can be attributed to focusing on the wrong technology and being too ambitious with its roadmap. Hoskinson plans to expand Cardano\u2019s reach in West Africa, with Ghana as a prime focus.\n\nRead more about Charles Hoskinson\u2019s other controversies:\n\nCharles Hoskinson Calls Competition \u2018Ignorant\u2019 on Cardano Security\n\nMajor auction house Sotheby\u2019s released a new NFT Marketplace:\n\nSotheby\u2019s Launches New NFT Marketplace on Ethereum and Polygon"
