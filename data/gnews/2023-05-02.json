        "summary": "  Ether whale population has decreased since Ethereum's Shapella upgrade, suggesting that large investors may be leaning bearish in the near term. The share of Ether held by addresses with 1,000-10,000 ETH, or \"whales,\" dropped from 14.033 million ETH on May 1 to 14.167 million ETH on April 12. Only shrimps (<1 ETH) accumulated during the period, with their net position slightly increasing. The Shapella upgrade enabled investors to withdraw ETH locked via staking, which some argued would increase selling pressure. Since the upgrade, over 1.97 million ETH worth around $3.6 billion has been withdrawn, but no major changes in cryptocurrency exchanges' ETH balances have been seen. Historically, fewer Ether whales typically means heightened downside risk for the ETH price. However, the price-to-whale positive correlation existed until March 2020, and the inverse correlation continued throughout the price downtrend to around $850 in June 20"

The Ethereum network has seen over a million ETH withdrawn from validators, but most are being re-staked. The future of staking services in the US is uncertain, with centralized exchanges like Coinbase facing regulatory battles. The SEC's efforts to curtail staking service providers may force retail staking to move offshore, leading to a regulatory void that could be exploited by bad actors. Decentralized staking services may become more popular, but it remains to be seen how US-based service providers will respond to the SEC's guidance and securities laws."

        "summary": "  The size of a blockchain is an important issue, as it affects the scalability and performance of the network. The current size of the bitcoin blockchain is around 250 GB, and it is expected to reach 1 TB by 2030. However, not every node needs to download the entire blockchain to become operational, and some nodes are referred to as \"full nodes\" that download the entire data set to validate transactions. The size limit for bitcoin blockchains is 1 MB, but some of the space inside this limit is unusable. The size of the Ethereum ledger is expanding at a faster rate than that of bitcoin, and it has issues with scalability and size as well. The consequences of a large blockchain size include slower transactions, longer time to solve a block, and increased storage costs. Startups developing applications on Ethereum and bitcoin should not be concerned with the scale of the blockchain at this time, as Ethereum already has pruning, which reduces the amount of blockchain data required by a complete node."
