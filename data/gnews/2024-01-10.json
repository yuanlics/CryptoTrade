Despite the activity, Santiment reports that the sentiment around ETC remains \u201cneutral for now.\u201d\n\nSee More: Dogecoin HODLERs Are Beating Shiba Inu With 57% Landing In Profits, IntoTheBlock Data Reveals\n\nWhy It Matters: The crypto market has been riding a wave of optimism ever since BlackRock, the financial heavyweight, filed documentation in June aiming to launch a Bitcoin ETF \u2014 a product that would directly hold Bitcoin as opposed to derivatives based on the cryptocurrency.\n\nSome investors perceive ETC to be a cheaper Ethereum play, which has resulted in rallies in the cryptocurrency when Ethereum moves higher.
