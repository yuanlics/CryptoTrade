        "content": "Ethereum Spot ETFs Could Be Next, According to Bloomberg Analyst\n\nWith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on January 10, the path is now clear for spot Ethereum ETFs to be approved in 2024, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\nBalchunas believes there is a 70% chance that spot Ether ETFs will be approved by May, the month the SEC must make a final decision for several applications. Balchunas previously stated that he could not see a scenario where spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved but spot Ether ETFs are not. He compared the two cryptocurrencies, saying that \"Ether spot is tied to the hip of Bitcoin spot.\"\n\nThe earliest deadline for spot Ethereum ETFs decision is in May later this year for VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF. BlackRock\u2019s deadline is in August, however if the SEC does approve, it could approve all applicants like it did for the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nPrior to the SEC's spot Bitcoin approval, Valkyrie Funds' chief investment officer Steven McClurg said he wouldn't be surprised if spot Ether and XRP ETFs come to market after Bitcoin. Several major asset managers, including BlackRock, VanEck, ARK Invest & 21Shares, Fidelity, and Invesco Galaxy, have filed applications for spot Ether ETFs. The SEC must make decisions on these applications by various dates ranging from May 23 to August 7.\n\nFollowing the Bitcoin ETF approval, Ethereum (ETH) gained 8.5% over the past 24 hours, and rallied over 15% in the past week, breaking above the $2.5K level, as investors speculate on the potential of a spot Ether ETF approval.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nA crypto whale, or a large holder with a significant amount of cryptocurrency, just made a large purchase of 4,677 ETH, valued at roughly $11 million, according to data from Lookonchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe interesting thing about this purchase is that it seems to reflect a bold bullish bet on the Ethereum price.\n\nThis whale appears to be bullish on ETH and bearish on BTC, according to Lookonchain. Surprisingly, the whale exchanged his wrapped Bitcoin for Ethereum, borrowing 241 WBTC worth $11 million from Aave, which he exchanged for 4,677 ETH.\n\nWhile the real intentions of the whale remain unknown, indications point to the fact that the whale expects the price of ETH to rise shortly.\n\nEthereum outperforms Bitcoin\n\nExpectations for Bitcoin ETF approval are rising, and eyes are currently on Ethereum, which is presently outperforming Bitcoin at the moment.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 2.11% in the last 24 hours to $45,647, following seesaw price activity in yesterday's trading. Ethereum, on the other hand, was up by 5.47% in this same time frame to $2,422.\n\nThis outperformance is causing Ethereum to rise against Bitcoin on multiple time frames. According to Matthew Hyland, a crypto analyst, this is not surprising, as both the BTC Futures in 2017 and the Coinbase IPO in 2021 saw ETH outperform BTC shortly after.\n\nWhile bullish expectations remain for the ETH price, it should be kept in mind that past performance does not guarantee future results.\n\nOn the other hand, legendary trader Peter Brandt retains a bearish bias from the standpoint of a swing trader rather than a \"hodler.\"\n\n\"My bias remains to be short ETH,\" Brandt said in a tweet, noting his belief that the Ethereum chart lacks underlying strength."

As of the most recent update, the live price of Rocket Pool stands at $31.76, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume of $22 million, revealing a 14.9% increase in Rocket Pool\u2019s value over the last 24 hours.\n\nRounding out the third spot is Arbitrum (ARB), which stands out as an Ethereum layer-two (L2) scaling solution, employing optimistic rollups to enhance speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness within the Ethereum network. As of the latest data, the live price of Arbitrum is currently $1.94, accompanied by a 12.1% increase in value.\n\nWith the market experiencing significant volatility this week in response to ETF updates, investors are making many big moves in the crypto space.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Ethereum price climbed higher above the $2,350 resistance. ETH outpaced Bitcoin and might even attempt a clear move above the $2,400 resistance.\n\nEthereum is attempting a fresh increase above the $2,350 resistance level.\n\nThe price is trading above $2,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key rising channel forming with support near $2,300 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a fresh surge if there is a close above the $2,400 level.\n\nEthereum Price Starts Increase\n\nEthereum price formed a base above the $2,220 level and started a fresh increase. ETH saw a sharp upward move despite a drop in Bitcoin below $46,500. The price gained pace for a move above the $2,300 and $2,320 levels.\n\nIt even broke the $2,350 resistance and tested the $2,400 zone. A high was formed near $2,399 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor drop below $2,360. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $2,243 swing low to the $2,399 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $2,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key rising channel forming with support near $2,300 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nIf there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $2,380 level. The next major resistance is now near $2,400. A clear move above the $2,400 level might send ETH toward $2,440. A close above the $2,440 resistance could start a decent upward move.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key resistance is near $2,550. If the bulls push Ethereum above $2,550, there could be a rally toward $2,720. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,800 zone.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,400 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,320 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $2,243 swing low to the $2,399 high.\n\nThe first key support could be the $2,300 zone. A downside break and a close below $2,300 might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,240 support.

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, currently shows a lack of bullish momentum contrary to the generally bullish sentiment around Bitcoin spot ETFs. The ETH price has been resonating between the $2400 and $2140 horizontal levels for the past five weeks, with the overhead supply preventing the buyers from a higher rally. Will potential approval from the US SEC bolster the Ether price to escape this uncertainty?\n\n$2400 Breakout Will Trigger a Direction Rally\n\nA steep support trendline leads to the current recovery trend in the ETH price.\n\nA potential recovery may face new resistances at $2680 and $3000\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $20.8 Billion, indicating a 68% gain.\n\nAn ascending trendline in the daily time frame chart shows the Ethereum price recovery is intact and the current sideways trend is likely a post-rally consolidation to recuperate the exhausted bullish momentum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the Ethereum whales have accumulated nearly $1 billion worth of Ether despite its underperformance relative to Bitcoin. A recent tweet from renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez reveals that the Ethereum smart money has significantly increased its holdings by accumulating more than 410,000 ETH tokens during the past month(December).\n\nThis accumulation amid the crypto market\u2019s progress towards the first spot Bitcoin ETF hints the ETH may also witness a major impact of US SEC approval as the potential for spot Ethereum ETF will also accelerate.\n\nBy press time, the ETH price shows a 3.77% jump and teases a bullish breakout from the $2400 resistance level. If buyers succeed in closing a daily candle above this barrier, it could lay a solid foundation for additional upward movement.\n\nSuch a breakout could potentially result in a 10% rise in ETH, setting its next target at around $2,680. Following this, a prolonged recovery could target the $3,000 and $3280 mark.\n\nThis Support Prevents ETH From Major Correction\n\nOver the past two months, the ETH price has been receiving dynamic support from an ascending trendline. The coin price rebounded several times from this support indicating the buyers are actively accumulating at a dip which is a key sign of sustainable recovery. Thus, it also indicates losing this support could intensify selling pressure and trigger a new correction in this asset.\n\nBollinger Band: An uptick in the upper boundary of the Bollinger band indicator suggests the bullish momentum is strengthening.\n\nAverage Directional Index: A low value of ADX(15%) hints the ongoing consolidation has managed to offer buyers sufficient break to kickstart a new rally.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "title": "Ready For Liftoff: Ethereum Eyes Breakthrough As Analyst Signals Upward Trend - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is currently at a crossroads that could define its trajectory in the coming weeks. Renowned crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has shared a notably bullish perspective, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s approach to its 2022 low as a potential springboard for a breakout.\n\nIn his analysis, Van de Poppe underscores the importance of Ethereum\u2019s current positioning, suggesting that its proximity to last year\u2019s low could be a catalyst for absorbing liquidity and igniting a bullish trend.\n\nAnalyst\u2019 Ethereum Bullish Projection Amid Market Movements\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s forecast hinges on the broader market context, particularly the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. Should this approval materialize, he anticipates a significant impact on the ETH/BTC trading pair, potentially leading to a liquidation candle \u2013 a sharp price movement.\n\nSubsequently, Van de Poppe predicts a substantial shift in market dynamics with funds rotating into Ethereum. This move, he believes, will be accompanied by a \u201cbullish weekly divergence,\u201d setting Ethereum on an upward trajectory.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there. If an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we\u2019ll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum appears to be struggling to catch up with Bitcoin\u2019s price performance. It recently surpassed the $2,300 mark, echoing Bitcoin\u2019s surge above $47,000 \u2013 its highest since April 2022.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has seen a slight retracement and is currently trading around $2,249. This slight dip comes amid a week when the asset experienced a 5.8% decline, contrasting with its significant trading volume surge from $13 billion last Tuesday to over $23 billion today.\n\nUpward Swing With Potential Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nThe critical factor in Van de Poppe\u2019s analysis is the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US. The market is on edge, with major players like BlackRock leading the spot ETF race alongside others like Grayscale Investments, Valkyrie, and ARK 21Shares.\n\nThese firms have recently submitted updated 19b-4 filings for their proposed Bitcoin ETFs, with the market sentiment heavily leaning towards a positive outcome.\n\nBlackRock just re-filed their S-1 based on last min comments given yesterday. Hard to tell what has changed at first glance, but imp thing is that the unheard of 24hr turnaround time bt filing, comments and re-filing tells us all parties aiming to get this show on road pronto. pic.twitter.com/61cPtGJ4Oy \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 9, 2024\n\nBlackRock, in particular, has stirred significant optimism in this spot Bitcoin ETF race. With an approval decision expected by January 10, tomorrow, such a development could bolster Bitcoin and catalyze a fund rotation into Ethereum.\n\nVan de Poppe isn\u2019t alone in his bullish stance on Ethereum. Crypto Tony, another prominent crypto analyst, shares a similar outlook. Tony posits that Ethereum\u2019s path to a bullish phase could commence if it maintains above the key level of $2,130.\n\nCurrently trading above this crucial point, Ethereum\u2019s stability at or above this level is considered a sign of market strength, potentially paving the way for future gains. Furthermore, a push towards and above the $2,500 mark could significantly bolster Ethereum\u2019s bullish momentum, as highlighted by Crypto Tony.\n\n$ETH / $USD \u2013 Update The ETH range is simple. Remain above $2,130 and we are bullish .. Reclaim the range high at $2,500 and we are really bullish pic.twitter.com/YKOph2YbRY \u2014 Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 8, 2024\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ethereum price briefly broke past the $2,400 mark on Jan. 10, up 10% within the weekly time frame, ahead of the much-anticipated Bitcoin ETF Approval.\n\nThe crypto market experienced widespread volatility on Jan 9 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced false Bitcoin (BTC) ETF approval in a now-denounced post on X.\n\nDespite the raging controversy, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has maintained a steady uptrend, trading as high as $2,440 on Jan. 10.\n\nEthereum vs Bitcoin: Crypto derivatives traders are betting bigger on ETH\n\nBetween Jan. 7 and Jan. 10, Ethereum\u2019s 11% price growth performance has dwarfed Bitcoin\u2019s 4%. Interestingly, vital derivative market metrics now suggest that ETH price could further outperform BTC if the SEC issues a timely positive verdict on Bitcoin Spot ETFs.\n\nFirstly, the funding rate represents the interest paid by bullish traders to inverse traders to keep their LONG futures contract positions open. As of morning trading hours Eastern time on Jan. 10, ETH currently has a Funding rate of 0.014%, which marginally exceeds currently exceeds BTC\u2019s 0.12%\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs Bitcoin (BTC) Funding Rate | Source: Coinglass\n\nPut concisely, a higher positive funding rate in Ethereum than in Bitcoin implies increased demand for long positions in the ETH derivatives market, potentially reflecting a more optimistic sentiment.\n\nIn further confirmation that Ethereum price could outperform Bitcoin, the open interest dynamics have also flashed similar signals since the week\u2019s turn.\n\nYou might also like: Bloomberg ETF analyst: Bitcoin ETF to be approved today\n\nETH open interest growth has outpaced BTC\n\nETH Open Interest has increased by 14.6% from $3.71 billion at close on Jan. 7 to $4.57 billion at the time of writing on Jan 10. Meanwhile, BTC open interest has witnessed only a 5% boost, from $6.4 billion to $7.3 billion during this period.\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs. Bitcoin (BTC) Open Interest | Source: Velo Data\n\nOpen interest represents the dollar value of all active futures contracts for a specific cryptocurrency. An increase in open interest implies more new entrants are bringing fresh capital than those closing out their positions.\n\nThe chart above clearly illustrates that the percentage increase in ETH has outpaced Bitcoin\u2019s open interest amid intense speculation on the spot BTC ETF verdict. This affirms that crypto traders are betting on Ethereum to deliver larger price gains in the days ahead.\n\nWill ETH reach $3,000 after BTC ETF approval?\n\nDespite Bitcoin pulling more media traction, the current ETH Funding rate and Open Interest trends imply that crypto traders anticipate higher price gains in Ethereum after a positive ETF verdict. If this scenario continues, ETH\u2019s price will likely reclaim the $2,500 territory.\n\nHowever, IntoTheBlock\u2019s in/out of the money around price (IOMAP) data, which groups the current ETH holders by their historical entry points, shows a major resistance sell-wall around the $2,475 range.\n\nThe IOMAP depicts that 567,150 addresses have acquired 398,810 ETH at the average price of $2,475.\n\nGiven that this cluster of holders has been holding at a loss for nearly two years, they could rapidly book profits as ETH price approaches their break-even point again.\n\nBut if the derivative traders continue doubling their bullish positions as depicted by the elevated ETH funding rates, Ethereum\u2019s price could break above $2,500 for the first time since May 2022.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast, Jan. 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nConversely, if a material market even sends ETH price into a down trend, the $2,200 support level could be crucial.\n\nAs seen above, the 2.85 million addresses that had acquired 7.7 million ETH coins at the minimum price of $2,220 could mount a formidable buy-wall to avert a prolonged Ethereum price downswing.\n\nRead more: SEC approves spot Bitcoin ETF on accelerated basis\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "After the Bitcoin ETF Fakeout: Ethereum ETH Price Soars - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) rallied past the key $2,400 level this week as traders speculated on the approval of a potential Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization gained over 5% in 24 hours to hit its highest level since last September.\n\nKeypoints\n\nEther price surged past $2,400 as traders bet on a potential Ether ETF following Bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nBlackRock previously filed for an Ethereum Trust ETF which added to speculation of an Ether product.\n\nTokens like LDO, RPL, MNT, and OP also rallied as they are connected to Ethereum and could benefit from an ETF.\n\nAnalysts say Ether looks positioned for a breakout with a bullish chart pattern targeting $3,500 if resistance around $2,320-$2,382 is broken.\n\nDespite market chaos from fake Bitcoin ETF tweets, Ether price still managed to surge due to strong fundamentals and on-chain data.\n\nDriving the bullish sentiment was previous news that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, had filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an Ethereum Trust ETF. The proposed \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust\u201d would allow mainstream investors easy exposure to spot Ether prices.\n\nWhile Bitcoin ETF approvals are widely expected this year, the BlackRock filing added credibility to hopes for an Ether product as well. This is significant because an SEC-approved crypto ETF would bring in fresh institutional capital from pension funds, endowments, and traditional finance players.\n\nAlong with Ether, native tokens of Ethereum-based protocols also benefited from the ETF speculation. For example, staking tokens Rocket Pool (RPL) and Lido DAO (LDO) notched double-digit percentage gains. As staking rewards are a prime feature of Ethereum\u2019s shift to proof-of-stake consensus, an influx of new demand from an ETF could be a boon for staking platforms.\n\nOn the technical analysis front, Ether\u2019s bullish chart signals also reinforced the positive fundamentals. According to analyst World of Charts, ETH appears to be consolidating in a \u201cbullish pennant\u201d pattern that has an ultimate target of around $3,500. To confirm this breakout, traders first want to see resistance levels at $2,320\u2013$2,382 convincingly taken out.\n\nThe promising on-chain data also buoyed market confidence in Ether\u2019s uptrend. Blockchain intelligence firm Santiment reported that the number of large \u201cwhale\u201d transactions on Ethereum rocketed higher in the past day. This suggests that deep-pocketed investors still have an appetite to accumulate more ETH at these levels.\n\nRemarkably, Ether managed to post gains despite the wider crypto market reeling from fake news of a Bitcoin ETF approval. A series of forged tweets from a hacked SEC account initially sent Bitcoin spiking before a swift plunge once the ruse was uncovered. Still, Ethereum proved resilient with its strong fundamentals and held onto daily gains of nearly 4%.\n\nWith ETF excitement building, technicals flashing bullish signals, and whales continuing to stockpile, analysts broadly agree further upside appears in store for Ether. The next key resistance level to watch is the psychological $2,500 mark, which opens the door to test $3,000 and beyond. As long as crypto adoption trends remain intact, Ethereum looks poised to continue outpacing the broader digital asset market."

According to World Of Charts, Ethereum shows consolidation within a bullish pennant pattern.\n\nThis technical formation typically suggests continuing an upward trend in Ethereum\u2019s case. According to the analyst, if Ethereum successfully breaks out of this pattern, it could surge toward a significant level of $3,500.\n\n$Eth Trend Is Up Consolidating In Bullish Pennant Expecting Breakout Soon Incase Of Successful Breakout Expecting Move Towards 3500$#Crypto #Eth #Ethusdt #Ethereum pic.twitter.com/nlqbMfh3k0 \u2014 World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) January 10, 2024\n\nCrucial Resistance Zone: Ethereum Path To Breakout\n\nAdding to World Of Charts\u2019 optimistic outlook, crypto trader Skew has identified the $2,320\u2013$2,382 range as a key resistance zone for Ethereum. This price range has historically acted as a barrier to Ethereum\u2019s upward movement, with \u201cnumerous rejections\u201d witnessed at these levels.\n\nSkew emphasizes the importance of Ethereum closing above $2,400 on the 1-hour and 4-hour charts.

This bullish trend is further supported by increased trading volume, which surged below $30 billion to approximately $39 billion in the past day.\n\nSkew suggests that Ethereum\u2019s bullish momentum could receive an additional boost from the potential approval of a Spot BTC ETF. If such approval were to come to fruition, it could further support Ethereum\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, another renowned crypto analyst, who also foresees Ethereum\u2019s approach to its 2022 low as a precursor to a potential breakout. Van de Poppe believes that Ethereum\u2019s current positioning near last year\u2019s low could be crucial in absorbing liquidity and fueling a bullish breakout.\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s analysis highlights the broader market context, specifically the awaited decision on a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US. An approval, he predicts, could notably impact the ETH/BTC trading pair, potentially triggering a sharp price movement known as a liquidation candle.\n\nFollowing this, Van de Poppe anticipates a significant reallocation of funds into Ethereum, accompanied by a bullish weekly divergence, propelling Ethereum onto an upward trajectory.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

So I would keep an eye on that in case there are any bounces.\n\nBut I still think that there\u2019s a good chance that we are just emulating what happened over here [in December 2017] and that we are about to enter this phase of the cycle [similar to 2019-2020] where support finally breaks [at the 0.049 BTC level], it comes down into these levels over here, finds some type of a bottom [at around 0.037 BTC], goes sideways for a while and then maybe by the end of the year starts trending back up [to 0.049 BTC].\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.049 BTC ($2,298) at time of writing.\n\nCowen acknowledges that the ETH/BTC pair has both lower highs and higher lows in the weekly time frame, which makes it difficult to predict the trading pair as bullish or bearish.\n\n\u201cHow best to explain Ether/Bitcoin higher lows is perhaps on some type of logarithmic regression curve. And it is important to point out the higher lows\u2026\n\nBut one concerning aspect are these lower highs. We can look at the higher lows, and a lot of people point to that\u2026\n\nI look at these lower highs and think, where\u2019s this thing ultimately heading? It\u2019s putting in lower highs, but it\u2019s also putting in higher lows. The truth is I don\u2019t know what the ultimate outcome of this is.

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum Classic price formed a double-top reversal pattern that hints at a 21% decline.\n\nPrice indicators highlight the potential of the pattern failing due to bullish broader market cues.\n\nThe anticipated spot Bitcoin ETF approvals will likely have a bullish impact on altcoins, benefiting ETC.\n\nEthereum Classic price was seemingly adhering to the micro bearish reversal pattern, which failed despite the recent correction in the crypto market. The short-term outlook ahead of the spot Bitcoin ETF approval is now looking bullish as ETC is bouncing back from the crucial support of $19.33.\n\nEthereum Classic price notes a bearish reversal pattern\n\nEthereum Classic price on the 4-hour scale invalidates the double-top bearish reversal pattern that has been observed in the past four weeks. This pattern consists of two peaks or tops of nearly identical height positioned closely together, with a trough in between. It suggests a possible shift in market direction.\n\nThe potential trend reversal is indicated by the price encountering a resistance level on two separate occasions without successfully surpassing it. This is often interpreted as a sign to consider selling or initiating short positions as further declines in the market.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum Classic, this double top was formed at $23.42, with the neckline or support level of the pattern being marked at $19.33. This is also the breakout level, and an extended decline below this line would confirm the bearish reversal pattern. Furthermore, a successful pattern would only be observed when ETC falls to the target price of $15.24, which, according to the pattern, would register a 21% decline on the 4-hour chart.\n\nHowever, Ethereum Classic price took the other route and, instead of falling through the neckline, bounced off it to note minor recovery, trading at $19.90 at the time of writing. Although this does not rule out the potential for decline, the price indicators do suggest invalidation of the pattern is likely, too.\n\nETC/USD 4-hour chart\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator are giving out mixed signals, with the former still sitting in the bearish zone and the latter noting a bullish crossover.\n\nEthereum Classic RSI and MACD\n\nIf Ethereum Classic price continues the current path and broader market bullish cues kick in, ETC could move sideways or upwards beyond $20 and invalidate the bearish pattern.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Ethereum namesake falls through the neckline and falls below $19, the bullish thesis would be invalidated, and the reversal pattern could be deemed mildly successful since absolute success would warrant a 21% correction."

        "content": "It has been a volatile week in the altcoin market so far, with most coins currently in the red.\n\nHowever, Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) have bucked this trend, showcasing impressive resilience amid the broader market downturn.\n\nEthereum Eyes Breakout as Trading Volume Spikes\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading around the $2,430 level \u2013 just below last week\u2019s high.\n\nETH has posted two bullish daily closes in a row and looks to be heading for a third if the current momentum can be sustained.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, ETH\u2019s price is still trapped in a range between $2,150 and $2,450 \u2013 a range that has been in play since early December.\n\nHowever, the recent bounce from the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) on the daily time frame suggests that the token could be positioned to break out of this range to the upside.\n\nSpot trading volume for ETH has soared 35% in the past 24 hours as investors look to get involved before any breakout occurs.\n\nThis uptick in trading volume has come at the same time as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ticking into \u201cExtreme Greed\u201d territory.\n\nAs such, all of the necessary factors are there for ETH to potentially make a run back to December\u2019s yearly high in the coming days.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Continues to Post Presale Gains as Stake-to-Mine Feature Catches Attention\n\nAlongside Ethereum, another altcoin that\u2019s making progress while the market struggles is Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).\n\nUnlike ETH, Bitcoin Minetrix is not yet listed on the open market and is still in its presale phase \u2013 yet has just passed the $8 million funding milestone.\n\nInvestors have been piling into the presale in recent weeks due to the discounted price of BTCMTX that\u2019s on offer.\n\nCurrently, investors can buy BTCMTX tokens for just $0.0127 \u2013 although this price is only available for one more day before increasing by 8% in the next stage.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale has seen enormous traction, mainly due to the project\u2019s groundbreaking Stake-to-Mine feature.\n\nThis feature enables everyday crypto users to stake BTCMTX tokens and earn \u201ccloud mining credits\u201d as a reward.\n\nThese cloud mining credits can then be used to mine Bitcoin \u2013 significantly streamlining the mining process.\n\nGiven that the Bitcoin mining sector is expected to be valued at over $4.7 billion by 2028, this Stake-to-Mine setup has the potential to tap into a significant and growing market.\n\nMore than 16,500 people now follow Bitcoin Minetrix on Twitter, demonstrating the growing interest in the project\u2019s features.\n\nWith a stellar roadmap containing plans for a dedicated mobile app and cloud mining partnerships, Bitcoin Minetrix could be an altcoin with an exciting future ahead.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nSEC ETF Confusion Triggers Altcoin Selloff\n\nAlthough Ethereum and Bitcoin Minetrix are performing well, most coins in the altcoin market are currently experiencing a downturn.\n\nInvestor sentiment appears to have shifted bearish in the past 24 hours, leading to price drops for leading altcoins like Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP).\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) has been one of the worst-hit altcoins, dropping over 8% in the past 24 hours alone.\n\nThis bearish trend appears to be linked to the ongoing confusion around whether a spot Bitcoin ETF will be launched in the US or not.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the SEC\u2019s official Twitter account was hacked, leading to a fake tweet being posted that said a spot ETF had been given the green light.\n\nHowever, shortly after, SEC chair Gary Gensler announced this was incorrect and that a spot BTC ETF had not yet been approved.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this led to chaos in the crypto market, causing the price of Bitcoin to rally and then drop.\n\nThe volatility spread to the altcoin space, contributing to the sell-off in major coins and tokens.\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

This report highlights that he had previously declared an investment of up to $45,000 in Ether during 2023.\n\nFinancial Disclosure Reports Database submitted by Mike Collins\n\nCollins reported investments in Ethereum totaling $110,000 as part of his mandatory financial reports to Congress under the STOCK Act on January 9, 2024.\n\nHis recent transactions include purchasing Ethereum worth $15,000 on January 3 and an additional $50,000 on January 8. This active engagement in cryptocurrency trading dates back to at least 2023.\n\nThe reports align with an 11% rise in Ethereum\u2019s market value over a week. This increase may be linked to expectations about the U.S. SEC\u2019s decision on a Bitcoin ETF."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction as Inflows Surge to $29 Million \u2013 Can ETH Hit $5,000 This Month?\n\nThe Ethereum price has bounced by 5% in the past 24 hours, hitting $2,411 as the cryptocurrency market as a whole has actually dipped by 0.1%.\n\nETH\u2019s move today means it is now up by 1.5% in a week and by 7.5% in the last 30 days, with the biggest altcoin in the market also sitting on an 81% gain in the past year.\n\nThese moves come as weekly Ethereum inflows top $29 million, according to the latest CoinShares data, making ETH the most popular altcoin among funds.\n\nAnd with the market hoping for a big surge in the event of Bitcoin ETF approvals today, the Ethereum price could rally strongly very soon.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction as Inflows Surge to $29 Million \u2013 Can ETH Hit $5,000 This Month?\n\n\n\nMore than most other major coins, ETH really looks like it\u2019s on the brink of making strong price gains in the next few days.\n\nIts RSI (purple) has just risen back up to 60, a sure sign of increasing momentum, particularly after the indicator dropped below 50 a few days ago.\n\nAt the same time, ETH\u2019s 30-day average is climbing more steeply again after slacking in recent days, another indicator that buying pressure is growing for the coin.\n\nOne of the encouraging signs as far as ETH is concerned, is that its support level (green) has risen consistently in recent weeks, implying that even if it doesn\u2019t rally continuously, it\u2019s not going to fall hard anytime soon.\n\nAnd as the latest CoinShares report makes clear, ETH is the most popular alt in the market this week, with its inflows comfortably exceeding those of its nearest rival, Cardano (ADA).\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 2024 is off to a strong start, with US$151 million in inflows! Total inflows since the Grayscale vs SEC lawsuit now stand at US$2.3 billion. Notable asset inflows include:$BTC: US$113m inflows$ETH: US$29m inflows$ADA: US$3.7m inflows$AVAX: US$2m inflows$LTC: US$1.4m\u2026 pic.twitter.com/9wfshmqxsB \u2014 CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) January 8, 2024\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the market is getting excited about ETH because it could be one of the main beneficiaries in the event that the SEC approves Bitcoin ETFs today, which many think is likely.\n\nIf the regulator does approve Bitcoin ETFs, it\u2019s possible that Ethereum ETFs could follow sooner or later, something which would obviously be a major win for Ethereum.\n\nYet Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals are so strong that it\u2019s more than capable of continuing to rise with ETFs.\n\nIt still accounts for more than half of the total value locked of the entire crypto sector, with the platform attracting the biggest adopters last year, including PayPal and Coinbase.\n\nAs such, 2024 is likely to be another good year for the Ethereum price, which could hit $3,000 in the next few months.\n\nOther High-Potential Altcoins for Big Gains\n\n\n\nTraders looking for lower cap alternatives to ETH may be interested in looking at newer alts and presale tokens, which can often rally big when listing on exchanges for the first time.\n\nOne coin likely to do this is Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF), a deflationary ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised close to $5 million in its presale, which has now closed.\n\nMajor players like @BlackRock, @ARKInvest, and more are adjusting their filings for a US #Bitcoin #ETF, now leaning towards cash redemption over in-kind transactions. The #SEC's stance signals a shift. What's your take on this regulatory move?#BitcoinETF hits beyond the $4.8\u2026 pic.twitter.com/bxixnW8m3T \u2014 BTCETF_Token (@BTCETF_Token) December 19, 2023\n\nDespite its sale running for only a short period of time, Bitcoin ETF Token was able to raise so much money because of its highly deflationary tokenomics.\n\nNamely, the coin set to burn 25% of its max supply over the course of its lifespan, burning this amount in five 5% instalments, as well as through a transaction tax.\n\nThe first of these will come when an SEC-approved Bitcoin ETF gains a trading volume of more than $100 million, and with the SEC likely to approve its first ever BTC ETF today, this milestone could arrive sooner rather than later.\n\nBy burning 25% of its supply, Bitcoin ETF Token will experience steadily rising demand, which could push its price up increasingly higher.\n\n#BitcoinETF Token Announcement! \ud83d\udce3 We can proudly announce that around 21 million #Tokens worth over $100K have been burnt through transaction taxes! This is also the equivalent of #Bitcoin's total supply! \ud83c\udf10 pic.twitter.com/D8z2nvj4rG \u2014 BTCETF_Token (@BTCETF_Token) January 3, 2024\n\nWhile its presale has now closed, participants can begin to claim and stake their purchased tokens.\n\nAnd given that holders can stake BTCETF, it could end up being a very deflationary token, with much of its original supply being taken out of circulation.\n\nIn turn, its tokenomics could help it have one of the biggest exchange listings of the year, so new investors are advised to act quickly once it does list.\n\nVisit Bitcoin ETF Token NowDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

As a platform for decentralized applications, there\u2019s just so much infrastructure and activity around the world. Bitcoin is a narrower technology but it\u2019s a reasonably mature technology so they\u2019re both prime candidates.\n\nSolana is a great technology but it\u2019s not a mature ecosystem yet.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Today, we continue our two-part article series on Ethereum apps. To recap, we reveal 10 Ethereum apps to watch in 2024. These 10 apps all serve very different purposes. And, I\u2019m sure that you, as a user, will find one that\u2019s just right for you.\n\nBefore we begin, do check out the first part of this article series here. If you\u2019ve done so, let us check out App #6 below.\n\n6) Daylight\n\nNumber 6 of the Ethereum apps we\u2019re watching in 2024 is Daylight. Daylight\u2019s main product is an Application Programming Interface (API). In short, an API provides a way for two programs to talk to each other. Daylight\u2019s API does just that, for:\n\nWallets.\n\nTools.\n\nCreators.\n\nPost-transaction recommendations are now live on @daylight! After someone transacts, we surface the top 3 mints they are most likely to do based on our relevance data: social graph, holdings, etc. Next year, we will power this in our app partners to increase engagement. pic.twitter.com/Q3JAMXleJc \u2014 Kyle McCollom \u2600\ufe0f (@kylemccollom) December 22, 2023\n\nBut, what does Daylight\u2019s API do exactly? Well, its API focuses on recommendations. For instance, let\u2019s say you mint an NFT from a collection. With this data, Daylight\u2019s API recommends another three other NFT collections that you may like. Hence, you\u2019ll find more NFTs that suit your preference.\n\nDaylight isn\u2019t just for NFTs though. Said API can be integrated within wallets or apps. In turn, this creates a lot of potential use cases. With your transaction data, Daylight helps you find more of what you like in crypto.\n\n7) Dookey Dash\n\nNumber 7 of our 10 Ethereum apps is Dookey Dash. The creator of this game is the renowned Yuga Labs. Yes. That\u2019s the same team behind blue-chip NFT projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks.\n\nI love to play with numbers. In some of these games, I concede defeat when trying to achieve top ranks. So, I make self-achievements like matching my lb rank with token ID. Got close with @yugalabs #DookeyDash REAL close with @10KTFshop Bell rankinghttps://t.co/taQOZqc2eX pic.twitter.com/8Vzfykwqsk \u2014 \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc0d (@CDNHODLer) January 5, 2024\n\nIn summary, Dookey Dash is an NFT game. One that is simple but requires skills and reflexes. As you can see from the video above, you\u2019ve got to dodge a ton of obstacles. At the same time, you\u2019ve got to collect items too. The longer you last in the game, the higher the points you get.\n\nSadly, the game is not open to the public at the moment. But, you can follow the Yuga Labs Twitter account. Once the game is back, they\u2019ll announce it. You can then try it out first-hand.\n\n8) Unlonely\n\nNow, if you aren\u2019t into just having fun yourself, check out Unlonely. It\u2019s one of the more fun Ethereum apps you can use. That\u2019s because it links you up with others on the livestream. So, it\u2019s similar to a \u201cWeb 3 Twitch\u201d platform. Indeed, any lonely person with this app will for sure feel \u201cUnlonely\u201d.\n\nwe\u2019re cooking\u2026 let us cook \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83e\udd0c if you\u2019re new to love on leverage and weren't able to catch everything live (or just miss us too much already), here\u2019s a one stop shop to tide you over until the next one \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/7IFCPz2vcS \u2014 \ud83d\udfe2 Live on Unlonely (@unlonely_app) October 18, 2023\n\nWell, of course, Unlonely isn\u2019t all about just watching each other online. You can participate in prediction markets too! All while on the live stream. So, you can bet if a couple will go on another date or not. Or, you can bet on live sports results. The possibilities are endless here. Hence, if you frequently use Twitch, do check Unlonely out too!\n\n9) Hypersub\n\nNext is Hypersub, one of many NFT Ethereum apps. Hypersub is an NFT subscription platform. But unlike other apps, it has a special feature that you might or might not like. It grants NFT creators the ability to add an expiration date to their NFTs. So, you could be the owner of an NFT you like, but only for a limited time.\n\n9. hypersub @withfabricxyz a nft subscription platform. although still nascent, i think the idea of adding a time expiration for creators is really special. creators usually get the short-end of the stick when offering \"lifetime\" access to their offering. pic.twitter.com/DGwWeVzscj \u2014 0xDesigner (@0xDesigner) December 28, 2023\n\nWith this feature, Hypersub can attract many NFT creators. Two of which showcase their work in the above tweet.\n\n10) Spinamp\n\nLast but not least, we\u2019ve got Spinamp. It\u2019s a leading project amongst music Ethereum apps, simply because it works well.

        "content": "According to disclosure documents filed with the U.S. House of Representatives, Georgia Representative Mike Collins purchased up to $65,000 worth of Ether (ETH) in 2024.\n\nAccording to a Jan. 9 filing with the House\u2019s Financial Disclosure Reports Database, Rep. Collins revealed he had purchased up to $15,000 worth of ETH on Jan. 3 and up to $50,000 worth of the token on Jan. 8. The U.S. lawmaker has been trading ETH since at least 2023 according to similar filings, reporting total purchases up to $110,000.\n\nSource: Financial Disclosure Reports Database, U.S. House of Representatives\n\nUnder the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act, U.S. lawmakers are largely required to report investments to Congress. However, they are still permitted to oversee or propose legislation on matters potentially related to their investments, which many have called a potential conflict of interest between their public service and personal wealth.\n\nCollins\u2019 ETH purchases came as the token\u2019s price surged more than 11% in the last seven days, from roughly $2,200 on Jan. 3 to $2,466 at the time of publication. Some experts have speculated that ETH could rally in response to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission potentially approving a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund for the first time \u2014 an event expected by Jan. 10.\n\nRelated: US lawmakers introduce bipartisan bill proposing ban on members investing in \u2018financial instruments\u2019\n\nThe disclosure filings came roughly nine days before the U.S. government is set to shut down should Congress fail to pass a spending bill before Jan. 19. Previous shutdowns have created ripples across markets, including cryptocurrencies, partly due to economic uncertainty.\n\nRepublican Party candidates for the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election will face off in Iowa on Jan. 10 for the first debate of the election season. Pro-crypto candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who polled roughly 6% in Iowa, will not appear on the debate stage against Florida Governor Ron Desantis and Nikki Haley.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market: Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "content": "Valkyrie CIO Says Market May See Ripple, Ethereum ETFs Next\n\nValkyrie Funds Chief Investment Officer Steven McClurg says it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if a Ripple and Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) came to the market speaking in an interview with Bloomberg TV.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we saw Ripple or Ethereum spot ETFs out there,\u201d said McClurg. The CIO went on to add that Grayscale recently added XRP to their publicly traded which in turn shows that there is interest.\n\nMcClurg believes that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will approve spot Bitcoin ETFs on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe SEC will deem the ETFs effective at close of business Wednesday and the trading to begin on Thursday morning,\u201d McClurg said in an interview.\n\nDozen Applications in Pipeline\n\nSo far, there are nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETF hopefuls who are significantly dropping their management fees in hopes of beating out their competitors, yet another sign of imminent approval.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, Fidelity lowered their fees to 0.25% from the previous 0.39% and has offered a fee waiver to 0% through July 31.\n\nIncluding Fidelity, 5 out of the 11 issuers have revised their fee structures or offered temporary waivers after they received feedback from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 8.\n\nWith the previously lowest fee of 0.24% offered already, Bitwise reduced it to 0.20% with a waiver to 0% for 6 months or 1 billion; Wisdomtree lowered its fee of 0.50% to 0.30% also with a waiver to 0% for 6 months or 1 billion.\n\nSEC\u2019s X Account Hacked\n\n\n\nEarlier today, when the SEC\u2019s X account shared a false tweet suggesting the approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF in the US. The excitement in the crypto community was short-lived as Chair Gary Gensler quickly revealed that the SEC\u2019s X account had been compromised, and the tweet was unauthorized.\n\nFollowing the false SEC announcement, the cryptocurrency market was marked by heightened sensitivity to regulatory actions, Bitcoin\u2019s price experienced a notable dip to $46,000, reflecting nearly 1.50% decrease on Wednesday."

        "content": "A fake approval post from the SEC regarding a Spot Bitcoin ETF sent shockwaves through the crypto market, impacting both Bitcoin and Ethereum Open Interest (OI). In addition, this incident triggered a volatile day for Bitcoin prices, which in turn led to a significant drop in Bitcoin Futures Open Interest (OI).\n\nHowever, amid a slip in Bitcoin OI, the Ethereum Futures Open Interest witnessed an unprecedented surge, indicating a shift in market sentiment.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum OI Soars As BTC Faces Backlash Amid Fake ETF Approval Drama\n\nThe SEC found itself embroiled in controversy after an unauthorized post on its official X handle falsely claimed approval for a Spot Bitcoin ETF. This misinformation sparked enthusiasm among crypto enthusiasts, only to be quelled when SEC Chair Gary Gensler clarified that no such approval had been granted, revealing a compromised official handle.\n\nMeanwhile, as a consequence, the crypto community expressed strong dissatisfaction, accusing the U.S. SEC of market manipulation. Notably, according to CoinGlass data, Bitcoin Futures Open Interest plummeted by 3.29% over the last 24 hours to 431.76K BTC or $19.69 billion, reflecting the impact of the misleading information on investor confidence.\n\nIn contrast, while Bitcoin faced a downturn, Ethereum emerged as a resilient player in the market. Ethereum Futures Open Interest witnessed an impressive surge of 12.08% over the past 24 hours, reaching 3.33 million ETH or $8.05 billion. This surge was mirrored on various platforms, with Binance recording a 10.39% increase and Bybit experiencing a remarkable 16.07% jump in Ethereum OI.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock and ARK 21Shares Slash Bitcoin ETF Fees In New S-1 Filings\n\nPrice Changes Amid Market Turbulence\n\nThe crypto market was down on Wednesday, which several experts attributed to the recent SEC chaos. Meanwhile, as of writing, the global crypto market cap was down 1.14% to $1.71 trillion, while the trading volume ticked up 2.81% to $83.95 billion.\n\nNotably, the Bitcoin price was down 3.74% to $44,915.91 during writing, after hitting a high of $47,898.70 in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, the Ethereum price noted gains of 3.17% over the last 24 hours and traded at $2,371.42. Notably, the ETH has touched a high of $2,410.96 today.\n\nMeanwhile, this contrasting performance between Bitcoin and Ethereum indicates a dynamic shift in investor sentiment. As Bitcoin grapples with the aftermath of the fake spot Bitcoin ETF approval saga, Ethereum appears to be gaining momentum, attracting renewed interest and investment within the crypto space.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Delists BTC, ETH, BNB, LTC, FLOKI Spot Trading Pairs"

        "title": "Experts set a date for Ethereum to reach $10k, are you ready? - Crypto Reporter",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has long been a favourite among crypto enthusiasts and investors. Over the years, ETH has seen significant price appreciation, but the question on everyone\u2019s mind is, can it reach $10,000?\n\nAccording to crypto analyst and author Chris Burniske, the answer is a resounding \u201cyes,\u201d and he\u2019s not alone in his optimism. In this article, we\u2019ll delve into the journey Ethereum has taken so far and explore the factors that could propel it to the coveted $10,000 mark. Additionally, we\u2019ll introduce a promising token, Retik Finance (RETIK), as a project to watch in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Remarkable Ascent\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the \u201cking of smart contracts,\u201d has had a remarkable journey since its inception. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as digital gold and a store of value, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain platform is designed to support decentralised applications (DApps) and smart contracts. This fundamental difference has opened up a world of possibilities and applications, making ETH an indispensable part of the crypto ecosystem. Ethereum\u2019s price history tells a compelling story of growth and adoption. It began trading at just a few cents when it launched in 2015, and by 2017, it had breached the $1,000 mark. The subsequent years saw its price surge to new heights, with ETH reaching an all-time high of over $4,800 in November 2021. This impressive price trajectory underscores Ethereum\u2019s significance and potential in the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nChris Burniske\u2019s Bold Prediction\n\nChris Burniske, a respected crypto analyst and author, shared his thoughts sometimes back on Ethereum\u2019s future in a Twitter post. He expressed his astonishment at the persistent scepticism surrounding ETH\u2019s potential, despite its consistent price appreciation. Burniske boldly stated, \u201cFor the haters that have been negative on ETH at $1, $10, $100, and $1,000, but refuse to let data change their view, see ya at ETH $10,000.\u201d While Burniske doesn\u2019t anticipate Ethereum reaching this milestone in the next few months, he firmly believes that it\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens. He set his sights on the year 2025 as the timeframe for Ethereum to hit $10,000, a prediction that has garnered significant attention and sparked optimism among ETH supporters.\n\nCommunity Consensus\n\nBurniske\u2019s prediction resonated with many members of the crypto community, and their responses to his post indicate widespread agreement. Some Ethereum enthusiasts even go a step further, suggesting that ETH could reach $10,000 as soon as 2024. The sentiment among believers is that Ethereum\u2019s fundamental value proposition, combined with its growing adoption and use cases, makes a five-figure price tag entirely plausible in the coming years.\n\nFactors Fueling Ethereum\u2019s Growth\n\nSeveral key factors contribute to the bullish outlook for Ethereum and its potential journey to $10,000:\n\nSmart Contracts and DApps: Ethereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities are at the heart of its appeal. The platform enables developers to create decentralised applications, opening up a wide range of use cases in finance, gaming, NFTs, and more. As the DApp ecosystem continues to expand, demand for ETH to power transactions and interact with these applications will likely grow.\n\nEthereum Upgrade: The Ethereum Cancun upgrade, which is expected to happen in Q1 of 2024, will increase the scalability, security, and efficiency of the Ethereum network, optimising operation and reducing gas fees through a process known as proto-danksharding.\n\nDeFi and NFTs: The decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors have exploded in recent years, with Ethereum serving as the primary platform for these innovations. The growing popularity of DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces drives demand for ETH as the preferred choice for transactions and collateral.\n\nInstitutional Adoption: Ethereum has attracted the attention of institutional investors, with major financial institutions and corporations exploring its potential. Institutional investment can bring significant liquidity and credibility to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nRetik Finance: A Promising Token to Watch\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s journey to $10,000 is on the horizon, the crypto landscape is continually evolving, with new projects emerging to address various needs and challenges. One such project that has been gaining traction is Retik Finance (RETIK). As we look ahead to Ethereum\u2019s potential growth, it\u2019s essential to keep an eye on promising tokens like RETIK. Retik Finance is a decentralised finance (DeFi) project that aims to redefine the DeFi space by introducing innovative utilities that bridge the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. Its ecosystem includes features like the Retik Wallet, Retik DeFi Debit Card, and Retik Pay, all designed to simplify financial transactions and promote accessibility to DeFi for users of all backgrounds. The project\u2019s presale stages have been a resounding success, raising over $6.7 million from the sale of over 134 million tokens. With experts predicting gains of up to 20,000%, Retik Finance is poised to make a significant impact in the crypto world.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we embark on the journey into 2024 and beyond, Ethereum\u2019s path to $10,000 remains an exciting narrative in the crypto space. Chris Burniske\u2019s bold prediction, combined with the strong fundamentals and growing adoption of Ethereum, instils confidence in its potential to reach this milestone. While Ethereum takes center stage, it\u2019s crucial to keep an eye on promising projects like Retik Finance (RETIK), which are innovating and offering solutions to the evolving needs of the crypto community. As Ethereum\u2019s journey unfolds, it\u2019s clear that the crypto landscape holds immense opportunities for those who dare to dream and believe in the transformative power of blockchain technology.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\nDisclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the content provider and do not necessarily represent those of Crypto Reporter.
