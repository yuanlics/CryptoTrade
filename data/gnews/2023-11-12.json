        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum and Polygon are experiencing a remarkable surge in large-scale transactions, also known as \"whale transactions.\"\n\nNotably, Bitcoin has seen an 80% increase in transactions valued over $100,000.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum's large transactions have soared by 170%, while Polygon has witnessed an unprecedented rise of over 3,800% compared to their respective volumes just 30 days ago.\n\nLarge transactions\n\nData from the past week highlights the scale of this uptick in high-value transactions. Bitcoin recorded 16,410 transactions in the last 24 hours, peaking at 22,570 transactions on Nov. 9. The lowest was 12,810 transactions on Nov. 5.\n\nIn terms of transaction volume, Bitcoin saw $24.4 billion in the last 24 hours, with a high of $39.02 billion and a low of $18.1 billion within the same week. Ethereum's large transaction count stood at 3,560 in the last 24 hours, reaching a seven-day high of 7,590 transactions and a low of 3,040.\n\nIts transaction volume echoed this trend, with $2.91 billion in the last 24 hours, peaking at $6.59 billion and a low of $2.47 billion.\n\nFor Polygon, the number of large transactions reached a seven-day high of 209 transactions, the same as its count in the last 24 hours, with a low of 34 transactions. The transaction volume mirrored this surge, with the last 24 hours seeing $194.42 million, a seven-day high of $357.59 million and a low of $28.81 million.\n\nRenewed institutional demand\n\nThe significant increase in whale transactions across these cryptocurrencies is largely attributed to renewed institutional interest. The crypto market is abuzz with anticipation for the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs by January 2024, a development that is expected to further fuel institutional demand.\n\nAdditionally, BlackRock's plans to introduce a spot Ethereum ETF have added to this excitement. Institutional demand plays a crucial role in the crypto market, as it not only brings substantial capital but also lends credibility and stability to the digital currency ecosystem.\n\nThe entry of large financial players and the creation of more accessible investment vehicles like ETFs are seen as key drivers for long-term growth and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "A trader who nailed the top of the 2021 Bitcoin (BTC) bull market believes rallies are in sight for Ethereum (ETH) and one additional altcoin.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 711,700 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum looks poised to take out a resistance level that has held for over a year.\n\n\u201cA few thoughts on ETH here.\n\nIt didn\u2019t come this high to not take out the yearly highs at the very least.\n\nMight let some shorts build up first in that area tho to build liquidations\n\nIf BTC ETF (exchange-traded fund) is approved, good chance ETH rallies harder seeing as it\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, Ethereum\u2019s long-term resistance level appears to be at $2,144. At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $2,038.\n\nAnother altcoin on the trader\u2019s radar is the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused Fetch.ai (FET). According to Pentoshi, FET will likely skyrocket once it takes out resistance at $0.49.\n\n\u201cIf it reclaims $0.49, this going to $0.69 in my opinion.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, FET is worth $0.413.\n\nPentoshi is also keeping a close watch on TOTAL 3, which tracks the total market cap of crypto excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to the trader, TOTAL 3 looks bullish and still has more room to move to the upside before hitting a resistance level, suggesting that altcoins could see more rallies in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cStill a ways to go next few weeks overall. Sharp pullbacks are gifts.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, TOTAL 3 is trading at $406.356 billion.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Macro guru Raoul Pal says that the top smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) is set to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) as the crypto markets enter into a new \u201cspring\u201d phase.\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs executive tells his one million followers on the social media platform X that based on the Tom Demark Sequential indicator, ETH is setting up to outrun BTC.\n\nThe Demark Sequential aims to identify points of trend exhaustion or price reversal.\n\n\u201cThat is the weekly DeMark 9 count for the ETH/BTC cross. ETH most likely outperforms from here as per usual at this stage in late Crypto Spring.\u201d\n\nPal goes on to say that Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will be the \u201choly grail\u201d for asset managers, at least until some form of competition emerges.\n\n\u201cAn ETH ETF is the holy grail for asset managers as they can capture the yield and only give price performance to the ETF holders. It is a super profitable business until it gets competed away eventually.\u201d\n\nHowever, one prominent crypto analyst has a stance that contradicts Pal\u2019s assessment of Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin.\n\nRecently, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen issued an alert, saying that Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) \u2013 which tracks the percentage of the total market cap that belongs to Bitcoin \u2013 will continue to be bullish, meaning that altcoins, including ETH, will lag behind BTC.\n\n\u201cMy crypto portfolio for the last couple of years has been predominantly just Bitcoin because I suspect that it will outperform most of the rest of the market \u2013 not all of the market, but most of the rest of the market \u2013 and that\u2019s why the dominance has gone higher.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,080 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The biggest asset management firm in the world is challenging the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), contending that spot market Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are no different than futures ETFs.\n\nIn a new filing, investment titan BlackRock \u2013 which has over $8 trillion in assets under management \u2013 says that the regulatory agency should approve spot market crypto ETFs as it has already greenlighted futures ETFs.\n\n\u201cGiven that the Commission has approved ETFs that offer exposure to ETH futures, which themselves are priced based on the underlying spot ETH market, the Sponsor (BlackRock) believes that the Commission must also approve ETPs (exchange-traded products) that offer exposure to spot ETH, like the Trust.\u201d\n\nAccording to BlackRock, the SEC is misusing the Investment Company Act of 1940 by applying it to spot ETFs.\n\n\u201cWhile the 1940 Act has certain added investor protections that the 1933 Act does not require, these protections do not seek to allay harms arising from underlying assets or markets of assets that ETFs hold, such as the potential for fraud or manipulation in such markets.\n\nIn other words, the Sponsor does not believe that the application of the 1940 Act supports the purported justifications the Commission has made in denying other spot digital asset ETPs.\n\nThe 1940 Act explicitly lists out the types of abuses it seeks to prevent, and places certain restrictions related to accounting, borrowing, custody, fees, and independent boards, among others.\n\nNotably, none of these restrictions address an ETF\u2019s underlying assets, whether ETH futures or spot ETH, or the markets from which such assets\u2019 pricing is derived, whether the CME ETH futures market or spot ETH markets.\u201d\n\nBlackRock concludes that the distinction created by the SEC between futures ETFs and spot market ETFs is arbitrary.\n\n\u201cThe Sponsor believes that the distinction between registration of ETH futures ETFs under the 1940 Act and the registration of spot ETH ETPs under the 1933 Act is one without a difference in the context of ETH-based ETP proposals.\u201d\n\nLast week, BlackRock registered its iShares Ethereum trust in the state of Delaware, a move similar to the firm\u2019s registration of its Bitcoin trust.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s revenue hit $10 billion as demand for ETH increased over the week.\n\nNetwork activity also rose but transactions later dropped.\n\nETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, had tongues wagging over the course of the just-ended week. This was because BlackRock filed for an Ethereum ETF, triggering a breakout for ETH as the coin rose above $2,000.\n\nAs expected, the increase led the broader market to assume that it is the altcoin season to shine. But while the market was fixated on the price action, the Ethereum blockchain was also hitting landmarks that it had previously dropped from.\n\nReturns get back to the highs\n\nOne such milestone was the Ethereum revenue. Eric Smith, Chief Investment Officer at 401 Financials, posted that the revenue had hit $10 million again. From the data coined from Token Terminal, the last time the Ethereum blockchain hit such levels was in July.\n\nETH price wasn\u2019t the only thing that was up yesterday. Ethereum\u2019s one day revenue hit $10 million for the first time since July. \ud83d\udcc8 via @tokenterminal pic.twitter.com/hw2wZdVtoO \u2014 Erik Smith, CFP\u00ae (@eriksmithcfp) November 10, 2023\n\nFor the unfamiliar, Ethereum makes its revenue mainly from network fees it charges users of the blockchain. Hence, the increase in revenue means that there was a surge in activity on the blockchain during the week.\n\nThe surge in revenue also means that there must have been an increase in the average gas price. According to information from Etherscan, ETH\u2019s average transaction fee tapped 57.1 on 9th November.\n\nThe Ethereum gas measures the amount of computational effort required to make transactions on the network. It also serves as a way of incentivizing validators on the blockchain. For context, validators are people responsible for keeping the Ethereum network working.\n\nActivity rises, then dips\n\nThis value was the highest in the last 30 days, meaning that there was an increase in demand for ETH. Elsewhere, Ethereum\u2019s network growth rose to 78,500. Network growth shows the number of new addresses being created on the blockchain.\n\nWhen the metric increases, it means user adoption is growing on the network. A decrease implies that traction has reduced. So, the initial jump suggests that new addresses were transacting actively on Ethereum.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nBut at the time of writing, the network growth had dropped to 29,300. Like the network growth, active addresses on the Ethereum network also climbed to 459,000 on 10 November. Active addresses show the level of interaction or speculation around a token.\n\nTherefore, the metric at that time means that deposits on the network were at impressive levels. However, the press time state of the active addresses showed that the metric had decreased.\n\nLooking at the current state of Ethereum, the drop in gas fees has affected the revenue. Going forward, to surpass the $10 billion, the demand for ETH needs to increase more than it has recently."
