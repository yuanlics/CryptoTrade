        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission delayed its deadline to make a decision on Fidelity's proposal for a spot Ethereum ETH +1.07% exchange-traded fund until March 5, according to a filing on Thursday.\n\n\"The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\" the SEC said.\n\nFidelity applied for the Fidelity Ethereum Fund in November, noting in its proposal a court ruling last year where judges said the SEC failed to find a coherent reason on why it should reject spot crypto ETFs when it had allowed futures-based products.\n\nThe SEC will now have more time to decide whether to approve, disapprove or institute proceedings.\n\nDelay had been expected\n\nBloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said the SEC's move to delay was expected.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"Fidelity #ethereum ETF delayed just now. Completely expected. Dates that really matter are late May in my view,\" Seyffart wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe SEC last week authorized 11 spot bitcoin ETFs to begin trading, sparking some in the industry to wonder if a spot Ethereum ETF is next.\n\nFidelity joined fellow giant BlackRock late last year in the race for a spot Ethereum ETF. A month before those firms applied for the spot products, ether futures ETFs went live.\n\n\"The fact that they allowed listing of the futures based ETFs is enough to say they are thinking about ether the same way they are thinking about bitcoin and you can infer from that they're probably thinking it's not a security and not going to regulate it that way,\" Stuart Barton, co-founder at Volatility Shares, said last week."

        "content": "Blobs are live on Goerli.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Goerli testnet successfully forked to \u201cDencun,\u201d featuring the \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d EIP-4844 innovation.\n\nThat paves the way for two more major testnet forks, keeping on schedule, for now, a further move to Ethereum mainnet by the end of March.\n\nThe consensus coming out of Thursday\u2019s All Core Devs meeting was to prepare a new software version by mid-next week. This could be used for both the Sepolia and Holesky testnets, slated for Jan. 30 and Feb. 7, respectively.\n\nDencun\u2019s concept of \u201cblobs\u201d is a key component of the upgrade, and refers to a large piece of data that is not directly included in an Ethereum block but is instead referenced by the block.\n\nBy including extra data for transactions, Ethereum will better serve rollups that use mainnet for data availability. Rollups are expected to see around a 90% cost savings, which they will pass on to users in the form of cheaper transactions.\n\nRead more: Dencun and Pralectra: Ethereum core devs chart an ambitious 2024\n\nEven though the data in blobs is stored off-chain, the integrity and availability of this data are still maintained. Blobs are designed to be cryptographically secure, ensuring that the data they reference is immutable and verifiable.\n\nClient diversity wins the day\u2026again\n\nA minor consensus issue in the popular Prysm client caused the forked chain to encounter difficulty finalizing blocks.\n\nTerence Tsao, protocol developer at Offchain Labs, which develops the Prysm client, estimated the resulting delay at about four hours while the team patched the problem.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\n\u201cWhen Prysm upgraded from Capella to Deneb state, we kept the historical route empty instead of carrying it over, so this issue was fairly easy to find,\u201d Tsao told colleagues on the ACD call.\n\nThe bug didn\u2019t show up in the many Devnets (developer networks) run over the past few months because these are forked from testnets and contain insufficient history to trigger the issue.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those very rare edge cases,\u201d Tsao said. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for Goerli, because otherwise we probably wouldn\u2019t have caught it until later.\u201d\n\nPrysm now operates on less than 40% of Ethereum network nodes, so the resulting drop in validating participation rates, if it happened on mainnet, would be bad, but not catastrophic.\n\nIn fact, a similar incident occurred in May, showcasing the benefit of client diversity.\n\nRead more: Ethereum devs issue final report on finality SNAFU\n\nGoerli itself is scheduled to be retired following this month. The Ethereum Foundation and other developers have been encouraging users to transition to the newer Sepolia testnet, which will serve as the primary testnet for dapp developers in preparation for Goerli to be shut down.\n\nAnother testnet, Holesky, launched in September 2023 and is intended more for infrastructure and protocol development.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Hole\u0161ky testnet launch hits a speed bump\n\nThe Prysm bug was the only major client issue observed in the wake of the fork, and one which can be easily avoided in the future according to Danny Ryan, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, who nevertheless called it \u201ca failure\u201d that \u201cshould be caught way upstream.\u201d\n\nRyan said he intends to spend some time \u201cmaking sure there\u2019s nothing else funky on the fork boundary test.\u201d\n\nClient teams expressed no reservations about sticking to the previously outlined release and testnet schedule, pending the results of the next fork in less than two weeks\u2019 time.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

It\u2019s similar to Bitcoin but with added functionalities, such as the ability to build decentralized applications, also known as dApps.\n\nthat enables the creation and execution of smart contracts. It\u2019s similar to Bitcoin but with added functionalities, such as the ability to build decentralized applications, also known as dApps. Ethereum, often referred to as the world computer , has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance, supply chain management, and even online gambling.\n\n, has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance, supply chain management, and even online gambling. With its robust infrastructure and advanced features, Ethereum provides a solid foundation for the development of innovative and transparent gambling platforms.\n\nNow that we have a basic understanding of Ethereum, let\u2019s delve deeper into how Ethereum casinos work. Ethereum casinos leverage the power of smart contracts to offer transparent and provably fair gambling experiences. These smart contracts act as the backbone of the casino, ensuring that every transaction is secure and tamper-proof.\n\nWhen a player interacts with an Ethereum casino, they are essentially interacting with a smart contract. This smart contract contains the rules and logic of the game, eliminating the need for a centralized authority to oversee the gambling process.\n\nThe transparency of the blockchain ensures that all transactions and outcomes can be verified by anyone, providing a level of trust that traditional online casinos often lack.\n\nOne of the key advantages of Ethereum casinos is the ability to verify the fairness of the games. Traditional online casinos rely on random number generators (RNGs) to determine game outcomes. However, these RNGs are often centralized and can be manipulated by the casino operator. In contrast, Ethereum casinos use cryptographic algorithms to generate random numbers, making it virtually impossible for the casino to cheat or manipulate the results.\n\nEthereum casinos offer a higher level of security compared to their traditional counterparts. With traditional online casinos, players often have to trust the casino operator with their funds, leaving them vulnerable to hacks or mismanagement. In contrast, Ethereum casinos store funds in smart contracts, which are secured by the blockchain\u2019s robust encryption. This means that players have full control over their funds and can be confident that their money is safe.\n\nAnother exciting aspect of Ethereum casinos is the ability to earn and use cryptocurrency within the gambling ecosystem. Many Ethereum casinos have their own native tokens eg ( RollBit & Lucky Block), which can be used for betting, receiving bonuses, or even participating in the governance of the platform. This adds an extra layer of utility and value to the gambling experience, allowing players to benefit from the growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum casinos offer a new and innovative approach to online gambling. By leveraging the power of smart contracts and the transparency of the blockchain, these casinos provide a secure and fair gambling environment. With the ability to verify game outcomes, enhanced security measures, and the integration of cryptocurrency, Ethereum casinos are poised to disrupt the traditional online gambling industry.\n\nBenefits of Using Ethereum in Online Casinos\n\nThere are several advantages to using Ethereum in online casinos. Let\u2019s explore a few:\n\nSpeed and Efficiency\n\nOne of the key advantages of using Ethereum in online casinos is the speed at which transactions can be processed. Unlike traditional payment methods, which may take days to settle, Ethereum transactions are almost instantaneous. This means that you can start playing your favorite casino games in no time!\n\nImagine you\u2019re sitting at home, eager to try your luck at an online slot machine. With Ethereum, you won\u2019t have to wait for hours or even days for your deposit to be confirmed. Instead, the transaction will be processed within seconds, and you can start spinning those reels right away. The fast and efficient nature of Ethereum transactions ensures that you won\u2019t miss a single moment of the gaming excitement.\n\nSecurity and Anonymity\n\nWhen it comes to online gambling, security and anonymity are of utmost importance. Ethereum casinos provide an added layer of security by leveraging the decentralized nature of the blockchain. Every transaction made on the Ethereum network is recorded on multiple computers, making it nearly impossible for hackers to manipulate or tamper with the data.\n\nFurthermore, since Ethereum transactions don\u2019t require you to enter personal information, your identity remains anonymous, protecting your privacy. This anonymity is especially crucial for those who prefer to keep their gambling activities private. With Ethereum, you can enjoy the thrill of online gambling without worrying about your personal information falling into the wrong hands.\n\nLower Transaction Fees\n\nTransaction fees can quickly eat into your gambling budget. With Ethereum casinos, you can say goodbye to hefty transaction fees. Since Ethereum operates on a peer-to-peer network, the fees associated with transactions are significantly lower compared to traditional payment methods.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re a frequent online gambler who enjoys playing various casino games. With traditional payment methods, you may have to pay a substantial amount in transaction fees over time. However, with Ethereum, the fees are minimal, allowing you to allocate more of your funds towards actual gameplay. This means more spins, more bets, and ultimately, more chances to win big!\n\nCriteria for Ranking Ethereum Casinos\n\nWhen it comes to ranking Ethereum casinos, we consider several factors to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. Here are some of the criteria we take into account:\n\nCasino Reputation and Trustworthiness\n\nAbove all, we prioritize your safety. We thoroughly research the reputation and trustworthiness of each Ethereum casino before placing them on our top picks list. This includes reading player reviews, checking for any past security breaches, and assessing the overall trustworthiness of the casino.\n\nOur team goes beyond just checking the surface-level information. We delve deep into the history of each casino, looking for any red flags or concerns that may affect your gaming experience. We believe that trust is the foundation of any successful casino, and we want to ensure that you can play with peace of mind.\n\nAdditionally, we consider the licensing and regulatory compliance of each casino. It is important to us that the casinos we recommend operate within the legal framework and adhere to industry standards. This ensures that you are playing in a fair and secure environment.\n\nVariety of Games Offered\n\nA good Ethereum casino should offer a wide range of games to cater to all types of players. From classic table games like blackjack and roulette to modern slots and live dealer games, variety is key. We assess the game selection of each casino to ensure that you have a plethora of options to choose from.\n\nOur team of experts examines the quality and diversity of games available at each Ethereum casino. We look for popular titles from reputable software providers, as well as unique and innovative games that can enhance your gaming experience. Whether you\u2019re a fan of traditional casino games or prefer the excitement of cutting-edge slots, we strive to find casinos that offer something for everyone.\n\nFurthermore, we consider the availability of mobile gaming options. In today\u2019s fast-paced world, being able to play your favorite casino games on the go is essential. We evaluate the mobile compatibility of each casino, ensuring that you can enjoy seamless gameplay on your smartphone or tablet.\n\nQuality of Customer Support\n\nCustomer support can make or break your experience at an Ethereum casino. We test the responsiveness and helpfulness of each casino\u2019s customer support team to ensure that you\u2019ll receive prompt assistance whenever you need it.\n\nOur team simulates various scenarios to gauge the effectiveness of customer support. We reach out with inquiries and assess the speed and accuracy of the responses received. We also evaluate the availability of different support channels, such as live chat, email, and phone support, to ensure that you can easily reach out for help.\n\nAdditionally, we consider the availability of multilingual support. We understand that not all players speak English as their first language, so we look for casinos that offer customer support in multiple languages. This ensures that language barriers do not hinder your gaming experience.\n\nFurthermore, we take into account the availability of comprehensive self-help resources, such as FAQs and knowledge bases. A good casino should provide you with the tools and information you need to resolve common issues on your own, without having to rely solely on customer support.\n\nBy considering all these factors, we aim to provide you with a thorough evaluation of Ethereum casinos. Our goal is to help you make an informed decision and find the perfect casino that meets your needs and preferences.\n\nAnd there you have it \u2013 our top picks for the best Ethereum casinos. Whether you prioritize speed, security, or game variety, there\u2019s an Ethereum casino on our list that\u2019s sure to meet your needs. Happy gambling!\n\nFAQs"

        "title": "Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Price May Outperform Bitcoin Recovery in Near-Term - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has exhibited a notable bullish trend since the second week of January. This period coincided with the much-anticipated approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETF, a development that significantly contributed to Ethereum\u2019s price surge from $2,170 to $2,714. In contrast, Bitcoin displayed continued volatility during this period. As previously reported by Coingape, there was a substantial increase in whale accumulation for Ethereum in December 2023. This trend suggests that \u2018smart money\u2019 investors showed a greater inclination towards Ethereum over Bitcoin, despite a historical milestone.\n\nWill Bitcoin continue to rise as Ethereum ETF could be the next topic of investor\u2019s focus?\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Project Strength for Prolong Recovery.\n\nThe ETH price may prolong recovery until the expanding channel is intact.\n\nA falling coin price may find a surge in demand pressure $2430 and $2300 supports\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $11.03 Billion, indicating a 10.3% gain.\n\nThe Ethereum coin has rallied in a bullish trajectory for the past four months, where the price jumped from $1522 to a recent high of $2714, registering 77% growth. A look at the daily time frame chart shows that this recovery can be followed using two divergence trendlines which show the formation of an expanding channel.\n\nThe coin price rebounded at least thrice from both trendlines indicating the market participants took a stick on this pattern structure. In theory, this chart setup reflects increasing volatility in an asset but provides a directional trend, once price breaks from either trendline.\n\nAmid the current downturn in the market, the Ethereum price recently reverted from a $2714 high to a plunge of 7.25% to $2517. This bear within the chart range could tumble the ETH value another 8-9% to lower the trendline around $2300.\n\nSome recent insights from on-chain analytics firm Santiment indicate. In just one week, the Ethereum price dominance over Bitcoin has spiked, reaching a remarkable increase of +22.4%. The network is experiencing rapid growth, averaging 89.4K new $ETH addresses daily, with an impressive surge to 96.3K new wallets yesterday. Ethereum\u2019s presence in exchange supplies is dwindling, dropping from 8.15% to 8.10%, approaching its all-time low of 8.05%.\n\nThese developments project the ETH price is likely to rebound from a lower trendline which could surge its value past $2700 to chase the $3000 mark.\n\nETH/BTC Pair Rebounds From Crucial Support\n\nBased on the latest insights from respected analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, Ethereum is showing a remarkable rebound, potentially signaling an upcoming uptrend. To firmly establish this trend, Ethereum must surpass the 0.06 BTC level. The observation of a weekly bullish divergence is a strong indicator of Ethereum\u2019s increasing momentum, suggesting we might see considerable strength in the market over the next few months.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The ETH price above daily EMAs(100 and 200) accentuates the overall trend is bullish.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): The daily RSI above 50% reflects the buyers having an upper hand on this asset.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "content": "ETH\u2019s value increased above $2,600 despite the 100 ETH sell-off.\n\nDominance over Bitcoin jumped, but it could be better to wait for a pullback.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation let go of another round of Ether [ETH] on the 16th of January, data from Etherscan revealed.\n\nAccording to the details from the transaction, the Foundation changed 100 ETH to stablecoin DAI through its \u201cGrant Provider\u201d address.\n\nThough the purpose of the sale was unknown at press time, previous similar transactions suggest that it was probably a donation to a project.\n\nOver the past year, AMBCrypto revealed how the foundation sold some of its coins. But at different points, the team cleared the air that it was not liquidating its holdings unnecessarily.\n\nTrust in ETH continues to rise\n\nThis time, it does not seem like ETH\u2019s value will plummet because of the action. In fact, on the same day, the value of ETH rose past $2,600 before it later reversed below the level.\n\nHowever, there were solid reasons why we concluded that ETH would not feel the effect of the sell-off. This could be traced to a recent post by on-chain analysis tool Santiment.\n\nAccording to Santiment, 89,400 new addresses were created per day on the Ethereum network in the past week. It also mentioned that a higher number of wallets appeared on the 16th of January.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Ethereum's price dominance continues to surge against #Bitcoin's, now +22.4% in a week. During this stretch, there have been 89.4K new $ETH addresses created per day, and 96.3K wallets just yesterday. Additionally, the 2nd largest market cap asset's supply on (Cont) \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/9nHCl6PJPy \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 16, 2024\n\nThis data implied a surge in network growth, suggesting that ETH\u2019s adoption has been incredible. Should this remain the same way, the chance of ETH\u2019s plunge will remain extremely low.\n\nAlso, the increase in the number of wallets created sparked conviction in the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, it did not end there. AMBCrypto also looked at the supply of the altcoin on exchanges and the supply outside of it. At press time, ETH\u2019s supply outside of exchanges had reached an All-Time High (ATH) of 121.31 million.\n\nConversely, the supply on exchanges got close to an All-Time Low (ATL). At press time, the percentage was 8.08%. These occurrences have helped Ethereum\u2019s dominance over Bitcoin [BTC].\n\nOkay, now could be time to wait for a pullback\n\nIn the past seven days, Ethereum\u2019s market dominance had risen by 22.4% over Bitcoin. If this continues to be the case, then ETH, alongside some altcoins, would outperform BTC.\n\nHowever, an assessment of the Market Value to Realized Value Ratio (MVRV) ratio preached caution.\n\nThe MVRV ratio tells whether a cryptocurrency is trading at a fair value, below it, or is overvalued. Values lower than 1 suggest that the coin is undervalued. But when the MVRV ratio is higher than 1, it suggests closeness to the local top.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAt press time, Glassnode\u2019s data showed that Ethereum\u2019s MVRV ratio was 1.67. This suggested that the market was a little overheated. However, the metric seemed to be falling, which is something that could excite investors.\n\nIf the MVRV ratio drops lower than 1.5, it could be a good entry for those looking to profit from ETH in the long term."

        "content": "Shayan is a digital nomad and a professional journalist. He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nEthereum continues to trade with a bearish consolidation due to Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing failures to break above the $43,000 to $44,000 range since the start of ETF trading. Despite this, Ethereum has shown notable strength compared to Bitcoin following the market correction, with various on-chain metrics signaling positive trends.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strong Dominance Against Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance continues to fall, while Ethereum\u2019s surges, as observed on charts. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has steeply dropped from 55% and it has been declining for the fifth day in a row is commonly seen as a positive sign for altcoins, potentially enabling them to outshine Bitcoin.\n\nThis trend is further evidenced by the recent data, which shows Ethereum\u2019s dominance climbing to a three-month high of over 18.5%. On-chain data provider Santiment reports a significant rise in Ethereum\u2019s price dominance relative to Bitcoin, with an increase of 22.4% in the past week.\n\nThis period also marked a notable increase in Ethereum network engagement, with the creation of around 90K new Ethereum addresses each day, showing the network\u2019s growing appeal. Particularly striking was the creation of a remarkable 96,300 wallets on January 16.\n\nEthereum is also doing a lot of network improvements recently as the newest upgrade to the Ethereum network, codenamed \u201cCancun-Deneb\u201d or \u201cDencun,\u201d went live on the Goerli testnet for the first time yesterday.\n\nUpon its deployment on the mainnet, the Dencun upgrade is expected to substantially reduce transaction costs on Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 solutions like Optimism, Base, Polygon zkEVM, among others, as claimed by developers. Additionally, this upgrade will restrict self-destruct operations and introduce new functionalities for bridges and staking pools.\n\nDue to the active network upgrades, ETH price is holding investors\u2019 confidence and it has impressively outperformed Bitcoin. According to Tradingview, the ETHBTC ratio has also skyrocketed as it now holds momentum at 0.06.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther is currently experiencing a corrective phase within a triangle pattern, with buyers aiming to maintain the ETH price above $2,450. However, bears continue to dominate as they recently plunged the price below $2,500. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,473, declining over 2% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nThe declining 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $2,530 and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) heading toward the selling region suggest that the market momentum is leaning towards the sellers.\n\nA reversal from its present value or a rebound from the $2,400-$2450 zone would indicate a strong inclination for purchasing during dips. Under such circumstances, the ETH/USDT pair could potentially surge to break the pattern at $2,600. Surpassing this threshold might pave the way towards a retest of $2,700 level.\n\nConversely, this bullish scenario could be invalidated in the short term if the price continues its downward trajectory, falling below $2,400. Such a decline could lead the price towards the critical support zone at $2,130-$2,200."

        "content": "A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader doesn\u2019t believe Ethereum (ETH) could lose its top layer-1 (L1) position anytime soon.\n\nThe analyst pseudonymously known as Kaleo tells his 615,900 followers on the social media platform X that the second top-performing digital asset by market cap enjoys a comfortable edge over its multiple competitors.\n\nThe trader believes there\u2019s little chance of ETH losing its top spot in the current crypto market cycle to any L1 project. However, he says the odds of a competitor dethroning ETH could increase after two additional market cycles.\n\n\u201cGonna put this out there: for as much hate as ETH gets, I still don\u2019t expect any L1 to flip it this cycle. Doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t see plenty outgain it. But over the past seven years that I\u2019ve been plugged into this space, I\u2019ve heard countless names called out as the next ETH killer. Ultimately, none of them have unseated Ethereum\u2019s place as the ultimate settlement layer, and I don\u2019t see that changing quite yet. If it were to happen, I think we\u2019re two cycles away from seeing it take place.\u201d\n\nThe trader also updates his outlook on Ethereum and other digital assets, suggesting a possible crypto market cooldown before Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) halving event in April, when miners\u2019 rewards are cut in half.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve started to contemplate this a bit more and think there\u2019s a solid chance we don\u2019t see an ETH run quite yet, and I\u2019m fine with that. I got caught up in the narrative that other L1s were having solid pumps, so ETH had to. In all honesty, we\u2019re probably closer to July of 2019 in the ETH cycle than we are December 2020. We haven\u2019t even had the halving yet, so there\u2019s no need to really jump the gun and get too bullish too fast.\n\nA bit more cool off in the market wouldn\u2019t surprise me, and honestly would be incredibly healthy. It\u2019d give you a chance for incredible entries on alts that you thought you missed over the past several months before the real bull market starts. If somehow we\u2019re still sent endless green candles in the short term, I obviously wouldn\u2019t hate that either, but I\u2019m prepared to be patient.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,481 at time of writing, down nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

ETH trimmed gains and might struggle to stay above the $2,500 support zone.\n\nEthereum attempted a fresh increase but failed to surpass $2,620.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,540 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair start another increase if the bulls protect the $2,500 and $2,470 support levels.\n\nEthereum Price Revisits Support\n\nEthereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,520 resistance zone. ETH even climbed above the $2,550 level, but the bears were active near $2,600, like Bitcoin.\n\nThe price traded as high as $2,614 and recently started a fresh decline. There was a move below the $2,550 support zone. The price traded below the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,471 swing low to the $2,614 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The bulls seem to be currently active above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,471 swing low to the $2,614 high.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,540 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $2,540 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next major resistance is now near $2,580. A clear move above the $2,580 level might start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,620 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key hurdle sits near the $2,650 zone. A close above the $2,650 resistance could start another steady increase. The next key resistance is near $2,720. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,800 zone.\n\nDownside Break in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,540 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,500 level.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,470 zone. A downside break below the $2,470 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,400 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,500\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,540\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "What you'll learn The number of blockchain developers fell 24% last year.\n\nNewcomer devs accounted for a greater proportion of the exit from the blockchain developer community.\n\nBlockchain developer talent is becoming more evenly spread across the globe.\n\nA new report by web3-focused venture firm Electric Capital found a significant drop in the number of monthly active developers in the last year, with a nearly 25% decrease to 22,411 compared to 2022.\n\nDeveloper activity is often seen as a measure of value creation in the crypto space. Despite challenges like bear market conditions and the allure of the emerging AI sector, most experienced developers \u2014 those with at least a year under their belt \u00ad\u2014 remain committed to blockchain development.\n\nBut for the least experienced developers \u2014 those who have been working in crypto for less than a year \u2014 the scenario is quite different.\n\nBlockchain developer count declined last year (Electric Capital)\n\nThe report points out that the high turnover among the least experienced developers in the crypto sector is linked to the bear market\u2019s impact.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nElectric Capital\u2019s cohort retention analysis shows shows that those developers who start their careers during a bear market are more likely to leave sooner than their counterparts who join in more stable market conditions.\n\nExperienced developers grew 16%, according to the report. This growth trend is in keeping with the steady increase in established developers who choose to remain in the industry as seen over the last five years Indeed, growth figures for the most tenured blockchain developers is up over 52% in the last five years.\n\n\u201cExperienced devs push more code: 75% of code is created by developers in crypto 1+ years,\u201d the report said.\n\nEVM chains hold sway\n\nWhile multichain development has increased 10-fold since 2015, much of that activity is concentrated in Ethereum and other blockchains that run on the so-called Ethereum Virtual Machine. That includes blockchains like Avalanche, Fantom, and Polygon.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nEVM networks are similar to Ethereum and they use the same smart contract logic. That makes developers on Ethereum more likely to migrate to other EVM blockchains and vice versa. EVM blockchains account for 87% of multichain developer activity, as per the report.\n\nEthereum layer 2 blockchains \u2014 Ethereum scaling networks that rely on the mainnet for security \u2014 saw the most crossover among developers from across all EVM networks. Developers working on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum, Starknet, and Optimism saw the greatest level of crossover in this regard.\n\nDev report 1 The majority of EVM smart contract code is first deployed on Ethereum (Electric Capital)\n\nBNB Chain and Polygon also drew from the crowd of multichain developers with roots in Ethereum. At least a third of Ethereum multichain developers deployed code on Polygon and BNB Chain.\n\n\u201c71% of contract code is initially deployed on Ethereum.\u201d \u2014 Electric Capital Blockchain Developer Report 2023\n\nEthereum the most unique\n\nEthereum stands out as the dominant player among EVM blockchains, boasting 7,864 monthly active developers, although this represents a 25% decline from the previous year.\n\nThe report highlights that the smart contract codes deployed on Ethereum last year were predominantly unique, with most not being deployed on any other EVM platforms.\n\nMoreover, 71% of EVM contracts are initially launched on Ethereum, reinforcing its role as the leading source of new on-chain logic for other networks.\n\nWhat about Bitcoin?\n\nMost blockchain development happens on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the top 200 crypto projects by market capitalisation, with Bitcoin and Ethereum accounting for 40%, according to the report.\n\nNOW READ: Degens are so high on inscriptions they just poured $106m into a Bitcoin NFT game that hasn\u2019t even been created\n\nBitcoin has seen a notable decrease in its developer activity, with 1,071 monthly active developers currently, marking a 19% reduction from the previous year\u2019s figures.\n\nThis decline is primarily attributed to the departure of part-time Bitcoin developers and those who are involved in multiple blockchain projects.\n\nBut the report also found that developers dedicated exclusively to Bitcoin were more likely to remain engaged in the platform.\n\nWhile Ordinals caused a transaction spike on Bitcoin, it did not translate to significant developer interest, attracting only 3% of devs with most of their colleagues focused on Bitcoin layer 2 networks and other scaling networks.\n\nThe US loses more ground\n\nAs crypto adoption spreads across the globe, so also is the distribution of blockchain development talent across the globe.\n\n\u201c74% of crypto developers live outside of the US.\u201d \u2014 Electric Capital Developer Report 2023\n\nSeven out of every 10 blockchain developers are outside North America and the United States has lost 14% of its share of the global blockchain dev market since 2018, the report said. The US now only accounts for 26% of blockchain developers compared to 40% in 2018.\n\nGlobal blockchain developer distribution continues to be more diverse with each passing year (Electric Capital)\n\nEurope and Central Asia are now the major global hub for blockchain development with 36% of devs from this report, per the report.\n\nWith more blockchain developers outside North America, the distribution of talent has undergone a meaningful shift.

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin vs Ethereum ETFs: The Race Is On - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "ETF Investing Tools\n\nThe bitcoin versus Ethereum ETF race is on for 2024.\n\nA 24% performance differential divides the popular crypto investments, as futures-based Ethereum ETFs are up nearly 15% and the new spot bitcoin ETFs are down 9% in their first three days of trading through Jan. 16.\n\nOver that brief period, $1.2 billion has flowed from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), while $740 million has flowed into new spot ETFs like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), meaning that almost $2billion has gone into the non-GBTC spot bitcoin ETFs this year. The heavy flows and trading volume partially explain the negative performance for spot bitcoin ETFs thus far.\n\nInvestors Eye SEC Approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum appears to be gaining a similar kind of investor enthusiasm as Bitcoin did in 2023, as multiple issuers, including the ETF behemoth BlackRock, Inc., have filed for a spot Ethereum ETF. The timetable for the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a spot Ethereum ETF takes us to May 2024, which could lead to the bidding up of Ethereum prices in the coming months.\n\nAlthough the 2024 spot bitcoin versus Ethereum ETF race has only just begun, the story is setting up as the more established cryptocurrency versus the rising outsider.\n\nGBTC Outflows Impact Spot Bitcoin ETF Pricing\n\nDigging a bit deeper into spot bitcoin\u2019s poor start, $1.2 billion flowing out of GBTC pumped significant liquidity into the bitcoin ecosystem. The higher supply offset the early demand; thus, the price did not leap higher as many expected. The SEC announcement also appeared to become a \u201csell the news\u201d event.\n\nBTC\u2019s price rose more than 21% from late November through Jan. 8, peaking near $47,000 according to crypto data aggregator CoinGecko data, as signs suggested increasingly that the SEC would approve at least a few of the filings (the agency approved all 11 applications). A primary reason for GBTC\u2019s huge outflows is likely its expense ratio of 1.50%, which is more than 100 basis points higher than any of the other 10 spot bitcoin ETFs on the market. Another reason is that GBTC had previously been a closed-end bitcoin trust with $29 billion in assets, and the SEC allowed it to convert to a spot bitcoin ETF last week as the new spot ETFs launched.\n\nStory continues\n\nGBTC\u2019s conversion enabled investors to sell shares. They had likely been waiting to exit the closed-end fund once they were longer locked in. Many investors bought GBTC at a discount in 2023, which was as low as 50%. and sold at par to capture gains after the conversion.\n\nClosed-end funds can be less liquid than ETFs, which are open-ended funds. The limited number of shares outstanding can result in wider bid-ask spreads and reduced liquidity for CEFs. If there aren't enough buyers, a closed-end fund can trade at a discount.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for the Spot Bitcoin vs Ethereum ETF Race?\n\nInvestors will likely be eyeing the bitcoin halving in April. The halving will cut the reward for bitcoin miners from the current 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin, reducing the number of tokens entering the system. Observers of the digital asset space widely expect the event to boost BTC\u2019s price and bring more assets into spot bitcoin funds.\n\nBitcoin miners are lynchpins of the blockchain, helping to ensure its integrity. A month later, the SEC will decide on multiple applications for Ethereum ETFs, which could increase the price of ether, the token of the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "content": "Investors are likely to have a relook at ether as the spot ETF narrative gathers steam and Ethereum remains the dominant chain in the DeFi and NFT world, according to analysts.\n\nEther is qualified to be a core holding in a diversified crypto portfolio, one observer said.\n\nEther [ETH], the native token of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, underperformed bitcoin [BTC] in 2023, as the latter\u2019s new-found smart contract, non-fungible tokens (NFT) narrative, and spot ETF optimism drew investor money.\n\nPer analysts, investors will likely have a relook at ether this year as Ethereum is still the world\u2019s leading smart contract blockchain with key upgrades lined up, and ether is widely seen as the next likely candidate to get a spot-based ETF in the U.S.\n\n\u201cETH could be poised for a breakout year,\u201d Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase said in the weekly newsletter. \u201cLast week\u2019s bitcoin ETF news proved to be a boon for ethereum, which briefly spiked above $2,700 \u2014 reaching its highest price since May 2022. And there are reasons to be even more optimistic about ETH\u2019s near-term future. For one, several of the firms behind the BTC ETFs \u2014 including BlackRock and VanEck \u2014 are also plotting ether-based spot ETFs.\u201d\n\nA spot ETF invests in actual cryptocurrency, allowing investors to take exposure to the asset without having to own it, and is considered a better option than futures-based ETFs, which are vulnerable to roll costs. So, just as spot BTC ETFs, a potential launch of spot ETH ETFs is expected to open floodgates to institutional and retail money.\n\nNearly a dozen bitcoin spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. last Thursday and have registered a cumulative volume of over $10 billion, with BlackRock\u2019s product amassing $1 billion in inflows.\n\nDencun upgrade and institutional demand\n\nIn addition, Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Dencun upgrade, which aims to improve the mainnet\u2019s scalability by introducing \u201cdata blobs,\u201d could galvanize investor interest in the cryptocurrency, according to Coinbase. The upgrade went live on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet early this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nA blob is a temporary transaction data memory typically related to Layer 2 solutions that can be attached to Ethereum. Following the upgrade to the mainnet, the network will only need to confirm the correctness of the blob data attached to the block rather than verify each transaction, helping reduce congestion and network fees.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade began initial tests on Wednesday and in coming months is expected to implement EIP-4844 (\u201cEIP\u201d stands for \u201cEthereum improvement proposal\u201d), which some ETH watchers predict could help reduce network fees by 90% or more,\u201d Coinbase noted.\n\nInstitutional crypto firm ETC Group, in its annual report, discussed a bullish outlook for the ether-bitcoin ratio and explained that despite 2023's inscriptions-led boom in Bitcoin's network activity, Ethereum remains the dominant chain for building decentralized applications, NFTs, and tokenized assets.\n\nFor instance, data tracked by ETC Group show, the top 10 ERC-20 tokens have a cumulative market value of $21 billion \u2013 or 13 times bigger than the $1.6 billion market capitalization of the entire BRC-20 token universe of over 37,000 coins. ERC-20 is Ethereum\u2019s token standard, while BRC-20 is a fungible digital asset created on the Bitcoin network.\n\nFurther, ether investors can generate extra returns on top of their holdings by staking or locking their coins in the network in return for rewards. The current annualized reward rate is around 3.84%, having averaged about 4% to 5% since Ethereum completed the Merge in September 2022.\n\nLastly, Ethereum's feature of burning a portion of transaction fees paid in ETH has a deflationary effect on the token's supply, positively affecting investors.\n\n\"The strong dominance of Ethereum in terms of smart contract platforms and the possibility to earn an additional source of yield imply that it should also be a core holding in a diversified cryptoasset portfolio as well,\" ETC Group said. \"We therefore think that it is quite likely for the relative performance of ETH/BTC to reverse itself in 2024. In fact, ETH/BTC\u2019s 12-month relative performance has historically shown a strong tendency to mean revert,\" ETC Group added.\n\nEther has outperformed bitcoin so far this year, with the ether-bitcoin ratio (ETH/BTC) trading 10% higher. The ratio tanked over 25% last year.\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Ethereum Remains Very Bullish Inside Rising Price Channel, and Traders Are Buying These ERC-20 Tokens to Profit - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin might be down 9% this week, but Ethereum continues to remain very bullish as it trades inside a rising price channel.\n\nThe number two ranked cryptocurrency is now up by a strong 10% this week, while the majority of the top-10 other tokens take a nosedive.\n\nThe narrative behind an incoming $ETH ETF next is primarily driving markets higher.\n\nWith Ethereum on the move, traders are turning their attention back to ERC-20 tokens in the hopes of profiting from the ecosystem\u2019s bullish sentiment.\n\nEthereum Remains Bullish Inside Rising Price Channel as Traders Predict $3,000 $ETH Next.\n\nEthereum is up by a strong 10% this week as it currently trades above $2,530.\n\nThe cryptocurrency remains bullish as it trades inside a rising price channel, with traders predicting a break toward the upside will result in a run toward the $3,000 level.\n\nEthereum also saw a sudden surge in volume, which is helping it outpace Bitcoin this week.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has pulled back from last week\u2019s highs after failing to break the combined resistance provided by the upper angle of the range and a 1.272 Fib Extension at $2,640.\n\nLooking ahead, the first level of resistance lies at $2,640. If the buyers can continue to break above the upper angle of the price channel, then resistance is expected at $2,770 (1.414 Fib Extension) and $2,800.\n\nIf the bulls can clear higher resistance at $2,950 (1.618 Fib Extension), they will be free to attempt $3,000.\n\nWhat ERC-20 Tokens Are Traders Buying for Profit?\n\nWhile Ethereum started to see a surprising move upward, traders are now turning their focus back to ERC-20 tokens, believing they can provide significant profits.\n\nIn particular, $SPONGE is turning heads as it attracts over $4 million into its staking contract for its V2 upgrade, slated to bring the first 100x meme coin return in 2024.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin Minetrix ($BTCMTX) also gains momentum after crossing the $8.5 million fundraising milestone.\n\n$SPONGE Sees an Incredible $4 Million in Staked Assets As Traders Ready Themselves For V2 100x Return\n\nSpongebob Token ($SPONGE) has now seen the total amount of $SPONGE staked in its V2 contract rise past the $4 million level, demonstrating the building hype behind its v2 upgrade.\n\n$SPONGE was one of the hottest trending meme coins in 2023 after providing a 100x return following its fair launch in May 2023.\n\nThe cryptocurrency managed to amass a combined social following of 30,000 people as top exchanges like Gate.io and MEXC rushed to list the token.\n\nThe project is back with its V2 incarnation, aiming to reproduce the 100x return in 2024.\n\nThe exciting thing is that $SPONGE isn\u2019t hosting a typical presale. Instead, it\u2019s utilizing a stake-to-bridge, which requires $SPONGE holders to staker their V1 tokens to be allocated an equivalent amount of the V2 upgrade.\n\nThe stake-to-bridge utility is the only way to get positioned in V2. If you don\u2019t own $SPONGE V1, you can purchase it through the project\u2019s website and have it automatically staked for the V2 upgrade.\n\nAll $SPONGE V1 locked in the smart contract will be permanently locked to facilitate the transition to the V2 token.\n\nThe project has been audited by SolidProof, bringing security to investors.\n\nOverall, $SPONGE has already shown its capabilities in 2023 with a 100x surge and is back to repeat its success in 2024.Buy and Stake $SPONGE Today\n\n$BTCMTX Raises An Enormous $8.5 Million In Stake-to-Mine Presale\n\nBitcoin MInetrix ($BTCMTX) is another token turning heads as the presale crosses the $8.5 million milestone.\n\nThe significant backing clearly demonstrates that investors are touting Bitcoin Minetrix as a disruptive force in the cloud mining sector ahead of the next Bitcoin block halving.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix intends to make it easier for everyday users to mine Bitcoin without trusting centralized entities.\n\nThe project introduces a novel stake-to-mine concept that lets users buy and stake $BTCMTX tokens to start cloud mining Bitcoin.\n\nParticipants are doubling their passive income, with one source coming from mining returns and another from staking rewards.\n\nThose currently staking are earning an impressive 76% APY on their holdings.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix essentially tokenizes the cloud mining sector, putting the control back into the hands of the miners, who won\u2019t have to worry about being short-changed on potential earnings or being locked into long-term contracts.\n\nThose interested in the token can purchase it during the presale for $0.0128.\n\nBuy $BTCMTX Today.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe Ethereum Classic price has lost approximately 5% in valuation within the past 24 hours, making it one of the top losers in the crypto industry for the day. Further, the market displays a constant bearish movement, suggesting a strong bear power.\n\nThe Ethereum Classic price traded in a closed range between $20.32 and $21.94 for a period, following which the bulls gained momentum and the price broke out of the range. However, the rally was short-lived as the price faced rejection at $23.45.\n\nTradingView: ETC/USDT\n\nAfter this, the price traded between $21.94 and $23.45 for about a week. As the bears overpowered the bulls, the ETC price recorded a correction of approximately 15% in valuation.\n\nFollowing this, the price traded in a consolidated range between $18.77 and $21.94 for a brief period. The bulls regained momentum, resulting in the Ethereum Classic price jumping over 42% in valuation within a day.\n\nAfter facing rejection at $31.23, the price has been constantly trading under a descending channel pattern, indicating a strong bearish influence in the market.\n\nWill ETC Price Regain Value?\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) displays a neutral trend, suggesting weak buying and selling pressure in the market. Further, the averages show a constant decline, suggesting an uncertainty in the future price action of the coin.\n\nIf the market regains value, the ETC price will test its resistance level of $29 soon. Maintaining the price at that level will set the stage for the Ethereum Classic price to attempt to test its upper resistance level of $31.23 in the coming days.\n\nConversely, if the bears overpowered the bulls, the price would lose momentum and fall to test its support level of $25.04. Moreover, if the bears continue to dominate the market, it will plunge and prepare to test its lower support level of $23.45."

This fee is deducted when rewards are collected. Rewards displayed for each validator are always post-fee.\n\nStaking Rewards\n\nRewards for Ethereum validators consist of a consistent base rate, supplemented by variable rewards received when a validator is randomly chosen to participate in block validation. The current reward rate for staking is at 4.26%, according to stakingrewards.com.\n\nConsenSys Staking, the entity behind MetaMask Staking, boasts no slashing penalties incurred in over two years of operation and managing over $2 billion in ETH across more than 33,000 validators, according to MetaMask's website.\n\nSlashing happens where validators lose a portion of their 32 ETH stake as a penalty for misbehavior, such as improper block attestation or inactivity.\n\nThe wallet had introduced staking via its Portfolio app in August."

        "title": "Arbitrum Commands Nearly Half of Total Market Share in Ethereum Rollups: Nansen - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Arbitrum has \u201crobust fundamentals,\u201d according to a Nansen analyst, but investors are concerned about its upcoming $2 billion token unlock.\n\nArbitrum, the leading scaling solution for Ethereum, has captured roughly half of the entire rollup market share, according to blockchain analytics firm Nansen in a research report published Thursday.\n\nRollups are designed to help users transact faster and more inexpensively on the Ethereum network by moving computation off-chain and batching a collection of transactions before posting them to Ethereum\u2019s base layer.\n\nWith $11.47 billion in locked value in its smart contracts, Arbitrum has captured about 48% of the entire rollup market share.\n\nArbitrum has \u201crobust fundamentals,\u201d Nansen research analyst Sandra Leow said in the research report. Notably, growth in daily transactions and monthly revenue has been impressive. Despite Ethereum surpassing it in daily transactions, Arbitrum averages 600,000 to 900,000 transactions per day, outpacing its rollup rival, Optimism, the second largest rollup with over $5.5 billion in locked value, per L2Beat.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s revenue trajectory has been consistently upward since Sept. 2023, Leow noted. Last month, Arbitrum generated revenue of $11.9 million, its highest monthly earnings to date.\n\nConcerns About Upcoming Token Unlock\n\nThe outlook is not all sunny for Arbitrum, however. Some crypto investors see risks in Arbitrum due to its upcoming token unlocks which will free up a massive amount of ARB.\n\nToken unlocks refer to the release of frozen or locked cryptocurrencies. Ideally, token unlocks are gradual to prevent large-scale sell-offs by early investors. But Arbitrum is about to have a \u201cheavy unlock,\u201d explained Charles Storry, co-founder of crypto index platform Phuture, to Unchained on Telegram.\n\nRight now, Arbitrum has a very small circulating supply of 1.275 billion ARB, only 12.75% of its total token supply. However, in about two months, 1.11 billion ARB \u2014 87% of its circulating supply \u2014 will be unlocked.\n\nAfter the March unlock, which is valued at over $2 billion, Arbitrum will begin monthly unlocks for the next three years, according to its governance documents.\n\nPositive Catalysts\n\nSeveral catalysts may increase positive sentiment among the Arbitrum community, however, according to Nansen\u2019s Leow. The first is a recently passed proposal about the implementation of a staking mechanism, which would let token holders lock their ARB in exchange for rewards.\n\nThe second is Arbitrum\u2019s short-term incentive program (STIP), which allows protocols such as GMX and Camelot to apply and receive grants as a means to boost on-chain activity.\n\nThe third is EIP-4844, which \u201cis a big step forward in Ethereum\u2019s Rollup-centric roadmap,\u201d because it reduces the cost of rollups by 10-20x, wrote Leow. While investors have expressed bearish remarks about ARB\u2019s price, \u201cgenerally people are more closely monitoring EIP-4844 (blobs) in the Ethereum Dencun upgrade,\u201d Carlos Mercado, a data scientist at blockchain analytics firm Flipside Crypto, said to Unchained over Telegram.\n\nRead More: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun Upgrade Live on Testnet After Bug Delays Finalization\n\nThe last catalyst revolves around Arbitrum Orbit, which allows developers to create new chains atop Arbitrum\u2019s layer 2 rollup. According to Leow, the main benefit of Arbitrum Orbit is that it allows the use of tokens native to the chains atop Arbitrum as compensation for gas, which would \u201climit sell pressure of the said token.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite investor concerns over imminent token unlocks and the ARB token\u2019s underperformance, ARB is strategically positioned as a frontrunner in the optimistic rollup sector, commanding nearly half of the total market share in rollups,\u201d Leow said.\n\nARB, the governance token for Arbitrum, is currently trading at $1.91, down roughly 14% in the past seven days, data from Coingecko shows.\n\nDisclosure: Arbitrum is a sponsor for Unchained."

        "title": "Ethereum Proto-Danksharking Successfully Live on Goerli Testnet - Blockonomi",
        "content": "The Dencun upgrade, one of the major upgrades in the Ethereum blockchain, went live on January 17, successfully integrating proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) to the Goerli tesnet. This testnet deployment will set the stage for the next upgrades on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets and the final launch on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nDespite encountering hurdles, the Dencun upgrade has successfully deployed on the Goerli testnet.\n\nParitosh Jayanthi, a DevOps engineer at Ethereum Foundation, confirmed the implementation in an X post: \u201cGoerli forked and blobs are now enabled on the testnet!\u201d He also monitored a live stream that showcased the upgrade.\n\nAs the implementation took place, it hit unexpected roadblocks, including a potential \u201cchain-split\u201d as there were issues with syncing between clients. Jayanthi noted that the Goerli fork failed to reach consensus and finality due to the low participation of Prysm validators, reportedly 80% being online at launch.\n\nEthereum Evolves\n\nTerence, a maintainer of Prysm, an Ethereum consensus layer client, said that this issue could be attributed to the lack of software upgrades and a software bug.\n\nTo wit, \u201cThe participation is low (~80%). Losing finality requires approximately 10% of validators to be offline. Being offline could be due to operators not upgrading a piece of software (and there are multiple)\u2026or a software bug.\u201d\n\nHowever, Jayanthi said within a few hours that the issue was fixed and validators were back online, successfully reaching finality.\n\nOne thing to note is that the Goreli testnet will stop running within one to three months after the Dencun upgrade is successfully implemented. Following this decision, the Ethereum Foundation acknowledged that this would moderately affect the network\u2019s stability.\n\nStill, it would be a good opportunity for them to check the delays and security when many validators get reduced, similar to how they got rid of Ropsten and Rinkerby as Ethereum continuously achieved important progress.\n\nLower Transaction Costs Coming Soon?\n\nDencun is one of the major upgrades of the Ethereum network, following the Merge and Shanghai. The upgrade is expected to introduce a number of improvements to Ethereum, such as reducing the cost of storing transaction data and storage demand, improving the cross-chain design, and changing the blocks\u2019 data structure, among others.\n\nDencun also aims to significantly reduce transaction costs for Optimism Rollups like Arbitrum or Optimism, attracting more users and enhancing Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nBefore its finalization on Goreli, the development team had initially implemented Dencun on multiple testnets to check for possible problems. If Dencun operates smoothly without major bugs in all these testnet environments, the activation on the mainnet will be planned and scheduled within Q1/2024.\n\nWith the successful implementation, all eyes are set on Ethereum\u2019s price movement during the year\u2019s first quarter. Layer 2 protocols will also be in the spotlight since the Dencun upgrade is expected to bring major benefits to these protocols.\n\nAt the press time, Ethereum is trading at around $2,500, down 2.35% in the last 24 hours. The decline followed a report of the Ethereum Foundation engaging in the sale of ETH through over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges. Notably, the team conducted a transfer of 100 ETH (equivalent to $253,000) to address 0xd77, receiving 253,000 DAI in return.\n\nWhile ETH is a leading token, it will have to fight with other blockchains going forward. SOL, for example, is getting attention, and this could make it a real threat to ETH in the coming years.\n\nThroughout 2023, the organization reportedly liquidated 2,262 ETH at an average price of $1,609 per ETH. These divestitures are often observed preceding market declines, drawing attention within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nDespite these sales, the Ethereum Foundation maintains a substantial ETH portfolio. On-chain data indicates total ETH assets amounting to $886 million, comprising $806 million in ETH and $79.81 million in WETH. Additionally, they possess around $500,000 in stablecoins and $15,000 in Binance Coin (BNB)."

        "content": "Santiment\u2019s on-chain data recently signaled a notable bullish momentum for XRP (XRP). Meanwhile, Ethereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) rollercoaster performance in Q4 2023 and its upcoming Spiral Hard Fork adds complexity to the crypto landscape.\n\nYet, NuggetRush (NUGX) emerges as a standout altcoin, blending cryptocurrency, physical mining, and gold mining into a P2E NFT gaming platform.\n\n>>Visist NuggetRush Presale<<\n\nXRP (XRP) Bulls to Gain Momentum? Santiment On-Chain Data Signals Optimism\n\nOn January 14, 2024, Santiment on-chain data showed a significant bullish bias toward XRP (XRP). Bitcoin (BTC) had its historic moment in the past week after the SEC approved its exchange-traded funds that have been pending for many years.\n\nOn that note, sentiment toward large-cap assets remained optimistic, with a focus on them after the ETF approvals. On that note, traders have discussed the possibility of XRP ETF approvals.\n\nSantiment highlighted that XRP sentiment and discussion rates have surged to the highest levels since May 2023. That was when XRP social discussions increased weeks before the July 11 ruling, which stipulated that XRP was not a security.\n\nSeveral notable figures in the crypto space have speculated about the altcoin\u2019s possibility of having an ETF approved. Investors might be more ready to buy XRP due to fear of missing out, but so far, this doesn\u2019t seem to have pushed the prices higher.\n\nAt the time of this writing, XRP is trading at a 5% loss for the past 7 days.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s (ETC) Rollercoaster Q4 2023 Performance, Anticipation and Concerns Surrounding Spiral Hard Fork\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) performed well in Q4 2023, surging from $16.36 to $22.69 in December, a 36.19% increase. Nonetheless, Ethereum Classic (ETC) dropped to where it currently trades at around $25 on January 18th.\n\nThe Spiral Hard Fork, expected to go live on January 31, 2024, increases considerations for this market\u2019s participants. This upgrade aims to enhance compatibility and guarantee technical improvements for Ethereum Classic (ETC). However, experiences with hard forks in crypto have caused market uncertainties.\n\nInvestors and traders will approach ETC cautiously since the Ethereum Classic transition needs participants, including those in crypto mining and exchanges, to update software to adopt these changes. Future market sentiment around Ethereum Classic (ETC) might be influenced by possible challenges or uncertainties linked to the upgrade.\n\nBut, after the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum Classic (ETC) awakened. Ethereum Classic (ETC) was trading at $27.03 on January 14, up 36.93% in that week. It has since retraced slightly, as mentioned above.\n\nUnlocking Adventure: NuggetRush (NUGX) Dominates Blockchain Gaming with Innovative P2E and NFT Integration\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) blends cryptocurrency, physical world artisanal mining, and gold mining into a play-to-earn (P2E) NFT gaming platform. The integration of these elements rewards NuggetRush (NUGX) players with valuable in-game items and creates a thrilling gaming experience.\n\nSince it is a community-driven blockchain game, NuggetRush (NUGX) attempts to enable users to generate passive wealth. The game sets up a mining network and challenges players to operate successful mining businesses as they enjoy rewards.\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) lets players start with a small amount of land and simple equipment. They must navigate the digital space, looking for collectibles offered as financial rewards.\n\nBesides earning potential, NuggetRush (NUGX) enables players to experience an enjoyable and realistic gaming adventure. It blends physical mining experience with strategic land discovery, thinking, and the fun of collaborating on mining tasks with the other players.\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) players earn by trading in-game collectibles like character NFTs and RUSHGEMs on its marketplace. Notably, NuggetRush has recorded massive success, selling over 155 million NUGX tokens and raising more than $1.8 million.\n\nCurrently, NuggetRush (NUGX) has almost completed round 4 of its presale, valued at $0.015. Round 5 is coming up, and the token will surge to $0.018, assuming the round is successful.\n\nVisit NuggetRush Presale Website\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "Ethereum's Layer 2 Debate: Buterin Aligns with Daniel Wang on Validium Classification - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin agrees with Daniel Wang on classifying Ethereum rollups using external data chains as validiums, not traditional rollups. This debate underscores the nuances in Ethereum's layer-2 scaling solutions, focusing on security and scalability trade-offs.\n\nEthereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin , has sparked a significant discussion in the crypto community regarding the classification and nature of layer 2 scaling solutions, especially focusing on the concept of validiums. This debate arises following Buterin's agreement with a statement by Daniel Wang, the founder of the Ethereum rollup solution Taiko, on the classification of certain layer-2 solutions as validiums.\n\nButerin concurred with Wang's view that Ethereum rollups utilizing external data chains, such as the modular blockchain Celestia, should be considered validiums rather than traditional rollups. The crux of this classification lies in the security guarantees provided by these solutions. Buterin emphasized that the essence of a rollup is its unconditional security guarantee, which allows users to recover their assets even in cases of collusion. This level of security is compromised when data availability relies on external systems, a characteristic of validium networks.\n\nValidiums, a subset of Ethereum scaling solutions, use zero-knowledge proofs to facilitate off-chain transactions while depending on Ethereum's mainnet for security and verification. Unlike zero-knowledge rollups that batch transactions on a layer-2 network and then verify them on Ethereum's main chain, validiums do not post full transaction data to the main chain. Instead, they post cryptographic proofs of the transactions' validity, aiming for greater scalability since the complete transaction data isn't stored on-chain. However, this approach has its drawbacks, notably in terms of data availability, as it depends on operators to post honest proofs.\n\nThe debate around validiums and their classification as layer-2 solutions is not just technical but also conceptual. It reflects the evolving nature of Ethereum's infrastructure and the diverse perspectives within its community. Buterin, in response to the debate, suggested new terminologies, proposing terms like \"strong\" for security-favoring systems and \"light\" for scale-favoring systems, such as validiums. This proposal is part of a broader conversation about the trade-offs between security, decentralization, and scalability in the development of Ethereum's layer-2 solutions.\n\nDespite the ongoing debates, the adoption of layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism is increasing, indicating a growing interest and investment in Ethereum's scaling solutions. The upcoming Ethereum Merge upgrade is anticipated to further boost the efficiency and appeal of these networks.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum's journey mirrors the early days of the internet, evolving from a niche technology to a mainstream platform. As Ethereum undergoes significant technical transitions, including the layer-2 scaling transition, it faces challenges similar to those the internet overcame. This evolution, marked by debates like the one sparked by Buterin, is a testament to Ethereum's dynamic and innovative community, striving to balance scalability, security, and decentralization.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "We\u2019ve analyzed multiple Ethereum mining apps for Android to help you understand why using them probably isn\u2019t the best idea and why any app claiming to offer \u201cEthereum mining\u201d is misleading.\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t want to leave you empty handed, so we\u2019ll also be featuring 5 Ethereum apps for Android that will enable you to earn ETH passively through staking.\n\nAre Ethereum mining apps for Android legit?\n\nThe short answer is no. The Ethereum cryptocurrency is secured through staking, and not mining. This has been the case since September of 2022, when an upgrade called The Merge removed the network\u2019s old Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism and introduced a new Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.\n\nEven if Ethereum still used mining, no mobile phone on the market today would be powerful enough to mine it profitably.\n\nTherefore, any app that claims to provide Ethereum mining services is misleading at best and an outright scam at worst.\n\nWe were able to find 5 apps on the Google Play store that claim to be providing Ethereum mining or Ethereum cloud mining services. While the majority of these apps have a solid rating of 4 stars or more on the surface, a closer look at the reviews makes it obvious that the majority of 5-star reviews are not genuine. Meanwhile, there are a lot of genuine reviews with a 1-star rating that suggest the apps are not actually mining Ethereum. In some cases, the apps are even trying to convince users to buy another product.\n\nFor example, there are a lot of complaints from users saying that the app requires them to purchase a particular cryptocurrency wallet app before they can withdraw the ETH rewards they have supposedly earned.\n\nIf someone is asking you to pay to use a cryptocurrency wallet, that is a major red flag \u2014 legitimate cryptocurrency wallets, even those offering the most advanced features, can be downloaded for free. In fact, we haven\u2019t been able to find a single legitimate cryptocurrency wallet that is not completely free to use (apart from the fees blockchain networks charge for transactions).\n\nBest Android apps for earning Ethereum rewards\n\nThe bottom line is that you should avoid all apps that claim to be offering Ethereum mining. However, there are apps that will allow you to earn ETH passively, by giving you access to Ethereum staking. Please keep in mind that you\u2019ll need to already own some ETH if you want to earn additional ETH through staking.\n\nBinance - The world's top crypto exchange has an Ethereum staking feature\n\n- The world's top crypto exchange has an Ethereum staking feature Kraken - A rock-solid crypto exchange that allows users to earn ETH staking rewards\n\n- A rock-solid crypto exchange that allows users to earn ETH staking rewards Coinbase - Beginner-friendly crypto exchange with Ethereum staking feature\n\n- Beginner-friendly crypto exchange with Ethereum staking feature MetaMask - The best Ethereum wallet overall\n\n- The best Ethereum wallet overall Trust Wallet - A versatile crypto wallet that you can use to stake ETH and earn rewards\n\n1. Binance - The world's top crypto exchange has an Ethereum staking feature\n\nBinance is a leading cryptocurrency exchange that lists hundreds of different crypto assets and provides a diverse suite of services for crypto investors. This also includes Ethereum staking \u2014 if you have ETH, you can stake it on Binance to passively earn rewards.\n\nIf you stake ETH through Binance, you will receive WBETH tokens, which represent your staked ETH. The conversion rate between WBETH and ETH gradually increases in favor of WBETH through the time to reflect the rewards earned by the ETH Binance is staking on behalf of its users.\n\nIf you wish to get your ETH back, you can simply redeem your WBETH tokens and receive ETH in return. The amount of ETH you can earn this way is determined by the size of your stake (bigger is better) and the duration of your stake (longer is better).\n\nEarn ETH on Binance\n\n2. Kraken Pro - A rock-solid crypto exchange that allows users to earn ETH staking rewards\n\nKraken is a cryptocurrency exchange that has been operating for more than a decade and has built a strong reputation for keeping its users\u2019 fund safe even though many other exchanges have lost their customers\u2019 fund to hacks.\n\nIf you have ETH, you can stake it via the Kraken Pro app to benefit from staking rewards. Unlike Binance, which uses a token to represent staked ETH, the process on Kraken is more straightforward as there is no such token involved. However, the downside of Kraken\u2019s approach is that users can\u2019t get any liquidity from their staked ETH unless they unstake their coins.\n\nEarn ETH on Kraken\n\n3. Coinbase - Beginner-friendly crypto exchange with Ethereum staking feature\n\nCoinbase is a reputable crypto exchange that\u2019s known as one of the best crypto platforms for beginners. Coinbase provides an Ethereum staking service which allows ETH holders to earn additional rewards on their coins passively.\n\nUsers on Coinbase have the option to wrap their staked ETH coins and receive cbETH tokens. These tokens can be redeemed (or \u201cunwrapped\u201d) for ETH, but can be useful to still access the liquidity associated with your staked ETH.\n\nIf you\u2019re a long-term ETH holder that wants to put your idle coins to work, staking through Coinbase is certainly an option worth considering.\n\nEarn ETH on Coinbase\n\n4. MetaMask - The best Ethereum wallet overall\n\nThe previous ETH staking options we\u2019ve covered in this article are all facilitated through centralized cryptocurrency exchanges which stake users\u2019 ETH on their behalf. Now, let\u2019s take a look at some options to stake Ethereum in a more decentralized manner using on-chain liquid staking protocols.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with MetaMask, an extremely popular Ethereum wallet that also offers an Android app version. MetaMask offers a convenient staking option within the MetaMask portfolio feature that allows users to easily stake their ETH through liquid staking protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nThe added benefit of using MetaMask instead of a cryptocurrency exchange is that you remain in control of your private keys and don\u2019t have to trust anyone but yourself to keep them safe.\n\nGet MetaMask\n\n5. Trust Wallet - A versatile crypto wallet that you can use to stake ETH and earn rewards\n\nTrust Wallet is a very popular all-purpose crypto wallet that is available both as a browser extension or as a standalone desktop application.\n\nOne of Trust Wallet\u2019s biggest strengths is that it supports a truly impressive selection of cryptocurrencies, as it\u2019s not just limited to EVM-compatible blockchains. You can also use Trust Wallet to store Bitcoin, XRP, Solana and many other popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nTrust Wallet has a user-friendly interface designed to cater to both beginners and experienced users. Navigating the wallet is easy, allowing users to seamlessly view their portfolio value in their preferred currency, monitor their transaction history, and effectively manage multiple wallets.\n\nYou can use Trust Wallet to securely hold your ETH and use it in liquid staking protocols to earn staking rewards. Just like MetaMask, Trust Wallet is also a non-custodial wallet, which means that you control your own private keys.\n\nGet Trust Wallet\n\nThe bottom line\n\nHopefully, this article helped explain why there are no legitimate Ethereum mining apps available on the market. However, there are still ways to earn ETH using an Android app. For example, you can stake your ETH coins through a cryptocurrency exchange app or use an Ethereum wallet app to stake your coins via protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool.\n\nIf you want to learn more on the topic of earning crypto with your phone, make sure to take a look at our list of the best crypto mining apps for Android."

Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: Ethereum continues to captivate and command attention on the crypto stage.\n\n: The content featured is created with the assistance of generative AI, accompanied by human review to ensure quality.

        "content": "Israel-based blockchain development firm COTI has made a strategic move with the launch of an Ecosystem Growth Fund targeted at accelerating Ethereum privacy.\n\nCOTI Upgrades to Layer-2\n\nAccording to a published statement, the COTI Ecosystem Growth Fund was conceived as a tool to accelerate the development and adoption of COTI V2 while ensuring transaction confidentiality. The fund which is currently valued at approximately $25 million, comes with an allocation of 400 million COTI tokens.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn the long run, it would offer support to projects from developers who are interested in contributing to the growth and success of the COTI ecosystem by researching, developing, and building within COTI V2. As such, COTI is geared up to start inking strategic partnerships with interested parties. Soda Labs, a leading player in cryptographic Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is the first project to receive funding.\n\nPrecisely, Soda Labs will focus on leading research that is targeted at expanding practical applications for garbling protocols, to ensure a secure and scalable privacy network for COTI users. Dr. Avishay Yanai, one of the co-founders of Soda Labs, confirmed the company\u2019s previous effort toward innovation in the garbling circuit protocol. Therefore, the alliance with COTI is a stepping stone towards reaching its goal.\n\nCOTI Aims to Accelerate Ethereum Privacy\n\nThe plan to advance into a Layer-2 network that encourages Ethereum privacy has been ongoing for many months but it was not until a few weeks ago that COTI commenced the gradual release of the upgrade. COTI\u2019s CEO Shahaf Bar-Geffen stated that the Ethereum privacy-centered fund marks a monumental step for the firm.\n\n\u201cThe creation of this fund by the COTI Foundation is integral in driving both the adoption of COTI V2 and the development of applications within the ecosystem,\u201d Bar-Geffen added.\n\nCOTI looks forward to making more meaningful connections in the coming months that support its newly launched Ethereum privacy vision. One of COTI\u2019s plans for the future is the addition of a developer\u2019s grant program distributed amongst milestones. This will contribute significantly to the holistic growth strategy of the COTI V2 ecosystem. This strategic move from COTI is likely to improve Ethereum adoption and integration in the long run."

        "content": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP have been trading in a \u201chigh-risk zone.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cPercent of Total Supply in Profit\u201d metric has suggested a potential upcoming market shift.\n\nThe data hasn\u2019t prophesied a crash, but the red flags are unmissable.\n\nThe three biggest cryptocurrencies \u2013 Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP \u2013 are currently flashing warning signs, according to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment. The indicator raising eyebrows is the \u201cPercent of Total Supply in Profit,\u201d which tracks the percentage of a cryptocurrency\u2019s circulating supply currently sitting in profit.\n\nOn-Chain Data Suggests Caution\n\nWith all three major coins exceeding their historical averages in this metric, concerns are mounting that a mass selloff could be on the horizon. Investors often take profits when their holdings are in the green, and with a large portion of the supply currently profitable, the temptation to sell may become irresistible.\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP have averaged between 55% and 75% of their supply in profit. All three sit above this range, firmly within what Santiment defines as the \u201chigh-risk zone.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 #Bitcoin (83%), #Ethereum (84%), and #XRPLedger (81%) have their respective supplies in historically high risk profit levels compared to their averages that hover in the 55%-75% range dating back to 2018. #Crypto can absolutely still climb due to more exposure from pic.twitter.com/ADmMcl5zhO \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 18, 2024\n\nWhile external factors like increased exposure from ETFs could still push prices higher in the short term, Santiment emphasizes that a drop below 75% supply in profit would be a \u201cgreat signal,\u201d indicating continued long-term growth.\n\nCurrently, 84% of Ethereum\u2019s supply and 83% of Bitcoin\u2019s are in the green, with XRP trailing slightly behind at 81%. Historically, these figures have often preceded significant selloffs, as investors holding profitable positions become more likely to cash out.\n\nWhile this data doesn\u2019t guarantee an imminent crash, it does raise a red flag for investors. With a large portion of each asset\u2019s supply already in profit, the potential for a mass selloff is heightened. This is especially true if broader market conditions turn sour or negative news specific to any of the three cryptocurrencies emerges.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThey posit that, as facilitated by ETFs, institutional interest might steer prices upward despite the elevated profit percentages.\n\nNot every instance of high-profit percentages has resulted in significant selloffs as the crypto market is influenced by multifaceted factors, making it challenging to predict a uniform outcome based on this metric.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe current high levels of \u201cPercent of Total Supply in Profit\u201d suggest a heightened risk of price corrections for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. While not a definitive prediction of a downturn, this metric is a valuable indicator for investors to watch as they navigate the ever-volatile world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo learn more about the impact of Bitcoin ETFs facing a ban in Singapore and the eligibility concerns surrounding it, dive into the details here:\n\nBitcoin ETFs Banned in Singapore Over Eligibility Concerns\n\n\n\nCurious about the Howey Test facing scrutiny as a judge challenges the SEC\u2019s interpretation?

        "content": "There is a secret project going on over at Meta mask and it could shake up how Ethereum works. I'm intrigued. So joining us right now is deputy managing editor of Tech and Protocols. Sam Kessler. Sam. So nice to see you. Good to see you. It's been a little while. I miss the hash days. We all do. We all know R I pr IP. All right. Tell us, tell us about the secret project, what's going on. Yeah. So Meta Mask, which is um one of the biggest crypto wallets, the biggest crypto wallet by far on Ethereum um is um putting together this secret project where they're changing the way that the app works. So conventionally, um when you're using a crypto wallet and when you're transacting on a Blockchain, more generally, what you do is you submit a transaction. So you want to trade some tokens, you'll go to unis swap, a decentralized exchange or sushi swap, another decentralized exchange and you go to one of these, you choose the, the specific specific exchange you want to go to. You say, hey, I want to sell these tokens. You find the specific price that you're gonna sell those tokens at you don't want to go above this price below this price. You specify a bunch of different things, bless you. You specify a bunch of different things. And then um what you end up doing is um submitting a a transaction um that you know, does what you specified, but now me mask and a bunch of other programs that are kind of following. Um Well, that metamask is more than one following are are switching to this idea of intents where instead of having to submit a specific transaction, what you do is you submit a general intent. The idea like, hey, I just want to sell a token, um get me the best price and then meta mask behind the scenes through some mechanism that they're putting together and that's what this news is about. Um you know, figures out how to route your transaction to get or, you know, route a series of transactions to accomplish what you want to accomplish. Um I know that's like kind of a AAA jumble of a lot of different things, but hopefully that at a high level um explains it. So what does that mean for the end user folks who are interacting with meta mask? Yeah, so I mean, the two big benefits are first user experience. Now, you don't have to, you know, suss out exactly what the best venue is for a given action on a Blockchain. There's a million different ways to do different things and you know, you don't have to do any of that leg work anymore. Um Meta mask can handle it for you in the future as this stuff rolls out. And the second thing for end users. Um So it's user experience, but the second thing is just price um fees. Um you know, all of those things that people are typically mindful of. Meta ma can take care of, they can help you avoid mev bots maximal extractable value. You can look that up. But the idea of people in the Ethereum ecosystem front running your transactions, they'll help you avoid that. They'll help you get the cheapest gas, they'll help you, you know, find the best route for your transaction. Maybe you should arbitrage a bunch of weird ways to get a better price for your tokens. I mean, this is like one example, but there's a bunch of ways where uh uh ostensibly this should help you out, but there's also some risks. I want to talk about the risks in just a second. But how did you find out about this secret? And why is it a secret? Yeah, it's a good question. And the second part, the why is it a secret plays into some of the risk question frankly. But um you know, I found out about it from just Ethereum ecosystem. People who will not be named won't be named. Don't want to be named um who kind of heard about this and for various reasons, you know, just wanted to give me, you know, bits and pieces of it. And then when I went to Meta Mask and I was like, hey, I know Xy and Z um first they were like, hey, no, um you know, please don't, you know, publish this until such and such a time. But, you know, they knew we were going to publish something anyway. And so they were willing to get on the record and the story that we published yesterday and specify the, the some of the um you know, more specific details of the, of the project. And so that's why we know with 100% certainty. Um This is what's happening. OK. Now, before we take this home, tell us about the risks, the challenges that are presented with this. Yeah. So, you know, um I, I've kind of like given the explanation of this at a high level, it's kind of like a black box, right where it's like now I put it in an intent and I say, hey, I want to sell my tokens. I want to do this, I want to do this and then meta mask handles it. What does that mean? What that means is they rely on third parties, a marketplace of third parties who auction against one another through some, you know, complicated mechanism in order to get the privilege to carry your transaction or your series of transactions or figure out what your transactions should be from point A to point B. Now again, that, that's confusing. It sounds like this kind of like a morphus thing. But what really matters at a fundamental level here is that meta mask, the biggest crypto wallet on a theory and behind, you know, so like the Lions share of transactions in decentralized finance on the, the biggest decentralized finance ecosystem is now making a fundamental change to who and how it routes your transactions where now it and at least this mechanism it's routed. Um It's creating has a ton of leeway over how it decides to funnel different transactions from users. So say, and, and I'm not saying this at all, but say meta mass for whatever reason behind the scenes decided that it was going to somehow configure its mechanism to route all trades to unis swap. There's reasons why it would do the opposite of that. But you know, say it decided to do that, that would be a big problem for users. Now, meta mask in this story explains a lot of ways why um you know how this is not centralized, this is not vertical integration, it prevents specifically against the case that I've mentioned right there. But this is something that we'll be taking a look at and the mechanism that they're putting together to assure neutrality is going to be closely scrutinized to avoid the sort of outcomes of, you know, centralized control, monopoly and also regulatory capture the idea of regulators looking at something like this and being like, huh there's a company that in some form or fashion has a big chokehold over where transactions flow in this really valuable ecosystem. Um Yeah, I it's complicated but really important as you're explaining the risks. I know two different stories, two totally different things. I was just thinking about ledger recover and the backlash that they received for that product because of uh centralization. Do you think that once this is launched, we could see similar backlash just from, from users? Yeah. So the Ledger recover case, which is a crypto wallet. Um There was like a bug or not even a bug but a capability in their software where, you know, there was a sort of backdoor situation people could go in and essentially by hacking people in a certain way, get their tokens in a manner that Ledger said it specifically prevented against. This is a little bit different because the code for this theoretically is all going to be public in in um in a way that should prevent against such a surprise. Um But it is similar um from the standpoint that the marketing of this product is going to need to match the way that it works in actual, you know, day to day, you know execution. So if meta s says we're creating this incredibly neutral, credibly, neutral and incredibly neutral platform where anybody can join in it's permissionless. Anybody can carry user, any third party can join to compete with one another to carry user transactions in a way that is, you know, neutral and balanced and so on and so forth. But then we realize that hey, some of these third parties are way more powerful and therefore accrue in the way that this system is constructed. A lot of the power. Again, we're being vague here because we don't have all the details and this market hasn't shaken out yet. But if that ends up happening, that is out of alignment with the marketing. And so people are gonna want to take a close look at it and might be concerned. Sam, thank you very much for joining me and explaining that story to us. I'm sure you'll be watching closely on next development. So we'll have you back on to tell us about the latest updates. Yeah, good to see you, Jen. Thanks for having me. That was deputy managing editor of Tech and Protocols at Coindesk. Sam Kessler."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nRecently the market sentiment on the two coins SOL and ETH has seen many price fluctuations since the start of the year. Now that Glassnode co-founders, Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, known as Negentropic, have projected Solana (SOL) to potentially outperform Ethereum (ETH) by 500% the market is curious to know if this will be true.\n\nExperts Waged Debate on Solana Price\n\nThis optimistic outlook follows discussions with macroeconomist Henrik Zeberg and Global Macroinvestor CEO Raoul Pal, who highlighted Solana\u2019s magical momentum in the SOL/ETH chart in terms of risk-adjusted returns on the Crypto Banter Show.\n\nThey both have a similar outlook on SOL\u2019s upward movement in the chart is an indicator that it will surpass ETH soon. Looking at the key trajectories of Solana, the analysts are also betting $10000 investment in SOL as they expect it will rise in the coming weeks while answering the interviewer.\n\nTo give a more concrete example, the co-founders of Glassnode look at the current SOL/ETH ratio, which is 0.14. Based on their prediction, this ratio is expected to go up a lot, possibly hitting 0.76. If this happens, it means that Solana will do four to five times better than Ethereum as the crypto market continues to rise during this bullish phase.\n\nBut he has similar hopes with ETH too. He notes that this potential outperformance could continue until the cryptocurrency market reaches its peak. Importantly, the analysis doesn\u2019t envision a solo surge for Solana; instead, it anticipates a significant bullish rally for Ethereum as well.\n\nCurrent Market Sentiments\n\nWhile Solana is currently trading at $98.55 with a 4.7% weekly decline, and Ethereum at $2,516 with a similar decline, the Glassnode founders express confidence in Solana\u2019s continued success. Despite recent fluctuations, Solana has exhibited a robust one-year trajectory, growing by 340.43% from $20. Ethereum, in comparison, has a one-year growth of 59%, rising from $1,515.\n\nSince both coins are rising on distinct parameters, the market is still divided. Only time will tell who wins."

        "content": "In an unexpected turn of events, an Ethereum (ETH) whale has reemerged from the depths of crypto hibernation to make a staggering investment in popular cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB). Etherscan data reveals that the wallet address \"0xfb2\" executed a series of purchases, acquiring a whopping 606.36 billion SHIB within the past 24 hours, amounting to a substantial $5.80 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis sudden buying spree catapults the mysterious investor to the top of the Shiba Inu token buyers' list for the given period. As a result, the whale's cryptocurrency portfolio now boasts an impressive 733.21 billion SHIB, valued at $6.97 million. Remarkably, Shiba Inu has swiftly risen to become the second-largest holding in the investor's portfolio, trailing only behind Ethereum.\n\nEthereum, with a substantial holding of 52,618 ETH, retains its position as the leading asset in the whale's portfolio, valued at an impressive $132.92 million. The cumulative value of the investor's entire portfolio currently stands at an estimated $182.76 million.\n\nDelving into on-chain data, it is evident that the initial foray into Shiba Inu by this Ethereum whale occurred two years ago. At that time, the unidentified individual procured nearly 200 billion SHIB, setting the stage for what is now a significant and attention-grabbing resurgence in their Shiba Inu holdings.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, the sudden interest of major players like this mysterious ETH whale in the Shiba Inu token adds an element of intrigue, leaving SHIB enthusiasts and traders eager to see how the situation unfolds in the days to come."

This update comes in the wake of the general market push to wriggle out of the current bearish situation that is playing out in the ecosystem thus far.\n\nCardano\u2019s market price and capitalization are down by 2.56% in the past 24 hours to $0.5177 and $18,322,533,885, respectively, as the trading volume has dropped by 15.56% to $285,507,234. Ethereum has a milder growth rate, having slipped by 0.85% in 24 hours to $2,516.35.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Cardano Advantage\n\nOver the past few months, Cardano has always recorded massive inflows from market whales. Despite the dampened sentiments overall, the IntoTheBlock data showed that a total of $13 billion in large transactions is settled on the Cardano blockchain on average daily. By definition, the platform considers ADA transactions above $100,000 in fiat value as \u2018Large.\u2019\n\nCardano whales have been quite active for the past few months. $13B in large transactions (>$100k) is being settled on Cardano daily on average. A significant amount, if you compare it to Ethereum's $5B 7-day average. pic.twitter.com/8rjeQZaonU \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 18, 2024\n\nBy comparison, Ethereum only records a total of $5 billion in whale transactions on average per week. At the moment, the bearish sentiment in the market has subtly tilted the whale transaction trend in Ethereum\u2019s favor per rate of change over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe data from IntoTheBlock shows that Ethereum\u2019s large transactions have soared by 6.74% to $4.16 in 24 hours. Cardano on the other hand maintains a larger volume pegged at $11.24 billion but with an 8.74% slump within the same period.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWill Cardano Flip Ethereum?\n\nJust the way there is a fight for dominance in the memecoin world, so also is there a foundational tussle amongst Layer-1 networks to outshine one another. One of the biggest ambitions of Cardano community members is to see the protocol flip Ethereum in market capitalization in the long term.\n\nThis is a distant dream, considering Cardano\u2019s $18.3 billion market cap is just a fraction of Ethereum\u2019s $302,549,903,898 capitalization. For the foreseeable future, Cardano may need to relish its areas of strength, including whale volume and developer activity."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price and Ethereum Prediction as Billionaire Jamie Dimon Says BTC Has 'No Value' \u2013 Is Bitcoin Going to Zero? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "In the dynamic cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) maintains stability around $42,500, despite the 1.20% downturn in the overall crypto market, now valued at $1.68 trillion. This steadiness is partly due to the excitement around the newly approved Bitcoin spot ETF, which has brought a fresh wave of investor interest, although Bitcoin\u2019s price has experienced only marginal changes.\n\nEthereum, another major player in the crypto space, mirrors this trend, with analysts closely watching its performance. Amidst this, Jamie Dimon\u2019s recent remarks labeling Bitcoin as having \u2018no value\u2019 have sparked debates and short-term uncertainty in the market.\n\n15 min TF$BTC consolidating above 42k support in a tight 42k-43k range, strong move coming soon \u2026. pic.twitter.com/P4UNOG7RK4 \u2014 Satoshi Flipper (@SatoshiFlipper) January 18, 2024\n\nYet, the broader sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, as the crypto community awaits the potential impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s anticipated interest rate cut in March and the approaching Bitcoin halving in April 2024.\n\nThese events are expected to play a significant role in shaping Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s price predictions in the near term.\n\nJamie Dimon\u2019s Criticism Sparks Short-Term Uncertainty in Bitcoin Market\n\n\n\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, recently stirred the Bitcoin market by comparing the cryptocurrency to a \u201cPet Rock\u201d during a CNBC interview. His critique has sparked some uncertainty in the crypto sphere, especially for newcomers.\n\nDimon acknowledged the promise of blockchain technology but differentiated it from Bitcoin, which he views more skeptically. While JPMorgan actively engages in tokenization with its JPM Coin, Dimon advises caution regarding Bitcoin, despite the bank\u2019s role in BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\n$JPM CEO Jamie Dimon still says he sees no value in $BTC, and doesn't want to talk about it. Here's a quote from Dimon today in an interview:\n\n\"Please stop talking about this $#!*\"\n\n\u201cI hope this is the last time I\u2019m talking about [Bitcoin], so help me god,\u201d \u2014 Market Rebellion (@MarketRebels) January 17, 2024\n\nDimon\u2019s skepticism extends to Bitcoin\u2019s intrinsic value and its potential links to illicit activities. He also expressed concern about a possible recession, pointing to factors like dwindling pandemic savings and geopolitical tensions. His comments have the potential to influence short-term market sentiment, possibly leading to fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nEthereum (ETH), another major cryptocurrency, isn\u2019t directly mentioned by Dimon, but its market often mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s trends. As a platform known for its practical applications in blockchain technology, Ethereum may be less affected by Dimon\u2019s specific criticisms of Bitcoin, but it\u2019s still subject to the broader market sentiments and economic factors impacting the crypto industry."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) alternative currently priced at $0.07 is the perfect token to Invest in Before the Actual Bull Run - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) alternative currently priced at $0.07 is the perfect token to Invest in Before the Actual Bull Run\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, savvy investors are always on the lookout for promising alternatives to established tokens like Ethereum (ETH). As we inch closer to the next anticipated bull run, one such alternative garnering significant attention is Retik Finance, currently priced at an accessible $0.07. This article delves into why Retik Finance is an ideal investment opportunity before the actual bull run.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Legacy and the Search for Alternatives\n\n\n\nEthereum, often hailed as the pioneer of smart contract platforms, has played a pivotal role in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape. Its introduction of smart contracts revolutionized the way we perceive blockchain technology, extending its applications far beyond mere financial transactions. However, with the growing demand for Ethereum, issues such as high gas fees and network congestion have become more apparent, driving the search for viable alternatives.\n\nIntroducing Retik Finance: A New Era in DeFi\n\n\n\nRetik Finance emerges as a compelling Ethereum alternative, particularly in the realm of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Priced at just $0.07, Retik Finance stands out with its unique blend of features and potential for high returns. Here\u2019s why Retik Finance is an investment worth considering:\n\n1. Accessible Pricing and High Potential\n\nAt $0.07, Retik Finance is not just affordable but also carries a high growth potential. This pricing positions Retik as an attractive entry point for both seasoned and novice investors, offering the chance to be part of a growing DeFi platform.\n\n2. Innovative DeFi Solutions\n\nRetik Finance isn\u2019t just another token; it\u2019s a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem. The platform offers innovative solutions like DeFi debit cards, next-gen payment gateways, AI-powered P2P lending, and a highly secure multi-chain wallet. These features aim to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world, making DeFi more accessible and practical for everyday use.\n\n3. Scalability and Efficiency\n\nOne of the critical advantages of Retik Finance over Ethereum is its focus on scalability and efficiency. With advanced blockchain technology, Retik aims to offer faster transaction speeds and lower fees, addressing some of the primary concerns associated with Ethereum.\n\n4. Strong Security Measures\n\nRetik Finance places a high emphasis on security. With robust protocols and continuous system audits, investors can be assured of the safety of their assets. This commitment to security is crucial, especially in a landscape where vulnerabilities can lead to significant losses.\n\n5. Community-Centric Approach\n\nA key factor driving Retik Finance\u2019s growth is its community-centric approach. The platform actively engages with its user base, ensuring that the ecosystem evolves in line with user needs and market trends. This approach not only fosters a loyal community but also ensures the platform remains relevant and user-friendly.\n\n6. Potential for High Returns\n\nGiven its innovative offerings and strategic market position, Retik Finance holds the potential for high returns, especially as we approach the next bull run. Early investors in Retik could see significant gains as the platform expands and gains more recognition in the DeFi space.\n\nEthereum vs. Retik Finance: Diversification Strategy\n\n\n\nWhile Ethereum remains a cornerstone in the crypto world, diversifying with alternatives like Retik Finance could be a strategic move. As the market dynamics shift, tokens like Retik that offer practical solutions to current blockchain challenges could see substantial growth. Investing in Retik Finance could provide a balance to Ethereum\u2019s more established but possibly slower-growing nature.\n\nPreparing for the Bull Run: The Case for Retik Finance\n\n\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market anticipates the next bull run, timing and strategic investment choices become crucial. Retik Finance, with its current pricing and promising roadmap, offers a unique opportunity. Investors looking to capitalize on the early stages of a growing platform may find Retik an ideal choice, especially considering the potential saturation and maturation of older platforms like Ethereum.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Retik Finance\n\n\n\nRetik Finance\u2019s roadmap is dotted with milestones that aim to strengthen its position in the DeFi space. The focus on integrating real-world financial applications with the crypto universe sets it apart. With plans to enhance its AI-powered P2P lending and expand the utility of its DeFi debit cards, Retik is not just positioning itself as an alternative to Ethereum but as a pioneer in a new wave of DeFi solutions.\n\nNavigating Market Volatility\n\n\n\nIn the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, diversification remains key. While Ethereum has its strengths, its limitations in scalability and efficiency present opportunities for alternatives like Retik Finance. The lower entry price of Retik also means a potentially lower risk for investors looking to explore beyond the more established tokens.\n\nCommunity and Investor Confidence\n\n\n\nA strong community and investor confidence are vital in the crypto space. Retik Finance has been building a robust community, a factor that is often indicative of a project\u2019s long-term viability. The enthusiasm and support from its community not only drive the platform\u2019s development but also help in navigating the market\u2019s ups and downs.\n\nExpert Predictions and Market Trends\n\n\n\nSeveral crypto analysts and experts have turned their attention to emerging platforms like Retik Finance. With predictions of substantial growth and the potential for high ROI, Retik is quickly becoming a part of conversations about promising crypto investments for the future.\n\nConclusion: The Time for Retik Finance is Now\n\n\n\nAs the crypto market evolves, staying ahead of trends and diversifying investment portfolios is essential. Retik Finance, with its current pricing and innovative approach to DeFi, offers a compelling opportunity for those looking to maximize their returns in the next bull run. Its combination of accessibility, security, and a community-driven approach positions it as a strong contender in the world of DeFi, making it a token worth considering for any forward-thinking investor. In conclusion, while Ethereum continues to play a significant role in the cryptocurrency market, the emergence of Retik Finance represents the dawn of a new era in DeFi \u2013 one that balances innovation with practicality and security. For investors seeking to diversify and potentially capitalize on the early stages of a promising platform, Retik Finance at $0.07 could be the golden ticket as we gear up for the upcoming bull run.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance PresaleVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\nDisclaimer: The text above is a press release that is not part of Cryptonews.com editorial content."
