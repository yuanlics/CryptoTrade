        "title": "Here's What Ethereum (ETH) Fees Can Tell Us About Price Dynamics: Analysts - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThis bullish rally can be a paradigm shift in Ethereum's L1/L2 ecosystem. Analysts foresee that by the year of 2026, Ethereum's L2 rollups will generate the majority of fees. Here's how this major indicator increased in seven months in 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH) fees \"outperformed\" Ether price; bullish sign?\n\nIn the last seven months, the cumulative volume of Ethereum (ETH) fees increased by 176%. Over a similar period, the price of the second largest cryptocurrency only grew by 53%. Last time this \"imbalance\" was registered in 2020 after two years of the Crypto Winter.\n\nIn 2023 #Ethereum fees have climbed 176% vs. the price, up 53%. The relationship between the two was instructive for the last bull market when fees outpaced price in 2020 after a two year decline. -@Jamie1Coutts pic.twitter.com/0oIF54OgOK \u2014 Chris Burniske (@cburniske) August 12, 2023\n\nCryptocurrency veteran and seasoned blockchain researcher Chris Burniske posted these observations commenting on a thesis by Bloomberg Intelligence's analyst Jamie Coutts. Burniske also admitted that the correlation between these two indicators was \"instructive\" in previous rallies.\n\nAt the same time, migration of users from Ethereum's L1 to various L2 ecosystems is a dominant process in the ecosystem that heavily affects the indicators of fees.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, the second largest Ethereum L2 Optimism (OP) surprisingly flipped Arbitrum (ARB), the #1 scaler, in a number of metrics thanks to the overhyped Worldcoin (WDC) token release.\n\nOptimism (OP) exceeded Arbitrum (ARB) in the daily transactions volume and almost managed to eclipse it in the number of active wallets.\n\nL2s on fire in 2023, but we are still early\n\nHowever, by printing time, Arbitrum's (ARB) TVL is more than twice as high as that of Optimism (OP). Arbitrum's DeFi protocols total $5.94 billion in locked assets, while Optimism-based protocols only logged $2.82 billion.\n\nThings have only just started for L2s though. In seven months only, their share in Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem fees increased by more than 3x and almost reached 14%. The number of active addresses across L2s exceeded 900,000, Coutts' report says.\n\nShould L2 adoption keep this pace, major scaling solutions like Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP) and zkSync will be responsible for 20% of Ethereum (ETH) fees by the end of 2023.\n\nIn three years, they will surpass L1's numbers, analysts conclude."

        "content": "A top-50 altcoin by market cap could be on the verge of an upside move, according to blockchain analytics platform Santiment.\n\nThe analytics platform says that the native token of smart contract-enabled blockchain Aptos (APT) could reach \u201canother higher high\u201d after partnering with software maker Microsoft on artificial intelligence (AI) and web3 projects.\n\n\u201cAptos has decoupled after its partnership with Microsoft was announced to build AI tools for blockchain integrations. The crowd showed major FOMO (fear of missing out) but has calmed down. However, rising volume and developer activity may foreshadow another higher high.\u201d\n\nAptos is trading at $7.12 at time of writing, up by over 7% in seven days.\n\nSantiment also says that Shiba Inu (SHIB) is performing relatively better compared to other mid and low-cap altcoins as traders increasingly turn their attention to the second-largest memecoin.\n\n\u201cPrices are mildly up for altcoins today, but most mid and small caps are still struggling to gain any traction on the weekly time frame. Many traders have shifted their focus to Shiba Inu, as the memecoin is one of the few bright spots. SHIB is +19% with rising social volume.\u201d\n\nShiba Inu is trading at $0.0000118 at time of writing, up over 12% in the last 24 hours.\n\nTurning to Ethereum (ETH), Santiment says that the ten largest addresses of the second-largest crypto asset by market cap now hold more than a third of the supply.\n\n\u201cEthereum has been seeing its top 10 addresses expand and accumulate more and more of the total available coin supply. In five years, the top 10 largest addresses have gone from owning 11.2% to now 34.6% of ETH. The 27.86 million ETH added is worth $51.6 billion.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,848 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A pseudonymous crypto trader is warning that the leading smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) could collapse after a big run to the upside.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Altcoin Sherpa says that it is within the realm of possibility for Ethereum to rally well above $2,000 in the coming months.\n\nHowever, the analyst says that ETH will likely see a swift and deep correction following the surge.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see something like [a move to $2,5000] and then like, you know, come back down, maybe like $1,500 or whatever. And then we just chop around. There\u2019s going to be some big rallies throughout this range. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Like, for example, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me as I said to go up to $2,500, but I\u2019m still conflicted.\n\nI don\u2019t think that $1,000 is going to come again. But it wouldn\u2019t really surprise me at all to see some late-year destruction where we get down to like $1,500. It\u2019s certainly possible in my opinion. But again, it\u2019s going to depend on the next few weeks, months on how we get up.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader appears to predict that ETH could climb to $2,500 in November of this year and decline to about $1,500 in early 2024. The chart shows ETH crossing $1,800 again sometime in March 2004.\n\nThe trader also says that ETH\u2019s price action is not convincingly forming a bull cycle.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s just an overall choppy consolidation range right now. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s truly any strong convincing move personally. Yes, you can say this is a bullish market structure, because there are higher highs and higher lows, but it\u2019s not very convincing in the sense that the higher highs are not super high. They don\u2019t convincingly break the previous highs. And the same thing with the lows. They\u2019re just kind of grinding up.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,849 at time of writing, down 0.1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Bankrupt crypto lender Voyager shifts massive amounts of Shiba Inu coins (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) to Coinbase.\n\nBankrupt crypto lender Voyager has transferred over $5 million of its assets to San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase.\n\nIn a tweet shared today by Wu Blockchain, Voyager transferred a whopping 1,500 units of ETH ($2.77 million) and 250 billion units of SHIB ($2.7 million) to Coinbase.\n\nBankrupt crypto firm Voyager transferred 1,500 ETH ($2.77 million) and 250 billion SHIB ($2.7 million) to Coinbase. Additionally, Voyager is moving all remaining tokens to the main address. There are currently about $81.63 million worth of cryptocurrency in Voyager addresses.\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 12, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, the combined value of the crypto assets moved by Voyager is worth $5.47 at the time of the report.\n\nVoyager Moves Its Assets to Main Address\n\nWhile the recent transfer may seem substantial, it is nothing compared to Voyager\u2019s extensive crypto portfolio.\n\nWu Blockchain said Voyager recently moved its remaining tokens to the main address. Per the media outlet, Voyager still holds various crypto assets valued at around $81.63 million.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nVoyager\u2019s Past Transfers of ETH & SHIB\n\nIt bears mentioning that Voyager has been moving huge amounts of its assets to Coinbase since it filed for bankruptcy. As reported by the Crypto Basic in March, Voyager shifted 250 billion SHIB (worth around $3 million) to Coinbase.\n\nIn addition, the crypto lender also moved 17,000 ETH and 12 million Voyager tokens (VGX) in different transactions. In a similar development, PeckShield reported that Voyager transferred 250B SHIB and 15K ETH to Coinbase in February.\n\n#PeckShieldAlert Voyager has transferred $28.7M worth of cryptos to crypto-exchanges, including 15k $ETH ($25.3M) to BinanceUS & Coinbase ($ETH at $1,675) & 250B $SHIB ($3.4M) to Coinbase\n\nVoyager received 105k $ETH ($ETH at $1,559 on the day of transfer) from FTX on 7th Sep. 2022 https://t.co/WiFFMRgQr0 pic.twitter.com/qw0uYvXNka \u2014 PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) February 16, 2023\n\nAs reported earlier, Voyager sold a whopping 5.62 trillion SHIB coins between February and March 2023. While Voyager sells most of its assets on Coinbase, the crypto lender also uses Binance.US and Wintermute.\n\nSHIB & ETH Prices Soar Despite Voyager\u2019s Transfers\n\nIt is worth noting that the recent transfers did not negatively impact SHIB and ETH prices. At the time of writing this line, Ethereum is up 1%, trading around $1,848.\n\nOn the other hand, Shiba Inu has risen over 9% over the past 24 hours, changing hands at $0.00001091."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nLeading cryptocurrencies finally broke a six-week spell of poor price performance or inertia this week.\n\nMarket leader Bitcoin (BTC) added a modest 1.5% to its market value over the seven days to trade at $29,408 on Saturday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the latest weekly report by CoinShares, last week was a strong indicator that institutional investors have stopped shorting the leading currency for the first time in fourteen weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest coin by market capitalization, appeared to match the top coin\u2019s pace, adding 1.3% to enter the weekend at $1,851.\n\nThere were no significant price drops among the top thirty cryptocurrencies. However, three altcoins posted notable gains.\n\nSolana (SOL) grew 8.5% to its current price of $24.55; Toncoin (TON) added 10.1% to hit $1.32, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) blew up 17.8% to trade at $0.00001108.\n\nShiba Inu appears to have kept up the momentum of last week\u2019s rally that commenced on news that the coin\u2019s makers are shedding their memecoin reputation and introducing a new identity protocol to all apps on the ecosystem for increased security and privacy.\n\nAltogether the market made small gains this week, as July\u2019s U.S. inflation readings indicated a continued cooling off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the news...\n\nThis week brought a fairly busy and diverse news cycle, with institutional and global adoption stories commanding attention alongside the Fed\u2019s new stablecoin note and the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s face-saving tactics in its failing war on crypto.\n\nOn Monday, payments giant PayPal announced it would be releasing an Ethereum-based dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD (PYUSD).\n\nThe currency will be issued by Paxos and is expected to become \"a part of the overall payments infrastructure,\" according to a media quote by PayPal CEO Dan Schulman.\n\nStarting next month, Paxos will be publishing monthly reserve reports and third-party attestations of PYUSD\u2019s reserves, enabling the public to keep track of the credibility and value of the assets underpinning the stablecoin\u2019s value.\n\nDemocratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) aired her concerns in a written statement: \u201cI am deeply concerned that PayPal has chosen to launch its own stablecoin while there is still no Federal framework for regulation, oversight and enforcement of these assets. [...] Given PayPal\u2019s size and reach, Federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Brazil announced the name of its new central bank digital currency (CBDC): DREX, or the \u201cdigital real\u201d\u2014 the name being a near-acronym for \u201cdigital real electronic transaction.\u201d\n\nThe digital real is a centrally-issued tokenized real that utilizes distributed ledger technology similar to blockchain, but it\u2019s not without controversy.\n\nEarly last month, the Brazilian Central Bank published the code of the pilot project on its GitHub profile. Developers thus discovered several problematic functions within the smart contract.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe capabilities given to the Central Bank include the ability to freeze users' accounts, decrease target balances, confiscate, and mint new units of the digital currency. This, in turn, has attracted criticism that the project enforces exactly the kind of centralization crypto was created to avoid.\n\nThat day, Binance announced it had secured licenses to operate in El Salvador, a country where Bitcoin is legal tender. Binance has been feeling the heat of the SEC\u2019s spotlight in the U.S. after the federal securities regulator sued it for breaching securities laws, alleging further still that Binance execs are involved in commingling customer funds and market manipulation.\n\nAlso that day, the Federal Reserve issued a statement announcing incoming guidance for chartered banks dealing with dollar-pegged stablecoins. It also said it was stepping up its \u201cnovel activities supervision program\u201d for banks dealing with crypto or crypto companies in its jurisdiction.\n\nIn particular, the Fed is looking to monitor the transaction validation process, including the \u201ctiming and finality of settlement of transactions, potential irreversibility of transactions, and the central authority of transaction records.\u201d\n\nThe statement hints that the Fed will implement know-your-client (KYC) measures and ensure that nationally-chartered banks demonstrate appropriate risk-mitigation strategies.\n\nOn Friday, the SEC announced it plans to appeal Judge Torres\u2019s landmark ruling in the agency\u2019s ongoing lawsuit against Ripple for\u2014you guessed it\u2014breaching securities laws.\n\nTorres ruled that Ripple\u2019s XRP was not a security by definition but could be presented as one depending on how it\u2019s sold. Her verdict essentially contradicted the SEC\u2019s claim that offerings to retail customers via exchanges constitute securities offerings.\n\nThe following day, the SEC once more played for time and delayed its decision to approve or reject a high-profile spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund application from ARK 21Shares.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, on Saturday payments giant Visa announced an experimental solution on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to pay gas fees using Visa credit or debit cards."
