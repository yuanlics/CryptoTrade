They provide a common language and set of guidelines for developers, enabling composability and interaction between applications and the network. ERC standards are important for enabling features like transaction processing, fungibility, and security, and for ensuring compatibility between applications and the network.\n\nThe article lists 10 of the most commonly used ERC standards, including ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155. These standards are used for various purposes, such as creating fungible or non-fungible tokens, enabling type introspection, and fractional ownership of assets.\n\nThe pros of using ERC standards include facilitating composability and interaction between applications and the network, enhancing the functionality of the network, and establishing a common language and set of guidelines for developers. However, there are also cons to using ERC standards, such as requiring proper knowledge of blockchain and programming, and the uncertainty and delay in the deployment of new token standards.\n\nOverall, ERC standards are crucial"
