        "content": "Exotic derivatives protocol Cega Finance will be launching on Ethereum mainnet, branching out from its native Solana.\n\nIn traditional finance, exotic options fill the same role, more or less, as regular options \u2014 enabling leveraged longs and shorts on an underlying asset, but they can be used to achieve specific investment goals that cannot be accomplished with American or European options.\n\nFor example, Barrier options have a payoff that depends on whether the underlying asset price reaches a certain barrier level during the life of the option, while Asian options\u2019 payoff depends on the average price of the asset over a period of time.\n\n\u201cExotic options are a natural evolution in an economic market,\u201d Arisa Toyosaki, Cega Finance co-founder, told Blockworks. \u201cThey are a conditional option on top of a vanilla option.\u201d\n\nSeasoned investors can use exotic options to dial in risk preferences while trading a wider range of investment products.\n\nLeveraged options vaults\n\nCega also supports structured vault products pitched to enable yields during volatile market environments.\n\nThe protocol will be offering a leveraged options vault (LOV) strategy, expected to launch within the second quarter. This option will be offered on top of the products which are already available to those on the Solana blockchain.\n\nLOV is an options structured product that Toyosaki believes will resolve capital inefficiency in DeFi as it \u201cdoes not require additional liquidity accessed through redemptions of user-funded margins or overcollateralization.\u201d\n\nLOV\u2019s Gotta Go Fast offering, for example, offers a 21% to 30% APY. The underlying assets will be BTC, ETH and SOL, and Cega says it will offer a 50% principal protection barrier.\n\nToyosaki notes that in order to take a leverage position in the existing market, the amount of capital that must be staked \u2014 but never put to work \u2014 is significant.\n\n\u201cWe created a method for our leverage options vaults that is extremely capital efficient and allows you to get a leveraged return by having a combination of options which can maximize your appetite for the market,\u201d she said.\n\nLOV liquidations work like this, Blockworks Research analyst Ren Yu Kong explains:\n\nA user deposits crypto into a vault for a set time period of time \u2014 for example, 30 days; and\n\nif BTC, ETH, or SOL drop by over 50% across that period, then;\n\nthe 50% principal protection barrier has expired, requiring collateral to be taken.\n\n\u201cFrom there, the vault takes the worst-performing asset. Say BTC decreased by 30%, ETH decreased by 45%, SOL decreased by 60%. Then the vault will return 40% (100-60) of your initial deposit,\u201d Kong said.\n\nOn top of LOV, Cega is also launching a trading firm, Tras Mobian. The entity is designed to resolve one-sided demand issues in decentralized financial markets.\n\n\u201cIf you look at every DeFi option vault in the market, everyone is focused on selling options. There hasn\u2019t been a lot of demand for users buying options,\u201d Toyosaki said.\n\nThis is where Tras Mobian comes in. It will be focused on research and development in the space, according to Toyosaki, with the hopes of creating more demand for both sides of the market.\n\nTas Mobian will run independently of Cega, the company notes. A third-party custodian will manage its multisig and oversee its balance sheets and audits.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
