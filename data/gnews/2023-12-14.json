        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its review of Invesco Galaxy\u2019s Ethereum (ETH) spot ETF.\n\nSetting a new deadline of Feb. 6, the SEC has pushed back the applications of a spot ETH ETF that would allow the Cboe BZX Exchange to list and trade shares of the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF.\n\n\u201cThe 45th day after publication of the notice for this proposed rule change is December 23, 2023. The Commission is extending this 45-day time period.\u201d SEC\n\nIn September, asset managers Invesco and Galaxy Digital submitted a joint filing to SEC to launch an Ethereum-based ETF. The tool will reflect the spot price of the second-largest cryptocurrency by capitalization. ETH will be stored by a separate custodian, who has not yet been named. The SEC was supposed to decide on the application by Dec. 23.\n\nYou might also like: Invesco submits new spot bitcoin ETF application\n\nIn addition to Invesco, last week the Commission announced that it will not have time to consider Grayscale\u2019s application to launch spot ETF on ETH until the end of 2023. The delay is due to the lack of time required to conduct an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler previously said that long approval processes are due to the comprehensiveness of risk assessments relating to the U.S. financial system.\n\nRead more: Grayscale Investments CEO hints at optimistic scenario for spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Early Ethereum investors Konstantin Lomashuk and Vasiliy Shapovalov are re-upping their financial interests in new technologies with the \"re-launching\" of an investment firm called cyber.Fund, which plans to invest $100 million of the founders' capital.\n\n\"This new $100 million fund will serve current portfolio companies and as well as service new projects and teams,\" cyber.Fund said in a post to X on Thursday. \"Its mission is to accelerate the transition to an open cybernetic economy by backing entrepreneurs innovating in blockchain, AI, robotics and adjacent technologies.\"\n\n\n\nCyber.Fund is headed by Konstantin Lomashuk and Vasiliy Shapovalov, both of whom say they invested in Ethereum in 2014. When asked why now, Lomashuk told The Block the motivation centers around furthering the development of these newer technologies. \"We believe that we can accelerate the technologies by investing capital,\" said Lomashuk.\n\nThe $100 million investment firm is being funded entirely with capital from cyber.Funds' founders, a spokesperson said by email.\n\nAlthough the flow of fresh capital into crypto and blockchain enterprises has continued during the last year, the amount of money being invested has slowed considerably from what it was during the bull run. Meanwhile, investment in artificial intelligence has soared, spurred partly by interest in projects like ChatGPT.\n\nEarly believers in top crypto projects\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBefore this re-launch, cyber.Fund was primarily active between 2014 and 2018, according to Lomashuk. The firm not only invested early in projects like Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot and Solana, but also helped build Lido Finance and P2P, according to Thursday's announcement. Lomashuk co-founded Lido Finance.\n\n\"Our aim is to create a more open, efficient and sustainable economy,\" cyber.Fund said in the post. \"We believe that by working to accelerate the growth, adoption and eventual decentralization of the these technologies, the world will enter a new age of unprecedented prosperity.\"\n\nCyber-Fund considers the emergence of a \"cybernetic\" world as inevitable and sees blockchain, robotics and AI playing a key role in shaping this new paradigm.\n\n\"We invested in Ethereum and build staking to keep it censorship resistant and decentralized,\" said Lomashuk. Now, \"instead of building we can invest in founders with the same values to build open source [technologies] good for humanity.\""

        "content": "The network of Ethereum layer-2 rollups using zkSync\u2019s ZK Stack got a new addition Thursday, with the launch of the Cronos zkEVM testnet.\n\nBlockchain developer Cronos Labs is developing its third blockchain, which is the first to use ZK Stack hyperchain to reach a live testnet.\n\nThe first chain in the Cronos ecosystem was a Cosmos appchain developed in partnership with the Crypto.com exchange and launched in 2021. Cronos then followed up with an EVM-compatible chain, also built using the Cosmos SDK in 2022. This new effort augments, but does not replace, the prior two chains.\n\nCronos\u2019 zkEVM is the result of a collaborative effort involving Cronos Labs, Matter Labs (the team behind zkSync), and several engineering teams from stakeholders Crypto.com and dapp developers on the existing chains.\n\nThe zkEVM testnet is built on top of the Ethereum Sepolia testnet and leverages zkSync\u2019s new open-source prover, Boojum, a STARK-based zero-knowledge proof system, notable for its low hardware requirements and low fees in the layer-2 rollup space.\n\nRead more: Polygon Zero and Matter Labs square off over open-source norms\n\nLaunching a native Ethereum chain was motivated by frustrations with bridging across EVM chains and between Cosmos and Ethereum, according to Ken Timsit, managing director at Cronos.\n\n\u201cWhen we started building Cronos as an EVM chain, we were, of course, already convinced that the Ethereum developer ecosystem has richness and robustness that has no comparison when it comes to building DeFi and NFT applications,\u201d Timsit told Blockworks.\n\nGood relations with Matter Labs and a desire to contribute to the open source development of the ZK Stack led them to take the next step.\n\nHyperchains share components of the ZK Stack, including a shared native bridge to the Ethereum mainnet and zkSync\u2019s trustless bridging mechanism, in which assets remain secured by Ethereum.\n\nIt will also benefit from zkSync\u2019s native account abstraction, which allows transactions fee payment in various cryptocurrencies, such as Cronos\u2019 token (CRO).\n\n\u201cWhen you look at legacy chains, it\u2019s very hard to migrate Ethereum assets, for example, to account abstraction enabled wallets,\u201d Timsit said. \u201cAnd so for us, starting by default with account abstraction is a way to take advantage of what this technology offers, better than what we can do on a chain which already has an ecosystem of wallets and tokens.\u201d\n\nCronos\u2019 zkEVM is expected to progress to mainnet in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nGrowing hyperchains\n\nA handful of other hyperchains are in development using the ZK Stack, notably GRVT, (pronounced \u201cgravity\u201d) a derivatives exchange, and Tradable, which is working on bringing private credit on-chain.\n\nTradable intends to have an institutional focused hyperchain, eventually forming a decentralized chain alongside other institutional partners, according to Omar Azhar, Matter Labs head of business development.\n\n\u201cI think what you might start seeing is app specific chains and then ecosystem specific chains,\u201d Azhar told Blockworks.\n\nMatter Labs sees the zkSync hyperchain as strictly a better option than app-specific chains in Cosmos, such as Cronos\u2019 earlier efforts, said Marco Cora, senior vice president of business and operations. That\u2019s because Cosmos chains generally must provide for their own validator set and security, and lack native token bridges to Ethereum.\n\n\u201cIf you are an appchain developer, why are you taking on these two extra projects that you shouldn\u2019t really focus on: building the bridge and bootstrapping the security?\u201d Cora told Blockworks.\n\nThe ZK Stack competes with other well-funded networks building zkEVM chains, including Polygon, whose Chain Development Kit (CDK) shares many of the same goals, and StarkWare\u2019s Starknet, the progenitor of STARK prover technology which both Polygon and zkSync have iterated upon.\n\nHyperchains can also serve the purpose of private blockchain frameworks such as Hyperledger or Corda, Cora said, but with all the benefits of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThey are technically highly scalable, but they practically don\u2019t scale. When you speak with most enterprises, they tell you this is way too expensive for what it is for me,\u201d he said.\n\nAside from cost considerations, there\u2019s the social coordination problem.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re Goldman Sachs, you don\u2019t want to join the Morgan Stanley Chain just because it\u2019s the Morgan Stanley Chain. If you\u2019re Fidelity, you don\u2019t want to join the BlackRock Chain just because it\u2019s the BlackRock Chain and so on and so forth,\u201d Cora said.\n\n\u201cBut if the sponsor of the chain\u2026forced himself to create a zero knowledge proof and to hand this proof to a third party \u2014 which is Ethereum \u2014 they now can claim a much higher degree of credible neutrality,\u201d he added. \u201cNow, this party cannot mess with the system.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
