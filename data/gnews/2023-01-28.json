        "content": "An analyst who correctly called this year\u2019s crypto turnaround and bought Bitcoin and Ethereum in November says his bullish stance on the market will change if BTC falls below a key support level.\n\nPseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 46,800 YouTube subscribers that he while Bitcoin\u2019s rally from 2022\u2019s low is significant, the bull case for the king crypto could be invalidated if the top crypto asset by market cap falls below the $19,000 level.\n\n\u201c[Bitcoin is] up 50% since the low [~ $15,500], which is quite significant\u2026 [It is] chilling above areas that it has to be above. And as long as we don\u2019t lose $18,000/$19,000, nothing changes. I\u2019m going to be bullish until we lose $19,000.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $23,044 at time of writing, a fractional gain during the last 24 hours. According to the trader, Bitcoin could even plunge below its 2022 low of $15,500 if the $19,000 support level crumbles.\n\n\u201cIf you go down to $19,000\u2026 then you\u2019d make new lows.\u201d\n\nDonAlt says he\u2019s holding onto his positions and believes the current crypto rally is not over yet.\n\nHowever, If Bitcoin continues an upward trend, DonAlt says his preferred level to take profits is around the $32,000 price tag.\n\n\u201cJust makes sense to be bullish. But I don\u2019t know where to buy pullbacks and I don\u2019t know where to take profits other than $32,000, just based on the fact that I wouldn\u2019t want to sell into [the] $24,000 level. I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like any monthly level either unless it\u2019s like $35,000, which is roughly in the area of $32,000 as well.\u201d\n\nAs for Ethereum, the trader says he remains bullish although ETH has under-performed compared to Bitcoin in recent days.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t see much resistance until the second-largest crypto asset reaches the $2,200 area.\n\n\u201cMy thesis is basically we retested the monthly support at $1,100 and there\u2019s no real level that I like between $1,100 and $2,2200 \u2013 so let\u2019s go to $2,200.\u201d\n\nOverall, DonAlt says he\u2019s mainly watching Bitcoin to ensure it holds its key support level, and he will make decisions on altocins based on how it performs.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum addresses with a non-zero balance rise to reach an all-time high.\n\nThe king alt\u2019s percent supply in profit also crossed over the 60 mark.\n\nOver the years, there has been a growth in Ethereum [ETH] addresses, and the most recent merging has further stoked curiosity. While the price of Ethereum declined for the majority of the previous year, one statistic was increasing and just reached an all-time high.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nPositive addresses surge in number\n\nThroughout the years, the number of Ethereum addresses has grown dramatically. Glassnode reports that the current number of addresses exceeds 92 million, a new record. More significantly, though, is the rising trend in the total number of addresses where the balance is anything other than zero.\n\nThe \u201cnumber of addresses with a Non-Zero balance\u201d measures the proportion of all addresses on the blockchain with a positive value, indicating that they have at least some Ether (ETH).\n\nInvestors are beginning to liquidate their holdings and exit the market when this statistic drops in value. Following a steep decline in cryptocurrency prices, this pattern may become apparent.\n\nAs the indicator rises, however, it suggests that new investors are filling their wallets. The move might be signaling the beginning of a bull market.\n\nSeveral variables may be responsible for the recent surge in address activity, but two stand out as particularly plausible explanations. For the greater part of the past year, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has been declining.\n\nNew and seasoned investors could increase their holdings or enter the market. In addition, ETH now had a new utility thanks to the Ethereum merge last year. Following the merge, a new type of investor was created, thanks to the staking feature.\n\nPercent supply in profit increases\n\nLooking at another important indicator could provide further information about the state of Ethereum (ETH), given the metric\u2019s accumulation trend.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the circulating supply of Ethereum was over 122 million. More than 50% of the supply, as measured by the percent supply in profit, was profitable. The percent supply in profit was just over 68% as of the time of writing.\n\nETH price is in decline, but\u2026\n\nAs of this writing, the daily trading price of Ethereum was around $1567. A decline in value was also seen within the time frame that was analyzed. Its value had dropped by almost 2%, bringing the total drop in the previous 48 hours to roughly 3%.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nThe same-period analysis of the Relative Strength Index revealed that the market was now in a downturn. With a further price decline, the RSI, which was at 60, might decline further. But according to the RSI line, it was still in a bull trend despite the decline."

        "content": "The functionality of a cryptocurrency is important to help it stand out in a packed industry sector. By having numerous enticing features, cryptocurrencies can appeal to and attract a large number of investors. Big Eyes Coin, Bitcoin and Ethereum are three cryptocurrencies currently appealing to investors with a myriad of exciting and distinctive features.\n\nBig Eyes Coin \u2013 New ROI Calculator Feature Impresses Investors\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG) is the new meme coin, making a big impact in the fast-paced crypto world. The coin has a number of notable features, including its charity wallet, NFT space and its newest ROI calculator feature, which is attracting investors by the score.\n\nThis calculator allows users to visualise what returns they could make on their investments. For instance, users can see how much they would make if Big Eyes Coin hits $1. If someone purchased $385 worth, then that could be worth a huge $1 million if the coin reached a price of $1.\n\nFrom donating to a number of important charities to holding a charity wallet containing 5% of tokens, one thing is for sure; Big Eyes Coin is a cryptocurrency with morals.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 And The Rest Was History\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a decentralised digital currency, ranking as the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalisation, name recognition and often desirability for new investors. The coin launched in 2009 and has left its mark on the finance industry, starting a new beginning in the digital world.\n\nBitcoin operates with no central control, banks or governments. Each transaction is noted by a public ledger, meaning copies can be held on servers all over.\n\nEvery transaction is shared between nodes after being publicly broadcast to the network. After mere minutes transactions are collected by miners into a block and added to the blockchain for eternity. This is known as Bitcoin\u2019s account book.\n\nBitcoins\u2019 success is impressive and enduring, and the crypto giant helped pave the way for a financial revolution.\n\nEthereum \u2013 Decentralised Crypto\n\nEthereum (ETH) is largely considered to be the second most popular cryptocurrency. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) has some well-known founding members, including industry giants Microsoft, Intel and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nEthereum encompasses many features and applications, helping to differentiate it from its biggest rival Bitcoin. The Ethereum platform enables the creation of decentralised applications and is not run by any centralised authority.\n\nFor cryptocurrencies, having excellent functionality is an important part of standing out from the crowd and attracting investors. Big Eyes Coin has created a platform where you can visualise predicted gains, helping new investors gain a better understanding of profitability and potential return on investment.\n\nHaving already raised $18 million in its presale, Big Eyes Coin is set for big things. Early investors can take advantage of its attractive 200% launch bonus offer using the code LAUNCHBIGEYES200. Every token purchased will receive a bonus of 2 extra tokens at no extra cost, effectively trebling an initial stake.\n\nFor More On Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
