Plasma networks are \"child\" chains of the Ethereum mainnet that execute transactions off-chain and periodically post final states back to the mainnet.

However, the previous implementation of Plasma, known as Plasma Cash, had issues with misbehaving operators and defragmentation protocols.\n\nTo address these concerns, Buterin is proposing the use of zk-SNARKS and validity proofs to prove the validity of each Plasma block without revealing the contents of the transactions. This would allow for instant withdrawals and eliminate the need for complex ownership structures. However, there are still limitations to the Plasma design, such as the challenge of handling state objects without clear economic owners.\n\nButerin believes that Plasma remains an underrated design in the blockchain technology space and could help ease Ethereum transaction fees.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink views Bitcoin's price rally as a sign of \"pent-up interest in crypto,\" but the update has failed to catalyze ETH price gains so far."
