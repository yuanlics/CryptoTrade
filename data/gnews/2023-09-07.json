        "summary": "  Ethereum whales have purchased over 200,000 ETH in the past 24 hours, despite the ongoing bear market. This significant accumulation of ETH is worth $425 million. The purchases were made amidst a decline in price and a surge in selling activity, indicating that large investors are taking advantage of the current discounted prices. The development contrasts with previous bullish sentiment observed in late 2022, with large Ethereum holders exhibiting bearish behavior since April. Analysts attribute the continued weakness in Ether's price to dominant bearish sentiment among futures traders, as indicated by a declining 30-day moving average of the taker buy-sell ratio. For Ethereum to embark on a new bullish trajectory, there needs to be a shift in behavior among futures traders, characterized by more aggressive buying."
