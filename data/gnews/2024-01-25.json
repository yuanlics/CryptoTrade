        "title": "Ethereum Dencun Upgrade Q1 Release on Track? Developers Confirm Schedule Despite Initial Snags - DailyCoin",
        "summary": "  The article discusses the latest development on the Ethereum network, specifically the Dencun upgrade, which is expected to launch in Q1 2024. Despite experiencing some challenges during its first testnet outing on Goerli, the upgrade is still on track, according to Ethereum core developers. The Dencun upgrade will introduce proto-danksharding, which aims to address Ethereum's scaling challenges by cutting fees for end users. The upgrade will also be rolled out on Sepolia and Holesky testnets in the coming days, and developers are urging validators to upgrade to Dencun-supported clients to ensure a smooth upgrade experience. While unforeseen challenges on Sepolia and Holesky could still impact the Dencun launch timeline, the recent announcement from developers suggests that the upgrade is still on track for a Q1 2024 mainnet release."

        "summary": "  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has poured cold water on the chances of approving a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to a recent media briefing. Gensler emphasized that the SEC's approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this month is limited to this one commodity and should not be interpreted as having any broader implications. He also mentioned that the SEC has delayed its decision on BlackRock's spot Ethereum ETF proposal, pushing the deadline to March 10.\n\nCrypto experts remain optimistic that a spot Ethereum ETF could be approved this year, with some analysts predicting a May 2024 approval. However, SEC Chair Gensler's comments suggest that the agency is not currently considering approval of an Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn addition to the ETF approval, the SEC is also embroiled in legal battles with multiple crypto firms, including Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple. The SEC has filed lawsuits against these fir"

        "summary": "  The Ethereum network is set to undergo an upgrade called Dencun, which will expand to two additional test networks, Sepolia and Holesky, by early February. The Dencun upgrade is expected to scale the Ethereum blockchain by introducing a new transaction type called a blob-carrying transaction, which will lower the cost of transacting on the network. The upgrade is named after Deneb, a star in the Cygnus constellation, and Cancun, the city location for Devcon 3. The upgrade is expected to go live on mainnet next, assuming the Sepolia and Holesky upgrades go smoothly."

        "summary": "  BlackRock, a financial giant, has applied for a spot Ethereum ETF, but the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking its time to make a decision. The SEC has pushed back the timeline for a decision to March 10, and there is speculation that the SEC may not make any decisions on spot Ethereum ETFs before then. Some analysts, such as James Seyffart of Bloomberg, predict that the ETFs may be approved in May. However, Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, has expressed skepticism towards spot trackers linked to assets other than Bitcoin, suggesting that the music may not play in their favor. BlackRock's application for a spot Ethereum ETF was filed in November 2023."

        "summary": "  According to the article, a total of $5.82 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options are set to expire on January 26th. This event has the potential to significantly impact the prices of both leading digital assets.\n\nFor Bitcoin, there is a high level of open interest in the $50,000 strike price, with over $360 million in options contracts set to expire. This suggests that there may be a significant amount of buying or selling activity in the BTC market around this price level. Additionally, the put/call ratio for BTC is 0.52, indicating a slightly more bearish sentiment among traders.\n\nFor Ethereum, the situation is different. The put/call ratio for ETH is 0.31, indicating a more bullish sentiment among traders. There is also significant open interest in the $2,400 strike price, with around $200 million in options contracts set to expire.\n\nOverall, the expiration of these options could lead to fluctuations in the digital asset market, particularly in the"

        "summary": "  Celsius, a bankrupt crypto lender, has been transferring a significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) to exchanges, causing concerns among investors about a potential sell-off. According to the article, Celsius has moved around 281,000 ETH (worth $621 million) to exchanges since the approval of its restructuring plan, which is twice the amount anticipated by market participants. The article notes that Celsius is unlikely to sell all of its ETH, as it is committed to settling most creditor claims, including an estimated $2.1 billion allocation to retail customers, with a mix of liquid crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC), ETH, and Tether (USDT). The firm's restructuring plan names Coinbase as a distribution partner, and it is unclear when it will start distributing assets to creditors and customers. Former Celsius customers have expressed concerns about the capabilities of US Bitcoin, the firm assigned to manage the new creditor-owned Bitcoin mining firm, and some argue that the firm is in a weakened financial position.

While some analysts believe that Ether (ETH) has the potential to become a market leader in the coming months and should be a core holding in a diversified crypto portfolio, the options market is currently showing a bias towards price weakness over the next three months. Specifically, the one-week call-put skew for Ether has fallen to its lowest level in over three months, indicating a preference for bets that Ether's price will decline. This suggests that the options market may be bearish on Ethereum, despite the predictions of analysts."

The upgrade will first be tested on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets before being deployed to the mainnet. The testing phase is expected to begin on January 30 and February 7, respectively, and if everything goes smoothly, the upgrade will be rolled out to the mainnet.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is part of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) series and includes nine features, such as transient storage opcodes, Beacon block root in the EVM, shard blob transactions, and others. The upgrade follows in the footsteps of the Shapella upgrade, which activated staking on the Beacon Chain after the Ethereum blockchain switched to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.\n\nIn other news, the Ethereum network is the second most valuable blockchain-based protocol after the Bitcoin network, controlling 19% of the emerging"

        "summary": "  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended the deadline for a decision on BlackRock's proposed spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) to March 10. The SEC previously had a deadline of January 25 to approve, disapprove, or further delay the decision. BlackRock applied for a spot ether ETF in November 2023, following the approval of nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10. The approval of Ethereum ETFs is expected to be successful, as the legal realities that pushed the SEC to approve Bitcoin ETFs will likely apply to Ethereum as well. SEC Commissioner Hester \"Crypto Mom\" Peirce suggested that a drawn-out court battle may not be necessary to convince the SEC to approve spot Ether applications. If approved, it would be the first time professional American investors can gain exposure to Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap."
