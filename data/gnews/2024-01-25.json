This pales in comparison to Polygon's meteoric rise \u2013 it onboarded over 15 million new users last year, almost rivaling Ethereum's growth.\n\nEthereum still led overall with 15.4 million new users in 2023. But Polygon followed closely behind with 15.2 million, despite being a layer-2 network built on Ethereum.\n\nIn contrast, Base saw an initial spike of enthusiasm fizzle out into sluggish adoption. On the bright side, it now faces competition from alternative layer-2s with more mature ecosystems like Arbitrum (7.3 million 2023 users).\n\nAs one of Ethereum's most prominent scaling solutions, Polygon's explosive user growth demonstrates the immense potential of layer-2 technology. By delivering faster and cheaper transactions, it serves as a blueprint for how Base could also take advantage of Ethereum's mainstream adoption.\n\nBut Polygon had a multi-year head start in building its developer ecosystem compared to the Base network."

        "content": "The SEC has postponed its decision on BlackRock's proposed Ethereum ETF to March 10, 2024. This reflects the regulator's cautious approach toward crypto-based investment products and highlights the need for clearer regulatory frameworks in the digital assets space.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on BlackRock's proposed spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), a move that echoes the regulator's cautious approach toward cryptocurrency-based investment products. This decision, announced just a day before the initial deadline of January 25, 2024, marks a significant moment in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation and investment.\n\nThe application for the iShares Ethereum Trust was filed by Nasdaq on behalf of BlackRock on November 21, 2023, and was published for comment in the Federal Register on December 11, 2023\u200b\u200b. The SEC, under Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act, had a 45-day window to make a decision, which could be extended up to 90 days if deemed necessary\u200b\u200b. The Commission has now designated March 10, 2024, as the new deadline to either approve, disapprove, or initiate proceedings to ascertain the appropriateness of the proposed rule change\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThis delay is part of a broader trend of postponements by the SEC concerning cryptocurrency ETFs. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that such delays are expected to continue sporadically over the coming months, with significant attention focused on May 23rd as a key date for further decisions on spot Ether ETF applications\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe SEC's cautious stance is indicative of the broader regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies. While some industry insiders like Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, remain optimistic about eventual approval, others like Morgan Creek Capital CEO Mark Yusko express skepticism, citing the SEC's generally hostile attitude toward the crypto industry\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe implications of these delays are far-reaching. Investors and market watchers are keenly observing the SEC's moves, as they could set precedents for future cryptocurrency-related financial products. The decision-making process also highlights the ongoing debate about the classification and regulation of cryptocurrencies as securities, a topic that has been at the forefront of discussions in the crypto and financial sectors.\n\nIn conclusion, the SEC's postponement of its decision on BlackRock's Ethereum ETF reflects the regulator's careful approach in dealing with crypto-based investment products. This move, while causing a stir in the cryptocurrency community, underscores the need for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to navigate the complex and evolving world of digital assets.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

Around this time, the SEC is also likely to make decisions on other similar applications, including BlackRock\u2019s.\n\nThe SEC has also postponed proceedings on Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF earlier this month. However, these delays will not affect the critical May deadline for a decision.

Ethereum\u2019s distinctive characteristics, which do not align neatly with traditional investment categories, add complexity to the approval process.\n\nThis skepticism is shared by analysts at JPMorgan, who point out the uncertainty in how the SEC will categorize Ethereum \u2013 whether as a standard commodity or otherwise \u2013 in its upcoming May decision.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 The delay could affect the other spot #Ethereum ETF applications that have deadlines from May 23 to August 3, 2024 pic.twitter.com/hJ86Yeeff1 \u2014 Budhil Vyas (@BudhilVyas) January 25, 2024\n\nEthereum ETF As a Sign of Growing Crypto Adoption\n\nThe concept behind the proposed investment vehicle is to offer investors exposure to Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. In a recent CNBC interview, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expressed his support for an Ethereum ETF. He stated that he sees \u201cvalue in having an Ethereum ETF\u201d and views the approval of such funds as \u201cjust stepping stones towards tokenization\u201d.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF received approval on January 10 and commenced trading the following day. Among the 10 ETFs now trading, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, managed by BlackRock, has been particularly successful. It boasts $1.7 billion in assets under management, underscoring the growing interest and trust in cryptocurrency-based investment products."

        "content": "Ethereum, the linchpin of the decentralized application ecosystem, finds itself navigating a precarious path this week. The cryptocurrency\u2019s value, having breached the pivotal $2,250 support level, now teeters on the edge of a decisive crossroads, caught between the prospect of a resurgence and the looming threat of a more pronounced downturn.\n\nAnalyzing the technical landscape reveals a cautious narrative, as ominous bearish trendlines emerge on the hourly charts of the Kraken exchange, while a resilient resistance at $2,240 presents a formidable obstacle.\n\nEthereum: Uphill Battle And Key Levels To Watch\n\nThe journey to reclaim lost ground demands a Herculean effort from Ethereum, necessitating the conquering of the initial hurdle at $2,240 and then engaging in a formidable battle against the $2,280 resistance. The digital asset\u2019s fate hangs in the balance, with the outcome likely to shape its trajectory in the coming days.\n\nETH price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko\n\nHowever, should Ethereum stumble in this uphill climb, a safety net awaits at $2,200, providing a temporary buffer against a further decline to $2,000.\n\nBut amidst the technical turmoil, a ray of sunshine pierces through the clouds. Market sentiment around Ethereum remains surprisingly upbeat. Despite the price dip, the volume of net profits locked in by ETH investors has hit a multi-year high, suggesting a shift in focus from short-term gains to long-term holding.\n\nEthereum\u2019s High-Wire Act: Key Metrics\n\nThis newfound patience is further corroborated by the skyrocketing net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) metric for short-term token-holders. This figure, reflecting the potential profitability of investors based on their purchase price, has for the first time since the November 2021 all-time high, surpassed 0.25, signifying a surge in confidence among those who recently acquired ETH.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,220 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nThe current scenario resembles a high-wire act, except the stakes are considerably higher. Technical charts flash cautionary signals, but market sentiment whispers sweet nothings of optimism. Whether Ethereum finds its footing and ascends, or takes a misstep and plummets, remains to be seen.\n\nAt A Glance\n\nEthereum faces near-term technical challenges with resistance points at $2,240 and $2,280.\n\nSupport lies at $2,200 and $2,165, with a breach below $2,000 a possibility.\n\nDespite the price dip, market sentiment around Ethereum remains positive.\n\nRecord-high net profits locked in and rising NUPL for short-term holders suggest long-term optimism.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s path forward remains shrouded in uncertainty, the technical picture paints a potentially bleak outlook. With resistance levels looming large and support thin on the ground, a slide towards the psychologically significant $2,000 mark cannot be ruled out. However, the resilient optimism amongst investors, evidenced by locked-in profits and rising NUPL, suggests a hidden strength that could fuel an unexpected comeback.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe SEC has delayed ETH ETF decision until May 23.\n\nETH\u2019s price has stabilized at $2,200, but another low looks likely.\n\nChart analysis points at a larger downtrend to $1,800.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Ethereum ETF, extending the timeline for wider investor access to Ethereum. A similar delay occurred with Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum ETF, with a decision now expected in early March.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Delays will continue to happen sporadically over the next few months. Next date that matters is May 23rd https://t.co/2zBBvHkrVk \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2024\n\nThis pattern mirrors delays with Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts anticipate sporadic postponements until late May, expecting a conclusive decision by May 23. The SEC\u2019s cautious stance on crypto is notable, but optimism about Ethereum\u2019s ETF approval remains.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of Ethereum has stabilized around $2,200 after its 20% downfall. It reverted to its previous low, which could indicate the start of a new downtrend. Can this stabilization lead to a recovery, or are we in for another low?\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nOn January 12, ETH reached a high of $2,710. This continued the coin\u2019s uptrend from a low of $1,513 on October 19. This uptrend was the ending wave of a much larger uptrend that started in June 2022.\n\nEthereum formed a rising channel, with the price interacting with resistance with on a recent high. This interaction resulted in a hard rejection. Today, January 25, ETH is trading at $2,200, near the last low from which this recent high was made.\n\nIn this way, the price action hints at a potential reversal as it whips out the gain previously made, indicating that sellers are taking control. If we saw a leading uptrend in a new bull cycle for Ethereum, now we could see its first bull market correction.\n\nThe last downtrend doesn\u2019t have much more room to go, but another minor low of $2,100 in the coming days looks likely. After a minor correction to the upside that will establish the first lower high for wave B, another, more significant downturn should take place at wave C.\n\nProjecting with the Fibonacci retracement tool at the 0.618 level, we come up with a target of $1,840 to complete this correction. After this correction ends and we see the first macro higher low, another lasting uptrend would be expected, ultimately bringing Ethereum\u2019s price to a new all-time high.\n\nDisclaimers\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "The cryptosphere is like an intricate chessboard; understanding the moves beneath the surface is key. Take the recent tumble of giants Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 a cautionary tale for investors blinded by hype and not fundamentals. Beneath the fad, attention is turning to Kelexo (KLXO), a DeFi upstart that\u2019s got analysts buzzing about 50x to 100x returns in its ongoing presale.\n\nKelexo (KLXO) Transforms Peer-to-Peer Lending, ICO Sees Wave of Signups\n\nOne thing about crypto: The noises are fads, but the blue-chip gems are the low-cap and ICO coins. As Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) fall, Kelexo (KLXO) has taken the spotlight, getting all the recognition it deserves for its novel peer-to-peer lending and borrowing protocol.\n\nThe project\u2019s mission to help the unbanked, revolutionize the lending process and provide passive income makes it a much-needed innovation. At its core, Kelexo (KLXO) will provide an enabling platform that connects borrowers with intending lenders with no strings attached. In other words, there will be no KYC, credit checks, or overwhelming paperwork.\n\nAs a result, smart investors are already cutting their losses and have aped into Kelexo\u2019s (KLXO) newly launched presale. The presale has seen tremendous growth already, trading at $0.022 with over 2,500 signups within 48 hours.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Faces Significant Selling Pressure\n\nThe ETF hype was a fad, and Ethereum (ETH) is still reeling in the aftermath of this reality. Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s robust smart contract compatibility has been one of its strongest strengths. However, a lack of ecosystem development and growing baseless hype have severely affected Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s value.\n\nOver the last week, Ethereum (ETH) traders realized nearly $33M in losses, the worst since October 13, 2023. Ethereum (ETH) price has declined by 14%, dropping to a psychological support level of $2,235 today. Sentiment is worsening, and analysts are pessimistic about Ethereum (ETH)\u2019s performance in the coming months.\n\nIs Bitcoin (BTC) ETF Another Sell-The-News?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has also followed Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) suit. Bitcoin (BTC)\u2019s decline surprised the general crypto market, especially with the positive outlook surrounding its spot ETF approval. Unfortunately, Bitcoin (BTC) has been in free fall, slumping under $39k and carving out all gains it accrued in the ETF, Ordinals, and pre-halving frenzy.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\u2019s value continues to nosedive. It was last seen at $39,600, about 20% from $49,000 earlier this month. The ETF craze blinded many investors. However, the smart ones were quick to realize that the innovative feature that Kelexo (KLXO) aims to provide far supersedes Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)\u2019s empty hype.\n\nConclusion\n\nNot all that glitters is gold! We\u2019ve seen that with Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)\u2019s surprising drop despite their fleeting buzz. However, Kelexo (KLXO) is poised to make a big splash in DeFi this year. It is definitely an ICO token to watch out for as big cryptos see outflow.\n\nFind out more about the Kelexo (KLXO) presale by visiting the website here\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Even as developers are observing Dencun in trials, they have also begun evaluating and prioritizing Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) for Electra, the next upgrade on the consensus layer.\n\nEthereum developers deliberated Thursday about the next consensus layer upgrade after the 2024 Dencun network hard fork.\n\nEven as developers are observing Dencun on a testing network, they have also begun evaluating and prioritizing Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) for Electra, the following upgrade on the consensus layer.\n\nDuring a live-streamed meeting that takes place every two weeks, developers touched on a range of topics that included potentially increasing the maximum number of ETH a validator can stake, addressing censorship in Ethereum\u2019s block production and scaling up data availability.\n\nDebating EIPs\n\nCurrently, the staking balance of a single Ethereum validator is 32 ETH, but Mike Neuder, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, is trying to create a range that would raise the limit on validators. His EIP-7251 aims to increase a validator\u2019s maximum balance 64 times to 2,048 ETH from 32 ETH.\n\n\u201cThe high-level reason for doing this EIP is to allow some consolidation of the total number of validators we have,\u201d Neuder said in today\u2019s consensus layer meeting, \u201cWe\u2019re currently at around 900,000.\u201d\n\nEthereum developers also discussed EIP-7594. It concerns peer-data availability sampling, which is a method to progress from EIP-4844 levels of scale \u201cwhere everyone\u2019s downloading blobs\u201d of data, to a level beyond that: \u201cCall it full danksharding,\u201d said Ethereum Foundation researcher Danny Ryan, who chairs the biweekly consensus meetings. (EIP-4844 is nicknamed \u201cProto-Danksharding\u201d after its two main authors.)\n\nDevelopers have not decided whether to prioritize EIP-7251 and EIP-7594 in Electra.\n\nAnother proposal, EIP-7547, was removed from consideration in the Electra upgrade. EIP-7547 aims to make Ethereum more censorship-resistant. Neuder, one of its authors, highlighted an Ethereum dashboard that showed the censorship of different operators in the block production pipeline. According to community resource website censorship.pics, builders censored about 67% of data blocks by excluding transactions from sanctioned crypto addresses.\n\nEIP-7547 entails a forced transaction inclusion mechanism that specifies what transactions must be included in blocks to be considered valid. \u201cThis is a relatively newer EIP, but I think the ideas are very well established and important for one of the core properties on Ethereum, which is censorship resistance,\u201d noted Neuter.\n\nGajinder Singh, maintainer of Ethereum clients Lodestar and EthereumJS, replied, \u201cWe support the EIP, but we don\u2019t feel strongly about it, because we feel that not all options have been exhausted.\u201d Ryan didn\u2019t get any volunteers when he asked if anyone wanted to make the case for EIP-7547\u2019s prioritization in Electra.\n\nDevelopers did agree to prioritize EIP-7002, which allows validators to trigger exits through their execution layer withdrawal credentials, according to the EIP\u2019s resource page. Ryan noted that EIP-7002 \u201cis relatively straightforward\u201d on both the consensus layer and execution layer. \u201cIt is a new operation type, but [it] triggers very well-known exit code paths,\u201d which refer to the different ways a validator can exit from its role in securing the Ethereum network.\n\nWhen Ryan asked in Monday\u2019s meeting whether anyone was against the inclusion of EIP-7002 in Electra, no one objected to it."

Tim Beiko, an Ethereum core developer, shared this on X.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Beiko, more testnet blobs are on their way, as Dencun will activate on the Sepolia testnet on Jan. 30 and the Holesky testnet on Feb. 7. He urges node operators on either network to update. Beiko further adds that, assuming both of these go smoothly, Ethereum Dencun will be scheduled on the Ethereum mainnet next.\n\nMore testnet blobs on the way .oO\n\n\n\nDencun will activate on Sepolia Jan 30, and on Holesky Feb 7.

The Sepolia and Holesky testnets will upgrade subsequently over the next two weeks. Dencun will activate on Sepolia at epoch 132608 on Jan. 30 at 10:51 p.m. UTC and on Holesky at epoch 29696 on Feb. 7 at 11:35 a.m. UTC.\n\nThe eagerly anticipated Dencun update follows last year's Shapella upgrade and includes changes to both Ethereum's consensus and execution layers.\n\nThe upgrade features several changes, the most notable of which is the implementation of ephemeral data blobs with EIP-4844, often known as \"protodanksharding,\" which will help cut L2 transaction fees.\n\nEthereum momentum to pick up in weeks\n\nMichael Van de Poppe, a crypto analyst, predicts that momentum for ETH might likely emerge in the coming weeks. He presents three arguments: Bitcoin's bottoming out could be a catalyst for altcoins to resume their upward trend. The second reason is the buzz around the Ethereum Spot ETF. Third, Ethereum plans to implement new upgrades that are anticipated to lower transaction fees by 90%.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, BTC perpetual swaps accounted for 55% of open interest in January 2022 and have subsequently increased to 66.2%. ETH's open interest dominance, however, fell from 45% to 33.8% between 2022 and 2024.\n\nBut following the ETF approval, ETH regained some market share, with its dominance increasing to more than 40% by this metric."

At the time of recording, Anatoly shared there were over 40,000 preorders.\n\nAnatoly and Jacquelyn discussed the long road to selling out Saga, how important rewards and developers are and the nitty-gritty details for Chapter 2. They also dove into the company\u2019s strategy and long-term mission of going up against Google and Apple app stores and how long it may take for Solana Mobile to break even.\n\nIf you need a refresher on Solana Mobile\u2019s Saga phone, we\u2019ve got you covered:\n\nSubscribe to Chain Reaction on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the latest episodes, and please leave us a review if you like what you hear!\n\nFollow the money\n\nPolymer Labs raises $23M to build out the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s interoperability Avalanche-based Masa raised $5.4M to build a \u201cpersonal data network\u201d Scene Infrastructure Company raised $3M from a16z to expand FWB token\u2019s utility Web3 gaming startup Arcade2Earn raised $4.8M in private token round Ingonyama raised $21 million to improve zero-knowledge technology\n\nThis list was compiled with information from Messari as well as TechCrunch\u2019s own reporting.\n\nWhat else we\u2019re writing\n\nWant to branch out from the world of web3?

        "content": "Mustafa has been writing about Blockchain and crypto since many years. He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nStory Highlights The SEC is considering approving a spot Ethereum ETF, but there are some challenges.\n\nSome experts are optimistic about the approval, while others are more cautious.\n\nThe SEC is expected to make a decision in May, but it could take longer.\n\nIn the wake of the recent green signal for 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, all eyes are now on the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. The burning question on everyone\u2019s minds is whether Ethereum will follow suit.\n\nThe journey towards approval, however, is riddled with challenges, primarily stemming from the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) unclear stance on how to classify Ethereum. The SEC is yet to make a definitive decision on whether Ethereum (ETH) falls within the purview of a security, creating a regulatory gray area that complicates the ETF approval process.\n\nStaying Optimistic Regardless\n\nDespite these regulatory hurdles, some optimists find solace in recent victories. Grayscale\u2019s Court of Appeals triumph and the green light for the Ethereum Futures ETF are seen as positive indicators. Optimists believe that an Ethereum ETF approval is imminent.\n\nIn the event of a potential SEC rejection in May, there is an anticipation of an appeal, with hopes that the SEC might reconsider to avoid complications.\n\nRead More: BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF: March 10th Deadline Could Be Make-or-Break!\n\nSo, What are the Odds of Approval?\n\nMarket experts offer varied perspectives on the likelihood of an Ethereum ETF approval. Brett Tejpaul, Coinbase Institutional\u2019s head, acknowledges growing interest but points out the SEC\u2019s reluctance to definitively label Ethereum as a security as a potential roadblock.\n\nEric Balchunas remains optimistic, assigning a 70% chance for approval, while James Seyffart adopts a more cautious estimate of 60-65%. Both experts weigh the positive and negative aspects, expressing relatively better odds for Ethereum compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said he expects a 70% chance of an Ethereum spot ETF being approved in May. The SEC needs to make approval decisions on multiple Ethereum spot ETF applications by the end of May, including VanEck, Ark 21Shares and Hashdex. Digital asset lawyer\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 11, 2024\n\nBitwise\u2019s Confidence\n\nBitwise, a company entrenched in Bitcoin ETFs, shares optimism about an Ethereum ETF. They highlight the necessary ingredients, including a robust market for Ethereum futures. However, the acknowledgment of Ethereum\u2019s complexity compared to Bitcoin introduces an element of uncertainty regarding the approval timeline.\n\nStaying Cautious is Key!\n\nSkeptics argue that the SEC\u2019s historical delays in approving cryptocurrency matters cast doubt on a swift approval for an Ethereum ETF. Given Ethereum\u2019s unique position, not fitting the traditional investment mold, gaining approval becomes a challenging feat.\n\nAlso Read: JP Morgan Says Spot Ethereum ETFs Approval Is Next \u2013 With 50% Chances\n\nJPMorgan analysts echo this skepticism, emphasizing the uncertainty surrounding the SEC\u2019s treatment of Ethereum as a regular commodity for the upcoming May approval. Adding a note of caution, investment bank TD Cowen suggests that the SEC might prefer observing the performance of Bitcoin ETFs before making decisions on other cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "BlackRock Ethereum ETF Joins the Wait as SEC Delays Decision - DailyCoin",
        "content": "The SEC has delayed its decision timeline for BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF proposal.\n\nThe commission previously delayed Fidelity Investment\u2019s proposal.\n\nInvestor optimism is fueled by the growing support for Ethereum from industry giants.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been abuzz with anticipation as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues its evaluation of over six Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) proposals. Issuers include investment management giants BlackRock, Ark Invest, Fidelity, and VanEck, hoping the commission will follow the precedent it set with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nYet, the SEC appears to be proceeding cautiously, consistently extending its decision deadlines. Following its pushback on Fidelity\u2019s application just a week ago, the SEC has extended the same fate to the next hopeful contender.\n\nSEC Delays BlackRock Ethereum ETF\n\nOn Wednesday, January 24, SEC Assistant Secretary Sherry Haywood announced the commission\u2019s decision to postpone BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF application deadline.\n\nThe proposal, filed on November 21, 2023, requests approval to list and trade BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust on the Nasdaq stock market.\n\nA 45-day timeframe has extended BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF deadline. The newly-scheduled date is March 10, 2024, by which the commission will either approve, reject, or institute additional proceedings to assess the proposal.\n\nCommenting on the delay, ETF Analyst James Seyffart asserted that the delays on ETF proposals will likely continue over the next months.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Delays will continue to happen sporadically over the next few months. Next date that matters is May 23rd https://t.co/2zBBvHkrVk \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2024\n\nThe speculation hinges on May 23, 2024, as the plausible date for the commission to roll out its verdict. Despite the speculation, the SEC has until August 7, 2024, to reach a final verdict on BlackRock\u2019s application.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision to delay the approval process has increased the growing anticipation for the regulator\u2019s stance on spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nExperts Bet on Ethereum ETF\n\nDespite predictions that Ethereum ETF delays are expected to continue, the open support by investors has charted an optimistic course for the potential approval of the financial instrument.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink\u2019s bullish endorsement of Ethereum as a \u201cstore\u201d of value has significantly boosted investor confidence in the asset\u2019s potential. Fellow spot Bitcoin ETF provider Valkyrie Investments has expressed interest in the Ethereum ecosystem, further solidifying the asset\u2019s hype.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF anticipation is not fueled by market sentiment alone, however. In a recent interview, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce voiced optimism about a balanced decision-making process for all proposals, which will adopt an \u201cinvestor-liberty\u201d approach.\n\nOther industry predictions affirm that the SEC will likely grant simultaneous approvals in May, similar to its approach with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nEthereum experienced a significant price boost upon the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBefore approving Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC expressed concerns about potential market manipulation, which may influence its current evaluation of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs will signal improved regulatory standards within the United States.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe SEC clarified that approving Bitcoin ETFs is not the endorsement of crypto assets, and the commission\u2019s decision to extend the evaluation period of proposals reflects its commitment to thorough consideration. While the unpredictable nature of the SEC makes predicting a verdict challenging, the final decision on Ethereum ETFs could be influenced by its current regulatory stance.\n\n\u200bRead more on the impressive performance of Ethereum this year:\n\nStrong Ethereum Fundamentals Fuel 20%+ Surge Against Bitcoin\n\n\n\nAre insider hacks becoming a thing among investors?

        "content": "Ethereum price managed to hold the $2,200 support as the crypto market downturn intensified this week, on-chain signals highlight rising whale demand.\n\nOn Jan. 22, the crypto market suffered significant bearish headwinds as Bitcoin (BTC) prices wobbled below $40,000 for the first time in 50 days. At press time on Jan. 25, the global crypto market capitalization has shrunk 7%, with $108.5 billion in valuation wiped out within the weekly timeframe.\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs. Crypto Market Cap Performance | Source: TradingView\n\nLosing 5% in Ethereum (ETH) price has maintained a relatively more resilient performance than the industry average between Jan. 22 and Jan. 24.\n\nEthereum whale activity remains high despite downtrend\n\nEthereum price has managed to keep losses below the 5% threshold this week, while Bitcoin and the global crypto market cap shrunk by up to 7%, respectively, before making a mild rebound. On-chain data trends suggest that the rising level of whale trading activity recorded on the Ethereum network this week has been pivotal to ETH\u2019s resilient price performance.\n\nSantiment\u2019s Whale transaction count metric tracks the daily number of transactions involving a particular cryptocurrency that exceeds $100,000.\n\nOn Jan. 23, the Ethereum Whale Transaction Count surged above 1,190. A closer look at the chart below shows this was the highest recorded since the ETH price raced to a 20-month peak of $2,690 on Jan. 11.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price vs. Whale Transaction Count | Source: Santiment\n\nCorporate entities accumulate ETH at significantly high volumes despite the broader market retreat. This could be attributed to investors and fund sponsors looking to acquire Ethereum ahead of a looming ETH spot ETF verdict.\n\nDuring market downtrends, an increase in whale transactions impacts the price of a crypto asset positively in two major ways. Firstly, it provides market liquidity, enabling bearish panic sellers to execute their trades at favorable prices. It also reinforces confidence among small-scale retail traders.\n\nThese factors have played a vital role as ETH battles to hold above the $2,200 support level amid market-wide sell-offs this week.\n\nEthereum investors opt for long-term storage\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum has also recorded a steady decline in exchange reserves this week, which could be linked to the rise in whale activity.\n\nCorporate entities and whales are known to be value investors who tend to hold for longer periods. Unsurprisingly, the rising volumes of whale transactions on the Ethereum network in recent months have coincided with a rapid decline in supply deposited on exchanges.\n\nAt the start of the week on Jan. 22, Ethereum supply on exchanges stood at 10.5 million ETH. But interestingly, that figure has dropped sharply to 10.4 ETH by Jan. 25.\n\nEffectively, this means that investors have shifted 150,000 ETH worth approximately $330 million from exchanges and trading platforms into long-term storage or staking contracts.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Supply on Exchanges vs. Price | Source: Santiment\n\nDespite bearish headwinds, Ethereum Supply on Exchanges dropped by 150,000 ETH in the last four days, signaling a dominant preference for long-term holding and passive income staking among current holders.\n\nNotably, Ethereum exchange supply has been in a downtrend since the Proof of Stake (PoS) transition in May 2023, a move that has coincided with an extended period of price uptrend.\n\nETH price prediction: Can Ethereum Price Stay Above $2,000?\n\nAs the downward trend in exchange supply persists, fewer ETH coins are readily available to be traded in spot markets. This appears to have decelerated the selling pressure on Ethereum this week relative to the broader altcoins market. Combined with the steady rise in whale transactions, Ethereum price is in a prime position to defend the $2,000 territory.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s in/out of the money around price data, which groups all existing ETH holders by their entry prices, also affirms this stance.\n\nIt shows that 8.3 million addresses, the largest cluster of ETH holders, had acquired 46.5 million ETH at the maximum price of $2,078. If Ethereum price slides toward $2,100, many of these holders could make frantic covering purchases to defend their positions to avoid slipping into net-loss positions. This could effectively trigger an instant Ethereum price rebound.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast, Jan 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nOn the upside, Ethereum bulls could overturn the bearish pressure if it reclaims the $2,500 territory. But this looks unlikely within the current market dynamics. As seen above, a significant cluster of 3.7 million addresses had acquired 7.1 million ETH at an average price of $2,400.\n\nIf they engage in mild profit-taking as prices hit their break-even point, Ethereum could slide into another correction phase.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Strong Support at This Crucial Level Paves the Way for Potential Upside - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) faced a turbulent start to the week, witnessing a further 3% decline in its value by Monday noon.\n\nNotably, the second-largest cryptocurrency has been on a downward spiral since mid-January, closely tied to the lacklustre response to the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETF applications, which has also caused a significant dip in Bitcoin\u2019s value by over 10%. Even the optimism surrounding a potential spot Ethereum ETF approval has failed to reverse the trend, particularly in light of the US SEC\u2019s recent decision to delay its verdict on the Fidelity Spot Ethereum ETF application.\n\nAs the crypto market experiences these fluctuations, analysts are closely examining Ethereum\u2019s potential moves, with the current price hovering around crucial make-or-break levels.\n\nIn a Monday Tweet, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Ethereum is currently situated in a key demand zone, spanning from $2,388 to $2,460, where approximately 1.02 million addresses previously purchased $4.82 million ETH ($11.6 Billion).\n\nHe further noted that the strength of this support zone could pave the way for minimal resistance, presenting a potential pathway for upward movement. However, the pundit warned of a potential pullback if Ethereum fails to sustain this level, suggesting the next significant support area lies around $2,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsewhere, popular crypto analyst and YouTuber \u201cAlan\u201d also shared insights with his 54,000 followers on Ethereum\u2019s current state, pointing out that Ethereum has touched its old resistance, which could turn into support if the price holds. Richard outlined two scenarios: a bullish pullback towards $3,000 or a potential re-entry into a range with a downward trend, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, not all analysts share the same optimism. \u201cCrypto H\u201d expressed a more bearish outlook, indicating that Ether\u2019s fair value gap has been filled, and there is no compelling reason for the price to move higher. According to him, Ether\u2019s chart suggests a potential downside with targets below the $2,400 support level.\n\n\u201cI am way more confident with taking short positions on ETH as there is little to no barrier for price to move lower and eventually make new lows $1500 and $1000 are the next targets I will be looking for.\u201d Wrote the pundit.\n\nThat said, despite Ether\u2019s price woes, the imminent deadline for the Spot Ethereum ETF, just four months away, is seen by some as a potential game-changer for mainstream adoption and institutional investment in ETH. Expectations for a bullish trend in 2024 are high, especially after Ethereum\u2019s recent outperformance compared to Bitcoin. Notably, despite a 15% drop in Bitcoin following its spot ETF approval, the ETH/BTC pair surged by 26% and has been holding firm.\n\nETH was trading at $2,221 at press time after a 2.98% drop over the past 24 hours."

Per the regulator, the proposed rule change which was published for comment in the Federal Register has received no feedback from the public to date.\n\nThe SEC noted that it needed additional time to deliberate on the application in order to make the right decision.\n\n\u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d the SEC wrote in the filing adding that in pursuant to its extant statutes, it now \u201cdesignates March 10, 2024, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.\u201d\n\nThis delay to BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF follows a related postponement of the application from rival Fidelity Investments. With the SEC liable for this postponement up to 240 days from the date of the first application, it is choosing to take its time appropriately.\n\nProspects of ETH ETFs\n\nThe emergence of spot Bitcoin ETF has heightened the optimism and the debate on the prospects of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States.\n\nAt the moment, there are divergent views on whether the markets regulator will greenlight this product but Commissioner Hester Peirce has reiterated how the agency has learned from past mistakes and will likely take a different path with the numerous Ethereum applications.\n\nWhile no one can say for sure the products will be approved, proponents believe a precedent has been set and with BlackRock in the race, the chances of securing the approvals are generally higher.\n\nBeyond spot Ethereum ETFs, speculations continue to grow that an XRP spot ETF might also be on the horizon."

        "content": "While Bitcoin has struggled since the much-anticipated spot ETFs have gone live, Ethereum has emerged as a winner in the sector.\n\nEthereum Has Done Better Against Both Bitcoin And Altcoins Recently\n\nIn its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed how Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the altcoins have performed against each other recently.\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector as a whole has enjoyed a net rise since BlackRock first filed for its exchange-traded fund (ETF) last year.\n\nThe trend in the market caps of the three asset classes over the past few months | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 4, 2024\n\nThis period was filled with speculation about whether the various spot ETFs would go through. Still, starting mid-October, the assets rose as confidence that approval would be achieved went up.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s market cap has increased by +68.8% since BlackRock first filed for their ETF, and the aggregate Altcoin Market Cap followed suit, rising by +68.9%,\u201d reads the report. \u201cHowever, Ethereum has seen more sluggish relative momentum, underperforming the wider altcoin space by -17%.\u201d\n\nNext, Glassnode has talked about the \u201cmarket cap dominance\u201d of these asset classes, which measures the percentage share they occupy in the total valuation of the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nThe trend in the market cap dominances of these assets over the last few years | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 4, 2024\n\nSince the FTX collapse in November 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap dominance has notably risen. However, BTC hasn\u2019t taken a share of Ethereum as the second-largest coin\u2019s dominance has moved mostly sideways in this period. Instead, the altcoins and stablecoins are the ones who have lost dominance to Bitcoin.\n\nThe BTC spot ETFs finally gained approval earlier this month, but the event turned out to be a sell-the-news one for the asset. In this post-ETF era, though, a new narrative has appeared in the sector in the form of the ETH spot ETFs.\n\n\u201cShortly after the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, several issuers have filed or suggested a willingness to advocate for a spot ETF for Ethereum,\u201d notes Glassnode. \u201cAlthough obtaining approval for an ETH-based ETF might be more challenging due to the SEC possibly considering Ether as more of an investment contract, the markets appeared to express optimism.\u201d\n\nAs the chart below shows, Ethereum\u2019s dominance against Bitcoin has gone up.\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have gone up for ETH recently | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 4, 2024\n\nAs the graph shows, ETH\u2019s market cap dominance versus BTC has increased by about 2.9% since the latter\u2019s spot ETFs gained approval from the US SEC.\n\nThe altcoin side of the sector has seen a net rise in this period as well, but the alts haven\u2019t been able to keep up with ETH, as the latter has generally outperformed them.\n\nETH has gained market-share against the altcoins | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 4, 2024\n\nIn total, Ethereum has earned 4.2% in global dominance. \u201cThis makes ETH the biggest winner in the post-ETF approval market movements,\u201d explains the analytics firm.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,230, up 1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nETH has plunged over the last couple of days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Bastian Riccardi on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nStory Highlights Only Bitcoin got ETF approval, dashing hopes for immediate Ethereum ETFs.\n\nSEC facing lawsuits from Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple while staying silent on the court cases.\n\nGarlinghouse criticizes the court-ordered path for Bitcoin ETFs, urging easier approval for future crypto ETFs.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, gary gensler gary gensler chairman at US Securities and Exchange Commision Gary Gensler is an enthusiastic leader and the current chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He has the extreme experience that spans wall street, government regulation, and an angel teaching about cryptocurrencies and blockchain at MIT. He announced several initiatives to enhance investor protections in the $2 trillion cryptocurrency market. He previously led the Biden-Harris transition\u2019s federal reserve, Banking, and securities regulation agency review team. He was awarded Treasury's highest honor, the Alexander Hamilton Award, and also was a recipient of the 2014 Frankel Fiduciary Prize. He was born on October 18, 1957, into a Jewish family, in Baltimore, Maryland. Graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, earning a Master's degree in Business Administration. Additionally, he is also a professor at the MIT Sloan School of management. He has served in various governmental roles since the 1990s, such as the treasury department, Sarbanes-Oxley, CFTC, Swaps, Enforcement, Libor investigation, Maryland Financial Consumer Protection Commission, Securities, and Exchange Commission. Gary Gensler will probably keep on filling in as seat of the SEC until 2026, accepting his renunciation. He has expressed his desires to present crypto-related approach changes later on that include token commitments, decentralized finance, stablecoins, guardianship, exchange-traded resources, and advancing stages. A few officials as well as his kindred SEC magistrates have scrutinized Gensler for not giving adequate administrative direction on crypto, possibly prompting a standoff between Congress and the association. The SEC, CFTC, and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network handle advanced resource guidelines in the U.S., however, each with various jurisdictional cases, bringing about an interwoven methodology that crypto firms should explore to work legitimately. Whether 2022 will see a more clear way for organizations in the crypto space is questionable, yet the cosmetics of the SEC's initiative will fundamentally change following the takeoff of chief Elad Roisman in the first month of the year. Chief Allison Lee's term is likewise set to terminate in June 2022. Chairman , recently clarified that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is limited to Bitcoin alone. Following the Bitcoin ETF approval, wild anticipations have arisen in hopes of spotting Ethereum ETFs. However, Gensler emphasized that the current focus is only on Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nNaturally, this has caused an uproar. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nGensler\u2019s Highlights\n\nGary Gensler emphasized that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs doesn\u2019t extend to the approval of other cryptocurrency ETFs like Ethereum. He affirmed that the improved disclosure and competition in the Bitcoin ETF market had benefited investors with lower fees.\n\n\u201cAs I said two weeks ago, what we did about bitcoin exchange-traded products is cabined to this one commodity non-security and shouldn\u2019t be read to be anything other than that.\u201d \u2026 \u201cYou\u2019ve seen some competition in which investors benefited from lower fees.\u201d\n\nAmidst the celebrations, the SEC finds itself entangled in legal battles with major crypto players like Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple. Gensler, maintaining a strategic silence, refrains from commenting on the ongoing court hearings involving these industry giants.\n\nTimeline Extended\n\nFollowing the media disclosure of Gensler, a court filing from the SEC on Wednesday announced the delay of its decision timeline on BlackRock\u2019s proposal for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund to March.\n\nThe filing revealed that the Nasdaq Stock Market filed a proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the iShares Ethereum Trust. For such a proposed rule change, the SEC is authorized to take 45-90 days to announce its decision.\n\nHence, because of this need for sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and related issues, the SEC has decided to extend the decision deadline to March 10, 2024.\n\nRead More About This: BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF: March 10th Deadline Could Be Make-or-Break!\n\nRipple CEO Speaks Out\n\nQuoting Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF comes with a mix of emotions, driven by the SEC\u2019s need for a court intervention. Garlinghouse warns against a repetitive journey for every ETF, highlighting the potential challenges.\n\n\u201cThe sad part of that reality is we have a Bitcoin ETF only because a US court said to the SEC \u201cYou\u2019re being arbitrary and capricious in your apply of your application of the law\u201d\u2026 What would be sad is if every ETF had to go through that same journey.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock Decides to Stay Away from XRP ETFs; Here\u2019s Why"

        "content": "A recent announcement from Ethereum core developers suggests that the Dencun upgrade is still on schedule.\n\nThe stance comes despite challenges experienced in the network\u2019s first outing on Goerli.\n\nThe disclosure strengthens expectations of a Q1 2024 Dencun mainnet release.\n\nFor members of the Ethereum community, 2024 promises to be an exciting year. One of the reasons for this excitement is the expected rollout of the long-anticipated Dencun upgrade, which would introduce proto-danksharding, also known as EIP-4844, marking the first step in a multi-year vision to address Ethereum\u2019s scaling challenges.\n\nOn January 17, the Dencun upgrade finally made it to an Ethereum testnet after nearly a year of anticipation, with developers and enthusiasts hoping for a Q1 2024 mainnet release. However, bugs and challenges experienced during this testnet release had sparked concerns of further delays. These concerns have now been put to rest by a recent Ethereum Protocol Support team announcement.\n\nEthereum Dencun Still on Track\n\nIn December 2023, Ethereum core developers rolled out tentative dates for the Dencun upgrade to launch on Ethereum\u2019s testnets. In line with this schedule, developers rolled out the Dencun upgrade on Goerli, Ethereum\u2019s soon-to-be deprecated testnet for staking infrastructure and protocol level changes, on January 17. But amid a launch marred by bugs and challenges, there had been questions about how the schedule could be impacted.\n\nIn a Wednesday, January 24 announcement, however, developers have suggested that there would be no change to the Dencun upgrade schedule. The announcement confirmed that upgrades on Sepolia, Ethereum\u2019s sandbox for testing DApps, smart contract, and EVM functionality, and Holesky, Goerli\u2019s planned replacement, would occur as scheduled on January 30 and February 7, respectively.\n\nMore testnet blobs on the way .oO\n\n\n\nDencun will activate on Sepolia Jan 30, and on Holesky Feb 7. If running a node on either network, now's the time to update it!\n\n\n\nAssuming both of these go smoothly, mainnet is next \u2705https://t.co/QbEUACix2S \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 25, 2024\n\nTo this end, developers have urged validators to upgrade to Dencun-supported clients on Sepolia and Holesky to ensure a smooth upgrade experience. Developers also highlighted the risks of choosing majority clients amid recent client centralization debates within the Ethereum community. The discussion has sparked fear of a single bug, causing users to lose their stake through a chain split.\n\nDencun\u2019s Rocky Start on Goerli\n\nMultiple issues plagued Dencun\u2019s first testnet outing, including a failure to achieve finality and a chain split. Developers attributed the former to low network participation from validators, while the latter was attributed to a bug in Prysm nodes. These issues were, however, resolved in a few hours as developers confirmed that the network was finalizing again.\n\nFinality is the guarantee that crypto transactions cannot be reversed once they are executed.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nUnforeseen challenges on Sepolia and Holesky could still impact the Dencun launch timeline.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 chains will benefit the most from proto-danksharding, which promises to cut fees for end users by shaving the cost of data storage on the mainnet.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is a long-anticipated upgrade that promises to bring Ethereum one step closer to solving scaling concerns. The recent announcement from developers suggests that the upgrade is still on track to launch in Q1 2024.\n\nRead this for more on Dencun\u2019s first outing woes:\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade Hits Snags in First Testnet Outing\n\n\n\nPolygon\u2019s interoperability layer is coming.

        "content": "The SEC chair said that the Bitcoin ETF approval stays limited to one commodity, hinting that the agency isn\u2019t thinking of approving an Ethereum ETF. Also, the agency delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nDuring a media briefing on Wednesday, January 24, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this month remains limited to this single cryptocurrency and one shouldn\u2019t interpret it to have any broader implications beyond it. Gensler\u2019s comments come at a time when top financial players including BlackRock and Fidelity have been pushing for a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn his briefing yesterday, the SEC chair said:\n\n\u201cAs I said two weeks ago, that which we did with regard to bitcoin exchange traded products is cabined to this one commodity non-security and shouldn\u2019t be read to be anything other than that.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, crypto experts remain confident that a spot Ethereum ETF could be coming this year. Previously, some analysts have stated that the approval could come by May 2024.\n\nAdditionally, on Wednesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission delayed the decision for BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF proposal, pushing the deadline to March 10. Until then, the regulatory body has time to make a decision. The SEC can either approve, disapprove, or initiate further proceedings on the proposed fund. The filing from the SEC reads:\n\n\u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.\u201d\n\nBlackRock submitted the proposal for its spot Ethereum ETF last year in November 2023. Additionally, Fidelity\u2019s application for the spot Ethereum ETF is also facing delays, as filed by the SEC last week.\n\nSEC\u2019s Legal Battles\n\nThe US SEC remains embroiled in legal battles with multiple crypto firms including top names like Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple.\n\nIn June, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance Holdings and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao, alleging deceptive practices towards customers, failure to restrict US investors, channeling funds to investment funds owned by Zhao, and unregistered exchange operations. The SEC also identified 12 tokens, including BNB and BUSD, as securities.\n\nSimilarly, Coinbase faced an SEC lawsuit in June, accused of operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency. When questioned about recent court hearings, SEC Chair Gensler deferred to the agency\u2019s enforcement staff and litigators for specific details.\n\n\u201cBut stepping back from any one case, I just think that the investing public, if they\u2019re interested in investing in crypto securities, they should be aware and careful that these crypto security tokens are not necessarily giving them the appropriate disclosures and they\u2019re not getting those disclosures from these non-compliant token operators,\u201d said Gensler."

        "content": "Thu 25 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nBlackRock, the financial giant, unveils its ambitions with an application for a spot Ethereum ETF. However, the US SEC is playing for time, pushing the decision to March. Larry Fink, confident, aims for approval, but Gary Gensler, head of the SEC, leaves doubt hanging in the air. Between hopes and uncertainties, the crypto world is holding its breath.\n\nA Spot Ethereum ETF in March, really?\n\nFollowing the dance of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, BlackRock now wants to take Ethereum spot trading for a spin. Larry Fink, the maestro at BlackRock, firmly believes in his ETH Spot ETF, already approved on January 10 alongside a myriad of other products. A vivid wish that, according to him, will rocket ETH into the stars of institutional finance.\n\nBut the SEC is not ready to be easily swept away by these ETH Spot ETFs.\n\nThe U.S. SEC has pushed back the timetable for a decision on BlackRock\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF until March. The SEC now faces a March 10 deadline to approve, reject or take additional proceedings against the proposed fund. The next important date to watch is May 23,\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 25, 2024\n\n\u201cThe US SEC has postponed the timeline for the decision on BlackRock\u2019s proposed Spot Ethereum ETF to March. The SEC now has until March 10 to approve, reject, or initiate further proceedings against the proposed fund. The next important date to watch is May 23, according to James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg.\u201c\n\nAccording to The Block, the SEC has announced that it will not make any decisions on these spot Ethereum ETFs before March. March 10th could be the day when the SEC, with its regulatory broom, will sweep through the approval requests from BlackRock, ARK 21 Shares, VanEck, and Fidelity.\n\nAs usual, Bloomberg\u2019s keen financial analyst, James Seyffart, has looked into his crystal ball regarding the Ethereum ETFs. Predicting their validation in May, he left this gem on his account X:\n\n\u201cThe delays of the Spot Ethereum ETFs will continue to occur sporadically over the coming months. The next date that counts is May 23\u201c\n\nGary Gensler, the SEC\u2019s dance master, has his say!\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs are stirring up passions among analysts: between those who already see the SEC saying \u201cyes\u201d to an ETH waltz and the skeptics who rather hear a resounding \u201cno.\u201d\n\nGary Gensler, the current conductor of the SEC, has already suggested that for spot trackers linked to assets other than Bitcoin, the music might not play in their favor.\n\n\u201cAs I mentioned two weeks ago, our playbook for exchange-traded products linked to Bitcoin is confined to this product in particular. There\u2019s no need to read anything more into it\u201c, he stated on Wednesday.\n\nFor the record, BlackRock\u2019s application for a Spot Ethereum ETF was filed in November 2023.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

For BTC, with a put/call ratio of 0.52 and a defined \u2018max pain point\u2019 at $41,000, there lies significant open interest of over $360 million at a strike price of $50,000.\n\nThe ETH options highlight a different scenario, evidenced by a lower put/call ratio of 0.31 and a \u2018max pain point of $2,300. There is also significant open interest of around $200 million at the price of $2400.\n\nSuch figures foretell potential fluctuation in the digital asset market following the options expiration at 8:00 AM UTC, Jan. 26."

        "content": "Celsius has sent more Ethereum (ETH) to Coinbase.\n\nThe bankrupt crypto lender may not sell all its exchange deposits despite fears.\n\nThe moves come as Celsius is expected to launch asset distribution to customers and creditors soon.\n\nDespite the recent crypto market recovery recorded in 2023, the unwinding of assets tied to crypto firms that went under in the 2022 bear market has continued to loom large over the market.\n\nIn November 2023, Celsius, one of the bankrupt firms, gained approval to proceed with restructuring plans that required a $75 million wind-down budget and about $225 million in fiat to capitalize a new creditor-owned mining firm. Following the plan\u2019s approval, crypto market participants braced for the selling pressure, anticipating massive sell-offs in Ethereum (ETH), the firm\u2019s most significant holding, amid efforts to raise the capital.\n\nBeyond the $300 million mark, however, the firm\u2019s ETH exchange deposits have not slowed down, sparking further concern about a continued sell-off.\n\nCelsius Strikes Again?\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Celsius has moved another 18,000 ETH worth approximately $40 million to Coinbase, bringing its total ETH transfer to exchanges, including FalconX and OKX, since the approval of its restructuring plan near 281,000 ETH (about $621 million), twice the selling volume most market participants anticipated.\n\nWith the firm holding at least 550,000 ETH worth over $1.2 billion at current rates, according to Arkham Intelligence data at the time of writing, market participants are understandably concerned.\n\nIs Celsius Network Selling All Its Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nDespite the concerns, Celsius is unlikely to sell all its ETH as some fear. Per the firm\u2019s recently approved restructuring plan, it is committed to settling most creditor claims, including an estimated $2.1 billion allocation to retail customers, with a mix of liquid crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC), ETH, and Tether (USDT).\n\nContrary to the broad market perception, in line with this plan, Celsius may not be selling all of its exchange deposits, particularly its Coinbase deposits, since January 5. At the time, the bankrupt lender noted that it would be unstaking ETH to ensure timely distribution. The firm\u2019s restructuring plan names Coinbase as a distribution partner.\n\nWhen Will Distribution Start?\n\nWhile Celsius\u2019 restructuring plan intends to see the firm exit bankruptcy by Q1 2024, it is unclear when it will start distributing assets to creditors and customers. However, some speculate that it could begin as early as the end of January 2024.\n\ncelsius distributions planned for jan 31 also \u2014 Fabian D. (@_FabianHD) January 16, 2024\n\nAt its peak, Celsius was a leading crypto lender valued at over $3 billion. However, following the crypto market collapse hastened by the Terra Luna crash, the firm was revealed to be \u201cdeeply insolvent\u201d amid shady finance and risk management practices. At the time, the firm had 600,000 customers who held about $4.4 billion in assets on the platform.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nFormer Celsius customers have expressed concerns about the capabilities of US Bitcoin, the firm assigned to manage the new creditor-owned Bitcoin mining firm. The concerns come as some argue that the firm is presently in a weakened financial position.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nCelsius\u2019 continuous Ethereum exchange deposits have sparked concerns of significant selling pressure on the asset among investors.\n\nRead this for more on Celsius\u2019 Ethereum transfers:\n\nCelsius Network Moves ETH Worth $125M: Is a Sell-off Looming?\n\n\n\nFind out what Chainlink Automation brings to Base:\n\nHere\u2019s What Chainlink Automation Brings to Coinbase\u2019s Base"

It is duly denoted with the EIP-7569 tag, and the \u2018proto-danksharding\u2019 feature is only one of the offerings.\n\nOnce they hit the public Ethereum blockchain, data blobs are expected to be more storage efficient and radically reduce layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions\u2019 rollup costs and transaction fees.\n\nCurrently, the Dencun hard fork is being battle-tested on the Goerli testnet after making its official launch on January 17.\n\nOn January 30, it would migrate to the Sepolia testnet and make its final stand on Holesky on February 7.

The first epoch confirming its slot succession will kick in at 4243456.\n\nOn the other hand, Holesky\u2019s launch is scheduled for 11:34:24 at the epoch height of 29696, with its first epoch slot going online at 950272.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade follows in the footsteps of the Shapella upgrade, which activated staking on the Beacon Chain after the Ethereum blockchain switched to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.\n\nSimilar to Shapella, Dencun introduces nine features, including transient storage opcodes (EIP-1153), Beacon block root in the EVM (EIP-4788), shard blob transactions (EIP-4844), and six others.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Approval Delayed\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum network is the second most valuable blockchain-based protocol after the Bitcoin network.\n\nControlling as much as 19% of the emerging industry, Ethereum is home to everything powered by smart contracts, including decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Metaverse, and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nWith so many use cases, the protocol has garnered comparable or even lesser recognition than the Bitcoin network, with several legacy-backed asset management firms looking to offer exchange-traded fund (ETF) products underlying the network.\n\nOne such entity is Grayscale Asset Management, which has recently encountered a delay from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nAnd another one \u2026 @SECGov delays @Grayscale Spot Ethereum ETF application.

This is the first of many delays the agency can exercise within a 240-day period. The SEC\u2019s next deadline to approve, disapprove, or further delay the BlackRock spot ETH ETF decision is on March 10.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest fund manager with over $9 trillion in assets under management, applied for a spot ether ETF in November 2023. After the approval of nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan 10, BlackRock boss Larry Fink said he\u2019s all in on a spot ETH ETF in a CNBC interview, adding that the introduction of such funds \u201care just stepping stones towards tokenization.\u201d\n\nOther prominent companies such as Ark Invest, VanEck, Fidelity, and Grayscale are also seeking to launch their own Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNext date that matters is May 23rd,\u201d said Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart on Jan. 24, further noting that he expects more spot Ether ETF delays \u201csporadically\u201d in the coming months.\n\nWill Spot Ether ETFs Need Lawsuits And Appeals To Be Approved?\n\nStrategists have forecasted that ETH ETF applications will be successful, as the legal realities that pushed the SEC to give the nod to Bitcoin ETFs reluctantly will likely also apply to ether.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester \u201cCrypto Mom\u201d Peirce recently suggested that a drawn-out court battle won\u2019t be necessary to convince the Commission to approve spot Ether applications.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 in order for us to get it right,\u201d Peirce told a Coinage interviewer, referencing the landmark Grayscale court ruling that preceded the greenlighting of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.\n\nIf approved, it would be the first time professional American investors can gain exposure to the industry\u2019s second-largest crypto by market cap, ether.\n\nSpot ETH ETFs would further legitimize Ethereum\u2019s status in mainstream finance, leading to intensified interest and investment in ether-based projects."
