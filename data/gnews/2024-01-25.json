        "content": "Coinbase's Layer-2 Struggles, Polygon Closes In on Ethereum's User Growth\n\nCoinbase's layer-2 scaling solution, Base, has struggled to gain traction, acquiring under 2 million users since its launch, according to a report by Flipside Crypto. This pales in comparison to Polygon's meteoric rise \u2013 it onboarded over 15 million new users last year, almost rivaling Ethereum's growth.\n\nEthereum still led overall with 15.4 million new users in 2023. But Polygon followed closely behind with 15.2 million, despite being a layer-2 network built on Ethereum.\n\nIn contrast, Base saw an initial spike of enthusiasm fizzle out into sluggish adoption. On the bright side, it now faces competition from alternative layer-2s with more mature ecosystems like Arbitrum (7.3 million 2023 users).\n\nAs one of Ethereum's most prominent scaling solutions, Polygon's explosive user growth demonstrates the immense potential of layer-2 technology. By delivering faster and cheaper transactions, it serves as a blueprint for how Base could also take advantage of Ethereum's mainstream adoption.\n\nBut Polygon had a multi-year head start in building its developer ecosystem compared to the Base network."

        "content": "Ethereum Scaling Protocol AltLayer Airdrops $100M Worth of Tokens\n\nAltLayer, a decentralized protocol that enables Ethereum developers to deploy rollups and other scaling solutions, has launched its ALT airdrop, distributing tokens worth over $100 million to eligible community members.\n\nAltLayer is compatible with existing scaling networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. In addition to its open protocol, AltLayer offers a \"rollups-as-a-service\" feature for custom-building scaling integrations.\n\nWith 300 million ALT tokens made available in this initial drop, the total value of the AltLayer airdrop stands at just under $100 million. Users that are eligible to claim the airdrop includes AltLayer OG Badge NFT holder, Oh Ottie! NFT holder, participants of AltLayer\u2019s Altitude campaigns, EigenLayer restakers and Celestia stakers. Approximately 500,000 wallets are eligible for the airdrop. The ALT airdrop claim will remain open until February 25, after which any unclaimed tokens will be sent to the AltLayer treasury.\n\nThe ALT token was launched via Binance Launchpool, which opened farming from January 19 to January 25. ALT began trading on Thursday, and has already gained 11.7%, reaching its current price of $0.3126. It also saw substantial trading volumes of over $652 million, making it the 10th most traded token over the past 24 hours.\n\nAltLayer's airdrop comes amid a resurgence of airdrops in recent months, fueled by a market wide rally in the last quarter of 2023. Notable recent airdrops include Solana's Jito Protocol, Pyth Network and Manta Network."
