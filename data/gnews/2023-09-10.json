        "content": "In the lead up to the countdown to Bitcoin Halving in the second quarter of 2024, it would be interesting to view the Ethereum price forecast, considering that the momentum carried by the second largest cryptocurrency could have a spillover effect on the rest of the crypto market.\n\nAlso Read: Tucker Carlson Gives Bitcoin Big Win Before Javier Milei Interview\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin Halving \u2013 Not So Good For ETH?\n\nPrior to the Bitcoin Halving event in May 2020, the ETH price failed to gain momentum and only maintained lower highs, until it saw a higher high just around the Halving. Hence, analyst Benjamin Cowen has asserted that the second half of the pre-Halving year is likely not going to be favorable to Ethereum. Cowen predicted that the general direction should be down overall in the lead up to the event, although the cryptocurrency may likely see some upside during the time.\n\nThe analyst predicted that ETH could close the year 2023 below the yearly open of $1,195. Going by the analyst forecast, the ETH price may likely decline to below $1,400 by the end of October 2023. Does it mean that the cryptocurrency would stay around the same level more or less until the Bitcoin Halving? Despite the high volatility, since the last quarter of 2021, Ethereum had been mostly maintaining a share of just under 20% of the total crypto market capitalization.\n\nIn other news, CoinGape reported that the Twitter account belonging to Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin has been hacked.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Co-founder Vitalik Buterin Twitter Account Hacked"

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, allegedly had his X (formerly Twitter) account compromised. According to prominent blockchain investigator ZachXBT, the incident has led to victims collectively losing over $691,000 after clicking on a malicious link.\n\nIn a Sept. 9 post on X, Dmitry Buterin, the father of Vitalik, announced that his son\u2019s account had been compromised:\n\n\u201cDisregard this post, apparently Vitalik has been hacked. He is working on restoring access.\u201d\n\nThe post he was referring to has since been deleted. It was published on Buterin\u2019s account, claiming to celebrate the arrival of \u201cProto-Danksharding coming to Ethereum.\u201c\n\nThe hacker shared a malicious link to an alleged free commemorative nonfungible token (NFT) available, enticing victims to connect their wallets before ultimately stealing all their funds.\n\nConsequently, this incident has led Ethereum developer Bok Khoo, better known as Bokky Poobah on X, to claim he has suffered losses in his CryptoPunk NFT collection.\n\nWARNING!

        "content": "The Ethereum price has maintained its position above the $1,600 mark, along with the ascending support trendlines for the past three weeks. Frequent dips to this level, swiftly met with buying interest, underscore the resolve of buyers to hold the fort. However, is this fortified support enough to usher in a bullish turnaround?\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Discussions Spikes Amidst Spot ETF Filings, Is ETH Price Aiming Bulls?\n\nadvertisement\n\n$1600 Support Prevents ETH Price From Major Fall\n\nThe Ethereum chart continues to present demand pressure at the $1600 mark.\n\nA breakout above the overhead trendline will offer better confirmation of recovery\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $2.4 Billion, indicating a 14.5% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nOn August 29, the Ethereum coin saw a dash of optimism as buyers propelled the price to $1,744. This move aimed to rekindle bullish hope among investors. Yet, this was short-lived, as prices swiftly retraced to the familiar territory of $1,600.\n\nAmidst the prevailing market uncertainty, ETH price presently stands at $1,620, showing a minor intraday loss of 0.77%. Notably, sellers made an attempt to pierce through the bottom trendline today.\n\nBut all is not bleak. Should buyers retain control and defend this crucial level, there\u2019s a potential bullish reversal on the horizon. Such a move would directly challenge the descending resistance trendline that has been the bane for ETH price over the past couple of months.\n\nA successful break above this could signal a broader recovery, possibly driving altcoin towards $1,875.\n\nWill Ethereum Plunge to $1500?\n\nIt should be noted that the inability of buyers to mount a substantial recovery, despite numerous bounce-backs from the bottom trendline, suggests tepid bullish confidence. This could be a harbinger of a more prolonged downturn. If the coin price dips below the support trendline and with a daily candle closing beneath it, it could spell a bearish continuation, potentially dragging Ether down to the $1,500 level. The long-term support trend hovering above this support could offer a major dip opportunity for traders\n\nExponential Moving Average: The 100-and-200-day EMA slope nearing a bearish crossover could intensify supply pressure in the market.\n\nRelative Strength Index: The daily RSI slope must rise above the 40% market to enter sufficient momentum of bullish reversal."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s TVL continued bleeding as the market extended its uncertainty.\n\nETH\u2019s ecosystem maintained some health and top whales have been buying the dip.\n\nThe crypto market just concluded another one of its most dormant weeks so far in 2023. Ethereum [ETH] and other top networks have experienced a significant slowdown in activity as is usually the case under such circumstances.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThe impact of the current market conditions was evident in multiple facets of the Ethereum network. This includes its TVL, which was a long way from its historic high. It had a total value locked of $21.42 billion at the time of writing, which is a stark contrast compared to its historic peak above $108 billion in 2021.\n\nDespite the slightly improved conditions so far this year, the market is still in a state of caution. As such, we have seen significant outflows in TVL since April. An indication that investor confidence in ETH\u2019s bullish potential is not there yet.\n\nRegardless of the slow and negative TVL growth in the last few months, there are some areas in ETH\u2019s journey this year that inspire some more confidence. For example, Ethereum\u2019s total value locked in ETH deposit contracts just achieved a new historic peak at over 28.7 million ETH.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Total Value in the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract just reached an ATH of 28,734,846 ETH View metric:https://t.co/SzbMPqvhlb pic.twitter.com/eiDkE5DVw4 \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) September 9, 2023\n\nThe total value locked also confirms that Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem is still experiencing healthy network activity. But how is ETH fairing especially as the market appears to be stuck in limbo?\n\nETH supply distribution reveals something interesting about whale activity\n\nNow that ETH\u2019s total value is up, let\u2019s take a look at what has been happening with whale activity. According to its supply distribution metric, addresses holding over 10 million ETH (denoted in red) have been accumulating in the last 4 weeks. This category controls the largest share of ETH\u2019s circulating supply at 23.55%.\n\nAddresses in the 10,000 to 100,000 ETH category have also been accumulating ETH since the start of September. However, the other top whale categories have been contributing some sell pressure which may explain why the sell pressure has been canceling out the prevailing demand.\n\nRead about ETH\u2019s price prediction for 2024\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for ETH?\n\nETH\u2019s price action has been stuck at its current support level since the start of September. It exchanged hands at $1,633 at press time.\n\nETH\u2019s money flow indicator already shows that liquidity has been flowing into ETH. In other words, there has been some accumulation within the current support zone, highlighting the gradual return of optimism. However, caution is still warranted since the market is not out of the woods yet."

        "title": "1 Year Later, What Have We Learned From Ethereum and The Merge? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "On Sept. 15, Ethereum (ETH -1.02%) will celebrate the one-year anniversary of The Merge -- a technological tour de force that was easily one of the most hyped and anticipated events of 2022 for the crypto market. One year ago, investors salivated at the thought of what impact The Merge might have on Ethereum's future price.\n\nBut guess what? Ethereum is still trading under $1,650, at almost exactly the same price that it was 12 months ago. This raises an interesting question: What exactly have we learned from Ethereum and The Merge? And how can those lessons be applied when evaluating other cryptocurrencies? Let's take a closer look.\n\nTech upgrades\n\nPerhaps the biggest lesson here is that tech upgrades, no matter how big, do not always lead to huge price increases. This is an important point to keep in mind, based on how much hype many of these tech upgrades get. They are usually presented as major catalysts capable of sending a crypto soaring. But the truth might be quite different.\n\nWhat's interesting in the case of Ethereum is that The Merge was a truly transformational change and theoretically should have had a dramatic impact on Ethereum's price. The Merge transformed Ethereum from an old, energy-intensive, proof-of-work blockchain into a modern, energy-efficient, proof-of-stake blockchain. So, The Merge was a very different type of event than a typical annual upgrade that many blockchains undergo, and yet it still didn't have an appreciable impact on Ethereum's price.\n\nFrom my perspective, it means that the \"tech upgrade = growth catalyst\" investment thesis is no longer useful for evaluating cryptocurrencies. Going forward, you can pretty much assume that either the market is going to price in these upgrades as they are announced or the market is going to ignore the upgrade entirely. So, trying to time your investment decisions around key upgrades is not likely to be an effective strategy.\n\nRegulatory risk\n\nThe second big lesson from The Merge is that new business models can lead to new regulatory headaches. As soon as Ethereum became a proof-of-stake blockchain, it meant that there was going to be much more of a focus on crypto staking, which is the process of \"locking up\" your crypto in exchange for a financial reward. Until The Merge, crypto staking was a sleepy backwater of the crypto industry. But after The Merge, everyone was trying to figure out how to capture those financial rewards.\n\nAnd that included, unfortunately, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). From the perspective of SEC chairman Gary Gensler, new crypto-staking products sounded a lot like securities, and he vowed to take a closer look. In February, the SEC ended up going after cryptocurrency exchange Kraken for its crypto-staking activities, and that immediately got the attention of the market. Right now, Coinbase Global (COIN 1.38%) is locked in an epic battle with the SEC over the future of crypto staking.\n\nIf you parse through all the filings, documents, and back-and-forth between market participants and regulatory authorities, it sounds a lot like the SEC is not so much opposed to the concept of staking as it is to the way staking is marketed to retail investors, who might think it's a no-brainer, no-risk guaranteed return of some kind. But still, if you're an investor in Ethereum, you have to be aware that some regulatory risk does exist here, and it was all brought about by a change in business model (i.e., the shift from mining to staking).\n\nMacroeconomic outlook\n\nThe third big lesson is that the macroeconomic outlook matters more for crypto than many of us would like to admit. Gone are the days when the crypto market was completely separate from traditional, mainstream financial markets. With a surge of new institutional money into crypto comes a surge of institutional thinking about the crypto market. And that means a 24/7 obsession with the macroeconomic outlook.\n\nThus, while 2023 should have been all about the new era of Ethereum 2.0, it has instead been all about regional bank crises, Federal Reserve policy, jobs data, and inflation data. Long story short, there is absolutely no way Ethereum is going to skyrocket in price if banks are failing, inflation is surging, and economic growth is anemic. This completely changes the game for many crypto investors, who need to take a much more holistic view of the financial markets into account when choosing where to invest.\n\nA framework for analyzing cryptocurrencies\n\nTaken together, these three lessons can offer the basic framework for evaluating just about any cryptocurrency. First, make sure you understand the underlying business model of a crypto. Next, layer in some macroeconomic analysis, with a focus on key events or metrics that are being watched by the biggest institutional investors. And only then can you start to focus on all the interesting features of a new tech upgrade. In short, the tech upgrade is just the cherry on top of the final dessert, not the main course.\n\nAnd Ethereum? I'm still bullish on this crypto, even if it hasn't taken off the way it was supposed to one year ago. It's still up 35% for the year, and recent developments seem to suggest that institutional investors are adding to their Ethereum positions. But I'm not trying to time the market around new tech upgrades. Instead, I'm investing in Ethereum because I have confidence in its long-term growth prospects."
