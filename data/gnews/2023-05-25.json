        "title": "What Happens to Bitcoin and Ethereum If the US Defaults on Its Debt? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe United States is barreling toward a date that could have historic consequences for global markets, running the risk of its first-ever debt default. It's a potential black swan event that could have an outsized impact on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the rest of the crypto market.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned weeks ago that the government would soon run out of funds if the debt ceiling isn\u2019t suspended or raised\u2014possibly as early as June 1. If lawmakers remain deadlocked and can\u2019t come to an agreement on spending, Washington won\u2019t be able to pay its bills, she said.\n\nSimilar standoffs over the debt ceiling have rattled markets in the past, like a prolonged disagreement over the debt ceiling that sent the S&P 500 tumbling 16% in 2011, startling investors before a resolution was reached.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis time around, Wall Street has yawned. The S&P 500 is down less than 1% since Yellen issued her sobering remarks on May 1. However, Bitcoin has fallen more than 7% and Ethereum is down nearly 3% during the same period, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAmerica's \u201cX-date\u201d\n\nTypically, debt ceiling debacles create more noise than market-moving news, Amberdata\u2019s Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt\u2014but he acknowledged that a U.S. debt default is far from off the table.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a pretty intense game of chicken right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd given how crazy things have gone in the past couple of years, I think anything is possible.\u201d\n\nIn the event that the government defaults on its debts, risk assets like stocks and crypto would face short-term pain, Magadini said. He explained that\u2019s because a drop in the quality of government-backed debt would likely raise borrowing costs, counterintuitively increasing its yield and strengthening the dollar compared to other assets.\n\nSimilarly, the dollar could strengthen during a U.S. default as American traders tend to onshore their dollars\u2014swapping foreign currencies and assets for the greenback\u2014during risk-off events, CoinShares\u2019 Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTechnically speaking, the dollar should sell off in the event of a default, but it won't because people tend to onshore their dollars in periods of market stress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dollar might actually strengthen, perversely, because people are getting worried, and that actually won\u2019t be so great for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nButterfill envisions the dollar will strengthen and Bitcoin will slide as the U.S. approaches what the White House has described as America's \u201cX-date,\u201d the official date at which the government can no longer pay its bills.\n\n\u201cThis is a really complicated scenario,\u201d Butterfill said, noting he doesn\u2019t think a default is likely. \u201cIt\u2019s not that obvious what exactly will happen.\u201d\n\nBitcoin May Bounce\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum could react differently in the event of a default, Amberdata\u2019s Magadini said. Bitcoin may bounce alongside gold after an initial slide\u2014as a check on government-issued currency\u2014while Ethereum would likely remain depressed alongside tech stocks, he said.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by Genesis\u2019 Co-Head of Trading Gordon Grant, who told Decrypt that Bitcoin has more upside than Ethereum if the government can no longer meet its debt obligations, but both coins would face pressure initially.\n\n\u201cMaybe there's an initial wick down, as risk assets get absolutely trounced, because the stock market is going to get decimated,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Bitcoin is probably going higher.\u201d\n\nFor Ethereum, Grant said that the second largest crypto by market cap is often tied to indexes tracking tech stocks like the NASDAQ, making it likely to underperform compared to Bitcoin if a default takes place.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't matter whether I think that that's a fair comparison,\u201d he said, noting that that\u2019s how certain models trade the relationship between things like the NASDAQ and Ethereum. \u201cSo, we would tend to expect underperformance of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSVB and Sausage\n\nAs an example of how crypto has performed during recent risk-off events, Grant pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s outsized gains compared to Ethereum in the wake of several bank collapses in March, including Silicon Valley Bank. However, he noted that there\u2019s zero data to suggest how cryptocurrencies could react if the government defaults for the first time in history.\n\nBoth Grant and Magadini highlighted increased activity in the options market for Bitcoin as a potential default draws closer, saying it suggests that traders\u2014mostly institutional ones\u2014are betting the coin will see increased volatility.\n\nAt the end of the day, Grant said he\u2019s confident that lawmakers will exhaust their differences on Capitol Hill and reach an agreement like they always have. But, pointing to the logic of Bloomberg\u2019s Tom Keene, Grant said the bigger question is whether events like these become more common in an ever-more-polarized political climate, and if they\u2019ll ever go away.\n\n\u201cWe can ruminate and pontificate, but the real story is this phenomenon of the US government, as a debtor nation, bumping up against a debt ceiling,\u201d Grant said, adding it\u2019s become \u201chow the sausage gets made in the 21st century.\u201d"

        "title": "Unlocking the Potential: Best LSD Crypto Tokens to Add to Your Portfolio - The Economic Times",
        "content": "Thanks to the recent Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) have become the latest trend in the decentralized finance space (DeFi), offering stakers unconventional ways to unlock liquidity for their staked crypto assets and earn additional yields.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives are gaining momentum across the Ethereum network and have the potential to dominate other ecosystems, including major layer-1 blockchains like Avalanche and Polygon.\n\nRecent data from DeFiLlama shows that approximately $17.99 billion is currently locked up in LSDs, with Lido (currently the largest liquid staking protocol) dominating the space with approximately $11.95 billion total value locked (TVL).\n\nFollowing the major ethereum upgrade (also known as the Shanghai or Shapella upgrade), there has been a sharp rise in interest in LSDs, which has led to a surge in cash flow in DeFi and made staking more accessible to a lot of people who can now take advantage of both staking rewards and liquidity. The upgrade enables withdrawals from Ethereum staking contracts, significantly reducing the risk of holding staked Ethereum (stETH).\n\nWhat are liquid staking derivatives (LSDs)?\n\nLiquid Staking Derivatives (or Liquid Staking Tokens) are a unique kind of token that allows stakers to earn yield without losing the liquidity of their staked assets. These liquid tokens can be used in various ways; they can be sold, traded or used in Defi applications just like regular ETH.Staking tokens in proof-of-stake blockchains means locking tokens as collateral to secure the network and earn rewards, however, due to the lock-up nature, these tokens become illiquid.\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Revolution\n\nAfter the merge in September 2022, ethereum blockchain successfully swapped from Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. By moving from PoW to PoS, the Ethereum blockchain now relies on validators instead of miners to run it.\n\nSince the launch of Ethereum's Beacon Chain in December 2020, the first phase of the PoS transition, individuals could stake their ETH and serve as validators to process transactions and secure the network. To become a validator, stakers needed a specialized hardware and at least 32 ETH stake to run nodes themselves and receive rewards in blocks. However, they were unable to unstake their tokens and withdraw their rewards. Thanks to the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, validators can now unstake their staked ETH and withdraw their rewards.\n\nWhy are LSD tokens on the Rise?\n\nThe recent upgrade includes a code referred to as EIP 4895, which allows Beacon Chain staked ETH withdrawals, enabling a 1:1 exchange of staked Ether for Ether. With this development, ETH holders can now stake their tokens through liquid staking pools to generate yields, thus increasing the demand for LSDs and triggering rapid growth in DeFi TVL.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives solve the problem of capital inefficiency by providing users with a liquid and usable token representing their staked asset. They also eliminate the 32 ETH entry barrier, enabling anyone to stake any amount of ETH they can afford in exchange for additional yields.\n\nBest LSD Crypto Tokens In 2023\n\nLSD tokens have quickly become the biggest crypto trend in 2023. As such, an increasing number of DeFi protocols have rolled out to offer a more flexible way to stake and earn by providing LSDs.\n\nCurrently, 18.5 million ETH (~33.40 billion) are being staked in liquid staking pools. The annual percentage rate (APR) for staking ETH currently sits at around 8.98% today.\n\nAs Ethereum staking ratio increases, the use cases for liquid staking protocols and their tokens will also increase. Here are some of the best LSD protocols and their tokens for ETH holders looking to earn yield through staking.\n\n1) Lido ($LDO)\n\nAs a crypto trader, this is one of the best LSD tokens in the market to look out for. Lido is currently the largest liquid staking protocol dominating the space with an estimated $11.95 billion TVL at the time of writing. It has a market cap of about $2 billion, 85% of the total 1 billion LDO tokens are already in circulation.\n\nLido allows users to stake their ETH and earn additional rewards - with no lock ups and daily rewards. It supports Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Terra, Kusama and Polkadot.\n\nLDO \u2013 the native utility token, is used for granting governance rights and managing fee distribution. The token is available for trading on various exchanges, with cryptocurrency and stablecoin pairs currently available.\n\nWith LSDs on the rise, LDO has the potential to offer higher annual yield and market share than other protocols.\n\n2) Rocket Pool ($RPL)\n\nRocket Pool is one of the largest decentralized Ethereum LSD protocols after the Lido protocol. The protocol aims to reduce both the capital and hardware requirements for staking on ETH 2.0, adding to the decentralization and security of Ethereum.\n\nRPL is the ERC-20 utility token of Rocket Pool, and it's used to govern the PDAO and can be staked by node operators.\n\nUsers can run their own nodes with only 16 ETH and 1.6 ETH worth of RPL. Node operators stake RPL as insurance, where users stake Ether and receive rETH, a liquid ERC-20 token, in return. This token automatically accrues staking rewards based on the performance of the entire network of node operators.\n\nOn Rocket Pool, node operatives receive a delegation of 15 per cent, which covers their operational costs and incentivizes them to provide high quality services to their users.\n\nThe current Rocket Pool market capis $958,730,935 with a circulating supply of 19,401,735 RPL. Over the last year, Rocket Pool price has increased by 102.20%. During the last month, the price of RPL has risen by 5.09%.\n\nRPL is available on UniSwap (V3), Hoo, BKEX, XT.COM, Hotbit, and Bvnex.\n\n3) Tenet Protocol ($TENET)\n\nTenet, the first layer-1 blockchain to create a DeFi ecosystem for LSDs. The DeFi ecosystem implants a unique model called Diversified Proof of Stake (DiPoS), which supports staking with any LSD asset from other chains, such as ETH, BNB, ATOM, SOL and ADA. As such, Tenet becomes partially secured by all its supported networks, thus improving security compared to standard single-token Proof of Stake.\n\n$TENET is the native token of TENET. It is used at the base layer of the blockchain to pay for transaction execution as a gas token. TENET can also be staked in a Validator to secure the blockchain through TENET's revolutionary DiPoS--mechanism. When you stake TENET you will receive an LSD of TENET called tTENET. tTenet also needs to be locked up with the corresponding staking provider to receive Validation rewards from securing the blockchain.\n\nBy participating in Tenet validation and earning network transaction fees with LSDs like stETH and cbETH, one can still benefit from the ETH staking yield that these LSDs provide.\n\nThe platform offers a zero management fee, that is, it eliminates the 10% management fee charged by protocols like Lido, as a form of security incentivization.\n\nWith its unique blockchain mechanism and utility, the token is sure to be a promising one with significant use cases.\n\n4) Ankr ($ANKR)\n\nAnkr is a leading blockchain infrastructure provider which offers multi-chain API connections and runs RPC nodes besides staking solutions. The LSD protocol aims to make the adoption of Web3 easier by offering a platform where users can deploy nodes on PoS blockchains, stake their PoS tokens and access decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nANKR, the native utility and governance token of Ankr, has many use cases, including as payment for services within the Ankr ecosystem and as a means of earning passive income by staking. The Ethereum token can be used for on-chain governance and also as an insurance for network participants.\n\nWith a market cap of over $250 million and a maximum supply of 10 billion (100%), Ankr is one of the largest Ethereum staker and go-to staking infrastructure providers for ecosystems like the BNB, Polygon, and more.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade helped to bring back confidence in the Ethereum blockchain and served as fuel for LSD protocols. Issues like capital inefficiency and lock up periods that made stakes illiquid are now being resolved with the emergence of LSD protocols. By providing liquidity and yield opportunities for stakers, these protocols are unlocking the potential of the rapidly growing LSD market.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis is an advertorial.
