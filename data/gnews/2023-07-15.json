        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum\u2019s EIP-4844 upgrade could kickstart a rally in Layer 2 tokens.\n\nThe reduction in gas fees due to the introduction of a new transaction format via this update could significantly help users.\n\nSome altcoins that could potentially rally in anticipation of this upgrade include Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon.\n\nThe announcement of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit caused crypto investors to flip bullish after being confused for the last month due to Bitcoin\u2019s rangebound movement. But with Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 or EIP-4844, things might get interesting for a certain set of altcoins.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP -4844 turns experts bullish, will ETH price rally?\n\nEthereum gas fees to improve vastly in EIP-4844\n\nEthereum (ETH) has already undergone major hard forks in the last few years, ranging from London Hardfork to the recent Merge upgrade. All of these code changes are aimed at making the Ethereum blockchain more secure and scalable while keeping it decentralized.\n\nThe latest in the line of upgrades is the EIP-4844, aka Shard Blob Transactions update, which is aimed at reducing gas fees by introducing a special transaction type. The official EIP website for Ethereum summarizes the goal of this upgrade as follows.\n\nIntroduce a new transaction format for \u2018blob-carrying transactions\u2019 which contain a large amount of data that cannot be accessed by EVM execution, but whose commitment can be accessed. The format is intended to be fully compatible with the format that will be used in full sharding.\"\n\nThis new transaction formation will be forward-compatible and will be used in future upgrades of sharding.\n\nWhy Layer 2 solutions are in the spotlight?\n\nIn addition to preparing the Ethereum blockchain for full dank sharding, the EIP-4844 will have a huge impact on gas fees. Despite the Merge or London hard fork, the gas fees for Layer 1 (L1) solutions are still high for many users. While Layer 2 (L2) solutions have reduced gas fees by three to eight times than L1 chains, it is still high for many retail investors.\n\nAlthough EIP-4844 is aimed at reducing gas fees for Ethereum\u2019s beacon chain, the benefits of it will inevitably be compounded for Layer 2 scaling solutions. Hence, this update will attract many investors to interact with L2 chains like Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), Polygon (MATIC/POL) and so on.\n\nWhile this speculative move will improve the fundamentals of L2 chains, it will also attract traders and prospective buyers looking to capitalize, which could trigger a massive rally for these altcoins."

        "content": "Polkadot\u2019s revenue and fees remained stable last month, and TVL rose .\n\nMetrics and market indicators were bullish on the token.\n\nPolkadot [DOT] outperformed the rest of the crypto market as it was only behind Ethereum [ETH] at press time, reflecting higher adoption. Not only that, but the blockchain\u2019s key network stats also remained stable. While this happened, DOT\u2019s price gained upward momentum, thanks to the bullish market.\n\nRead Polkadot\u2019s [DOT] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nHowever, apart from its network activity and bullish market, quite a few other metrics were also at play that could have served their roles in supporting the uptrend.\n\nPolkadot\u2019s network activity is high\n\nOn 13 July, Polkadot Insider announced that Polkadot had outperformed several cryptos, and was only behind Ethereum in terms of daily active addresses in the last 30 days. While Ethereum had 350,000 daily active addresses, DOT had over 172,000.\n\nArbitrum [ARB], Avalanche [AVAX], and Optimism [OP] completed the top 5 of the list.\n\n\u26cf\ufe0f Let\u2019s explore the Top blockchains by Active Addresses in the past 30 days ?A high Active Addresses indicates a thriving and expanding blockchain ecosystem, highlighting its potential for long-term success and adoption Top 3 include:\n\n? @ethereum: 357,844\n\n? @Polkadot:\u2026 pic.twitter.com/8s2aKFapKa \u2014 Polkadot Insider (@PolkadotInsider) July 13, 2023\n\nIn addition, Token Terminal\u2019s data revealed that the blockchain\u2019s revenue and fees remained stable in the last month. In fact, the graph spiked on 3 July 2023. The blockchain\u2019s network value was also increasing as its TVL rose, as pointed out by DeFiLlama.\n\nWhile these developments happened, Polkadot\u2019s price action turned positive, thanks to the on-going bullish market. As per CoinMarketCap, DOT was up by more than 6% and 9% in the last 24 hours and week, respectively.\n\nAt the time of writing, it was trading at $5.63 with a market capitalization of over $6 billion, making it the 13th largest crypto. A look at DOT\u2019s metrics gave an understanding of what caused this surge.\n\nWhile DOT\u2019s price declined, its Open Interest also went down. Likewise, its price uptrend was accompanied by a hike in volume. Additionally, DOT\u2019s 1-week price volatility was high, supporting the chances of a continued uptrend.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s DOT\u2019s market cap in BTC;s terms\n\nShould DOT investors be cautious?\n\nPolkadot\u2019s uptrend might continue longer as the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbon displayed a bullish crossover. Not only that, but its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was also relatively high, suggesting a continued northbound movement.\n\nNonetheless, though DOT\u2019s Money Flow Index (MFI) was high, it did move down slightly. This can cause trouble and prevent the token\u2019s price from going up further."

        "title": "Azuki NFTs: Ethereum Blue-Chip or Hollow Cash Grab? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Love them or hate them, Azuki NFTs are everywhere. These anime-style Avatars are some of the most recognizable PFPs in the NFT market, second only to Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club.\n\nThe Azuki story is as polarizing as it is compelling. While Azuki NFT collections have boasted astronomic price appreciation and explosive trading volume, the ecosystem has been tarnished by a dark history of failed projects and disappointing new collections.\n\nDespite its flawed reputation, the Azuki NFT ecosystem has been a trendsetter within the cryptocurrency space. The Azuki community has been through multiple baptisms of fire and come out the other side uncharred and unfazed.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll take the Red Bean and go down the Rabbit Hole to explore all the non-fungible tokens and FUD that shape this mysterious and iconic Web3 startup.\n\nWhat Are Azuki NFTs?\n\nInitially, Azuki NFTs were a collection of 10,000 unique digital avatars, each boasting a distinctive Japanese anime-themed design. Launched in January 2022 by a group of artists based in Los Angeles, Azuki\u2019s skyrocketed in popularity, becoming a sensation in the Ethereum (ETH) NFT community.\n\nSince then, the Azuki Ecosystem has expanded, with multiple NFT collections and a tight-knit Web3 community. Ownership of an Azuki avatar grants access to a range of exclusive benefits, including Whitelist opportunities for new NFT drops, collaborations with streetwear brands, and invitations to live events.\n\nThis is all part of the Azuki vision to create a vibrant and interactive community known as The Garden, where artists, builders, and Web3 enthusiasts put their creative heads together to shape the future of the decentralized internet.\n\nThe Azuki Metaverse\n\nIf The Garden represents the beating heart of the Azuki community, Hilumia is the thriving on-chain Metaverse that will host Azuki\u2019s digital experience.\n\nHilumia development is still in its early stages, so it\u2019s still not completely clear what this blockchain-based digital universe will look like. The Azuki Metaverse is divided into ten separate areas, including a Skatepark, Dojo, and Arcade.\n\nWhat\u2019s Growing in The Garden: Azuki Collections\n\nA range of NFT collections have taken root and sprouted with the Azuki Garden. Each collection represents a different aspect of the Azuki universe, offering a diverse range of digital assets for collectors and enthusiasts.\n\nAzuki Main Collection\n\nThe Azuki main collection is the cornerstone of the Azuki universe. Launched in January 2022 through a Dutch Auction, Azukis are 10,000 unique digital avatars, each hand-drawn and boasting an anime-inspired aesthetic. These avatars have quickly gained popularity for their distinctive style and the unique traits they possess.\n\nDuring the initial mint, the Azuki NFT collection sold out in minutes, registering about $30 million USD in sales, trending on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, and catapulting Azuki into the spotlight of the NFT world.\n\nEach Azuki avatar is a unique piece of digital art, with individual characteristics that set it apart from the rest. From different hairstyles and clothing to unique accessories like swords, skateboards, and boomboxes, the diversity of Azuki avatars mirrors the community\u2019s diversity.\n\nLike Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, an Azuki pfp is one of the most popular digital flexes. Repping an Azuki NFT on social media is a sure way to get noticed within NFT circles.\n\nBeanz\n\nIn a bid to make entrance to The Garden more accessible and reward existing holders, Azuki Beanz sprouted from the dirt. Chiru Labs, the team behind the Azuki ecosystem, describes Beanz as sidekicks that help expand the wider Azuki community.\n\nDuring the Beanz airdrop, Azuki holders were gifted two new NFTs. At their all-time high, Beanz fetched 5 ETH on NFT Marketplaces. The Beanz airdrop was considered a shining success that not only rewarded loyal members of the Azuki community but also added a new layer of intrigue and anticipation around the Beanz collection.\n\nAzuki Elementals\n\nIf you can\u2019t tell the difference between OG Azuki\u2019s and Azuki Elementals, you\u2019re not alone. The release of Chiru Labs new collection was met with both anticipation and controversy. Despite raking in $38 million USD within 15 minutes of its release, the Elementals collection faced overwhelming criticism from community members.\n\nCan you blame them? Azuki Elementals are so similar in appearance to the original collection that many loyal supporters abandoned The Garden, calling Chiru Labs nothing more than grifters and cash-grab artists guilty of extracting millions from the NFT space.\n\nWhile there are slight differences and the occasional Animal avatar, the similarities in design and aesthetic led to a significant backlash, with critics arguing that the Azuki Elementals felt like a cheaper and diluted version of the main collection. In the wake of the controversy, Azuki ecosystem floor prices dumped by over 40%.\n\nIn a desperate bid to stop the flow of criticism from the crypto community, Chiru Labs acknowledged that they\u2019d made a blunder and pledged to improve communication and execution in the future.\n\nGolden Skateboards\n\nAzuki Golden Skateboards are perhaps the most daring and innovative product released by Chiru Labs. In a bold fusion of the physical and digital realms, Azuki made waves by auctioning eight Golden Skateboard NFTs. This creative auction raised a staggering $2.5 million and introduced a new concept to the NFT space: PBTs (Physically-Backed Tokens)\n\nThe Golden Skateboards are not just digital assets; they\u2019re tied to tangible, gold-plated skateboards that can be redeemed by burning the NFT. Weighing in at 45 pounds each, these skateboards are not recommended for riding but would make a statement as a physical piece of luxury art.\n\nThanks to a cryptographic \u2018BEAN chip\u2019 implanted in each board, the physical skateboards can be transferred digitally, separate from the original NFT. This unique blend of the material and digital worlds is a new take on the burgeoning \u201cphygital\u201d collectibles market.\n\nWhether holders of the Golden Skateboards choose to redeem their tokens for the physical skateboard or hold for resale value remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: Azuki\u2019s Golden Skateboards have added a new dimension to the NFT landscape, pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in the intersection of physical and digital collectibles.\n\nA Murky Past: Azuki History\n\nThe journey of Azuki has been a fascinating one, marked by rapid success, ambitious innovation, and a fair share of controversy.\n\nZagabond, the Azuki founder, has a shady past. He\u2019s faced criticism due to his association with previous projects that did not meet expectations. Prior to launching Azuki, Zagabond was involved with projects such as Cryptophunks, Cryptozunks, and Tendies. All of these collections failed to gain traction and ultimately did not succeed, with some being considered downright rugpulls that Zagabond abandoned.\n\nAzuki detractors suggest that these past failures as a cause for concern, questioning whether Azuki could suffer a similar fate. Some members of the NFT community have expressed skepticism about Zagabond\u2019s ability to deliver on the ambitious promises made by the Azuki project, given the track record of his previous ventures.\n\nOf course, supporters of Azuki argue that it\u2019s not all doom and gloom in the Garden. Past failures do not necessarily predict future outcomes. Azuki fans quickly point out Azuki\u2019s rapid success and innovation as evidence of Zagabond\u2019s ability to learn from past mistakes and adapt.\n\nDespite the controversy, Azuki has managed to carve out a significant place for itself in the NFT landscape, demonstrating that it is possible to overcome past setbacks and achieve success in the dynamic and often unpredictable world of NFTs.\n\nWhether they overcome the fallout of the Azuki Elementals debacle remains to be seen.\n\nAzuki Pros and Cons\n\nNFTs are a speculative asset class at best. Azuki comes with its own set of advantages and challenges that are worth considering if you\u2019re interesting in joining The Garden.\n\nPros\n\nIconic Art Style \u2013 Let\u2019s face it, Azuki\u2019s anime-inspired aesthetic is stunning. The distinctive and quality design of the avatars has resonated with a wide audience, contributing to the Azukis rapid success.\n\n\u2013 Let\u2019s face it, Azuki\u2019s anime-inspired aesthetic is stunning.

The fallout from the Elementals release has many collectors losing faith in Azuki\u2019s future.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nAzuki NFTs are an art-driven project. For collectors passionate about digital art and online communities, Azuki NFTs might be just what they\u2019re looking for, as opposed to an investment vehicle.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe Azuki NFT Ecosystem is arguablely the largest outside Yuga Labs. Azuki inspired dozens of similar NFT collections to adopt anime-inspired art or side-facing pfps. Despite Azuki\u2019s criticism, they have proven to set trends for others to follow.\n\nFAQs"
