        "summary": "  Ethereum price has been stuck below $1,920 for 16 days, with no signs of changing in the short term. The latest breakout attempt lasted less than 24 hours. The Ethereum network's high transaction fees and reduced demand for its decentralized finance ecosystem are likely causes for the price stagnation. Total Ethereum deposits are stable, but there's a catch, as high gas fees reduce demand for smart contract usage. DEX volume on the BNB Smart Chain has surpassed Ethereum's, and the number of active addresses interacting with DApps is declining. Data suggests that professional traders are avoiding leveraged longs (bullish bets) and there is no imminent driver to justify a sustainable rally above $1,920 in the short term."
