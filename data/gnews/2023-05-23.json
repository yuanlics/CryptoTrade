        "content": "As artificial intelligence (AI) technology is witnessing renewed worldwide and cross-industry interest sparked by the release of ChatGPT, the text-based AI platform has proven its worth in analyzing the cryptocurrency market to provide insights into the future price trends of assets such as Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn this context, Finbold has asked ChatGPT to share its predictions on the potential trading range of Ethereum by the end of 2023, and after dutifully stating that it could not predict future prices, it has provided multiple factors that could affect ETH price by the year\u2019s end.\n\nFactors affecting ETH price\n\nSpecifically, as for some of these factors, ChatGPT has singled out the overall sentiment and perception of Ethereum within the crypto community and general market, arguing that \u201cpositive sentiment, increased adoption, and growing interest from investors may potentially drive the price higher.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the AI chatbot explained that \u201cthe development and implementation of new features, upgrades, and improvements to the Ethereum network can impact its price,\u201d such as the Ethereum 2.0 update, as well as highlighted the influence of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nChatGPT on Bitcoin affecting Ethereum price. Source: ChatGPT\n\nOn top of that, ChatGPT said that Ethereum had \u201ca large and active community of developers, users, and supporters,\u201d the growth of which, along with the continued development of decentralized applications (dApps) on the platform, could also positively impact the price.\n\nAccording to the AI language model, other influential factors include regulatory changes and government policies related to cryptocurrencies, economic conditions and geopolitical events, as well as social media platforms, news articles, and influential figures within the crypto space.\n\nAI ETH price prediction\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto price prediction platform CoinPriceForecast has been able to deliver specific figures on the possible price of Ethereum for the coming years, including by the end of 2023, with the current projection standing at $2,142, which would represent an increase of 15% to the price of the digital asset as of May 23.\n\nEthereum 2023 price projection. Source: CoinPriceForecast\n\nInterestingly, the latest year-end numbers are close to the earlier long-term forecast from February 2023, when the same platform placed the price of Ethereum at $2,146 by the end of 2023, although the mid-year figures were a lot more bullish, as Finbold reported on February 23.\n\nMore recently, in April, a poll of 32 fintech and crypto experts projected that the price of Ethereum could reach its peak in 2023 at around $2,758. However, after that, they expect the price to start dropping again in the second half of 2023, sinking to the still bullish $2,342 by the end of the year.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Ethereum is currently trading hands at the price of $1,856, recording an increase of 2.18% in the last 24 hours and a 2.13% gain over the previous seven days, as it moves to reverse the 0.84% decline on its monthly chart. Since the year\u2019s start, ETH has grown 54.56%.\n\nEthereum year-to-date (YTD) price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nWhether Ethereum truly manages to push toward the projected price by the end of 2023 will, indeed, depend on the factors enumerated by ChatGPT, particularly the positive sentiment that could be driven by developments such as record-breaking staking returns after the recent \u2018Shapella\u2019 upgrade.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Ether\u2019s price has been stuck below $1,920 for the past 16 days, which is especially concerning since the latest breakout attempt on May 6 lasted less than 24 hours. Excluding this brief price pump, Ether\u2019s (ETH) journey below $1,920 was initiated on April 21, over 30 days ago.\n\nOne can likely blame the Ethereum network\u2019s $8.80 average transaction fee for investors\u2019 diminished appetite, but the macroeconomic environment has also played an important role. On May 22, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said it is impossible to predict the outcome of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy, designed to curb inflation.\n\nAs CNN reported, Dimon added:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already seeing credit tighten up because the easiest way for a bank to retain capital is not to make the next loan.\"\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the United States debt ceiling standoff between Joe Biden\u2019s administration and the U.S. Congress is the probable cause for the worsening sentiment among institutional investors toward cryptocurrencies. According to CoinShares\u2019 latest \u201cDigital Asset Fund Flows Report,\" outflows across digital asset investment products hit $232 million over the past five weeks.\n\nFurthermore, there are two indicators that impact Ether\u2019s price and signal reduced demand for its decentralized finance ecosystem, in addition to weak leverage buying activity from professional traders.\n\nTotal Ethereum deposits are stable, but there\u2019s a catch\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s limited processing capabilities have been causing high gas fees, which greatly reduces the demand for smart contract usage. For the past five weeks, the average transaction fee has remained above $8, although at first sight, no impact was felt.\n\nEthereum network applications' total deposits in ETH. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe total value locked (TVL) in the network remained stable at 15.1 million ETH versus four weeks prior, but it is nearing the lowest levels since August 2020. As a comparison, the TVL on the BNB Smart Chain in BNB (BNB) terms was essentially flat in the same period, while TRX (TRX) deposits on the Tron network declined by 12%.\n\nBNB Smart Chain flips Ethereum\u2019s lead in DEX volume\n\nEthereum has historically been the absolute leader in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, but it all changed in the week ending May 21.\n\nWeekly DEX volume by chain. Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s DEX market share drastically dropped from a 75.5% peak on March 5 to 22.3% on May 21. Meanwhile, BNB Smart Chain was the biggest beneficiary, growing to 61.1% from 5.6%.\n\nThe number of active addresses interacting with decentralized applications (DApps) is also in a slump. Over the last 30 days, the top 12 DApps running on the Ethereum network saw an 11% drop in active addresses, possibly reflecting investor dissatisfaction with the high transaction costs.\n\n30-day Ethereum DApp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nData shows drop leverage traders using derivatives\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 4 to 8% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to the futures premium, known as the basis indicator, Ether professional traders have avoided leveraged longs (bullish bets) for the past four weeks. Moreover, not even the brief rally toward $2,000 on May 6 was enough to flip those whales and market makers into bullish sentiment.\n\nIn short, these three indicators signal bearishness \u2014 namely, the record-low DEX market share, the declining addresses engaging with DApps and a lack of leveraged buying demand.\n\nMaybe investors were expecting some kind of announcement out of Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin\u2019s appearance at Edcon 2023 in Montenegro, which wasn\u2019t the case \u2014 the fact is there\u2019s no imminent driver to justify a sustainable rally above $1,920 in the short term.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Death Sentence: Fact or Fiction?\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors alike have been buzzing with rumors that Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, is on the verge of collapse.\n\nSome skeptics claim that the Ethereum network\u2019s high gas fees and scalability issues have rendered it obsolete, while others believe that Ethereum\u2019s future remains bright.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look closer at Ethereum\u2019s current state and its potential for long-term growth.\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nThe Controversy Surrounding Ethereum\u2019s Future\n\nEthereum has been a hot topic of discussion in the cryptocurrency community lately. The network\u2019s scalability issues have resulted in high gas fees, making it difficult for small investors to participate.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism has also been criticized for inefficiency. On the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s supporters argue that the network\u2019s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) will address these issues and ensure its longevity.\n\nDuring the cryptocurrency frenzy, skeptics are raising eyebrows and questioning the future of Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nThe debate heats up with critics voicing concerns about their viability, potential manipulation, environmental impact, and outdated technology.\n\nDiscover the eight reasons why some experts believe these digital assets may become relics and explore the emerging alternatives that could reshape the investment landscape.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum: Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake\n\nEthereum\u2019s PoW algorithm requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. This process consumes significant energy and has been criticized for contributing to climate change.\n\nEthereum 2.0, the network\u2019s upcoming upgrade, will transition to PoS, eliminating the need for miners and reducing energy consumption. PoS allows network participants to secure the network by staking their cryptocurrency, with rewards proportional to their stake.\n\nIs Ethereum dead?\n\nDespite the criticism surrounding Ethereum, the network remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The Ethereum network\u2019s decentralization and its role as a platform for decentralized applications (dapps) have contributed to its popularity.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s high gas fees have made it difficult for small investors and dapp developers to use the network. The network\u2019s scalability issues have also resulted in slower transaction times, further hindering its adoption.\n\nWhat the Experts Say About Ethereum\u2019s Future\n\nSource: Business Today\n\nMany experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s future is bright, despite its current challenges.\n\nThe network\u2019s transition to PoS will improve its scalability and energy efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s role as a platform for dapps and decentralized finance (DeFi) has attracted significant investment and development. Some experts predict that Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization could exceed that of Bitcoin in the future.\n\nThe Relationship Between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. While Bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value and a medium of exchange, Ethereum\u2019s platform enables the creation of decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nEthereum\u2019s supporters argue that its versatility and potential for innovation make it a more valuable asset than Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s first-mover advantage and wider adoption have contributed to its dominance in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum vs. Competitors: Where Does Ethereum Stand?\n\nEthereum faces competition from other blockchain platforms, including Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, and Cardano.\n\nWhile these platforms offer similar functionality to Ethereum, they have different approaches to scalability and consensus.\n\nBinance Smart Chain, for example, uses a delegated proof of stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, while Cardano uses a proof of stake (PoS) mechanism. Ethereum\u2019s supporters argue that its established network effect and development community give it an advantage over its competitors.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Potential for long-term growth\n\nDespite its current challenges, Ethereum\u2019s potential for long-term growth remains strong. The network\u2019s transition to PoS is expected to improve its energy efficiency and scalability, making it more accessible to small investors and dapp developers.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s role as a platform for DeFi and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) has attracted significant investment and development. Some experts predict that Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization could exceed that of Bitcoin in the future.\n\nWill Ethereum recover in 2023? Examining the Possibilities\n\nPredicting the future of any cryptocurrency is challenging, and Ethereum is no exception.\n\nHowever, many experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS and the continued development of the network\u2019s infrastructure could lead to a significant recovery in the coming years.\n\nAdditionally, the growing adoption of DeFi and NFTs could drive demand for Ethereum and its associated tokens. While there are no guarantees in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum\u2019s potential for growth remains strong.\n\nThe Role of Ethereum in the Crypto Market\n\nEthereum is pivotal in the cryptocurrency market, serving as a platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. The network\u2019s versatility and potential for innovation have attracted significant investment and development, making it a valuable asset for investors.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS and its role in DeFi and NFTs could drive demand for the network\u2019s associated tokens, further increasing their value.\n\nConclusion: Is Ethereum Dead?\n\nIn conclusion, are Ethereum and Bitcoin dead? Not really.\n\nWhile Ethereum faces challenges, its potential for long-term growth remains strong. The network\u2019s transition to PoS and its role in developing DeFi and NFTs could significantly increase demand for Ethereum and its associated tokens.\n\nWhile there are no guarantees in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum\u2019s established network effect and development community give it an advantage over its competitors.\n\nAs such, ETH\u2019s future remains bright despite the rumors of Ethereum being dead."
