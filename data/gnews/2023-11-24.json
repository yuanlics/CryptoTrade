        "content": "Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD pumped higher during Friday\u2019s 24-hour trading session, attempting to break up from an inside bar pattern, while the SPDR S&P 500 consolidated flat.\n\nLike Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin DOGE/USD broke up from its inside bar pattern and was showing comparative strength, holding well above the top of Wednesday\u2019s range.\n\nAn inside bar pattern indicates a period of consolidation and is usually followed by a continuation move in the direction of the current trend.\n\nAn inside bar pattern has more validity on larger time frames (four-hour charts or larger). The pattern has a minimum of two candlesticks and consists of a mother bar (the first candlestick in the pattern) followed by one or more subsequent candles. The subsequent candle(s) must be completely inside the range of the mother bar, and each is called an \"inside bar.\"\n\nA double, or triple inside bar can be more powerful than a single inside bar. After the break of an inside bar pattern, traders want to watch for high volume for confirmation the pattern was recognized.\n\nWant direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.\n\nThe Bitcoin and Ethereum Charts: Bitcoin and Ethereum created an inside bar pattern on Wednesday and Thursday, and on Friday the cryptos were attempting to break up from the patterns but were rejecting heavy resistance above. A lack of volume was contributing to weakness in the move, which may indicate further consolidation is needed, at least on smaller timeframes.\n\nThe consolidation on Bitcoin and Ethereum, which has taken place since Nov. 10, has helped to drop their relative strength index (RSI) down from overbought territory to under the 70% level. This indicates that Bitcoin and Ethereum could eventually rally further north if bullish volume continues to power the cryptos.\n\nBullish traders want to see big bullish volume come in and break Bitcoin and Ethereum up above Friday\u2019s new high-of-day, which could accelerate upside momentum. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and drop Bitcoin and Ethereum down under the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA), which would negate the current upward trend.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $38,105 and at $39,600 and support below at $35,593 and at $31,862.\n\nIf Dogecoin closes Friday\u2019s 24-hour trading session near its high-of-day price, the crypto will form a bullish Marubozu candlestick, which could indicate higher prices will come again on Saturday. When the crypto eventually prints a reversal candlestick, such as a doji or shooting star candlestick, it could indicate the local top has occurred.\n\nBearish traders want to see Dogecoin fall under the eight-day EMA, which could indicate the downtrend will continue and the local top has formed.\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.083 and at 9 cents and support below at $0.075 and at the 7-cent mark.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Singapore --News Direct-- Bing Ventures Limited\n\nBing Ventures, a Singapore-based early-stage venture capital and research firm, hosted a major gathering of more than 300 blockchain and Web3 leaders and participants in an event titled \u201cEthereum 2030: Unraveling Tomorrow\u2019s Innovations\u201d on November 15, 2023, in Istanbul.\n\nSet against Devconnect 2023, a week-long gathering that features independent Ethereum events, Ethereum 2030 convenes both international and local experts to explore the next wave of innovations shaping the future of Ethereum and a new generation of crypto entrepreneurship.\n\nHere\u2019s what global leaders had to say about Ethereum and the broader blockchain and Web3 ecosystem.\n\nTradFi Players to Increasingly Integrate On-chain Solutions\n\nIn a panel discussion on decentralized finance (DeFi), speakers explored recent changes in the DeFi market structure and some promising new narratives. Dougie DeLuca, Investor at Figment Capital mentioned the fact that DeFi protocols are becoming MEV conscious, which could be a huge thing and make the whole system way more profitable. Anne-Grace Kleczewski, Co-Founder and Chief Legal Officer at Keom Protocol shared her opinion about why zero-knowledge proofs and account abstraction technologies have great potential in DeFi. Luca (Moss) Mossini, BD at Avantgarde and Enzyme Finance, emphasized the importance of having more traditional finance (TradFi) players integrating on-chain solutions because some could continue to be the last-mile access for users.\n\nThey also talked about the rise of liquid staking derivatives and whether the current state of Ethereum staking had a concentration issue. Other topics covered include real-world assets, growing awareness of DeFi, restaking solutions, and the ongoing battle to reach the masses.\n\nThe panel discussion was moderated by Daria Krasnova, Managing Editor at BeInCrypto and participated by Dougie DeLuca, Investor at Figment Capital, Luca (Moss) Mossini, BD at Avantgarde & Enzyme Finance, Anne-Grace Kleczewski, Co-Founder and Chief Legal Officer at Keom Protocol, Mete (Ali) Ba\u015fkaya, Blockchain & Crypto Lecturer and Seraphim Czecker, Head of Growth at Ethena Labs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI-powered Builder Identification\n\nJack He, Co-founder of Aspecta shared how they are leveraging AI technologies like large language models (LLM) and image recognition to build an identity solution for builders to consolidate their behavior data across different platforms.\n\nAspecta enables builders to create LinkedIn-like identity pages and credentials to showcase their skills, experience, and impact, which the team believes fills an important gap and helps to facilitate growth and collaboration among different developer ecosystems.\n\nCollaboration among Security Solution Providers Needed\n\nIn a panel discussion on Web3 security, security experts from MetaMask Snaps, Matter Labs, Certik, DTS Project, and MetaTrust Labs shared their observations as to the current state of Web3 security and some of the emerging threats.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, they also shared some cutting-edge solutions designed to safeguard the Web3 ecosystem and the lessons learned from the high-profile hacks in the last year.\n\nAn\u0131l \u00d6z, Chief Technology Officer at DATS Project emphasized that he thought every cyber security service provider should collaborate and share their knowledge to build a safer and more secure Web3 future.\n\nLastly, they talked about how individuals can effectively guard against personal losses by using tools such as browser extensions and Metamask\u2019s Blockaid security alerts, an experimental function to be standardized in Q1 2024.\n\nThe panel discussion was moderated by Sima Baktas, Web3 Attorney at GlobalB Law and Co-Founder of CryptoFemale, Anton Astafiev, VP of Security at Matter Labs, Christian Montoya, Senior Product Owner at MetaMask Snaps, Connie Lam, Head of Solution Architect at CertiK, An\u0131l \u00d6z, Chief Technology Officer at DATS Project and TY Shao, Chief Business Officer at MetaTrust Labs.\n\nCrypto Entrepreneurs Gaining Valuable Experience during the Bear Market\n\nIn a panel discussion on crypto entrepreneurship, global and local project leaders shared their firsthand experience of building cryptocurrency businesses. While they highlighted challenges such as user education, lack of service providers, lack of prior examples to draw upon as well as legal and regulatory uncertainties, they shared an opinion that building products that solve real-world problems, focusing on user experiences, and finding creative ways to collaborate with other players are critical strategies founders should prioritize to navigate through these challenges.\n\nCommenting on the phenomenon that many crypto entrepreneurs are pivoting to AI to capture venture capital\u2019s interest, Bertu\u011f Oymak, Co-Founder and CEO of Utilify noted that entrepreneurs should build products for their customers instead of investors. He advised startups to \u201cride the hype\u201d when necessary but always build the war chest for survival as founders will eventually have to face a bear market.\n\nArif Kalem, Brand Ambassador of Turkey at BingX added to underline that marketing and communications is a non-stop process and should not be undervalued in bear markets.\n\nCommenting on Turkey\u2019s crypto landscape, Erkan G\u00fcl, Founder of Moseiki App mentioned that the number of trader communities is too high compared to builder communities, but the transformation is underway.\n\nThe panel discussion was moderated by \u00d6zge ERDEM\u0130R, Web3 Advisor, Business Developer, and participated by Bertu\u011f Oymak, Co-Founder and CEO of Utilify, Erkan G\u00fcl, Founder of Moseiki App, Victor Yu, Co-Founder of Carv and Arif Kalem, Brand Ambassador of Turkey at BingX.\n\nA New Paradigm to Secure Protocols and LP Assets on Ethereum\n\nYajin (Andy) Zhou, CEO of Blocksec launched Phalcon Block, an automated attack-blockchain system, at the conference.
