        "title": "Ether futures ETFs fizzle on US debut - Financial Times",
        "summary": "  The debut of nine ETFs tracking ether futures in the US has underwhelmed with modest investor interest, compared to the successful launch of the first US bitcoin ETF last year. The ETFs saw combined trading volume of $6.6 million on their first day, significantly lower than the $1 billion garnered by the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF in its first two days of trading. The lackluster launch is attributed to continued weak retail sentiment towards cryptocurrencies and the fact that the SEC has yet to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, despite the approval of futures-based ETFs. However, some analysts believe that the launch of ether futures ETFs may pave the way for a spot ethereum ETF in the US."

        "summary": "  Ethereum's (ETH) price has declined by 6.7% since the launch of ETH futures ETFs on September 2, despite the expected increase in price. The launch of these ETFs failed to generate significant investor interest, with combined trading volumes of $1.92 million on debut day, significantly lower than similar product launches. The price of ETH is currently testing the $1,641 level, with the potential to move towards $2,000. However, the current pattern may be invalid, and the price could be heading towards a new downturn. The key determinant of the future outlook is how the price behaves around the $1,660 level."

        "summary": "  Ethereum failed to rally as new ETF trading volumes disappointed, with Proshares Ethereum ETF trading only 21,000 shares and VanEck\u2019s Ethereum Strategy ETF trading 29,000 shares. Despite the SEC approval of Ether futures ETFs, sentiment in the cryptoverse remains weak due to ongoing Treasury selloff and SEC delays in approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. Ethereum posted a brief rally after the ETF launches but faded quickly due to resistance from the 50- and 200-day SMA. If bearishness resumes, downside targets include $1510."

ProShares' EETH and VanEck's EFUT were the most popular, with $850,000 and $500,000 in trading volume, respectively. The slow interest in the futures ETFs could be a prelude to price action, and some analysts believe that futures-only ETFs can be detrimental to spot prices. Bitcoin fell 2.3% in the last day, and volatility is expected to increase, while Ethereum dropped 3.8% in line with the broader crypto market."

This is significantly less than the volume of the first-ever Bitcoin Futures ETF, which recorded over $200 million in the first 15 minutes after launch. The poor volume for the Ethereum ETF is attributed to the SEC's hesitation in approving crypto ETF products, despite industry pressure and a recent legal victory for Grayscale. The regulator is facing pressure from lawmakers to approve more Bitcoin spot ETFs in the near term."

This drop is despite a surge in open interest, which is typically a sign of bullish behavior.

This is compared to ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which debuted in October 2021 with over $1 billion in trading volume. ETF firm Volatility Shares canceled its plans to list a similar product.
