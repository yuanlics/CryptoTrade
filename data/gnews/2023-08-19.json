        "summary": "  The article discusses whether Ethereum (ETH) is undervalued at its current price of around $1,730, despite its recent 45% year-to-date gain. The author argues that Ethereum is still a good investment opportunity for several reasons:\n\n1. Innovation leader: Ethereum has a strong track record of innovation and is the de facto benchmark standard for other blockchains.\n2. Diversification benefits: Ethereum has the largest community of blockchain developers and a growing ecosystem, providing diversification benefits for investors.\n3. Roadmap for success: Ethereum has a clear roadmap for development, including milestones such as increasing transaction processing abilities to 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nHowever, the author also acknowledges potential risks, such as regulatory challenges and the emergence of an \"Ethereum killer.\" Despite these risks, the author believes that Ethereum's upside potential is too high to ignore, especially given its recent discount."

        "summary": "  This week in coins, Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced a sharp drop of 10-20%, with altcoins taking an even harder hit. The flash crash was triggered by a sudden sell-off in the market, likely due to a combination of factors such as declining market liquidity and the filing for bankruptcy protection by Chinese property giant Evergrande. The most resilient cryptocurrency in the top 20 by market cap was TRON, which only fell 4.8%. Regulatory uncertainty continued to affect the market, with a U.S. bank regulator dedicating two pages in its annual report to crypto, highlighting potential risks to the financial system."

The regulator has been flooded with applications since July and has not instructed firms to withdraw their applications, suggesting that the launch of these funds is imminent. At least 16 applications for Ether or Bitcoin-Ether futures ETFs are awaiting regulatory approval. The first-mover advantage in the ETF industry is important, as the first approved futures Bitcoin ETF has gathered $1 billion in assets under management since its inception, while a similar product launched a few days later amassed nearly $28 million in assets under management. The SEC has yet to decide on a spot Bitcoin ETF, with a final verdict due by January."

A resurgence by XRP bulls could send the price north, but a negative outcome in the lawsuit could lead to a slump."

        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) reached an all-time high price of $4,878 and market cap of $548.4 billion on November 10, 2021. However, its token's inflation still affects its price. Two updates to the Ethereum network, London Upgrade and The Merge, have changed the supply dynamics for Ether. The London Upgrade introduced a burning mechanism, while The Merge switched the network from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, reducing ETH's emission. Since then, around 3 million ETH have been added to the circulating supply, and the network burns an average of 1.75 million ETH per year. Recently, Visa introduced the possibility of paying gas fees on Ethereum with a Visa credit card. The price of ETH has been trading as low as $1,680, and it's uncertain if it will reach its all-time high market cap. Some experts predicted a price drop, but two positive signs were spotted on Ethereum."
