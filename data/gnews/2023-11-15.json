        "summary": "  Will Ethereum surpass Bitcoin? The answer is not straightforward, as both cryptocurrencies have their unique strengths and weaknesses. However, there are several factors that could suggest Ethereum has a higher potential for growth and adoption.\n\n1. Scalability: Ethereum is working on improving its scalability issues through the implementation of ETH 2.0, which could increase its transaction capacity and reduce congestion. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a fixed block size, which can limit its scalability.\n2. Smart Contracts: Ethereum's smart contract functionality allows for a wide range of use cases beyond simple financial transactions. This could lead to increased adoption and popularity. Bitcoin's smart contract capabilities are more limited.\n3. Programmability: Ethereum's programmability enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which could lead to new revenue streams and increased adoption. Bitcoin's programmability is more limited.\n4. Community: Ethereum has a growing and active community of developers, users"

Despite a decrease to approximately $3.61, fees remain within the range of the highest observed in the past three months. The increase in fees has had a favorable impact on network fees, which have climbed from approximately $1 million to over $5 million. However, both network fees and transaction fees have decreased in recent days due to a decrease in trading volume and a drop in ETH price.
