        "summary": "  In a new paper, EY explores the concept of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) on Ethereum, a complex systemic challenge arising from overlapping preferences of market participants. MEV is defined as the value captured by participants in the Ethereum network, including Flashbots, which emerged serendipitously. The paper examines the MEV supply chain on both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake Ethereum, and discusses mitigation and redistribution strategies being developed by top researchers. The paper concludes that users may ultimately occupy the privileged position historically held by miners."

This upgrade allows for on-chain analysis and perpetual storage of data, making it possible for scientists to conduct research on the blockchain. The smart contracts also bring the first decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to Filecoin, allowing users to stake and generate yield by lending FIL tokens to storage providers. This update is expected to make the network more economically sustainable and increase revenue for the protocol."

        "summary": "  Ethereum (ETH) price has been underperforming against Bitcoin (BTC) in the past six months, despite the upgrades to the Ethereum network. The ETH/BTC price ratio has been trading at around 0.068 since October 2022, with a recent breakdown below this level on March 15. This has led to a decrease in investor confidence, as seen in the decline in leverage long positions and the lack of demand for options contracts. The derivatives market indicates that professional traders are hesitant to place either bullish or bearish bets, and the 25% delta skew metric has reached its highest level of skepticism since November 2022."

        "summary": "  Ethereum has introduced a new URL standard called ERC-4804, which allows users to access decentralized applications (DApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) directly without relying on centralized servers. The new standard, called \"Web3 URLs,\" uses a \"HTTP-style\" URL to directly access on-chain Web3 content, such as DApps front-ends and NFTs. This means that users can type in \"web3://\" instead of \"http://\" in their browsers to access these decentralized services. The new standard is expected to be useful for DApps or websites at risk of censorship, such as Tornado Cash, and could potentially allow for \"dynamic data\" and interaction with other blockchains. However, the costs of using this new standard are still prohibitive for many applications, according to ETHStorage founder Qi Zhou."
