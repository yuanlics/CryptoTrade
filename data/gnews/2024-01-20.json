        "content": "Top analyst and crypto commentator who goes by @hedge__x on X (formerly Twitter) is sure that Ethereum (ETH) has all chances to outshine Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming bull run.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Max pain for Bitcoin Dominance\": Trader skeptical about Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, is going to set a new all-time high in this cycle. However, even over $100,000 per BTC, it will be disappointing for many Bitcoiners, @hedge__x shared on Jan. 19 on his X.\n\nCorn is going higher this cycle but many will be disappointed at $100k peak.\n\n\n\nETH has much more upside potential w many more future catalyst including ETF.\n\n\n\nMax pain for BTC.D.

Among other catalysts, Ethereum (ETH) has possible ETF approval ahead. This might be an amazing catalyst for the next ETH rally.\n\nIt should be noted that Ethereum (ETH) is getting closer to EIP-4844 or Proto-Danksharding upgrade activation. It is set to change the game in L2s and make them more resource-efficient.\n\nAs such, the analyst is positive about the potential of Total2, an indicator of cumulative cryptocurrency markets capitalization excluding Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) indicator is due to go through \"maximum pain,\" the trader concluded.\n\nLegal status of Ether is crucial for ETH ETF approval\n\nIn January 2024, Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is losing momentum. After registering a local high over 55% on Jan. 9, it lost 7.5% (4.6 points) in less than 10 days.\n\nEthereum ETF is one of the most anticipated events for the cryptocurrency segment in 2024. The community and experts are moderately optimistic about its potential approval.\n\nHowever, the court processes between the U.S. SEC and crypto exchanges over illegal securities offering might affect the timeline of the ETH ETF approval.\n\nTogether with other large-cap altcoins, Ether is one of the tokens the SEC claimed to be unregistered securities."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024, Is $6000 Possible? - Live Bitcoin News",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently shown remarkable resilience and strength in the crypto market. As of now, Ethereum is trading at $2,563, reflecting a minor drop of -2.67% over the past 24 hours. This decline follows a period of impressive growth in which ETH surged by 23.22% in just three weeks. The recent bullish momentum has catapulted Ethereum back above the 50% level, signaling a potential continuation of the positive price action in the coming months. The ETH price prediction algorithm paints an even more optimistic picture, forecasting a staggering +253% price increase by the second quarter of 2024. If this prediction holds, Ethereum could be valued at an all-time high of $6,339.What\u2019s driving this anticipated surge? The primary catalyst is the upcoming Bitcoin (BTC) halving event, a significant occurrence in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nUnderstanding the Bitcoin Halving and Its Timing\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event takes place approximately every four years or after every 210,000 blocks mined. During this event, the rewards miners receive for verifying transactions and securing the network are halved. This reduction in mining rewards introduces deflationary pressure into the Bitcoin ecosystem, gradually decreasing the supply of new BTC entering circulation. Historically, Bitcoin\u2019s deflationary mechanism has triggered new bull markets for cryptocurrencies. Each halving event has been followed by a surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price, ultimately leading to new all-time highs. The last Bitcoin halving took place in 2020, and the next one is scheduled for April 15, 2024.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Potential Post-Halving Growth\n\nEthereum has a history of significant price increases following Bitcoin\u2019s halving events. After the previous BTC halving, Ethereum\u2019s price skyrocketed by +2133%. This remarkable surge firmly established Ethereum as the second-most valuable cryptocurrency, propelling its native token, Ether (ETH), from $217 to an astonishing $4,864 within 18 months. One trader, known as Sporia on TradingView, has charted a long-term projection for ETH\u2019s price. The chart highlights two parallel trading channels that Ethereum has followed since the 2018 alt season, featuring a strong support line that has withstood the bearish market conditions of 2022 and 2023. Sporia points out an essential indicator: the reversal indicator signal, which has only been triggered four times in Ethereum\u2019s history, each time preceding a massive rally. According to Sporia\u2019s analysis, Ethereum is likely to maintain this market structure over the next five years. The upper resistance line in the chart provides price targets for Ethereum during the next two bullish phases of Bitcoin\u2019s four-year cycles, including a target of $16,090 in 2025. This represents an impressive +799% price increase from its current level. While Ethereum has experienced relative underperformance compared to other cryptocurrencies during recent bullish periods, with a +60% gain compared to the total crypto market cap\u2019s +80% rise in the past year, this should not raise alarm. Ethereum underwent a significant upgrade during the bear market, transitioning from a proof-of-work to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, known as The Merge. Moreover, Ethereum has benefited from increased regulatory clarity from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the introduction of new exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 scaling solutions have made substantial progress, further boosting the demand for the native ETH token. In summary, Ethereum is poised for significant growth, with a price prediction algorithm suggesting a +253% increase in the next seven months. This projection aligns with the timing of the next Bitcoin halving event, which could catalyze Ethereum\u2019s surge to new all-time highs. Amid the excitement surrounding Ethereum\u2019s potential and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, another cryptocurrency is making waves in the crypto market\u2014Retik Finance (RETIK).

It would allow investors to gain exposure to digital assets without directly owning them.\n\nAccording to James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, the SEC may choose to approve a batch of spot Ethereum ETFs as it did with Bitcoin.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is currently awaiting the introduction of an Ethereum ETF after the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, because of Pullix\u2019s security, investors are becoming more interested in ERC20 tokens.\n\nWhat Has Happened To Bitcoin (BTC) Since Its ETF Approval?\n\nThe United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs\u2014the news of the approval spiraled across the crypto community.\n\nBefore the approval, analysts predicted a surge in Bitcoin price due to increased inflows from institutional investors. Standard Chartered analysts predicted fund inflows ranging from $50 billion to $100 billion in 2024.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has yet to rally a few days after the Bitcoin ETF approval. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin price has fluctuated between $41,753.68 and $48,494.62 in the past week.\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin is facing huge selling pressure around the $48k level. Still, analysts remain bullish on the flagship cryptocurrency. All eyes are now on the Bitcoin halving to spark a bullish run. Analysts predict a surge to $50k and $100k in the long run.\n\nEthereum (ETH) ETF Approval Coming?\n\nSince the US SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETF, the crypto community has been betting on spot Ethereum ETFs. While some analysts believe spot Ethereum ETFs could be next in line, others have a different opinion. An example of such an analyst is JPMorgan\u2019s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the regulator must classify Ethereum as a commodity before approving spot Ethereum ETFs. On the other hand, Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas forecasts a 70% possibility that an Ethereum ETF will be approved by May.\n\nSeveral big firms, including Fidelity and BlackRock, have filed for spot Ethereum ETFs. An approval of Ethereum ETF could push the price of Ethereum as high as $4500, per analysts.\n\nPullix (PLX) Native Token Catches Investors\u2019 Interest\n\nPullix (PLX) ERC20 token, PLX, has been the main talk of investors since the beginning of its presale. The token is built on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning more security. Also, its price has increased 100% to $0.08 in less than a month. All these have gained attention among investors.\n\nThe upcoming launch of the Pullix exchange also adds to the increased interest from investors. This DeFi project is prepared to launch in Q1 2024 following its presale. It is a hybrid exchange platform, combining the strengths of both centralized and decentralized exchanges.\n\nUsers of the Pullix platform are able to trade in a range of markets such as stocks, commodities, forex indices and options. Daily turnover in the forex market is more than $6.6 trillion. Given the profit-making nature of PLX, analysts are positive about its growth in 2024. Pullix allows users to generate passive revenue by staking the PLX altcoin.\n\nStaking basically implies locking tokens in a smart contract to strengthen the platform\u2019s liquidity. Based on the quantity and duration of staking, a reward is issued. As the period of investment increases, the profits increase, too. Pullix further presents the Market-Making Liquidity Contribution, which means that any user can act as a market maker and contribute liquidity to this platform.\n\nThe annual return paid to market makers on Pullix is between 8% and 18%. This strategy is likely to increase the number of users using Pullix, which will encourage its use. With its price now standing at $0.08 per token, Pullix is already regarded as one of the best DeFi projects to invest in 2024.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile Bitcoin ETF approval has not given the expected price movement, investors are hoping Ethereum will perform differently. Meanwhile, analysts are predicting a 100x rise in Pullix\u2019s altcoin value.\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "SEC extends spot ETH ETF decision by 45 days\n\nMore ETH flows out of exchanges as the wait begins\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has taken its first concrete step of the year on the route to either approving or rejecting an Ethereum spot ETF. This action was conveyed through a response sent by the SEC to Fidelity.\n\nSEC responds to Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application\n\nAs per a letter dated 18 January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to extend its decision-making process regarding the Fidelity spot Ethereum ETF application. The application, submitted on 17 November 2023 and opened for comments on 6 December, will now undergo an extended resolution period. This follows the SEC\u2019s choice to extend the decision timeline by 45 days.\n\nConsequently, the resolution is anticipated to be around 5 March 2024. Also, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggests that approval may be possible in May. Notably, BlackRock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink is pretty confident of the value attached to a spot Ethereum ETF. He claimed so in an interview shortly after the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nEthereum remains in a downtrend\n\nUpon the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, there was no notable surge in price, with analysts attributing this to it being priced in before the announcement. Interestingly, for Ethereum, the news of the proposal submission and the subsequent decision announcement may significantly impact the price more than the actual approval.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was trading at around $2,400, experiencing a slight loss of less than 1% in 24 hours. Although it seems to be on a downtrend, ETH\u2019s present value is higher than what its value was a year ago.\n\nAn analysis of the daily timeframe chart revealed that ETH did not reach the present price level over the previous year. Additionally, the ongoing bull trend continued while showing signs of weakening. Notably, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained above the neutral line, indicating a bullish trend at press time.\n\nObserving the exchange flow\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s examination of Ethereum\u2019s exchange flow showed that the balance between inflow and outflow shifted around 14 January. Since then, there has been a consistent trend of more outflow than inflow. This suggested that a more significant amount of ETH is leaving exchanges, compared to the incoming volume.\n\nAlso, the trend implied that fewer Ethereum assets are being offered for sale recently.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAs of 18 January, the data highlighted that over 90,000 ETH have moved out of exchanges, further supporting the notion that market participants are withdrawing their assets from exchange platforms."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShiba Inu has experienced a significant breakdown from its recent consolidation phase. The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.\n\nThe breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.\n\nThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.\n\nFor a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.\n\nThe first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.\n\nSolana paints reversal pattern\n\nSolana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.\n\nThe significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.\n\nSuch a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.\n\nThe immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.\n\nEthereum momentum decreasing\n\nEthereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.\n\nThe provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.\n\nThe 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.\n\nMarket participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey."

        "content": "ETC\u2019s price has dropped by double digits in the last week.\n\nDespite the price dip, bullish momentum remains.\n\nFollowing a post-ETF-approval rally, Ethereum Classic [ETC] has begun to shed its gains. AMBCrypto reported earlier that Ethereum-linked tokens ETC and Ethereum Name Service [ENS] climbed to 12-month highs after the long-awaited ETF decision on 10th January.\n\nAs of this writing, ETC exchanged hands at $23.90, dropping by 19% in the last week, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\nBullish momentum remains\n\nETC\u2019s price surge post-ETF approval was backed by no real uptick in demand for ETC. Now that the excitement surrounding the ETF has waned, the coin has witnessed a drop in value.\n\nHowever, despite the recent price pullback, an assessment of ETC\u2019s price movements on a daily chart revealed that bullish momentum persisted. At press time, the coin\u2019s momentum indicator rested above their respective center lines, suggesting that buying pressure exceeded coin sell-offs.\n\nFurther, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) returned a value above the zero line. When an asset\u2019s CMF value rests above zero, it signals the presence of more buying pressure.\n\nAt 0.06 and in an uptrend when writing, ETC\u2019s CMF showed rising liquidity being supplied to the coin\u2019s spot market. This is known to drive up an asset\u2019s value.\n\nConfirming the bullish trend, readings from ETC\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI) showed its positive directional index (green) resting above the negative directional index (red).\n\nWhen these trend lines are positioned in this manner, it suggests that the strength of the bulls exceeds that of the bears.\n\nHowever, the price decline experienced in the last week has resulted in a fall in ETC\u2019s futures open interest. According to data from Coinglass, since 12th January, ETC\u2019s open interest has plunged by 22%.\n\nAs of this writing, the coin\u2019s futures open interest was $162.34\n\nVolatility lingers in the market\n\nThe hike in ETC price post-ETF approval led to a surge in market volatility.\n\nWith the gap between the upper and lower bands of the coin\u2019s Bollinger Bands (BB) indicator still widening at press time, ETC remained prone to price swings."

        "content": "As the weekend unfolds, Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a notable uptick, trading at $41,700 with nearly 1.40% increase on Saturday. Despite this positive momentum, skepticism remains as The New York Times maintains a cautious stance on Bitcoin\u2019s prospects. Adding to the wary outlook, the RBI Governor has flagged cryptocurrencies as a risk to the stability of the Indian Rupee, urging investors to proceed with caution.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has reported a loss of $2.3 million by the cryptocurrency exchange Debiex due to alleged romance scams, highlighting the vulnerabilities within the crypto space. Furthermore, the strength of the US Dollar Index (DXY) is seen as a potential threat to Bitcoin\u2019s recovery, compounded by the selling pressure from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nWith such diverse factors at play, investors are pondering whether it\u2019s the opportune moment to buy into Bitcoin and Ethereum as the latter taps the $2,500 mark.\n\nRBI Governor Cautions: Cryptocurrency Threatens Rupee Stability\n\n\n\nGovernor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Shaktikanta Das, has spoken about the serious risks that come with cryptocurrencies, particularly for developing nations. Das underlined the possible effects on the monetary system, currency stability, and financial stability. He voiced worries about cryptocurrencies\u2019 lack of underlying assets and their ability to replace money in payment systems and banking.\n\nDas highlights the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies and sees considerable risks, even in spite of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission having approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The governor\u2019s cautious approach increases the regulatory obstacles that cryptocurrencies must overcome and may lead to more volatility in the market.\n\nCFTC Reports: Debiex Exchange Hit by $2.3M Romance Scams\n\n\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has labeled cryptocurrency exchange Debiex as a \u201cfraudulent digital asset platform,\u201d accusing its senior staff of orchestrating romantic deceptions to defraud money.\n\nCFTC Charges Bogus Digital Asset Platform with Fraud and Misappropriation in an Online Romance Scam: https://t.co/RpskNapy7i \u2014 CFTC (@CFTC) January 19, 2024\n\nThe CFTC\u2019s report alleges that Debiex representatives engaged in forming intimate relationships with potential clients, gaining their trust, and subsequently persuading them to open and fund trading accounts. This scheme reportedly siphoned over $2 million, with five victims currently identified over two years.\n\nThese romance scam allegations add to a series of challenges within the cryptocurrency industry, potentially impacting investor sentiment and activity by undermining the trust and credibility of crypto exchanges.\n\nUS Dollar Rally and GBTC Sell-Off Endanger Bitcoin\u2019s Recovery\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index\u2019s (DXY) rally, up 2.71% from its December 27 low, poses a challenge to Bitcoin\u2019s price recovery. Bolstered by robust retail sales and positive economic data, the DXY has seen significant gains. Concurrently, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has experienced substantial outflows, with around 38,000 BTC withdrawn since January 11, when spot Bitcoin ETFs were introduced.\n\nEconomist Peter Schiff attributes these GBTC outflows as a key factor preventing Bitcoin\u2019s price rise. Technical analysis suggests Bitcoin could potentially fall back to around $34,000, having been repelled at the $48,000 level, which aligns with the upper limit of an ascending parallel channel."

It probably has something to do with investors cashing out their gains from the initial ETF hype.\n\nSome analysts said that ETF approval had already been \"priced in.\" This likely means that traders and investors were unlikely to continue buying after the approval was made official.\n\nThe rest of the crypto market has been hit hard over the past week, too. Solana (SOL) has shed over 7% of its value in the past week and is priced at $92.38.\n\nWhile Avalanche (AVAX) is down by more than 14%, trading hands for $32.82. Both assets had done very well in December as they attracted institutional investor interest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH), the second-biggest digital coin, has lost 8% of its value in the past week. It's now priced at $2,466.\n\nFollowing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of 10 spot BTC ETFs, the crypto sphere is now awaiting spot ETH ETFs to drop.\n\nWall Street's top regulator on Thursday pushed back its deadline for a decision on Fidelity's proposed spot Ethereum ETF to March 5, leading to a price dip in the asset.\n\nThe entire crypto market now stands at $1.7 trillion, having dropped by 2.8% in the last 24 hours."

Crucial breakout above 0.00045 BTC, if that breaks, a run to 0.0008-0.001 BTC seems next.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader suggests that LINK/BTC is on the verge of a trend reversal and about to break through a key resistance level at 0.0004480 BTC ($18.63).\n\nLINK/BTC is trading for 0.0003741 BTC ($15.59) at time of writing.\n\nThe trader also weighs in on Bitcoin as the crypto king dipped to the low $40,000s this week. He believes Bitcoin is in the early stages of a bull market cycle and wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a correction to the $36,000 level.\n\n\u201cBitcoin isn\u2019t into a bear market; it\u2019s at the start of a new bull cycle.

Chat GPT predicts a resurgence in SOL\u2019s value, considering its technical robustness and growing adoption.Solana\u2019s ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second positions it as a preferred choice for DeFi and NFT projects. This advantage could drive SOL\u2019s price upwards, potentially reaching the $200 mark, a significant increase from its current standing.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Progressive Outlook\n\nEthereum, the leading smart contract platform, is expected to continue its dominance, especially with its upcoming Ethereum Cancun upgrade. This upgrade, anticipated to increase scalability and efficiency significantly, is likely to draw more users and developers to the platform, bolstering ETH\u2019s price. Chat GPT foresees Ethereum potentially breaking past its previous all-time high, with a price target hovering around $5,000 by the end of 2024.While Solana and Ethereum have their strengths, Retik Finance is emerging as a formidable contender in the DeFi space. Priced attractively at $0.08, Retik Finance is not just another token in the crypto market; it\u2019s a revolution in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK): A New Era in DeFi\n\nDespite the promising outlook for SOL and ETH, Retik Finance is emerging as a potential market leader, offering groundbreaking innovations in DeFi. Recently audited by Certik and listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, Retik Finance is gaining credibility and visibility in the crypto space.\n\nWhy Retik Finance Stands Out\n\nRetik Finance is revolutionising DeFi with its comprehensive suite of products, including DeFi debit cards, a next-gen payment gateway, AI-powered P2P lending, and a highly secure multi-chain DeFi wallet. These offerings are not just technological advancements but also practical solutions that address real-world financial challenges, bridging the gap between cryptocurrencies and everyday transactions.\n\nCertik Audit \u2013 A Testament to Security and Reliability\n\nThe Certik audit of Retik Finance underscores the platform\u2019s commitment to security and reliability. This audit provides an additional layer of trust and confidence for investors, ensuring that Retik Finance\u2019s smart contracts are robust and secure against potential vulnerabilities.\n\n2024: The Year of Retik Finance\n\nChat GPT\u2019s analysis suggests that 2024 could very well be the year of Retik Finance. With its innovative features and growing ecosystem, RETIK is projected to experience substantial growth, potentially outperforming both Solana and Ethereum.\n\nRobust Features and Market Appeal: Retik Finance\u2019s array of features, particularly its DeFi debit cards, are set to transform how people interact with cryptocurrencies. These cards will facilitate the widespread adoption of crypto in everyday transactions, a significant leap towards mainstream acceptance.\n\nAI-Powered Lending \u2013 A Game-Changer: The platform\u2019s introduction of AI-powered P2P lending is a significant innovation in the DeFi space. This feature is expected to attract a broad user base, offering a more accessible and efficient lending and borrowing mechanism.\n\nMarket Confidence and Adoption: Retik Finance\u2019s presence on prominent platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, coupled with its Certik audit, is building market confidence. These factors contribute to a growing investor base eagerly anticipating the platform\u2019s full launch.\n\nBold Price Predictions for Retik Finance\n\nLooking at Retik Finance\u2019s trajectory and market potential, Chat GPT predicts a remarkable performance in 2024. The platform is expected to provide substantial returns for early investors, with a price prediction indicating a surge of over 900% from its current value. This growth is not just based on market speculation but also on the tangible utility and innovation Retik Finance brings to the DeFi landscape.\n\nConclusion: A Transformative Year Ahead\n\nAs 2024 unfolds, the cryptocurrency market is set for a transformative journey. While Solana and Ethereum are predicted to see significant growth, Retik Finance is poised to make a more substantial impact. With its innovative solutions, Certik audit, and listings on key crypto platforms, Retik Finance is not just another token in the crowded crypto space; it\u2019s a harbinger of change in DeFi. For investors and enthusiasts alike, Retik Finance represents an opportunity not just for substantial financial returns but also to be part of a revolution in decentralized finance.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance"

        "content": "Grok, an artificial intelligence (AI) developed by xAI under Elon Musk\u2019s guidance, has quickly gained popularity on X (formerly Twitter) and in the crypto world. The model processes diverse data streams and has real-time analysis of X\u2019s user-generated content.\n\nPreviously, Grok made waves by choosing an ideal cryptocurrency for payments on X.\n\nIn the meantime, cryptocurrencies are getting ready for what could be a brewing bull market. Investors are managing their portfolios, looking for the best opportunities and value asymmetry to invest in 2024.\n\nFinbold turned to Grok, seeking valuable insights on three recommended cryptocurrencies for three different investment profiles. Particularly, we asked xAI\u2019s model to pick one cryptocurrency for a conservative, aggressive, and very aggressive investor.\n\nGrok picks Ethereum (ETH) for conservative investors\n\nFirst, Grok named Ethereum (ETH) as the ideal investment for a conservative cryptocurrency profile in 2024. The AI forecasts a fair value of $8,000 to $10,000 for ETH, which justifies its pick.\n\n\u201cEthereum is a well-established and widely adopted platform with strong fundamentals and a large developer community. The successful implementation of Ethereum 2.0 and the continued growth of DeFi and NFT projects on the Ethereum network could drive its value higher.\u201d \u2014 Grok, by xAI\n\nGrok picks Ethereum (ETH) for conservative investors. Source: Finbold\n\nElon Musk\u2019s AI names Polkadot (DOT) to invest in 2024\n\nMeanwhile, aggressive investors should look at Polkadot (DOT) and a price range of $200 to $300 in 2024.\n\n\u201cPolkadot is a promising interoperability platform that enables cross-chain communication and transactions. With its strong development team, growing ecosystem, and potential to become a critical infrastructure for the next generation of blockchain projects, it could see significant growth in the coming years.\u201d \u2014 Grok, by xAI\n\nGrok picks Polkadot (DOT) for aggressive investors. Source: Finbold\n\nChainlink (LINK) is for the very aggressive investors, according to Grok\n\nFinally, Grok names Chainlink (LINK) as the right pick for very aggressive speculators looking for higher risks. LINK is expected to reach the price range of $150 to $250 per token, according to the AI.\n\n\u201cChainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides real-world data to smart contracts. As the demand for reliable off-chain data in DeFi and other blockchain applications continues to grow, Chainlink\u2019s adoption and value could increase significantly.\u201d \u2014 Grok, by xAI\n\nGrok picks Chainlink (LINK) for aggressive investors. Source: Finbold\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, three different types of investors could benefit from deploying capital to Ethereum, Polkadot, and Chainlink, according to Grok. Notably, each project focus on different use cases like Web3 infrastructure, cross-chain solutions, and real-world data oracles, respectively.\n\nNevertheless, Grok warned for the speculative nature of its predictions and that \u201cthe cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and unpredictable.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the crypto market enters 2024, Ethereum (ETH) and Stellar (XLM) are experiencing mixed trends,\n\nInQubeta (QUBE), an innovative AI cryptocurrency ICO, is gaining momentum in January, 2024.\n\nSupporters of InQubeta (QUBE) can take part in pre-sale and buy tokens here.\n\nEthereum (ETH might be due to healthy correction\n\nEthereum, the second best cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently undergone a notable correction, retreating to key support levels. Despite this downturn, Ethereum has shown signs of resilience, indicating a potential resurgence from a lower level. Technical indicators paint a mixed picture; the Hourly MACD reveals diminishing bullish momentum, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ETH/USD hovers just above the equilibrium point of 50. This suggests a degree of hesitation in the market, reflecting the uncertainty and fluctuating investor sentiment.\n\nStellar (XLM) community remains strongly optimistic\n\nStarting 2024 on a bearish note, Stellar has struggled to maintain or boost its price since December. Investors who hoped for a positive change in price trajectory with the new year have been disappointed, as Stellar records a decline in price value.\n\nAdditionally, trading volumes for Stellar have been decreasing, contributing to the negative sentiment surrounding the token. Experts anticipate that Stellar may break out of its bearish form in the coming weeks, but the current trend indicates a period of challenge for this top altcoin.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) pre-sale gains momentum\n\nInQubeta emerges as a beacon of positive momentum in the crypto space. This platform, powered by its QUBE token, is starting to turn heads in the investment world, especially among those keen on the growing intersection of AI and crypto. What makes InQubeta stand out is how it's making it simpler for everyday investors to get into AI startups. With QUBE tokens, fractional investments are possible, opening up a field that was mostly played by the big guns.\n\nOn the InQubeta platform, AI startups have the opportunity to create popular NFTs that represent either rewards or a stake in their company. This offers investors a variety of direct ways to invest, which is pretty exciting. It's a win-win: startups get the funding they need, and investors have the chance to benefit from the success of these innovative AI ventures.\n\nThe QUBE token is at the heart of all this. It's a deflationary ERC20 coin, and it's got a unique approach where each transaction gets a 2% tax that goes to a burn wallet. Plus, there's a 5% tax that's set aside as a reward for those holding their coins.\n\nInQubeta, a new ICO, is tapping into what's hot right now: investments in AI startups. If we take a leaf out of crypto history, QUBE, InQubeta's token, could be gearing up to be a major player in the next bull run. It's this kind of potential and excitement that keeps the crypto arena interesting and full of surprises.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities"

He keeps a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. Whether he's trading or writing, Sohrab always keeps his finger on the pulse of the crypto world, using his expertise to deliver informative and engaging articles that educate and inspire. When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nStory Highlights ETC price action shows a retest phase of a bullish breakout of the consolidation range in the weekly chart.\n\nThe range breakout ends the long-term lower-high formations and marks a trend reversal.\n\nAs per the Fibonacci levels in the weekly chart, the reversal trend can reach the $40 mark.\n\nFollowing the impressive recovery of 37% last week, the ETC price shows a minor pullback this week. With a 6.47% decline, the minor pullback humbles the Ethereum Classic buyers and retests the breakout level.\n\nWith the weekly chart signaling an overall trend reversal spark getting brighter in the ETC price trend, the retest comes as an entry spot. Moreover, our ETC price prediction aligns with the trend reversal possibility as we expect a bull run for Ethereum Classic in 2024.\n\nSource \u2013 Tradingview\n\nETC Price Prepares A Takeoff Beyond $30\n\nIn the daily chart, the recent correction marks a quick retest of the 50-day EMA and the 38.20% Fibonacci level. However, the increased demand at lower levels pushes the Ethereum Classic price higher back with a long-tail bullish candle.\n\nFurther, an uptick in the trading volume supports the idea of a bullish comeback to conclude the ongoing retest. Currently, the ETC price trades at $24.82 and shows a 2.05% drop, resulting in a new bear candle, teasing a sideways shift above $24.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nStochastic RSI: The K and D lines in the stochastic RSI maintain a declining slope and approach the oversold boundary. Hence, a bounceback is possible as the lines may soon reverse from the oversold.\n\nEMA: In the daily chart, the 50-day EMA reflects a dynamic solid support ready to absorb overhead supply.\n\nWill Ethereum Classic Price Reach $40?\n\nFollowing the impressive reversal last night from the confluence of supports at $24, the Ethereum Classic sustains the uptrend. In addition, the weekly chart reflects a potential trend reversal with the range breakout.\n\nHence, the technical chart signals an entry opportunity for sideline traders in both weekly and daily charts.\n\nIf the buyers manage to lift the uptrend, the ETC price may break past $30 to reach $40 shortly. However, if ETC fails to maintain its momentum, it may break the $24 level to test the $20 mark."

        "content": "Table of Contents\n\nAs Bitcoin steadily climbs, it boosts the whole crypto scene's confidence, nudging investors to take a shot at altcoins with their higher risk but tantalizing potential. Bitcoin's market dominance has declined by 6% since the ETFs' introduction, also indicating a growing interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. Experts hint we might be on the cusp of an 'altseason' where these under-the-radar cryptos start stealing the spotlight with their rising value: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Xai (XAI).\n\nRide The Wave Of Innovation With ScapesMania\n\nAs the ScapesMania presale nears its completion in February, the team is working hard to secure a quick listing on tier-1 exchange platforms.

Be quick if you want to get your hands on those lucrative tokens before they're all gone.\n\nPresale Closing Soon \u2013 Seize Opportunities Now!\n\nEthereum (ETH): Navigating the ETF Approval Landscape\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently experiencing a significant shift in narrative due to speculation about a potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the USA. While an Ethereum spot ETF could potentially boost altcoin prices, it's prudent to temper expectations and invest judiciously. The market is closely monitoring the upcoming Bitcoin halving and the U.S. presidential election, both of which could significantly impact Ethereum's (ETH) trajectory.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price has been fluctuating within a range of $2,188 to $2,736. The 10-day Moving Average is at $2,493, while the 100-day Moving Average is at $2,418. Key support levels are identified at $1,357 and $1,904, with resistance levels emerging at $3,000 and $3,548.\n\nShould regulators approve an Ethereum ETF, the token\u2019s price will probably soar. However, the influence of global events and broader economic trends cannot be overlooked \u2013 the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the USA, possibly affected by the presidential election's outcome, could also impact Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum's (ETH) future price movement is likely to be shaped by these external factors, as well as its own technological advancements and adoption rate.\n\nSolana (SOL): Riding the Altcoin Season Wave\n\nSolana (SOL) is gaining recognition as a prominent player in the emerging altcoin season \u2013. the Altcoin Season Index recently exceeded the critical threshold of 75, signaling the start of this period. Known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, Solana (SOL) has demonstrated a notable price increase and is now forming a bullish pattern on its chart.\n\nThe current price range for Solana (SOL) is between $64.84 and $132.36. The 10-day Moving Average lies at $96.62 and the 100-day Moving Average stands at $65.74. Solana (SOL) has support at $27.97 and faces resistance at $163.01 and $230.54.\n\nSolana's (SOL) performance during the altcoin season and its technical indicators suggest a bullish outlook. However, the volatile nature of the crypto market should not be underestimated \u2013 significant gains are possible, but so are losses. The sustainability of this momentum and Solana's (SOL) ability to reach new heights will be closely monitored by the community.\n\nXai (XAI): The Rising Star in Gaming Cryptocurrency\n\nXai's (XAI) recent price surge is attributed to several key developments: an airdrop that distributed free coins, listings on major exchanges like BNB, and a strong presence in the gaming world's digital currency scene. With a blockchain designed for the gaming community, Xai (XAI) aims to address common challenges faced by gamers online.\n\nXai (XAI) is currently nestled between $0.93 and $1.124. The 10-day Moving Average sits at $0.87 and the 100-Day Moving Average hovers at $0.97. Support levels are set at $0.67 and $0.85, with resistance levels looming at $1.22 and $1.41.\n\nXai's (XAI) near-term prospects appear promising given its recent airdrop and new exchange listings that provided a significant boost. However, to prosper in the long run, Xai (XAI) has to sustain its momentum and capitalize on the potential of the gaming sector. If it innovatively integrates blockchain with gaming and creates new ways to share games, the Xai (XAI) token stands a great chance of growing and succeeding.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has notably influenced the crypto market, particularly benefiting Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Xai (XAI) and heralding the beginning of an 'altseason' \u2013 a period during which alternative cryptocurrencies gain in value and prominence. Ethereum (ETH) is poised for growth with the potential of an ETF approval, Solana (SOL) is capitalizing on its technical strengths during the altcoin season, and Xai (XAI) is emerging as a significant player in the gaming cryptocurrency sector. Their future price action depends on several factors which are tech developments, market adoption, and broader economic and regulatory events.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Defines L2s on Celestia as Validiums, Not Rollups - CryptoDaily",
        "content": "Ethereum Foundation co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently weighed in on the classification of the blockchain's Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions and declared that validiums associated with Ethereum should not be confused with genuine rollup solutions.\n\nThe discussion gained momentum this week, when Ethereum enthusiast and Soul Wallet co-founder Zeng Jiajun noted that ethereum.org and Buterin define \"Layer 2 = rollup\" and added that \"if one uses any other chain (Celestia, for example) as DA [data availability], it is a Celestia L2.\"\n\nButerin agreed with Daniel Wang, the founder of Taiko, an Ethereum rollup solution, who suggested that Ethereum rollups relying on external data chains for data availability, like Celestia, should be classified as validiums.\n\nThis is correct.\n\n\n\nThe core of being a rollup is the unconditional security guarantee: you can get your assets out even if everyone else colludes against you. Can't get that if DA is dependent on an external system.\n\n\n\nBut being a validium is a correct choice for many apps, and\u2026 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 16, 2024\n\nButerin shared the defining feature of rollups, stating that \"the core of being a rollup is the unconditional security guarantee: you can get your assets out even if everyone else colludes against you.\" He also pointed out the inherent security risks when data availability (DA) is dependent on an external system and recognized that a validium is a viable choice for many applications. He suggested that implementing robust, distributed DA systems could significantly bolster the practical security of a validium.\n\nValidiums, as defined by ethereum.org, are a scaling solution for Ethereum that enhances transaction processing capacity by allowing off-chain transactions through zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs while relying on the blockchain's mainnet for verification processes and security. Unlike rollups, validiums bypass storing all transaction data to an L1, boosting scalability by limiting on-chain data storage.\n\nValidiums also introduce reliance on third-party operators for accurate proof postings, potentially impacting data availability, a challenge less prevalent in rollups. Validiums are crucial in balancing transaction speed and privacy in systems like Celestia's modular blockchain.\n\n\n\nCelestia uses a modular design, differing from Ethereum's architecture, by separating data availability and validation into distinct layers. This structure offers customizable data availability and independent validation layer deployment.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, Ryan Berckmans, a member of the Ethereum community and the founder of Ethereum payments app 3cities, challenges Buterin's view. Berckmans commented that validiums should be considered L2 networks, arguing that a Layer 2 chain is defined by its settlement on Ethereum, not by the location of its data availability. He emphasizes the industry's flexibility in still being able to define 'L2' and suggests a more inclusive definition encompassing both rollups and validiums. Berckmans also references L2Beat, a platform tracking the adoption of layer-2 protocols, which currently includes validiums in its L2 lists.\n\nYes, but validiums are L2s.\n\n\n\nThis is a new industry, we can define \"L2\" to mean whatever we want.\n\n\n\nThe maximally useful definition of L2 includes both rollups and validiums.\n\n\n\nThat's why L2Beat lists validiums today.\n\n\n\nL2 = rollup or validium https://t.co/WwtkAV2sAE \u2014 Ryan Berckmans ryanb.eth (@ryanberckmans) January 16, 2024\n\nL2Beat's website, however, states that validiums are not L2s: \"by not publishing data on L1 they introduce additional trust assumptions on top of it. If the data to reconstruct the state is not made available by the operators of the off-chain DA solution, funds are at risk.\" So L2Beat considers validiums to fall outside the scope of traditional rollup-style L2 solutions.\n\n\"We include Validiums and Optimiums along with L2s mainly for historical reasons. We introduced them when the L2 space was still in its infancy and we wanted to provide a comprehensive overview of the space. We will continue to track these projects to provide the community with a broader perspective on the state of the space and to provide tools to evaluate the different tradeoffs between the various solutions.\"\n\nAlthough there is still debate over whether a validium should fall under the L2 umbrella, Vitalik clearly sees the structure as something separate."

        "title": "Ethereum Boss Unleashes: Buterin Blasts Crypto Firms For 'Foundational Sin' - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Renowned Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin, has ignited a fervent debate within the crypto industry, urging stakeholders to prioritize transparency and accountability. Drawing attention to recent governance challenges, Buterin\u2019s insights shed light on a critical need for open dialogue and the industry\u2019s responsibility to rectify its past missteps.\n\nEthereum Founder: Address Crypto Industry\u2019s Governance Issues\n\nButerin\u2019s reflections were prompted by two prominent incidents that have rattled the crypto sphere: the controversy surrounding Sam Bankman-Fried and governance issues within the OpenAI board. However, his focus extends beyond these specific cases, delving into the broader challenges faced by the tech and crypto sectors.\n\nCentral to Buterin\u2019s argument is the call to address the industry\u2019s governance shortcomings, which he refers to as a \u201cfoundational sin.\u201d He emphasizes that the core issue lies not only in the controversial actions themselves but also in the lack of transparent and accountable dialogue with the public. This failure to foster trust and engagement has far-reaching consequences for the industry\u2019s credibility and long-term sustainability.\n\nI feel like my response survived ok: my main critique in both cases was \u201crespect public legitimacy more\u201d (Sam\u2019s sin was the fraud plus the \u201cwoke shibboleths\u201d thing, the OpenAI board\u2019s sin was making a sudden huge decision and feeling entitled to not explain itself to the public) \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 20, 2024\n\nThe FTX scandal serves as a timely example of the consequences of this foundational sin. Buterin underscores the importance of substantiated evidence before passing swift judgment on high-ranking CEOs involved in deceptive behavior. The absence of a governing board at FTX highlights the critical need for robust oversight mechanisms to ensure checks and balances within corporate structures.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,409 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nButerin: Rectify \u2018Foundational Sin\u2019\n\nButerin\u2019s astute analysis examines the intricacies of corporate governance, especially within the ever-evolving ethereum and crypto landscape. He argues that rectifying the industry\u2019s foundational sin requires a paradigm shift that values public trust and legitimacy. Instances like Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s fraudulent activities and the opaque decision-making process at OpenAI serve as cautionary tales, exposing the pressing need for improved governance practices in the tech and crypto sectors.\n\nThe key question arises: How can crypto companies restore trust, transparency, and accountability? Buterin proposes a governance model that not only complies with legal mandates but also genuinely engages with the community. By fostering open dialogue and involving stakeholders, companies can rebuild public trust and address the industry\u2019s governance challenges head-on.\n\nWhile the Ethereum founder\u2019s vision has garnered support from many quarters, skeptics question the practicality of implementing such a governance model in the complex crypto landscape.\n\nAs the crypto industry grapples with these profound challenges, the discussions ignited by Buterin\u2019s insights on transparency and accountability have become pivotal to its evolution.\n\nFeatured image from Getty Images"

        "content": "Despite facing market declines, Cardano surpasses Ethereum in large transactions, with daily volumes reaching $13 billion.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA price dropped by 2.56% to $0.5177, while Ethereum saw a milder 0.85% decrease to $2,516.35 in the past 24 hours.\n\nCardano (ADA) has recently outpaced Ethereum (ETH) in large transaction volumes. Data from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock (ITB) reveals that Cardano\u2019s 30-day volume of large transactions, defined as those exceeding $100,000 in fiat value, significantly surpasses Ethereum\u2019s. This development emerges as the crypto market attempts to navigate through a bearish phase.\n\nCardano whales have been quite active for the past few months. $13B in large transactions (>$100k) is being settled on Cardano daily on average. A significant amount, if you compare it to Ethereum's $5B 7-day average. pic.twitter.com/8rjeQZaonU \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 18, 2024\n\nCardano, known for its scientific approach to blockchain development and a strong focus on sustainability, has seen its market price and capitalization dip by 4% in the past 24 hours, at $0.5 and $17 billion respectively. In contrast, Ethereum, the industry\u2019s foremost smart contract network, has experienced a milder decline of 1.96% in the same period, with its price adjusting to $2,487.35.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Position in the Market\n\nWith a slower growth rate, Ethereum holds its position, while Cardano shows a strong influx of large transactions. According to IntoTheBlock data, the weekly average of Ethereum\u2019s huge transactions\u2014mostly those made by market whales\u2014is approximately $5 billion. Ethereum\u2019s transaction volume has, however, recently increased. Over the past 24 hours, it has increased by 6.74% to $4.16 billion. This increase contrasts Cardano\u2019s higher volume, currently at $11.24 billion but has dropped 8.74% in the same period.\n\nEthereum continues to be a major force in the cryptocurrency market, having been the first to develop smart contract technology and spur the emergence of decentralized apps (dApps). It continuously upgrades to a proof-of-stake consensus process to address scalability and environmental concerns, factors crucial to its long-term viability.\n\nThe competition between Layer-1 networks like Ethereum and Cardano reflects the larger dynamics in the cryptocurrency market. To have the Cardano protocol surpass Ethereum in market valuation is one of the community\u2019s aspirational goals. This objective seems far-fetched, though, given that Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization is $302,549,903,898 while Cardano\u2019s is only $903,898.\n\nCardano\u2019s immediate focus may be leveraging its current strengths, including the recent surge in whale transaction volume and its ongoing developer activity. These factors play a crucial role in establishing Cardano as a strong competitor in the blockchain market, which could challenge Ethereum\u2019s established dominance.\n\nThe Bearish Sentiment and Future Prospects\n\nThe prevailing bearish sentiment in the crypto market has impacted both Cardano and Ethereum, albeit in different magnitudes. ADA has recently fallen below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a critical market sentiment indicator. This drop is typically considered a bearish signal, often leading to further declines or a market consolidation period. The significance of this drop lies in the combination of high transaction volumes with ADA\u2019s negative price action, raising questions about the long-term strategies of large-scale investors in Cardano.\n\nDespite these challenges, Cardano\u2019s community remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, especially in its ambition to surpass Ethereum in market capitalization. However, with Cardano\u2019s market cap currently at $18.3 billion, significantly lower than Ethereum\u2019s $302.5 billion, this goal appears more aspirational in the current market context.\n\n."

This strategic move marks an expansion of presence across diverse decentralized and centralized exchanges (DEXs and CEXs). The latest addition is being added on the widely recognized Uniswap platform.\n\nToken Deployment and Seamless Transfers: AirDAO Enhancing User Experience on Ethereum\n\nThe smart contract for the AMB token on the Ethereum network has undergone deployment. It has been done in order to ensure a transparent and verified environment for users engaging in Uniswap transactions. Come January 22, 2024, the AMB/wETH pair will go live on Uniswap. This pair will be providing users with the opportunity to seamlessly trade the AMB token for ETH.\n\nMoreover, for the esteemed AMB-Net users, the bridge to Ethereum is now open. It will allow for a smooth transfer of AMB tokens to Ethereum starting January 22, 2024. It\u2019s important to note that the transfer process is anticipated to take approximately 24 hours.\n\nFees and Expansion \u2013 Navigating Costs for AMB Token Transition to Ethereum\n\nTo facilitate this transition, AirDAO has now introduced nominal fees to cover the services provided. Users will incur a Network Fee, payable in AMB tokens, when transferring from AMB-NET to Ethereum. The cost is contingent on the prevailing Ethereum network transaction fees, typically around $20. Additionally, a symbolic 0.3% fee for transactions of $100,000 or less has been implemented as a bridge fee. For transactions exceeding this amount, the fee is reduced to 0.1%.\n\nTrending Now: Huobi Initiates Transition from HT TOKEN to HTX TOKEN\n\nThis expansion represents a significant stride in AirDAO\u2019s journey, empowering the whole community to seamlessly interact with the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly on the Uniswap platform. AirDAO is enthusiastic about the potential opportunities this brings for the community and eagerly anticipates an exciting future filled with decentralized possibilities."

        "content": "In a recent development, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opted to prolong its assessment of Fidelity\u2019s application for a spot Ethereum ETF. This decision, conveyed through a letter to Fidelity dated January 18, 2024, marks a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency landscape, prompting industry watchers to contemplate potential parallels with the journey of Bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nThe application, initially submitted on November 17, 2023, and open for public comments since December 6, will now undergo an extended evaluation process, with the resolution expected around March 5, 2024. Notably, this 45-day extension has fueled speculation, with Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggesting that approval might materialize in May. BlackRock\u2019s CEO, Larry Fink, expressing confidence in the value of a spot Ethereum ETF, added weight to the conversation, noting the significance of such a development shortly after the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhile the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF failed to trigger a notable surge in prices, Ethereum, on the other hand, might experience a more pronounced response to both the proposal submission and the eventual decision. The cryptocurrency, currently trading around $2,400, has witnessed a minor loss of less than 1% in the last 24 hours. Despite this apparent downtrend, Ethereum\u2019s current value surpasses its worth from a year ago.\n\nAnalyzing the daily timeframe chart, it becomes evident that ETH did not reach its present price level over the past year. The ongoing bull trend, while displaying signs of weakening, remains evident, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicating a bullish trend at press time by remaining above the neutral line.\n\nThe impact on Ethereum\u2019s market trends is being closely monitored. Unlike Bitcoin, where the ETF approval had a minimal immediate effect on prices, Ethereum\u2019s market may be more responsive to the news of the proposal submission and subsequent decision. As of the latest update, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at approximately $2,400, reflecting a marginal loss of less than 1% in the last 24 hours. Despite the current downtrend, Ethereum\u2019s value remains higher than its position a year ago.\n\nAnalyzing the daily timeframe chart for ETH/USD, it becomes evident that the present price level was not reached over the past year. However, the ongoing bull trend shows signs of weakening, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remaining above the neutral line, indicating a prevailing bullish trend.\n\nExamining the exchange flow of Ethereum, it is notable that the balance between inflow and outflow shifted around January 14. Since then, a consistent trend of more outflows than inflows has emerged. This suggests a significant amount of ETH is leaving exchanges, with fewer Ethereum assets available for sale recently. This dynamic in exchange flow could potentially impact the cryptocurrency\u2019s market dynamics in the coming weeks.\n\nTaking a closer look at Ethereum\u2019s exchange flow, a recent examination by AMBCrypto reveals a noteworthy shift in the balance between inflow and outflow around January 14. Since then, a consistent trend has emerged, indicating more outflow than inflow. This suggests a substantial amount of ETH is leaving exchanges, while the incoming volume remains comparatively lower. Furthermore, this trend implies a reduction in the number of Ethereum assets available for sale in recent times.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency community awaits the SEC\u2019s decision, the impact on Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics and valuation remains a focal point of discussion. While the spot Bitcoin ETF approval did not lead to an immediate surge in prices, Ethereum\u2019s unique circumstances and the increasing outflows from exchanges raise questions about how the market will react.\n\nPotential investors and enthusiasts are advised to stay vigilant, as the SEC\u2019s decision holds the potential to reshape Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in the coming months. Whether the market will witness a surge in prices following approval or if the current trends in exchange flows will continue, only time will tell.\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets, regulatory decisions play a crucial role in shaping market sentiment. As Ethereum enthusiasts and investors eagerly await the outcome of the SEC\u2019s review, the cryptocurrency market is poised for a period of heightened anticipation and speculation."
