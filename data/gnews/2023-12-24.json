        "content": "Seasoned trader Peter Brandt says he\u2019s no longer expecting the leading altcoin Ethereum (ETH) go on a big move to the downside.\n\nLast week, Brandt told his 707,300 followers on the social media platform X that he was shorting Ethereum, predicting that ETH could tumble to as low as $650.\n\nIn an update, the veteran trader says that circumstances have changed and he\u2019s no longer bearish on the top altcoin as ETH has managed to move above the resistance of an ascending triangle pattern.\n\n\u201cStrong opinions, weakly held. When circumstances change, my opinion changes.\n\nMy recent appraisal of ETH called for an immediate price collapse \u2013 that has not happened. I have withdrawn my bearish outlook based on chart structure.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $2,316, still above the pattern\u2019s resistance.\n\nLooking at Ethereum rival Solana (SOL), the seasoned analyst says that while the altcoin has already met his upside target, it is still within the realm of possibility for the coin to continue going up.\n\n\u201cThe log scale target of $86.48 of Solana SOL/USD has been met. Of course, prices can trend well beyond target levels.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Solana is trading for $111.55, up about 56% in the last seven days.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A crypto strategist who nailed the top of the Bitcoin (BTC) bull market in 2021 believes that one Ethereum (ETH) scaling solution that\u2019s trading under the radar will see a burst to the upside.\n\nPseudonymous crypto strategist Pentoshi tells his 727,200 followers on the social media platform X that he\u2019s bullish on Arbitrum (ARB).\n\nAccording to the analyst, ARB will likely receive a shot in the arm if it manages to take out its immediate resistance at $1.70.\n\n\u201cI think it needs to get over $1.70 to really get anyone excited. Has a great shot at trading up there near term.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ARB is trading for $1.38.\n\nThe analyst is also keeping an eye on Injective (INJ), a decentralized exchange that aims to offer a variety of financial products including spot trading and futures. According to Pentoshi, it\u2019s clear skies for INJ as there is no resistance left to stop the altcoin from price discovery.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the craziest charts in the entire space, and currently in price discovery. So right now it\u2019s clear skies. I don\u2019t know if you get it, but I think under $30 is a buy if given the chance.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, INJ is trading for $42.14.\n\nThe analyst is also looking at Optimism (OP), another layer-2 altcoin. According to Pentoshi, OP also has no known resistance left after breaking its recent all-time high at around $3.29.\n\n\u201cAbout to begin price discovery\u2026 Often around discovery is a great time to buy as it\u2019s likely to have continuation after some consolidation.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, OP is worth $3.42.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum has seen an 85% increase in market cap in 2023. While this growth is substantial, it slightly underperforms compared to other major assets in the blockchain space. Despite the much-anticipated upgrades, ETF applications and robust adoption metrics, Ethereum faces a critical challenge that undermines its competitive edge: its Layer 1 (L1) scalability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe scalability issues and high transaction fees of Ethereum's L1 have stifled the growth potential of its DeFi ecosystem. While Ethereum has long been the leading platform for decentralized applications, its inability to efficiently scale has led to exorbitant fees and slower transaction times, causing frustration for both developers and regular users.\n\nEthereum grew ~85% in market cap in 2023, slightly underperforming other major assets despite upgrades, ETF applications and showing robust adoption metrics. pic.twitter.com/cdvV085cxz \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 23, 2023\n\nOn the other hand, Solana has been making significant strides, boasting a growth pace that starkly outshines Ethereum. With its promise of high throughput and low transaction costs, Solana is rapidly gaining traction. It has positioned itself as a more scalable and cost-effective blockchain, attracting a burgeoning number of DeFi projects and users. This has allowed Solana to carve out a substantial market share, positioning itself as a formidable competitor to Ethereum.\n\nSimilarly, networks like Avalanche have demonstrated the critical importance of scalability in the blockchain trifecta of decentralization, security and scalability. Avalanche's growth has been bolstered by its high-performance capabilities, which cater to the demands of modern-day applications seeking swift and affordable transactions.\n\nThe scaling issue looms large over Ethereum's future prospects. If not addressed with urgency and efficiency, Ethereum risks losing its pioneering status in DeFi to more agile and scalable competitors. The race is on for Ethereum to deliver on its scaling promises, as the growth of its market cap alone is not a sufficient indicator of its long-term viability in an increasingly competitive landscape."

        "content": "The amount of Ethereum (ETH) owned by long-term holders has reached a new milestone, hitting 70% since Dec. 1.\n\nAccording to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, this is noteworthy as it puts Ethereum ahead of Bitcoin (BTC) per the same metric, which hovered just shy of 70%.\n\nThe amount of $ETH owned by long-term hodlers reached a record of over 70% in December pic.twitter.com/znKGxTAkvU \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 24, 2023\n\nSome market watchers consider the rise in the proportion of ETH held by these holders as showcasing a conviction in the cryptocurrency\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nThe record comes amidst predictions that the time for Ethereum to outshine Bitcoin is fast approaching. On Dec. 23, well-known crypto analyst Raoul Pal reiterated an earlier prediction suggesting 2024 could see ETH and BTC repeat their 2021 cycle.\n\nIn that year, ETH went on to outpace BTC\u2019s performance, growing by 254% to Bitcoin\u2019s 45% after initially falling behind.\n\nFor all the ETH bears\u2026 in Feb 2021, BTC first hit $44,000 (where it is today) and ETH was at $1400 (now $2250), 9 months later ETH was up 245%, BTC was up 45%\u2026\n\n\n\nI think ETH outperforming BTC will be a key macro trend of 2024 and our work at EXPAAM suggests it. 1/ pic.twitter.com/QGSZahhldg \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 21, 2023\n\nPal\u2019s outlook was mirrored in a cautiously optimistic forecast from JPMorgan analysts, who, despite their overall conservative attitude towards the crypto market, predicted ETH will outpace BTC and other digital assets in market price performance by 2024.\n\nYou might also like: Arthur Hayes forecasts Ethereum to soar above $5k in 2024\n\nThis upbeat outlook on ETH, as conveyed by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team, is tied to the significant EIP-4844 upgrade, known as protodanksharding. Set for launch in the first half of 2024, this upgrade is expected to significantly enhance Ethereum\u2019s network performance by implementing a more efficient sharding method.\n\nDespite the current price action still lagging behind Bitcoin\u2019s level, more analysts also feel the recent impressive performance of altcoins and L2 projects hints at an impending ETH rally, with the cryptocurrency currently priced at $2,300\u2014a 4.3% increase over the past seven days and an 88.6% increase over 12 months.\n\nYet, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently raised eyebrows by transferring 500 ETH, valued at over $1 million, to Coinbase, as per onchain analysts.\n\nThis follows a series of significant transfers made by Buterin in September and his statement in October that he hasn\u2019t \u201csold Ether for personal gain since 2018.\u201d\n\nThe recent activity in Buterin\u2019s Ethereum wallet, including a $3.79 million transfer in ETH over ten days in September, led to speculation of him selling his crypto holding, which he later clarified as being for philanthropy rather than personal gain.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "title": "When Can I Unstake Ethereum? Understanding Ethereum Unstaking \u2013 The Crypto Basic - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "\u201cWhen can I unstake Ethereum?\u201d, that is the question\u2026 gaining traction among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies continue to evolve incessantly, understanding the nuances of staking and unstaking Ethereum becomes essential, which is why this article by The Crypto Basic, your number one source for crypto news, aims to shed light on this topic, offering clarity for those navigating the intricate universe of crypto coins and staking.\n\nWhat is Staking Ethereum?\n\nStaking Ethereum refers to the process where Ethereum holders lock up their ETH to support the network\u2019s operation; this transitioned significantly with the Ethereum network\u2019s shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in September 2022, known as The Merge.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nStaking involves committing your Ethereum to the network, where it helps to secure the system and, in return, earns staking rewards.\n\nThis change aimed to enhance the network\u2019s energy efficiency and scalability.\n\nWhat Does it Mean to Unstake Ethereum?\n\nUnstaking Ethereum is the process of withdrawing your staked ETH along with any earned rewards; it\u2019s the reversal of staking, where you reclaim your staked Ethereum.\n\nUnstaking became possible with the completion of the Shapella upgrades (Shanghai and Capella upgrades), which followed The Merge; these upgrades allow users to retrieve their initially staked principal and unlock their staking rewards.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhen Should You Unstake Ethereum?\n\nThe decision to unstake Ethereum depends on several factors, including personal investment goals and market conditions; typically, you might consider unstaking:\n\n1. When You Need Liquidity\n\nIf you require access to your staked ETH for trading or other purposes.\n\n2. When Market Conditions Are Met\n\nBased on your analysis of the crypto market, you might choose to unstake to capitalize on favorable market trends.\n\n3. When You Require a Change in Your Investment Strategy\n\nShifting your investment focus away from staking to other forms of crypto investments.\n\nThe Process of Unstaking Ethereum\n\nUnstaking Ethereum is a process that requires careful consideration due to its irreversible nature; here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n1. Irreversible Requests\n\nOnce you submit an unstaking request, it cannot be canceled, i.e., your ETH in the unstaking process cannot be traded, transferred, or restaked.\n\n2. Rewards During Unstaking\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that ETH will continue earning new rewards during the unstaking period.\n\n3. Timeline\n\nUnstaking typically takes around 10 days, depending on network conditions and the number of users unstaking simultaneously.\n\n4. Reward Unlocking\n\nPost-Shapella upgrade, existing ETH staking rewards automatically go through an unlocking process, making them available without requiring an unstaking request.\n\nTechnical Aspects of Unstaking Ethereum\n\nUnderstanding the technicalities behind unstaking is crucial, and here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The Shapella Upgrades\n\nThe Shapella upgrades made unstaking feasible on the Ethereum network by introducing changes to both the Execution Layer (\u201cDeneb\u201d, where smart contracts and transactions occur) and the Consensus Layer (\u201cCancun\u201d, where network security and validator operations take place).\n\n2. Types of Unstaking\n\nEthereum supports both full and partial unstaking: full unstaking involves exiting the active validator set and receiving the initial stake plus accrued rewards; partial unstaking happens automatically when a validator\u2019s balance exceeds 32 ETH, where the excess amounts are sent to the validator\u2019s address.\n\n3. Exit Process\n\nExiting the validator set is a prerequisite for full unstaking; the time it takes to exit depends on the number of validators in the queue.\n\nThe process includes a cooldown period post-exit before the ETH can be unstaked.\n\nPlatform-Specific Unstaking Procedures\n\nDifferent platforms have distinct procedures for unstaking Ethereum; for instance, on Kraken:\n\nNavigate to the \u2018Earn\u2019 section after signing in; Select Ethereum (ETH) from the list of assets and choose \u2018Unstake\u2019; Enter the amount to be unstaked and confirm the process; The unstaked amount will appear as \u2018Pending\u2019 in the Portfolio tab until the end of the lockup period.\n\nRisks and Considerations in Unstaking Ethereum\n\nUnstaking Ethereum is not without risks and considerations, including:\n\n1. Market Volatility\n\nThe value of Ethereum can fluctuate significantly during the unstaking period.\n\n2. Loss of Staking Rewards\n\nOnce you unstake, you forfeit potential future staking rewards.\n\n3. Network Congestion\n\nHigh demand for unstaking can lead to delays in processing requests.\n\nKeeping Up with Ethereum and Crypto Trends\n\nStaying updated with the latest trends and news in cryptocurrencies is vital for anyone engaged in staking or other crypto-related activities.\n\nFor the most recent updates and insights in the world of cryptocurrencies, The Crypto Basic is your go-to source."
