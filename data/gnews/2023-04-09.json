        "summary": "  Polygon (MATIC) has surpassed Ethereum (ETH) in daily active addresses, with 399,950 users in the last 24 hours, compared to Ethereum's 376,350. This growth can be attributed to the performance of Polygon's decentralized applications (dApps) and the migration of the y00ts NFT to the Polygon network. However, Polygon's DEX volume saw a significant decline compared to other Layer 2 solutions, which had a knock-on effect on the network's total value locked (TVL) and the price of MATIC. Despite these challenges, the surge in activity on Polygon may have a positive impact on the price in the future."

Hard forks are permanent and split the network into two separate chains, while soft forks are backward-compatible and do not split the network.\n* Cardano's Vasil upgrade and Ethereum's Merge are examples of hard forks that improved the chain with new features.\n* Forks can help blockchain networks improve, but they also pose security risks if poorly executed.\n* DeFi application forks are copies of existing platforms with slight alterations.\n* Historic blockchain forks include Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, which aimed to provide more scalable alternatives to Bitcoin.\n* Ethereum has undergone several hard forks, including the Ethereum Classic fork, which split the network after a historic hack.\n* The Ethereum blockchain"
