He believes that Ethereum's staking model is problematic and resembles a regulated financial product, as assets are temporarily given to someone else in exchange for a return. Hoskinson's team developed a community-governed staking model for Cardano, which he believes is more effective. Shibetoshi, the founder of Dogecoin, also commented on the thread, wondering why the government wouldn't want to tax staking rewards. The news has caused concern in the industry, with many preparing for a potential ban. Hoskinson believes that the SEC's classification of all staking products under the same umbrella will be detrimental to the industry, as each has unique characteristics. The SEC has been given authority to regulate cryptocurrencies in the US and has initiated enforcement actions against several companies."

He argued that staking involves giving up assets to someone else for a return, which he believes can lead to centralization and poor protocol design. Hoskinson suggested that Cardano's approach to staking, which allows users to retain control over their assets, is more sustainable and promotes decentralization. The US SEC has increased its regulatory scrutiny over the crypto industry, with the chairman Gary Gensler expressing concerns that crypto exchanges offering staking services are similar to lending, even if the labels are changed. Hoskinson warned that all proof of stake protocols may be affected by a misunderstanding about the nature of staking."
