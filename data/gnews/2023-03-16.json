The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not provided a clear ruling, but the Howey Test can be applied to determine if Ethereum meets the criteria of an investment contract.\n\nKey points:\n\n1. Investment of money: Ethereum's validators deposit ETH as collateral to participate in the proof of stake (PoS) mechanism, which can be viewed as an investment of money.\n2. Common enterprise: There are two tests of commonality: horizontal commonality (pooling of funds and proportional distribution of profits) and vertical commonality (relationship with the investor and the promoter). Ethereum does not have a promoter, and the actions depend on the codes of the smart contract.\n3. Reasonable expectations of profits: There is a reasonable expectation of profits derived solely from the efforts of others, as the value of Ethereum can increase and holders can profit from the efforts"
