UXD (Ethereum, rollups) is supported by various approaches through Ethereum and rollups, while UXD (Solana) has limitations due to being on a different blockchain. The Solana team is working on three strategies to bring UXD to Ethereum, including delta-neutral positions on Optimism, Arbitrum, and yield aggregators on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism. UXD will become fungible across Ethereum, rollups, and connecting chains, with LayerZero as an interoperability solution. The UXD Protocol will focus on minimal volatility and higher yield, and will also create a new governance token offered on Ethereum for cross-chain functions. The governance token will be allocated to UXP (Solana) token holders, and insurance funding will be needed to balance potential losses. A proposal is to transfer $35 million USDC from Solana to Ethereum to support UXD on Ethereum and rollups."
