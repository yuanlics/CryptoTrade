        "title": "Is Ethereum Losing Steam in 2023? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto market has been having a tough year, to put it mildly. Prices are down across the board, the FTX implosion has left a bad taste in many investors' mouths, and more skeptics are voicing their concerns about the industry's future. While Ethereum (ETH 0.09%) has consistently given investors reason to be optimistic, it's also been hit hard -- falling nearly 70% from its peak in late 2021.\n\nGiven everything that's been happening in the crypto market lately, is Ethereum still a strong investment? Or is it losing steam in 2023? Here's what you need to know.\n\nReasons to be optimistic\n\nDespite the current market volatility, 2022 was a big year for Ethereum. The network successfully completed The Merge, transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) mining protocol to proof of stake (PoS), and dramatically decreasing its energy usage.\n\nThis was a major win for Ethereum and could also help it gain market share from the notoriously energy-intensive Bitcoin. It also sets the stage for future updates that will help improve Ethereum's speed and efficiency.\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason to be optimistic about Ethereum's future, though, is its potential in the decentralized application space. Ethereum is one of the most diversified investments in the crypto space because it's the leading blockchain within multiple niches. It's the most popular platform for NFT marketplaces, for example, and a key player in the metaverse. Its smart-contract abilities could also revolutionize a variety of industries.\n\nThe blockchain can also host other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is home to well-known projects like Shiba Inu, Polygon, Decentraland, and The Sandbox. If NFTs, the metaverse, smart contracts, or any of these Ethereum-hosted cryptocurrencies succeed, the network will benefit from it.\n\nDownsides to consider\n\nThe biggest reason to be skeptical of Ethereum right now is the fact that crypto, in general, is still speculative. Nobody knows for certain whether crypto will succeed over the long term or if it will even exist a decade or two from now. If the entire sector fails, it won't matter how strong the individual cryptocurrencies are.\n\nAlso, because the crypto industry moves so quickly, a new blockchain could disrupt Ethereum's competitive advantage. While Ethereum is a clear leader in the crypto space, its sluggish transaction times and high fees have been holding it back -- and users are getting frustrated.\n\nThe network does have updates in the pipeline to address these issues. But the major ones aren't expected to be completed until late 2023 or 2024, at the earliest. (And Ethereum has a history of delaying upgrades by months or even years.)\n\nThat's a long time in the crypto world, and a smaller competitor could swoop in and steal market share from Ethereum in the meantime.\n\nIs Ethereum still a good investment?\n\nWhen deciding whether to invest in Ethereum in 2023, it's important to weigh risk versus reward. The cryptocurrency has its drawbacks, and the future of crypto, in general, is still uncertain. There are no guarantees that any investment will survive over the long term, so consider your risk tolerance before you buy.\n\nThat said, Ethereum remains one of the strongest crypto assets in the game right now. It's not only the second-most-popular crypto behind Bitcoin, but it's also diversified into several different areas of the industry -- from NFTs to the metaverse, and more.\n\nIn short, Ethereum is a key player in the crypto industry. Despite its short-term volatility, it has a better chance of succeeding over the long run than many other cryptocurrencies. While nobody knows for certain what will happen, Ethereum still has plenty of growth potential."

        "content": "Tel-Aviv, Israel --News Direct-- SSV.Network\n\nssv.network DAO is launching a $50 Million Ecosystem Fund dedicated to supporting the development of Distributed Validator Technology (\u201cDVT\u201d) based applications. To usher in the next wave of Ethereum staking technologies, a host of Staking companies and VCs from the crypto space - including the likes of DCG, OKX, HashKey, NGC, Everstake, HackVC, GSR, Chorus.One, SevenX, 1kx, and more - have joined forces to help advance the next generation of staking solutions. All of these major players have come together to promote Ethereum\u2019s decentralization through the use of DVT.\n\nThe Fund is the first of its kind, dedicated solely to DVT use cases. Partners backing up the Fund are placing a special emphasis on helping projects that will support Ethereum\u2019s decentralization over the long run as more stakers join the network. DVT and the various use cases being built using the tech are similar to the early days of L2 implementations. However, each technology works on its own specific problem, DVT, focusing on Ethereum\u2019s security and decentralization, and L2s, which focuses on transaction speed and lowering costs.\n\nThe Fund's purpose is to Solidify DVT as critical Ethereum infrastructure\n\nDVT is a key component in Vitalik\u2019s Ethereum's roadmap toward a fully decentralized Ethereum 2.0. The ssv.network is the first implementation of DVT and has positioned itself as Ethereum's security layer - or Layer 0. With each Ethereum validator that uses DVT, the network becomes more decentralized and secure, bringing it one step closer to a global network uncensorable by any one entity.\n\nEarlier this year, the ssv.network DAO pledged $3 Million for developer grants. In less than 12 months, over $1.2 Million has been allocated to over 20 leading companies in the Proof of Stake (\u201cPOS\u201d) ecosystem. Among the grantees are industry-leading builders, including Blockscape, ANKR, Stader, Moonstake, and others using DVT to build their next-gen applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe time to build is now!\n\nTotal ETH at stake has officially reached 16 million, with the majority of it concentrated in the hands of a few players. It leaves the Ethereum ecosystem in demand for decentralizing factors such as DVT. Considering that the Shanghai update and the ssv.network\u2019s mainnet are approaching in 2023, there has never been a better time to build than the present.\n\nAlon Muroch, Core Dev Lead - \u201dDistributing Ethereum\u2019s security layer has never been more important. The protocol is currently secured by a small group of companies which, when put together, control the entire Blockchain. DVT\u2019s aim is to distribute Ethereum\u2019s security by offering quick and easy access to an open-source, public good that will completely change the way staking is operated today. There are already more than 20 companies building on top of ssv.network\u2019s DVT protocol, and that list is expected to grow significantly with the Eco Fund\u2019s launch\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that we are currently in a pivotal moment in ETH staking. We expect staked assets to increase as staking yields are considered the benchmark return for ETH owners. A near-term tailwind is Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade, which is due to be released in the first half of this year and will enable liquidity for those contributing to the network\u2019s core infrastructure. Few teams are as well-positioned as SSV to convene the diverse and cutting-edge products and applications that are using and developing staking technology. We are excited to support those projects as a founding member of this ecosystem initiative.\u201d According to Samantha Bohbot, VP Growth for DCG.\n\nAbout ssv.networks\n\nsv.network is a leader in the development of Distributed Validator Tech. DVT enables the distributed operation of Ethereum validators through a network of trustless nodes. As a core component of Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, DVT aims to solve protocol-wide correlation and downtime risks. The network is constructed as a community-owned public good run by hundreds of nodes across the globe. The Network supports over 50 development teams building next-gen ETH staking applications. The various use cases ranging from staking services to solo stakers built on the SSV protocol will usher in the widespread usage and adoption of the DVT primitive.\n\nContact Details\n\nMarketAcross\n\nItai Elizur\n\nItai@marketacross.com\n\nCompany Website\n\nhttps://ssv.network/\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/ssv-network-launches-50-million-ecosystem-fund-to-support-ethereum-pos-decentralization-562449608"
