The price is trading below $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, but there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,340 on the hourly chart. If ETH can clear the $2,390 resistance, it could start a steady increase towards $2,480. However, if it fails to clear the $2,390 resistance, it could start another decline with initial support at $2,320 and further losses could send the price towards $2,250 or even $2,200.
