        "content": "SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce: No Lawsuit Needed for Spot Ethereum ETF Approvals\n\nHester Peirce, a commissioner at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has stated that the SEC should not require a lawsuit to approve spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. Speaking to Coinage Media, Peirce emphasized that the SEC should learn from the Grayscale court ruling that preceded the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. She believes that the SEC should not need a court to tell it that its approach is \"arbitrary and capricious\" in order to make the right decisions.\n\nPeirce acknowledged that the facts and circumstances vary with each ETF application, but she expects the SEC to apply the same precedent that came from the Grayscale case. She stressed the importance of ensuring that the disclosures align with how the product actually works.\n\nSeveral companies, including BlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, and Hashdex, have submitted spot Ether ETF applications to the SEC for approval. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimates a 70% chance of a spot Ether ETF approval by May. The SEC has specific deadlines to decide on each application, ranging from May 23 to August 7.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously stated that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF does not signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for other cryptocurrency ETF applications. He emphasized that most crypto assets are investment contracts subject to federal securities laws."

        "content": "Ethereum price extended losses and tested the $2,300 support. ETH is now attempting a recovery wave above the $2,340 level and might test $2,390.\n\nEthereum started a fresh decline below the $2,420 and $2,400 levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,340 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair attempt a fresh increase if it clears the $2,390 and $2,400 levels.\n\nEthereum Price Revisits $2,300\n\nEthereum price struggled to start a fresh increase above the $2,550 and $2,580 resistance levels. ETH started a fresh decline and traded below the $2,400 support like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a move below the $2,350 level. A new weekly low was formed near $2,302 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,330 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,479 swing high to the $2,302 low.\n\nThere was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $2,340 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum is now trading below $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,365 level.\n\nThe next hurdle could be $2,390 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,479 swing high to the $2,302 low. The next major resistance is now near $2,400. A clear move above the $2,400 level might start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $2,480 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key hurdle sits near the $2,500 zone. A close above the $2,500 resistance could start another steady increase. In the stated case, Ether price could rise toward the $2,650 zone.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,390 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,320 level.\n\nThe next key support could be the $2,300 zone. A downside break below the $2,300 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, Ether could test the $2,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,200 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,300\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,390\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.
