        "title": "What Is Ethereum (ETH)? - The Motley Fool",
        "summary": "  Ethereum is a blockchain platform that enables the execution and verification of application code without a central authority. It was introduced in 2015 and has since become the leader in blockchain applications, with a wide range of uses including smart contracts, stablecoins, lending applications, decentralized exchanges, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The native token of Ethereum is ether (ETH), which is used to pay for certain activities on the network and has strong staying power in the crypto world. Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: While both are large cryptocurrencies, Ethereum builds on the underlying blockchain technology pioneered by Bitcoin, with a broader idea of decentralized applications. Ethereum uses a proof-of-stake model to secure the blockchain, while Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system. Transaction speeds are usually faster on the Ethereum network, but transaction costs can vary more widely based on network activity. Both have their use cases and could be viable investment choices for those interested in buying and holding crypto."

        "summary": "  Solana (SOL) has surpassed Ethereum (ETH) in daily active wallets, according to on-chain metrics. Solana's daily active wallets currently stand at around 400,000, slightly edging past Ethereum's. This increase in activity suggests that Solana is attracting a growing user base. Additionally, Solana also exceeds Ethereum in the number of daily transactions. The recent favorable price action in Q4 2023 may have contributed to Solana's recovery, with the coin rising by over 210% in the past three months. However, time will tell if SOL will extend its gains in the sessions. The immediate resistance line is at $70, and any upswing above November 2023 highs will be a building block for a possible leg-up that will lift SOL to April 2022 highs of $140. The recent release of Firedancer, a validator client developed by Jump Crypto, on testnet has supported SOL."

The whale deposited 39,260 ETH worth $87.5 million to the exchange Kraken, with the coins being acquired during a period of low prices in 2017. The transfer of funds to an exchange typically signals a desire to cash out some or all of the holdings, and the whale would make a profit of approximately $78 million if they decided to sell all their holdings on the exchange. Other large ETH holders are also being observed to take profits, with several recent transfers of funds to exchanges. The price of ETH has succumbed to sell pressure, with the crypto currently trading at $2,269, down by 1.5%. The market remains unpredictable, and it is uncertain whether ETH will approach and rebound at the $2,200 resistance level or continue to be driven lower by selling pressure."
