Instead, the smart contract accepts user deposits and stakes them in Lido ETH staking and MakerDAO's on-chain T-Bill protocol. Despite backing from VC firms and influencers, users must trust the team of anonymous developers to build the promised technology. Watts highlights security concerns, as the bridge contract is controlled by a multi-signature wallet held by newly created addresses.
