        "content": "An Ethereum-based (ETH) gaming altcoin is outshining crypto markets after being listed on tech giant Apple\u2019s app store.\n\nIn a new announcement, prominent gaming metaverse Axie Infinity (AXS) says it\u2019s expanding its global reach by joining forces with Apple to bring over its strategy-based card game to iPhone users in Latin America and East Asia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to announce that Axie Infinity: Origins is now available on iOS in select countries across [Latin America] and Asia!\n\nThis is [an] important step towards a world where anyone, anywhere can experience the magic of Axie on their preferred device. If you live in Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Indonesia, Malaysia, or Vietnam, you can now download Origins for iOS from the AppStore.\u201d\n\nThe game features digital pets called axies which players can collect in NFT (non-fungible token) form. According to Axie Infinity, this marks the first time ever that Apple has ever allowed outside NFTs to be usable in the Apple store.\n\n\u201cSignificantly, iOS Players will be able to use their NFT axies in this release. We believe this is the first time that Apple has agreed to make an externally-purchased NFT usable on the App Store.\u201d\n\nNews of the collaboration sent AXS flying. The 56th-ranked crypto asset by market cap went from its 24-hour low of $6.76 up to $8.11, a 20% increase. AXS has since retraced and is trading for $7.25 at time of writing, a 6.1% increase during the last day, while most of the crypto markets are trading in the red.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt\u2019s getting cheaper to lend and borrow your idle cryptocurrencies.\n\nCompound Finance has announced that it\u2019s deploying its latest iteration on the popular scaling solution Arbitrum.\n\nOne of the original decentralized finance (DeFi) products, Compound lets users lend and borrow various cryptocurrencies. The platform was also one of the first to experiment with so-called yield farming, distributing its native COMP token to the platform\u2019s users back in 2020. The token currently trades at $34.7 at press time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nArbitrum is the industry\u2019s largest layer-2 scaling solution by total value locked (TVL), per data from L2 Beat. TVL refers to how much money is sloshing around in a given project or chain.\n\nCompared to other popular Ethereum scalers, like Optimism or zkSync, Arbitrum takes the cake at a whopping $5.8 billion.\n\nCompound III is live on @arbitrum! You can now use ARB, GMX, WETH, and WBTC as collateral to borrow USDC on Arbitrum. To view the new market, select Arbitrum from the market selector in the Compound interface or click the link below: https://t.co/uzVunF4qBT pic.twitter.com/DuBUqzpHWl \u2014 Compound Labs (@compoundfinance) May 16, 2023\n\nCompound\u2019s deployment on Arbitrum is limited to just a few cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (ETH), Arbitrum, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and GMX (the token powering the eponymously-named decentralized exchange).\n\nThat\u2019s because the project\u2019s latest iteration, called V3, is optimized to manage risk by reducing the amount of long-tail crypto assets that can be lent and borrowed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum layer-2 wars heat up\n\nThis year has turned into something of a layer-2 season with the launch of various governance tokens, and the first instance of zero knowledge-powered rollup solutions entering the scene.\n\nCompared to \u201coptimistic\u201d rollup solutions, like those on offer from Arbitrum and Optimism, zk-rollups leverage a much more complex bit of cryptography. Members of this market niche include Starknet, Polygon\u2019s zkEVM, and zkSync. The collective TVL for just those three projects is $320 million.\n\nBoth solutions leverage rollups, which batch transactions off of the Ethereum mainnet (hence the term layer-2) and then convert those batched transactions into a small piece of data.\n\nThis smaller piece of data, called a proof, is what Ethereum ultimately validates. In this way, the mainnet remains relatively uncongested, keeping gas prices on the network low."

        "title": "High Gas Fees Worth the Pain? Ethereum's Deflationary Model in Action - Blockworks",
        "content": "Using Ethereum is expensive.\n\nWhether it\u2019s from trading on DeFi, flipping NFTs, or gambling with memecoins, transaction fees have been driven upward for months on the network. The rise extends to simply sending tokens from one wallet to another.\n\nWhile recent memecoin buffoonery has exacerbated the problem, ether (ETH) gas fees have been gradually climbing long before the more recent get-rich-quick PEPE craze, with previous perpetrators Uniswap and Blur elevating costs.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all bad. New mechanisms introduced by EIP-1559 in 2021 brought in the burning of base fees, causing deflationary conditions for the network.\n\nThis fee model contributes to the narrative of Ethereum as \u201cultrasound money,\u201d reducing the supply of ETH as on-chain activity drives demand. Adam Smith might have been on to something.\n\nIn theory, a reduction in supply should increase Ethereum\u2019s value as an asset in the long term. Avi Felman, head of digital asset trading at GoldenTree Asset Management, and Jonah Van Bourg, Cumberland\u2019s global head of trading, spoke to Blockworks on the 1000x podcast about their evolving investment thesis for Ethereum.\n\n\u201cEven though 16 gwei is neutral gas levels for Ethereum,\u201d Van Bourg says, \u201cwe\u2019re consistently averaging 50 to 150 gwei.\u201d As a result, ETH is highly deflationary at the moment, he says.\n\n\u201cAnd even if it does eventually die down,\u201d he says, \u201cthe ETH that\u2019s being burned as a result of this activity is never coming back.\u201d\n\nVan Bourg asks Felman, \u201cWhat does it mean for price, and what does it mean for supply and demand of block space? Is there an investment thesis there?\u201d\n\nEIP-1559 opened the monetary door\n\nFelman says the \u201cbest thing\u201d Ethereum ever did for itself was the implementation of EIP-1559, which made ETH as an asset more attractive for investment.\n\n\u201cIt opened the door for so much institutional capital to come into this space,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI gave a talk last week at a conference that was filled with a lot of pension fund allocators, a lot of institutional allocators. I got an obscene amount of questions on it,\u201d Felman says.\n\n\u201cMy job,\u201d he says, was to \u201cteach these guys about what crypto is, cuz these guys knew, when I say nothing, I mean literally nothing, about crypto.\u201d\n\nFelman suggests Ethereum fee burns behave like traditional finance stock buybacks. Just as a company can buy back their own equity to indirectly increase value for shareholders, a fee burn can indirectly drive price action for anyone holding ETH. \u201cIf ETH annualizes out to $5 billion a year in burn fees, that\u2019s a pretty substantial \u2018buyback,\u2019 right?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this is all during a bear market,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cThat really hit home for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nEthereum stands apart from other layer-1 protocols because of this formula, Felman says.\n\nOther layer-1s like Solana, he says, do not generate fees in the same way \u2014 and, importantly, do not burn fees to reduce supply. Alternative layer-1s as such do not \u201cgenerate revenue for their shareholders in the same way that Ethereum does,\u201d so \u201callocators are just way less likely to come in and buy it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause all eyes are on Ethereum, because that\u2019s where the speculative money is, because that\u2019s where the market participants are, they\u2019re able to charge those fees,\u201d he says.\n\nFelman compares the current attractiveness of Ethereum to the appeal of living in New York. \u201cYes, Manhattan\u2019s expensive, but it\u2019s expensive for a reason \u2014 because everybody\u2019s there, and everybody that you want to be around is already there.\u201d\n\nAnd the beauty of proof of stake is that all of those fees that are burned and all the fees that are generated, Felman says, \u201care now paid back to owners of the asset.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "The 3 Types of Cryptos That Could Outperform Bitcoin This Year - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Even with its recent pullback from the $30,000 price level, Bitcoin remains one of the top-performing cryptos of 2023. It is up 65% this year, and it's hard to find any large market-cap coins that can top this.\n\nBut savvy investors know it's best not to put all your eggs into one basket. If you are looking to diversify your crypto portfolio, here are three types of digital coins that could outperform Bitcoin this year.\n\n1. Potential Ethereum replacements\n\nWhile Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) continues to be the dominant Layer 1 blockchain in the crypto world, there are plenty of up-and-comers that hope to dethrone it. Three rivals that stand out are Solana, Aptos, and Fantom. Both Solana and Aptos are up more than 100% this year, and Fantom is not too far behind, at 93%.\n\nJudging from their performance, investors are not entirely convinced that Ethereum is going to retain its dominant role in so many key blockchain sectors, ranging from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi). While The Merge helped to improve the speed, efficiency, and scalability of the core Ethereum blockchain, these blockchain rivals are still much faster and cheaper. That has huge implications in areas such as DeFi, where users are looking for near-zero fees and near-instantaneous settlement of transactions.\n\nOf these Ethereum rivals, my personal pick is Solana, which has been out-innovating Ethereum of late. For example, Solana recently launched the first-ever mobile phone for a major blockchain network (the Saga) and has been exploring new initiatives to leverage all the hype and excitement around artificial intelligence, including a new plug-in for ChatGPT. For Solana to outperform Bitcoin, it will need to show that mobile crypto and crypto AI are sustainable, long-term growth catalysts.\n\n2. Scaling solutions for Ethereum\n\nIf you are looking for a less risky way to outperform Bitcoin, then blockchain scaling solutions for Ethereum could be the answer. Simply stated, these scaling solutions sit on top of the main blockchain and help Ethereum process transactions faster and cheaper.\n\nFor that reason, they are referred to as Layer 2 solutions (i.e., they are the second layer on top of the base Ethereum layer). Each scaling solution uses its own form of proprietary technology to accomplish its goals, so it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate among these different solutions.\n\nIf you buy into the idea that these Layer 2 coins are essential to the future success of Ethereum, then there are a few key prospects to target, including Immutable, Optimism, and Polygon. The name that's probably most familiar to investors will be Polygon, which has been making waves recently with new NFT initiatives, including a high-profile partnership with Nike to create an entirely new NFT marketplace for digital sneakers. However, if you are craving maximum upside potential, a better pick might be Immutable, which is up a mind-blowing 99% this year.\n\n3. Cryptos that help people stake on Ethereum\n\nLastly, there are a growing number of cryptos that help people stake on Ethereum. Now that Ethereum has transformed from a proof-of-work blockchain into proof of stake, this is tremendously important. Crypto staking is suddenly big business, and investors are always looking for ways to earn the highest staking rewards possible.\n\nThe two big names to watch here are Lido DAO, which is up 95% this year, and Rocket Pool, which is up 157% this year. Both emerged from relative obscurity after The Merge due to the popularity of staking, and both now currently rank in the Top 50 cryptos in terms of market capitalization.\n\nWhich of these is the best buy?\n\nThe common theme of all three categories of cryptos detailed above is that they somehow involve Ethereum. The first category, for example, includes all those capable of displacing Ethereum one day as the preeminent Layer 1 blockchain. The second category includes all digital currencies helping Ethereum scale bigger and faster. And the third category includes all cryptos that involve staking on Ethereum.\n\nSo if the prospect of picking winners and losers in niche areas of the blockchain space seems too daunting, the classic buy-and-hold crypto is Ethereum, which is up a not-too-shabby 52% this year.\n\nBut if you're looking for a little extra turbocharging for your portfolio, then my best picks would be Solana and Polygon. I'm long-term bullish on both of them, and I still regard both as best-in-class for their respective blockchain categories."
