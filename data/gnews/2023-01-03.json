        "content": "The Ethereum network eclipsed Bitcoin in terms of total transaction volume last year, though the king of crypto has managed to retain its crown when it comes to online search interest.\n\nAccording to data from Nasdaq and Ycharts shared on Reddit on Jan. 2, there were 338% more Ether (ETH) transactions in 2022 (408.5 million) Bitcoin (BTC) ones (93.1 million).\n\nETH vs BTC transaction volumes - Nasdaq/Ycharts via Reddit\n\nThe values shown in the chart are in millions of transactions, with the average daily transactions at around 1.1 million for ETH and 255,000 for BTC.\n\nHowever, transaction volumes on the Bitcoin network were steadier and more periodic than on Ethereum, which experienced much more volatility in transaction volumes. This was due to spikes in demand at certain times such as NFT launches and other gas-guzzling events such as XEN minting.\n\nEthereum\u2019s heftier transaction volumes have continued into the new year, with the Ethereum transaction count on Jan. 2 reaching 924,614, a 300% increase compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 229,191 on the same day, according to Bitinfocharts.\n\nETH vs BTC transaction volumes \u2014 Bitinfocharts\n\nThe analyst who posted the metrics said he was \u201cskeptical about people saying that a flippening could happen someday,\u201d adding that those advocating for it have reason to do so now.\n\nA flippening occurs when one chain surpasses a higher-ranked one for the same metric, in this case, transactions and activity.\n\nThe charts also do not include layer 2 transactions, which would put Ethereum even further ahead of Bitcoin for this metric. According to L2beat, the number of L2 transactions per second actually surpassed those on layer 1 Ethereum in mid-October and has remained above it ever since.\n\nRelated: Why the battle for low or no transaction fees really matters\n\nHowever, while Ethereum may be ahead in transaction and activity terms, Bitcoin remains the most-searched cryptocurrency online.\n\nOn Jan. 1, a newsletter from \u201cIn Bitcoin We Trust\u201d revealed that BTC attracted the most attention on the Google search engine in 2022, with 28.4 million monthly Google searches across the world.\n\nThe report concurred with Cointelegraph, which reported on Dec. 23 that Ethereum did not make second or even third place for search popularity. These spots were occupied by memecoins Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) respectively.\n\nEthereum, in fourth place, had 3.8 million global monthly searches, according to the data."

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst says layer-2 projects built on Ethereum (ETH) will likely dominate the crypto payments space in 2023.\n\nIn a new YouTube strategy session, pseudonymous Coin Bureau host Guy tells his 2.19 million subscribers that using crypto for payments will become more popular this year.\n\n\u201cMy fifth crypto prediction for 2023\u2026 that\u2019s that crypto payments will become more common. This will again be due to a combination of better frontends, regulatory clarity increasing liquidity and, most importantly, an increase in scalability that finally makes crypto payments feasible.\u201d\n\nGuy says layer-2s will play a critical role in the increasing adoption of crypto payments. Layer-2s are crypto projects designed to increase the number of transactions per second (TPS) that a smart contract platform can process.\n\n\u201cThis prediction comes from a series of headlines I saw over the summer about Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin saying how layer-2s on Ethereum will power crypto payments. This makes sense given that Ethereum is the most secure base layer to have for a payment system besides Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe says the rise of layer-2 dominance with crypto payments is more likely with an upcoming upgrade to the smart contract platform Ethereum. The planned Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 (EIP 4844) is meant to improve the blockchain\u2019s scalability using \u201cshard blob transactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoreover, developers will be implementing Ethereum improvement proposal, or EIP-4844 sometime next summer. For those unfamiliar, EIP 4844 will increase the scalability of Layer-2s on Ethereum by between 10x and 100x. Given that most Layer-2s already processed thousands of TPS, such an increase will put them on a par with Visa.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is changing hands at $1,212.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Could Ethereum Hit $2,500 in 2023? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ether (ETH -0.41%), the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, hit an all-time high of more than $4,800 in November 2021. That represented a whopping gain of more than 550% from the beginning of the year. At the time, many analysts believed it could go even higher. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone predicted Ether's price could reach $4,000 to $4,500 by the end of 2022. The crypto news outlet Coinpedia predicted its price could hit $6,500 to $7,500.\n\nHowever, Ether actually ended 2022 at about $1,200. Rising interest rates drove investors away from cryptocurrencies and other riskier investments, while the failures of several high-profile tokens and exchanges tarnished the industry's reputation. Many analysts have reined in their near-term forecasts for Ether, but the bulls still believe it could bounce back in 2023.\n\nFor example, CoinLedger CEO David Kemmerer recently predicted Ether could still rise to $2,500 in the first half of 2023 even as the crypto winter freezes other cryptocurrencies. Let's see if that target is realistic, and if investors who buy Ether right now can potentially double their gains within a year.\n\nWhy should investors pay attention to Ether?\n\nEther differs from Bitcoin (BTC -0.25%) in three major ways. First, miners can only mine for Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain. But on Ethereum, miners can mine Ether as well as other tokens. That open-source flexibility has facilitated the creation of many smaller altcoins. Ether can also still be effectively mined with high-end gaming GPUs, but Bitcoin now requires the usage of high-end ASIC miners.\n\nSecond, developers can create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized apps (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. That makes Ethereum a central pillar of the Web3 (also known as Web 3.0) movement -- which believes dApps will eventually disrupt centralized app ecosystems like Apple's App Store and Alphabet's Google Play -- and support the expansion of a decentralized metaverse of applications and services. As the largest token on the Ethereum blockchain, Ether is the default currency of that universe, and its price could stabilize as the token is used to purchase more goods and services.\n\nLastly, Ether is a more environmentally friendly alternative to Bitcoin. Ethereum previously used the same energy-intensive proof-of-work mining method as Bitcoin, but it transitioned to the more energy-efficient proof-of-stake method last September. That transition, known as The Merge, reduced Ethereum's energy consumption by about 99.95%. This could make it easier to scale up the Ethereum blockchain and support the development of more tokens, apps, and services. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's carbon output already rose 126 times between 2016 and 2021, according to Scientific Reports, as it became increasingly difficult to mine new coins. In 2020 alone, Bitcoin mining consumed more electricity than all of Austria.\n\nWhat's the bullish case for Ether?\n\nAt the end of 2021, the bulls believed The Merge would drive Ether's price to new highs. Instead, its price has actually dropped nearly 30%. The bulls believe that pullback is unjustified, and that Ether is merely being dragged down with the broader crypto market as interest rates continue to rise. They believe that Ether's current price doesn't reflect the benefits of The Merge or the long-term growth potential of the Web3 industry yet.\n\nThere's also the possibility that Ether and Bitcoin will remain the only two cryptocurrencies left standing when the crypto winter finally ends. If that happens, their prices could finally stabilize and become viable assets for institutional investors. Those tailwinds suggest that $2,500 might be a realistic year-end target.\n\nHowever, the crypto winter could also easily turn into an ice age. The failures of the Terra blockchain, the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, and other smaller altcoins are driving regulators to quickly tighten their grip on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nA global recession could also finish off the entire cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin and Ether, as investors completely lose their appetite for speculative investments. If that happens, Ether's price could easily stumble below $1,000 again. Unlike stocks, there's no clear way to fundamentally value Ether (beyond its last trade) to set a floor under its price.\n\nCan Ether double by the end of 2023?\n\nEther's price might stabilize this year as some investors cautiously return to the crypto market. But I also don't expect its price to more than double to $2,500. The macro headwinds should remain intense and cause investors to broadly shun the crypto, Web3, and metaverse markets while stashing their cash in government bonds and safe haven blue chip stocks. Ether's technological advances are impressive, but I don't expect investors to get excited about NFTs or dApps again until the macroeconomic situation improves and a new bull market begins."
