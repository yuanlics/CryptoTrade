However, its development pipeline suggests it may be worth considering other cryptocurrencies, such as Cardano and Solana. Cardano has climbed 874% since its launch in 2017 and has a unique development approach that emphasizes caution and thoughtfulness. Solana, launched in 2020, has skyrocketed 1,890% and is known for its fast transaction processing speed of 50,000 transactions per second, making it a prime candidate to disrupt the payments industry. Both Cardano and Solana have the potential to rise in value as they continue to improve their networks and increase utility in various industries."

        "summary": "  Ethereum's supply is growing again as gas prices plummet. The network's supply dynamics are complex, with transaction fees affecting the amount of ETH burned. The recent merge to proof of stake reduced ETH issuance by 90%, but gas prices have been declining due to various factors. The Ethereum Foundation's scaling efforts, the growth of Layer-2s, and a lack of narrative in the market are contributing to the decrease in gas prices. However, the future of Ethereum gas prices and supply is uncertain, with the adoption of ERC-4337 (account abstraction) and further layer-2 adoption potentially impacting the network. Lower fees may bring more users and activity to the chain, but increased congestion is a possibility."

This reduction reflects Ethereum's commitment to controlling inflation and managing its monetary policy with greater precision.\n\nEthereum's shift to PoS has introduced Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), a new breed of digital assets that represent underlying positions of staked Ether (ETH). LSTs offer flexibility, allowing holders to participate in DeFi activities, lend their assets, or trade them while maintaining their underlying staked ETH's staking rewards.\n\nThe rise of LSTs has seen approximately 10.8 million ETH, equivalent to 42.5%"
