Profile picture NFTs, including those from Azuki, often have unique qualities that can impact their value based on rarity, like eye color or clothing.\n\nOn Saturday, 12 Azuki NFTs that shared the specific background color \u201cOff White A\u201d sold simultaneously for 50 Ethereum worth $91,500 each. The previous Azuki NFT with an \u201cOff White A\u201d background had sold for less than 5 Ethereum or around $9,000\u2014making it a massive, eye-catching markup.\n\nThe 12 NFTs appear to have been gathered by Chang in a digital wallet. A large chunk of the trades\u2019 profits was then sent to a wallet labeled as \u201chanwe.eth\u201d using the Ethereum Name Service after they had been completed, according to Ethercan.\n\nKnowing there were bots out there copying his trait bids, Chang likely duped an unsuspecting trader into buying the Azuki NFTs at an elevated price by placing a bid on his own NFTs, an account that goes by A Raving Ape theorized on Twitter.\n\nContext on how @HanweChang executed a plan to perfection and made 800e by selling \"Off White A - Background color\" azuki at 50e each and azuki elementals at 15e each.

But it seems not everyone involved was entertained.\n\nThe bot\u2019s apparent owner, \u201celizab.eth,\u201d stepped forward on Twitter to claim the \u201cfunds were stolen form [their] bot.\u201d The trader wanted to discuss the possibility of bounty and said Chang could keep 10% of the funds if they agreed to return the rest.\n\nThe pseudonymous NFT influencer Dave III said Chang\u2019s statement wasn\u2019t very wise and warned others not to \u201cbrag about committing fraud,\u201d calling his trick \u201cillegal market activity.\u201d\n\nThese 2 crypto twitter posts will go down as the dumbest of all time. #1: Hanwe admits to \u2018Bid Spoofing\u2019 or \u2018Shill Bidding\u2019 \u2014 an illegal market activity of Fraud or Wire Fraud #2: Avi admits to Market Manipulation.

        "title": "What are Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)? - CoinGape",
        "content": "This article explains what are Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), their significance, and how they work in detail.\n\nEthereum is the most innovative blockchain that exists today. Backed by a strong team of developers, software engineers, and researchers, it constantly upgrades over time. But, have you ever wondered who is deciding and implementing these upgrades?\n\nA decision or a proposal to make a change to the network has to be agreed upon by the entire development community of Ethereum. Only then, they can put it into action. The Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) concept was introduced to make this process smooth. Let us help you understand everything about Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) in this article.\n\nWhat are Ethereum Improvement proposals (EIPs)?\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are standard potential changes, new features, or processes that improve the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.\n\nThey were first introduced in October 2015 following the footsteps of the Bitcoin Improvement Protocols (BIPs) process, which itself followed Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs). EIPs have all the information of an upgrade and act as a \u201csource of truth\u201d to the community.\n\nDecentralization is the core feature of Ethereum and hence anyone can suggest a change to the network. But, you must follow the guidelines included in EIP-1 to suggest a proposal. Till now, most of the EIP authors are application developers or protocol developers. And, EIP editors like Gavin Wood and Vitalik Buterin, review them, correct them, and format issues.\n\nSignificance of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)\n\nWhether it\u2019s the transition of Ethereum from a PoW network to a PoS network or the creation of non-fungible tokens, everything started with an EIP. They play a key role in every upgrade happening around the Ethereum network.\n\nSome of the top Ethereum Improvement Proposals that were already implemented are EIP-1559 (fee market change), EIP-20 (ERC-20 token standard), and EIP-721 (ERC-721 standard). The historical \u201cThe Merge\u201d event was proposed by the EIP-3675. Similar to these, every upgrade happening on the network consists of a set of EIPs.\n\nEIPs allow the network to change, improve, and adapt to the increase in its usage. This makes Ethereum flexible and constantly updates to changes in the industry and meets changing demands of the users. By going through the review process by the whole community, EIPs make sure that these decisions are inclusive and accurate.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)\n\nThere are 3 types of EIPs which we are going to discuss here.\n\nStandards Track EIP\n\nThe Standards Track EIPs change almost all of the Ethereum implementations. These proposals make changes directly to the Ethereum network protocol. They include changes in block or transaction validity rules, changes that affect the interoperability of Ethereum dApps, etc.\n\nStandards Track EIPs have 3 parts of implementation \u2013 a design document, an implementation, and an update to formal specification. Furthermore, we can categorize these EIPs into Core, Networking, Interface, and ERC proposals.\n\nMeta EIP\n\nUnlike Standards Track EIPs, Meta EIPs do not make direct changes to the Ethereum network protocol. These are more like procedures, guidelines, or changes in the decision-making process. We can also call them Process EIPs and these changes require community consensus as they are more than just recommendations.\n\nInformation EIP\n\nThese EIPs neither make changes to the network protocol nor require community consensus. These proposals suggest general guidelines or information to the Ethereum community. Members of the community and implementers can ignore informational EIPs or follow their advice based on their choice.\n\nHow are EIPs Processed?\n\nSimilar to how a law must pass some stages to be finally implemented, an EIP must also go through some stages. Every EIP must pass through the following steps.\n\nDraft \u2013 In this phase, the EIP is still in the hands of the author. Once it follows all the guidelines of proposing an EIP like having no errors, proper format, and making technical sense, it can now be submitted to the Ethereum repository on GitHub for review.\n\nIn this phase, the EIP is still in the hands of the author. Once it follows all the guidelines of proposing an EIP like having no errors, proper format, and making technical sense, it can now be submitted to the Ethereum repository on GitHub for review. Review \u2013 After being checked officially by an editor, the author can publish the EIP on GitHub. The next step is to mark the EIP as suitable for peer review. After passing through the early stages of review, the proposal needs a review by a wider public.\n\nAfter being checked officially by an editor, the author can publish the EIP on GitHub. The next step is to mark the EIP as suitable for peer review. After passing through the early stages of review, the proposal needs a review by a wider public. Last Call \u2013 Any EIP must at least be in the review stage for a minimum of 2 weeks so that the community has enough time to read, review, and suggest changes. In this stage, the proposals can be sent back and forth for changes by the author. If the EIP remains in this phase for more than 6 months, it will move to \u201cstagnant.\u201d\n\nAny EIP must at least be in the review stage for a minimum of 2 weeks so that the community has enough time to read, review, and suggest changes. In this stage, the proposals can be sent back and forth for changes by the author. If the EIP remains in this phase for more than 6 months, it will move to \u201cstagnant.\u201d Final stage \u2013 When the EIP clears all the stages of review, non-core EIPs reach the final standard. But, core EIPs need to go through another phase. The core development team will implement the approved proposal into the software to enable it.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum Improvement proposals (EIPs) are an important part of Ethereum\u2019s development over the years. The network is still under various upgrades to improve the overall scalability. All of these upgrades started with EIPs and are now making huge changes to the network. Overall, EIPs bring flexibility and adaptability to Ethereum which are essential to increase its adoption.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the most popular EIP?\n\nEIP-20, EIP-721, EIP-137, and EIP-1559 are popular EIPs. However, many EIPs exist today that are included in the upgrades of Ethereum.\n\nWhat is the purpose of EIPs?\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals make changes to the network to make Ethereum better. They make the network flexible, efficient, and adaptable to the changing needs of users.\n\nWhat is the difference between EIP and ERC?"
