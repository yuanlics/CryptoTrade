        "summary": "  The article discusses the valuation of governance tokens for Ethereum scaling solutions, such as Arbitrum's ARB and Optimism's OP. These tokens are used for governance purposes, such as voting on the direction of the project. However, some investors are questioning whether the valuation of these tokens is justified, given that they only provide governance capabilities and have no other use cases. The article also mentions that there are potential airdrops of these tokens coming from major scaling solutions, which could increase competition among Layer 2s and pressure rollup teams to substantiate the value of their tokens. Additionally, the article notes that Tezos co-founder Arthur Brietman believes that rollup tokens shouldn't exist at all, while former partner at 1confirmation Kofi has developed a dashboard showing the scaling solutions as increasingly profitable since July."
