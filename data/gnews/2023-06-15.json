        "summary": "  Ethereum is considering increasing the staking limit for validators from 32 to 2048 ETH. This change would allow validators to earn more interest and reduce infrastructure complexity, as they would no longer need to deploy millions of nodes to increase their yield. The team believes this change will also improve the user experience and make it easier to implement future upgrades to the Ethereum roadmap. During the recent ACDC call, the team discussed other potential tweaks to the network, including changes to validator attestation and aggregation deadlines."

        "summary": "  Ethereum price could potentially drop to $1,450 as the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision to pause interest rate hikes has led to a decline in investor sentiment. The daily chart shows bears are actively working to validate another drop below the lower ascending trendline, and the On Balance Volume (OBV) indicator shows sellers are resolutely holding the reins. Additionally, Ethereum's dominance in the DeFi sector has been contested by rising stars such as Optimism, Tron, Solana, and Polygon, leading to a loss of $7.84 billion in TVL since June 2022. The highest TVL in Ethereum's ecosystem is held by Lido, with MakerDAO coming in second and Aave, Curve Finance, and Uniswap filling the rest of the top five positions. The extensive crypto winter is the biggest challenge to investors in DeFi, and Ethereum price is likely to stay vulnerable until it reclaims resistance at $1,800."

This indicator has been high in recent days, suggesting large movements of dormant coins on the chain. This could indicate selling from long-term holders (LTHs), who are experienced investors holding coins for over 155 days. The price decline comes after the US Federal Reserve announced it would not raise interest rates this time but would hike them later in the year to fight inflation. The spike in the age consumed metric may suggest that institutions expected the move and shifted their coins early. As of writing, ETH is trading around $1,600, down 11% in the last week."

EigenLayer contracts enable stakers to shift their funds, and in the next stage, operators will be brought in to confirm activities related to Actively Validated Services (AVSs). The ecosystem will provide stakers with the option to allocate their staked ETH to operators, and stakers will have control over their selection of AVSs. The protocol will gradually lift restrictions, eventually reaching a fully backing liquid staking situation for Lido stETH, Rocket Pool ETH, and Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH. Deposits will be accepted for 3,200 tokens against each backed asset, and a seven-day withdrawal period will be introduced for safety reasons. External safety audits and bug bounties worth $2 million have been conducted to ensure safety. EigenLayer aims to decentralize the protocol and bring the community together for a complete trustless staking protocol."
