        "title": "Ethereum mulls increasing staking limit from 32 to 2048 ETH for validators - crypto.news",
        "content": "Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder has floated a proposal to increase the maximum effective balance of Ethereum validators from the current 32 to 2,048 ETH.\n\nThe change is expected to reduce staking infrastructure complexity for large validators and improve user experience if implemented.\n\nEthereum eyes staking limit increase\n\nThe minimum and maximum effective balances of Ethereum validators have been capped at 32 ETH since the network\u2019s successful transition to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism last year. However, a new proposal by Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder aims to increase that number significantly.\n\nThe current 32 ETH cap makes it impossible for validators to earn interest on staked ether beyond that number. The proposed change by Neuder aims to remove this limit and unlock various benefits for validators.\n\nWhile the current 32 ETH has made the Ethereum network more decentralized than ever, boasting 600,000 active validators and counting, the proposed change will enable validators to earn more interest while also reducing infrastructure complexity since they will no longer need to deploy millions of containing 32 ETH nodes, just to increase their yield.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum\u2019s zkSync Era reaches $500m in TVL\n\nAdditionally, the team has clarified that increasing the maximum effective balance to 2,048 will significantly reduce the load on the network\u2019s peer-to-peer layer brought about by the massive volume of messages.\n\nThe team claims the increase will also make the implementation of future Ethereum roadmap upgrades easier, amongst other benefits.\n\nDuring the just concluded Ethereum All Core Developers\u2019 Consensus (ACDC) call #111, the team also discussed other potential tweaks to the network, including changes to validator attestation and aggregation deadlines and more.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

Over the last day, the asset has fallen 7%, per CoinGecko.\n\nOther major losers this past week include Binance\u2019s BNB token (down 10.3%), XRP (down 9.1%), and Dogecoin (down 9.5%).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin (BTC) plummeted below $25,000 Wednesday morning trading 4% lower at $24,900. Over the week, the market\u2019s largest digital asset is down 6%.\n\nCoinGecko data shows that the total crypto cap lost 4.2% or roughly $40 billion in the last 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) dropped by 6.4% and touched three-month lows of around $1,630. On the weekly timeline, ETH is currently down more than 11.3%.\n\nThe wider crypto market is currently swimming in a sea of red amid the uncertainty around the pivot in the U.S. Federal Reserve's stance on hiking interest rates.\n\nThe markets initially had a soft reaction to the Fed\u2019s decision, trading sideways after the meeting; however, the downturn accelerated on Thursday morning.\n\nFed rates and crypto markets\n\nThe American central bank maintained the interest rate, leaving its benchmark interest unchanged in Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt also hinted that a few more interest rate hikes could come by the year's end.\n\nRate hikes increase the borrowing cost making credit expensive which cramps up room for wage and business growth. At the same time, higher interest rates in direct bank deposits and government bonds can make stocks and crypto less attractive to investors.\n\nToday\u2019s 0.17% uptick in the dollar index (DXY) against other reverse currencies after the FOMC meeting further affirms that the price action is driven by Fed\u2019s decision.\n\nThe U.S. stock market also reacted negatively to Fed's uncertain rate pause as the S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 indices dropped initially after the news.\n\nHowever, the equity indices recovered their intraday losses, with the S&P closing the day 0.08% higher and Nasdaq with 0.86% gains.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "title": "ETH Crashes 6% Daily, is $1500 The Next Target? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has experienced a decline in recent days after being unable to surpass the $2,000 level. However, it is currently testing an important support level, and its response to it is expected to have a significant impact on performance in the coming months.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nThe Daily Chart:\n\nOn the daily timeframe, Ethereum\u2019s price has faced rejection from the 50-day moving average at approximately $1,850 and has subsequently declined below $1,800. The price is currently experiencing downward momentum, but it is finding support near the 200-day moving average around $1,600.\n\nThe 200-day moving average is a strong indicator of the overall trend, and if ETH falls below it, it would indicate a continuation of the bearish market sentiment, potentially leading to a drop toward the $1,300 level.\n\nHowever, if the price bounces back from the mentioned moving average and successfully breaks above both the $1,800 level and the 50-day moving average, there is a high likelihood of Ethereum rallying towards the resistance level at $2,300 and potentially even higher.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart:\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, Ethereum\u2019s price has experienced a rapid decline in recent days after being rejected from the $1,900 level and the upper boundary of the large falling wedge pattern.\n\nIt is currently testing the lower trend line of the pattern, which is situated around the $1,600 support level. A breakdown below it would have severe consequences for the price.\n\nHowever, the RSI indicator is suggesting that the market is oversold, which suggests the possibility of a potential pullback, consolidation, or even a bullish reversal from the current area. Yet, the outcome will depend on whether the price is able to hold at the current level or if it breaks down further.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy: Edris\n\nEthereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has experienced a bearish trend after failing to surpass the $2,000 level. To gain insights into the reasons behind this behavior, analyzing the sentiment in the futures market can be informative.\n\nThe taker buy-sell ratio metric, depicted in the chart with a 100-day moving average applied, examines whether buyers or sellers are executing their perpetual futures orders more aggressively, meaning entering at the market price instead of setting limit orders.\n\nIt is apparent that when the price approached $2,000, the metric dropped below 1, indicating that short sellers started dominating the market and actively shorting Ethereum. This contributed to the downward pressure on the price. Although the ratio has shown a slight recovery recently, as long as it remains below 1, there is still potential for further downward price movement."

        "title": "Will Ethereum Price Crash to $1,450? ETH DeFi TVL Shrinks by $7.84B in One Year - CoinGape",
        "content": "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision to pause hikes on the benchmark interest rates has left many investors counting losses. Ethereum invalidated the positive market sentiment that had been building following reports of easing inflation in the US with losses amounting to 5.8% in 24 hours, to trade at $1,638 on Thursday.\n\nEthereum Price Downtrend Seems Unstoppable\n\nThe daily chart shows bears aggressively working to validate another drop below the lower ascending trendline. Ethereum price has been vulnerable to declines since early last week when the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a series of attacks on crypto entities and tokens \u2013 suing Binance and Coinbase.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIf ETH price sustains movement below the lower ascending trend line or support at $1,600, it would be an uphill task for bulls to arrest declines before they reach $1,450. Already the On Balance Volume (OBV) indicator, which measures the inflow and outflow of volume in the market, shows sellers resolutely holding the reins.\n\nAll the applied moving averages including the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the 100-day EMA, and the 50-day EMA hold above Ethereum price. A death cross pattern may come into the picture if losses extend into the weekend, with the 50-day EMA (red) crossing below the 100-day EMA (blue).\n\nTraders considering buying the dip must wait for a confirmed rebound from the short-term support at $1,630, reinforced by the lower ascending trendline. Another buyer congestion holds at $1,600 as the last line of defense to prevent all hell from breaking lose to $1,450.\n\nEthereum DeFi Total Value Locked Dips\n\nEthereum, the time-tested pioneer in the DeFi realm, has experienced a tumultuous journey with regard to its Total Value Locked (TVL). Though it has shown resilience in the face of shifting market tides, Ethereum\u2019s position has faced formidable challenges from rising stars in the space like Optimism (OP), Tron (TRX), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) among others.\n\nSince June 2022, Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the DeFi sector has been increasingly contested. Layer-2 solutions like Polygon have seen a considerable surge in TVL, thanks in large part to their ability to provide faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThis has inevitably impacted Ethereum\u2019s position, prompting a reevaluation of its supremacy in the DeFi landscape. According to the latest data on the DeFi space by DefiLlama, the network\u2019s TVL has since June 15 lost $7.84 billion.\n\nIf the rout continues, the TVL may drop further from the current $24.36 billion, thus fading in comparison to Ethereum\u2019s all-time high of approximately $108 billion in November 2021.\n\nLiquid staking platform Lido accounts for the highest TVL in Ether\u2019s ecosystem at $12.65 billion. MakerDAO comes in second place with less than half of Lido\u2019s at $5.47 billion, while Aave, Curve Finance, and Uniswap fill the rest of the top five positions in that order.\n\nThe extensive crypto winter is the biggest challenge to investors in DeFi. As the market wobbles they are forced to pull their staked holdings to diversify their portfolios. Unfortunately, this situation increases overhead pressure for DeFi protocols like Ethereum.\n\nEthereum price is bound to stay vulnerable until resistance at $1,800 is reclaimed for a continued upswing to $2,000 and beyond.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "title": "Ethereum staked ready to flip ETH on crypto exchanges - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum is fast approaching a very particular flippening.\n\nNo, ether (ETH) isn\u2019t about to eclipse bitcoin (BTC) in terms of market cap (at least, not yet).\n\nInstead, the raw number of ETH staked inside the Ethereum blockchain is set to surpass the ether kept on crypto exchanges for the first time ever some time over the next few weeks.\n\nEarlier this week, there was 22.8 million ETH ($39.75 billion) completely staked compared to almost 24.3 million ETH ($42.38 billion) sitting on exchanges, per Nansen data analyzed by Blockworks. Each represents about 20% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nThat worked out to be only 6.12% more ETH on exchanges than staked.\n\nAt the end of May, that spread was almost 16%.\n\nAt the start of the year, it was more than 41%.\n\nIt\u2019s not the actual flippening, but it\u2019ll do\n\nOverall, there\u2019s 4.9 million fewer ETH ($8 billion) on crypto exchanges than at the start of the year \u2014 a 17% reduction. And there\u2019s 5.7 million more ETH ($9.4 billion) locked in the Ethereum blockchain over the same period, a jump of one-third.\n\nThe figures suggest the SEC\u2019s persistent mudslinging has spurred Ethereum users to stake their ether rather than keep it on exchanges.\n\nEther stakers lock their tokens in the network to take part in consensus and earn yield, either by running validator nodes themselves or via services such as Lido.\n\nSome crypto exchanges also offer staking-as-a-service products, however the SEC generally considers those to be unregistered securities. Ethereum staking yield is currently about 6% (paid in ETH).\n\nMore ETH staked now than during FTX scandal\n\nGranted, crypto investors by far pulled the most ether throughout the FTX reckoning last November than at any point over the past 30 months.\n\nBack then, net outflows from crypto exchanges averaged nearly 130,500 ETH ($227.1 million) per day, from when FTX went kaput to the end of that month.\n\nNet outflows did surpass 200,000 ETH ($348.3 million) on June 5 \u2014 the same day the SEC sued Binance. A similar number was hit as Coinbase received its own lawsuit the following day. But they\u2019ve since tapered off.\n\nNet ether staked hovered between 69,600 ETH ($121 million) and 112,100 ETH ($195 million) in the days directly around those suits \u2014 roughly two-and-a-half times the daily average throughout the FTX collapse.\n\nIt is unknown whether the exact same ETH that was ripped from crypto exchanges ended up staked in Ethereum. In any case, net ether outflows from exchanges certainly spiked as the recent lawsuits hit newswires. But equal amounts haven\u2019t flowed into the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFor instance, interest in ETH staking peaked three days before the Binance case was revealed, with net staking inflows of around 397,700 ETH ($692.6 million) on June 2, the highest on record.\n\nNet outflows and net staked have picked up considerably amid the SEC crackdown\n\n\u2018Not your keys,\u2019 but make it yield\n\nStill, it appears general sentiment has shifted more toward decentralized blockchain architecture than centralized platforms susceptible to regulatory persecution.\n\nFor instance, net staking inflows were also really high throughout May after jumping considerably after the Shapella upgrade activated withdrawals in April.\n\nThe May surge also came after Kraken unwound its ether staking-as-a-service program due to SEC threats received in February, and after Coinbase\u2019s own Wells notice over similar services garnered in late March.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has said his firm wouldn\u2019t unwind its Ethereum staking products in the same way as Kraken.\n\nThe number of ETH staked flipping crypto exchange balances is a reassuring sign that crypto users truly value the benefits of decentralized technology. \u201cNot your keys\u201d and all that.\n\nIt took less than two weeks for the spread between ETH on exchanges and ETH staked to drop from more than 16% to 6%.\n\nIf that trend continues, the staking-exchange flippening should hit by the end of this month.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."
