        "content": "One measure of how ETH staking has been incorporated by institutions is the difference between ETH and BTC basis (i.e., the difference between futures and spot prices) in the CME, a venue used exclusively by institutional investors. The reason is simple: Given that ETH now derives a native yield and BTC does not, the difference between the BTC and the ETH basis should approximate this yield because it reduces the futures contract carry cost."

        "content": "A closely followed crypto strategist thinks that the leading smart contract protocol Ethereum (ETH) is positioning for a year-end surge.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 199,000 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum will likely see significantly higher prices before 2023 expires.\n\nIn the coming weeks, however, the analyst says that ETH could correct to as low as $1,300 before starting its ascent.\n\n\u201cExpecting something like this on ETH. My strategy is the same, no matter if $1,500 or $1,300, I keep accumulating. Simple plan, simple life.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he appears to predict that Ethereum could climb to as high as $2,000 by the end of the year. The chart also shows Ethereum surging above $2,500 in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is worth $1,590.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin (BTC), Inmortal predicts that the crypto king will revisit support at $25,800 before rallying back to its resistance at $27,300.\n\n\u201c$25,800 is the only level I would long.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, BTC is trading for $26,286.\n\nThe trader is also keeping a close watch on Radix (XRD), a decentralized finance (DeFi) programming environment. According to Inmortal, RDX looks poised for another leg up toward the $0.086 level as the project gears up for the mainnet launch of its Babylon upgrade.\n\nAccording to the project\u2019s website, the Babylon update will enable \u201cpowerful\u201d smart contract functionalities for Radix and \u201ckickstart a live DeFi ecosystem.\u201d\n\nSays Inmortal,\n\n\u201cTextbook retest, +30% since then. Mainnet launch in 3 days. Babylon.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, RDX is worth $0.061.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
