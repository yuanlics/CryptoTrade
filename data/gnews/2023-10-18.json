Zk-rollups work by batching hundreds of transactions off-chain and generating cryptographic proofs that certify their validity, which are then submitted to the blockchain for verification. This allows the blockchain's capacity to increase exponentially while ensuring users still benefit from the blockchain's security. Notable zk-rollup projects include Polygon, dYdX, and ZK-Sync, and zkEVMs are being developed to bring compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Zk-rollups offer advantages such as scalability, security, and low costs, but also have higher computational costs and complex engineering frameworks."
