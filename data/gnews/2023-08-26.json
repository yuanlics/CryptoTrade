        "title": "If You Invested $100 in Ethereum, Here's How Much You'd Have Now - The Motley Fool",
        "summary": "  If you invested $100 in Ethereum (ETH) four years ago, you would have $771 today, with a return of 671%. If you invested in Ethereum three years ago, you would have $433 today, with a return of 333%. However, if you invested in Ethereum in late 2021, just before prices plummeted, your investment would be worth around $70 today, with a return of -30%. It's important to note that past performance doesn't predict future returns, and Ethereum is still a speculative investment. Despite its advantages, such as its size and developer commitment to upgrades, the crypto market can be volatile, and Ethereum's future success depends on factors such as adoption of its uses (e.g., NFTs, DeFi, metaverse) and the success of its upcoming upgrades."

        "title": "This Ethereum Metric Has Sparked Centralization Concerns Over ETH Ownership - NewsBTC",
        "summary": "  The top 10 Ethereum addresses now control over 35% of the total ETH supply, up from 11.2% in 2018. This growth in concentration of ownership has sparked concerns about centralization in the Ethereum network. The largest address is the Beacon Deposit Contract, which holds over 24% of the total supply. Cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Kraken also hold significant amounts of ETH, making them the largest single entities. In comparison, the top 10 addresses on Bitcoin control only 5.35% of the total supply. Large ETH holders, including whales, can have a significant impact on the price of ETH, and an increase in deposits into the ETH 2.0 staking contract is seen as a positive sign. However, the number of wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH has risen, and there has been an increase in whale transactions. Despite this, ETH's price is currently trading at around $1,600, down 11% in the past month."

Cardano is currently ranked eighth in market capitalization, with a valuation of $9.05 billion, compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum's market caps of $506.21 billion and $198.07 billion, respectively. Hoskinson believes that Bitcoin's static design and Ethereum's dismissal of on-chain governance could become long-term liabilities for these projects, while Cardano's commitment to decentralized decision-making could help it overtake them in the future. Additionally, Hoskinson predicts that Cardano could become more than just a cryptocurrency and become the backbone of a new digital nation.
