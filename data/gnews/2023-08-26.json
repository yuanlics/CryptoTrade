        "content": "Share:\n\nCharles Hoskinson commented on recent developments in Cardano and that the project is on its way to beat competitors Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nHoskinson believes Cardano is likely to become the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency with its governance model and decentralization.\n\nADA price is currently in a downward trend that started in mid-April and the altcoin is at support at $0.2589.\n\nCharles Hoskinson, an American entrepreneur and the creator of Cardano shared his thoughts on Cardano. The creator of the Ethereum-alternative believes the token is likely to beat competitors Bitcoin and Ethereum, in terms of market capitalization, through its mass adoption.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s statements have failed to catalyze a recovery in the altcoin, and ADA price is at support at $0.2589, at the time of writing.\n\nAlso read: XRP price makes comeback above $0.50 as pro-XRP lawyer urges former SEC officials\u2019 testimony\n\nCharles Hoskinson believes Cardano can beat competitors\n\nCardano\u2019s competitors Bitcoin and Ethereum have the largest market capitalization in the crypto ecosystem. Hoskinson gave a talk at blockchain convention Rare Evo 2023, and shared his views of the recent developments in Cardano.\n\nDuring his speech, Hoskinson explained that Cardano is probably going to become the biggest cryptocurrency in the world. To back his bullish comments on the project, Hoskinson attributed the project\u2019s sustainability, scalability and interoperability set it apart from the approach taken by blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nA recent update in Cardano, the Alonzo upgrade, powers smart contracts on the altcoin\u2019s blockchain and supports dApps and DeFi projects and their development in the ADA ecosystem. Cardano\u2019s utility and potential market reach are therefore drivers that can beat Bitcoin, Ethereum and other projects in the ecosystem.\n\nAt the time of writing, ADA price is in a downward trend and exchanging hands at $0.2589. The altcoin is below its three long-term Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 10,50 and 200-day at $0.2665, $0.2890 and $0.3344.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s commentary did not act as a bullish catalyst for ADA price and it remains to be seen whether the altcoin will begin its recovery from the downward trend."

        "content": "IOG CEO Charles Hoskinson makes bold predictions for Cardano.\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the CEO at Input Output Global (IOG), has made audacious predictions for leading blockchain Cardano.\n\nDuring his speech at the Rare Evo 2023 convention, Hoskinson predicted that Cardano would overtake Bitcoin and Ethereum to become the biggest cryptocurrency in the world.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to Hoskinson, Cardano will achieve this tremendous feat in the future due to its commitment to decentralized decision-making and on-chain governance.\n\n\u201cSo, that is our challenge, and this is why I think that Cardano is probably going to become the biggest cryptocurrency in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nCardano Ranks Behind Bitcoin & Ethereum\n\nIt is worth noting that Cardano is far behind Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of market capitalization. At the time of writing this line, Cardano is ranked as the eighth-biggest cryptocurrency, with a market valuation of $9.05 billion.\n\nConversely, Bitcoin and Ethereum sit as the first and second largest cryptocurrencies, with market caps worth $506.21 billion and $198.07 billion, respectively.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHoskinson Highlights Bitcoin & Ethereum Downsides\n\nAlthough Cardano is far behind Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of valuation, Hoskinson still thinks ADA will eventually become the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency.\n\nPer Hoskinson, the inefficient governance models of the market leaders- Bitcoin and Ethereum- could help Cardano overtake them in the long term.\n\nHoskinson pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s weakness could come from its static design. Notably, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has not changed its design for 13 years.\n\nAdditionally, he said Ethereum\u2019s dismissal of on-chain governance could also become a long-term liability for the crypto project, especially as it accumulates millions of users.\n\nHoskinson Makes Other Predictions\n\nFurthermore, Hoskinson also made other predictions, including the fact that Cardano might eventually become more than just a cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s [Cardano is] going to become the backbone of a new digital nation, a new society\u2014a place where we can finally begin to trust each other again, where we move from \u2018don\u2019t be evil\u2019 to \u2018can\u2019t be evil,'\u201d he added.\n\nADA Down 1.6% In 24 Hours\n\nMeanwhile, Cardano\u2019s native token ADA is trading at $0.25, down 1.6% over the past 24 hours. The crypto asset has been recording consistent declines since May 2023.\n\nAs reported earlier, ADA could register further dips, as a recent chart shows the coin is replicating its 2019 price movements."

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThis week markets appeared grateful for the dearth of news\u2014\"no news is good news,\" as the saying goes. Most leading cryptocurrencies recovered their losses over the week after last Thursday's flash crash sank virtually all leading cryptocurrencies by double-digit percentages.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) currently holds the fort at $26,015, about 0.4% cheaper than it was this time last week. A lot of Bitcoin mining machinery came online this week, as evinced by the fact that the network on Wednesday hit a new all-time high for mining difficulty alongside a corresponding spike in hash rate, or computational power.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, matched Bitcoin\u2019s pace. At its current price of $1,647, it is down 1.6% from last week.\n\nBroadly speaking, most top thirty cryptocurrencies retained their value. The only notable depreciation over the last seven days fell upon holders of Uniswap (UNI) and Avalanche (AVAX). AVAX fell 7.2% to $10.02, while UNI crashed 7.9% to $4.58.\n\nMeme coin PEPE is still in freefall. On Monday it posted intraweek losses of over 20% as it slid from 71st to 84th place. It now enters the weekend at $0.000000865154\u2014the 98th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap\u2014or about 23.3% lower than it was a week ago.\n\nAdding to its generally poor performance, the PepeCoin team\u2019s multi-sig Ethereum address transferred 16.045 trillion PEPE\u2014worth $16.85 million at the time\u2014to four exchanges: Binance, OKX, KuCoin, and Bybit, on Thursday.\n\nThe lack of communication from the team about these transfers contributed to some heated panic selling.\n\nCapital cities were silent about crypto this week. There were only a few stories of any note.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the news...\n\nThe Kenyan government on Monday established a committee to inquire into OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s crypto project Worldcoin\u2014a controversial project which offers people around the world free crypto if they visit their nearest \u201cOrb\u201d and supply it with biometric data (a snapshot of their eyeballs). Kenya\u2019s move came three weeks after the country suspended Worldcoin\u2019s activities within its borders.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm and charged him with crimes related to money laundering. Co-founder Roman Semenov, who was also named in the indictment, remains at large in Dubai.\n\nLast year, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) banned Americans from using privacy mixer Tornado Cash, claiming that criminals had used it to launder money\u2014specifically naming the North Korean state-sponsored hacker organization Lazarus Group.\n\nEarlier this week, the legislative body of the Central African Republic (CAR) granted approval for the tokenization of land and natural resources to help the government position the country as an up-and-coming business destination in Africa.\n\nThe project launched last year with resource tokenization in mind; it is meant to facilitate investment in CAR through Sango Coin, a state-issued token\u2014though not a Central Bank Digital Currency\u2014backed by Bitcoin on a sidechain network. However, initial responses to Sango Coin\u2019s launch were lukewarm."

        "content": "Crypto blockchains are designed to be fully decentralized so that no single person or group has control. However, new data has shown that the top 10 Ethereum addresses control over 35% of the total ETH supply. For a network that was designed to be decentralized, this has sparked some serious concerns over how centralized ETH has become.\n\nThe 10 Largest Ethereum Addresses Hold Over 35% Of The Available Supply\n\nWhile sharing the metric on social media platform X, crypto market intelligence platform Santiment showed how holdings of the 10 largest Ethereum addresses have now climbed to 35% of the total supply.\n\nThis indicates that while small traders have been trying to offload their supply during the recent price crash, many ETH whales are taking the chance to buy the dip.\n\n\ud83d\udc33 The 10 largest addresses on the #Ethereum network are now holding over 35% of the available supply. By no means does this mean the #2 asset in #crypto is suddenly #centralized, but it shows the capitulation of smaller traders showing #FUD from this dip. https://t.co/G3wIeBzelb pic.twitter.com/TXkKjSwwmn \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 25, 2023\n\nOver the past 5 years, the top 10 largest Ethereum addresses have seen their share of the total ETH supply grow substantially. Data shows that these addresses held only 11.2% of the total supply in August 2018, and then rose to 24% in August 2022. The current level means these 10 largest holders have accumulated 11% more in the past year.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Ethereum has been seeing its top 10 addresses expand and accumulate more and more of the total available coin supply. In 5 years, the top 10 largest addresses have gone from owning 11.2% to now 34.6% of $ETH. The 27.86M $ETH added is worth $51.6B. \ud83d\ude2e https://t.co/utI8W6DkRX pic.twitter.com/klgb7pus7K \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 9, 2023\n\nEtherscan, an Ethereum block explorer, shows the top account balances in ETH, with the largest address alone (Beacon Deposit Contract) controlling over 24% of all supply. Next comes in Wrapped Ether at 2.7%.\n\nHowever, most of the largest ETH holders are cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Kraken. One of Binance\u2019s wallets (Binance 7) holds over 1.66%, while the exchange also holds large ETH amounts in other wallets, making it the largest of any single entity.\n\nIn comparison, the top 10 addresses of Bitcoin, the largest crypto in the world, own only 5.35% of the total supply. This, of course, does not take into account Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin cache.\n\nETH price struggles amid centralization concerns | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nETH Centralization Concerns?\n\nWhales are known to have considerable control over the price movement of cryptocurrencies in the crypto market and large selloffs by these holders can lead to an increase in selling pressure from smaller investors, causing a dump in the price of ETH.\n\nHowever, considering the largest holder is the Ethereum is the Beacon Deposit Contract used for staking ETH, an increase in the contract spells positive news. More deposits into the contract signal that more investors are depositing to become validators in ETH 2.0.\n\nInterestingly, the number of wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH has risen to 355,000, and 1,788 more 10-10,000 ETH wallets have been added since the beginning of June. Whale transactions in the past week alone have also crossed 23,073 ETH, the highest since May.\n\nAs for ETH\u2019s price, the token is currently trading at around $1,600, down 11% in the past month.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "If You Invested $100 in Ethereum, Here's How Much You'd Have Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's no secret that crypto has been struggling over the last couple of years. And after a whirlwind surge in 2023, prices are falling yet again.\n\nHowever, many cryptocurrencies have still proven to be incredibly lucrative long-term investments. For example, while the price of Ethereum (ETH 0.42%) has fallen by around 11% over the last month, it's still up more than 300% over the last three years -- and that's despite the brutal crypto winter throughout 2022.\n\nIf crypto prices rebound, we could see similar gains over time. And while past performance doesn't predict future returns, it can sometimes be encouraging to look at how much you could have earned if you'd invested years ago.\n\nHow far could Ethereum have taken you?\n\nEthereum is one of the biggest success stories to come out of the crypto market. Despite extreme volatility, it remains the second most popular name in the industry. It currently has a market cap of around $198 billion, making up around 20% of the entire crypto sector.\n\nWhile it certainly hasn't been immune to volatility, it's also fared better than many of its competitors. Its price is currently down by around 65% from its peak in late 2021, while Cardano has fallen by a staggering 87% in that time, and Solana has plummeted by around 91%.\n\nFor long-term investors who stuck it out through the rough patches, Ethereum has been a lucrative investment. Here's how much $100 of Ethereum would be worth today, depending on when you'd invested:\n\nDate Invested Ethereum Returns as of Today How Much $100 Would Be Worth Today Aug. 1, 2021 -30% $70 Aug. 1, 2020 333% $433 Aug. 1, 2019 671% $771\n\nThe short term can be rocky for crypto, and if you'd invested in late 2021 right before prices plummeted, your investment would have declined in value. But if you'd invested just four years ago and held through all the ups and downs, you'd have nearly 8 times your initial investment by today.\n\nIs Ethereum a good investment right now?\n\nAgain, past performance doesn't predict future returns. There are never any guarantees when investing, and this is especially true with crypto due to its speculative nature. No one can say, then, whether Ethereum will continue on its track of explosive long-term returns.\n\nThat said, Ethereum is one of the strongest players in the crypto space, and it has a slew of advantages. Its sheer size is one of them, as it's far and away the most popular network for decentralized applications -- such as NFT marketplaces, DeFi projects, and metaverse apps.\n\nEthereum's developers are also committed to consistently upgrading the blockchain to make it stronger and more useful. Last year, they successfully pulled off The Merge -- a landmark upgrade that moved Ethereum from the energy-intensive proof-of-work system to the far more efficient proof-of-stake model.\n\nThe Surge is one of the next eagerly awaited updates, and it aims to improve the network's speed and reduce transaction fees. These have long been two major pain points for Ethereum, and if developers are able to successfully pull off this update, it could be a game-changer.\n\nDownsides to consider before you buy\n\nWhile Ethereum has plenty of advantages, it won't be right for every portfolio.\n\nLike the crypto industry in general, Ethereum is still a speculative investment. Although it does have a fair amount of utility (especially compared to many of its competitors), its primary uses are also somewhat speculative right now. If NFTs, DeFi, or the metaverse become more mainstream, for instance, Ethereum could thrive. But if they never catch on, it could spell trouble.\n\nMuch of Ethereum's future success also hinges on its upcoming upgrades. If those updates take longer than expected to complete or there are significant hiccups during the rollouts, that could shake users' confidence -- and provide an opportunity for competitors to swoop in and grab market share.\n\nIn short, Ethereum is still speculative, but it's also one of the strongest investments in the crypto space right now. If you're willing to take on more risk for the chance to earn potentially lucrative returns over the long run, it may be a smart addition to your portfolio."
