        "content": "Etherscan also allows for the tagging of certain wallets \u2013 which is very useful when you need to follow the money. For example, it\u2019s possible to track the wallet that drained balances from FTX accounts shortly after the exchange went bankrupt. You usually can\u2019t see transfers from exchanges, which largely do not process trades on blockchains but instead on internal matching engines. It\u2019s cheaper for exchanges to avoid the blockchain because they do not have to pay gas fees. That said, you can see some interesting information about exchanges, such as how much ETH crypto exchange Kraken holds in one of its wallets."

        "content": "In a surprising move, an Ethereum \"whale\" has come back to life after being dormant for over two years. The large investor, identified as an early participant in Ethereum's initial coin offering (ICO), staked 4,032 ETH, equivalent to approximately $7.4 million, according to data from Lookonchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis sizeable stake, made just hours ago, marks the whale's first activity in 2.4 years, stirring considerable excitement and speculation within the crypto community.\n\nThe whale, whose address was shared on Lookonchain's Twitter page, was a part of Ethereum's genesis \u2013 the network's inception phase when the Ethereum ICO took place.\n\nDuring the ICO, this investor received a staggering 60,000 ETH. Ethereum's genesis event was a public crowdsale that occurred in July and August 2014, where investors purchased ETH in exchange for Bitcoin.\n\nThe whale's Ethereum balance at the time of the tweet was 6.751 ETH, valued at approximately $12,288.33, based on Ethereum's current value. The whale's most recent transaction was recorded about six hours prior, and it's the same transaction in which the 4,032 ETH stake was made.\n\nWhether this activity is indicative of a larger trend among Ethereum ICO participants, or an isolated event, only time will tell."

Discover SCENE\n\nNFT marketplace Blur is growing by leaps and bounds.\n\nWith the launch of Blend, Blur\u2019s new lending platform, it\u2019s hit yet another milestone.\n\nData per Dune, now shows that Blend has facilitated more than 100,000 ETH in total volume, or roughly $181 million, just 17 days since its launch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlend lets users take out Ethereum loans by putting their NFTs up as collateral. They can then use this loan to purchase new NFTs on the Blur marketplace. In return, liquidity providers receive interest, a mechanism that\u2019s spawned the \u201cNFTfi\u201d niche in crypto.\n\nTotal volume on Blend in ETH. Source: Dune .\n\nThough the project racked up more than 3,000 loans from 900 unique lenders, adding Bored Apes Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Clube (MAYC) collections on Monday fueled further enthusiasm among NFT collectors.\n\nThese collections were added to the four collections previously available, Azuki, Wrapped Cryptopunks, DeGods, and Miladys.\n\nBAYC and MAYC accounted for a total volume of 2,267 ETH on day one. On Wednesday, BAYC was the third-most traded collection on the platform with a volume of 3,082 ETH, just behind Azuki (4,616 ETH) and Wrapped Cryptopunks (2,260 ETH).\n\nAzuki remains the top collection in total volume, having exceeded 50,000 ETH, which is nearly half of the total volume since the service was created.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCurrently, Blend does not take any fees from either borrowers or lenders. However, Blur has indicated that token holders could vote to implement fees after a 180-day period.\n\nBlur\u2019s bumpy start\n\nLaunched just last fall, Blur quickly became the most popular NFT marketplace, representing nearly 59% of the total NFT transaction volume to date.\n\nHowever, some suspect the platform of harboring wash trading operations, especially amid the platform\u2019s token launch.\n\nAccording to analyst Hildhobby, Blur indeed only accounted for 14,575 traders, compared to 46,353 on Opensea.\n\nAt the end of February, CryptoSlam, a platform for tracking NFT sales, announced that it would remove $577 million worth of Blur trades from its data due to \"market manipulation.\" The platform also said that it will filter future Blur trades on its platform through an updated algorithm that excludes what it sees as suspicious sales.\n\nNevertheless, the success of Blend only strengthens Blur's position, which seems set to establish itself in the long run as a major player in the NFT ecosystem."

Data from The Block revealed a 113% increment in the count of daily active addresses on the chain.\n\nAssessed on a month-over-month (MoM) basis, Solana recorded a total of 7.72 million active addresses in April. Interestingly, with about two weeks left to go in May, the chain has already seen 7 million active addresses.\n\nAdditionally, data from The Block showed that new address count on the chain has grown significantly since the end of April.\n\nNew users flock in\n\nIn May, Solana witnessed the creation of 4.19 million new addresses, surpassing the count of 3.76 million new addresses that joined the network in April.\n\nThis surge in new address creation on the L1 network highlights the growing adoption of the platform amid high transaction fees on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks.\n\nHowever, while Solana\u2019s network activity has experienced growth since the end of April, data from Artemis revealed a decline in other ecosystem metrics.\n\nFor example, according to the on-chain data, the network\u2019s total value locked (TVL) was on a downtrend since 19 April. At $269.78 million at press time, it has since fallen by 8%.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nLikewise, the decentralized exchanges (DEXes) housed within the L1 network suffered a drop in transaction volume since the month started. Per data from Artemis, DEX volume on Solana has plummeted by 66% since the beginning of May.\n\nRegarding the chain\u2019s native coin SOL, trading at $20.73 at press time, its value declined by double digits (17%) in the last month."

On March 1, 2023, ERC-4337 was rolled out to the Ethereum mainnet, adding the ability for smart contracts to transact on behalf of the user.\n\nIn this experiment, Visa put together two prototypes that demonstrate potential use cases of a new Paymaster flow: first, using the Paymaster to facilitate the use of ERC20 tokens to pay for gas fees, and second, completely covering the gas fees for a transaction.\n\nIn the second experiment, a paymaster contract was setup that completely covers the gas fees for user txns. In their sample implementation, the user must be whitelisted to be sponsored (L30).\n\n\n\nContract link: https://t.co/NdH0xE2oLt. pic.twitter.com/rGaASN7P5s \u2014 cygaar (@0xCygaar) May 17, 2023\n\nIn line with this, the Visa team deployed experimental Visa Paymaster contracts on Ethereum's Goerli Testnet.\n\nIt demonstrated paying with ERC-20 tokens using ERC-4337 Paymaster via the first Visa Paymaster contract, wherein it explored whether a user can pay transaction fees with alternative tokens, such as a dollar stablecoin or, in the future, even a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).\n\nAnother Visa Paymaster contract was deployed, which completely sponsors transaction fees per the second use case.\n\nIn a blog post, Visa explains its current experiment with account abstraction, intending to seek out how the current AA paradigm on Ethereum offers creative solutions for dealing with transaction fees. Can users pay Ethereum transaction fees with stablecoins or other ERC-20 tokens, or not pay them at all?\n\nIt believes the findings of its experiment may help further mainstream crypto adoption."
