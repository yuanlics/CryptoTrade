        "summary": "  In the article, the author discusses the current state of Ethereum and its potential rivals in the smart contract space. Despite the hype around Ethereum killers in 2021, the author notes that Solana and Cardano have faced challenges in recent times, including price crashes and scandals. However, both networks have shown resilience and are still considered relevant in the market.\n\nThe author highlights the differences between Solana and Cardano, with Solana facing criticism for its association with disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, while Cardano is focusing on real-world problems such as digital identity solutions and reaching new users in Africa.\n\nThe article also touches on the Layer 2 solution, which refers to a secondary blockchain built on top of or alongside a main blockchain. Polygon is a notable example of a Layer 2 solution, which has partnered with Mastercard and is being used by several famous brands for their web3 strategies.\n\nOverall, the author suggests that while Ethereum remains firmly placed in the smart contract space, the market is likely to continue to evolve and new alternatives may emerge"

        "summary": "  Sure, here's a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nLayer-2 (L2) blockchains are helping developers build secure decentralized applications (dApps) by providing faster transaction speeds without compromising security. Ethereum is the most popular blockchain for dApp development, but its scalability issues have led to the development of L2 blockchains like Mantle. Mantle is a high-performance L2 network that separates execution, data availability, and transaction finality into separate layers, providing Ethereum-level security while increasing transaction speeds. It also utilizes a decentralized data availability layer and combines it with Ethereum roll-ups, opening up more use cases for developers. Mantle is an example of how L2 blockchains can make Web3 technology more accessible and is a product of BitDAO, a community-owned DAO. As more users and developers gravitate towards platforms like Mantle, the future of Web3 will focus on modular L2 blockchains that can offer Ethereum's trust while delivering lightning-fast speeds."
