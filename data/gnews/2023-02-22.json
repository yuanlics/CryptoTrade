        "content": "Ethereum Layer-2 project Polygon is letting go of some of its staff after merging multiple business units.\n\nIn a blog published Tuesday, Polygon\u2019s founders and president said they would lay off 20% of workers and cut 100 positions. All affected employees will receive three months of severance pay.\n\n\u201cThis was a painfully hard decision, but a necessary step in our journey,\u201d they said.\n\nLast month, Polygon announced a corporate restructuring that combined all staff under \u201cPolygon Labs.\u201d\n\nPolygon\u2019s native token MATIC is among the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. MATIC sank 6.5% following the layoff announcement.\n\nThe token had been the best performer among the top 20 cryptocurrencies over the preceding month, having gained 48%.\n\nAround one year ago, Polygon raised $450 million in venture capital funding in a private token sale led by Sequoia India. Now, the team says its treasury remains \u201chealthy,\u201d with a balance of $250 million and over 1.9 billion MATIC ($2.53 billion).\n\nSeparately on Wednesday, Australian startup Immutable, creator of the NFT-focused Ethereum Layer-2 network Immutable X, disclosed it had slashed 11% of its staff.\n\nImmutable cited a dearth in cash reserves and a push to redirect resources for the cuts, the Sydney Morning Herald reported, noting that it would include shaking up business units.\n\nIt also plans to transfer responsibility of some aspects of game development to external partners so it can focus on its crypto and Web3 components.\n\nA spokesperson called the reporting, \u201ca false attribution,\u201d and told Blockworks that \u201cImmutable did not cite low cash as the reason for this strategic move in February.\u201d\n\nLast year, the firm laid off 6% of its workforce, mostly affecting developers who worked on NFT-centric game Gods Unchained.\n\nGenesis, Crypto.com, Blockchain.com and ConsenSys are among other crypto companies that recently reduced their workforces.\n\nUpdated March 8, 2023 at 5:33 am ET: Added a comment from an Immutable spokesperson.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Alexis Ohanian \u2013 Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of Reddit \u2013 revealed he is an early Ethereum investor and purchased 50,000 ETH during the asset\u2019s presale in 2014.\n\nHis stash is currently worth nearly $82 million.\n\nDecentralization Drove his Investment Decision\n\nThe 39-year-old entrepreneur and investor of Armenian heritage said his ancestors\u2019 tragic history is among the main reasons he is fond of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nIn a recent interview for Forbes, he said some of his great-grandparents were decapitated by Turkish soldiers during the Armenian genocide in 1915. The Ottomans also confiscated his family\u2019s heirloom rugs and other personal belongings.\n\nAs such, Ohanian has become a huge supporter of assets that centralized institutions can not seize:\n\n\u201cAny group of people who have in their consciousness, or in their collective history, some idea of persecution, especially by a state, makes the idea of a store of value that is not controlled by any single state very attractive. And so, in some ways, it was hardwired in me then and made me, in a way, receptive to the idea of a decentralized currency.\u201d\n\nOhanian understood that a blockchain protocol called Ethereum was about to be launched almost a decade ago and invested $15,000 in its native token \u2013 ETH. This means he bought the cryptocurrency for roughly $0.30 per token.\n\nHis investment is now worth approximately $82 million, a staggering 546,000% return. However, Ohanian wished he could have bought more at the time:\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, I didn\u2019t invest nearly as much as I should have.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed in 2021 that he has \u201ca lot\u201d of Ethereum without providing further details.\n\nHis Other Crypto Forays\n\nApart from co-creating Reddit, Ohanian has founded another entity \u2013 the venture capital firm Seven Seven Six. It raised $500 million at the beginning of 2022 to invest in cryptocurrency start-ups and doubled down with another $177 million fundraiser several months later.\n\nOhanian is also a proponent of non-fungible tokens. He purchased an NFT from the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection last summer and gifted it to his wife \u2013 the tennis superstar Serena Williams."

        "content": "Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko announced the Shapella upgrade is scheduled for Feb. 28. The Shapella network upgrade will activate on the Sepolia network at epoch 56832.\n\nShanghai and Capella (Shapella) are the upcoming Ethereum hard fork names. Shanghai is the fork\u2019s name on the execution layer client side, and Capella is the upgrade name on the consensus layer client side.\n\nEthereum Sepolia upgrade schedule. Source: GitHub\n\nSome key Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) changes on the execution layer include warm coinbase (not to be confused with the crypto exchange) and Beacon Chain push withdrawals. The push withdrawals will allow validator withdrawals from the Beacon Chain to the Ethereum Virtual Machine via a new \u201csystem-level\u201d operation type. On the other hand, warm coinbase could be a game changer that reduces network fees for builders.\n\nCoinbase is the name of the software that builders use to receive new tokens on the network. Every new platform transaction must interact with the coinbase software multiple times. The first interaction costs more as the software needs to \u201cwarm\u201d up, with fees declining as the interactions increase. However, with the introduction of EIP-3651, the coinbase software will remain warm to begin with, requiring a lower gas fee to access it.\n\nRelated: Ethereum on-chain data suggests ETH sell pressure could be a non-event after the Shanghai upgrade\n\nMajor changes to the consensus layer include full and partial withdrawals for validators and independent state and block historical accumulators, replacing the original singular historical roots.\n\nPartial withdrawal means validators can withdraw Ether (ETH) rewards in excess of 32 Ether and keep validating. If they want a full withdrawal, validators can fully exit, take all 32 Ether and rewards, and stop doing the work.\n\nThe upcoming upgrade would enable validators to withdraw their staked Ether (stETH) from the Beacon Chain to the execution layer. Moreover, the upgrade would bring changes to the execution and consensus layers, adding new features, making it a key upgrade following the Merge.\n\nStakers and non-stakers who operate nodes must, however, upgrade their nodes to the most recent Ethereum client versions to take advantage of the Sepolia upgrade. After the deployment of the Sepolia upgrade, the next step would be the release of the Shanghai upgrade on the Ethereum Goerli test network, expected to commence in March."

        "content": "NFT marketplaces typically have restrictions on which cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase assets\u2014but Uniswap\u2019s NFT marketplace has just launched a new feature that changes all that.\n\nUniswap NFT traders can now use any token on the Ethereum blockchain, such as stablecoins like USDC or Tether, or even a meme coin like Shiba Inu, to purchase their NFTs through a simplified interface.\n\nHow does it work? According to the crypto startup, Uniswap\u2019s new Universal Router contract \u201cfinds the most cost-efficient route\u201d to complete a swap from any Ethereum-based token into the required token for the NFT sales (in most cases, Ethereum) and then pushes that crypto to OpenSea\u2019s Seaport protocol to finalize the transaction.\n\nUnder the hood, Uniswap is dramatically simplifying the NFT purchasing process for those who might need to swap one cryptocurrency for another before buying an NFT.\n\nThe firm also said it plans to support combined sums of multiple different cryptocurrencies for a single NFT sale soon as well, meaning that if an NFT costs 1 ETH, a trader could buy it with a combination of USDC and Tether, or DAI and SHIB, or Uniswap\u2019s native token UNI and Chainlink, for instance.\n\nWhat does this mean for NFT traders? The new tool is meant for existing Uniswap traders who swap high volumes of tokens already on the platform.
