        "content": "One downside of Ethereum eating the entire world is that similar to the networking industry today, there will be much less variability in some of the network functions that are available. To be interoperable, tokens and smart contracts will basically have to be the same everywhere. Every chain has to be an EVM chain. And while you can have cross-chain development systems that work on a diverse ecosystem, it is not very useful because your tokens and smart contracts become stranded and useless, and the unique and special functions of particular networks never actually get used."

        "content": "As on-chain activity plummets, Ethereum\u2019s blockspace is on track to turn a financial loss for the first time since the Merge, according to Blockworks data.\n\nData from Blockworks Research\u2019s newly-launched Analytics product shows that Ethereum blockspace has consistently turned a profit since the network\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake consensus in September 2022.\n\nThe blockspace profitability metric is calculated by subtracting the total protocol fees paid to validators as well as ether (ETH) reward issuance from total transaction fees.\n\nSource: Blockworks Analytics\n\nFrom October 2022 to present, only in December 2022 did blockspace narrowly turn a loss, generating $3.5 million in losses \u2014 a fraction of the $414 million in gains the protocol has seen so far in 2023.\n\nHowever, as activity on Ethereum falls, September is shaping up to be the protocol\u2019s first month posting significant losses since proof-of-stake was introduced. Throughout September, Ethereum blockspace has posted only a single profitable day, and as of Monday, has accumulated $15.9 million in losses.\n\nThe shift in blockspace profitability coincides with an expansion in ETH\u2019s circulating supply, which is up roughly 8,900 ETH on the month, per data from ultrasound.money.\n\nThe declining profitability for blockspace is attributable to declining user activity and falling volumes across multiple on-chain subsectors. Swaps and transfers of popular stablecoins such as USDT and USDC are down as much as 90% from March 2023 highs, and NFT trading volumes in particular are continuing to dwindle.\n\nSource: Blockworks Analytics\n\nWhile activity on the base layer is shrinking with no clear catalyst to alter the trajectory, a number of Ethereum layer-2 networks are maintaining healthy activity.\n\nArbitrum and Optimism both maintain sequencer profitability, and while each has seen pullbacks in the number of active addresses on the networks, they remain close to yearly highs.\n\nSource: Blockworks Analytics\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

ETH trimmed gains and now consolidating near the $1,630 zone.\n\nEthereum struggled to clear the $1,670 resistance.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,630 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,628 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair must stay above the $1,620 support zone to start a fresh increase in the short term.\n\nEthereum Price Revisits Support\n\nEthereum\u2019s price started a decent increase above the $1,620 resistance. ETH even climbed above the $1,650 resistance before the bears appeared, like Bitcoin.\n\nDuring the increase, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,628 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. However, the bears defended the $1,670 resistance. A high was formed near $1,669 and the price started a downside correction.\n\nThere was a move below the $1,650 level. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,613 swing low to the $1,669 high.\n\nEther is now trading above $1,630 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also trading near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,613 swing low to the $1,669 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,650 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next resistance is near the $1,670 level. A close above the $1,670 resistance might send the price toward the $1,720 resistance. The next major hurdle is near the $1,750 level. A close above the $1,750 level might send Ethereum further higher toward $1,880 in the coming days.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,650 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,630 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe first key support is close to $1,620. The next key support is $1,600. A downside break below $1,600 might start another bearish wave. In the stated case, the price could even decline toward the $1,540 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $1,620\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $1,670\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAccording to new on-chain research, Ether (ETH) is trading below its worth by a staggering 27%.\n\nThe report hinges its analysis on user adoption levels of Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 networks.\n\nLayer 2 networks have ballooned in popularity with Optimism and Arbitrum probing new functionalities.\n\nA new report has placed Ethereum\u2019s network valuation north of $275 billion, relying on a modification of Metcalfe\u2019s Law.\n\nRxR, a joint venture between Re7 Capital and Republic Crypto, has pegged ETH\u2019s fair valuation at $275 billion in its latest analysis. According to the report, the network is currently trading below fair value by 27% if certain key factors are considered holistically.\n\nThe report made use of a modified Metcalfe-centric model to arrive at its conclusion, noting that existing models do not take the scaling dynamics into account. Traditional models place a premium on the number of active users on the network\u2019s mainnet, but RxR\u2019s models rely on data from Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 networks.\n\nMetcalfe\u2019s law states that the financial value of a network is directly proportional to the square of the number of connected users, but extending the model to layer 2 activities yields new results.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s network valuation tracks the updated ML index better when the active user base of Ethereum\u2019s scaling networks is factored into the model than when omitted,\u201d said Lewis Harland, an RxR analyst.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the report, the research analyst noted that including the L2 activity proved more reliable for long-term forecasts. The analysts pointed out that ignoring off-chain and L2 activities may paint a grim picture that the Ethereum network may be overvalued.\n\nAt the moment, ETH trades at $1,655 with a total market capitalization of $199 billion, showing glimpses of a rally on the horizon. RxR\u2019s blended model suggests that contrary to popular opinion, the market is yet to \u201cprice in\u201d Ethereum\u2019s network adoption levels.\n\n\u201cUser growth on Ethereum as an application platform is set to outpace simple value-transfer networks over time implying higher relative valuations based on Metcalfe\u2019s law,\u201d said Harland.\n\nEthereum\u2019s thriving L2 ecosystem\n\nEthereum\u2019s L2 space has been a beehive of activity, with several projects experimenting with novel ways around the network\u2019s scaling issues. Arbitrum and Optimism are pushing the frontiers of Ethereum\u2019s scaling with their novel offerings, with Coinbase\u2019s BASE recording sky-high adoption levels.\n\nWith over 30 L2 networks in play, aggregate total value locked (TVL) has surged to $10 billion given the reliance on rollups and other novel scaling solutions. Experts have hailed the spike in L2 activity as preventing single points of failure and playing a key role in reducing congestion."
