        "content": "Solana (SOL), one of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) biggest competitors, has more than doubled in price since it collapsed to $8.30.\n\nSOL\u2019s local low of $8.30 marked a nearly 97% drop from its all-time highs, and created uncertainty surrounding the future of Solana.\n\nSolana Labs and the Solana Foundation both had exposure to FTX, and the close ties between the organizations put significant sell pressure on SOL.\n\nAt time of writing, however, SOL is up 103% in less than two weeks, currently changing hands at $16.91. Earlier today, SOL hit $17.37, a 109% gain from $8.30.\n\nThe Solana ecosystem is generally seeing improved sentiment, as its own Dogecoin (DOGE) competitor makes waves through the markets.\n\nBonk Coin (BONK) is a meme coin built for the Solana community to re-energize itself following the collapse of FTX and its subsequent effect on SOL. 50% of the total supply of BONK tokens was airdropped to Solana holders, and at time of writing, BONK has a market cap of $51 million.\n\nBONK launched at a price of $0.000000086142 and exploded to a high of $0.00000439 on Thursday, a massive 4,838% gain that vastly outperformed DOGE and Shiba Inu (SHIB). BONK has since cooled off and corrected over 67% at time of writing.\n\nYesterday, Solana Foundation experienced technical difficulties and announced that RPC (remote procedure call) endpoints weren\u2019t working because of a bug found in 1.14. Solana Status, a Twitter page giving updates on the blockchain said that block production and the Solana network were not affected but advised switching back to version 1.13.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Astar Network \u2013 a smart contract innovation hub that connects the Polkadot ecosystem to all Layer 1 blockchains \u2013 launched its Cross-Virtual Machine (XVM) on the public testnet Shibuya.\n\nIt enables projects building on Astar to interact with other smart contract ecosystems, including the WebAssembly (WASM) and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nEnter the XVM\n\nAccording to a document seen by CryptoPotato, Astar Network launched the first major product part of its 2023 strategy \u2013 the Cross-Virtual Machine (XVM).\n\nThe feature is a set of interfaces and a custom pallet that allows smart contracts from one virtual machine to engage with others. The XVM can conduct bi-directional calls between WASM and EVM, regardless of the programming languages the virtual machines employ. Speaking on the development was Hoon Kim \u2013 Chief Technology Officer at Astar Network:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard to create the foundation of the future, regardless of outside influences that are happening now. And today, I am proud to introduce one of our most important features to achieve the Astar Vision; the Cross-Virtual Machine (XVM). It will be the start of the next wave of innovation for dApps. Astar will not only have interoperability through XCM (Cross-chain Messaging) with other parachains but also have interoperability between different smart contract environments.\u201d\n\nThe XVM enables developers to explore numerous contract environments instead of having just one choice. They are also able to build a variety of complex applications that can provide many use cases, such as proving ownership of digital assets.\n\nThe Previous Developments\n\nAstar Network joined forces with the blockchain company Alchemy in August last year to amplify Web3 development on Polkadot\u2019s ecosystem. Astar\u2019s Founder and CEO \u2013 Sota Watanabe \u2013 explained the potential benefits of the partnership:\n\n\u201cSupporting the developer ecosystem is one of Astar\u2019s core values, and our collaboration with Alchemy will help bring even more incentives and innovation to the community. Our collaboration will provide the resources needed to grow the builder community in web3 on Astar, Polkadot, and beyond.\u201d\n\nAstar, which is Polkadot\u2019s leading parachain, inked another collaboration a week later with the DeFi network Acala. The joint initiative aimed to accelerate decentralized finance by introducing new opportunities to developers and rewarding them for their efforts in the Polkadot ecosystem."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Might Lead New Rally, Start Expected in Q1, 2023: Opinion - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nProminent Bitcoin (BTC) mining entrepreneur Jiang Zhuoer, CEO of BTC.TOP and B.TOP mining firms, shared his forecast on the first phase of the next bullish rally in crypto. While the run might start in a few months, its scenario might be different to what we witnessed in previous cycles.\n\nOptimistic and pessimistic forecasts by industry veteran\n\nMr. Jiang Zhuoer took to Twitter to share his estimations of the prospects of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in the next bullish rally. He attempts to compare the ongoing cycle with those of 2014 and 2018. As such, he publishes two scenarios for cryptocurrency bulls, an optimistic and a pessimistic one.\n\n1/ I would like to discuss our current position in the Bitcoin market cycle.\n\nStarting from the previous Bitcoin (BTC) all-time high (ATH) and ending with the next halving, #BTC crossed the bear market bottom in 2014 and 2018, respectively. pic.twitter.com/IAq4U7q0iJ \u2014 Jiang Zhuoer BTC.TOP (@JiangZhuoer) January 9, 2023\n\nIf the November 2022 decline triggered by the FTX drama was the ultimate bottom of this cycle, the four-year period remains valid for every major cycle in crypto. As such, the potential collapse of Digital Currency Group, which is being widely discussed in the media, is already priced in and will not affect the price significantly.\n\nThen, while the new upsurge is almost imminent, the market can follow one of two scenarios. If the optimistic one plays out, the rally might start two months after the last phase of \"sideways\" moves.\n\nThe pessimistic scenario, meanwhile, opens the road to an eight-month painful \"sideways\" period. Thus, cryptocurrency capitalization might start its new rally in early Q4, 2023.\n\nFirst Ethereum (ETH), then Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nAlso, Mr. Jiang Zhuoer is fascinated by the prospects of Ethereum (ETH) compared with Bitcoin (BTC). As this is the first time, Ethereum (ETH) meets with EIP-1559 activated and on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, Ethereum (ETH) is exposed to trivial inflation:\n\nMore specifically, looking at the data of Ethereum (ETH), the inflation rate was 3.59% when ETH was in Proof-of-Work (POW). Bitcoin's inflation rate is 1.72%. Even after the bear market, with the inactive coin burning, the ETH inflation rate is as low as 0.01%.\n\nBesides that, Ethereum's (ETH) price decline during this bearish cycle is only 80% of that of the largest cryptocurrency, which is yet another indicator of Ether's maturity as an asset.\n\nAs such, Ethereum (ETH) will start rising earlier than Bitcoin (BTC); the first spike can be expected between March and May 2023, Mr. Jiang Zhuoer says.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, in March, 2022, Mr. Jiang Zhuoer criticised \"permanent bulls\" for their lack of common sense."

        "title": "Could Ethereum Hit $3,500 in 2023? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "At a recent price of about $1,270, Ethereum (ETH -0.01%) is down nearly 75% from the all-time high of $4,891.70 it touched in November 2021. That stratospheric level now seems like a distant memory for Ethereum investors, who enter 2023 uncertain of what's next for the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Is a potential comeback in the making?\n\nAlthough the idea that it could nearly triple in value this year to $3,500 might sound outlandish, Ethereum was actually trading around $3,500 as recently as April 2022. But it will be a long, difficult path for it to regain that level in 2023.\n\nForget about The Merge\n\nIf there was one catalyst that was supposed to send Ethereum's price skyrocketing in 2022, it was The Merge -- the cryptocurrency's much-anticipated transition from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain. Although The Merge went as planned from a technical standpoint, it didn't from an investment perspective. The meltdown of crypto exchange FTX (FTT 3.89%) occurred about two months after The Merge took place, so we'll never really know what could have been. But we do know what did happen: Ethereum is down by nearly 25% since Sept. 15, the date The Merge took place.\n\nAs a result, investors can basically forget about any price gains driven by that transition this year. Yes, Ethereum has a number of updates planned for the year ahead that will improve the blockchain and increase its efficiency, but none of them will be really earth-shattering. Maybe it's just me, but I can't see Ethereum soaring in price on the basis of hype about \"rollups\" and \"sharding.\" So we're going to have to look elsewhere for catalysts that are capable of driving major gains.\n\nFlight to quality\n\nOne overarching investment trend that could help to buoy the prospects of Ethereum is a flight to quality. If 2022 was the year that investors got burned by holding risky, volatile assets, then 2023 is likely to be the year that they embrace less risky assets. While it might sound crazy to categorize Ethereum as less risky in any way, the fact remains that among cryptocurrencies, there are two that are generally considered to be quality assets on a relative basis: Bitcoin (BTC 0.48%) and Ethereum.\n\nAs a result, we can expect that many investors will continue to move their money out of more speculative tokens and into those two trusted coins. The big picture is that institutional investors increasingly consider crypto to be an asset class all its own, and as such, we can expect a flow of institutional money into Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nEven at the retail investor level, I think we are going to see money flowing into Ethereum as new investment products and trading platforms are created. One good example is the new Fidelity Crypto platform unveiled by Fidelity Investments in late November, which lets investors trade Bitcoin and Ethereum commission-free.\n\nCreation of new market opportunities\n\nEven this flight to quality, however, probably will not be enough to drive a three-fold return for Ethereum in 2023. What would also be needed is the introduction of a brand-new market opportunity that completely changes the game. Given that Ethereum has been a leader when it comes to creating new market categories such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and the metaverse, that type of innovation is not out of the question.\n\nOne new market opportunity that has potential involves customer loyalty programs running on the blockchain. Polygon (MATIC -1.32%), a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is at the forefront of this trend. The brand-new Starbucks (SBUX 0.36%) Odyssey loyalty program, running on Polygon, just launched in early December. Through this program, customers can earn extras such as NFTs and Web3 experiences. If other brands follow suit, this could jump-start a larger trend and generate renewed interest in Ethereum as the go-to blockchain for brands and consumer-facing businesses.\n\nAnother market opportunity involves crypto payments. According to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, this is where all the work that has been done to increase transaction speeds and improve scalability for the Ethereum blockchain can really pay off. Basically, once blockchains can consistently process large amounts of transactions faster than the Visa (V 1.20%) payments network, we could see a migration of payments to the blockchain. As might be imagined, this would be a huge win for Ethereum. Encouragingly, Visa released a technical paper at the end of 2022 that outlined the possibility of recurring payments being handled via Ethereum one day.\n\nThe outlook for Ethereum\n\nI'm cautiously optimistic about Ethereum in 2023. The overall macroeconomic outlook continues to weigh heavily on all cryptos, and it will be a tough task for Ethereum to surge in value if the economy tips into recession.\n\nHowever, I'm super-bullish on Ethereum for the long term. The blockchain continues to generate fantastic new market opportunities on a regular basis. If any of these new opportunities turn out to be home runs, then Ethereum might just be a three-bagger in 2023."
