        "content": "Prominent market analytics firm Santiment says that a trio of altcoins is showing healthy signs moving into 2023.\n\nAccording to the crypto intelligence firm, interoperability blockchain Quant (QNT), metaverse protocol Decentraland (MANA) and Ethereum-based (ETH) gaming blockchain Enjin Coin (ENJ) may have bright futures ahead of them.\n\nSantiment says there is a sharply diminishing supply of the three coins on crypto exchanges, which could bode well for price action this year.\n\n\u201cQuant, Decentraland, and Enjin are among the largest market cap assets that saw significant amounts of coins leaving exchanges in 2022. Though their respective prices are down big, as is the rest of crypto, these are good signs for a better 2023.\u201d\n\nQNT is trading for $105.46 at time of writing while MANA and ENJ are valued at $0.292 and $0.241, respectively.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin (BTC), Santiment says it suffered a \u201csputtering\u201d end to the year as whales and sharks aggressively sold the king crypto asset throughout 2022. The data reveal deep-pocketed investors unloaded $10.75 billion worth of Bitcoin in over 12 months.\n\n\u201cSince two weeks before the Nov. 2021 Bitcoin all-time high, shark and whale addresses holding 10 to 10,000 BTC have dumped a collective $10.75 billion. This drop, combined with circulation drying up, has led to a sputtering end to 2022.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is changing hands for $16,518 at time of writing, a fractional dip during the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Attorney John Deaton has also labeled Bitcoin as security and warned that SEC could soon turn on the digital asset.\n\nEvan Van Ness, an Ethereum maximalist, tweeted that the Bitcoin production block is controlled by two entities.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently in court with Ripple Labs over the security status of XRP. As the case is edging closer to its final ruling, Attorney John Deaton has labeled Bitcoin as security and warned that SEC could soon turn on the digital asset. Evan Van Ness, an Ethereum maximalist tweeted that the Bitcoin production block is controlled by two entities.\n\nMAJORITY OF #Bitcoin BLOCK PRODUCTION CURRENTLY CONTROLLED BY TWO ENTITIES Out of the last 1000 $BTC blocks, 501 have been built by Antpool and FoundryUSA Two pools control more than 50% of block production!\n\nIn response, former SEC enforcement attorney John Reed Stark questioned why the asset is then not regarded as security that requires SEC registration. Stark has suggested that Bitcoin is an unregistered security due to its mining centralization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeaton also responded that the security status of Bitcoin has been a topic of discussion in the past with some SEC officials regarding it as an unregistered security.\n\nThere are others at the SEC who believe the same thing. In 2015, some at the SEC argued BTC was an unregistered security. This is why it\u2019s absurd for Maxi\u2019s like @saylor and @maxkeiser to encourage/celebrate the SEC\u2019s actions \ud83c\udd9a XRP and other tokens. SEC overreach is bad for the USA.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum maximalists\u2019 support for SEC could backfire\n\nDeaton has in the past warned that SEC could turn on Ethereum for switching to Proof of Stake. His mention of Bitcoin maximalists and Ethereum proponents comes as a result of their lack of support in the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit. Michael Saylor and Max Keiser have both shown support for SEC with Saylor claiming Ethereum and Ripple are committing security fraud.\n\nAccording to him, ETH and XRP are unregistered securities and should be shut down. In the past, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also labeled XRP as centralized. Buterin\u2019s position is due to Ripple\u2019s comment in a court filing two years ago that Ethereum was China controlled. In August, Buterin said XRP has lost its protection from the Ethereum community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeaton, however, believes that the support by the anti-Ripple community and the so-called Bitcoin maximalists could come back to bite them.\n\nPerfect picture summarizes the danger of supporting government overreach just because the current overreach doesn\u2019t involve the asset of your choice.\n\nBrad Garlinghouse, Ripple Labs CEO, has called on the entire crypto community to support them, as a victory for the SEC could affect the rest of the digital assets.\n\nU.S. Congress candidate January Walker also made a similar claim.\n\nThe world follows the actions of the USA, and how the government handles one of us, sets precedence for how they handle all of us. Instead of battling against each other claiming one group is better than another we need to work together for the right legislation.\n\nPresident of the Texas Blockchain Council, Lee Bratcher, however, thinks otherwise. According to him, the XRP model fits the Howey test and should be categorized under security.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.
