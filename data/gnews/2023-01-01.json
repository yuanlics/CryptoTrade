        "summary": "  Here is a summary of the article in less than 256 tokens:\n\nThe cryptocurrency market had a dismal 2022, with massive losses across the board, including a 65% loss for Bitcoin and a 68% loss for Ethereum. The bear market is expected to continue in 2023, with the key pattern to watch being the Descending Channel Pattern in the weekly timeframe. If Ethereum continues to trade within this pattern, it could signal more selling pressure and potentially a lower bottom. However, if the ETH price can break above this channel, it could be a sign of a new bull run. The first quarter of 2023 will be critical in determining the trend for Ethereum, and traders should keep an eye on sell setups in the lower timeframes."

        "summary": "  The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering whether Bitcoin is a security, with some lawyers arguing that it could be declared as such and potentially destroy the market. Attorney John Deaton has labeled Bitcoin as a security and warned that the SEC could turn on the digital asset. Evan Van Ness, an Ethereum maximalist, tweeted that the Bitcoin production block is controlled by two entities. Former SEC enforcement attorney John Reed Stark questioned why Bitcoin is not regarded as a security that requires SEC registration. The article also mentions that some SEC officials have discussed Bitcoin's security status in the past. Bitcoin and Ethereum maximalists' support for the SEC could backfire, and some experts believe that the SEC's actions could set a precedent for how they handle other digital assets."
