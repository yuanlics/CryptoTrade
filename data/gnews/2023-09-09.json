        "content": "An investor who accurately called the crypto market bottom in 2022 is expressing bullish sentiment on a leading Ethereum (ETH) competitor.\n\nReacting to an unnamed individual who confessed online to investing a $75,000 bonus in Solana (SOL), Chris Burniske tells his 263,300 followers on the social media platform X that the investment could turn into $2 million.\n\nAccording to the founder of Placeholder Capital and former head of crypto at ARK Invest, his prediction is based on the assumption that Solana will reach a price double its all-time high of about $260 recorded in November of 2021.\n\n\u201cAssumes SOL goes at least 2x former all-time high, which I think likely, but can always be wrong.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading at $19.61 at time of writing and would have to appreciate by approximately 2,551% to reach Burniske\u2019s envisaged price of $520.\n\nEarlier this month, the crypto investor predicted that Solana is likely to outperform Ethereum during the next market rally. According to Burniske, Solana has various factors that give the 10th-largest crypto asset by market cap an edge.\n\n\u201cQuiet product launches, upgraded functionality, lower fees, more throughput, no hype \u2013 all signs of a new product cycle coming to life from the ashes.\u201d\n\nThe crypto investor also recently said that Solana, as well as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum, are unlikely to make new lows in 2023 and that their long-term uptrend will continue into the coming two years.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nPseudonymous cryptocurrency researcher Hildobby, data scientist at Dragonfly VC fund, demonstrates the most generous gas spenders on the Ethereum (ETH) network. Besides \"technical\" addresses associated with wallets controlled by largest CEXes, the operator of an MEV bot becomes the #1.\n\n$70 million for 1.26 million transactions: Meet largest gas spender on Ethereum (ETH)\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) wallet associated with a maximal extractable value (MEV) bot dubbed Jared From Subway (jaredfromsubway.eth) spent almost 38,000 Ethers (ETH) on gas, or over $70 million in equivalent. The bot initiated 1.26 million on-chain transactions, as demonstrated on a Dune dashboard created by Dragonfly's Hildobby.\n\njaredfromsubway.eth has now spent 37k ETH ($70m) on gas, the most of any address on Ethereum \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\n\nsrc: https://t.co/Ftl9QzMJPr pic.twitter.com/TdAeRvvzjJ \u2014 hildobby (@hildobby_) September 8, 2023\n\nAs such, this bot becomes the largest Ethereum (ETH) wallet in terms of gas spending. To provide context, the second position is occupied by one of Binance-controlled wallets with over 7.73 million transactions. It spends on gas less than half of what Jared From Subway transferred to Ethereum (ETH) validators.\n\nIt should also be noted that the Ethereum (ETH) gas price inches closer to multi-month lows. The current gas price is 9.39 Gwei, which means that one Uniswap (UNI) exchange is charged with approximately a $4 fee, as per Etherscan.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) community is thrilled by such impressive statistics of an Ethereum MEV bot. Meanwhile, the net profit or PnL data for the account are yet to be calculated.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, MEV bots are responsible for the majority of trading activity on DEXes. For instance, 80% of Uniswap's (UNI) trading volume across all pairs is generated by AI-powered MEV bots.\n\nWhat is special about MEV bot by JaredFromSubway?\n\nMEV bots are automated mechanisms designed to frontrun pending trades in the Ethereum (ETH) mempool by corrupting validators with higher fees. Once the bot identifies a large transaction, it can manipulate the price of this or that asset and execute the deal with a more attractive price.\n\nThe first signs of activity from the jaredfromsubway.eth-backed bot were registered in February 2023. Experts say that its algorithms are more sophisticated: It managed to have its transactions included in over 60% of Ethereum (ETH) blocks. In April 2023, it was spending over $1.1 million on gas daily.\n\nThe net number of jaredfromsubway.eth victims might exceed hundreds of thousands of DEX traders.\n\nThe bot is named after Jared Scott Fogle, a spokesperson of the American fast food chain Subway. Fogle advertised the restaurants for 15 years before being arrested for child sex tourism and child pornography storage in 2015."

        "title": "Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Price Barely Moved Following Ark\u2019s ETF Application - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The price of Ethereum seems to be back under the influence of the current market sentiment despite enjoying a relatively positive week. On Wednesday, September 6, Ark Invest filed for the first Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nThis ETF application had a tame impact on the price of Ether, with the cryptocurrency only climbing to $1,650 the following day. Moreover, the token has almost fully reversed the minor gains from the significant development.\n\nEthereum Price Registers 0.1% Rise Last Week \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\n\nEthereum currently changes hands at about $1,628, according to data from CoinGecko. A negligible 0.1% price increase in the last seven days underscores the struggling market performance of the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nA spot ETH exchange-traded fund is an investment vehicle that tracks the price of Ethereum on the spot market, allowing investors to buy and sell the crypto asset via a brokerage account. A product of this kind is expected to boost interest and investment in the Ether token.\n\nNevertheless, the price of ETH has remained relatively unmoved this week despite the optimistic news. A recent report by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock has provided insight into why the news barely impacted the price of Ethereum.\n\n\u2018Supply & Demand Balance\u2019\n\nAccording to the data analytics platform, the current supply and demand balance is one of the primary reasons why the ETH price continues to move sideways. \u201cLarge holdings are concentrated close to ETH\u2019s current price, consolidating prices in a tight range,\u201d IntoTheBlock said.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nIntoTheBlock data shows that a total of 5.1 million ETH was acquired below the $1,600 mark to create support, while a total of 6.5 million ETH was purchased at a price above this level to establish resistance. The blockchain analytics firm concluded that traders agree to transact within a narrow range with a large concentration of ETH positions.\n\n\u2018Automated Buying, Discretionary Selling\u2019\n\nAdditionally, IntoTheBlock believes that while bullish traders seemed to have bought the news, \u201cdiscretionary sellers\u201d overtook the narrative not too long after.\n\n\u201cA key factor behind the discretionary selling is likely to be FTX\u2019s upcoming liquidation of reportedly $3B in crypto holdings,\u201d the report read.\n\nWhile FTX has yet to disclose when it intends to execute these liquidations, it is likely that recent activity on the exchange\u2019s wallets alarmed the market.\n\nThis sentiment also seems to be reflected in the performance of SOL after global payment giant VISA disclosed that it will use the Solana network for payment settlements. While the value of SOL jumped by more than 5% to trade above $20 immediately after the announcement, the cryptocurrency is back trading beneath $19.5.\n\nWith the Ethereum and Solana tokens constituting a significant portion of FTX\u2019s holdings, it is likely that the slow market performance of these assets is driven by traders being cautious because of the impending liquidation.\n\nETH price continues to move sideways on the daily timeframe | Source: ETHUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) started the weekend with slightly higher prices than seven days ago.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency currently trades for $25,815, which is an increase of about 0.6% over the week, while its closest runner-up grew 0.8% to change hands at $1,630.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany other leading cryptocurrencies have also posted similar small gains. There are no substantial changes to the price of any of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market capitalization from last weekend, except Stellar (XLM).\n\nXLM holders saw their stash grow 10% over the week, and the token now trades for $0.124846. The rally appears to have been caused by a tweet from the Stellar team, posted on Saturday, that says, \u201cSomething cool is dropping in 10 days.\u201d\n\nIn the news\u2026\n\nAfter the slow news cycles of the last fortnight, this week saw a return to the usual slew of adoption announcements, although any indication of political breakthroughs for crypto over in Washington was pretty thin on the ground.\n\nOn Monday, the London Stock Exchange Group announced that it is using blockchain technology to build an exchange offering tokenized versions of traditional financial assets. LSEG is currently in talks with multiple regulatory bodies about it, including the UK government and HM Treasury.\n\nThat day, European Central Bank executive board member Fabio Panetta took aim at stablecoins issued by private companies like PayPal, which launched its own dollar-pegged PayPal USD (PYUSD) last month.\n\nSpeaking at the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs meeting on Monday, Panetta said his main criticism of PYUSD and similar coins is that \u201cprivate providers of payment services, including PayPal, have no incentive to limit the take-up of their stablecoins or the range of services they provide. Quite the opposite: their objective is to expand their customer base and gain market share.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the other hand, Panetta thinks the proposed European central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital euro, \u201cwould pay due attention to orderly adjustments in the financial sector while offering payment service providers a platform for innovations with pan-euro area reach,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, top-five South Korean financial conglomerate Hana Financial Group announced a partnership between its KEB Hana Bank and crypto custodian BitGo for late 2024.\n\nThe new deal ties a major domestic financial player to the crypto industry, although KEB Hana Bank has already taken steps into blockchain when it opened a digital branch in metaverse platform The Sandbox.\n\nCrypto-friendly payments giant Visa said on Tuesday that it has now expanded its settlement options to include USDC on the Solana blockchain. The company also announced that it was working with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei to allow them to settle using USDC instead of fiat.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)\u2014recognized by the SEC as the designated accounting standard setter for public companies\u2014voted unanimously to change how companies disclose crypto holdings in order to give greater transparency to the trade. The new rules take effect in 2025.\n\nTwo global financial regulators, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the G20\u2019s risk watchdog, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), on Thursday released a white paper outlining their plans for coordinated action to ensure that there is a \u201ccomprehensive policy and regulatory response for crypto-assets [as it] is necessary to address the risks of crypto-assets to macroeconomic and financial stability.\u201d\n\nWhile the paper\u2019s authors acknowledge that crypto doesn\u2019t currently pose a risk to the financial system, they argue that widespread adoption would undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nThe paper recommends constituencies \u201csafeguard monetary sovereignty and strengthen monetary policy frameworks, guard against excessive capital flow volatility and adopt unambiguous tax treatment of crypto-assets\u201d to protect themselves from risks.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies That Could Dwarf Ethereum - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH -1.09%) remains the second-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization, trailing only Bitcoin (BTC -0.71%). Given Ethereum's dominant position in so many key areas of the blockchain world, it can be hard to imagine any other cryptocurrency ever surpassing it.\n\nBut for the past few years, a long line of rivals have attempted to do exactly that. Many of them have been described as \"Ethereum killers,\" due to their superior performance metrics and rapidly growing blockchain ecosystems. And two that particularly stand out right now are Cardano (ADA 4.66%) and Solana (SOL 8.56%). Let's take a closer look at how they might eventually surpass Ethereum over the long haul.\n\n1. Cardano\n\nWith a market cap of nearly $9 billion, Cardano ranks as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency in the world. That might sound impressive, but Ethereum has a market cap of almost $200 billion, so Cardano needs to increase in value by a multiple of 20 to 25 just to reach Ethereum's current size. To dwarf Ethereum, Cardano would likely need to 50x in value.\n\nThat's a big ask, so it's important that the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, also happens to be one of the co-founders of Ethereum. If there's anyone who knows how to out-Ethereum Ethereum, it's Hoskinson. He's been very vocal about the structural flaws of Ethereum in the past, arguing that Cardano has superior blockchain technology. This summer, he even suggested that Cardano would eventually surpass Ethereum and Bitcoin to become the top cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nFrom my perspective, it all starts with decentralized finance (DeFi). But in 2021, Cardano upgraded its blockchain to support the smart contracts required for DeFi, and it has continually made new improvements and upgrades since then. This year, for example, Cardano saw the launch of its first stablecoin, as well as a burst of new activity on decentralized exchanges. If Cardano's DeFi ecosystem continues to grow quickly, this could lead to rapid gains in valuation.\n\nMoreover, growth in emerging markets could send Cardano soaring. As Hoskinson outlined in a recent interview, Cardano is looking for blockchain partners across Africa, South America, Asia, and the Middle East. If Cardano becomes the most popular blockchain network in these regions, then it could have a massive impact on its future valuation.\n\n2. Solana\n\nSimilar in size to Cardano, Solana has a market cap of $8 billion. So it will need the same types of growth catalysts as Cardano to ever surpass Ethereum. In short, Solana needs a big, think-outside-the-box idea to drive 50-fold valuation gains.\n\nAnd that big idea might just be mobile crypto. Back in summer 2022, Solana first unveiled its strategic vision for mobile crypto, including a new flagship Android-based mobile device optimized for crypto and a software development kit to help developers around the world build for mobile crypto. It sounded like a lot of hype, but this spring, Solana finally launched its Saga crypto phone. The concept was simple but brilliant: Everything you do on your phone involving crypto should be simple and intuitive, and you should be able to bring crypto with you wherever you go.\n\nThe problem is that the collapse of FTX last year had disastrous implications for Solana, which had extensive links to former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. All the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) swirling around Solana since the FTX meltdown has taken a toll on the Solana ecosystem. Some high-profile NFT collections, for example, decided to migrate to other blockchains this year, and overall activity on the Solana ecosystem has just started to regain its previous footing. The good news is that Solana is up more than 100% for the year, so the worst may be behind it.\n\nWhat are the chances of overtaking Ethereum?\n\nFor either Cardano or Solana to ever overtake Ethereum, a lot has to go right. The fact that there have been so many purported \"Ethereum killers,\" and none of them have ever managed to unseat Ethereum tells you a lot. The bottom line is that it's very difficult to overtake a market leader with a first-mover advantage, especially within the tech sector.\n\nIf forced to choose between Cardano and Solana, I'd pick Solana. This is a crypto that is not just trying to out-Ethereum Ethereum, it's actually proposing a new approach to blockchain technology based around mobile. For me, that's an exciting concept and a big reason why I think Solana might just pull off what many people think is impossible."
