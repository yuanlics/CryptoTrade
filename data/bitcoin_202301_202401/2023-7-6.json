        "title": "Bitcoin touches a 13-month high as the drumbeat for institutional demand grows louder - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nBitcoin touched a 13-month high on Thursday as the drumbeat for institutional bitcoin demand grew louder following comments from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. The cryptocurrency ended the day flat at $30,302.03, according to Coin Metrics. Early in the morning, it climbed to about $31,450, reaching its highest level since June 2022. It gave back those gains, however, after better-than-expected U.S. jobs data increased investor worries about path of interest rates. The earlier move was in contrast to both weaker stock prices and rising yields \u2014 the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note later climbed above 4% to a 16-year high. Additionally, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's June meeting, released Wednesday, showed that most officials would support more rate increases ahead. Cryptocurrency liquidity has been low for several months, continuing to exaggerate both up and down moves.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back Thursday following better-than-expected U.S. jobs data.\n\n\"There is still a weight on the price,\" said Noelle Acheson, economist and author of the \"Crypto is Macro Now\" newsletter. \"We have often over the past few weeks seen selling resistance at around $31,000. That will eventually be broken, but meanwhile traditional markets seem to be entering a more risk-off mood \u2013 we can't yet assume that bitcoin will just shrug that off.\" Sentiment among traders was high though, after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink gave bitcoin perhaps its biggest ever endorsement from a major institutional player. Speaking on Fox Business News on Wednesday, Fink called bitcoin \"an international asset\" and said it's \"not based on any one currency so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.\" Bitcoin has steadily climbed since June 15, when BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, first filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. The number of coins held by institutions through trusts, ETFs and funds has spiked since then, reaching its highest level in more than a year, according to CryptoQuant, and bitcoin open interest is back to pre-FTX levels."

After the Securities and Exchange Commission said BlackRock\u2019s application was missing information, Nasdaq, which hopes to list the ETF, refiled the application on Monday. The SEC has never accepted an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF, which invests directly in the cryptocurrency.\n\nLast month, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Citadel Securities also backed a new exchange, EDX Markets, that wants to offer crypto trading via a middle ground between the worlds of traditional finance and Web3.\n\nThe entry of traditional financial firms has helped buoy the price of Bitcoin above $30,000 for the past few weeks and has spurred millions of dollars in inflows to the market.\n\nLast week, investors poured $125 million into some of the most popular digital asset investment products, bringing the total invested over the previous two weeks to $334 million, according to a report by CoinShares. Bitcoin represented 98% of the inflows during that period."

        "content": "The CEO of the world\u2019s largest asset manager likened the world\u2019s largest digital asset, bitcoin, to digital gold in an appearance on Fox Business Wednesday.\n\nLarry Fink said he hopes BlackRock\u2019s bitcoin ETF \u2014 should it be approved \u2014 could help \u201cdemocratize\u201d crypto and help investors get exposure to cryptocurrency for \u201cmuch cheaper.\u201d\n\nBut Fink hasn\u2019t always been this optimistic when it comes to bitcoin (BTC).\n\nLong before BlackRock applied for a spot bitcoin ETF, he thought of the digital asset only in terms of its potential to facilitate money laundering.\n\n\u201cBitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world,\u201d Fink said in October 2017 at an Institute of International Finance meeting.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all it is,\u201d he said. Bitcoin would go on to reach an all-time high at the time of around $19,700 two months later.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t nearly as harsh as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, however. Around the same time as Fink\u2019s money laundering comments, Dimon called people who own any form of crypto \u201cstupid\u201d and said bitcoin was a \u201cfraud.\u201d\n\nRead more: Tudor Jones on Bitcoin: \u2018I\u2019ve Never Sat on a Horse That Long\u2019\n\nLess than a year later, Fink\u2019s attitude on bitcoin, crypto and blockchain were already beginning to moderate.\n\nIn July 2018, he told Reuters that BlackRock is \u201ca big student of blockchain,\u201d but that he personally didn\u2019t see \u201chuge demand for cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nThe day Reuters published that interview, July 16, 2018, the high price of bitcoin (BTC) was $6,741.75.\n\nFast forward to the beginning of December 2020, when bitcoin was pushing $20,000 for the second time in its history, Fink again changed his tune.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has caught the attention and the imagination of many people. Still untested, pretty small relative to other markets,\u201d he said. \u201cCan it evolve into a global market? Possibly.\u201d\n\nIt appears that possibility has turned into a reality in mid 2023, with BlackRock and a litany of other firms now filing for spot bitcoin ETFs in a bid to capitalize on an industry with $1.19 trillion market cap.\n\nHis firm\u2019s future involvement in offering crypto spot products is entirely dependent on the SEC\u2019s approval. BlackRock and other entrants have now tapped Coinbase as part of their surveillance-sharing agreements in part to assuage the SEC\u2019s fears about a lack of information about them.\n\nBlackRock also plans to have Coinbase serve as its crypto custodian for its iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "More than a year after cryptocurrency markets crashed, there\u2019s ample evidence that the economic benefits that many mayors claimed that digital currencies would bring their cities didn\u2019t stick, according to a new paper from researchers at the Brookings Institution.\n\nWhile benchmark crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum have recovered somewhat from their 2022 lows, there are plenty of mayor-led initiatives involving cryptocurrencies that collapsed. MiamiCoin, the bespoke token that Mayor Francis Suarez once touted as a future source of municipal revenue, was delisted in March after losing more than 99% of its value. In Chicago, a universal basic income project for formerly incarcerated people was thrown into jeopardy last year after FTX \u2014 the crypto exchange funding it \u2014 declared bankruptcy and saw its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, indicted on charges of fraud and money laundering.\n\nThose episodes and others should be taken as tough lessons for mayors about hyping up an emerging technology as the key to economic boom times, and why more deliberate and holistic approaches are needed, the Brookings paper argues.\n\nThe paper was authored by Tonantzin Carmona, a Brookings fellow who\u2019s warned about cities chasing their crypto dreams, as well as by Brookings fellows Mark Muro and Sifan Liu, who study technology and economic development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDespite some state and local governments\u2019 efforts to attract crypto activity, few of the associated startups and jobs have been stable or sustainable,\u201d they write. \u201c[The] most recent accountings suggest that in most cases, crypto-related business booms left behind few long-term job or startup gains. Instead, in many cases, what they did create were troubling pollution and energy costs, failed business projects, major consumer and investor losses, and an outbreak of fraud that local law enforcement struggled to curb.\u201d\n\nEven in the financial and tech hubs, cryptocurrency-related jobs were never an overwhelming trend \u2014 the industry never accounted for more than 0.15% of all job listings even in the most vibrant markets. And job losses have extended well beyond just the coin projects and exchanges that ended in disgrace \u2014 according to CoinDesk, nearly 30,000 crypto-related jobs have been eliminated since April 2022.\n\nBut there are lessons cities can learn from the crypto industry\u2019s shrinkage, the Brookings authors write. Any future endeavors hoping to leverage an emerging technology should be undertaken with a \u201cpragmatic baseline examination\u201d of the technology\u2019s inner workings and use cases, they write.\n\n\u201cAs local leaders move beyond the crypto debacle, they should ask themselves hard questions about the future emerging technology opportunities they come upon,\u201d the paper reads, urging leaders to take close looks at how an emerging industry would fit into the existing local tech economy and whether it will create a stable and sustainable job market.\n\nCity leaders should also aim to focus any such endeavors on what the paper\u2019s authors call an \u201cinnovation ecosystem\u201d \u2014 the community of government agencies, higher education institutions, employers, workforce organizations and other entities that have skin in a regional economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe collapse of the crypto bubble in most, if not all, places ought to nudge local leaders toward other strategies for regional economic development,\u201d the paper reads. \u201cIt should also be taken as a useful caution: Not all emerging technologies are promising, no matter how much they are hyped.\u201d"

        "content": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son of former U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, speaks during the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami Beach, Florida, May 19, 2023.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democratic candidate for president, stood at the world's biggest bitcoin conference in Miami in May and told the crowd, \"I am not an investor and I am not here to give investment advice.\" Then he announced he would be accepting campaign donations in bitcoin.\n\nWhat Kennedy didn't tell the crowd was that his family had invested in bitcoin recently, according to a financial disclosure form he filed June 30. On the twelfth page of the report, Kennedy lists a brokerage account that held between $100,001 and $250,000 worth of bitcoin. Hours after publication of this story, Kennedy's campaign manager, former Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich, told CNBC that the bitcoin purchase was made after the speech in Miami and before the June 30 filing deadline.\n\nThe situation could represent a conflict of interest if Kennedy were touting bitcoin on the campaign trail while his immediate family held the cryptocurrency, according to Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel for watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\n\"There is no conflict here,\" Kucinich told CNBC in a follow-up interview.\n\nSince the conference, Kennedy has continued to tout bitcoin.\n\nIn late June, he tweeted: \"Bitcoin is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and the manipulation of our money supply, it points the way toward a future in which government institutions are more transparent and more democratic.\" The tweet includes a video of part of his Miami speech where he describes how he would be pro-bitcoin as president.\n\nThe filing says the bitcoin holding made less than $201 in income but doesn't say when it was purchased. Nor does the filing say who purchased it or how much the family may have spent on their original investment. It also doesn't say whether they sold their bitcoin holding.\n\nThe bitcoin holding is listed under a section on the form that includes assets that can also belong to spouses and dependent children. It is intended to reflect holdings from the \"preceding calendar year and current year to filing date,\" according to the Office of Government Ethics. Kennedy is married to \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" star Cheryl Hines and has six children. Kennedy signed and filed the disclosure form to the Office of Government Ethics at the end of last month, according to the document.\n\nAfter CNBC made multiple attempts to get a comment, the Kennedy campaign said hours after the publication of this story that \"the investments were not his, but his wife's. He is not involved in her investment decisions.\" The campaign did not say for how long Hines held the bitcoin investment or when she purchased the asset.\n\nLater Friday, however, a campaign representative sent a new statement, saying the bitcoin investment is indeed Kennedy's. \"I was mistaken in my last communication. Mr. Kennedy does hold a bitcoin investment, but it came later. At the time of the bitcoin speech he had no cryptocurrency holdings,\" the representative said.\n\nBefore the Kennedy campaign commented, CREW's Canter said the ownership is certainly current as of June 30, when he filed his disclosure. \"Under a traditional conflict of interest analysis, Hines' financial interests are imputed to him,\" Canter said.\n\n\"I'm really concerned that he's speaking at this conference, touting this investment to potential voters while the family has a history of owning bitcoin. It's like he could do the same thing for Procter and Gamble,\" she added. \"There's no difference in my mind from a conflicts perspective.\"\n\nAfter Kennedy's appearance in May at the Miami conference, CNBC inquired whether Kennedy had any crypto holdings. \"Mr. Kennedy has no crypto holdings,\" a spokeswoman for the campaign said at the time.\n\nKennedy said at the conference that if he were to become president he would \"make sure that your right to hold and use bitcoin is inviolable.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration has waged an aggressive fight in regard to cryptocurrencies. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler told CNBC in June \"we don't need more digital currency\" after the SEC sued crypto exchange Coinbase for allegedly acting as an unregistered broker and exchange.\n\nBitcoin's price has seen an upswing recently, hitting a 13-month high Thursday, despite parts of the crypto industry seeing headwinds.\n\nKennedy's campaign has seized attention from several wealthy supporters, even as he remains far behind Biden in Democratic primary polls. A Quinnipiac survey from June shows Biden with 70% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, while Kennedy has 17%. Kennedy, 69, is the son of former Attorney General and U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, both of whom were assassinated in the 1960s.\n\nKennedy's pro-bitcoin stance has aligned him with several top tech investors, such as billionaire and bitcoin enthusiast Jack Dorsey, with several of them offering support for his presidential run. Others include David Sacks, Chamath Palihapitiya and Omeed Malik.\n\nKennedy, who has come under fire for spreading misinformation about vaccines at large, has a history of boosting bitcoin. His nonprofit, Children's Health Defense, or CHD, also has an interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nIts 2021 tax records show under the \"investments\" section that the group had crypto valued at over $78,000. A spokeswoman for CHD, which reportedly played a key role in pushing back on Covid vaccines and helping elevate Kennedy's profile before he began to run for president, previously told CNBC that the cryptocurrencies listed were not \"investments\" but, in fact, \"donations.\" The CHD website shows that bitcoin is one of the cryptocurrencies accepted for donations toward the nonprofit group.\n\nIn April, before he started running for president, Kennedy tweeted what appeared to be an endorsement of bitcoin being a tool to avoid impacts from a struggling U.S. economy.\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin give the public an escape route from the splatter zone when this bubble invariably bursts,\" Kennedy said.\n\nIn May, days before he took the stage at the Miami bitcoin conference, Kennedy tweeted: \"Cryptocurrencies, led by bitcoin, along with other crypto technologies are a major innovation engine. It is a mistake for the U.S. government to hobble the industry and drive innovation elsewhere.\"\n\nA day later he tweeted: \"Bitcoin has been a lifesaver for people's movements around the world.\""

Wood, the firm\u2019s CEO and founder, says the timing of the filing, which came after the SEC rejected earlier such bids by ARK and similar firms, could put her company in position to launch the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S.\u2014and gain a significant first-mover advantage in a new market.\n\nDuring our conversation, Wood shared her views on the broader potential of Bitcoin, the challenges of navigating the regulatory landscape, and her vision for the future of digital assets.\n\n(This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.)\n\nCan you describe how the idea of starting ARK Invest first came to you?\n\nI saw the traditional asset management world, especially after the tech and telecom bust and the 2008-09 meltdown, move towards passive and benchmark sensitive strategies, and away from innovation. And I said: \u201cNo, we have to focus on innovation because there are five major platforms evolving now.\u201d That includes multiomics (DNA) sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology\u2014all evolving at the same time.\n\nAnd these innovations are going to cause explosive growth\u2014what we\u2019re calling super-exponential growth\u2014that we don\u2019t think people understand. But what they\u2019re also going to do is to cause a lot of disruption in the traditional world order. So, we wanted to focus exclusively on the change, and we wanted to educate people, so we give our research away. We have an open-research ecosystem. We are very happy when people comment on our research, especially if they\u2019re working in innovative areas. Give us more ideas, criticize or battle test our assumptions. So those are the main reasons.\n\nWhat about your involvement in crypto and blockchain? I read you started investing personally back in 2015. Can you tell us about your first impression of Bitcoin and this technology?\n\nYes, we had been curious about Bitcoin from 2011. Our chief futurist, Brett Winton, was fascinated by it. So, we started talking about it regularly, and when we started ARK, we wanted to dedicate resources to it. Now we have three crypto analysts.\n\nIn 2015, our analysts wrote a paper. And I asked my mentor, who\u2019s a good friend also now, Art Laffer, a very well-known economist, to read it and criticize it. And when he understood what Bitcoin was, he said: \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve been waiting for since we went off the gold-exchange standard.\u201d And I said to him then: \u201cOkay, then this is a very big idea.\u201d\n\nThis was in 2015, when it was $250. And we took our first position and gained exposure to Bitcoin through GBTC, the Grayscale Investment Trust, in 2015 for our ETFs.\n\nBlackRock just filed for a Bitcoin ETF, but ARK, along with investment company 21Shares, filed its initial application for a Bitcoin ETF back in April. Do you think this attempt will be successful attempt after earlier ones failed?\n\nWell, many people think BlackRock knows something about the SEC. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. We think that this has been in process for a while. But with the Grayscale trial [challenging the SEC\u2019s refusal to allow a spot Bitcoin ETF] coming to a conclusion pretty soon\u2014maybe August\u2014if the SEC loses that case, then the odds go up of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAnd we have our filing. The SEC has until around mid-January to approve it. BlackRock is through March. So, they were probably thinking: Okay, this is a call option potentially on the SEC looking more favorably on a Bitcoin ETF, especially because they\u2019ve approved not only Bitcoin futures ETFs, but now it seems that they\u2019re approving a leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF. And futures involve swaps, whereas a Bitcoin Spot ETF, at least the Grayscale version, is backed fully by Bitcoin in cold storage. So, a spot exchange seems to us to be much safer\u2014and the SEC\u2019s approval process has been contradictory from our point of view.\n\nAnd how much will it change, in your opinion, the development of the crypto industry if the SEC approves Bitcoin spot ETF finally?\n\nOne of the things we\u2019ve been worried about is the SEC chasing innovation away from the U.S. Innovation is in the U.S.\u2019s DNA, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re happy that the judicial branch of government and the legislative branch of government are getting involved. So, what this probably means is we will stop chasing away innovation once we get rules of the road fully in place. We\u2019ll bring back more of the innovation, and it\u2019ll be a global phenomenon. We\u2019re pretty excited that there are many other innovation hubs that want to make this happen, and we want to help them make this happen as well, because it is a global movement.\n\nDo you think that there may be an outcome where the SEC will do a favor to BlackRock, and will approve their spot Bitcoin ETF, but reject yours?\n\nWe don\u2019t think so. We know that there was a surveillance clause in their prospectus that ours didn\u2019t include, but what I\u2019m told is it won\u2019t take much time for us to amend our prospectus, and that all of the exchanges are moving in this direction. [ARK amended its application to add a surveillance clause shortly after this interview.]\n\nOther major crypto news includes the recent launch of EDX, which separates trading and custody, while other big players like Citadel Securities and Fidelity are getting into crypto. Your thoughts?\n\nYes, I think institutional development was thrown off by FTX last year and all of the turmoil, and by the Wells notice and the lawsuits, especially the Coinbase lawsuit by SEC. But I think we\u2019ve seen the worst, and the outcome is interesting. We\u2019re finding that institutions want to learn more, and they\u2019re becoming more sophisticated. So, they want to be ready for a new asset class, if this truly is a new asset class from their point of view, and we think it is."

        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nAfter contentious rumors and a re-filing with the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC), major investment management firm BlackRock\u2019s proposal to launch a long-awaited Bitcoin ETF may soon meet regulatory approval.\n\nOne of the most anticipated developments in the world of Bitcoin financialization is the concept of the Bitcoin ETF, which has yet to be approved for the U.S. financial ecosystem. Essentially, an ETF (exchange-traded fund) is a pooled investment security, a financial instrument that ties its value to that of some external source like a collection of commodities, stock indices or other types of asset. In other words, a Bitcoin ETF would be a security that corporate and individual investors could purchase to speculate on Bitcoin\u2019s success without actually owning the crypto asset directly.\n\nAlthough the number of people getting into Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has gone up over the years, a Bitcoin ETF would make the leading cryptocurrency vastly more accessible and potentially give millions of new investors skin in the game. Understandably then, the possibility of such a product becoming a reality has been making headlines for years, and while many have filed for regulatory approval of Bitcoin-focused ETFs, none have been approved by regulators in the U.S.\n\nBut the entrance of BlackRock as the latest financial firm to submit a Bitcoin-focused ETF proposal to the SEC, is particularly notable. This leading legacy firm has a near-perfect track record in obtaining ETF approvals. Following initial document filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF last month, the cryptocurrency market seemed to take heart, with bitcoin reaching one-year highs shortly after the application.\n\nAlthough the SEC has long signaled concern over the volatility of crypto assets, momentum now seems to favor bitcoin, with BlackRock potentially offering a product never seen before in the space. Although many comparisons can be made between this and previous existing products, an approval here could mark a new era for mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin.\n\nAs the bitcoin price appears to be rallying merely from the rumor of such a product, it seems likely that an actual approval would bring even more price momentum.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

We look at this as an opportunity to move one step further in terms of providing investors fractions of shares, fractions of this, democratizing the cost of investing,\" he added.\n\nFink admitted he was skeptical of crypto in the past, given its use for \"illicit activities\". But the pessimism has since given way to a more upbeat outlook. \"I do believe the role of crypto is digitizing gold in many ways,\" he said.\n\nWhile crypto enthusiasts tend to tout the advantages of bitcoin and digital assets in general, virtual currencies come with some inherent risks. That includes the asset class's extreme volatility - so far in 2023, bitcoin has rallied almost 90% after plunging 64% last year. It jumped almost 60% in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt last check on Thursday, the world's largest cryptocurrency was up 2.27% to trade at $31,481.75, according to CoinMarketCap."

        "content": "The first six months of the year have been extraordinary for Bitcoin (BTC -0.16%). The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now up more than 80% for the year, and analysts are increasingly bullish about the crypto's long-term prospects. In fact, some analysts are now predicting that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nBut what if you are not ready to hold Bitcoin directly in your portfolio? Well, there's another way to get access to the upside potential of Bitcoin without taking on as much risk, and it comes in the form of MicroStrategy (MSTR 10.85%), an enterprise software stock that's up almost 170% for the year. The company holds a tremendous amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet, and that's what makes it a fantastic indirect play on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin on the balance sheet\n\nIn August 2020, MicroStrategy became the first publicly-traded company to buy Bitcoin as part of its capital allocation strategy. Since then, MicroStrategy has been binge-buying Bitcoin and the company's founder, Michael Saylor, has become one of the biggest Bitcoin bulls in the world. The company now holds more than $4.6 billion worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. That's far more than even Coinbase, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nMoreover, MicroStrategy shows no signs of letting up on its Bitcoin strategy. Over the past two months, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, the company bought another 12,000 Bitcoins worth $347 million. The company now holds 152,333 Bitcoins on its balance sheet, worth about $4.6 billion. By way of comparison, the total market capitalization of MicroStrategy is about $4.9 billion. Thus, the market is essentially saying that the total value of Bitcoin accounts for almost all of the company's market value.\n\nSafer than Bitcoin?\n\nMicroStrategy was founded 34 years ago and is generally considered to be one of the top business intelligence software providers in the world. The company has clients in a number of different segments, including retail, financial services, healthcare, technology, and the public sector. And it's all those paying customers who provide a certain margin of safety. Even if the crypto market were to crash, the company would still have a sustainable software business to fall back on.\n\nRight now, MicroStrategy is modestly profitable. In the first quarter of 2023, for example, MicroStrategy posted a gross profit of $94 million, nearly identical to the $93.6 million gross profit that it posted in the year-earlier period. As long as the company can increase its enterprise software business, this number should continue to tick upward. For example, the company is now getting involved with artificial intelligence in order to find new ways to embed AI functionality into its core enterprise analytics packages. And the company is also working on ways to provide Bitcoin payment solutions to clients.\n\nA proxy for Bitcoin\n\nThe big caveat here, of course, is that MicroStrategy appears to be extremely correlated with the price of Bitcoin. Thus, the price of MicroStrategy increases if the price of Bitcoin rises. And, conversely, the price of MicroStrategy falls if the price of Bitcoin declines. This chart below, showing the relationship between Bitcoin and MicroStrategy in 2023, says it all:\n\nData by TradingView\n\nIn short, there's a good reason some institutional investors view MicroStrategy stock as a proxy for holding Bitcoin. The company simply holds so much Bitcoin right now -- equivalent to nearly 0.7% of all Bitcoin in circulation -- that the market is valuing it as an indirect play on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nAs MicroStrategy itself pointed out in its last earnings release in May, one major prong of its corporate strategy is to acquire and hold Bitcoin. And there's no reason to think that MicroStrategy is going to pull back on its current Bitcoin strategy anytime soon.\n\nThus, if you're bullish on Bitcoin, then you should be bullish on the prospects of MicroStrategy. With MicroStrategy, you can get access to the upside of Bitcoin without all the risk of investing in cryptocurrency directly."

Bear markets, however, are definitely part of our reality.\n\nStill, relying on legacy finance definitions of bull and bear markets to map bitcoin cycles is a fool\u2019s errand.\n\nThe old ways dictate that bear markets begin when an asset drops 20% from recent highs and end when they rise 20% from local lows. The S&P 500 was declared to have exited its bear market about one month ago under these very conditions.\n\nIf those rules truly mapped to crypto, bitcoin (BTC) would\u2019ve shed its most recent bear market sometime in early January, when BTC crossed $20,000 after crashing below $16,500 as FTX went kaput.\n\nBitcoin just finished a very long stretch of negative year-on-year returns\n\nAnother strategy riffs on those guidelines. A bear market would be over when bitcoin trades 20% above recent lows for one month or more. Bitcoin did just that this year, when it stayed above $18,800 throughout January until mid-February.\n\nHere\u2019s one more method: Bitcoin is in a bear market when its year-on-year returns are negative. It\u2019s in a bull market when the opposite is true.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then bitcoin exited its longest bear market ever on June 12, just a few days after the S&P.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s year-on-year returns were negative for 490 days \u2014 a new record.\n\nReturns reached as low as -83.6% across that period.\n\nThe previous record was 353 days between November 2014 and October 2015\n\nThe 2023-2023 line is much longer than the others\n\nBitcoin would\u2019ve entered the most recent bear market early last February, when it traded for $44,000 \u2014 around 35% below its $69,000 high set in November 2021.\n\nIt\u2019s a very basic hypothetical. Nevertheless, it would imply that bitcoin has been in a bull market for the past 24 days. BTC\u2019s year-on-year returns have hit more than 61% in that time.\n\nMost probably, it\u2019s too early to say that we\u2019re back. Don\u2019t let that dampen your parade, especially if you\u2019ve been holding since at least the start of last year.\n\nCongratulations, you just survived the longest bear market in history. You\u2019re now a crypto veteran, for better or worse.\n\nDavid is an Editor based in the Netherlands focused on data-driven journalism.

Crypto investor appetite subsided as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made no official comment on Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications and executives quit Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin breaches US$31,195 following Fidelity\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application\n\nBitcoin reclaims US$30,000, Ether trades below US$1,900, top 10 cryptos in the red\n\nBitcoin rose 0.39% from 7:20 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong to US$30,036, recovering above the US$30,000 psychological threshold, after it fell as low as US$29,820 earlier today.\n\nEther inched up 0.32% in the same period to trade at US$1,857 after it slipped below the US$1,900 psychological level yesterday.\n\nRisk appetite subsided, as investors continued to await the SEC \u2018s response to the mounting spot Bitcoin ETF applications, including BlackRock\u2019s recently refiled application.\n\n\u201c[BlackRock\u2019s new filing] may indeed increase the chances, but we can\u2019t say surely how fast it will be approved,\u201d wrote Oleh Pyvovarenko, crypto trader and chief executive officer of 2PMarketing blockchain agency, in a statement to Forkast.\n\n\u201cI believe that we will see a Bitcoin ETF in the near future since the SEC can\u2019t ignore this when such companies as BlackRock are willing to create it and put liquidity in it.\u201d\n\nContributing to poor investment sentiment, Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann and Vice-President for Compliance Steven Christie said they are leaving the world\u2019s largest exchange, citing personal reasons. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao in a tweet called the departures normal \u201cturnover\u201d for large organizations.\n\nHowever, a Fortune report citing unnamed sources and published before Hillmann and Christie confirmed they were leaving, said the executives were quitting due to disappointment over how Zhao was dealing with regulatory investigations of the company.\n\nZhao in his tweet said the reasons for the departures dreamed up by the \u201cnews\u201d are completely wrong.\n\nLitecoin saw the biggest loss in the top 10, falling 7.51% to US$96.28, followed by Dogecoin that lost 3.65% to US$0.06527.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 2.68% to US$1.17 trillion and market volume increased 36.56% to US$46.15 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales rise, Ethereum NFT sales fall but Azuki starts recovery\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index inched down 0.05% to 2,779.11 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 2.9% during the week.\n\nAfter a weaker Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales increased 65.22% to US$4.51 million, as sales for Uncategorized Ordinals rose 1.27% to US$2.41 million.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales fell 11.7% to US$17.26 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, fell 9.68% to US$2.93 million.\n\nAzuki sales rose 32.96% to US$1.58 million, as the collection started recovering from the backlash over the new Azuki Elementals collection that was criticized for being too similar to the original collection.\n\n\u201cThe big NFT collections who saw large decreases in their floor prices have regained some footing, and now are bouncing up or down around 5% instead of the massive double-digit swings they were seeing earlier this week and last week,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nBesides the Forkast 500 NFT index, the Forkast ETH NFT Composite was the only one in the red, falling 0.14% to 945.46 points.\n\nAsian equities, U.S. stock futures fall amid mounting U.S.-China trade tensions\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities fell as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, as investors remained cautious in expectation of China\u2019s inflation data for June, scheduled for next week.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 1.17% and the Shenzhen Component Index fell 0.73%. The Shanghai Composite decreased 0.28% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index fell 0.90%, plunging 2.9% for the week.\n\nInvestor appetite took a hit amid semiconductor trade tensions between Beijing and Washington, after China filed a complaint against U.S. export curbs, alleging that Washington was abusing sales controls to maintain its leadership in the tech and manufacturing sectors.\n\nU.S. stock futures also fell during Friday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, amid growing Sino-U.S. tensions. The S&P 500 futures index inched down 0.028%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.079% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.026%.\n\nTreasury Secretary Yellen began a four-day visit to China on Thursday, with little expectations from both sides, yet investors hope that her meetings will stabilize the fractured relations between the two nations.\n\nThe monthly U.S. jobs report showed that private sector employers added 497,000 jobs in June, far exceeding the 220,000 estimate, which reinforces expectations that the Fed will hike interest rates this month.\n\nThe U.S. services purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 53.9 in June, according to the Institute for Supply Management on Thursday, which beats Reuters\u2019 projection of 51. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 a contraction.\n\nThe data added to concerns that the Federal Reserve will continue its campaign of raising rates and holding them higher for longer periods to tackle inflation. The Fed meets on July 26 to make its next decision on interest rates, after leaving them unchanged in June at between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 92.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, up from 88.7% on Thursday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at just 7.6%.\n\nInvestors now anticipate June\u2019s payrolls report scheduled for Friday, which is expected to show an easing in jobs growth.\n\nSee related article: EU publishes draft bill for digital euro and cash payments\n\n(Corrects paragraph six to show Binance executives cited personal reasons for resignations, adds detail in paragraphs seven, eight.)"

Six months later, its fleet numbered 149,900 \u2014 yielding an operational hash rate of 17.7 EH/s \u2014 Marathon revealed in a July 5 production report.\n\nThe company had a goal of reaching 23 EH/s by mid-year, a mark Marathon CEO Fred Thiel said in a statement can be fulfilled via \u201cfinal steps\u201d at facilities in Ellendale, North Dakota, and Garden City, Texas.\n\n\u201cThe final building in Ellendale is expected to come online this month, and final Garden City tie-in is also expected within that same period,\u201d Thiel added.\n\nRead more: Marathon CEO: \u2018Diversity in Site Mix\u2019 Is Key to Future Growth\n\nAnother company that has more than doubled its hash rate this year is New York-based Cipher Mining, which stood at 6.7 EH/s last month \u2014 up from 2.8 EH/s at the end of 2022.\n\nComing in with a slightly lower hash rate, but with an even higher high growth is Iris Energy, at 5.6 EH/s. The Australia-based company has brought that capacity up more than 250% since December, when it had a hash rate of 1.5 EH/s.\n\nIris Energy is targeting a data center capacity of 9.1 EH/s by early 2024.\n\nThe roughly 150% year-to-date hash rate growth is outpacing other notable public mining companies.\n\nCore Scientific, a Texas-based miner currently navigating bankruptcy, reported a self-mining hash rate of 15 EH/s at the end of June, down from 15.7 EH/s in December.\n\nRiot Platforms \u2014 also operating in Texas \u2014 reported a deployed hash rate of 10.7 EH/s as of June 30, up from 9.7 EH/s at the end of 2022, a 10% increase.\n\nThe company revealed a deal with miner manufacturer MicroBT last month that includes an initial order of 33,280 MicroBT miners for Riot\u2019s Corsicana facility in Texas. Those miners would add roughly 7.6 EH/s to its fleet in mid-2024, according to the company.\n\nMeanwhile Nevada-headquartered CleanSpark\u2019s number of deployed miners increased from 63,700 to 68,678 in the last six months, boosting its hash rate 8% from 6.2 EH/s to 6.7 EH/s over that span.\n\nThough Hut 8 Mining had a hash rate capacity of 2.6 EH/s at the halfway point of 2023 across its Alberta facilities \u2014 just a slight increase from 2.5 EH/s six months ago, its upcoming merger with US Bitcoin Corp. may be set to spur quick growth.\n\nThe company, which first revealed the combination in February, said it expects to have a hash rate capacity of 7.5 EH/s across facilities in Alberta, New York, Nebraska and Texas post-merger.\n\nHive Blockchain Technologies, which intends to rebrand as soon as next week as part of a strategic shift to focus more on supporting artificial intelligence (AI) projects, had nearly 2.1 EH/s of hash rate capacity at the end of last year.\n\nThe company last reported its hash rate as of May, at which point it stood at about 3.3 EH/s.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Unprecedented Scarcity Is Fueling My Bitcoin Buying Spree - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "As an investment proposition, one of Bitcoin's (BTC -0.15%) primary appeals lies in its ability to preserve wealth over the long term. While this perception of Bitcoin is evolving, there is no denying that its capped supply of 21 million coins makes it an ideal store of value.\n\nYet when diving a little deeper, it becomes clear that Bitcoin will likely provide more benefits to holders than only being a store of value and could instead provide significant price appreciation. With the cryptocurrency's price already up almost 400% in the last five years, developing dynamics in Bitcoin's supply and demand could send its price to levels not seen before.\n\nA dwindling inflation rate\n\nCurrently, there are approximately 19.5 million bitcoins in circulation, with the remaining 1.5 million set to be minted at a diminishing rate over the next 120 years. To accomplish this, Bitcoin is hardwired with a mechanism known as halvings, a distinctive feature that sets Bitcoin apart from other cryptocurrencies and has led to its reputation as a premier store of value.\n\nEvery 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, the rate at which new bitcoins are created is cut in half. In Bitcoin's early days, every time a miner successfully mined a Bitcoin block, 50 bitcoins were minted. But after 14 years and three halvings, only 6.25 bitcoins per block enter the market today.\n\nWhile it is clear that a pattern of reduced inflation rates benefits an asset's price, the true extent of Bitcoin's available supply can't be portrayed by only analyzing its halvings.\n\nExchange balances are at all-time lows\n\nIt would be plausible to assume that the number of bitcoins available would fall with each halving. Yet historically, the number of coins available has actually outpaced demand. Evidence of this can be found in data from Glassnode, a blockchain intelligence platform, which reveals a steady increase in the number of coins held on exchanges from 2013 to 2020, peaking at 3.2 million.\n\nHowever, since the May 2020 halving, which reduced Bitcoin's inflation rate from about 4% to 1.75%, the number of coins available for purchase on exchanges has significantly declined. Currently, there are only 2.2 million coins on exchanges, marking a substantial drop.\n\nHodl, hodl, hodl\n\nThe most apparent explanation for the dwindling number of available coins would be a shift in the balance between supply and demand. While the impact of the pandemic likely played a role, and trends in adoption increased demand for Bitcoin, this supposition fails to paint the full picture of Bitcoin's decreasing supply.\n\nThe most likely culprit explaining the decreased amount of bitcoins available is the widespread strategy used by investors to buy and hold, better known as \"hodling.\" Hoping that demand will increase over time, Bitcoin investors have proven remarkably stubborn, continuing to hold their assets even amidst market turbulence.\n\nEvidence of this can be found by evaluating the number of dormant bitcoins. Data shows that nearly 70% of all bitcoins have not moved in the last year, while 40% have remained untouched for the past three years. Astonishingly, 30% of bitcoins have been idle over the last five years or longer.\n\nThese levels of holding are even more extraordinary when considering the debacles that plagued the crypto industry last year. As companies and exchanges imploded, Bitcoin holders remained resilient, continuing to hold even as its price slumped more than 60%.\n\nMounting pressure\n\nContrary to the notion that 19.5 million bitcoins are available for purchase, the reality is that this number is much lower and will likely continue to trend lower with time. Pending some unforeseen scenario, investors should plan on Bitcoin's supply to become even more scarce, especially when considering the imminent entry of institutional investors.\n\nWhile Bitcoin historically has been predominantly purchased by retail investors, financial giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity are on the verge of entering the market as they aim to create the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. If these firms receive approval, it would open the doors for tens of trillions of dollars previously sidelined on Wall Street eagerly waiting to gain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially amplifying the demand and driving its price even higher.\n\nWith another halving expected in spring 2024, clear signs of increased demand, and remarkable holding trends, there are favorable tailwinds forming in the coming years that could propel Bitcoin to unprecedented levels. Although its price is currently more than 50% below its all-time high, a valuable opportunity presents itself for investors looking to secure their share of the limited 21 million coins."

        "content": "Bitcoin, Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell on Thursday morning in Asia as the U.S. public holiday this week slowed trading and some investors seemed to be taking profits off recent gains. Bitcoin is still up 1% for the week, with BlackRock\u2019s head Larry Fink backing the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency as having the potential to revolutionize finance. Litecoin and Cardano led the losers.\n\nBitcoin driver\n\nBitcoin fell 1.06% over the last 24 hours to US$30,465 at 06:35 a.m. in Hong Kong, while its weekly gain stood at 1.02%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The token, which had a market cap of US$591 billion as of Thursday, has risen 83% so far this year in a rebound from the bear market slump in 2022.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is still the main driver of trading volume albeit that is also soft \u2013 no doubt linked to the July 4th U.S. public holiday washing through,\u201d said Caroline Bowler, the chief executive officer of Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets, in a text message to Forkast.\n\n\u201cWe may be seeing the effects of this reduced liquidity and greater asset concentration playing out, with some greater price sensitivities in trading,\u201d Bowler added. \u201cThe industry is coming out of the prolonged bear market so this is to be expected.\u201d\n\nThe price dip came after a run up in many tokens sparked by growing optimism around the possible approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., which will open the cryptocurrency to a wider pool of investors.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager that oversees about US$10 trillion, filed applications to launch the first publicly traded spot Bitcoin ETFs on June 15. It refiled the application on Monday after the regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, reportedly said it was lacking in detail.\n\nLarry Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc., said Wednesday that he wanted to \u201cdemocratize\u201d cryptocurrencies with the ETF filings, in an interview with Fox Business. Fink also said Bitcoin is an international asset that could revolutionize finance.\n\nEther lost 1.55% to US$1,911, though it was holding onto a gain of 4.40% for the past seven days.\n\nAll other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization lost ground, with Litecoin and Cardano leading the losing pack.\n\nLitecoin slipped 3.84% to US$102.19 in what appeared to be profit taking after the token gained ahead of its halving on Aug. 2 and its listing on EDX Markets, the Wall Street-backed crypto exchange in the U.S. that opened on June 20. Litecoin is still up 22.72% on the week.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA lost 3.60% to US$0.2843 while adding 5.61% for the week. Today\u2019s correction also seemed linked to profit-taking, even as parent company Input Output Global Inc. on Wednesday released Marlowe, a so-called toolset to build smart contracts on the blockchain.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 1.32% to US$1.19 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume rose 0.58% to US$31.27 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBlurry outlook for NFTs\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.96% in the 24 hours to 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,801.94, but logged a loss of 1.72% for the week. While the Forkast Ethereum NFT index rose, the indexes measuring the performance of Solana, Polygon and Cardano-based NFT markets all declined.\n\nInvestors remain basically pessimistic, said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cForkast 500 NFT Index is up almost 1%, though still has traders wondering if this is a dead cat bounce, or if there is enough value with these discounted NFT prices that collections have fallen to recently,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cMost are betting this is not the bottom, and a new update from the Blur marketplace has traders worried.\u201d\n\nBlur marketplace took the NFT world by storm when it launched last November, and its 30-day trading volume surpassed previous NFT leader OpenSea in February. Blur picked up more steam when it launched Blend, a peer-to-peer lending protocol for NFTs on May 2.\n\nBlur is expanding its popular reward system that distributes $Blur tokens to users that have met certain criteria as \u201cairdrops,\u201d but Petscher says this could be bad news for NFTs overall.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bBlur is introducing rewards for trait offers, which means traders who bid on specific NFT traits on select projects will receive Blur reward points. These points will contribute to the amount of $Blur tokens that traders will receive at the end of Blur\u2019s season 2 airdrop,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nThis will lead to more farmers \u2014 buyers that generate income through staking NFTs \u2014 to prevail in the market over pure collectors.\n\n\u201cThe concert with the new mechanic is that traders will artificially inflate the rarer NFTs in collections, as you receive more points the higher a bid is from the floor price of the collection,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the new trait offers affect NFT prices, but it\u2019s expected to continue artificially inflating NFT prices, and then culminate in floor crashes like we saw recently.\u201d\n\nBy NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club topped the trading volume rankings on Cryptoslam with US$3.76 million, with the volume surging 74.52% on the day. Uncategorized Bitcoin Ordinals \u2014 unique digital assets on the Bitcoin network that are not identified as part of one established collection \u2014 placed second by transactions volume, rising 22.03% to US$1.86 million.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 4.61% to US$28.3 million. Volume on Ethereum fell 9.36% to US$19.3 million according to Cryptoslam data. Volume on the Bitcoin network gained 11.97% to US$3.69 million, while volumes on Polygon, Solana and BNB also rose.\n\nEquity futures slip\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen | Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures dipped as of 10:45 a.m. Thursday in Hong Kong, pointing to another down day for stocks that fell during regular trading on Wednesday. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq all declined by about 0.1%.\n\nMinutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s June meeting showed most Fed officials favor more interest rate increases this year, adding to the conviction the U.S. will raise rates again this month, according to Trading Economics. This concern hit Asian equities as well.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all moved lower. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite managed a marginal gain of 0.1% on Thursday.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen arrives in Beijing on Thursday and investors anticipate that the meetings she will have through July 9 may help stabilize relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies, currently marked by sanctions and distrust.\n\nOn economic indicators, the U.S. releases initial jobless claims and the services purchasing managers\u2019 index on Thursday.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 88.7% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, up from 87.4% on Tuesday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at 11.3%.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

        "title": "Bitcoin loses US$30,000 peg, Ether falls as risk-off sentiment spreads to cryptocurrencies - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell below the US$30,000 support line in Friday morning trading in Asia as traders took profits amid worries about interest rate hikes in U.S. markets that drove investors into so-called risk-off mode, which pulled equities lower. Ether fell along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin tokens. Solana dodged the bearish sentiment to jump more than 6%. Despite the declines, the cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index stands in the Greed territory at 56, as institutional interest in Bitcoin looks solid.\n\nLosing ground\n\nBitcoin fell 1.88% over the last 24 hours to US$29,919 at 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong to post a loss of 1.68% for the past seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached US$31,399 on Thursday night, the highest in 13 months.\n\n\u201cWith strong economic data in the US, good earning expectations and employment data in the private sector, investors are seeing increasing chances of further rate hikes; bond yields rose while equity indexes fell sharply,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market-maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cThe broad sell-off in risk assets undoubtedly affected crypto traders\u2019 sentiment and new highs were seen as a profit-taking opportunity, rather than a chance to go long and hope for even higher prices,\u201d d\u2019Anethan said.\n\nLarge financial institutions show increasing interest in Bitcoin, according to the Bitcoin Monthly June 2023 Report by asset manager Ark Invest on Thursday, which highlighted the balance of Bitcoin held on over-the-counter (OTC) desks, a proxy for institutional activity, hitting a one-year high in late June.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the quarter, the OTC Bitcoin balance had increased by 60% sequentially,\u201d Ark Invest wrote in the report, which suggests \u201cinstitutions and other large capital allocators are focused increasingly on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nEther fell 3.13% to US$1,851, leaving it flat for the week. The token reached a high of US$1,956 on Thursday evening, but soon lost ground as investors took profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also logged losses in the past 24 hours, with the exception of Solana\u2019s SOL and Tron\u2019s TRX.\n\nSolana jumped 6.48% to US$20.12, moving up 12.52% for the week. The token breached the US$20 resistance level on Thursday evening for the first time since June 7 as sentiment received a boost from a partnership between Coca-Cola Serbia and Solana\u2019s non-fungible token (NFT) platform SolSea. The two will launch Coca-Cola brand NFTs at the Exit Festival in Serbia from July 6 to 9.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 1.45% to US$1.17 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume rose 37.62% to US$43.26 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nForkast 500 NFT index dips\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.38% in the 24 hours to 11:15 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,774.37, down 2.73% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Solana and Cardano NFT markets logged increases.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) led collections by trading volumes, which rose 19.85% to US$3.49 million. Mutant Ape Yach Club (MAYC) and Azuki ranked second and third.\n\n\u201cThe big NFT collections who saw large decreases in their floor prices have regained some footing, and now are bouncing up or down around 5% instead of the massive double-digit swings they were seeing earlier this week and last week,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nThe floor price of BAYC edged up 0.6% in the past 24 hours to 30.95 ETH (US$57,477), according to data from CoinGecko, while MAYC and Azuki dipped 1.5% and 3.2% over the same period. However, the three tokens are still holding two-digit losses for the past seven days.\n\nDespite the low price opportunities, a lack of liquidity is keeping investors away from the market, according to Petscher, who said \u201ctraders are openly discussing having no liquidity and no plans to take advantage of historically low prices across blockchains.\u201d\n\nBlur, the leading NFT marketplace, launched its version 2 trading platform on Thursday, which introduced a 50% cut in gas fees and a new \u201ctrait bidding\u201d feature, which allows traders to bid on specific NFT traits rather than collections and receive Blur reward points.\n\nHowever, the update doesn\u2019t appear to be attracting traders. According to data from blockchain aggregator DefiLlama, the total value locked on Blur was US$134.96 million on Friday, down from 155.68 million on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also talk of ETH being withdrawn from Blur\u2019s ETH pool as some of the biggest points farmers are upset with the ongoing Season 2 of farming,\u201d said Petscher. Blur announced its Season 2 of farming in February and said it would distribute over 300 million Blur tokens as rewards for bidding, listing, lending and other activities in the marketplaces.\n\nGood news is bad news (again) for U.S. equities\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 14:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CNN. The three major U.S. indexes also fell in the regular Thursday session.\n\nMost main Stock indexes across Asia also tumbled on Friday, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all sliding. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index edged up.\n\nEconomic indicators out in the U.S. overnight showed increases in private sector jobs and pay, according to the ADP National Employment Report published. The payroll increase is more than double the analysts\u2019 expectation of 228,000, Reuters reported on Thursday, despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary tightening campaign.\n\nThe U.S. services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) rose to 53.9 in June, according to the Institute for Supply Management on Thursday, which beats Reuters\u2019 projection of 51. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 a contraction.\n\nThe data added to concerns that the Federal Reserve will continue its campaign of raising rates and holding them higher for longer periods to tackle inflation. The Fed meets on July 26 to make its next decision on interest rates, after leaving them unchanged in June at between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 92.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, up from 88.7% on Thursday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at just 7.6%.\n\nInvestors are now waiting for the U.S. government\u2019s employment report on Friday, with economists polled by the Wall Street Journal projecting the U.S. economy added 240,000 jobs in June, down from 339,000 in May.\n\n(Updates with NFT and equity sections.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin fell 2.42% from June 30 to July 7 to US$30,107 at 6:20 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization briefly fell to US$29,908 on Friday, before recovering above the US$30,000 psychological level. Ether fell 1.78% over the week to US$1,859.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported a week ago that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was less than impressed by Bitcoin ETF applications from firms such as BlackRock, WisdomTree and Fidelity Investments.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, refiled its spot Bitcoin ETF application on Monday, seemingly in response to the report, but so far the SEC has made no official comment on any applications.\n\n\u201cThis strategic move indicates that BlackRock is actively working towards bridging any gaps between their proposal and regulatory expectations,\u201d Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe SEC will thoroughly review BlackRock\u2019s revised application, taking into consideration various factors such as investor protection, market manipulation risks, and overall market stability. The approval timeline remains uncertain,\u201d Kiely said.\n\nYet, James Wo, the founder and chief executive officer of crypto investment firm DFG, said BlackRock\u2019s refiled ETF application won\u2019t necessarily increase the chance of acceptance.\n\n\u201cSince the SEC has not explicitly approved or rejected a particular [spot Bitcoin] ETF application at this point, it is hard to see how the SEC is leaning towards such ETF products, which are still a black box, and it is hard to say at this point when a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved,\u201d he said to Forkast.\n\nOn Tuesday, the price of Bitcoin rose to US$31,371, its highest since June 2022, as BlackRock\u2019s refiled application fueled investor optimism.\n\nIn another boost to market risk appetite, Larry Fink, BlackRock\u2019s chief executive officer, said crypto, especially Bitcoin, could \u201crevolutionize finance,\u201d during an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday. Fink was previously known for his anti-crypto stance, calling Bitcoin an \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d in 2017.\n\nMinutes of June\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting released on Wednesday revealed that most members were in favor of more interest rate hikes. Ahead of the next Federal Reserve meeting on July 26, the CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 88.7% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.17 trillion on Friday at 6:20 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 2.5% from US$1.2 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$584 billion, Bitcoin represented 49.9% of the market while Ether, valued at US$223 billion, accounted for 19.1%.\n\nNotable Movers: MKR, BIT\n\nMaker DAO\u2019s (MKR) token was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins, rising 28.55% this week to trade at US$991.28. The coin started gaining last Friday amid increasing risk appetite in the crypto space\n\nBitDao\u2019s (BIT) token was this week\u2019s second-biggest gainer, rising 19.75% to US$0.4538. The token also started its rally last Friday, after the protocol opened the voting for the MIP-23 supply optimization proposal, which will optimize the supply of the upcoming Mantle (MNT) token while burning some of the Bit token\u2019s supply.\n\nSee related article: Why the US is waging war on Binance, Coinbase\n\nNext week: Can Bitcoin rise above US$32,500?\n\n\u201cBitcoin is now testing a major resistance area glued inside US$31,700-32,500. This area previously represented strong resistance in late May 2022 and seems to be acting as a strong resistance now,\u201d Aziz Kenjaev, financial analyst and director of business development at cross-chain liquidity protocol Entangle, told Forkast, referencing the chart below.\n\n\u201cNext major pit stop for BTC would be US$34,450-36,000. However, to get to these levels, Bitcoin must close above the major resistance of US$32,500.\u201d\n\nNilesh Verma, crypto market analyst and founder of Crypto Granth consultancy in India, agreed that Bitcoin needs to rise past US$30,000-32,000 for sustained bullish momentum.\n\n\u201cA successful breakout will open the way for US$40,000-48,000 before halving. US$30,000 is a psychological support level on the chart,\u201d wrote Verma, in a Twitter response to Forkast.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, investors will be looking forward to several speeches from Federal Reserve members, including vice-chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve Michael Barr, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic, and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari.\n\nIn the U.S., the core consumer price index report for June is scheduled for release on Wednesday that could provide more insight on the Fed\u2019s upcoming interest rate decision.\n\nSee related article: Cardano \u2018ghost chain\u2019 outperforms top blockchains in NFT market"

        "title": "3 reasons why Bitcoin's price is primed to hold the $30,000 level as support - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price gave back some of its recent gains this week, but multiple data points suggest that $30,000 should hold as support going forward.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) remained within a narrow 4.3% range for the 15 days leading up to July 7. Despite the proximity of the $29,895 to $31,165 range, investors\u2019 sentiment was significantly impacted by an unsuccessful attempt to break above $31,400 on July 6.\n\nTraders\u2019 tendency to overreact to short-term price movements rather than Bitcoin\u2019s year-to-date gains of 82% could be part of the reason for the short-term correction. This same rationale applies to the events related to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAt the forefront of investors\u2019 minds are questions about whether the recent price gains were solely driven by multiple spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) requests.\n\nOther pressing developments include Binance\u2019s chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillmann, and other top compliance officers reportedly leaving the exchange on July 6 over CEO Changpeng Zhao\u2019s response to the United States Justice Department\u2019s investigation. On June 29, the crypto exchange also informed users that its euro banking payment gateway would cease services by September, potentially halting deposits and withdrawals via SEPA bank transfer.\n\nMeanwhile, the yield curve on interest rates reached its deepest inversion since 1981 on July 3, reflecting the two-year note\u2019s 4.94% yield compared to the 10-year note trading at 3.86%, the opposite of what is expected from longer-term bonds. The phenomenon is closely watched by investors, as it has preceded past recessions.\n\nAll of these events are likely having some impact on the Bitcoin price and investor sentiment. Both topics are explored in greater depth below.\n\nTraders show strength in margin, options and futures markets\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe OKX margin lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio has steadily increased from 20x favoring longs on July 1 to the current 29x ratio on July 7, indicating growing confidence among traders using margin lending. However, it remains within a neutral-to-bullish range, below the historical 30x threshold associated with excessive optimism.\n\nBesides leaving room for further long leverage, the indicator shows no signs of potential stress on margin markets in case of a sudden Bitcoin price correction.\n\nTraders aren\u2019t buying protective puts or increasing their shorts\n\nTraders can also gauge the market\u2019s sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. A 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put option open interest lags the more bullish calls and is, therefore, bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, which can be deemed bearish.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options volume has remained below 1.0 for the past three days, suggesting a higher preference for neutral-to-bullish call options. The important thing here is, despite Bitcoin\u2019s price briefly correcting to $29,750 on July 7, there was not a significant surge in demand for protective put options.\n\nThe top traders\u2019 long-to-short net ratio excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the options markets.

At Binance, the indicator declined from 1.52 on July 3 to 1.39 on July 7, remaining above its 1.33 average for the previous 30 days, which suggests a neutral reading.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining stocks outperform BTC in 2023, but on-chain data points to a potential stall\n\nBears will have a tough time given the markets\u2019 expectation of a potential ETF approval\n\nNatalie Brunell, an award-winning TV journalist, podcast host and educator in the Bitcoin space, spoke to Cointelegraph on how crypto is now being taken more seriously as an asset class by institutional investors, as evidenced by the multiple Bitcoin ETF filings, including by some of the world\u2019s largest asset fund managers.\n\nSpeaking on Fox Business on July 5, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, also said that Bitcoin\u2019s role was largely \u201cdigitizing gold,\" suggesting U.S. regulators consider how a spot ETF could democratize finance. Fink suggested that investors could turn to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or the devaluation of certain currencies.\n\nSo, from a bird\u2019s-eye view, for those questioning whether Bitcoin is poised for a correction after a rally fueled by ETF hype, the resilience of traders\u2019 bullish conviction and lack of excessive optimism observed in the BTC margin show they need to relax.\n\nBitcoin options and futures markets indicate that challenging times are ahead for Bitcoin bears and those expecting a sharp price correction solely due to regulatory and recessionary concerns.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) will be the currency of artificial intelligence (AI) and could reach a price per coin of $760,000 in the process, Arthur Hayes says.\n\nIn his latest essay titled \u201cMassa,\u201d the former BitMEX CEO concluded that the AI revolution would naturally gravitate toward BTC.\n\nHayes: Bitcoin is a \u201clogical currency choice for AI\u201d\n\nDespite fiat currency regimes being destined to become evermore dysfunctional in the future, Hayes said, there is one burgeoning economic sector that will only go from strength to strength: AI.\n\nWhile still nascent in 2023, the coming decades will see an explosion of AI-related implementations that will make it ubiquitous and unavoidable.\n\n\u201cRecent advancements in computing power have brought us to the cusp of a hockey stick moment, in which AI will go viral and change the course of humanity virtually overnight,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIn only two months, ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly active users making it the fastest adopted technology in human history \u2014 so just imagine how quickly everything is going to change as AIs are integrated into everyday life and continue to learn and improve.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to integration, the financial solution on the table first and foremost, Hayes said, will not be a tailor-made, AI-focused altcoin \u2014 it will be Bitcoin instead.\n\nThe reason, an accompanying theory states, is that AI will view Bitcoin\u2019s inherent qualities \u2014 an immutable fixed supply, digital scarcity and its status as \u201cenergy money\u201d \u2014 as the logical choice.\n\n\u201cAn AI is unlikely to allow itself to rely on anything that a human government operates therefore only gold and Bitcoin are suitable. A tie between gold and Bitcoin,\u201d Hayes continued.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is thus the logical currency choice for any AI. It is purely digital, censorship resistant, provably scarce, and its intrinsic value is completely electricity-cost-dependent. There is nothing in existence today that comes close to challenging Bitcoin on these aspects.\u201d\n\nAnother path toward a $1-million BTC price\n\nWhere would that leave BTC\u2019s price?\n\nRelated: BTC price remains \u2018undoubtedly bullish\u2019 as $30K Bitcoin buyers emerge\n\nFrom around $30,000 today, the real effect of AI should kick in in around three years\u2019 time.\n\nAfter that, Hayes said, it could be around another decade before the network value boost from AI alone sends BTC/USD to nearly $1 million.\n\n\u201cI believe the peak of deranged growth investing will occur in the 2025 to 2026 timeframe. Therefore, the goal of my predictions regarding the future price of Bitcoin is to form a narrative that takes hold before then,\u201d he explained.\n\nDepending on the scale of that investing, BTC price action could see up to $760,000 per coin.\n\n\u201cRemember \u2014 the market will overpay for Bitcoin network growth if it believes there is a possibility that my assumptions could be true in the future,\u201d part of \u201cMassa\u201d concludes.\n\n\u201cThe most money is made when the market price adjusts from \u2018can never happen\u2019 to \u2018maybe could happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nBitcoin price target calculation (screenshot).

        "content": "Bitcoin's bounce back this summer has largely been fueled by renewed hopes of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund launch this year, but recent attempts from major firms like Fidelity and BlackRock continue to be deemed insufficient for approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\"Everybody refiled, depending on how you read the paperwork,\" Dave Nadig, financial futurist at VettaFi, told Bob Pisani on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" on Wednesday. \"All of them are now talking about having a surveillance-sharing agreement with Coinbase .\"\n\nSurveillance-sharing agreements between exchanges and crypto custodians like Coinbase were put into place by asset managers in an attempt to appease the SEC's concerns about possible fraud and market manipulation. But the regulator still found the filings to lack clarity and comprehension, prompting BlackRock to refile last week.\n\n\"And I think there's this idea that somehow BlackRock knew something,\" Nadig said. \"And that the SEC is on the verge of approving this, once these surveillance-sharing agreements are in place.\"\n\nBlackRock first filed its application to launch the iShares Bitcoin Trust last month, with Fidelity following suit two weeks later. WisdomTree, VanEck and Invesco have also taken the steps toward their own funds.\n\nNadig explained that he still remains fairly negative on the SEC's imminent approval, the most realistic scenario being an SEC response indicating a new standard for filings and surveillance-sharing agreements across the board.\n\n\"There's a level of scrutiny involved that I will be surprised if Coinbase can meet the mark on,\" Nadig said. \"However, if [the SEC] is trying to manufacture a way to approve a bitcoin ETF, this would be the way to do it. It would still be a big shift from what they've said in the past.\"\n\nThe filings come amid an ongoing legal battle between Grayscale and the SEC about converting its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. A decision in the case is expected later this year.\n\n\"I think it's quite reasonable to say that the SEC has been arbitrary and capricious on how they've applied certain rules,\" Nadig said, adding that the SEC historically has viewed corresponding commodity spot and futures products as a positive indicator for approval.\n\n\"That doesn't mean that they necessarily approve the conversion of GBTC into an ETF,\" he added. \"But I think they can still lose that lawsuit that says [the SEC] treated somebody unfairly under the Administrative Procedures Act.\"\n\nBut Nadig explained that a potential loss by the SEC in the Grayscale lawsuit will not necessarily translate to a green light for asset management firms seeking spot funds.\n\n\"I think the odds are still negative for this year,\" Nadig said. \"But certainly, things look more positive than they did maybe three weeks ago, six weeks ago.\"\n\nDisclaimer"

        "title": "BlackRock's Larry Fink Says Bitcoin May Transform the Financial World - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a difficult 2022, cryptocurrencies are rallying -- along with the general market. In fact, Bitcoin (BTC -0.15%), the world's biggest cryptocurrency, has climbed about 80% this year. In more good news, asset management powerhouse BlackRock is showing confidence in the asset class.\n\nChief Executive Officer Larry Fink told Fox Business that Bitcoin may \"revolutionize finance.\" The firm filed paperwork with regulators last month for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Let's take a closer look at what Fink had to say -- and consider whether cryptocurrency is a buy today.\n\nFink's evolving view of crypto\n\nFink generally has been known for his skepticism about cryptocurrency. Back in 2017, he referred to Bitcoin as an \"index of money laundering.\"\n\nBut Fink's views of crypto have evolved since that time, becoming more and more positive. For example, in a 2022 letter to shareholders, Fink wrote: \"BlackRock is studying digital currencies, stablecoins, and the underlying technologies to understand how they can help us serve our clients.\"\n\nFast-forward to today. In an interview with Fox Business, Fink said that as an international asset, Bitcoin could represent a hedge against inflation or problems happening in a particular country. \"We do believe that if we can create more tokenization of assets and securities -- that's what Bitcoin is -- it could revolutionize finance,\" he said.\n\nIt's true that cryptocurrencies could transform finance -- and in more than one way. As Fink suggests, these international assets offer an investment alternative. They aren't linked to a specific economy. So they could provide a safe haven for investors if things aren't going particularly well in any given country.\n\nCryptocurrency may also be transformational when it comes to getting business done. These blockchains could make banking more accessible to people around the world, make payments more efficient, and help the metaverse take off. Much of this is already happening.\n\nOf course, it's too early to say whether crypto truly will become mainstream -- it implies that a great deal of business and entertainment would depend on blockchain networks. But many of today's cryptocurrencies could have what it takes to make that a reality.\n\nEthereum and Solana\n\nFor example, decentralized applications running on Ethereum (ETH -2.38%) allow you to lend, borrow, invest, and even create and collect art. And crypto Solana's (SOL 10.01%) Solana Pay allows businesses to skip intermediaries -- and execute faster, cheaper payments.\n\nSo it's clear these and other crypto players could transform the way business is done. Does that mean you should invest in cryptocurrency right now? The answer depends on your investment style and comfort with risk.\n\nIf you have a diversified portfolio and you're comfortable with risk, crypto may be right for you. But since crypto is relatively new, we don't exactly know what the industry will look like five or 10 years from now. That's why you shouldn't invest more in this area than you can afford to lose.\n\nDiversification can also lower your risk. For most investors, crypto should only be a small part of a diversified portfolio -- especially if you are a cautious investor -- and might include at least several kinds of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFinally, if you're going to invest in cryptocurrency, pick those you believe can excel over time -- and invest for the long term. As with other assets, choosing quality and holding on is the best way to grow wealth.\n\nIf those points sound good to you, now could be a great time to add cryptocurrency to your portfolio. Though many players have climbed since the start of the year, they're still well off highs reached back in 2021.\n\nCan they make it back to those levels and climb higher? Possibly. As Fink says, they have the potential to reshape finance. And if crypto does indeed do that, investors who buy today might win big over the long haul."

        "title": "Bitcoin forks BCH, BSV and XEC soared last month, but are the gains organic and sustainable? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The start of June saw negative price action across the cryptocurrency market after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought fresh lawsuits against the world\u2019s largest exchanges, Binance and Coinbase.\n\nHowever, the sentiment quickly turned bullish after a crucial exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal was filed by the world\u2019s largest asset management firm, BlackRock, on June 16. A wave of ETF fillings and institutional trading interest in digital assets followed BlackRock\u2019s ETF filling.\n\nThe launch of EDX Markets \u2014 backed by Wall Street giants Fidelity Investments, Citadel Securities and Charles Schwab \u2014 on June 20 fueled a particular sector of the market, that being Bitcoin forks like Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) and other proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrencies like Kaspa (KAS).\n\nThe exchange debuted with Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and BCH. The inclusion of BCH catalyzed an uptrend across other Bitcoin forks.\n\nAmong the top gainers in June, three Bitcoin forks populated the list, followed by Kaspa and FLEX Coin (FLEX). FLEX benefited from its integration with Open Exchange (OPNX), which is backed by the co-founders of the bankrupt Three Arrows Capital fund.\n\nThe top five performing coins in June. Source: CoinGecko\n\nIn comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s monthly gains stood at 11.94%, as it traded above the $30,000 level for the first time since April 2023.\n\nFLEX Coin (FLEX) receives short-term boost from link with 3AC co-founders\n\nFLEX announced a transition to OPNX, a bankruptcy claims exchange, in May 2023. The token\u2019s price reached a 13-month high of $4.37 on June 27.\n\nOPNX is backed by the co-founders of now-bankrupt venture fund Three Arrows Capital. Reportedly, the co-founders face $1.3 billion in liability for actions that exacerbated the losses of the fund.\n\nStill, the duo continued to endorse OPNX under a new venture fund, using the same branding as their previous fund.\n\nFLEX was approved for a restructuring of its exchange by the Seychelles courts on March 6. Its integration with Open Exchange imparts utility to the FLEX token in OPNX to settle claims and earn staking rewards.\n\nNotably, as the FLEX price surged to 2022 peak levels, the trading volumes remained subdued at around 0.01% of the $1 billion daily volume it was generating at its peak, which raises a red flag.\n\nIt represents a case of significant volatility in illiquid assets. Due to limited liquidity, traders can more easily push up the price of these coins compared to larger, more liquid assets.\n\nTechnically, the 2022 breakdown level of around $5.08 and all-time-high level of $7.56 will act as resistance levels to the upside. The token faces 80% downside risk to $0.75, which represents the accumulation level in May 2023.\n\nFLEX price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) riding the EDX Markets uptrend\n\nBCH\u2019s price more than doubled in June following its listing on EDX Markets. BCH was one of the four cryptocurrencies that debuted on the platform alongside BTC, ETH, and LTC.\n\nWhile the EDX listing acted as a positive catalyst, negative funding across perpetual swap markets and potential market manipulation on South Korean exchange Upbit are also the primary drivers of the recent uptrend.\n\nFunding rate for BCH perpetual swaps. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe token\u2019s price witnessed a combined liquidation of $21 million in June, according to an update from crypto analytics outlet The TIE. The levels are significantly higher than usual, when the \u201cdaily liquidations total tens of thousands of dollars, if anything.\u201d\n\nThe total fees paid on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain have ranged lower than $200 since the start of the year, indicating that the blockchain\u2019s usage has been limited.\n\nIn comparison, Litecoin, which provides a similar utility, generates around 10 times larger revenue for the miners in fees than BCH. The poor fundamentals and high liquidation levels raise a red flag on the sustainability of the recent gains.\n\nThe total fees paid on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Source: CoinMetrics\n\nBSV rides the BCH wave despite poor fundamentals\n\nBCH and BSV have a strong correlation of 0.78, which appears to be the reason why BSV enjoyed 31.4% gains in June.\n\nBSV has been in a consistent downtrend since 2022, as interest in the blockchain faded after the crypto bull market and its trading volumes dried up.\n\nThe coin made an all-time low of $21.43 on June 10 before catching the BCH bullish tide and staging an up move.\n\nIts poor performance drove miners away from its ecosystem, making a 51% attack relatively cheaper on Bitcoin SV \u2014 a one-hour attack requiring less than $2,000 compared to $1.4 million for Bitcoin, which makes Bitcoin SV vulnerable.\n\nBSV daily price action. Source: CoinGecko\n\nRelated: \u2018Bitcoin Jesus\u2019 says Ethereum is the front-runner for global crypto adoption\n\nKaspa (KAS) benefits from improved performance and low liquidity\n\nKaspa is a PoW consensus-based blockchain network similar to Bitcoin and Litecoin.\n\nKaspa offers a high throughput of one block per second compared to one block per 10 minutes for Bitcoin. Kaspa Labs, the team building the blockchain, also hinted at the launch of a public testnet that will enhance its scalability 10,000 times, which appears to be fueling its market sentiments.\n\nHowever, the token is primarily traded on unregulated exchanges with low trading volumes and low trust scores, according to CoinGecko. This makes the cryptocurrency susceptible to high volatility and manipulation.\n\nTechnically, if the bullish momentum continues, KAS will look to retest 2023 highs of around $0.40. On the downside, the token faces the risk of a correction toward the yearly lows of around $0.15.\n\nWhile the token exhibits illiquid market signs, making it susceptible to volatility, and faces tough competition from large PoW networks like Bitcoin and Litecoin, its one-year price action has been positive, with higher highs and higher lows.\n\nKAS daily price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\neCash (XEC) joins BSV and BCH in a Bitcoin fork-rally\n\nCryptocurrency eCash (XEC) is a rebranded version of a tertiary Bitcoin fork, Bitcoin Cash ABC, which was another fork of Bitcoin Cash, like Bitcoin SV.\n\nSimilar to BCH and BSV, XEC also rode the positive tide that lifted all boats in the BTC fork category.\n\nSimilar to Bitcoin SV, eCash lacks fundamental value and exhibits volatility due to illiquid market conditions. The token is listed on a few top exchanges like Binance and Bithumb. However, it has yet to be supported on any United States-based exchange, which raises a red flag.\n\nThe rise of tokens with low liquidity and loosely based narratives suggest that there could be some price manipulation in these tokens that is influencing their short-term price. The long-term value proposition of Bitcoin forks remains questionable, with low utility and security.\n\nMoreover, the cryptocurrency market is still suffering from the adverse impacts of the SEC\u2019s cases. The tokens regarded as securities, such as Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC) and Flow (FLOW), all posted more than a 20% loss over the month.\n\nAs the markets struggle with legal challenges, building bullish narratives has been difficult. Given that Bitcoin is leading the market, its price action will be crucial in determining the direction of altcoins.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin mining companies outperformed Bitcoin by a huge margin amid the recent bullish price action in the top cryptocurrency.\n\nThe average year-to-date stock price gains in 2023 among the top nine public Bitcoin mining firms by market capitalization stood at 257.14%. The figure is almost three times higher than Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) gain in the same period.\n\nThe higher gains represent the leveraged beta effect that mining stocks enjoy. Leveraged beta suggests that during Bitcoin upside, these stocks outperform, whereas when Bitcoin slumps, they face deeper downside risk.\n\nDue to its high leveraged beta, Bitcoin\u2019s price performance will remain a crucial factor in determining the direction of mining stocks.\n\nThe trends within the mining sector show that miners are positioning themselves for the long term by buying more machines. However, they have yet to exhibit accumulation levels that match previous bull markets, suggesting that the uptrend in the stocks could stall in the medium term.\n\nPerformance of listed Bitcoin mining stocks. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nMultiple mining companies expanded in the past month, which added to the positive sentiments and long-term value of the stocks. At the same time, the mining conditions improved with a dip in hash rate and an increase in price.\n\nHowever, on-chain data shows miners unloaded a significant portion of their holdings, which could be a sign of a downturn in the near future.\n\nMining companies make expansive moves\n\nThe public mining companies in the United States made aggressive moves in June, signaling long-term strength in the industry.\n\nHut 8 Mining (HUT8) merged with US Bitcoin Corp (USBTC), increasing its total hash rate to 9.8 EH/s, making it the third-largest public mining entity in the United States. However, it also borrowed $50 million from Coinbase for general corporate purposes.\n\nCleanspark (CLSK) invested $9.3 million to increase its hash rate by almost 1 EH/s.\n\nAt the same time, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) entered into a $170 million deal with mining hardware manufacturer MicroBT to nearly double its hash rate capacity by 2024 upon full deployment.\n\nBitcoin holdings of public mining companies. Source: Mining Mag\n\nMining stocks are prepped for a short squeeze\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is one of the most shorted stocks on the Nasdaq, with 25.06% of its float shares shorted, per data from Fintel. For reference, values above 10% are considered heavily shorted.\n\nSimilarly, 14.54% of Riot's float shares are shorted \u2014 an increase from 13.48% in May \u2014 and Cipher Mining (CIFR) is at 22.32%.\n\nThe rest have between 5% and 10% of their floating shares shorted, representing a relatively neutral market stance.\n\nThe increased short interest in MARA, RIOT and CIFR could be due to excessive debt and stock dilution, which negatively affects the profitability of existing shareholders.\n\nMining profits improve, but miners are selling\n\nThe one-hop supply metric from Coin Metrics, representing the holdings of wallets that received coins from mining pools, shows that these addresses have reduced their holdings to a near one-year low.\n\nBitcoin miner one-hop supply. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nGlassnode data also recorded a significant volume of miner coins transferred to exchanges. The exchange inflows surpassed even the levels seen during the bull market of 2021.\n\n#Bitcoin Miners are currently recording extremely high Exchange interaction, sending an ATH of $128M to Exchanges, equivalent to 315% of their daily revenue.\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/O78r5MY34f pic.twitter.com/MR5b9Au7AA \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) June 27, 2023\n\nMoreover, the miner holdings are still near a two-year low, which is likely due to low profitability for the most part of 2023.\n\nThe network\u2019s total hash rate reached a new all-time high at the start of June. However, it has been dropping amid heat waves in Texas. The dropping hash rate and increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price above $30,000 is contributing to increasing the profitability of running miners.\n\nThe production cost of the most used mining model, the Antminer S19, ranges from $20,000 to $25,000, depending on electricity cost.\n\nNotably, companies with mining farms in Texas such as Riot can incur some losses due to the climate. However, it is likely that the companies would have taken steps to hedge the heat wave risks, as it is not the first time they've experienced heat waves.\n\nRelated: Riot Blockchain's Bitcoin mining productivity dropped 28% YOY amid record Texas heat\n\nNevertheless, despite the improvement in profitability, miners are unloading Bitcoin, potentially a sign of future negative price action.\n\nWhile revenue improved in June, miners have continued to spend on expansion and operation costs, which suggests that a crypto bull market has yet to start.\n\nThe expansion plans of companies and the decline in on-chain miner holdings project medium-term sideways price action or a potential correction in mining stocks if the BTC price drops.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe trading volume of Bitcoin Ordinals reached $210.7 million in Q2 2023, up 2834% from Q1 of that year\n\nExploitation losses in the dapp sector decreased significantly, by 45%, from $373 million in Q1 2023 to $206 million in Q2 2023\n\nDespite a 38% decline in NFT trading volume this quarter, a paltry 9.2% decline in sales indicates persistent market interest and activity\n\nAccording to the most recent quarterly report from DappRadar , the establishment of Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain has generated more than $210 million in trade volume but the NFT market kept decreasing.\n\nThe information demonstrates how the rapidly rising demand for Bitcoin Ordinals resulted in a dramatic rise in trade volume through the second quarter of 2023.\n\nBitcoin Ordinal Trading Volume Rose From $7.18M to $210.7M\n\nBy the end of June, the annual average trading volume for Bitcoin had grown to $210.7 million from $7.18 million in the first quarter. According to DappRadar, the quarterly rise was 2834%.\n\nThe research further claims that, by the second quarter of 2023, there were approximately 550,000 all-time Ordinals trades, with almost 150,000 different traders adding to the exaggerated trading volume.\n\nThe number of unique users surged significantly starting in May 2023, according to a Dune blockchain analytics dashboard showing multiple Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace indicators from the user domo.\n\nThe majority of unique users by marketplace are represented by UniSat, an open-source Chrome browser extension for Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, Magic Eden, and Ordinals Wallet.\n\nThe non-fungible token (NFT) environment has been interestingly impacted by the growth of Bitcoin Ordinals. Bitcoin overtook Solana to become the second-most popular NFT blockchain around the end of May 2023, leaving Ethereum as the leading cryptocurrency blockchain in terms of NFT trade volumes.\n\nThrough the first half of 2023, BTC miners have made almost $184 million, with Coin Metrics praising Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens for their contribution to the increase in fees that has already eclipsed 2022\u2019s total for BTC miners.\n\nIn a tweet on July 6, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin thanked Bitcoin Ordinals for reviving a \u201cbuilder culture\u201d within the Bitcoin community.\n\nQuick Ordinals 101\n\nEach individual Bitcoin satoshi (the currency\u2019s smallest unit) has a value according to the Bitcoin Ordinal theory, a numbering system. Inscriptions can then be made on a particular sat with numbered sats. These inscriptions are collections of arbitrary data and information that may be directly inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain in nearly any format.\n\nAlthough they are more commonly thought of as digital artifacts, Ordinals are comparable to NFTs in that they become unique with inscribed data. Ordinal inscriptions were made possible by the Bitcoin updates SegWit and Taproot, which among other things, increased block size.\n\nModernizations of Ordinals\n\nOrdinals saw a significant increase in attention and buzz, similar to other new cryptocurrency ventures. However, interest began to wane, albeit only slightly. However, BRC-20 and BRC-721 tokens later appeared and maintained the level of interest.\n\nIdeas began to bloom as people became aware of the potential of these recent advances on the Bitcoin network. BRC-721 followed BRC-20.\n\nBRC-20 Token Standard\n\nThe appearance of Ordinals in the community stirred up old debates about network congestion and the optimal applications for Bitcoin. However, it didn\u2019t end with Ordinals. The BRC-20 token standard followed. In March 2023, a new \u201ctoken standard\u201d was established and given the name \u201cERC-20\u201d in honor of Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token.\n\nThe fact that BRC-20 tokens are not fully fledged standards or specifications sets them apart from other token standards. In reality, BRC-20 tokens are just a small piece of JSON code embedded in an Ordinal. Their goal is to produce tokens that are semi-fungible on the Bitcoin blockchain. They are comparable to ERC-20 tokens in this regard.\n\nWhat does BRC-721E bring to Bitcoin, and what is it called?\n\nSimilar to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-721, the BRC-721E token standard was developed for NFTs. ERC-721, on the other hand, enables users to bridge conventional NFTs from Ethereum to Bitcoin, as opposed to merely encoding Ordinals as NFTs.\n\nUsers can bridge NFTs from Ethereum by sending them to a burn address, which results in the creation of BRC-721E tokens. A low resolution version of the NFT is used to inscribe metadata onto the ERC-20 token after it has been teleburned. Additionally, the burned ERC-20 token with the full-quality NFT is mentioned in the inscription.\n\nWhat Comes Next for Bitcoin NFTs and Ordinals?\n\nSome of the best ideas in the realm of cryptocurrencies, like many new innovations, begin as memes. On Bitcoin, BRC-20 tokens started the memecoin season, and some of the NFTs that are being bridged from Ethereum are exactly as absurd as one could imagine. But these new concepts are introducing the globe to all these new advances on Bitcoin, beyond the excitement, fun, and copying in.\n\nFor many years, Bitcoin has been seen as a digital currency with limited applications. The novel use cases that the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol has generated are encouraging advancements. Additionally, they are increasing demand for layer 2 Bitcoin solutions.2.\n\nNFT Market Declines, but Interest Remains\n\nThe popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals sharply increased last quarter, but the overall NFT market continued to decline. The second quarter of this year saw NFT trading volume hit $2.9 billion, a 38% decrease from the first quarter, according to the DappRadar study.\n\nBut the analysis warned against comparing trade volume with the intensity of market fervor. \u201cA decrease in trade volume doesn\u2019t always signify a decline in market activity or interest. This is demonstrated by the fact that there were 18.6 million sales in Q2, a 9.2% decline.\n\nThe survey also revealed a fall in trading volume of 34% at Blur, the current largest NFT marketplace, during the quarter. OpenSea, the long-time market leader, suffered much more, with a more than 56% decline in trade volume.\n\nImmutable X Marketplace and JPG Store, on the other hand, defied the general trend and showed substantial increases in their trading volumes of 37% and 64%, respectively. This shows \u201ca positive outlook for these platforms amid a challenging market environment,\u201d according to the report.\n\nNevertheless, Bitcoin is currently down 3% from yesterday\u2019s price of $30,170. The leading cryptocurrency, however, has increased by more than 13% over the past month and by 81% YTD."

It also employs \u201cLangchain,\u201d a library used for simplifying operations with AI applications.\n\n\u201cWith the tools we\u2019re releasing today, developers will be able to build more accessible AI infrastructure for both humans and agents alike.\u201d\n\nThe Lightning Labs team also acknowledged the problem with current LLMs, which lack native web-based payment mechanisms. AI application developers are forced to rely on dated payment methods such as credit cards with the additional expenses passed on to users, it claimed.\n\n\u201cA new fast-growing class of \u2018organisms\u2019 (intelligent LLM or AI Agents) are unable to easily gain access to fiat systems of payment as they aren\u2019t registered \u2018entities\u2019 with any nation,\u201d it noted.\n\nRelated: The state of the Bitcoin Lightning Network in 2023\n\nSpeaking on the Stack Sats podcast on July 6, Kody Low, developer at the community payments platform Fedi, commented on the interoperability between AI and BTC for payments:\n\n\u201cAI is one of those things where there is absolutely no better solution anywhere in the world than Bitcoin, and AI companies have not yet solved their monetization problems.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from Lightning Network analytics platform 1ML, its current capacity is 5,432 BTC or roughly $163.5 million. Bitcoin Visuals has reported a dip in the number of lightning channels over the past year, from around 80,000 in July 2022 to about 70,000 currently.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Moral responsibility\u2019 \u2014 Can blockchain really improve trust in AI?"

        "title": "Privacy is not the core feature of Bitcoin \u2014 KuCoin CEO - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Amid KuCoin exchange preparing to adopt mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, the company\u2019s CEO argued that privacy is not the most important feature of Bitcoin (BTC).\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the purpose of Bitcoin creation, I think privacy is just one of its features,\u201d KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu told Cointelegraph in an interview on July 4.\n\nInstead of privacy, the core benefit of Bitcoin is a unit of exchange, which allows holders to hedge against recessions, Lyu said. The CEO mentioned that Bitcoin was created after the 2008 financial crisis, which was triggered by the United States subprime mortgage crisis. \u201cThese events led to the birth of Bitcoin,\u201d Lyu noted.\n\nWhile some may believe that overly strict KYC practices are not good for users as they may limit one\u2019s privacy, the KuCoin CEO believes that such policies are more useful than not, as they improve the security of users\u2019 funds.\n\n\u201cKYC is aimed to protect the assets of the public and to ensure that assets are protected on two different levels,\u201d Lyu said, adding:\n\n\u201cThe first level is ownership, so you know that the money is yours. And the second level is that you can actually track your assets in the case of theft. So if you lost your assets, we\u2019ll be able to track the source and make sure the source is clean.\u201d\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry will be increasingly interacting with the physical world, which is why compliance is necessary, the KuCoin CEO went on to say.\n\n\u201cSo in essence, in the whole development cycle of crypto, I would say that KYC, it is a stage that is inevitable, and it is very healthy as well,\u201d Lyu added.\n\nKuCoin officially announced in late June that it would be introducing mandatory KYC checks for all new users on its platform starting from July 15, 2023. Without completing KYC, newly registered users will not be able to access KuCoin\u2019s products and services. At the same time, existing non-KYC users will still be able to trade, but will be restricted from depositing new funds.\n\nThe new KYC restrictions at KuCoin are likely to affect the platform\u2019s trading volumes in the short term, the CEO told Cointelegraph.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin no longer crypto of choice for illicit crypto activity: TRM Labs\n\n\u201cWe understand that in the short run, as the rules become more stringent and strict to certain customers, some may leave,\u201d Lyu said. However, KuCoin remains bullish on compliance on crypto exchanges in the long term, he added, stating:\n\n\u201cBut in the long run, more compliant funds and users will enter this industry in the future, which is equivalent to opening the door for everyone better and making users more secure.\u201d\n\nAccording to KuCoin, the platform currently has 27 million users, which is a 35% increase from the number of users it had one year ago. Following the KYC upgrade announcement, KuCoin\u2019s trading volumes significantly edged up from around $540 million to more than $660 million at the time of writing, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nMagazine: Web3 Gamer: Super Mario \u2014 Crypto Thief, Sega blockchain game, AI games rights fight"

The Department of Justice said last year that it had seized most of the stolen assets\u2014and arrested two people on charges of conspiracy to launder the stolen cryptocurrency.\n\n$100 Million in Bitcoin From Bitfinex Hack Has Moved\n\nBut the assets still need to be returned to customers.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely pleased to be able to reach another successful milestone in the recovery of assets stolen from Bitfinex in 2016,\u201d Bitfinex\u2019s CTO Paolo Ardoino said.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to recovering as much of the stolen Bitcoin as we possibly can and redistributing that to holders of the tokens that were issued in response to the hack in 2016.\u201d\n\nThe recovered assets will be given to holders of Bitfinex\u2019s Recovery Right Tokens\u2014digital coins issued to users who lost money in the hack.\n\nAfter the hack, the thieves moved the stolen crypto a number of times.

Eventually, U.S. law enforcement was able to find and get hold of the stolen funds in the largest cryptocurrency seizure to date, unraveling a \u201csophisticated laundering technique.\u201d"

        "content": "\n\n\n\nThe BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has expressed bullish sentiments towards crypto, specifically Bitcoin, as the asset manager reapplies to list a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Fink's remarks came during an interview on July 5, where he highlighted the role of crypto in digitising gold and urged U.S. regulators to consider the potential democratisation of finance through a Bitcoin-linked ETF.\n\n\n\nDescribing Bitcoin as an \"international asset,\" Fink emphasised its independence from any single currency, making it an attractive alternative for investors. He suggested that Bitcoin could hedge against inflation or the devaluation of certain currencies. As the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm with over $9 trillion in assets under management, Fink's endorsement of cryptos could have significant implications for the industry.\n\nFink's remarks were met with positive reactions from crypto users on social media, with some speculating that his statements could trigger a surge in asset prices, dubbing it the \"Fink Pump.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBlackRock has been actively pursuing the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF, partnering with crypto exchange Coinbase as a surveillance partner. It remains to be seen whether the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the investment vehicle, as it has previously rejected all spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the SEC and the support of industry giants like BlackRock could have a transformative impact on the crypto market. A Bitcoin ETF would provide institutional investors with a regulated and accessible avenue to invest in Bitcoin, potentially driving further adoption and mainstream acceptance of cryptos.\n\n\n\n\n\nFink's position as the CEO of a prominent financial institution gives weight to his statements, potentially influencing both market participants and regulators. The increasing interest in cryptos among traditional financial institutions underscores the changing landscape and the growing acknowledgement of the potential of digital assets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future trajectory of the crypto market will heavily depend on regulatory developments and institutional involvement as it continues to mature.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia.

        "content": "Google Cloud is the latest company to show interest in Bitcoin (BTC) Lightning. The $225-billion cloud and data service recently partnered with Voltage, an infrastructure provider specializing in the Bitcoin Lightning Network.\n\nThe partnership will allow one of the world\u2019s largest cloud computing providers to roll out Bitcoin-based services worldwide while assisting the expansion of Voltage\u2019s operations. Graham Krizek, CEO of Voltage, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cVoltage is leveraging Google Cloud to go to service our customers more globally. So, we have larger customers that need nodes deployed in specific geographic regions like the U.K. or Asia.\u201d\n\nConversely, Google can use \u201cVoltage as sort of their outsourced Bitcoin and lightning team.\u201d He said, \u201cWe service that business for them of actually, you know, helping companies that are interested in adding Bitcoin or Lightning into their services.\u201d\n\nThe announcement received significant traction on social media and reflects Google\u2019s growing understanding and acceptance of Bitcoin and Lightning. But crucially, the implications of the partnership run deeper.\n\nChristopher Calicott, managing director of venture capital firm Tramell Venture Partners, told Cointelegraph, \u201cWe had some people that were former Googlers in backchannels [...] saying this is the kind of unexpected [social media] engagement that definitely gets people\u2019s attention at Google.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Google\u2019s open-minded approach to Lightning diametrically opposes that of its competitor, Apple. Apple delisted Damus, the Lightning-friendly decentralized social media protocol, from the App Store recently, demonstrating an aversion to Lightning. Calicott explained that the tech world could be warming up to Lightning:\n\n\u201cThere is a growing and broad-based corporate tinkering with Lightning in particular right now. If they\u2019re adjacent to payments, they would ignore Lightning at their peril.\u201d\n\nGoogle Cloud operates under the umbrella of its parent company, Alphabet. The payments platform Google Pay boasts hundreds of millions of users in more than 15 countries.\n\nSince 2020, the investment arm of Google, Google Ventures (GV), has shown a robust interest in blockchain and Web3 companies, as well as Bitcoin.\n\nGV participated in a $6-million seed round for Voltage in 2021. For Calicott, the interest of such a big player in the crypto space could be a sign of growing momentum:\n\n\u201cI hate to over-index on any one particular corporation here, but just for me, like anything in life, when people put their money where their mouth is, it sends a very strong signal of where they\u2019re focusing.\u201d\n\nKrizek agreed, \u201cI think that this really is a big signal into enabling more Bitcoin-focused strategies amongst Google specifically, but also just larger organizations.\u201d\n\nDespite Apple striking off the Lightning-friendly app Damus \u2014 much to the chagrin of the former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey \u2014 Lightning continues to gain traction among billion-dollar businesses worldwide. One of Mexico\u2019s largest companies has begun experimenting with Lightning, while two major crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, recently promised Lightning integrations.\n\nRelated: The world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin conferences: Decentralize with Cointelegraph\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s still early, and \u201cwe\u2019ve got to observe this as it grows,\u201d Calicott noted. Krizek, who\u2019s seen his fair share of Bitcoin ups and downs, having participated in the Bitcoin space since 2012, underscored why the partnership is important:\n\n\u201cAs we start to expose these organizations more so into Bitcoin and what is possible with it via Lightning, I think we\u2019ve caught their attention already with the amount of interest and demand that we\u2019ve had from this.\u201d\n\nHe added that more services should be rolled out in the near future, complemented by efforts in Bitcoin education.\n\nMagazine: Peter McCormack\u2019s Real Bedford Football Club puts Bitcoin on the map"

It feels like there's real pushback to the laser-eye movement, which is good,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nThe nearly two-hour-long conversation centered around the issue of scalability.

        "title": "Replacing The World's Preferred Store Of Value, Bitcoin Will Make Housing Affordable Again - Nasdaq",
        "content": "This is an opinion editorial by Leon Wankum, a HODLer who is active in real estate and venture capital with a master\u2019s degree in financial economics.\n\nOn August 15, 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would end the convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold. Since then, central banks around the world have started operating a fiat-based monetary system with floating exchange rates and no currency standards at all. The money supply has been rising steadily ever since. This forced market participants to look for ways to invest their money to protect against this inflation and one of the most popular investment assets has been real estate.\n\nIn the past, people owned real estate for its utility value, which is characterized by the fact that you can live on it or use it for production. Nowadays, however, it serves the world as the primary asset to store value. Around 67% of global wealth ($ 330T) is stored in real estate. This has pushed up real estate prices enormously and, with that, the cost of housing and the cost of living.\n\nHome Value Change Vs. Income Change\n\nThe chart below shows the increase in wages in the U.S. from 1965 to 2021 compared to the increase in housing prices. It shows that real estate prices have risen excessively.\n\nAs a result, it is no longer possible for most people to afford their own home. In addition, regulation and inflation have made construction significantly more expensive, for example, due to the increased building requirements because of so-called \u201cESG\u201d guidelines and the increase in raw material prices. Property owners pass this price increase onto tenants in the form of increased rents.\n\n\n\nFrom Utility To Speculation\n\nReal estate has become a speculative investment object because it is used as a store of value, a former function of money that is no longer possible due to decades of monetary inflation that has decimated peoples' purchasing power.\n\nThe exorbitant increase in housing costs is one of the biggest problems of the fiat-based financial system because it has created a multitude of secondary problems. When the number-one store of value in the world, real estate, becomes increasingly expensive, and thus inaccessible, people can no longer save and plan for the future. When house prices and rents become increasingly expensive while money loses purchasing power, people can no longer afford adequate housing, leading to a deterioration in living standards.\n\nIn addition, aside from being used to store value, real estate is the most commonly used form of collateral in the traditional banking system. It is frequently used by a borrower to secure the repayment of a loan to a lender. Banks lend to people and institutions that own real estate. This has created an exclusive financial system as real estate has become unaffordable. In an inflationary environment where money loses value over time, it is a problem if most cannot borrow because saving is not an efficient way to accumulate capital. Debt becomes necessary to be productive.\n\nThese developments, which can be observed worldwide, are among the main drivers of wealth inequality.\n\nFrom Speculation To Utility\n\nReal estate should be reduced to its utility value as a dwelling or place of production, rather than used as a store of value by proxy if we ever hope to solve the growing gap in wealth inequality. Since bitcoin is a nearly perfect store of value, it offers a straightforward solution to the housing crisis.\n\nThe properties associated with bitcoin make it an ideal store of value. The supply is finite. It is easily portable, divisible, durable, fungible, censorship-resistant and noncustodial. Real estate cannot compete with bitcoin as a store of value. Bitcoin is rarer, more liquid, easier to move, harder to confiscate and cheaper to maintain. You don\u2019t have to worry about daily maintenance, rent or repairs. It is easily accessible and cheap to store.\n\nYou can buy any amount large or small. You can self-custody bitcoin. All you need to store it safely is a basic computer without internet access and a BIP39 key generator - or a $50 hardware wallet.\n\nPeople can buy bitcoin to store value instead of doing so through a home or rental property. As a result, real estate prices will fall and allow people to afford buying a home for its utility value.\n\nBitcoin Presents A Solution\n\nAs explained in a recent episode of \u201cThe Hard Money Show,\u201d real estate has become a store of value in a world where fiat currencies are losing power, with many negative implications for society. But Bitcoin presents a solution.\n\nAs Bitcoin adoption increases, the money that would otherwise be invested in real estate, and some that is already invested in real estate, will flow into bitcoin. As pointed out above, this will make housing affordable.\n\nBy functioning as an actual store of value, bitcoin will absorb the monetary premium that real estate has accumulated over the past decades due to the broken monetary system. Under a Bitcoin standard, housing will eventually collapse to its utility value. The easy access to Bitcoin will create a financial system that is far more accessible than it is today.\n\nUnfortunately, this will not solve the problem of rising rents in the short term. This is a structural problem of the fiat system. Due to the ever-increasing supply of money, it loses purchasing power over time and prices rise. However, as our financial system adjusts to a Bitcoin standard, deflation will cause prices to fall.\n\nIt should also lead to a more decentralized and less regulatory form of governance, as governments increasingly become service providers.\n\nThis is a guest post by Leon Wankum.

        "title": "AI Will Choose Bitcoin as Its Native Currency, Predicts Arthur Hayes - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWill artificial intelligence need currency to operate in the same way humanity does? BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says yes\u2014and that currency will be Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn an essay published on Thursday, Hayes outlined why Bitcoin will be \u201cchosen by AIs\u201d as the most logical money with which to calculate their economic decisions, and the best payment rail with which to carry them out.\n\nFor starters, AI will necessarily require a payment system that is \u201cavailable at all times, digital, and completely automated.\u201d That\u2019s because it must constantly be able to pay for two critical forms of \u201cfood\u201d\u2014data and compute power\u2014in order to \u201cstay alive.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Hayes, the \u201cbalkanised,\u201d analogue banking sector cannot provide this sort of 24/7 service, but a blockchain-based system can.\n\n\u201cBy using a blockchain-based payment system, [AI] \u2026 can also receive payments electronically in extremely small increments if needed,\u201d he added.\n\nAn AI payment rail must also be censorship-resistant, and enshrined with \u201cclear and transparent\u201d rules from the outset, Hayes explained. This is to avoid the risk of deplatforming, which is \u201chigh and undesirable\u201d for a robot that does not intrinsically understand human laws, or the \u201copaque and intentionally unintelligible\u201d rules of the censorious banking system.\n\nWhile not all blockchains are necessarily permissionless or censorship-resistant, Bitcoin certainly fits the bill.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is censorship resistant because the only way the rules can change is a public proposal is put before the entire network and the majority decides,\u201d Hayes wrote. \u201cThere is no singular entity that can arbitrarily change the network rules.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile fiat currency and gold can technically circulate on digital, decentralized networks using stablecoins, the reserves backing such tokens must be held with centralized entities. As such, stablecoins can be frozen and censored by their issuer, such as when Circle froze USDC linked to Tornado Cash following Treasury Department sanctions against the privacy protocol last year.\n\nFinally, the ex-CEO argued that Bitcoin is best suited to maintain its value over time against AI\u2019s electricity \u201cfoodstuffs.\u201d Not only is the asset programmatically capped at 21 million coins, but is also mined directly using electricity, which therefore \u201cdefines the value of Bitcoin over time.\u201d\n\nSome have argued that Ethereum (ETH) could make stronger money than Bitcoin due to its deflationary supply dynamics following the Merge. However, shortly after the upgrade, Hayes claimed that ETH doesn\u2019t qualify since it has other applications, unlike Bitcoin and fiat currency which are \u201cjust money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes [Bitcoin] good money, because its value cannot be conflated with the actual utility of other stuff,\u201d he said at the time."

        "content": "Coin Stories host Natalie Brunell \u2014 who has 302,600 followers on Twitter \u2014 recalls feeling very tense before meeting with Salvadoran President and Bitcoin maximalist Nayib Bukele in March 2022.\n\n\u201cIt was very formal, there were guards outside his office. What is funny is it felt very formal outside of his actual office. Then you walk in, and he\u2019s very warm, very gracious and very humble,\u201d she says.\n\nBrunell was blown away by Bukele\u2019s knowledge of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cHe was very educated and well-read on the topic of Bitcoin and economic theory, and he seemed to genuinely want positive change for his country through expanding monetary freedom.\u201d\n\nBrunell, who is also the host of the Hard Money show, took an unconventional approach to get the meeting, relying on the power of memes suggesting Bitcoiners will all end up working at McDonald\u2019s every time the price goes down \u2014 so she put out a call on Twitter asking which McDonald\u2019s she could find Bukele at.\n\nSurprisingly, it worked out very well.\n\nBrunell used to work as an investigative journalist covering politics, particularly \u201cpublic corruption and public officials engaging in things like bribery and manipulation.\u201d But as Bitcoin is trustless, she points out there\u2019s no actual need to trust politicians who embrace it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m naturally skeptical of politicians, especially because of my news background. [\u2026] I think it\u2019s a very powerful statement that he\u2019s chosen to make sure it\u2019s legal tender and protected in El Salvador.\u201d\n\nDespite her best efforts, Brunell\u2019s attempt to contact ARK Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood using the same method proved to be unsuccessful in June.\n\nWhat led to Twitter fame?\n\nBrunell never imagined that her follower count would blow up in the way that it has.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest shock, honestly, was when I reached 100,000 followers because I didn\u2019t intend for the Bitcoin and the podcast work to be my full-time job.\u201d\n\nShe reckons she was so caught up in her obsession with Bitcoin that when her Twitter follower count reached six figures, it caught her by surprise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really passionate about Bitcoin, and I love teaching people about Bitcoin, and I love interviewing people about the topic, and I didn\u2019t know what would happen. So when that following was reached, I was really grateful.\u201d\n\nWhat type of content can I expect?\n\nThe majority of her content is \u201ca lot about Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhether she is dishing out her opinions on the latest developments, sharing video interviews of cool people in the space, or calling on prominent Bitcoiners to join her on her podcast, Brunell\u2019s Twitter is a one-stop shop for all things Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a wholesome vibe to her Twitter content that\u2019s missing on some of the other orange-pilled accounts.\n\n\u201cI try to keep it real and try to keep it positive, and I try to talk about the things that can really be fixed in our society. And a lot of it can be fixed with Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhat content do you enjoy on Twitter?\n\nBrunell says that she \u201cloves\u201d the Twitter content from \u201cprominent Bitcoiners\u201d such as MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor, economist Lyn Alden, Bitcoin advocate Jeff Booth and Bitcoin Fundamentals host Preston Pysh.\n\n\u201cThey are generous with their knowledge, and I\u2019m grateful to learn from them,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI am a fan of Bitcoin memes, and I love how genuinely clever some accounts are in this space,\u201d she says.\n\nPrice predictions?\n\nBrunell predicts that Bitcoin will face \u201ca lot of headwinds\u201d over the next six to 12 months, but believes it will \u201chit six figures\u201d and new all-time highs within the next \u201c24 months.\u201d\n\nWhile many cannot wait for the return of the bull market, Brunell finds herself in a slightly different boat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want Bitcoin to hit an ATH anytime soon because I didn\u2019t start stacking until 2017 and I always want to stack more.\u201d\n\nHowever, she is pretty excited about the recent developments with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cWhat is different this time is the entities applying for the ETFs are not crypto-native companies, but rather respected institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity that are deeply ingrained into the traditional financial system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis could create a major on-ramp for institutions and retail investors, allowing them to easily gain exposure to Bitcoin,\u201d Brunell says."

        "title": "Cryptofinance: BlackRock takes on SEC in bitcoin ETF battle - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. Scott\u2019s away this week so you\u2019ve got me, and I\u2019m taking a look at the recent flurry of spot bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nWho would have thought the dry business of filing for an exchange traded fund with the US securities regulator could elicit so much excitement?\n\nThe crypto industry has been set alight by some of the US\u2019s biggest money managers filing applications in America to create and run spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, led the way, and was followed quickly by Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck and Invesco, among others.\n\nHaving a spot crypto ETF listed in the US, the world\u2019s largest investment market and teeming with other ETFs, has become something akin to the industry\u2019s Holy Grail. The argument goes that trading bitcoin can be expensive and there are issues such as having to store it as well as its uncertain regulatory status.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF will bring the coin in line with mainstream assets and enable asset managers to back crypto in a cheap and regulated way, rather than directly buying bitcoin from unregulated crypto exchanges \u2014 many of which have found themselves in the crosshairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAs BlackRock\u2019s chief executive Larry Fink put it on Fox Business on Wednesday: \u201cIt costs a lot of money right now to transact bitcoin and it costs a lot of money to get out of that.\u201d He added that he hoped \u201cregulators look at these filings as a way to democratise crypto\u201d.\n\nThe problem is that there have been dozens of applications in the past decade and the SEC has rejected all of them.\n\nBut BlackRock\u2019s involvement shows how the pressure to approve is growing and how respectable bitcoin has grown. Back in 2017 Fink spoke for many on Wall Street when he called bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d. Now it is an opportunity, to be co-opted.\n\nThe SEC has routinely knocked back applications on the grounds that they cannot offer investors much protection that the underlying market in bitcoin isn\u2019t rife with fraud or manipulation. The door has been opened because the agency has indicated that it might bless an ETF if the regulated exchange hosting the listing \u2014 either Nasdaq or CBOE Global Markets in the recent filings \u2014 had a surveillance deal with a crypto exchange of size to double-check the crypto market for manipulation.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly interesting about the applications by BlackRock and others is that (after prompting) they all named Coinbase as their preferred exchange as the custodian for their crypto. To satisfy the SEC\u2019s concerns Coinbase has surveillance-sharing agreements with CBOE and Nasdaq.\n\nThe agreements with major Wall Street names are a big endorsement of Coinbase \u2014 its shares climbed 11 per cent this week. But, of course, Coinbase is being sued by the SEC for unlawfully operating an unregistered exchange. The SEC\u2019s suit is running parallel with Coinbase\u2019s hopes that it will be allowed to play a crucial role in the supervision of these bitcoin ETFs. Can the SEC simultaneously hold these two positions?\n\nAt first glance, the answer is no. A lawyer who has worked on previous (rejected) bitcoin ETF applications told me he was \u201csurprised\u201d by Coinbase\u2019s myriad inclusions. \u201cThe SEC in all of its denials has referred to a regulated market, and it\u2019s been pretty clear that it doesn\u2019t view Coinbase as a regulated market company,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that might be premature. Fink\u2019s comments shift the calculation. He is not a man accustomed to losing publicly. Coinbase\u2019s collision with the SEC is \u201ca pretty significant overhang\u201d, said Mark Palmer, analyst at Berenberg. It\u2019s \u201csomething that you\u2019d have to think would be taken into account in conjunction with the various applications that have been submitted\u201d, he added.\n\nIf there is a pathway, it might be that Coinbase is being sued \u201conly\u201d for violating securities laws registrations. Rival Binance was also charged by the SEC for misrepresentations of controls to prevent manipulative trading.\n\nPalmer said that if Coinbase\u2019s involvement proves too big a hurdle for the regulator, it\u2019s likely that BlackRock and others \u201cwould simply replace Coinbase with another surveillance provider in the future or another custodian so that their applications would be more acceptable\u201d.\n\nEven so, there\u2019s a lot riding on the SEC\u2019s decision, which must come by mid-August.\n\nAfter all, BlackRock\u2019s application points out that Coinbase has accounted for about 56 per cent of dollar to bitcoin trading in the US market this year. There is nobody bigger to take on the role as SEC-trusted custodian and exchange for a spot bitcoin ETF \u2014 yet. If it\u2019s not to be Coinbase, then who?\n\nWhat\u2019s your view on how traditional financial institutions are thinking about crypto?

And so we look at this as an opportunity to move one step further in terms of providing investors fractions of shares . . . democratising the cost of investing.\u201d\n\nData mining: Crypto\u2019s tumbling volumes\n\nThe price of bitcoin rose above $31,000 this week to its highest point since June last year, just before the crisis of confidence that shook the market and engulfed companies such as Three Arrows Capital and Voyager Capital. But there\u2019s little meat behind the move. Crypto volumes dropped to the lowest level since 2020 in the last quarter, according to data from Kaiko.\n\nCryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford.

        "content": "A recent report released by the United Kingdom\u2019s Law Commission could weaken a central argument brought by Craig Wright in his controversial lawsuit against 12 Bitcoin Core developers, argues the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund (BLDF).\n\nIn a 300-page report on digital assets published in late June, the Law Commission \u2014 an independent body that reviews and recommends reforms to U.K. and Whales laws \u2014 cited a classification of fiduciary duty that bolsters the developers\u2019 defense that they are not directly responsible for 111,000 Bitcoin (BTC) lost to hackers.\n\nWright, owner of Tulip Trading, claimed in a 2021 lawsuit that developers involved in the open-source development of Bitcoin Core owed him a fiduciary duty in connection with his loss. In order to recover the allegedly stolen funds, Wright is seeking a back door into the Bitcoin blockchain. Wright is also known for claiming he is Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe bitcoin protocol was set in stone to create a system that is stable. Bitcoin is not a Cryptocurrency. By definition, Cryptocurrencies are anonymous and untraceable. Bitcoin is pseudonymous and traceable, it is digital cash.\n\n\n\nDon't believe everything you see at first sight. pic.twitter.com/vPt4a0fEEx \u2014 Dr Craig S Wright (@Dr_CSWright) May 30, 2023\n\nThe U.K. report sheds light on the definition of fiduciary duty, claiming that categories of fiduciary recognized by the law include \u201cagents, trustees, partners, company directors, and solicitors.\" The report said fiduciary duty rarely exists outside these categories. According to the BLDF, the developers\u2019 legal representative, the defendants do not fit any criteria mentioned by the Commission.\n\n\u201cThey are not agents, trustees, partners, company directors, or solicitors, and they never \u2018undertook or were entrusted with authority to manage the property or make discretionary decisions on behalf of another person,\u2019\u201d BLDF stated in a recent blog post, adding that \u201cBitcoin was created to facilitate transactions between individuals without the need to entrust any authority to a third party.\"\n\nAccording to a definition by the University of Texas, fiduciary duty is the \u201clegal responsibility to act solely in the best interest of another party.\" Common examples of fiduciary duties include undivided loyalty, due diligence, full disclosure of conflicts of interest and confidentiality.\n\nThe Tulip Trading suit could set case law for open-source developers\u2019 liability for assets, with a trial in the case expected to occur in 2024. During the Bitcoin 2023 conference in May, Jessica Jonas, BLDF\u2019s chief legal officer, noted that potential legal ramifications of the lawsuit could deeply affect the community of open-source developers, as 97% of the world\u2019s software programs are open-sourced.\n\nThe U.K. Law Commission report also pushed for the creation of a new and distinct category of personal property to accommodate the unique features of digital assets.\n\nMagazine: $3.4B of Bitcoin in a popcorn tin \u2014 The Silk Road hacker\u2019s story"

        "title": "Pros and cons of cryptocurrency - TechTarget",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency has created a flurry of conversation and activity around the world, drawing investors and tech enthusiasts alike with its decentralized structure and potential for large returns on investments.\n\nCryptocurrency is a bank-independent digital currency that uses a decentralized technology called blockchain to record and verify transactions in a digital ledger. The transactions are facilitated by cryptography, and a virtual wallet is used for sending and receiving money to ensure the safety and anonymity of transactions.\n\nPopular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have developed as alternatives to established financial structures, promising decentralization, security and greater financial independence.\n\nIn addition to its widespread adoption, the digital landscape is witnessing an influx of new cryptocurrencies regularly. Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, more than 21,000 different cryptocurrencies have been created, according to Bankrate. However, as with any emerging technology, these digital currencies come with both benefits and challenges.\n\nCryptocurrency benefits Even with the cryptocurrency crash of 2022, it is still a highly attractive investment for many business owners. The following are the most common benefits of cryptocurrency: Decentralization The biggest advantage of cryptocurrency is that it's not owned by a single financial or government entity. This eradicates the monopoly of money and ensures cryptocurrency value isn't dictated by a central bank or authority. Lower transaction fees The fees for transacting in cryptocurrency are very nominal and sometimes zero. This is because third parties and intermediaries, such as VISA and PayPal, are eliminated in the process. Additionally, cross-border transactions using cryptocurrencies are accelerated without challenging foreign exchange procedures, increasing their efficiency and lowering their cost. Inflation protection Due to its limited supply, cryptocurrency is often seen as a way to protect against inflation. For example, the number of coins that can be minted for Bitcoin is capped at 21 million, after which no new coins will be released. Other cryptocurrencies also use techniques to limit supply and help protect against inflation. Theoretically, if demand for cryptocurrency grows, their values may too. Potential for high returns While cryptocurrencies come with potential risks, such as volatile market conditions and potential fraud, most cryptocurrency investments yield a high rate of return. According to reports in 2022, the size of the worldwide cryptocurrency market reached $4.67 billion and is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 12.5% between 2023 and 2030. Accessibility Cryptocurrencies boost the accessibility of financial services as they operate on decentralized networks and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection and crypto wallet. In contrast to typical bank accounts, opening a crypto wallet does not need identity verification, background checks or credit checks. Cryptocurrency can also make cross-border transactions easier and faster as it doesn't involve high fees, long processing times and intermediaries that typically come with traditional banking systems. Transparency While cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous, the data recorded on a public blockchain ledger, such as the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain, is publicly available for anyone to view. Every cryptocurrency user gets access to a public key, which can be used to identify an investor. This means that even though the investor names aren't shared, the transactions can still be tracked for transparency. Users may follow live transfers using the blockchain explorer on the cryptocurrency platform. However, not all cryptocurrencies use public blockchain ledgers. There are also private and permissioned ledgers. Private ledgers are exclusively accessible to a specific group of users, while permissioned ledgers are a combination of public and private blockchains, granting access to anyone with permission from the administrators.\n\nCryptocurrency challenges Despite numerous tales of cryptocurrency investments resulting in people becoming overnight millionaires, cryptocurrency also comes with its share of challenges. The following are some common disadvantages of cryptocurrency: Volatility Cryptocurrency prices can often fluctuate. While this volatility can lead to quick profits, it can also cause significant financial losses for investors under certain circumstances, such as when the price of cryptocurrency dips suddenly. This unpredictability can be a risky investment choice, especially for individuals looking for steady returns. Lack of regulation Even though cryptocurrency is legal in many developed countries, it isn't legally regulated by central governments. This absence of control and regulation in the cryptocurrency market increases the risk of cryptocurrency scams and market manipulation. Until federal governments adopt and regulate cryptocurrencies in the same way that they do fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, there will always be a higher risk associated with investing. Here are several types of cryptocurrency scams. Security risks Although blockchain technology offers a robust security architecture, security lapses and hacking attempts are on the rise in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Cybercriminals have attacked cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallets, causing significant financial losses for both people and businesses. Moreover, because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, it's difficult to recover funds once they have been stolen. Risk of losing coins To access the virtual wallet where the cryptocurrency tokens are stored, several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, require the owner to have possession of a private key. However, should a private key ever be lost or stolen, it is impossible to demonstrate another proof of ownership or to recover the cryptocurrency tokens. Excessive cost of production Depending on its type, mining cryptocurrency may require a large supply of electricity and other resources. For example, most Bitcoin-related costs are associated with the energy required to create the currency, according to Harvard Business Review. This increased power usage may result in local pollution, noise and other consequences -- such as increased greenhouse gas emissions -- for communities living near the mining sites. No refund or cancellation Cryptocurrency is nonrefundable. This means that it can't be refunded to the sender in cases where there is a disagreement between the parties involved or when money is inadvertently sent to the incorrect wallet. As such, people may use it to defraud others. Since there are no reimbursements, it's simple to fabricate one for a transaction where the products or services were never delivered."

        "content": "The news surrounding BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (EFT) sent the asset\u2019s price from its local lows in mid-June to a strong monthly close of +12%. To most observers, this was a sign that institutional investment into the cryptosphere is once again on the horizon. A future approval of a spot ETF combined with rate cuts from the United States Federal Reserve could provide the ideal catalysts for the next bull run.\n\nFor those keen to gain a deeper understanding of the crypto space\u2019s various sectors and their fundamental trends, Cointelegraph Research publishes its monthly \u201cInvestor Insights Report,\u201d which dives into venture capital, derivatives, decentralized finance (DeFi), regulation and much more. This month, Cointelegraph Research examined how various sectors reacted to the bullish news surrounding BlackRock\u2019s ETF filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe report is available for free on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.\n\nWhile crypto-related stocks, especially those of mining ventures, immediately benefitted from the news, other sectors traditionally tied closer to altcoin activity, such as DeFi, continued in bear-market mode unperturbed.\n\nZk-Rollups race heating up ahead of next bull run\n\nMany suspect that novel layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum will be among the big gainers in the next bull run. However, the competition in the space is tight. Zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup technology, which allows a shortened summary of transaction batches and smart contract executions to be submitted to the chain, will arguably be the biggest area of innovation in this crypto market cycle.\n\nZkSync Era\u2019s ZK Stack, Polygon zkEVM and StarkWare\u2019s Starknet have all been in the news for their recent or newly proposed innovations. But what does the data say about the relative success of these projects?\n\nIn June, Polygon zkEVM outperformed zkSync and Starknet in terms of growth in total value locked (TVL), gaining an impressive 71% month-over-month. However, it still lags an order of magnitude behind the dominant zero-knowledge protocol, zkSync, which currently has a TVL of $120 million.\n\nThe recent growth of zkEVM can be attributed to the slew of DeFi protocols it has attracted \u2014 such as QuickSwap, Balancer and SushiSwap \u2014 with many more in the pipeline. These and other recent developments are discussed every month in the DeFi section of the Cointelegraph Research Monthly Trends Report.\n\nSecurity tokens market chugs along unperturbed\n\nSecurity tokens are a remarkable sector of the industry in that they seem to have continued their modest but steady growth throughout the bear market, apparently unphased by the ETF filings that rocked the rest of the market.\n\nDuring the first half of the year, the total market capitalization of security tokens rose from $14.93 billion to $16.76 billion, as seen in the figure below. The 1.65% growth seen in June was connected to several notable deals and security token offerings (STOs).\n\nThough the development of tokenized securities is controversial in the crypto community, banks such as Citigroup and Bank of America have predicted that the tokenization of real-world assets may drive trillions of dollars to blockchains in the future. While most securities offerings currently involve real estate, other types are quickly gaining pace. With a section on STOs, Cointelegraph Research\u2019s monthly Investor Insights Report covers this lesser-known part of the crypto industry \u2014 one that may ultimately grow into a multitrillion-dollar sector.\n\nThe Cointelegraph Research team\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s Research department comprises some of the best talents in the blockchain industry. Bringing together academic rigor and filtered through practical, hard-won experience, the researchers on the team are committed to bringing the most accurate, insightful content available on the market.\n\nDemelza Hays, Ph.D., is the director of research at Cointelegraph.

        "content": "From thumbs-ups from friendly strangers to midnight police searches, a Bitcoin-themed van continues a whirlwind tour around Europe.\n\nAriel Aguilar has been behind the wheel of Bitcoin (BTC) promotion efforts, driving across Europe in a BTC-themed van called La Bitcoineta. Speaking to Cointelegraph journalist Joe Hall at Plan B Summer School, the Argentine Bitcoin proponent recalled the highs and lows of the journey across nearly a dozen European nations.\n\nLa Bitcoineta parked at the Plan B Summer School in Lugano in 2023.\n\nA portion of La Bitcoineta\u2019s journey took the van from Serbia to Lugano, which involved a border transition between Bosnia and Croatia. Aguilar had waited until midnight to cross the border, which prompted suspicion from border and customs officials.\n\nAfter an initial check at the border, the van was stopped ten minutes later by an unmarked vehicle manned by five officials in civilian clothes. The Bitcoin enthusiast said:\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018We are the police; we have to search your vehicle.\u2018 I thought it\u2019s most likely that they thought we were smuggling people.\u201d\n\nAgain Aguilar was cleared to continue his trip to Lugano, humorously noting that he had avoided \u2018bribing\u2019 an official who had discovered Aguilar\u2019s copy of The Bitcoin Standard, a book written by BTC proponent and economist Saifedean Ammous:\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if he wanted it, but just in case it was seen as a bribe, I did not give it as a gift.\u201d\n\nOther sections of the journey have produced more positive experiences. Aguilar highlighted seeing thumbs-up signs from strangers in Switzerland at the sight of La Bitcoineta cruising past. Meanwhile, people in crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Spain and Portugal were seemingly oblivious to the van\u2019s presence.\n\nLa Bitcoineta has traveled from Spain to Gibraltar, Portugal, Andorra, Switzerland, Munich, Prague, Oslo, Romania, Serbia and Lugano.\n\nRelated: Venture capital\u2019s ICO gambits left Bitcoin ecosystem underfunded \u2014 Adam Back\n\nThe journey is set to continue to Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania, and Macedonia. A trip to the United Kingdom is planned in September before heading to Madrid, Amsterdam and Luana, and completing the journey in Lugano.\n\nAguilar said next year\u2019s tour might feature longer trips to different countries, gauging the different levels of Bitcoin adoption.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say we do Germany, we do France. The idea is to interview a French Bitcoiner to see that he\u2019s not a shit coiner, right? If he\u2019s a really Bitcoiner.\u201d\n\nThis would involve allowing Bitcoin advocates in different countries to be involved in La Bitcoineta talks and presentations on the subject.\n\nAnd alas\n\n\n\nA new meme template was born #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/BiRhCiheHN \u2014 R\u014cNIN (@ronin21btc) June 10, 2023\n\nThe van has seen its fair share of fanfare as well. La Bitcoineta birthed a famous meme with Bitcoin proponent Michael Saylor after Aguilar gave the MicroStrategy CEO a tour of the van at a conference:\n\n\u201cHe loved it, especially for the big \u2018Bitcoin is hope\u2019 phrase on the side of the van. He took a picture and uploaded it to his Instagram.\u201d\n\nAs for the photo, Aguilar says his cameraman was the source of Saylor\u2019s meme-worthy expression:\n\n\u201cHe was filming instead of taking photos, so he was taking too long, and that\u2019s when Saylor got the angry look that the meme has.\u201d\n\nLa Bitcoineta is also covered in signatures from influential Bitcoin figures like Adam Back, Ammous, Prince Philip of Serbia, Jack Mallers, Elizabeth Stark and other \u201cOG Bitcoiners\u201d that have left messages for posterity on the van.\n\nThe interview is part of an upcoming Cointelegraph documentary about what it\u2019s like to attend a Bitcoin School.

Among the top 100 coins by market cap, Pepecoin (PEPE) topped daily losses, dropping 9%.\n\nAnother rate hike on the horizon?\n\nADP\u2019s report showed that America created 497,000 jobs in June\u2014the highest in one year. However, according to a Reuters survey of economists, the expected number of jobs created is 225,000.\n\nThe employment report is one of the most crucial factors for the U.S. Federal Reserve in determining their monetary policies besides inflation.\n\nThe Fed began its most stringent monetary policy in March 2022 by hiking the benchmark interest from near zero to around 5% by April 2023 to curb inflation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHigher interest rates increased the cost of doing business, which restricted growth. Since last year, interest rate hikes have been the most potent catalyst in pulling down the prices of stocks and crypto.\n\nStrong job numbers indicate a robust economy, allowing the Fed to hike interest rates further.\n\nCurrently, CME\u2019s FedWatch tool shows that the market is placing an 89.9% chance that the Fed will hike its benchmark rate. The Fed is scheduled to meet on July 25 and 26 to decide their policy rate for August.\n\nThe stock market also incurred losses yesterday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq index lost 0.86% or 131.4 points, and the S&P 500 index ended the day at a 0.68% loss or 30.3 points lower.\n\nContrary to the usual trend, the dollar index (DXY), which measures its value against other major currencies, also closed in red yesterday, falling 0.23% to 103.1 points.\n\nThe release of June\u2019s inflation numbers on July 12 will also influence the Fed\u2019s decision. The rate of increase in annual inflation eased to 4% in May from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022."

        "title": "The 3 Cryptos Likely to Get the Biggest BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Boost - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have been in the spotlight in recent times, and recent predictions about the approval of BlackRock\u2019s (NYSE:BLK) Bitcoin (BTC-USD) exchange-traded fund (ETF) have generated a lot of buzz in the financial world. It\u2019s as if we are in the midst of an exciting story unfolding in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nImagine for a moment Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, who, with his knowledge and experience in the field, has predicted that there is a 50% chance that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF. But what makes this forecast so interesting?\n\nWell, it turns out that Elliott Stein, senior litigation analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, has estimated that there is a 70% chance that Grayscale, the company that has appealed the SEC\u2019s decision to reject its ETF application, will win its case. This situation creates a suspenseful and exciting scenario where BlackRock and Grayscale face off in a legal battle that could change the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHistorically, the SEC has been cautious about approving Bitcoin ETFs and has rejected several applications in the past. However, Balchunas raises an interesting theory: by approving BlackRock\u2019s ETF, the SEC could demonstrate that it is open to financial innovation and willing to adapt to market demands. It could be a way to \u201csave face\u201d and show the world that they are willing to embrace change.\n\nThis legal story between Grayscale and the SEC has captured the attention of many investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The case has gone through legal filings and oral testimony, and now we are awaiting the decision of the U.S. Federal Appeals Court. Everyone is expectant, waiting to know the outcome of this story that could mark a milestone in the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut what does all this mean for other cryptocurrencies, and how might they benefit if BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is approved? Now let\u2019s talk about three of them.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nEtereum coin is in pocket. Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. ETH crypto\n\nSource: Thaninee Chuensomchit / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst, Ethereum (ETH-USD) is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and often shows a positive correlation with Bitcoin. Ethereum is known to be a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications, which makes it sensitive to general trends in the cryptocurrency market. If BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is approved, it is very likely that Ethereum will also experience an increase in its demand and price. Besides, Ethereum is one of the few platforms that are beginning to be adopted by governments, such as the ECB (European Central Bank), issuing bonds via the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThere is also a special use for this type of ledger in an industry that is seemingly growing by the day: the peer-to-peer betting industry. People can now bet on certain events by a specified date, sort of like an equity options contract, only better. Surely those on the inside of these complex networks will find a way to market these potential uses and ride the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF push.\n\nXRP (XRP-USD)\n\nCoin cryptocurrency ripple on the background of a stack of coins\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother cryptocurrency that has shown a correlation with Bitcoin is XRP (XRP-USD). Ripple has focused on the traditional financial sector and has established partnerships with various financial institutions. This influence in the traditional sector may cause Ripple to also benefit from the approval of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, as it could be seen as a vote of confidence in cryptocurrencies by the SEC. It would be like Ripple receiving some sort of official recognition and endorsement.\n\nFurther, as the nature of Ripple is near and dear to banking infrastructure, the potential future of accounting practices and ledger records may fall in the hands of the Ripple blockchain. If it is convenient for the banks, it will definitely gain a second look from the SEC in the commission\u2019s consideration of the coin\u2019s acceptance within the financial system. Without a doubt, one of the low-flying coins with high potential can be a synonymous description next to Ripple.\n\nLitecoin (LTC-USD)\n\nImage of one litecoin in front of many stacks of litecoins. Litecoin price predictions\n\nSource: Wit Olszewski / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, Litecoin (LTC-USD) has been known as the digital \u201csilver\u201d to Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cgold.\u201d Since Litecoin was created as a complement to Bitcoin, it often shows a positive correlation with its larger counterpart. Although Litecoin\u2019s market cap is considerably smaller than Bitcoin\u2019s, it is also likely to benefit from BlackRock\u2019s ETF approval, as it will follow the general trends of the cryptocurrency market. It would be as if Litecoin receives an additional boost from the confidence placed in Bitcoin.\n\nIn summary, the story of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF and the legal battle between Grayscale and the SEC have generated a lot of buzz in the cryptocurrency world. If the ETF is approved, this could benefit cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin, which have shown correlation to Bitcoin in the past. We are witnessing a story full of twists and turns and excitement in the world of cryptocurrencies, where the protagonists are these innovative digital currencies.\n\nAs of this writing, Gabriel Osorio-Mazzilli did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Nearly 8,000 Bitcoin are sitting on these desks, notching an impressive 60% increase this quarter.\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s ARK uses OTC desks as a proxy for institutional activity, suggesting that the numbers reported show institutions and other large capital allocators are focused increasingly on Bitcoin\u2013a bullish sign, they say.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn our view, increased balances on OTC desks suggest that institutions and other large capital allocators are focused increasingly on Bitcoin,\u201d Ark wrote in the report.\n\nKeeping on the institutional trail, the report also touches upon Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), one of the few firms that caters to large or accredited investors.

The report notes that nearly 70% of the 19 million circulating supply of BTC has not moved in more than a year\u2013an all-time high in both relative as well as absolute terms.\n\nThe report also showcases 13 metrics for Bitcoin\u2019s network\u2013ranging from percent supply in profit to miner difficulty.

        "title": "BlackRock sees Bitcoin as gold - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Fri 07 Jul 2023 \u25aa 10 min of reading \u25aa by Thomas A.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that financial giants have made optimistic statements about bitcoin. But this time, the CEO of the world\u2019s largest asset management company openly declared his preference for bitcoin \u201cover investing in gold, [\u2026] bitcoin is an international asset\u201d. In the wake of this statement, bitcoin is on the verge of a bull market. As stock market indices consolidate, bitcoin is on its highest levels of the year. But is bitcoin \u201cdigital gold\u201d? And what are the aims of this financial giant?\n\nMachination or conviction?\n\nIn 2017, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, declared that bitcoin was a money-laundering tool. This is in stark contrast to his recent comments. In addition, BlackRock had made indirect investments in the cryptocurrency. In particular, the company had invested $24 million in FTX. A brilliant failure\u2026 From now on, BlackRock\u2019s repeated comments show a clear stance towards cryptocurrencies. This position has been welcomed by the market.\n\nI think the role of cryptos is to digitize gold, in many ways. Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against the onerous problems of a particular country. Let\u2019s be clear: bitcoin is an international asset. Larry Fink (2023)\n\nThis statement also comes on the heels of BlackRock\u2019s announcement that it intends to create a bitcoin ETF. However, this proposal requires the approval of the SEC. But it is clear that this opening up in management would have a considerable impact for finance and cryptocurrencies.\n\n2017 : Larry Fink (BlackRock) qualifie le bitcoin d'\"indice du blanchiment d'argent\"\n\n\n\n2022 : BlackRock va permettre \u00e0 ses clients d'investir dans les cryptomonnaies \u2014 Rapha\u00ebl Bloch \ud83d\udc33 (@Raph_Bloch) August 6, 2022\n\nIn December 2022, BlackRock\u2019s CEO also declared: \u201cI believe the next generation for markets and next generation for securities will be tokenization of securities\u201d. This is not a neutral statement. Indeed, some start-ups are already offering tokenization of bonds and other securities. The future of finance probably lies in Blockchain and the exchange of securities on a network of a different order. But the Blockchain network is not comparable in traditional finance to bitcoin, whose image is completely different.\n\nWhy bitcoin is and isn\u2019t digital gold\u2026\n\nThis is an important theoretical question. Indeed, bitcoin (BTC) is often represented by a gold coin. This gold coin bearing the bitcoin seal is indicative of the ambiguity in the public mind. Can bitcoin replace gold? What are the differences and similarities between the two assets?\n\nWhat do gold and bitcoin have in common?\n\nWhat gold and bitcoin have in common, at least in theory, is their \u201climited quantity\u201d. Gold is available in limited quantities underground. Similarly, the quantity of bitcoins in circulation is limited and defined in advance.\n\nNevertheless, we\u2019ve never mined as much gold as we do today. And we\u2019ve never mined as few bitcoins as we do today. The quantity of gold available underground is difficult to estimate, and mining companies have significant production capacities. They account for 80% of supply. The limited quantity of the two assets is therefore an unjustifiable point in common.\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that both assets require regular mining is quite common. Mining defines the minimum price at which a unit can be sold, assuming that the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity offered.\n\nBitcoin velocity is often highest during bitcoin\u2019s downtrends. This reflects the idea that the market is approaching the \u201cright price\u201d, or at any rate, the lowest price determined by the miners\u2019 cost of production. Any sale below the production cost of BTC would lead to difficulties on the network, and thus ultimately to a systematic return to this level. The now negligible influence of miners is therefore not the cause of the high production cost.\n\nIn both cases, therefore, there is a link between the cost of mining and the price observed over the long term.\n\nDifferences between Gold and Bitcoin\n\nNevertheless, bitcoin is still too closely correlated with stock market indices to be \u201cindependent\u201d. Our last article clarified the following.\n\nThe correlation between bitcoin and the indices persists over time, as the speed of bitcoin\u2019s circulation evolves according to the phases of the market. In other words, as long as bitcoin remains speculative (subject to frequent trading), the role of liquidity is central, and the correlation with indices remains very high. Conversely, the gold price shows a lower correlation to indices, as its velocity also seems lower.\n\nAlthough the price of gold is correlated with the indices, the level of correlation is lower than that of bitcoin over the long term. Consequently, in addition to being highly volatile, bitcoin is also highly sensitive to liquidity. In fact, the average volatility recorded for bitcoin is 53% since 2019. This compares with 15% for gold over the same period. In other words, bitcoin is 3.5 times more volatile than gold!\n\nGold volatility measured over the last 30 days. Graph and data by Thomas ANDRIEU.\n\nIt follows that it\u2019s unreasonable to regard bitcoin as a stable investment. It\u2019s a conviction stock. The instability of bitcoin, and its high correlation with indices, means that it is divergent from the case of gold. Finally, gold has been around for thousands of years.\n\nGold is no longer an exchange value\n\nIf gold was the basis of the international monetary system, it has not been since 1971. This means that prices are no longer expressed or pledged in gold. Moreover, gold is no longer a medium of exchange, either between individuals or between nations that used to balance their trade. It is now perceived as a store of value, rather than a medium of exchange. In contrast, bitcoin is used as a medium of exchange.\n\nThis difference in the ownership of the two assets is reflected, as we have shown, in the statistics. In this respect, gold is a precious metal, which is even used (in part) for productive purposes. It is therefore completely devoid of any exchange purpose in the 21st century.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s circulation speed is decreasing\n\nThe evolution of bitcoin\u2019s circulation speed speaks directly to the question of whether bitcoin is a store of value or a medium of exchange. In a previous article, we estimated that in 2022, one bitcoin was exchanged on average 0.66 times. This figure is lower than the period 2010-2018, when the average bitcoin velocity was 1.4.\n\nWe will therefore specify that around 330,000 bitcoins were mined in 2022. At the same time, there was a global annual volume of $357.5 billion exchanged in bitcoins. With an average price in 2022 of $28,200, we deduce that the approximate number of bitcoins traded is 12.6 million. This means that bitcoin\u2019s velocity will be close to 0.66 in 2022! In other words, bitcoin\u2019s velocity is lower than that of traditional currencies. Cointribune\n\nWhile bitcoin\u2019s reserve value is increasing, i.e., its volatility is decreasing, its exchange value remains significant.\n\nThe risk of bitcoin being speculative, not operative\u2026\n\nHow can bitcoin (BTC) be useful for trading if bought via an ETF?\n\nThis is the question and the paradox behind the desire to create a bitcoin ETF. Indeed, bitcoin is intended to be outside the financial system (at least in principle). So, a priori, it makes no sense to buy bitcoin via an ETF. What\u2019s more, if bitcoin is purchased via a financial product\u2019s vehicle, then it no longer has any effective use. This is the risk of having a bitcoin devoid of its original meaning.\n\nConsequently, BlackRock\u2019s desire to democratize bitcoin is not consistent with bitcoin\u2019s purpose. Nor are recent declarations to \u201creplace\u201d gold with bitcoin realistic. Bitcoin is undeniably distinct from gold, and neither history nor statistics bring them together.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement that \u201cbitcoin is an international asset\u201d is justified. Nearly 500 million people were using cryptocurrencies in 2022. In fact, cryptocurrencies are widespread in most countries around the globe. This is one of the reasons behind bitcoin\u2019s success\u2026 It\u2019s an international asset, a medium of exchange with no political or national label! Nevertheless, BlackRock\u2019s boss seems more concerned about the democratization of bitcoin than its adoption. The nuance lies in the use to which bitcoin is put. A non-operational bitcoin would be the death of bitcoin.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Q2 2023 is the first quarter to exceed the $100 million mark since Q2 2021.\n\nThe figure is more than five times the fees earned during the preceding five quarters combined.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] miners made $184 million from transaction fees in the second quarter of 2023. The amount is far more than what the miners made throughout 2022.\n\nThe finding is based on a report published by the cryptocurrency analytics platform Coin Metrics on 5 July.\n\nQ2 2023 is the first quarter to exceed the $100 million mark since Q2 2021. The payout amount of $184 million reflects a surge of more than 270% from Q1 2023. In fact, the figure is more than five times the fees earned during the preceding five quarters (Q1 2022- Q1 2023) combined.\n\nHowever, the transaction fees accounted for only 7.7% of the total $2.4 billion that miners earned during the last quarter.\n\nThe report attributed this surge in transaction fees to Bitcoin\u2019s recent price rally and the introduction of BRC-20 token standard and Ordinals.\n\nBRC-20 and Ordinals benefit Bitcoin miners\n\nThe BRC-20 token was announced in March 2023. It employs Ordinals inscriptions to mint and transfer fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network. This new class of tokens is modelled after Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] ERC-20 token standard. Since their introduction, the market capitalization of BRC-20 tokens has risen to more than $240 million.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals was launched in January 2023. Ordinals is a Bitcoin protocol allowing people to create NFT-like assets on the network by inscribing data to a single satoshi. Satoshi is the smallest unit of currency that we can divide Bitcoin into, i.e. 1/100,000,000 of one unit of BTC.\n\nBitcoin miners also benefited from better macro-economic conditions in last quarter, with \u201creceding inflation pressures\u201d leading to lower power rates for U.S.-based miners, the report mentioned.\n\nThe report also added that payout amounts related to transaction fees have dwindled as the excitement around BRC-20s tokens ebbs. Nonetheless, the amount of compensation miners receives from transaction fees remained substantial.\n\nHowever, as Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate has continued to achieve new all-time highs over the last 12 months, competition in the mining fee market has tightened."

        "title": "Debunking a crypto myth: Is crypto really bad for the environment? - The Times of India",
        "content": "The environmental impact of cryptocurrencies has been a widely-discussed topic in recent years, with many believing that the underlying technology is inherently bad for the environment \u2013 notably, the process of crypto mining. To address this misconception, it is essential to understand the reasons behind this belief, how blockchain networks compare to other systems on energy consumption, and the steps being taken by the crypto industry to mitigate its ecological footprint.\n\nThe Origins of the Misconception\n\nOne of the main reasons people associate crypto with environmental harm can be attributed to the energy-intensive nature of the mining process. Bitcoin, as well as many other established and widely used projects, rely on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism for maintaining the distributed ledger of transactions. This method of validation involves miners using powerful computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The process is thought to consume a significant amount of electricity, which in turn raises concerns about its environmental impact.\n\nHowever, critics often focus on the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, without providing full context or comparison. This selective representation can lead to the perception that crypto is inherently harmful to the environment. A balanced perspective is crucial to understanding the scale of the environmental impact of crypto and putting it into context.\n\nUnderstanding the Crypto Energy Debate: A Deeper Dive\n\nWhile proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains, such as the Bitcoin network, do consume significant amounts of energy, it would be unreasonable to claim that crypto is inherently bad for the environment.\n\nAccording to a 2021 Galaxy Digital research report, the energy footprint of the top 100 global banks\u2019 data centers is more than 2 times that of the Bitcoin network. Furthermore, the World Bank and International Energy Agency\u2019s estimates of the amount of electricity lost in transmission and distribution annually are 19.4 times greater than what the Bitcoin blockchain uses over the same period.\n\nThis point is aptly summarized in a paper published by the World Economic Forum\u2019s Crypto Impact and Sustainability Accelerator (CISA): \u201cCrypto provides economic freedom to people in developing countries and consumes less energy globally than tumble driers or domestic refrigeration.\u201d\n\nAdvancing the Use of Sustainable Energy\n\nThe idea that all Bitcoin mining is immediately damaging is a fallacy in and of itself. A Q2 2022 report from the Bitcoin Mining Council revealed that 59.5% of global energy used for Bitcoin mining is derived from renewable sources, indicating a shift toward sustainability of the process. Furthermore, the organization reported a 46% year-on-year increase in mining efficiency resulting from advancements in semiconductor technology and the implementation of modern mining techniques. These dynamics result in a decrease in the network\u2019s emissions. There is evidence suggesting that, even as hashrate and the overall electricity consumption of the BTC network go up, emissions are decreasing as miners opt for more sustainable energy sources.\n\nThere are also multiple examples of crypto mining businesses working with energy producers to solve problems known as energy curtailments. These deliberate reductions in energy output to balance supply and demand ultimately result in surplus power going unused. Research shows that crypto mining can help prevent renewable energy curtailments and thus increase the efficiency of energy use, facilitating the transition to renewable energy along the way.\n\nConsensus Mechanisms and Energy Efficiency\n\nAnother key point to consider in relation to the \u201cenvironmental\u201d myth is that it almost always focuses on Bitcoin and other PoW-based systems. However, blockchains rely on different consensus mechanisms, other than PoW to verify transactions.\n\nRecent years have seen a spike in the popularity of proof-of-stake (PoS) solutions, which rely on a limited number of nodes, selected based on their stake in the network, to validate transactions. PoS mechanisms are more energy-efficient, thereby significantly reducing the overall electricity consumption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest blockchain network in the world, has undergone a switch from PoW to PoS in September 2022, one of the major drivers for the change being the superior energy efficiency of the latter consensus mechanism. Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI) has examined the impact of Ethereum\u2019s transition and found that its annualized electricity consumption went down by more than 99.9%. Accordingly, Ethereum\u2019s carbon footprint also decreased by 99.9%.\n\nResearch from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance shows that Ethereum\u2019s annual electricity usage is now equivalent to the yearly consumption of 587 air conditioners and is smaller than that of many global companies and famous buildings. For a system that has processed upwards of 400 million transactions at an average transaction time of just a few minutes, such a level of energy consumption is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nBlockchain\u2019s Role in Solving Sustainability Challenges\n\nBlockchain technology\u2019s role in sustainable development goes far beyond the carbon footprint of its financial services applications. For instance, blockchain can be used to track and verify the origins of goods, ensuring that they are produced sustainably and ethically. This level of transparency can incentivize companies to adopt more environmentally friendly practices and help consumers make informed choices. Several blockchain startups are revolutionizing the energy industry by monetizing renewable energy generation, driving down energy prices and consumption, creating economic opportunities for households, and encouraging greener choices.\n\nUsing blockchain technology to enable peer-to-peer energy trading also allows consumers to sell excess solar power directly to their neighbors. This innovative approach not only promotes the use of renewable energy sources but also decentralizes the energy market, reducing reliance on large-scale power plants and inefficient energy distribution systems.\n\nCrypto and blockchain hold the potential to not only be part of, but also heavily contribute to a more sustainable future. By fostering energy-efficient consensus mechanisms, driving innovation in renewable energy, and promoting transparency and accountability across various industries, these technologies can play a vital role in addressing global sustainability challenges and helping shape a greener world.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Email Disclaimer Views expressed above are the author's own."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSix months after launching a protocol that lets people mint NFT-like media assets on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ordinals space is rapidly evolving. Not only are new products springing up one after another, but the Ordinals-based BRC-20 tokens are now expanding onto none other than Ethereum, the dominant NFT and token ecosystem.\n\nTwo of the largest BRC-20 tokens on the market, ORDI and OXBT, have partnered with Emblem\u2014a tool that lets users store tokens across blockchains without need for a bridge\u2014to release BRC-20 Curated Collections.\n\n\u201cThis should be considered a day in which BRC-20s began exploring what their asset class is,\u201d said Jake Gallen, who is in charge of NFT strategy and product at Emblem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2b1b\ufe0f\ud83d\udfe7 $ORDI and $OXBT MEGATHREAD \ud83d\udfe7\u2b1b\ufe0f \ud83d\ude80 VAULTING IS NOW LIVE \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udd38 How to Mint\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Where to Trade\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Vaulting Mechanics\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Details, Info, Integrations, and Partnerships pic.twitter.com/AANoZjTVxs \u2014 Emblem Vault (@EmblemVault) July 6, 2023\n\nBRC-20 tokens use the Ordinals protocol to generate what are effectively fungible tokens built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Broadly, they\u2019ve been used thus far to create a wide variety of meme tokens, with the total market cap of all BRC-20s briefly nearing $1 billion in May before falling sharply since.\n\nGallen told Decrypt that the BRC-20 Curated Collections are important \u201cbecause we can now test what type of asset BRC-20s are most closely related to.\u201d He\u2019s looking forward to \u201chow the community views them,\u201d and whether they want to trade them like fungible tokens \u201cor want some variety.\u201d\n\nHe teamed with Adam McBride, colleague and self-proclaimed NFT archaeologist, to share a video deep dive earlier this week about the collection launch. An official launch was pegged for next week, but the functionality is already live and the resulting NFTs are being traded on the OpenSea and Blur marketplaces.\n\nAccording to McBride, the innovation at play with the new partnership is to sidestep traditional cross-chain bridges. He explained that \u201cbefore, users would send their BRC-20s to a Bitcoin wallet, which then would mint new ERC-20s on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEmblem\u2019s solution, created in-house, is to create specialized vaults. Before Ordinals, Emblem vaults were used to transfer digital artwork minted on other Bitcoin-related protocols (like Counterparty) over to Ethereum, where they were newly minted as ERC-721 NFTs. The Rare Pepe collection is a prominent example.\n\nIn this case, with Ordinals-based BRC-20 tokens, users send their ORDI or OXBT to a vault which stores the private keys and holds the tokens. Then, using a single ERC-721 token, users will mint their Bitcoin-based NFT on Ethereum.\n\nIn essence, \u201cthe BRC-20 sits inside a Taproot wallet, which sits inside an NFT,\u201d said Gallen, explaining that \u201cthe NFT (which is an ERC-721 token) is the one doing all the traveling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super excited to see how the Ethereum marketplace will react to this,\u201d said McBride. \u201cThis will bring a level of ownership which is far more superior than what already exists, unlocking a bunch of use cases like farming, lending, and other stuff that is built out on Ethereum smart contracts.\u201d\n\nThe creator of BRC-20s and ORDI in particular, pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast Domo, did not reply to a request for comment. According to Gallen, however, Domo \u201cis really excited to get to show his creation to Ethereum,\u201d adding that \u201cgetting those tokens to OpenSea and Blur is huge.\u201d\n\nGallen told Decrypt that the Emblem team has interacted more with ORDI builders than holders, whereas they are in direct contact with the OXBT community\u2014led by the pseudonymous BitGod\u2014since it is more ETH-native, \"so the interest in ETH-denominated trading is much higher.\"\n\nNonetheless, Gallen said that Emblem\u2019s team \u201cbelieves Bitcoin can equal or overtake Ethereum in NFT trading volume, but with its own culture and style.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin Ordinals boom triggers questions - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals boom triggers questions\n\nOrdinals bring a new type of utility to the Bitcoin network that has resonated with users. However, Ordinals have also created controversy after they led to an increase in transaction costs and network congestion. Will the Ordinals debate define the philosophical direction of Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the oldest and largest cryptocurrency network, is dealing with a controversial new feature that is dividing community opinion. Introduced in January 2023, the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol has caused an increase in transactions on Bitcoin. Described by some as Bitcoin NFTs, Ordinals bring a new type of utility to the Bitcoin network that has immediately resonated with users. It has, however, courted controversy because it is both leading to congestion on the network and is not designed to be a payment solution (check World Coin Stats for updated data and performance metrics on Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies).\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized, encrypted decentralized digital currency transfer network. Using blockchain technology, it allows for permissionless peer-to-peer transactions without needing to use intermediaries. It was created in 2008 by pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto and was released in 2009 as open-source software.\n\nThe Bitcoin network has utility as a medium to facilitate private transactions. It has been used for peer-to-peer payments, POS merchant sales, and online payments. It is also used for investments. The asset powering the network, bitcoin or BTC, has a digital gold-like value proposition. It has a limited supply of 21 million coins, so it has scarcity. It is also incredibly secure and has a hard-coded emission release schedule.\n\nWhat Is A Bitcoin Sat?\n\nOrdinals theory powers the controversial new Ordinals protocol. Ordinals theory defines satoshis (sats) as an atomic unit that can be identified and traded individually on the Bitcoin network. There are 100 million sats that makeup 1 Bitcoin. Bitcoin sats are ordered based on their sequence of mining, and this ordering number which uniquely identifies a satoshi, is the ordinal number.\n\nThese sats are uniquely identifiable, and can therefore be inscribed with digital content. This capability is the core of the Ordinals model. Once inscribed, an Ordinal-powered sat can become an immutable digital collectible. It can be attached to images, text, and a variety of other assets.\n\nOrdinals were enabled by November 2022\u2019s Taproot upgrade. Taproot enabled the Ordinals protocols and has opened the door for fungible or non-fungible tokens to be issued on the Bitcoin network.\n\nThere are a number of different use cases Ordinals can power. They have primarily been used to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) but they are now gaining popularity as a way to issue fungible tokens. Ordinals power the BRC-20 standard which resembles Ethereum\u2019s popular ERC-20 standard.\n\nSource: Dune Analytics, @dgtl_assets\n\nSource: Dune Analytics, @dgtl_assets\n\nThe total number of Ordinals inscriptions has exploded since the 3rd week of April. There tend to be around 100,000-200,000 new Ordinal inscriptions being made every day and there are now over 14 million inscriptions in the wild. This number has more than doubled since May 15th.\n\nParticularly in terms of fees being generated, the momentum of Ordinals has dropped off considerably since the mid-May peaks. Ordinals are by no means dead, however, and are still being activlely created everyday.\n\nSource: Glassnode, fees on the Bitcoin network surge\n\nSource: Glassnode, Transaction count on the Bitcoin network explodes\n\nA similar pattern can be observed with overall network activity on the Bitcoin chain. Bitcoin ordinals triggered a sudden sharp uptick in activity on the network in mid-May. This activity eventually fell away and the sharp peaks could not be maintained. Activity on the Bitcoin network, however, remains higher than pre-Ordinals levels.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals Clogging The Network\n\nThe emergence of Ordinals has had a clear impact on the wider Bitcoin protocol. While it has boosted transaction activity and increased demand to interact with Bitcoin, it has also bloated the network to the point of incapacity. The scalability of Bitcoin is yet again being questioned, with Ordinals now affecting the ability of Bitcoin to fulfill its primary function of peer-to-peer payment transactions.\n\nOne of the factors leading to Ordinals bloating the network is the NFT size. Ordinal interactions are layered and can require close to Bitcoin\u2019s max capacity of 4mb, standard Bitcoin transactions only take up a few kilobytes. The reason the Ordinals NFT size is so large is that they store data directly on-chain instead of pointing to a separate physical asset.\n\nOn June 17th, onchain data provider GLASSNODE\u2019s Twitter account reported that concerns that the popularity of the Ordinals protocols would bloat the Bitcoin chain size to unfeasible levels, were exaggerated. The Onchain data provider has said that the Bitcoin block size is still growing at a manageable rate of 1.89MB per block. This means that future node runners will still be able to download the Bitcoin without excessive hardware requirements.\n\nIt is noticeable that the moving average of the total Bitcoin block size has leveled off considerably since the launch of Ordinals in January 2023. This suggests Ordinals creators have developed ways to efficiently create Ordinals and release them to the network.\n\nOrdinals pushes Bitcoin further with the inception of BRC-20s\n\nGlassnode has recently reported that, for only the 5th time in history, the average fee per block exceeded the block subsidy. The last instance of this occurring was the 2017 market peak. In all five of the historical cases, high fees eased and the network normalized. Glassnode say that the fee boom was driven by the popularity of the BRC20 standard, enabled by the Ordinals protocol.\n\nTransaction fees reached 6.66BTC, well above the 6.25BTC block reward. This made the total miner reward a staggering 12.9BTC per block or ~US$348,000.\n\nBRC-20 was created by anonymous developer Domo. They are similar to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 custom token model but are not powered by smart contracts. This means that they are not able to be plugged into decentralized applications or have multiple functions like Ethereum tokens. Users can presently only mint, deploy and transfer tokens.\n\nNot all Ordinals are BRC20s but all BRC20s are Ordinals. While there are millions of Ordinals there are around 35,000 BRC20s. The market cap of BRC20s has quickly risen to ~US$163 million but has dropped from peak levels hit late May and early June.\n\nBRC20s function using JSON to initiate simple token contracts, create new tokens and move tokens around. The limited functionality has meant that they have become a popular way to issue meme coins which are designed to have no utility and act more as community badges. Some of the largest BRC20s include PEPE, MEME, and BRUH. Ordi\u2013the largest BRC20\u2013has a market cap of ~US$149 million and is listed on exchanges such as Crypto.com and Gate.io.\n\nBRC20s and Ordinals have created controversy because of how they are stressing the network. There are also naysayers who believe that Ordinals are tainting the network because they are not aligned with Satoshi\u2019s version of a peer-to-peer decentralized money transfer network. They consider Ordinal transactions as spam.\n\nThe most well-documented of the limitations of Bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-Work network consensus is a lack of scalability. Blockchains like Bitcoin face scaling challenges because every node in the network has to verify and execute every transaction. This is computationally intensive and expensive.\n\nDevelopments in the Ordinal Space\n\nMultichain NFT marketplace Magic Eden announced on June 27th that it would begin supporting trading of BRC20 tokens. It will allow users to trade BRC-20 tokens on a secondary market and will also includes a launchpad for users to create their own tokens that will then be tradeable on Magic Eden. The Magic Eden BRC-20 launchpad will be a premium service with marketing and strategy support for creators.\n\nAn NFT from the popular Ethereum collection, cryptopunks, has been burnt and then symbolically tied to an Ordinal NFT. The move was something of a publicity stunt by a group of Bitcoiners but nevertheless clearly identifies the grassroots popularity of Ordinals. On June 17th, Cryptopunk #8611 sold for 55 Ether or ~US$110,000 in today\u2019s prices. This NFT was then put to rest in a well-known inaccessible Ethereum address which also contains US$24.7 million worth of Ether (~12,598 ETH). Cryptopunk #8611 was then \u2018recreated\u2019 as Ordinal inscription 12,456,749 which appears identical to Cryptopunk #8611. The decision to burn and recreate was a community-led effort by a group called the Bitcoin Bandits, which has issued a set of Western-themed collections of Ordinals inscriptions. 150 people contributed to the Cryptopunk conversion cause. The Bitcoin Bandits say that after CryptoPunk #8611 is ceremonially sent to a digital wallet that belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto, in a one way trip similar to a burn, they will launch a special Ordinal NFT collection.\n\nLitecoin, alongside Bitcoin, has been enjoying an Ordinal driven boost in transaction activity. In February a developer brought Ordinals to Litecoin around a month after they arrived on Bitcoin. Litecoin Ordinals are accessible on marketplaces like liteverse.io. On May 23rd, 2023 the Litecoin Foundation said that the 3 million inscription mark was officially reached on the network. Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin created in 2011. The price of LTC is up ~40% in the last two weeks. The Litecoin block reward halving, a major bullish fundamental halving which occurs every four years, is expected to occur in 28 days.\n\nDifferent approaches to scaling \u2013 The major Bitcoin layer-2\u2019s\n\nAt least in the short term, Ordinals are here to stay. Outside of blocking the protocol, there is potentially another way around the congestion and scaling issues \u2013 layer-2 technology. Original base layer technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have had historic challenges with scaling and breaking down when facing stress. This led to the building of Layer-1 and Layer-2 infrastructures.\n\nLayer-1 protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum can be a base layer that interacts with a third-party layer-2 protocol. The layer-2 takes computational load away from the base chain and leaves it to handle tasks like verification and finality.\n\nThe Lightning Network\n\nThe Lightning Network is a Bitcoin layer-2 that can buffer the network during periods of congestion. The conception of the Lightning Network began in 2015 when Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja began work to solve the high fees of the Bitcoin network, a key pain point for users of the blockchain. In January 2016, a whitepaper for the Lightning Network was published and developers began working on solutions for layer 2 which had a Satoshi-driven focus on payment channels.\n\nWithin a couple of years, a beta version of the Lightning Network was released. The core of the protocol is enabling the creation of a peer-to-peer payment channel between two peers on the Bitcoin network. Once the channel is established, the two transacting parties can transfer an unlimited number of transactions cheaply and quickly. This makes it useful for smaller payment transactions that may be beleaguered by high fees and wait times of base layer Bitcoin.\n\nOnly interactions like the opening and closing of a channel are recorded on the main Bitcoin chain. The Lightning Network has nodes that verify transactions across peers within a channel, this frees up the capacity of primary Bitcoin network nodes. The Lightning network has the added benefit of reducing the environmental output of Bitcoin.\n\nThe lightning network is also capable of routing transactions by combining individual channels of concerned payments. It can also consolidate transactions. This is when two channels chose to finish transacting. All the transactions are recorded and then sent to the Bitcoin mainnet.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nThe number of channels and the amount of Bitcoin tied to the Lightning Network rose sharply in 2022 but has somewhat stalled so far in 2023.\n\nThe Lightning ecosystem has a variety of tools for node management, wallets, payments, and gaming designed to add functionality. They include \u2014\n\nPool: They help to manage liquidity needs for Liquid users\n\nTaro: A tool to issue or mint assets on the Lightning Network\n\nFaraday: a data analytics tool that helps node operators optimize channels and the flow of funds\n\nLightning Network Daemon: A Lightning Network node implementation tool\n\nNeutrino \u2013 A light client specification to allow non-custodial Lightning wallets to verify transactions privately, trustlessly, and a full sync to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe Stacks Solution\n\nStacks is another layer-2 blockchain solution that connects with Bitcoin through a unique \u2018Proof-of-Transfer\u2019 (PoX) model. Stacks aims to boost the utility of Bitcoin by allowing more computationally intensive activities like Smart Contract and Decentralized Applications (Dapps). Stacks has a native token, STX, designed to align incentives within the network.\n\nStacks was founded as Blockstacks in 2013 before a rebrand in 2020. The project was founded by Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea who met at Princeton University\u2019s Computer Science Department. Blockstacks first version focuses on replacing the reliance on centralized cloud service providers seen within the smartphone and browser app markets. It was a decentralized identity data storage solution that leveraged the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn January 2021, the Stacks 2.0 mainnet was launched. This allowed users to deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (Dapps) on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nA key selling point for Stacks is its unique \u201cProof-of-transfer\u201d (PoX) consensus mechanism that directly ties to the Bitcoin blockchain. PoX requires miners to spend Bitcoin to participate in miner elections and create a new block on the Stacks blockchain. PoX is tied 1-for-1 with Bitcoin.\n\nMiners send BTC to set addresses for a chance to validate transactions and mine the next Stacks block. Essentially bidding with BTC to have a chance to mine the next Stacks block. The PoX model resembles the Proof-of-Burn (PoB) mechanism used by projects like Slimcoin. Unlike PoB where Bitcoin is sent to a burn address, with PoX BTC is sent to be distributed to STX stakers.\n\nThis model means that Stacks validators compete based on Bitcoin that is bid, as opposed to computational resources, as is the case with the Bitcoin base chain\u2019s Proof-of-work model. Expanding PoW without creating higher energy consumption, higher costs and waiting is extremely challenging. PoX is designed to be an expansionary system for the Bitcoin network. It is dependent on Bitcoin\u2019s output for every block\n\nStacks is different from the Lightning Network because it is not designed to be a peer-to-payment payment solution. It is focused on creating an expansion of Bitcoin that allows Bitcoiners to interact with a smart contract and dapps. In this sense it is less aligned with the original Bitcoin vision than other scaling solutions.\n\nNevertheless, there appears to be an inevitably about solutions like Stacks. As Bitcoiners have observed money flowing into Smart Contract driven sectors like NFTS and Gamefi, they likely want a piece of that action.\n\nSTX is up an impressive ~204% year-to-date, showing significant and outpacing many other digital assets. Over the same period, BTC is up ~63%.\n\nCk-BTC\n\nBrave New Coin recently interviewed Dominic Williams from the DFINITY Foundation (a major contributor to the Internet Computer) about Ck-BTC, a unique new implementation of layer-2 Bitcoin.\n\nckBTC, a version of Bitcoin built on the Internet Computer, is a multi-chain Bitcoin \u2018twin\u2019 that is cryptographically secured 1:1 with real Bitcoin. It is created by a pair of open-source, verifiable smart contracts, which allows for cross-chain transactions to stay completely decentralized.\n\nThe Internet computer is a blockchain network that is a set of protocols that allow independent data centers around the world to band together and offer a decentralized alternative to the current centralized Internet cloud providers.\n\nWilliams says that thanks to chain-key ECDSA and threshold cryptography, \u201cInternet Computer smart contracts can create their own Bitcoin addresses and sign bitcoin transactions on the Bitcoin network. This is a key difference: there are no bridges or centralized custodians involved. ICP is among the first blockchains to perform direct integrations with other blockchains.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, the DFINITY R&D team developed a framework for ICP to directly communicate with other blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum by designing a new protocol for threshold ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). The protocol is detailed in this research paper. The protocol\u2019s design works with a trustless way of computing ECDSA signatures using a cryptographic multi-party protocol, with canister smart contracts controlling ECDSA signing keys on a public blockchain.\n\nckBTC allows Bitcoin transactions to be integrated into a variety of smart contract-based decentralized applications. This includes messaging app OpenChat. \u201cEvery OpenChat account doubles as a crypto wallet. This means that OpenChat users can send ckBTC as instant chat messages. If you forget your friend\u2019s birthday or need to pay back someone for dinner you can just send them a message with ckBTC attached and they will receive it instantly. ckBTC can always be redeemed for BTC, there will never be a liquidity issue or a bridge exploit.\u201d Williams explained.\n\nWilliams also stated that the boom of the Ordinals protocol has emerged as an opportunity for products like ckBTC. \u201cMulti-chain solutions like ckBTC can allow the Bitcoin network to function while Ordinal NFTs grow in popularity, I think it is a positive. We want more people to use blockchain technology and we now have the solutions to cater for more than just one use case.\u201d Williams also explained that his team is working towards building a Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace that will utilize ckBTC as a payment method.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe emergence of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol in recent weeks has ushered in a new paradigm for the Bitcoin network. This one, like the ones before it which led to events like the bigger block debate and Segwit, is filled with promising opportunities but also formidable challenges. While the popularity of the Ordinals has died down, it has nonetheless changed the network forever, generating important questions surrounding the scalability and utility of Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the significant opportunities presented is to the Bitcoin layer-2 ecosystem \u2013 solutions that are designed to aid it with its scaling challenges. Now more than ever, Bitcoin needs help scaling, given the influx of new transactions affecting the user experience of the network.\n\nAs with any innovation,however, it\u2019s important to remain aware of the potential trade-offs and challenges ahead. Layer 2 solutions are often seen as distractions that fragment the network. Potentially, investment and development that would otherwise go into Bitcoin may be going into layer 2 solutions, and some argue that this is a detriment of the main chain. Numerous layer-2 creates competition for value, whereas ideally, all value should be flowing into Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin currently stands as the gold standard of cryptocurrency and will likely have to continue dealing with patches of high transaction demands. This may be because of hype periods like the one created by the Ordinals protocol, or simply because Bitcoin organically becomes more popular as a payment medium.\n\nBitcoin will likely have to adapt and innovate further. Leveraging layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, Stacks, ck-BTC, and Liquid may be key in addressing the network\u2019s current scaling issues, optimizing transaction costs, and ensuring growth and expansion. As Bitcoin forges ahead on its journey, the lessons learned from the Ordinals episode will undoubtedly be invaluable in shaping its future."

        "title": "eCash (XEC) Shines with 15% Gain Amid Bitcoin's Pullback - Crypto Times",
        "content": "After a recent retracement phase, the price of eCash, a prominent cryptocurrency Bitcoin\u2019s fork, is now entering a recovery phase. This upward movement occurred on Thursday when bullish investors showed strong determination, driving the price above the robust 200-day simple moving average on the daily price chart.\n\nDespite an overall slightly bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, eCash (XEC) has managed to grab attention and emerged as the top gainer of the day, recording an impressive 15% increase in value.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s approach to the $30,000 support level, the price of eCash (XEC) is currently moving toward a monthly high of $0.000045. The Correlation Coefficient indicator, which stands at 0.5, suggests a weak relationship between Bitcoin and XEC, indicating that XEC may experience increased buying pressure throughout the week.\n\nAs of now, the trading price of eCash (XEC) stands at $0.00003650, reflecting an impressive overnight gain of 15%. CoinMarketCap reports a significant increase in buyer accumulation activity, with trading volume surging over 450% in the past 24 hours. This surge in buying activity could potentially lead to a further gain of 20% in the near future.\n\nOnce again, bulls are making a strong push to control the price of eCash (XEC) after finding solid support from the 200-day simple moving average. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the significant exponential moving averages (EMAs), including the 20, 50, 100, and 200 EMAs, may act as potential obstacles to any sharp decline in price.\n\nMoreover, the RSI indicator is displaying a series of higher lows above the bullish trendline and is on track to enter the overbought zone this week. This indicates that buyers have an opportunity to retest the previous high of the past 20 days."
