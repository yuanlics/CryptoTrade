        "content": "Big money management firms are growing increasingly confident that the Securities and Exchange Commission will make crypto history in early January by approving the first \"spot\" bitcoin exchange-traded fund, FOX Business has learned.\n\nSources close to these firms say recent guidance from SEC officials is that a green light will likely come by Jan. 10, 2024. This is the final deadline for the SEC to approve or deny an application from the first firm to ask for the SEC\u2019s blessing for a spot bitcoin ETF: Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management in partnership with 21Shares.\n\nAll told, about a dozen companies, including Wall Street asset-management titans like BlackRock and Fidelity, have applied for a spot bitcoin ETF, or one that is valued off the real-time price of the digital asset.\n\nVALKYRIE INVESTMENTS FIRST TO OFFER ETHER FUTURES THROUGH ETF\n\nPeople at these firms believe the SEC could approve several applications at once. An SEC spokesman had no comment.\n\nIf approval does come, as many expect, it will mark a major step toward the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency in the U.S., something that Wall Street\u2019s top cop, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, has been reluctant to endorse until recently when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a ruling that scaled back his authority in regulating crypto.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF would give retail investors greater exposure to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency at less cost than the already approved bitcoin ETF priced off the futures market. Moreover, investors can get exposure to bitcoin and avoid going to an unregulated exchange by purchasing an ETF through highly regulated money management firms while trading occurs on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq stock market.\n\nOne downside for investors includes an unusual demand from the SEC in the way the ETFs are structured. In meetings with the big money management firms, the SEC is insisting that applicants use cash to buy shares of the ETF, and cannot use the underlying asset, which in this case is bitcoin.\n\nRAMASWAMY WOOS PRO-CRYPTO VOTERS, SAYS HE\u2019LL BUILD NEW POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITAL ASSETS\n\nConventional ETFs allow so-called \"in-kind\" transactions \u2013 which means market makers would be allowed to exchange bitcoin for ETF shares. The \"cash create\" route means ETF issuers will have to exchange bitcoin for cash on every transaction \u2013 a longer and more complicated process that requires the issuers themselves to buy the bitcoin, not the broker-dealers.\n\nSecurities lawyers say another disadvantage of cash creation is that investors would be robbed of an important tax advantage; \"in kind\" purchases are not a taxable event, but selling Bitcoin for cash before the ETF purchase would be.\n\nSeveral spot bitcoin ETF applicants such as Grayscale are hesitant to give up the fight for in-kind creations. In a meeting with the SEC on Tuesday, Grayscale told the agency it believes offering both in-kind and cash creations and redemptions are in the best interest of investors because it supports \"a deeper, more robust primary market, resulting in a more efficient ETP market structure.\"\n\nCash creation essentially shifts the burden of trading bitcoin from professional trading firms to the authorized participants (APs) such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs,\" said Dave Weisberger, CoinRoutes co-CEO. \"This means less competition between issuers and performance will be based on which issuer has the better resources and trading strategy.\"\n\nWeisberger says the SEC is insisting on cash redemption over in-kind because the agency doesn\u2019t currently allow broker-dealers such as Robinhood and Fidelity to trade spot bitcoin directly.\n\nIt is not immediately clear why the agency continues to block brokers from trading spot bitcoin, but Weisberger believes it has a lot to do with the political tension around digital assets from members of Congress. One explanation from people meeting with the SEC is that the commission is worried about the use of bitcoin for money laundering, market manipulation and other illegal purposes.\n\nOne former SEC official blames it on Gensler\u2019s general dislike of digital assets, thus he\u2019s looking to put a \"drag\" on the new crypto product. Gensler still has not provided total clarity about bitcoin\u2019s actual status, whether it\u2019s a lightly regulated commodity or a security like a stock or bond that demands the commission\u2019s full regulatory attention. Ditto for the second-most popular crypto, ethereum. In the past, Gensler has said that most other digital coins are considered securities, though while SEC chair he\u2019s remained mum on the matter.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest money manager, BlackRock, with $9 trillion in assets under management, has made receiving SEC approval for its proposed bitcoin ETF a key corporate priority, FOX Business has learned. Larry Fink, BlackRock\u2019s founder and CEO, has referred to bitcoin as \"an international asset\" and a \"store of value\" rivaling the long-held status of gold.\n\nBitcoin, which started the year at just 16,000, has since surged back up over $40,000, spiking 65% in the past 3 months.\n\nBlackRock, which has more than 400 traditional ETFs on the market, has met with the SEC five times regarding its spot bitcoin ETF application, the most recent of which occurred on Tuesday. SEC staffers have held around 24 meetings with various ETF hopefuls, signaling to the industry that the agency is doubling down to get these ETFs to market in the new year.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nOf course, the SEC could deny all the applications, but industry officials are giving it low odds. The reason: In August, the D.C. Court of Appeals vacated the SEC\u2019s denial of crypto asset manager Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its GBTC Trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. The three-judge panel went on to call the SEC\u2019s actions \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n\nThe ruling is seen as a significant precedent that money managers seeking the spot bitcoin ETF will rely on if the SEC rebuffs their applications."

This upgrade will have a significant impact on Layer 2 solutions such as Polygon and Optimism. This is because it will allow these projects to have more access to network power, which will increase throughput and reduce transaction costs.\n\nJPMorgan believes that these upgrades will bring more investors to Ethereum and cause it to regain market share in the crypto sphere.\n\nJPMorgan is not saying that the price of Ethereum will appreciate. The analysts are \"cautious\" about crypto markets in 2024. They see Ethereum as one of the stronger tokens for 2024. While it may not go up in price, they still believe that it will perform better than other tokens, specifically Bitcoin.\n\nTrending: This brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it?\n\nDespite recent hype around spot Bitcoin ETF approvals and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, JPMorgan is still more bullish on ETH. The analysts believe that the spot Bitcoin ETFs are already priced in. Since approval seems imminent, they believe that markets have already priced in the impact this will have on Bitcoin. They cite the recent Bitcoin run-up as evidence for this.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey also think that the upcoming Bitcoin halving is already priced in. They looked at the ratio of Bitcoin's market price to production cost and saw that it decreased after the most recent halving in 2020. They expect a similar move will follow in 2024.\n\nOther topics discussed in the report revolved around their lack of confidence in decentralized finance (DeFi). They have not seen noticeable impacts of DeFi on the current financial system.\n\n\"The biggest applications of blockchain to traditional finance, i.e. overnight repo transactions via smart contracts in blockchain platforms hosted by companies such as Broadridge and JPMorgan, take place outside public blockchains,\" the analysts said.

Coinglass data shows the break-out caused over $33 million in BTC short liquidations in the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, according to analysts, the largest digital asset by market cap could experience increased sell pressure because a super majority of circulating supply is now in profit.\n\n\"As the market rallies, a super-majority of investor coins have returned to being in-profit,\" Coinglass analysts said in the new report.\n\nCoins held 'in-loss'\n\nThe Coinglass analysis pointed to data that showed how the total volume of coins held \"in-loss\" has declined to around 1.9 million bitcoin, with most held by long-term holders who bought near the 2021 highs.\n\nThe data from Coinglass concurs with that from The Block's Data Dashboard which shows that the percentage of bitcoin circulating supply that is in profit is now over 88%.

        "title": "Bitcoin's unexpected uptick to $38K: What's going on? - Richmond Times-Dispatch",
        "content": "Bitcoin has once again taken center stage, surprising many with its recent ascent to around $38,000. This rally has sparked discussions among investors and analysts alike, with many turning to insights from industry experts to demystify this phenomenon.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin's Journey\n\nTo fully appreciate what's going on, it's essential to consider Bitcoin's tumultuous journey over the past few seasons. Looking at a Bitcoin price chart can help you plot the twists and turns in this cryptocurrency\u2019s journey.\n\nIn November 2021, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of nearly $69,000, capturing global attention. This period was also marked by the meteoric rise of crypto millionaires who had amassed significant wealth through early investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Simultaneously, the NFT market was booming, further fueling the cryptocurrency hype. These developments painted a picture of a rapidly expanding digital economy with Bitcoin at its helm.\n\nThe Decline and Influencing Factors\n\nHowever, this peak was short-lived, as the cryptocurrency experienced a sharp 64% decline the following year. The causes of this decline were multifaceted, influenced by various crypto industry scandals and a series of bankruptcies. Most notable was the Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX scandal, which shook the crypto world to its core.\n\nThe fallout from this scandal was profound, contributing significantly to the 'crypto winter' of 2022, a period marked by plummeting prices and waning investor confidence. However, 2023 has marked a remarkable turnaround, with Bitcoin's value more than doubling, a trend that stands in stark contrast to the previous years' downturn. According to various well-respected publications like The Wall Street Journal, Binance, and CNN Money, this resurgence can be attributed to several factors, including renewed investor interest and confidence in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nTurnaround and Influence of Potential ETF Approval\n\nThe potential approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also played a major role in Bitcoin's uptick. As Michael Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., mentioned in his interview with Bloomberg TV, a Bitcoin ETF could be a game-changer for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nNovogratz predicts that Bitcoin could reach its previous all-time highs within a year, spurred by the excitement and legitimacy that an ETF would bring to the market. The approval of a Bitcoin ETF is expected to open the floodgates for institutional investors, who have been largely cautious about entering the cryptocurrency market due to regulatory uncertainties. Novogratz notes an ETF would provide a regulated and relatively safer investment vehicle, making it easier for these institutional players to invest in Bitcoin. This could lead to a substantial influx of new capital into the market, further driving up Bitcoin's price.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Investor Psychology\n\nThe dramatic swings in Bitcoin's value can often be traced back to collective investor emotions\u2014optimism, fear, speculation, and reaction to global events. For instance, the initial surge in Bitcoin's price was fueled by a sense of excitement and the allure of being part of a groundbreaking financial revolution. Similarly, its subsequent declines often mirrored widespread investor anxiety over regulatory changes or negative news within the crypto space.\n\nAs regulatory bodies like the SEC start to provide more clarity, and if the SEC approves the first U.S. spot bitcoin ETF, the risk perception may lessen among a broader investor base. This shift can lead to more mainstream adoption and an increase in optimism could be a key driver behind the recent price surge.\n\n\"Prices are set on the margin, so that's all new money,\" Novogratz explained to Bloomberg, highlighting the potential shift in investor psychology that could happen if the government greenlights Bitcoin purchases through regulated avenues. This will be particularly impactful in 2024, given the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming election year.\n\nTechnological Advancements and Industry Trends\n\nBeyond regulatory changes and market psychology, technological advancements in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domains also play a critical role in Bitcoin's resurgence. These innovations are not only enhancing the functionality and security of Bitcoin transactions but are also broadening its use cases.\n\nFor instance, blockchain has significantly improved scalability, speed, and security. These enhancements have made Bitcoin transactions faster and more efficient, attracting more users and investors to the platform. Moreover, the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract capabilities has brought renewed attention to Bitcoin's potential beyond just a digital currency.\n\nInstitutional interest in Bitcoin has been steadily growing, too. More companies are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a reserve asset, viewing it as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. This trend is not only a vote of confidence in Bitcoin's value proposition but also brings significant capital into the Bitcoin market, contributing to its price appreciation.\n\nFor those keen on monitoring Bitcoin's latest trends and price movements, a comprehensive Bitcoin price chart is available, providing real-time data and insights. Will the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies through vehicles like ETFs become a reality? How will the global economic and political climate influence the crypto market? The world is watching as the industry continues to evolve.\n\nInformation is intended for educational purposes only and is not to be used as investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin Will Go on Bull Run in 2024, Saylor Says - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nObviously, there has been so much anticipation and frankly, a lot built in, I think, to the price of Bitcoin of this idea that spot ETFs are finally going to come. What's the next catalyst for Bitcoin if and when that happens, How much further can it be pushed upward? Well, I think you can't really underestimate the significance of the spot ETFs. It's not unreasonable to suggest that this may be the biggest development on Wall Street in 30 years. I mean, the last thing that was this consequential was the creation of the S & P index and the ability to invest in all 500 S & P companies via one trade at the same time. So this is very eagerly anticipated. But most of the money in and the Bitcoin market right now is is the hodlers and their traditional crypto investors, mainstream investors, mainstream retail mainstream institutions have not had a high bandwidth compliant channel to invest in this asset class until they spot ETFs. So I think in January the approval of the spot ETFs is going to be a major catalyst that's going to definitely drive the demand shock and then that will be followed in April with a supply shock because there are about 900 Bitcoin a day available for sale by natural sellers, the miners, and that number is going to be cut to 450 Bitcoin a day in April. So it's a it's a pretty big deal. And that puts Bitcoin where a year from now. Higher. There's. You know, we could probably keep a bunch of economists and modelers working all day long to calculate the supply, demand and price elasticity of this. I don't think we've ever seen, you know, a 2 to 10 ax increase in demand combined with having and supply in a scarce, desirable asset that people want to hold for a long period of time. So I think we're expecting 2024 is going to be a major bull run for the asset class. We just don't know how far the assets are going to run at this point. Well, And to get to MicroStrategy specifically, as I said, obviously big holder of Bitcoin, given what you just told me about how a spot ETF is going to make it perhaps easier, more appetizing for retail investors, institutional to to get crypto exposure via that product, Why would someone still need to be a buyer of MicroStrategy? Is this actually something that is going to end up working against you? You know, the ETFs are unlevered and they charge a fee. MicroStrategy is an operating company, so we're fairly unique because we can generate additional Bitcoin via our operations, either via PNL operations or capital markets operations. And we can take advantage of intelligent leverage, like we can borrow money at 0% interest for many, many years. And we did that with the convert and then we can use it to buy bitcoin. So you can really think of the ETFs as like shipping lines, very efficient, long haul, carry a lot of a lot of capital. MicroStrategy is more like an airline. We don't have the cargo capacity and our capital structure that a a container ship has, but we can go faster and we have higher performance. So we provide your leverage and we don't charge a fee. And so if you can dig in to our capital structure, you get comfortable with that. We offer sort of a high performance vehicle for people that are Bitcoin long investors. Well, if it is ultimately for people who want to be long Bitcoin and we are seeing Bitcoin as you anticipate, continually be pushed upward by some of these developments in 2024, what does that mean for your plans around around holding and whether there are entry points at which you would want to buy more? Perhaps not. Well, we will absolutely continue to acquire Bitcoin. Our strategy is to acquire and hold the Bitcoin and we will acquire it by a variety of different means as as long as they're accretive to our shareholders. Our goal is always to find a way to pursue more Bitcoin per share for our shareholders. And sometimes we do with debt, sometimes we'll do it with equity, sometimes we'll deal with cash flows from the business. And of course the volatility in the market just creates more opportunities for us as an operating company. And and our particular business strategy allows us to harvest that volatility to the benefit of our shareholders. Well, and let's talk about how you account for that as well, because obviously last week the Financial Accounting Standards Board passed new rules that will apply to MicroStrategy, essentially means you get to capture all the highs and the lows of your cryptocurrency holdings. Technically, that doesn't actually go into effect until 2025, but you could adopt it earlier. When is MicroStrategy planning to do that? Well, we're still evaluating that. And and I leave that decision to our finance people. But what I'll say about the accounting is I think fair value accounting is is a giant step forward for the industry. And up until now, corporations have had to invest all of their spare Treasury reserves and sovereign debt. Sovereign debt normally has a compound annual growth rate of a few percent. The cost of capital for most companies is 10 to 12%. Bitcoin's got a compound annual growth rate of 40 plus percent over the past four years and even higher than in the more distant past. So having a digital money like Bitcoin as a Treasury Reserve asset allows you to beat the cost of capital and it turns your balance sheet into an asset instead of a liability. So we think this is a real game changer for corporations. So do you think then, that it could be advantageous for MicroStrategy to potentially use these accounting practices earlier rather than later? I think that we'll wait for our finance people to give us that recommendation. I do think that the fair value accounting guidelines from Pfizer are just going to be good for the industry in general. They'll provide more transparency and they'll be good for Bitcoin as an asset class and and for Bitcoin as a Treasury Reserve asset for companies that have large cash flows that they want to carry forward."

        "content": "MicroStockHub / iStock.com\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s disastrous landscape for the crypto ecosystem \u2014 a year marred by scandals, collapses, losses and lawsuits \u2014 2023 fared better. While the industry is still reeling from these developments, some assets have been slowly gaining ground.\n\nLost Money on Crypto in 2023? This Trick Could Help You Pay 0% Capital Gains Tax\n\nFind: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n\nIn turn, many experts argue that 2024 is off to a good start, with some cryptos poised to significantly progress. As of Dec. 20, the global cryptocurrency market cap was $1.72 trillion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $44,130\n\nPast year: up 160.9%\n\nYear-to-date: up 166.46%\n\nPast 30 days: up 17.8%\n\nAll-time high: $68,789.63 on Nov. 10, 2021\n\nMany experts are very bullish on Bitcoin for 2024 due to a combination of factors that could provide a perfect storm situation for the asset.\n\nAs David Waugh, lead analyst at Coinbits, explained, one significant development is the expected approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in January- which could result- according to analysts from Galaxy Research- in $14.4 billion of institutional inflows into Bitcoin in the first year, exerting significant upward pressure on its price.\n\nAnother factor is that by the end of this year, Congress could also pass comprehensive crypto legislation providing the industry with much-needed regulatory clarity, making Bitcoin more attractive to banks \u2013 allowing banks to work with Bitcoin companies to enhance the services they can offer consumers, he said.\n\nFinally, another key catalyst is the Bitcoin halving event slated for April, which occurs once every four years and has always been associated with a massive price increase in the months before and after the event, according to Ric Edelman, founder, Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.\n\n\u201cThe impact of these developments on bitcoin\u2019s price are expected to be substantial, with many predicting future bitcoin prices of $100,000 to $1.5 million,\u201d said Edelman. \u201cI\u2019m expecting Bitcoin\u2019s price to reach $150,000 by Dec 2025.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $2,255\n\nPast year: up 84.7%\n\nYear-to-date: up 87.9%\n\nPast 30 days: up 10.3%\n\nAll-time high: $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021\n\nEther underperformed Bitcoin in 2023 with a gain of \u201conly\u201d 80%, trading roughly in line with its peer group in the smart contract platforms crypto sector, said Zach Pandl, Grayscale\u2018s managing director of research.\n\nPandl added that there has been extensive debate about Ethereum\u2019s competitive landscape as 2023 comes to a close, and he expects this to continue into 2024.\n\n\u201cGrayscale Research remains optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s outlook despite better performance from some other Smart Contract Platform tokens in 2023 (such as SOL or AVAX), as Ethereum network will go through an upgrade in the first quarter, that could support is \u201cmodular\u201d scaling plan,\u201d he said. Another driver could be any progress on the regulatory approval on spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. market, which could support token valuation, as well, he added.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $0.621\n\nPast year: up 78.2%\n\nYear-to-date: up 84.25%\n\nPast 30 days: 0.00%\n\nAll-time high: Jan. 4, 2018, at $3.84\n\nAs Aaron Rafferty\u2019s CEO of StandardDAO and co-founder of BattlePACs, while XRP has increased significantly, it still remains 81.78% below its all-time high.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a turbulent albeit positive year with an SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) win and many acquisitions out of Ripple including toward real world asset tokenization,\u201d he said. \u201cExpect strong price trends for this payment rail.\u201d\n\nChainlink\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $14.66\n\nPast year: up 142%\n\nYear-to-date: up 164.85%\n\nPast 30 days: down 3.3%\n\nAll-time high: May 9, 2021, at $52.88\n\nAccording to Rafferty, the year-to-date rise demonstrates robust growth potential, standing 74% below its peak.\n\n\u201cPast bull run gains were 1400%+ and typically run prior to other players,\u201d he said. \u201cLINK\u2019s expansion into enterprise solutions, including collaborations with major players like Google, SWIFT, and Oracle, provides a vital security layer between blockchains and real-world data.\u201d\n\nOther Assets and Trends\n\nLee Taylor, the founder of MonarchX, said that in addition to Chainlink, if you\u2019re looking for the unicorn altcoins of 2024, I think Solana, Avalanche and Algorand should be top performers.\n\n\u201cALGO, which features low costs, is particularly well-suited to content creators. While seeing a dip earlier this year, it is up a whopping 38% over the past month, and it should continue to see high growth into 2024,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, AVAX is in a similar position, up over 75% in the past month alone. It is likely that these unicorns are well-positioned to see 100% growth over the next year.\n\nBitcoin-related assets, which have been on a roll lately, are also something worth watching, according to several experts.\n\nFor instance, \u201cOrdinals\u201d -NFTs on Bitcoin- or, as Decrypt explained, \u201cdigital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin,\u201d have garnered a lot of interest lately.\n\nNow, whether they have staying power remains to be seen, according to Grayscale\u2019s Pandl.\n\nAccording to Austin Alexander, co-founder of LayerTwo Labs, building on Bitcoin-related assets and networks is a big trend in the coming year.\n\n\u201cThere are many people who had never touched Bitcoin \u2013 they\u2019re altcoiners \u2013 who are now getting into Bitcoin because of Ordinals and other related assets,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin has the most liquidity of any decentralized network, and it\u2019s also the most secure, so this all makes BTC more desirable. Bitcoin\u2019s network effects are powerful, and I think we\u2019ll see the broader Bitcoin ecosystem flourish in the year ahead.\u201d\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Why Bitcoin, Ethereum and 2 More Cryptos Are Poised To Boom in 2024"

The filing on Wednesday lists Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht as a defendant, two claimants and the U.S. government as a plaintiff.\n\nThe U.S. government had already been in control of the crypto after it was handed over by a so-called \"Individual X\" who hacked into Silk Road and gained control of its funds, according to the original complaint.\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. Justice Department seized and began seeking the official forfeiture of the crypto, which at the time was valued at over $1 billion. A few days earlier, 69,369 bitcoins were moved out of a wallet address, marking the first such activity for the collected holdings since 2015, according to previous reporting by The Block.\n\nMovements of the funds are closely tracked, as market participants frequently speculate about the possible impact any large sale by the U.S. government could have on bitcoin's price.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBehind bars\n\nRoss Ulbricht, who is serving a life sentence in jail, founded the Silk Road and operated it from 2011 to 2013. The site was used for selling drugs and weapons and was shut down by the Federal Bureau of Investigation following the arrest of Ulbricht in late 2013.\n\nUlbricht agreed to use $3 billion in stolen bitcoin to pay debt to the U.S. government in 2022 and relinquished the right to 69,470 in bitcoin."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) skyrocketed in 2023, climbing an astonishing 158% as of the time of this writing. To put those gains in better context, the S&P 500 rose nearly 23% for the year.\n\nCryptocurrencies are often more volatile than the stock market, but why was so much optimism directed toward Bitcoin? Because investors believe the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be close to approving a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nDoing so would open Bitcoin investing to many more people and could, in turn, drive the value of Bitcoin even higher.\n\nInvestors are anticipating a Bitcoin ETF approval\n\nRight now, if you want to invest in Bitcoin, you essentially have to own the cryptocurrency. The problem with this, for some investors, is that you either need to own and store the digital tokens yourself or entrust them to be held by third parties.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF would allow investors to track the price of Bitcoin as it moves, with the ETF directly invested in Bitcoin. This means investors would own shares of Bitcoin assets in their brokerage account, with the ETF directly holding the Bitcoin assets.\n\nThere are a few key benefits of spot Bitcoin ETF:\n\nOur top crypto play isn't a token - Here\u2019s why We\u2019ve found one company that\u2019s positioned itself perfectly as a long-term picks-and-shovels solution for the broader crypto market \u2014 Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and all the others. In fact, you've probably used this company's technology in the past few days, even if you've never had an account or even heard of the company before. That's how prevalent it's become. Sign up today for Stock Advisor and get access to our exclusive report where you can get the full scoop on this company and its upside as a long-term investment. Learn more and get started today with a special new member discount. Get started\n\nCasual investors would have more access to Bitcoin investing.\n\nBuying an ETF in your brokerage account is much easier than owning and storing Bitcoin.\n\nThe ETF shares can be easily liquidated, making it easy to sell.\n\nETF tax rules are already in place, unlike confusing tax rules for crypto.\n\nIt gives investors a safer way to be exposed to cryptocurrencies.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF could bring more stability to Bitcoin price movements.\n\nReuters estimates there would be a lot of demand for a Bitcoin ETF, creating $3 billion worth of investment demand in just the first few days. If that happens, the price of Bitcoin could climb higher and add even more gains to Bitcoin's recent rise.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF approval may happen soon\n\nMore than a dozen firms have applied for the Bitcoin ETF, and Reuters reporting shows that the SEC may approve the ETF sometime in early January.\n\nIf it happens, then you may be able to invest in Bitcoin through your brokerage account soon. If you're considering buying it when it becomes available, ensure you're prepared for any potential volatility the ETF could experience.\n\nWhile the past year has been good for Bitcoin's price, there's no guarantee that it will continue trending upward. And any negative news involving cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin could send its price tumbling. For example, Bitcoin's price dropped by 64% in 2022 amid a pullback among investors from the crypto market.\n\nThe crypto market has experienced a lot of ups and downs recently, with the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the SEC bringing charges against another major exchange, Binance.\n\nAnd there is still inherent risk with digital currencies. For example, if a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved, the investment firms will own the digital currency and have to store it somewhere. Cryptocurrency theft among cybercriminals is already big business, and it could become even more lucrative if large brokerages begin buying substantial sums of Bitcoin.\n\nThat doesn't mean a Bitcoin ETF won't be worth investing in, but you need to be aware that cryptocurrency investing, even through an ETF, is likely to be more volatile than investing in the stock market."

        "title": "Understanding bitcoin's unique journey through 2023's crypto landscape - Tulsa World",
        "content": "Bitcoin has navigated a captivating journey, from its foundational principles of limited supply and mining dynamics to its resilience in the face of global challenges. By venturing through the highs and lows of the price of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency\u2019s market trajectory, we can unravel the complexities of its 2023 performance and peer into the future of this revolutionary digital asset.\n\nLimited Supply and Mining Dynamics\n\nBitcoin's uniqueness lies in its finite supply. With a cap of 21 million, over 19 million are currently in circulation, leaving less than 2 million to be mined. This scarcity is fundamental to Bitcoin's algorithm, potentially countering inflation and preserving its value. The creation of a new Bitcoin involves miners using specialized software to validate transaction blocks on the blockchain. Approximately 900 Bitcoins are mined daily, with the protocol automatically halving the issuance after every 210,000 blocks. The most recent halving occurred in May 2020, supporting the cryptocurrency's value and helping offset inflation.\n\nBitcoin's Resilience Amidst Challenges\n\nCryptocurrency faced a pivotal test during the COVID-19 pandemic. While traditional markets experienced turbulence, Bitcoin showcased its resilience. Starting 2020 at $6,950.56, a March selloff briefly dropped to $4,841.67. However, a rapid recovery followed, and by the year's end, Bitcoin soared to $29,402.64, a remarkable 323 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase.\n\n2021: Achieving New Heights\n\nIn 2021, Bitcoin achieved unprecedented milestones, reaching an all-time high of $68,649.05 in November. This surge, attributed to risk-on investor sentiment and Tesla's significant Bitcoin investment, marked a 98.82 percent increase from January. Despite a slight dip to $47,897.16 by year-end, Bitcoin demonstrated a commendable 62 percent YoY increase. Tesla's $1.5 billion Bitcoin investment and potential plans to accept Bitcoin for vehicle purchases significantly contributed to the 2021 rally. Despite subsequent scrutiny, the announcement of due diligence on renewable energy usage hinted at continued support. Increased money printing amid the pandemic also drove investors to diversify, benefitting Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin in 2023: Navigating Volatility\n\nDespite Bitcoin's notoriety and all-time highs, 2022 brought volatility. Prices dipped below $20,000 in Q2 but rebounded to nearly $24,000 in mid-January 2023. A subsequent drop to around $20,200 was followed by a rise to $28,211, showcasing Bitcoin's resilience in the face of market uncertainties. In Q2, despite SEC lawsuits against major platforms, the price of Bitcoin stabilized above $25,000, buoyed by BlackRock's filing for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Surpassing $30,000 in June and reaching $31,500 in July, Bitcoin demonstrated its strength even amid regulatory challenges.\n\nLooking Ahead: Bitcoin's Future\n\nAs of November 15, 2023, Bitcoin is trading at $37,885 BTC, benefiting from increased institutional investment and potential SEC approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Despite fluctuations, Bitcoin's performance, sustained growth, and future potential remain significant.\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain Technology & Increasing Awareness\n\nA blockchain serves as a decentralized public ledger for all cryptocurrency transactions. Constantly growing, completed blocks are added chronologically, making blockchain integral to various industries, including banking, cybersecurity, and supply chain management. As educational resources expand, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, once considered sophisticated, could become more accessible. The potential benefits, such as decentralization, financial inclusion, and privacy, are now understood by a broader audience.\n\nA deeper understanding of cryptocurrencies is debunking prevalent myths and misconceptions, offering a more realistic understanding of these digital assets and what they represent. Trust in new technologies, like cryptocurrencies, heavily relies on consumer awareness. Trust levels increase as people gain more knowledge about these digital assets and their operations, encouraging future adoption. Policymakers and regulators, becoming more informed, may develop fairer legislation as well. A clearer regulatory environment can facilitate the acceptance of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAwareness extends beyond individuals to institutions like banks and companies, which are gaining knowledge about cryptocurrencies. Growing public knowledge may be leading to increased popularity for cryptocurrencies along with technological advancements in the cryptocurrency field.\n\nPurchasing Bitcoin: A User's Guide\n\nBitcoin can be acquired through crypto exchanges like Coinbase Global, CoinSmart Financial, BlockFi, Binance, and Gemini. Users can store their Bitcoin in digital wallets, ensuring secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to traditional banking, attracting those seeking decentralized digital options. Privacy, quick transactions, and fewer fees make cryptocurrencies appealing. Recognizing the trend, some banks are increasingly investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\n\nBitcoin's Future: Volatility and Opportunity\n\nWhile Bitcoin has seen a resurgence in 2023, its inherent volatility remains notable, according to Bloomberg, Forbes, Binance, and Yahoo Finance. Given its historical profitability, investors open to risk may find opportunities in the cryptocurrency space. However, those seeking more stability might explore alternative investment avenues.\n\nBitcoin's journey from its humble beginnings to present-day highs showcases its resilience, adaptability, and potential for the future. Understanding its historical context, technological underpinnings, and the dynamics influencing its value positions investors to navigate the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies.\n\nInformation is intended for educational purposes only and is not to be used as investment advice. As with all investments, there is risk and the past performance of a particular asset class does not guarantee any future performance.\n\nLee Enterprises newsroom and editorial were not involved in the creation of this content."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Solana, and Near Protocol Jumped on Wednesday - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto market continued its bullish run on Wednesday with most of the major cryptocurrencies moving higher. There wasn't any major news about the industry overall, but small tidbits are giving investors enough reason to buy.\n\nBitcoin (BTC -6.26%) is up 3.2% over the last 24 hours as of 4 p.m. ET, Solana (SOL 6.63%) has jumped 10%, and Near Protocol (NEAR 7.46%) is up a whopping 18.6%.\n\nThe crypto industry takes small steps forward\n\nLast night it was announced that Blackrock, Nasdaq, and the Securities and Exchange Commission met yesterday for a second time to discuss rule changes to list a Bitcoin exhcnage-traded fund (ETF). The possibility of an ETF coming to market has been speculation all year and these appear to be at least small steps toward making that a reality.\n\nAn ETF could bring new money into the crypto industry by making it more accessible. It's still relatively difficult to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, so a low-cost exchange-traded fund would allow investors to get access without having crypto wallets or working with centralized crypto exchanges.\n\nSolana's rise continues, helped by news that it's now home to more decentralized trading volume than Ethereum. Solana's low cost and fast speed have made it a go-to blockchain for developers and that's helping push the token higher.\n\nNear Protocol is seeing an inflow of investor interest today as the blockchain attracts more developers and collaborations, opening up potential use cases.\n\nInvestors and utility\n\nThe two drivers of cryptocurrency right now are the flow of funds into the industry and the utility being built on the blockchain. All three of these cryptocurrencies are benefiting from that.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF could bring in more investors with a low-cost financial instrument and that could pave the way to more cryptocurrencies getting ETFs. And the SEC ruling positively, in this case, could lead to a thawing for crypto regulation in general.\n\nI think the long-term driver of the industry will be a growing number of use cases for the blockchain. From financial instruments to logistics uses, companies big and small are testing how they can use the blockchain. I think that will open up more use cases and companies built using this technology.\n\nIt's less clear how that will benefit specific tokens. Solana, for example, is so low-cost that even a large rise in transactions won't increase the fees, and tokens like the stablecoin USD Coin can be used as the medium of transaction.\n\nSpeculation is still rampant in crypto and that's driving a lot of the increase in value short-term. But there are improvements in the underlying technology and utility, which investors shouldn't overlook. And as long as there's an inflow of funds and an increase in innovation the market can keep moving higher."

        "content": "Major applicants for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States are amending their filings to comply with the cash redemption model demanded by securities regulators.\n\nInvestment manager BlackRock and Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest have updated their S-1 registration statements for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nFiled on Dec. 18, the S-1 amendments relate to the cash creation and redemption model for proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs, with BlackRock and ARK accepting the cash redemption system rather than in-kind redemptions, which imply non-monetary payments like BTC.\n\nARK\u2019s registration statement hinted that its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF would only allow cash creations and redemptions. The document mentioned \u201cpotential in-kind creation and redemption of shares,\u201d stating that the ETF may also permit authorized participants to create and redeem shares via in-kind transactions, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nBlackRock subsequently filed a similar update, stressing that in-kind transactions may take place but only subject to regulatory approval.\n\n\u201cThese transactions will take place in exchange for cash,\u201d BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF S-1 amendment reads, adding:\n\n\u201cSubject to the Nasdaq Stock Market receiving the necessary regulatory approval to permit the trust to create and redeem shares in-kind for Bitcoin, these transactions may also take place in exchange for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, ARK and its ETF partner 21Shares did not want to do cash creations and even worked out a creative alternative method to do in-kind redemptions. \u201cSo if they surrender, that tells you SEC not budging, the debate is over, which is probably good if you are looking for January approval,\u201d the analyst wrote.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s \u201ccash-only\u201d requirement means that the authorized participants (AP) will only be able to obtain more shares of the ETF by bringing the appropriate amount of cash to the table, according to investor and consultant Vance Harwood.\n\nRelated: Spot Bitcoin ETF will be \u2018bloodbath\u2019 for crypto exchanges, analyst says\n\n\u201cSome funds allow \u2018in-kind\u2019 creations too. For in-kind creations, the AP brings the asset that the ETF tracks and exchanges it for ETF shares. Apparently, the SEC is not keen on allowing this for spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d Harwood stated. He added that the SEC\u2019s position is \u201cunderstandable:\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will make it clear where the ETF gets its underlying Bitcoin from \u2014 the ETF will buy them, presumably from reputable exchanges, whereas if you allowed in-kind transfers you wouldn\u2019t be able to know where the Bitcoin transferred came from.\u201d\n\nThe global ETF provider WisdomTree also filed for an S-1 amendment to its spot Bitcoin ETF, the WisdomTree Bitcoin ETF, on Dec. 18, keeping the in-kind creation and redemption option.\n\n\u201cAuthorized participants, acting on the authority of the registered holder of shares, may surrender baskets in exchange for the corresponding amount of Bitcoin or cash,\u201d the registration statement reads, adding that APs may be able to create a basket or redeem through the in-kind option.\n\nFinance lawyer Scott Johnsson predicted in mid-December that ETF applicants would eventually have to bend their knee to using a cash creation and redemption model for their ETF. Previously, ETF applicants Invesco and Galaxy also updated their S-1 registration statements with the \u201ccash-only\u201d model.\n\nMagazine: Lawmakers\u2019 fear and doubt drives proposed crypto regulations in US"

        "content": "Bitcoin marked its third consecutive month of gains at the close of November, prompting a renewed interest in alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) that had initially picked up in October. Consequently, the total market value of all cryptocurrency projects, excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), has recently reached a peak last seen in August 2022.\n\nThe potential for an extensive \u201caltseason\u201d remains uncertain, but various industry sectors, previously inactive during the bear market, are beginning to exhibit early signs of revival. The Cointelegraph Research Monthly Trends report for December 2023 offers a comprehensive analysis of these emerging trends.\n\nThis month\u2019s edition covers a range of topics, including Bitcoin market trends, developments in decentralized finance (DeFi), movements in crypto stocks, venture capital (VC) activities, derivatives, mining sector updates and the progress in tokenization of real-world assets.\n\nDownload a PDF of the Report for free from the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.\n\nInfrastructure and Web3 lead the charge in crypto VC funding flood\n\nAmid persistent global geopolitical unrest and elevated interest rates in the European Union and the United States, the cryptocurrency VC sector experienced a surge in funding during November. Investment inflows reached $973 million through 93 separate deals, the most significant activity observed since June 2023, representing a nearly 40% increase from the previous month.\n\nThis contrasts sharply with October\u2019s performance, where only three deals exceeded $20 million. In November, however, there were five investments, each surpassing the $50 million threshold. This surge in capital inflow may be driven by a combination of positive news sentiment, the recent uptrend in the cryptocurrency market and a temporary halt in interest rate hikes by the United States Federal Reserve.\n\nThe infrastructure and Web3 sectors emerged as leaders in the number of funding rounds, recording 37 and 30 rounds, respectively. Centralized finance (CeFi) secured the second-highest investment volume this month, with $216.4 million distributed across five deals.\n\nThis unexpected surge can be largely attributed to two substantial funding events: Blockchain.com secured $110 million in a Series E funding round, and OSL, a centralized exchange operated by BC Technology Group in Hong Kong, completed a $90 million round. Following closely, the Web3 and DeFi sectors raised $160.5 million and $78.4 million, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, the nonfungible token (NFT) sector concluded the list with a relatively modest three funding rounds, amassing $11.5 million.\n\nBitcoin futures surge in popularity on the CME\n\nVenture capital activities and modest rallies in minor altcoins indicate a shift of capital toward higher-risk assets. This trend is anticipated to intensify following the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Leading ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Baluchnas recently increased their likelihood estimates for an approval by Jan. 10 to 90%.\n\nThis optimism is mirrored in the rising institutional interest in Bitcoin-based exchange-traded products. Evidence of this growing interest can be seen in the Bitcoin futures market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where open interest escalated by more than 20% in November.\n\nCointelegraph Research team\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s Research department comprises some of the best talents in the blockchain industry.

Since Amit's death, investigators have focused on locating data stored on his personal devices, which were presumed to hold crypto currency wallets. However, there is no trace of them so far.The ED produced Simpy before a court in Mumbai on Monday. The court remanded her into ED custody till December 26. The ED has also accused Simpy of creating a \"ruckus\" during the search on Sunday and helping Ajay Bhardwaj and her father-in-law escape.ED alleged that a company, Variabletech Pte Ltd, was registered in Singapore to seek investments in bitcoins. In its remand application, the ED said, \"Simpy Bhardwaj along with directors of Variabletech Pte Ltd, Amit Bhardwaj and Ajay Bhardwaj, hatched a criminal conspiracy in connivance with other accused persons to cheat the general public at large through its website www.gainbitcoin.com. It was projected by Simpy Bhardwaj and directors of Variabletech Private Limited, Singapore that this company is involved in block chain and cryptocurrency mining technology and has a mining farm in China and the company, through its cloud mining service provider (Gainbitcoin) acquires cloud mining hash power from large vendors by paying them in form of Bitcoins.\"ED alleged that Simpy and the directors offered investors cloud mining space for 18 months through a contract in exchange for assured returns of 10% per bitcoin for 18 months. As per the scheme, investors could buy bitcoins from any crypto currency exchange or from Bitex.com, a crypto currency exchange owned and controlled by Simpy Bhardwaj and others running Variabletech. The accused had a team of marketing personnel across India, who helped to tap a vast pool of investors.After the crackdown began, Amit's kin claimed that gadgets belonging to him which contained crypto wallet details had been stolen following his death. They said they were unaware where he had stored the funds collected in the form of bitcoins. In the last four years, police and ED teams have found no trace of the money."

Yahoo Finance UK looks back at the key personalities that shaped the landscape of the burgeoning web3 sector in 2023.\n\nThe past year has been witness to a rapid rebound for bitcoin, the largest digital asset by market capitalisation. Bitcoin has rallied by more than 170% since January, bringing much of the rest of the cryptocurrency market along with it.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin is up \u2014 and the zealots are back\n\nHowever, the crypto sector in 2023 was in recovery mode after a series of scandals from 2022 eroded investor confidence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne of the most prominent being the collapse of FTX, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges. This downfall led to the conviction of FTX's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, for fraud and money laundering.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was found guilty at a court in New York of seven counts of fraud and money laundering.

FTX reached a valuation of over $30bn at its peak.\n\nHowever, Bankman-Fried's empire crumbled in November 2022 when news broke that FTX had been engaging in a variety of illegal activities, including loaning customer funds to Alameda Research, a hedge fund that he also operated, without their knowledge or consent.\n\nThese revelations sparked a bank run on FTX, forcing the exchange to file for bankruptcy and leaving investors with significant losses.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Sam Bankman-Fried \u2018to break his silence\u2019 over catastrophic FTX collapse\n\nBankman-Fried's trial, which lasted less than a month, centred on the alleged misuse of customer funds and the creation of a fraudulent scheme to inflate the value of FTX's own cryptocurrency, FTT. After a swift deliberation, the jury found him guilty of all charges.\n\nHis conviction sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency world, shaking investor confidence and highlighting the need for stricter regulatory oversight.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao admitted failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering programme.

However, Zhao's meteoric rise was marred by controversy.\n\nIn November 2023, he pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering programme. The plea came as Binance agreed to pay over $4bn as part of a settlement with the US government.\n\nThe charge stemmed from revelations that the Binance cryptocurrency exchange was being used to launder illicit funds. The US Department of Justice said the exchange had failed to implement adequate measures to prevent this activity, exposing its users to the risk of being associated with criminals.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin falls on Binance fraud charge fear\n\nFollowing the charges, Zhao stepped down as CEO of Binance and pleaded guilty to breaking US anti-money laundering laws.\n\nThe deal with the US Department of Justice will see Zhao personally pay $50m, described by prosecutors as one of the largest corporate penalties in US history.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin oversaw transformative developments for the world's first 'smart contract' blockchain.

The SEC's role in safeguarding US investors and regulating the extensive US capital markets,\n\nIndustry observers have studied Gensler's comments and actions throughout the year to ascertain whether he is relaxing his critical stance on the sector. Ultimately, Gensler will be responsible for how the US enforces securities laws on the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nCritics of the SEC chair have argued for clearer rule-making for the industry and even the adaptation of existing securities laws to fit the innovations coming from the sector. However, there has been no sign that Gensler will deviate from existing rules and regulations when it comes to crypto.\n\nMicroStrategy chair Michael Saylor has overseen MicroStrategy's stock surging by 275% in 2023.

The company's stock surge, which has risen by 250% this year, has outperformed bitcoin, reflecting its investment in both software and BTC.
