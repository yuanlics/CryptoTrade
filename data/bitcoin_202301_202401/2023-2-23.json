        "title": "Gary Gensler on Meeting With SBF and His Crypto Crackdown - New York Magazine",
        "content": "Photo: Shuran Huang/The New York Times\n\nAs recently as a year ago, Sam Bankman-Fried seemed to be an unstoppable force in official Washington. The conspicuously disheveled founder and CEO of FTX had positioned himself as a new sort of billionaire and crypto entrepreneur \u2014 someone who promised to do good with his extraordinary wealth, who had publicly discussed supporting Democratic political candidates to the tune of a billion dollars in upcoming elections, and who seemed to offer the possibility of legitimizing an industry that had grown exponentially during the pandemic while operating on the fringes of America\u2019s financial regulatory apparatus.\n\nBy last March, things appeared to be going exceptionally well for Bankman-Fried as he prepared for a private meeting with Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We now know that Bankman-Fried was in the midst of executing a dual-pronged political and media strategy that looks to have been one of the most ambitious political-influence operations in recent memory. He was testifying before Congress about how to regulate crypto markets, and behind closed doors, he was successfully lobbying for a bill that would have enacted a system that was very beneficial to him. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried was schmoozing with (and offering money to) a group of self-styled policy professionals and political pundits whose unofficial seal of approval conferred an aura of intellectual seriousness on his project.\n\nAt the time of his meeting with Gensler, Bankman-Fried was in the process of acquiring a stake in the stock exchange IEX, and he was joined by a group of FTX and IEX representatives to pitch a new SEC-approved crypto-trading platform. They included a top FTX lawyer who had worked with Gensler and who, in private, had reportedly bragged about his access to \u201cGary.\u201d This meeting was coming on the heels of a dinner Bankman-Fried arranged with the SEC\u2019s incoming general counsel, Dan Berkovitz. (Berkowitz recently stepped down.)\n\nBut things did not go as planned for the FTX and IEX crew at that meeting last March. They were evidently seeking agency approval for a so-called \u201calternative trading system,\u201d a more lightly regulated alternative to national securities exchanges. Gensler, in his telling, sharply rebuffed the group.\n\n\u201cI indicated to them they could take their slide deck down on the second slide,\u201d Gensler told me during a recent and wide-ranging conversation, \u201cand that I didn\u2019t think that they should \u2014 with all respect \u2014 that it was not a valuable use of their time.\u201d\n\nAccording to Gensler, FTX was far too conflicted to satisfy the agency\u2019s regulations. He said that he told the group \u201cthat alternative trading systems were something amongst and for institutional investors\u201d and that \u201cjust coming into compliance was going to need them to disaggregate their business to address the conflicts \u2014 that they should have a separate exchange, separate broker-dealer, separate custody, and that they were in the national security exchange Zip Code, not in the ATS Zip Code.\u201d (The outcome of the meeting was first reported by the New York Times.)\n\nIt was not the first time that Gensler met with Bankman-Fried and other FTX representatives \u2014 there was also a previously disclosed session in late 2021 \u2014 but when we spoke, it was unclear whether there had been any other meetings between the two men, which might raise further questions among the public about Bankman-Fried\u2019s access to U.S. regulators. Gensler\u2019s calendars for 2022 have not yet been fully released, so questions on this front have persisted.\n\nSo were there any other meetings between the two? \u201cNo,\u201d Gensler quickly responded when I put the question to him directly.\n\nGensler\u2019s brushback last March may have helped to limit the extraordinary fallout in the sector last year, though of course, plenty of people have been caught without their coats in the harsh and unsparing deep freeze of crypto winter. Retail investors have lost extraordinary sums, there has been a wave of large crypto bankruptcies, and evidence of rampant fraud in the industry, which was already abundant, continues to accumulate.\n\nIt is also eminently reasonable to ask whether the SEC could \u2014 and should \u2014 have done more to crack down on the industry before now. It is, after all, comparatively easy to aggressively go after companies or their principals after their businesses have been exposed by the press or competitors as financially unsound or perhaps even fundamentally fraudulent enterprises, and given the publicly available information, it is fair to question whether the SEC should have pursued concerns about the industry more quickly and assertively than it did in recent years.\n\nThe political fallout from the implosion of FTX and the criminal indictment of Bankman-Fried is far from over. It has embarrassed prominent figures throughout Washington. Whether it will have any implications for Gensler, by all accounts an ambitious player in the Biden administration, is still an open question.\n\nIt all occurred at a precarious time for him. He was already under fire for an ambitious regulatory agenda that had drawn the ire of Wall Street and generated internal frustration among SEC staff, and some of the same members of Congress who criticized Gensler last year for investigating the industry too aggressively, including New York congressman Ritchie Torres and Minnesota representative Tom Emmer, have since sought to blame Gensler for the FTX disaster.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been reports since last summer suggesting the possibility of a change of leadership at the Treasury Department, where Secretary Janet Yellen has had to deal with widespread public anxiety over inflation. Gensler began his career in government service at Treasury in the late 1990s after nearly two decades at Goldman Sachs, and there have been slight rumblings, which have made their way into the financial press, that Gensler might be interested in leading the department if Yellen decides to leave at some point in the coming years, particularly if Biden is reelected.\n\nAll of this raises the stakes for the 65-year-old, as he mounts a public defense of the SEC\u2019s record on crypto regulation and enforcement, including during our discussion. We talked about how the industry tried to outmaneuver Congress and the country\u2019s financial regulators, as well as how crypto markets should be regulated, but Gensler also made clear that he has been grappling with the same question as many of the rest of us: What, exactly, is the point of crypto?\n\nFrom the vantage point of today, it is clear that Bankman-Fried was very close to building what has been fairly described as a \u201cregulatory moat\u201d around FTX \u2014 locking in a role for himself and his company at the top of the crypto industry. The legislation that he backed, called the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, would have given the Commodity Futures Trading Commission authority to regulate certain crypto products \u2014 specifically, bitcoin, ether, and other vaguely identified \u201cdigital commodities\u201d \u2014 and displaced the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction in the area. It was an ambitious but straightforward strategy of domestic regulatory arbitrage that would have effectively allowed the company to pick its own regulator in the U.S. (Though, of course, the March meeting with Gensler shows that Bankman-Fried was looking for regulatory buy-in from all relevant agencies.)\n\nFairly or not, the CFTC is generally regarded as a more pliant and less assertive financial regulator than the SEC. It was therefore not that surprising when the head of the CFTC disclosed that Bankman-Fried had met with him and other senior officials at the agency ten times over roughly the year leading up to the collapse of the FTX, despite concerns raised in real time by commodities specialists.\n\n\u201cI love the CFTC,\u201d said Gensler, who ran the agency during the Obama administration, as we touched on these uncomfortable facts, implicating some of his former and current colleagues. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get me to say anything negative about\u201d the CFTC, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just too \u2014 it\u2019s in my blood.\u201d\n\nStill, he was unsparing in his assessment of the merits of the legislative effort, which was spearheaded in the Senate by Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow. The bill, Gensler told me, would have \u201cunambiguously undermined investor protection\u201d thanks to the vague legislative text that was on the table. \u201cWe live in a world where Amazon stock and U.S. treasuries are already digital,\u201d Gensler explained. \u201cSo many of the bills, literally, you could take the $24 trillion treasury market, put it on a blockchain ledger, and take it outside of the current regime\u201d of federal regulation. (This may sound a bit dry in Gensler\u2019s phrasing, but to be clear, it would be a radical and crazy outcome.)\n\nThe new Congress is looking again at crypto-specific legislation, but Gensler believes that the SEC has all of the legal tools that it needs. Over the course of our discussion, he articulated a straightforward view of the agency\u2019s reach \u2014 that pretty much every sort of crypto transaction already falls under the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction except spot transactions in bitcoin itself and the actual purchase or sale of goods or services with cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cEverything other than bitcoin,\u201d Gensler told me, \u201cyou can find a website, you can find a group of entrepreneurs, they might set up their legal entities in a tax haven offshore, they might have a foundation, they might lawyer it up to try to arbitrage and make it hard jurisdictionally or so forth.\u201d In other words, there are people behind these cryptocurrencies using a variety of complex and legally opaque mechanisms, but at the most basic level, they are trying to promote their tokens and entice investors. (Bitcoin, because of its unique history and creation story, is fundamentally different from other crypto projects in this respect.)\n\n\u201cThey might drop their tokens overseas at first and contend or pretend that it\u2019s going to take six months before they come back to the U.S.,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut at the core,\u201d he argued, \u201cthese tokens are securities because there\u2019s a group in the middle and the public is anticipating profits based on that group.\u201d The claim that crypto investors are hoping to profit based on the efforts of those intermediaries \u2014 in much the same way that stockholders in public companies hope to see their investments appreciate over time \u2014 is central to Gensler\u2019s position that, as a legal matter, these are actually transactions in securities that fall within the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nAs a matter of securities law, Gensler\u2019s view is not that hard to understand, though it is still being tested in the courts. The agency racked up a significant win last November, but there are other pending legal rulings that are eagerly awaited by industry observers, and there is a well-resourced crypto lobby that is not likely to back down anytime soon.\n\nFor now, the SEC has emerged as the industry\u2019s primary civil regulator, whether crypto advocates like it or not \u2014 but there are still plenty of big questions about what the agency has been up to in recent years and what its current enforcement strategy will actually achieve. Arguably the federal government\u2019s actions \u2014 including those of the SEC \u2014 didn\u2019t do much to prevent the loss of trillions of dollars in value over the last year, potentially impacting tens of millions of Americans who hold crypto assets in some form.\n\nGensler was extremely diplomatic about it when we spoke, but a large part of this mess is attributable to the Trump administration\u2019s extremely lax approach to financial fraud and regulation, as well as the credulousness of the industry\u2019s supporters in Congress. \u201cIn terms of policy-makers around the globe,\u201d Gensler explained, \u201cyou had this ascendancy in the crypto market during the COVID period and low interest rates,\u201d during which time the market grew \u201cfrom $250 billion to $3 trillion.\u201d\n\nCapitol Hill was also an important player in the mess. Many members of Congress \u2014 \u201cgood faith, hardworking members of Congress,\u201d Gensler was quick to add \u2014 felt compelled to meet with industry advocates and hear them out about the supposed financial revolution that they were ushering in. According to Gensler, members of Congress \u201cwere hearing about crypto increasingly because the retail public was also caught up\u201d thanks to things like Super Bowl advertising and support from celebrities like Kim Kardashian. In the downturn that followed, Gensler\u2019s agency has brought charges against various high-profile crypto opportunists, including Kardashian, who settled an enforcement action last October.\n\nGensler has said that the \u201croadway\u201d or \u201crunway\u201d for crypto firms that are not registered with the SEC is \u201cgetting shorter,\u201d but the metaphor is an odd one. The planes are already in the air, so the agency is really trying to ground them.\n\nThat explains a series of significant moves by the agency since the start of the year \u2014 including a major enforcement action against two prominent crypto firms based on an unregistered crypto asset lending program; a recent settlement with a crypto exchange based on an industry practice known as \u201cstaking\u201d; and notice of a potential enforcement action against a stablecoin issuer whose product is affiliated with Binance.\n\nGensler broadly referred to these kinds of firms, which seem to differ endlessly in their offerings and corporate structures, as \u201cstorefronts\u201d that are providing services to the public \u201cin a way that\u2019s commingled and is rife with conflicts.\u201d He argued that many of them combine functions that would have to be legally disaggregated in traditionally regulated markets, including roles that would ordinarily be separated among some combination of exchanges, lenders, market-makers, broker-dealers, investment advisers, and custodians.\n\n\u201cThe conflicts in these storefronts,\u201d Gensler told me, \u201cwe do not allow in traditional finance, we don\u2019t allow in the securities markets, we don\u2019t allow it in the commercial banking markets, and we don\u2019t allow it in crypto because these storefronts are fundamentally and generally noncompliant with the securities laws as we know them.\u201d He argued that network effects have made \u201ca small handful of storefronts\u201d particularly important, but \u201cwhether they call themselves lending or staking as a service or exchanges, they\u2019re bringing together millions of customers.\u201d\n\nOn its face, the idea that an increase in SEC registrations and filings from crypto companies will somehow markedly improve the integrity and resilience of this market seems dubious. Last February, the crypto lender BlockFi agreed to register with the SEC at the agency\u2019s urging, paid a $100 million fine, and then went bankrupt in November. The stark turn of events seemed to reflect, at least in part, the fact that the underlying crypto asset class is both novel and unstable, and that this is not an industry with consistent and widely accepted valuation, marking, or disclosure conventions.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the implosion of BlockFi seemed to reflect the legal and practical limits of the SEC\u2019s strategy to force more crypto firms to register with the agency. That is because companies that register with the SEC may have to satisfy more detailed and burdensome disclosure requirements, but that does not mean that those companies or their business models will magically become more stable or financially sound.\n\nThe unstated premise of the SEC\u2019s current enforcement push appears to be that if the government can broadly stigmatize the industry and market participants, then ordinary people \u2014 the retail investors all over the world who have gotten swept up in the crypto frenzy of recent years \u2014 might think long and hard about whether to hold these assets in any form. It is a message that federal regulators recently delivered directly to the banking industry, warning them not to issue or hold any crypto assets because doing so would be \u201chighly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.\u201d\n\nI asked Gensler whether federal regulators with consumer-facing responsibilities should send a comparable message to retail investors, but he gently resisted. \u201cI\u2019m in a job where I\u2019m supposed to be merit neutral in terms of what risk investors want to take,\u201d he told me at one point, \u201cbut not neutral towards the investor protection \u2014 the full, fair, and truthful disclosure you get when you\u2019re investing in a security.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most telling answer I got from Gensler over the course of our discussion was when I asked him to explain the legitimate use case for crypto: What is the actual point of this new sector, and could it actually provide a valuable economic or financial service for ordinary people and the global economy?\n\nGensler was careful to draw a sharp distinction between two types of supposed innovations promoted by crypto\u2019s earliest advocates. The first is the idea of a distributed accounting ledger \u2014 the blockchain technology that came into the world with Bitcoin\u2019s invention \u2014 that is in theory more transparent, accessible, and resilient against theft and cyberattacks than centralized ledgers. Gensler clearly admired the technical creation. \u201cI personally think it\u2019s very rare that you need that, but it\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real innovation.\u201d\n\nThe second, of course, is the notion that cryptocurrencies might actually provide a useful store of value or alternative payment mechanism, and on that point, Gensler appeared to be much less impressed.\n\n\u201cHistory tells us throughout \u2014 through antiquity to now \u2014 that economies coalesce around one monetary unit,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a network effect to having one unit that we humans accept as a medium of exchange and unit of account \u2014 a store of value \u2014 one unit. The two things governments do since Genghis Khan,\u201d he observed, \u201cis basically say, \u2018This is what\u2019s accepted for your taxes, and it\u2019s accepted for all debts, public and private.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much economic use for a micro-currency, and we haven\u2019t seen one in centuries,\u201d Gensler said. \u201cMost of these tokens will fail, because the question is about these economics. What\u2019s the \u2018there\u2019 there?\u201d\n\nIt was a diplomatic answer for someone who is tasked with reigning in a well-funded and well-lawyered industry that many people believe is generally useless and economically wasteful. Here is a simpler way of thinking about it if you are an ordinary investor who bought \u201cshitcoins\u201d in recent years, perhaps because of the celebrity endorsements, the high-profile ads, or plain-old fear of missing out: Get out while you can."

        "title": "The Bitcoin ETF Debate - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has sparked heated debate over its regulation and acceptance. One of the major points of contention is whether regulatory authorities should approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nIn this article, we'll look at the benefits and drawbacks of a Bitcoin ETF, as well as the future of this contentious asset.\n\nBenefits of a Bitcoin ETF\n\nA Bitcoin ETF would give investors an easy and familiar way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to hold and store the asset themselves. This would allow more retail investors to invest in Bitcoin, potentially increasing demand, and price.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF would also allow investors to track the price of Bitcoin without having to deal with the technical complexities of directly holding and trading Bitcoin.\n\nKeep Reading Social Media Reward Coins: A Catalyst for Widespread Crypto Adoption\n\nA Bitcoin ETF has piqued the interest of institutional investors, who would be able to invest in the asset class without violating their investment mandates. Many institutional investors have restrictions on investing in assets that have not been registered with regulatory authorities, as Bitcoin is currently.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF may also help to reduce volatility in the Bitcoin market. Currently, the price of Bitcoin is heavily influenced by news and events in the cryptocurrency market. A Bitcoin ETF could potentially stabilize the market and reduce the impact of news and events by providing a regulated and centralized platform for trading Bitcoin.\n\nThe Drawbacks of a Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe possibility of market manipulation is one of the main arguments against a Bitcoin ETF. The cryptocurrency market's lack of regulation and oversight has raised concerns about market manipulation and price volatility.\n\nBy allowing investors to short or long Bitcoin on a regulated exchange, a Bitcoin ETF could potentially provide a platform for market manipulation.\n\nAnother source of concern is the possibility that a Bitcoin ETF will increase the risk of fraud and theft. Bitcoin security has always been a concern, with numerous high-profile hacks and thefts over the years.\n\nBecause a Bitcoin ETF would hold a significant amount of Bitcoin, it would be an appealing target for hackers and thieves.\n\nFinally, there is concern that a Bitcoin ETF could cause a Bitcoin market bubble. Bitcoin has already seen several bubbles in its short history, and a Bitcoin ETF could potentially attract more speculative investors, pushing the price to unsustainable levels.\n\nBTC vs BTC ETF: What\u2019s the Better Investment?\n\nSurely many have wondered what\u2019s best: to buy a BTC ETF or just buy BTC directly. To answer that question there are many advantages and disadvantages to buying a Bitcoin ETF you should know about.\n\nConvenience at a cost\n\nFirst and foremost, investing in a BTC ETF is a direct way of diversifying into the crypto market without actually being in the cryptocurrency market, without signing up for crypto exchanges, without taking on the inherent risk of owning crypto and, more importantly, without needing to learn the ins and outs of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, that very same convenience comes with three inherent disadvantages:\n\n1. Management fees: when you buy cryptocurrency, that\u2019s the end of it. However, by deliberately choosing to invest in an ETF, you\u2019ll certainly have to factor in management fees. And, as we all know, these fees can be significant over time.\n\n2. Inability to trade crypto: BTC can be traded. As such, if you own BTC, you can trade it for any cryptocurrency you like. However, investing in a BTC ETF doesn\u2019t allow you to do the same as you won\u2019t be eligible for trading it for cryptocurrency.\n\n3. Lack of ownership: Many see Bitcoin as a way of mitigating risks that lie within the traditional financial system. Hedging against central banks is the thesis of many Bitcoin maximalists. Moreover, BTC and the blockchain provide some level of privacy, something which an ETF simply cannot match.\n\nDiversification and taxes\n\nBitcoin ETFs should mean diversification as they claim to provide investors with ways of mitigating risks (by bundling BTC with, for example, stocks).\n\nAs for taxation, BTC ETFs are much more tax efficient as opposed to BTC which is decentralized in nature and unregulated.\n\nSo, as an investment strategy, the answer will ultimately come down to whatever your goals are. If you plan to navigate the cryptocurrency universe, perhaps it\u2019s best to outright buy crypto. If the plan is a long term investment, BTC is the better investment as you won\u2019t be met with maintenance fees. However, if you don\u2019t plan to invest and get to know how cryptocurrency works, an ETF will do just fine.\n\nThe Way Forward\n\nThe debate over a Bitcoin ETF has raged on for several years, with regulatory authorities rejecting several proposals. However, the landscape is shifting, and the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could be closer than ever.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first Bitcoin futures ETF in October 2021. (SEC). While it is not a traditional Bitcoin ETF, it does provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin futures contracts traded on regulated exchanges.\n\nAs it demonstrates that Bitcoin can be traded on a regulated platform, this could pave the way for a Bitcoin ETF in the future.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF was approved in Canada in February 2021, allowing investors to invest in Bitcoin through a regulated ETF. The success of the Canadian Bitcoin ETF could provide regulatory authorities with additional evidence that a Bitcoin ETF can be regulated and provide investors with a safe and secure way to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF debate is far from over, and investors and regulators alike will continue to debate the pros and cons of a Bitcoin ETF. While a Bitcoin ETF would offer investors a simple and familiar way to invest in Bitcoin. It also carries risks, such as the possibility of market manipulation and theft.\n\nThe approval of the first Bitcoin futures ETF in the United States, as well as the success of the Canadian Bitcoin ETF, are both encouraging signs for the future of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhile regulatory authorities must address the concerns raised by a Bitcoin ETF, the growing interest in Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market suggests that a Bitcoin ETF may become a viable investment option in the future.\n\nThe regulatory environment is likely to evolve as the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and mature. The risks associated with a Bitcoin ETF could be mitigated with increased regulation and oversight, making it a safer investment option for both retail and institutional investors.\n\nIndividual investor preferences and risk tolerance will ultimately determine whether or not to invest in a Bitcoin ETF. A Bitcoin ETF may be a convenient and regulated way to invest in Bitcoin, but it may not be the best option for all investors.\n\nTo summarize, the debate over a Bitcoin ETF is complex and multifaceted, with both advantages and disadvantages to consider. While a Bitcoin ETF may offer investors a regulated and secure way to invest in Bitcoin, there are risks that must be addressed.\n\nThe approval of the first Bitcoin futures ETF in the United States, as well as the success of the Canadian Bitcoin ETF, are encouraging signs for the future of a Bitcoin ETF, and it will be interesting to see how the regulatory environment and investor interest in Bitcoin evolve in the coming years."

        "content": "Online payments giant Block reported on Thursday strong growth in revenue and gross profit in the fourth quarter, as the main stalwarts of its business, digital wallet CashApp and business payments platform Square, showed large gains.\n\nThe company posted $1.66 billion in gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2022, an almost 40% increase from nearly $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue was $4.65 billion, a jump from $4.1 billion in the same quarter of 2021. CashApp and Square drove most of those gains, as CashApp posted a staggering 64% jump in year-over-year gross profit, and Square had 22%.\n\nIn after-hours trading, share prices rose approximately 8% percent from $74 to $80.\n\nThe company reported quarterly earnings per share of 22 cents, compared with an estimate of 30 cents per share by analysts polled by FactSet. Block, however, beat predictions on revenue and gross profit.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead to 2023 and beyond, we are focused on balancing growth and efficiency and will prioritize speed, agility, and accountability,\u201d Block CEO Jack Dorsey and CFO Amrita Ahuja wrote in a letter to shareholders.\n\nThe outlook, however, for the company\u2019s dive into Bitcoin was more tepid. Block invested $220 million in Bitcoin in 2020 and 2021, but the company\u2019s Bitcoin holdings were valued at just $133 million at the end of 2022.\n\nIts Bitcoin trading business on CashApp also declined. Total fourth-quarter revenue from Bitcoin sales on CashApp was $1.83 billion, down from $1.96 billion in the same quarter in 2021, and its year-over-year gross profits from the cryptocurrency decreased from approximately $46 million to $35 million, a mere fraction of Block\u2019s total gross profit.\n\nIn 2018, Dorsey, a notable Bitcoin evangelist, announced that CashApp users would be able to buy and sell Bitcoin through the digital wallet. And more than two years later, the company, formerly known as Square, made significant investments in the cryptocurrency. To signify his company\u2019s devotion to crypto, Dorsey then announced that the payments titan would be changing its name to Block. Since then, he has continued to double down on Bitcoin.\n\nDorsey announced the creation of TBD, a Block subsidiary that soon released a white paper detailing plans for the construction of a decentralized Bitcoin trading exchange. After the fall of FTX, Block also announced that it\u2019s developing a new wallet to allow its customers to hold Bitcoin themselves, rather than having tokens handled by third parties. And the company has even recently invested in a Bitcoin mining firm that says it is trying to bring cheap energy to places like Kenya and Malawi."

        "content": "The bitcoin narrative has veered far away from early investors' vision of it enabling economic freedom, at least in the U.S. But for many in the Black community, that narrative is still alive and it's imperative that people stay focused on it.\n\nBitcoin's core values \u2013 decentralization, censorship resistance, its peer-to-peer nature \u2013 get pushed to the side time and again as the industry tries to grow in a world run by intermediary institutions. Opening an account at a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Kraken (or, until recently, FTX) is the easiest and most common way to get into crypto. And it's safe to bet most people are playing the speculation game, trading crypto on an exchange instead of transacting directly with another person as bitcoin was intended.\n\nThere's a long game to play, however, particularly for the Black community. Thanks to bitcoin's core values, anyone can store their wealth or move it around on the network and no one person can stop or control that. For Black people, that's a golden opportunity to level the playing field and give them \"sovereignty\" over their wealth, said Lamar Wilson, founder of crypto-focused network Black Bitcoin Billionaire.\n\n\"A lot of our history with America has not been the greatest,\" Wilson told CNBC. \"Whenever Black people have put their money into things in the past to build wealth in this country, it has been coerced out of their hands, it has been taken from them, it has been burned down or destroyed.\"\n\nIn the 1800s, Seneca Village, Manhattan's first known community of African-American property owners, was destroyed to build Central Park, for example. The Tulsa race massacre, also known as the Black Wall Street massacre, happened in 1921 when a white mob burned the wealthiest Black community in the U.S. to the ground in the Greenwood district of Tulsa, Oklahoma. A couple years later in California, Manhattan Beach officials forced out Willa and Charles Bruce claiming eminent domain. That land was returned to the Bruce family last year.\n\n\"Bitcoin is an asset that you can actually store and hold yourself and no one can take you,\" Wilson said. \"This provides a way to be part of an asset that is globally liquid around the world.\"\n\nFast forward to today, and Black people still largely start their wealth building journeys from behind. According to an FDIC survey, the proportion of U.S. households that were unbanked in 2021 was the lowest it's been (4.5%) since the bank regulator began the survey in 2009. Still, within that group, at every income level, there's a big difference in the unbanked rates between Black and white households. Ultimately, that discrepancy shows up in the stock market's racial investing gap."

        "title": "Bitcoin 2024 halving will be its 'most important' \u2014 Interview with Charles Edwards - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) stands at the start of a \u201cnew regime\u201d after its early 2023 price gains, and next year will prove pivotal.\n\nThat is the opinion of Charles Edwards, founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments.\n\nAs investment behavior around Bitcoin recovers in line with network fundamentals and price action, Edwards, perhaps like many other institutional professionals, is gearing up for an explosive period of growth.\n\nThe jury may still be out on whether the bottom is in for BTC\u2019s price, but for long-term investors, the time to allocate is just beginning, he argues.\n\nIn an extensive interview with Cointelegraph, Edwards reflects on the prospects for Bitcoin and the crypto industry in the coming years and whether the 2023 rebound has legs.\n\nLooking ahead, next year\u2019s block subsidy halving will be especially important as Bitcoin becomes, in his words, the \u201chardest asset in the world with certainty.\u201c\n\nCointelegraph (CT): Bitcoin\u2019s NVT metric is now at two-year highs. You said this is \u201cshowing indications of value normalization and the start of a new market regime.\u201d What is NVT, and why is this a big deal?\n\nCharles Edwards (CE): NVT is often referred to as the Bitcoin version of a \u201cPE Ratio\u201d \u2013 a simple yardstick for relative value of the network. NVT is network value to transaction value. It is the ratio of Bitcoin\u2019s U.S. dollar market capitalization to the 90-day average U.S. dollar transaction volume that flows through on-chain Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe reasoning is simple. If Bitcoin\u2019s network is used to settle a lot of transaction value, then the network should be worth more. So, when NVT is relatively low, it means the market is undervaluing Bitcoin versus the value of transactions it is securely settling.\n\nOne way to identify the relative value of NVT is using Dynamic Range NVT; this applies two-year Bollinger Bands to the NVT ratio. When NVT hits the lower band, Bitcoin has historically been very cheap (a better value buy); when it hits the top band, it has been relatively expensive (a time to manage risk).\n\nBitcoin spent most of the second half of 2022 in the $16\u201320,000 region, and during this time it was trading at the lower NVT band \u2014 a signal for great long-term value. As of February 2023, NVT has broken out above fair value. This can be a signal that we are in a new regime, the early stages of a new bull market. However, as of writing, NVT is fast approaching the overvaluation band. We are not there yet, but we could be in for some near-term volatility.\n\nCT: How confident are you that Bitcoin is now in a \u201cnew regime\u201d or bull cycle?\n\nCE: There is a very good chance this is the start of a new regime, the early stages of a Bitcoin bull market. We have all the signs of a typical turning point on value and sentiment. This is not to say I expect price to dramatically rally upward from here like it did in January; the early stages of Bitcoin bull markets typically involve a 6\u201312 month period of volatility and an overall slow trend and grind up. My base case is a positive 2023, with the more significant cyclical growth and returns coming in 2024.\n\nHere are some of the reasons why I see a new regime forming today. As of January 2023, we have:\n\nJust exited a period of deep value as defined by many on-chain metrics, including Bitcoin trading at its electrical cost for two months ending this January. Historically this is the global price floor for Bitcoin and this was the second-longest period spent at the electrical cost in Bitcoin\u2019s history (the first was 2016).\n\nCompletely eclipsed the price collapse of the third-biggest fraud of all time in just two months. Despite the industry\u2019s great loss of wealth to millions of people, Bitcoin has demonstrated that there are very few marginal sellers left, and the level of deep value is too much to maintain prices this cheap for long, regardless of such negative news.\n\nA major technical price confirmation and confirmed fakeout at the most important price level on the Bitcoin chart \u2014 the old $20,000 all-time high and the point of the FTX collapse.\n\nWitnessed a 40% short squeeze with identical characteristics to the 2021 China mining ban Bitcoin price bottom.\n\nEntered a new regime of upward momentum, confirmed across multiple long-term moving averages commonly referenced in major markets.\n\nAre having an optimal halving cycle timing where Bitcoin typically bottoms (Q4 2022 and Q1 2023).\n\nThe Bitcoin cycle drawdown hit typical 80% levels in late 2022.\n\nIn November/December 2022, sentiment was at its worst, and market hedging at its highest on record.\n\nA likely Fed rate pause and change of policy is due in 2023.\n\nCT: What was the significance of the $20,000 breakout in January?\n\nCE: The $20,000 breakout was the most important price movement we have seen since the all-time high in 2021. $20,000 is important for many reasons:\n\nIt is the 2017 (prior Bitcoin cycle) all-time high.\n\nIt is the price level that the FTX fraud was exposed at, and the third-biggest exchange (and top three fraud in human history) collapsed at in 2021.\n\nIt is perhaps the most important price order block level on the Bitcoin chart.\n\nIt has significance as major round number support.\n\nIt is at the intersection of Bitcoin\u2019s electrical and production costs \u2014 the region where Bitcoin miners become unprofitable and the level historically representing a price floor.\n\nWhen Bitcoin collapsed below $20,000 in November 2022, it signified a failing of major technical support. It made most Bitcoin miners unprofitable and was the climax of fraud, collapse, bankruptcies and negative sentiment in the industry. We spent two months below $20,000 before a 40% short squeeze took us back above $21,000. From a technical perspective, this represented a clean deviation below major support and is a technical movement that often represents the start of a new trend in the opposite direction.\n\nWhen an asset price moves suddenly in one direction, then shortly after moves suddenly in the opposite direction, it\u2019s the second move which tends to \u201cstick\u201d and generate a higher probability of a new trend. The probability of the second move being the correct move is significantly higher than that of the first move. That\u2019s what makes deviation fakeout signals like this one so powerful \u2014 especially at such an important level like $20,000.\n\nCT: Scrutiny of exchange solvency appears to be fading compared to previous months. Is the FTX debacle behind us?\n\nCE: I believe so. The FTX situation was a massive outlier. It\u2019s not often that you get a Bernie Madoff situation \u2014 a top three fraud of all time \u2014 occurring. People panicked and generally took the FTX situation out of perspective for what it was; the exceptional greed and immoral activities of one man, SBF.\n\nA lot of work has to be done in our industry as it scales; the SBF saga was a sad and unnecessary development but should not be taken out of context.\n\nWe are in a young burgeoning industry that is moving at lightning pace, and things tend to get broken along the way as we scale. Just like all new industries before it, and any tech startup stock price, it\u2019s a rollercoaster ride. We can\u2019t expect Bitcoin and crypto to take over the world of finance in a smooth straight line; volatility happens in price, and it also happens in broader operations with scale. Best practices take time to be learned in a new industry, and regulation takes even longer to catch up.\n\nA lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) has been spread across the industry regarding various other platforms. In late 2022 this caused a bank run on most exchanges which was unwarranted and ultimately not an issue for these platforms which had full backing. Exchange risk can be monitored in real-time using on-chain data and this is one of the reasons Capriole saw the FTX collapse coming and avoided it. There simply were not anywhere near the same levels of obvious risk on other crypto platforms in late 2022.\n\nNonetheless, it is so important to prioritize risk management in everything you do in the crypto space. Risk management must come above all else. Distribution of assets across trusted sources is important. Learning about self-custody is important. Security is important. On-chain monitoring and reporting is important. If you can\u2019t actively manage risk in this 24/7 industry, then there are professional, regulated hedge fund structures that can do that for you. Be sure to always do your due diligence in crypto.\n\nCT: Did the FTX episode strengthen or weaken Bitcoin or specific altcoins, if any?\n\nCE: The FTX episode weakened the institutional reputation of Bitcoin and crypto. Many institutions were burned. Large U.S. pension funds also lost money on FTX. It takes a long time for these types of entities to get into a new asset class like Bitcoin and crypto, and an event like this caused them to pull the hand brake on their investment activities as they wait for the seas to calm and regulators to respond.\n\nIt is a shame that it has temporarily slowed the movements of these larger players, which rely on quarterly board meetings to make such big decisions \u2014 but it is a great opportunity for the smaller investors and the more innovative and agile family offices.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the FTX collapse, incredibly rare value was opened up for long-term investments in Bitcoin in particular.\u201d\n\nFor anyone with a multiyear investment horizon, $16,000 should represent a great opportunity to allocate to this asset class based on the on-chain data we analyze. At Capriole, we were particularly excited by this, and doubled our own investment in our fund during this period. For the reasons noted above, $16\u201320,000 was a one-in-four-year valuation opportunity for Bitcoin, an incredibly rare opportunity to allocate into this asset class at great discounts across most on-chain valuation metrics.\n\nThe FTX collapse cleansed the market of leverage, bad actors, and an array of entities with poor risk management and operations. The market now has a clean slate to start the new halving cycle fresh and ready for organic growth. The institutions will come back; it\u2019s only a matter of time when an industry is 10Xing its number of users every three years. We are seeing a strong uptick in savvy investors taking advantage of today\u2019s opportunity.\n\nCT: What kind of impact will a ban of crypto staking service providers have on Bitcoin and Ethereum price?\n\nCE: It\u2019s hard to say for sure and would depend on the extent of any ban. If there is a major sweeping regulatory action against staking, there will be a short-term price impact. But this fear, like most in crypto, is overweighted. There may be some regulations or restrictions in the area, but I expect the long-term impact will be negligible.\n\nLikely there will be more requirements on staking entities, including regulator data sharing, which in the short-term could reduce market size, but in the mid to long term this just moves the decision to stake to the individual user for that platform.\n\nAs we saw with the China ban on Bitcoin mining in 2021, Bitcoin (and crypto) is too big now for any one country to stop adoption. Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate recovered from a 50% collapse in just one year. A staking ban would be harder to implement, would likely be less severe and much less impactful than the China ban.\n\nCT: What\u2019s the possibility of this happening? Do you expect a general crackdown on crypto on-ramps on the horizon?\n\nCE: Exchanges are under the microscope. There will be more regulation and more reporting and communication requirements for exchanges globally. Many small exchanges won\u2019t be able to meet these requirements and it will further consolidate the industry.\n\n\u201cI expect all of the large players will ultimately comply.\u201c\n\nIn November 2022, we saw how every major exchange implemented proof-of-reserves using on-chain data to verify Bitcoin holdings of customer assets in a matter of weeks. Sure, there are limitations in this reporting, but for so much of the industry to implement that globally and so fast shows just how quickly this industry moves, how most of us are here to do good and do the right thing. More needs to be done, and it will be. It\u2019s just a matter of time and it\u2019s part of the natural growth and adoption of an exponential age industry.\n\nCT: What are the biggest dangers to Bitcoin\u2019s potential bull cycle?\n\nCE: The most obvious risk is if interest rates rise further, and substantially more, than expected. That would squeeze the relative value of Bitcoin. Assuming all else equal, higher interest rates increase the relative value of the dollar to a long-term investor, and arguably lessen the value of hard assets like gold and Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, we have been predicting for some time that rate rises will stop in 2023, and the broader market is pricing this in today too. The Fed is also now signaling to the market that the top for interest rates is in this year. The significant decline in inflation we are currently seeing has also historically marked the top for interest rates.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin eyes 25% of world\u2019s wealth in new $10M BTC price prediction\n\nGiven we are late in the economic cycle, unemployment is at multi-decade lows and debt-to-GDP is extraordinarily high; it simply isn\u2019t sustainable to keep interest rates at aggressively high levels today.\n\nAll of this skews the probability toward policy easing to support economic growth. Which means Bitcoin is positioned to be the perfect investment against easing a world with high debt and inflation. Much like the 1970s, but even more so today.\n\nCT: What are the biggest tailwinds for Bitcoin\u2019s potential bull cycle?\n\nCE: In 2024, Bitcoin will become the hardest asset in the world with certainty. The inflation rate of Bitcoin will drop to half that of gold, overtaking gold as the best store of value. Not to mention the improved portability, speed and fungibility of Bitcoin in a digital world.\n\n\u201cEvery Bitcoin halving drives a narrative shift and heightened adoption curve for Bitcoin, and the 2024 cycle is probably the most important halving we will ever see. A transition point.\u201c\n\nIt is worth mentioning that none of the prior halvings have ever been priced in, so I am expecting multi-hundred-percent returns to continue here as well.\n\nFurther, this decade we are entering the period where most technology adoption \u201cs-curves\u201d go vertical. That is, it takes roughly 10 years for new technologies to go from 0\u201310% adoption (where Bitcoin is today) and then another 10 years to go to full adoption.\n\nGiven Bitcoin usage is growing faster than the internet did in the late 90s, all signs point to the next decade being incredible for Bitcoin. The global macroeconomic backdrop also looks set to only support that adoption curve.\n\nCT: What are your favorite metrics to keep an eye on right now to anticipate the next market move?\n\nCE: Predicting short-term moves is a full-time job; we approach that with fully automated quant strategies at Capriole. For investors looking to allocate for multi-year periods, the best bet is to try and allocate at or near cyclical lows and reduce some exposure at cyclical highs.\n\nBitcoin still very much operates on a four-year cycle, driven by the four-year halvings. Therefore, you usually get roughly 12 months of great value to allocate into the market and 6\u201312 months to reduce risk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about timing exact bottoms and tops \u2014 unless you are monitoring the market full time, don\u2019t bother!\u201d\n\nWhen you get a confluence of multiple long-term metrics, only metrics that have proven themselves to be reliable through years of usage (without modification), that is, when you have something useful to act on. Some I like are:\n\nHash ribbons (recently signaled a buy at $20K)\n\nNVT\n\nMarket value to realized value (MVRV)\n\nBitcoin production cost and electrical cost\n\nBitcoin energy value\n\nSLRV ribbons\n\nDormancy flow\n\nHold waves\n\nNet unrealized profit and loss (NUPL)\n\nYou can read more about each here.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) recent price rally from $16,500 to $25,000 can be attributed to a short squeeze in the futures market and recent macroeconomic improvements. However, while prices increased, data suggests many interested buyers (including whales) were left on the sidelines.\n\nThe recent rally to $25,000 shared many similarities with the 2019 bear market rally, which saw a 330% surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price to highs around $14,000 from the November 2019 low of $3,250. The BTC/USD pair recently rose 60% from its November 2022 low.\n\nOn-chain and market indicators relative to the 2019 rally send mixed signals on whether or not Bitcoin\u2019s rally will continue. Nevertheless, there are strong reasons to believe that the market has reached a crucial turning point where it can either turn into a full-fledged bull market or slump back into a long-term bear trend.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the top five indicators to understand the current price dynamic relative to the 2019 bull run.\n\nBitcoin tackles historical trading levels\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price surpassed the 200-day moving average (MA) at $19,600, which could encourage paper traders looking to open a long position. Historically, this metric has acted as a bull-bear pivot line, with breakouts above it being bullish and vice versa.\n\nBTC/USD usually retests the 200-day MA on a breakout, which raises the possibility of a correction toward $19,500. However, this was not the case in 2019, when the price continued rising without a pullback to the 200-day MA.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart with 200-day MA metric. Source: TradingView\n\nAt the same time, traders are likely paying attention to the 200-week moving average at $25,100. Bitcoin price had never dropped below the 200-week MA until November 2022, and reclaiming this level could encourage technical buyers to join the bandwagon.\n\nHowever, until a breakout happens, traders might continue to stay on the sidelines. The funding rates for perpetual swap contracts are currently neutral, suggesting that traders are waiting for confirmation.\n\nCrypto Twitter trader, Immortal, found the market is only at the \u201chalfway point\u201d considering the duration of the current rally compared to the one in 2019. The 2019 rally lasted 193 days from bottom to top, while only 92 days have passed since the bottom on Nov. 9, 2023.\n\nComparing the time from the bottom to local top in 2019 and 2023. Source: Twitter\n\nImmortal says that if the 2019 timeline fractal holds true in 2023, BTC/USD could surge as high as $46,000 by March.\n\nA stablecoin supply ratio oscillator is close to the 2019 top\n\nBitcoin\u2019s stablecoin supply ratio (SSR) oscillator gauges the market\u2019s buying power. The indicator measures the ratio between Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization and stablecoin supply. Low readings on the SSR oscillator indicate higher purchasing power of stablecoins. Conversely, a spike in the metric indicates overbought conditions.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price surge in February 2023 saw the SSR oscillator spike toward levels not seen since 2019 and 2021. The indicator suggests that the positive trend might end soon. There is a slight chance of one last push higher toward the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nHowever, the data could be taken with a grain of salt because of the regulatory crackdown on the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin, which caused a significant decline in supply. It might have skewed the SSR oscillator to show overbought conditions.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s stablecoin supply ratio (SSR) oscillator. Source: Glassnode\n\nOne of the biggest concerns of the current surge is the absence of whale buying. Contrary to 2019, the whales have sold in the present rally. The divergence between the number of whales and the price raises concerns about the sustainability of the positive trend.\n\nNumber of BTC addresses with balance more than or equal to 1,000. Source: Glassnode\n\nData highlights a crucial bull-bear pivotal point\n\nInvestors add to their winning positions on pullbacks in an uptrend, indicated when the spent output profit ratio (SOPR) indicator stays above one. The opposite happens in a downtrend where bears dominate the market by selling into rallies. A crossover of the metric above one is a potential trend reversal signal.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s 7-day moving average of the adjusted SOPR indicator shows that the bear trend has likely reversed. The indicator turned bullish when BTC broke out above $20,800 in January 2023. The metric retested the pivotal support level with Bitcoin\u2019s price at $21,800, making it a crucial support level for a sustained uptrend.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin faces do-or-die weekly, monthly close with macro bull trend at stake\n\n7-day MA of Bitcoin\u2019s adjusted SOPR indicator. Source: Glassnode\n\nSimilarly, the price has moved above the average buying levels of both short and long-term holders, which is another signal of a potential trend reversal. This could indicate that the market has reached a crucial turning point as the on-chain oscillators return to equilibrium.\n\nThe metrics also hint that a potential bull trend appears likely while the price holds above support at $21,800, $20,800 and $19,600.\n\nA weekly close above $25,100 could encourage derivatives and technical traders to buy into the current rally, but there are some warning signs that the market might be reaching overheated conditions and a quick correction toward lower support levels cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Over the past few months, a chorus of some of the world\u2019s most powerful businessmen has been determined to scare the financial system into believing that crypto is dangerous. Jamie Dimon said, \u201cBitcoin itself is a hyped up fraud.\u201d Jane Fraser opined, \u201cIf grandma is investing in crypto, we better have protections in place.\u201d And Charlie Munger described it as \u201ca gambling contract with a nearly 100% edge for the house.\u201d\n\nThe loudest critics of the new asset class all seem to have one thing in common\u2013they\u2019re some of the biggest winners of the legacy financial system, and arguably have the most to lose if cryptocurrency becomes the norm.\n\nIf a record-holding athlete campaigns for a change in the rules that happens to make it harder for others to break that record\u2014then we\u2019d question their motives. It\u2019s time to hold the affluent figures who oppose crypto to the same standard. At the same time, there are a number of myths that they keep trying to advance, which don\u2019t hold up against the evidence.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Charlie Munger, who is calling for America to follow China\u2019s example and ban crypto. Munger is a billionaire whose wealth derives almost entirely from his shares in Berkshire Hathaway, itself a sophisticated investment vehicle. He and his business partner Warren Buffett (who said Bitcoin is \u201cprobably rat poison squared\u201d) are the archetype of wealth created by America\u2019s free and open capital markets.\n\nMunger, Dimon, and Fraser are beneficiaries of a system that relies on too-big-to-fail intermediaries like J.P. Morgan, run by Dimon, or Bank of America, a major Berkshire holding. That these intermediaries require government intervention once a decade is not considered controversial. Now, Munger wants America to suppress an entire asset class.\n\nCryptocurrencies are different. Users don\u2019t need intermediaries to transact. In over a decade of operation, the Bitcoin system has never been down or needed a bailout. Unlike some of traditional finance\u2019s biggest names, it has never made a mistake or defrauded millions of its own customers.\n\nIn his column, Munger compares crypto to a bet that\u2019s guaranteed to lose, but Bitcoin has mostly appreciated over the years, as have other blue-chip coins. Long-term holders tolerate the volatility because it usually resolves to the upside. Other asset classes have also done well during the lifespan of crypto, but investments like real estate, fine art, and startup equity are not accessible to the general public. Even Berkshire Hathaway stock is only ownable by a select few given its high price.\n\nAnyone can own crypto in small amounts\u2013and hundreds of millions of people all over the world do. Adoption is highest in places like Vietnam, Pakistan, and Nigeria, countries where the banking system is unreliable and the local currency inflationary. If your domestic currency is collapsing, then all a cryptocurrency needs to do is bounce around and you still benefit. Despite the overall decline in crypto prices in the past year, Bitcoin has still appreciated against the Argentine peso. Cryptocurrencies use technology to create property rights where they don\u2019t exist.\n\nTo be fair, Omaha\u2013where Berkshire Hathaway is headquartered\u2013does not have these problems. But even in the U.S., crypto per capita adoption is highest with minorities. Maybe these communities still remember the discriminatory banking practices of the past or the lack of services in the present. According to official estimates, 40% of Black households in America remain unbanked or underbanked. That\u2019s real rat poison\u2013but don\u2019t expect any op-eds from captains of industry proposing a solution. It\u2019s Dogecoin that keeps them up at night.\n\nYes, there are scams and collapses in the crypto ecosystem, and it needs sensible regulation. But there are scams and collapses in every industry, particularly early on. Tellingly, no reasonable person ever proposes banning them. Imagine if we had banned tech stocks after the dot-com bubble, or bank stocks after the 2008 crisis.\n\nMunger says that \u201ca cryptocurrency is not a currency, not a commodity, and not a security\u201d\u2013as if this proclamation proves something. If semantics were the basis for value, then English majors would be running Wall Street. Google was not a telephone company, not a postal service, and not a TV station when it first launched. Gmail and YouTube still took over.\n\nThings change, industries get disrupted and new asset classes arise. The sausage-making of building a new financial system is not pretty\u2013but it\u2019s a necessary condition of building something better. The billionaire bankers calling for the end of crypto shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. If anything, their over-the-top opposition proves the kids are onto something.\n\nOmid Malekan is an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and the author of Re-Architecting Trust, the Curse of History and the Crypto Cure for Money, Markets and Platforms.\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) can hit $10 million per coin or more as it eats 25% of the global wealth, new analysis has concluded.\n\nIn a blog post released on Feb. 16, fund manager and Bitcoin expert advisor Jesse Myers revealed his own \u201coutrageous\u201d BTC price target.\n\nMyers: \u201cBitcoin could 500x over the coming decades\u201d\n\nBitcoin may struggle with \u201cbrutal\u201d volatility, but hodlers and critics alike should be in no doubt about its long-term price trajectory, Myers said.\n\nAnalyzing Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition, he argues that Bitcoin\u2019s ability to appreciate over time means that it is all but destined to suck in value from other asset classes.\n\nAmong other reasons, this is because an asset with such appreciation characteristics and increasing scarcity allows it to fulfill the role of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin has an unthinkable property: it gets more valuable over time. Gold is good at storing purchasing power, but Bitcoin grows purchasing power,\u201d the blog post reads.\n\n\u201cValue stored in Bitcoin becomes worth more over time because of Bitcoin\u2019s design of increasing scarcity \u2014 you just have to outlast the (admittedly brutal) volatility along the way.\u201d\n\nSuch an idea is not new \u2014 it forms the core thesis of many popular takes on Bitcoin, among them Saifedean Ammous\u2019 seminal book, The Bitcoin Standard.\n\nGetting down to the numbers, meanwhile, Myers calculated the global allocation into BTC as 0.05% of available wealth as of 2023 \u2014 $400 billion.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 1/2000th of global asset value,\u201d the post continues.\n\n\u201cWith that in mind, we have to ask ourselves an important question: when Bitcoin\u2019s mechanics continue to play out (causing it to continue appreciating reliably in value every 4 years), will more than 0.05% of the world\u2019s capital eventually realize it wants to be in an asset like that? I think the only logical conclusion is \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat realization, Myers forecasts, means that $10 million per Bitcoin should be a \u201cconservative estimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall, my personal assessment of where the ceiling is for Bitcoin is simple\u2026 it\u2019s very high. Almost to the point that I\u2019m embarrassed to show my analysis,\u201d he concludes.\n\n\u201cMy conservative estimates suggest an outrageous full potential for Bitcoin\u2019s price: $10m/Bitcoin, in today\u2019s dollars. To put this another way, I believe Bitcoin\u2019s full potential is to eat ~25% of the world\u2019s value\u2026 while today it constitutes just 0.05%. That\u2019s absurd. That means that I believe Bitcoin could 500x over the coming decades, in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.\u201d\n\nMacro asset comparison graphic (screenshot). Source: Jesse Myers/Substack\n\nARK Bitcoin \u201cbear case\u201d now $258,000 by 2030\n\n\u201cAbsurd\u201d or not, Myers is far from alone in eyeing sky-high Bitcoin price valuations coming true in the coming decades.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin must leverage $1T central bank liquidity to beat sellers \u2014 Research\n\nSome are even calling for the $1-million mark to hit before the end of this one \u2014 ARK Invest, for example, continued to stick by that very prediction throughout the 2022 bear market declines.\n\nIn its \u201cBig Ideas 2023\u201d outlook released at the end of January, the investment giant described long-term opportunity as \u201cstrengthening.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s \u201cbear case\u201d for 2030, it revealed, still puts BTC/USD at $258,000 by the end of the decade.\n\nBitcoin growth forecast data (screenshot).

        "content": "Pics A Massachusetts man accused of using his job as a city's assistant facilities director to hide a cryptocurrency mining operation in the crawlspace of a school has surrendered himself to authorities on Friday morning after skipping his Thursday arraignment.\n\nA judge issued a default warrant for Nadeam Nahas' arrest yesterday on charges of fraudulent use of electricity and vandalizing a school, in relation with the cryptomining operation discovered under Cohasset Middle/High School in December, 2021. Nahas surrendered to authorities with his attorney this morning, the Norfolk District Attorney's office told The Register.\n\nBitcoin mining computers seized by Cohasset Police from the school\n\nThe mining setup was discovered by Nahas' boss when conducting a routine inspection of the school two years ago, Cohasset Police Chief William Quigley told us.\n\nThe director \"noticed electrical wires, temporary duct work, and numerous computers that seemed out of place. After researching and contacting the town IT director, it was learned that this was a cryptocurrency mining operation which was unlawfully attached to the school electrical system,\" Quigley said.\n\nThe crypto mining setup under a Massachusetts school\n\nCohasset police asked the US Coast Guard Investigative Services and Department of Homeland Security remove the machines safely and determine where they came from. After three months of investigation, and Nahas himself allegedly checking out the machines and denying he knew what they were, Cohasset detectives found probable cause to charge him of the aforementioned crimes. He resigned his position with the town in early 2022.\n\nDuctwork used as part of an illegal cryptocurrency mining operation discovered under a Massachusetts school\n\nAccording to Boston news station WCVB, Nahas is said to have operated his underground crypto mine for eight months before being discovered in December, racking up approximately $17,492 (\u00a314,644) in electricity on the district's dime.\n\nStrike where the power's cheap - or just steal it\n\nBitcoin mining requires a lot of power and a recent claimed it uses as much electricity as nation states like The Philippines.\n\nThat said, mining Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies can be profitable if you do it in a state where energy is cheap. Massachusetts is decidedly not one of those states, according to a 2021 map of average US retail electrical prices.\n\nElectricity prices as of January 2023 show the New England region and Boston, Massachusetts, specifically, to still be considerably higher than the national average.\n\nAfter entering a plea of not guilty, Nahas was released on the condition the he stay away from all public buildings in the town, as requested by Norfolk assistant DA Mark Assad, his office told us.\n\nNahas is due back in court in May for pretrial hearings. If convicted, he faces up to two years in prison. \u00ae"

        "title": "The two sides of crypto in Ukraine war - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT\u2019s Cryptofinance newsletter. One year on from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, we\u2019re looking at the role crypto has played in the conflict\n\nCrypto\u2019s impact on geopolitical issues does not often make for uplifting reading. The US, for example, fears digital assets can offer actors under sanctions a fresh means of skirting the financial system.\n\nBut the war in Ukraine has showed that the use of crypto in international affairs is far more nuanced and complicated. Blockchain data analytics company Elliptic shared data with the FT showing private crypto fundraising for pro-Ukrainian causes has outpaced Russian equivalents by a rate of 44 to one in the last year.\n\nIn total, more than $200mn worth of crypto has made its way to what have been described as pro-Ukraine causes. Over $80mn worth of these funds was sent directly to the Ukrainian government.\n\nJust weeks after the invasion, a Ukrainian politician said crypto had helped supply its armed forces with supplies including bulletproof vests, helmets and walkie talkies. Other funds turned to humanitarian causes, and even journalism and intelligence efforts.\n\nNot only do these funds eclipse the less than $5mn sent to pro-Russian entities, it represents at least one-fifth of overall non-state-mandated aid to Ukraine, marking the first time in history crypto has played a significant role in a major conflict.\n\n\u201cUkraine bet big on crypto by offering donation addresses literally hours after the invasion, and it did pay off,\u201d said an Elliptic analyst who spoke to me on the condition of anonymity. \u201cTwenty per cent of grassroots funds coming from crypto is no small feat,\u201d they added.\n\nIf you have subscribed to this newsletter for some time, you\u2019ll recall only a few weeks ago I questioned crypto\u2019s utility as a force for good, as hard-to-spend crypto tokens poured into Turkey and Syria in the days after the region\u2019s tragic earthquake. But in Ukraine, crypto has shown to have some social utility.\n\nSo can crypto claim to be a force for legitimate good? Possibly but as crypto fans also say, the technology is neutral and can be used in a multitude of ways.\n\nOf the near-$5mn worth of crypto donated to pro-Russian entities, more than half of those funds were dedicated to military fundraising, and most originated from exchanges and mixing services \u2014 a particular slice of crypto technology to have raised the ire of western governments in recent months.\n\nThese groups often provide spending reports on messaging platform Telegram. Elliptic estimates that MOO \u201cVeche\u201d \u2014 a military fundraising group active in the Donbas \u2014 has received roughly $1.8mn in bitcoin, which would make it the wealthiest pro-Russian fundraising group by crypto holdings.\n\nA collection of supplies donated by MOO \u201cVeche\u201d \u00a9 Elliptic\n\nElliptic\u2019s research also highlights one \u201cparticularly brutal\u201d use for cryptocurrency that traces to Rusich, a paramilitary fighting group known for neo-Nazi symbolism. The organisation \u2014 also linked to the Wagner Group \u2014 has been involved in military campaigns in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nIn Rusich-affiliated Telegram channels, wallet addresses have been shared widely soliciting crypto donations. Those wallets have had sanctions imposed by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, but in addition the paramilitary group has tried to extort the families of lost loved ones by promising co-ordinates of their dead relatives in exchange for bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t identify the bodies of those killed, don\u2019t just give them away. Take the coordinates of the exact burial place . . . and offer relatives the details for $2,000 \u2014 $5,000. Money can be transferred to your bitcoin wallet.\u201d\n\nAnother caveat that might subdue crypto\u2019s evangelists is that while Ukrainian donations have far outpaced those of Russian fundraising, the pace of donations has slowed markedly.\n\nElliptic estimates that much of the $200mn-plus donated to Ukraine was sent in the immediate aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion. After March 2022, the rate of Ukrainian donations declined. In contrast, Russian crypto fundraising shows no signs of subsiding.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why a lot of virtual asset services can\u2019t afford to be complacent about this, because while Ukraine funds have fallen, Russia is much more stable in terms of funds flowing in,\u201d the Elliptic analyst added.\n\nBefore Christmas, one Ukrainian politician told me Russian use of crypto was set to become a \u201chuge issue\u201d. If Russian crypto fundraising doesn\u2019t slow down in the coming months, he might be right.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on crypto\u2019s role on a global scale? As always, send me your thoughts at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nWeekly highlights:\n\nThe Federal Reserve issued a joint statement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency highlighting liquidity risks to banks from some sources of funding in crypto markets. It is the latest slice of evidence that US agencies are leaning heavily on US banks to divorce themselves from crypto, a lesson some banks such as Silvergate have learned the hard way.\n\nLife got worse for Sam Bankman-Fried this week when US prosecutors widened their criminal case against the former FTX chief. Thursday\u2019s updated indictment added charges including securities fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bringing an already long charge sheet to 12. SBF\u2019s political donations also came under the spotlight, described as being \u201cmade in the names of others in order to obscure the true source of the money and evade federal election law\u201d.\n\nHong Kong put more detail on its plan to attract more crypto business into the territory by letting retail investors trade coins.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission issued a fresh bid to oppose Binance US\u2019s proposed $1bn acquisition of the assets belonging to Voyager Digital, the collapsed crypto lender from last summer. The SEC said the rescue package may violate securities law. I teamed up with my editor Philip Stafford for the story, which you can read here.\n\nSoundbite of the week: Crypto\u2019s lost battle\n\nAgust\u00edn Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements, said it was time for crypto to admit defeat over one of its deepest-held beliefs: that it is a viable medium of exchange that rivals fiat currencies.\n\n\u201cA few years ago crypto assets and cryptocurrencies were in a way put as an alternative to fiat money, I think that battle has been won, technology doesn\u2019t make for trusted money.\u201d\n\nMike Novogratz \u2014 a man who has a tattoo of failed stablecoin Luna \u2014 thought he would try to school the BIS head. Read his response here.\n\nMike Novogratz\u2019s Luna tattoo \u00a9 Mike Novogratz\n\nData mining: Tether\u2019s dominance grows\n\nTether\u2019s stablecoin has long been established as the largest on the crypto market, but scrutiny over its reserves and the growth of rival tokens undermined its dominance in recent months.\n\nNew York\u2019s recent action against BUSD \u2014 the third-biggest stablecoin and thus a chief Tether rival \u2014 has reshaped the market again.\n\nSince regulators in the state ordered Paxos to stop issuing fresh BUSD tokens, the Binance-branded coin has lost billions in market share.\n\nBy contrast Tether\u2019s USDT is now more than half of the market and has its highest share since October 2021, data provider CryptoCompare found."

        "content": "Switzerland has long been synonymous with financial innovation, and Lugano now joins the race to become a hub for blockchain technology development. Above all, the city seeks to give a powerful boost to the adoption of cryptoassets to buy goods and services. Lugano thus aims to become the acknowledged cryptocurrency capital of Europe.\n\nDemonstrating the city's commitment to fostering blockchain technology ideas and startups, Lugano's Plan \u20bf is designed to decentralize the bitcoin network and support sustainable cryptocurrency mining facilities in the region.\n\nTo make this vision a reality, attract talent and encourage networking and knowledge-sharing, the city will actively support R&D and relevant projects at its business hub. The goal is to extend the use of blockchain technology throughout the city to improve all aspects of residents\u2019 day-to-day lives. Announced a few months ago by the mayor of Lugano, Michele Foletti, the pilot program could be key to the ultimate success and further development of bitcoin, as it is the first credible attempt by a city to adopt a digital currency for regular use.\n\nSwitzerland is a country where blockchain technology and banking go hand in hand: the city of Zug is home to the Crypto Valley Association, an independent, government-backed body that seeks to leverage the country's strengths to develop a crypto and blockchain hub for businesses from around the world.\n\nUnlike other countries, where crypto efforts are largely controlled by a central bank, \u200b\u200bSwitzerland operates a system of 11 Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs). This helps ensure a state-of-the-art blockchain ecosystem shaped by clear, efficient and flexible regulation.\n\nGiven this operating framework, BBVA's Swiss unit can offer innovation, security and confidence to customers who would like to explore the world of investing in digital assets. Through its Zurich office, BBVA has added crypto, bitcoin and ethereum to its offering for international private banking customers.\n\nThe cryptocurrency trading and custody service has received several awards as early as this year: at Innovation & Insight Week 2022, Celent, the leading research and technology advisory firm for financial institutions, presented an award in the product and platform category to BBVA Switzerland for the launch of New Gen. The consulting firm emphasized the positive features of the crypto platform\u2019s wealth management model."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin dropped sharply on Friday\u2014dragging the rest of the digital asset market with it\u2014after key inflation data came in and seemingly rattled investors.\n\nThe biggest cryptocurrency is currently down 3% in 24 hours, trading for $23,070, CoinGecko data shows. Just last week, it broke above $25,000 per coin for the first time in eight months.\n\nMost other cryptocurrencies have also taken a hit: Ethereum has shed 3.1% in the past day, trading hands for $$1,593; Dogecoin is now priced at $0.082\u2014a 3.3% 24-hour drop.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCryptocurrency is following the U.S. equities market today as it typically does.

        "title": "Bitcoin retirement plans elicit caution from regulators - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Even as the crypto market continues to forge an impressive recovery from the 2022 bear market, the industry continues to attract the wrath of regulators worldwide, especially in the United States. Three U.S. financial watchdogs recently issued stern warnings to individuals looking to invest in retirement funds offering exposure to digital assets.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, the North American Securities Administrators Association and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) warned investors that individual retirement accounts (IRAs) that include cryptocurrencies could potentially be classified as \u201csecurities,\u201d unless they are registered with the SEC or have a valid exemption certificate.\n\nMoreover, in the past year, many policymakers have continued to aim at cryptocurrency investment vehicles, such as retirement accounts, citing the string of insolvencies witnessed last year. For example, New York Attorney General Letitia James has repeatedly called for a ban on all crypto-inclusive contribution plans and IRAs.\n\nRegulators are understandably cautious, with one Canadian teacher\u2019s pension fund, the Ontario Teacher\u2019s Pension Plan, taking a $95 million loss on its substantial stake in the FTX crypto exchange.\n\nHowever, some prominent crypto proponents in the U.S. Senate, like Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, believe that Bitcoin (BTC) should be a part of 401(k) retirement packages.\n\nAre crypto retirement funds a good idea?\n\nTo better understand whether including cryptocurrencies in pension funds makes investment sense, Cointelegraph reached out to Ilan Sterk, CEO of Altshuler Shaham Horizon \u2014 an Israeli cryptocurrency custody and trading provider \u2014 one of the few crypto firms in the country approved to deal with banks.\n\nAccording to Sterk, minimal exposure to digital assets can be a good fit for long-term retirement-centric investments. He added, \u201cFor pensioners, an investment portfolio can be allocated between various assets like securities, bonds, hedge funds, digital assets and private equity. Blockchain and digital assets are considered a relatively new field but with high utilization and a wide ecosystem, so allocating a conservative portion to such investments might be fruitful.\u201d\n\nRecent: SEC vs. Kraken: A one-off or opening salvo in an assault on crypto?\n\nThat said, he does agree with the warnings issued by the SEC and FINRA, especially since they pertain to retirement accounts containing the hard-earned savings of many people. Sterk said that crypto is a \u201cvery volatile investment for a retirement account\u201d and, therefore, people investing in such offerings should take the time to understand the inherent risks associated with digital assets. He added:\n\n\u201cI believe that regulators are crucial to organizing new investment fields like digital assets as well as for laying out clear guidelines, especially for pension accounts, so investors won\u2019t find themselves penniless upon reaching retirement.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, the Israeli Capital Market, Insurance and Savings Authority published similar guidelines for local institutions \u2014 including provident funds and pension funds \u2014 telling institutions that should they decide to invest in Bitcoin, they must detail and explain their decision to the regulatory body.\n\nExtreme volatility of crypto\n\nWade Wang, the founder and CEO of Safeheron \u2014 a digital asset self-custody provider that recently integrated its multi-party computation multisignature security solution with MetaMask \u2014 told Cointelegraph that it is \u201cnot recommended\u201d that retirement funds seeking long-term returns be exposed to cryptocurrencies, at least in the near future. He added:\n\n\u201cInvesting in digital assets comes with high uncertainty and severe volatility. So far, any coins or tokens within the crypto landscape are circulated within their own individual markets. The circulation between these different ecosystems, especially traditional ones like pension funds, requires considerably greater development.\u201d\n\nWang highlighted that crypto should not be viewed differently from other investment forms. As the industry matures and novel Web3 applications emerge, many traditional funds \u2014 including family offices and retirement funds \u2014 will continue to eye digital assets.\n\nZoomers wants crypto in their retirement funds\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by U.S. asset manager Charles Schwab during Q4 2022, almost 50% of zoomers and millennials want to see crypto become a part of their 401(k) retirement plans. Millennials were born in the early 1980s to mid-1990s, while zoomers were born in the mid to late 1990s and early 2010s.\n\nAnalysts for Charles Schwab found that 46% of zoomers and 45% of millennials would like to invest in cryptocurrencies as part of their retirement plans. Moreover, the survey found 43% of zoomers and 47% of millennials had already put a portion of their savings into digital assets outside their retirement plans.\n\nYounger investors want a wider range of investment choices, like cryptcurrencies. Source: Charles Schwab\n\nThese results lay in stark contrast to another survey conducted by the investment manager, which found that just 31% of Gen X\u2019ers and 11% of boomers \u2014 those born anywhere between the mid-1940s to late 1970s \u2014 were keen on investing in digital currencies through their 401(k) retirement plans.\n\nBill to remove roadblocks\n\nOn Feb. 15, Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville announced he would reintroduce the Financial Freedom Act to allow American 401(k) retirement plans to gain cryptocurrency exposure. The bill, first tabled in the Senate in May 2022, seeks to reverse a policy from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) directing the type of investments allowed in 401(k) plans, including crypto.\n\nIn Tuberville\u2019s words, the bill seeks to prevent the DOL from pursuing enforcement actions for individuals utilizing brokerage windows to invest in digital assets. \u201cThe federal government shouldn\u2019t choose winners and losers in the investment game. My bill ensures that everyone who earns a paycheck has the financial freedom to invest in their futures however they see fit,\u201d Tubernille added.\n\nThe bill\u2019s co-sponsors include several prominent pro-crypto senators, including Cynthia Lummis, Rick Scott and Mike Braun. In a December 2022 interview, Senator Lummis stated that despite the recent market meltdown, she is still quite comfortable with the idea of Americans incorporating Bitcoin into their pension funds.\n\nRecent: DeFi security: How trustless bridges can help protect users\n\nSimilarly, on Feb. 14, Florida Representative Byron Donalds said he wanted to table a bill similar to Tuberville\u2019s in the House of Representatives. Both Donalds and Tuberville are likely to face stiff resistance from members of the Democratic party, as Senator Elizabeth Warren has repeatedly expressed her concerns about crypto being included in 401(k) plans. Senator Roger Marshall also shares a similar stance.\n\nWhat lies ahead?\n\nSince the beginning of 2022, the DOL has warned pension fund owners about crypto, asking them to exercise extreme caution when dealing with cryptocurrencies, citing the risk of fraud, theft and loss of funds. Other regulators have also adopted similar stances across the globe. As crypto adoption grows, time will tell how legislators come to view this novel asset class, especially from a long-term investment perspective."

The Lightning Network is used to send small amounts of Bitcoin around, called satoshis or sats, often using a lightning wallet.\n\nBlue Wallet is a popular Lightning Network wallet with over 42 BTC ($1 million) liquidity. Its largest channel has a 4 BTC ($95,000) capacity, according to data from Amboss. BlueWallet is a popular lightning wallet, often recommended by well-known Bitcoiners.\n\nCalle continued, \u201cIt\u2019s important to realize that lndhub is a protocol that helps you connect wallets to accounts.

        "content": "It\u2019s possible that many people have already forgotten that Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price closed 2022 at $16,529 and the recent rebound and rejection at the $25,000 level could raise concern among certain investors. Bears are pushing back at the $25,000 level and there has been multiple failed attempts at the level between Feb. 16 and Feb. 21. Currently, it looks like the $23,500 resistance is continuing to gain strength with every retest.\n\nPinpointing the rationale behind Bitcoin\u2019s 45.5% year-to-date gain is not apparent, but part of it comes from the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s inability to curb inflation while raising interest rates to its highest level in 15 years. The unintended consequence is higher government debt repayments and this adds further pressure to the budget deficit.\n\nIt\u2019s virtually impossible to predict when the Fed will change its stance, but as the debt to gross domestic product ratio surpasses 128, it should not take longer than 18 months. At some point, the value of the U.S. dollar itself could become endangered due to extreme debt leverage.\n\nOn Feb. 23, the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a joint statement encouraging U.S. banks that rely on funding from the crypto sector to prevent liquidity runs by maintaining strong risk management practices. Regulators said the report was spurred by \u201crecent events\u201d in the industry due to increased volatility risks.\n\nLet's look at derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nBitcoin margined longs were used to defend the $24,000 level\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because it allows investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nFor example, one can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy (long) Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet against (short) the cryptocurrency. Unlike futures contracts, the balance between margin longs and shorts isn\u2019t always matched.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders' margin lending ratio increased between Feb. 21 and Feb. 23, signaling that professional traders added leverage long positions as Bitcoin price broke below $24,000.\n\nOne might argue that the excessive demand for bullish margin positioning seems a desperate move after the failed attempt to break the $25,000 resistance on Feb. 21. However, the unusually high stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio tends to normalize after traders deposit additional collateral after a few days.\n\nOptions traders are more confident with downside risks\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent rally has caused investors to become more risk-averse. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign whenever arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nThe indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put options premium is higher than risk call options.\n\nIn short, the skew metric will move above 10% if traders fear a Bitcoin price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 10% skew.\n\nRelated: IMF exec board endorses crypto policy framework, including no crypto as legal tender\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nNotice that the 25% delta skew shifted slightly negative since Feb. 18 after option traders became more confident and the $23,500 support strengthened. A skew reading at -5% denotes a balanced demand between bullish and bearish option instruments.\n\nDerivatives data paints an unusual combination of excessive margin demand for longs and a neutral risk assessment from options traders. Yet, there is nothing concerning about it as long as the stablecoin/BTC ratio returns to levels below 30 in the coming days.\n\nConsidering regulators have been applying enormous pressure on the crypto sector, Bitcoin derivatives are holding up nicely. For example, on Feb. 22, the Bank for International Settlements general manager Agust\u00edn Carstens emphasized the need for regulation and risk management in the crypto space. The limited impact of the BIS statement on the price is a bullish sign and it possibly increases the odds of Bitcoin price breaking above $25,000 in the short-term.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe price of bitcoin is up roughly 50 per cent since the start of the year, despite the US government signalling a tougher regulatory stance on cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin briefly hit $25,000 this week, having started 2023 below $16,600, taking it back to levels not seen since last August. Other cryptocurrencies have also seen a significant surge in recent days, adding more than $100 billion to the overall market.\n\nThe price recovery surprised some analysts, as it went against an established narrative among several economic experts that bitcoin\u2019s market movements are largely driven by external macroeconomic and monetary news.\n\nSome credited the price surge to reports in China that the country is planning to soften its stance on crypto, having launched a major crackdown against the industry in 2021.\n\nA new study, however, suggests that neither news from China nor the US would have a significant impact on bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nA report from the New York Federal Reserve found that bitcoin\u2019s reaction to this and any other macroeconomic or monetary news will likely be \u201corthogonal\u201d movement.\n\n\u201cUnlike other US asset classes, bitcoin is orthogonal to monetary and macroeconomic news,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe study used a comprehensive intraday dataset to analyse the effects of the news on the price of bitcoin, which the authors had originally posited was an asset \u201cwith no intrinsic value\u201d for which its current price depends on the discounted value of its future price.\n\n\u201cThe result that bitcoin does not react to monetary news is puzzling as it casts some doubts on the role of discount rates in pricing bitcoin,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nCrypto market correlation with traditional markets was often cited by analysts in 2022 as a way of explaining or predicting bitcoin\u2019s price movements, though the study calls into question such methods of analysis.\n\nSimon Peters, a crypto market analyst at the online trading platform eToro, said the findings could support previous theories that bitcoin acts more like a form of \u2018digital gold\u2019 and a safe-haven asset during times of broader economic turmoil.\n\n\u201cThe report stands in contrast to most mainstream thinking around bitcoin at the moment, where markets did indeed seem to correlate more heavily last year \u2013 although this year that correlation has been less apparent,\u201d Mr Peters said.\n\n\u201cHowever, if bitcoin does indeed move differently to macroeconomic events then it could provide significant support for using it as a hedge against other markets \u2013 akin to gold.\u201d"

ERC 721 is a standard which outlines how an NFT should be created so that it will be properly recognized across the Ethereum ecosystem. When an ERC-721 NFT is created, a file of metadata \u2013 literally data which provides information about other data (hence, \u201cmeta\u201d) \u2013 provides information about the NFT. The easiest way to think of it is that the NFT itself is a contract that proves ownership of another item, which is detailed in that metadata. In the case of the most common NFTs, which are digital art, the actual JPG or file of the art is usually stored off the Ethereum blockchain and the metadata includes a link to that file.

However, some analysts argue that not only was this downturn expected, it also illustrates Bitcoin\u2019s continuing potential.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s meltdown in 2022 was influenced by the cryptocurrency\u2019s four-year halving cycle that tends to bring up a period of massive drawdowns.

        "title": "How to Read Crypto Financial Statements - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "Summary: I talk about the mental game of investing, particularly as it applies to crypto markets. Subscribe here and follow me to get weekly updates.\n\nThis week, Token Terminal released one of the greatest crypto products I\u2019ve seen in years: crypto financial statements. (See them here.)\n\nThe idea of creating crypto financial statements may have started with James Wang, who created one for Ethereum in Q1 2021. It was a clever concept: public companies are required to disclose their quarterly financials; why not do the same thing for crypto \u201ccompanies\u201d?\n\nSince blockchain technology is transparent, these financial statements would be much better than those of traditional companies. They wouldn\u2019t be prepared by an in-house financial team, shrouded in secrecy, and released weeks later. They would be available to anyone, instantly.\n\nNow, Token Terminal has taken this one better: they\u2019ve automated them.\n\nThe SEC, which prides itself on requiring clear and transparent financial information for investors, should be praising this latest development. This is so much better than the way it\u2019s done with public companies.\n\nI\u2019ve been geeking out over these reports all week. As a long-term crypto investor, these financial statements are like a secret weapon. It cuts through the hype and the headlines, and gives you the cold, hard facts about any crypto project they have listed (currently about 150).\n\nThe best part? The product is completely free.\n\nToday I\u2019ll show you how to read crypto financial statements, and some of the quick numbers you can pull to see whether a crypto investment might be worth your hard-earned money.\n\nUnderstanding the Income Statement\n\nFirst, a caveat: Token Terminal needs to work on their token terminology.\n\nIf you\u2019re used to reading traditional income statements, you\u2019ll have to wrap your head around these confusing names, so I\u2019ll break them down.\n\nWhat they call \u201cfees\u201d is like a traditional company\u2019s \u201crevenue.\u201d As every crypto investor knows, you have to pay fees to use crypto products. These fees are the money the crypto company takes in \u2013 like revenues of a traditional company.\n\n\u201cSupply-side fees\u201d are the share of these fees that go to the miners or validators: the ones who maintain the network. In a traditional company, this might be like your salaries paid to employees, or what you pay to make the product (also known as Cost of Goods Sold, or COGS).\n\nWhat they call \u201cRevenue\u201d is transaction fees that are paid to token holders, or (in some cases) tokens that are burned. Think of this more like \u201cdividends\u201d and \u201cstock buybacks\u201d: it\u2019s revenue that\u2019s benefiting the \u201cshareholders\u201d or \u201cowners\u201d (i.e., those who hold the token).\n\n\u201cToken incentives\u201d are \u201cextra rewards\u201d paid to users to get them to use the product. Compound, for example, pays COMP tokens to lenders and borrowers. This encourages usage of the product, but continually dilutes the value of COMP for everyone else. This is a useful metric, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a public-company equivalent: it would be like if Uber paid stock to get you to use their product in the early days. (More info here.)\n\nFinally, what they call \u201cEarnings\u201d are the aforementioned \u201cRevenue\u201d minus \u201cToken incentives.\u201d (Or value that accrues to shareholders, minus value that is taken away.) Earnings is incredibly valuable, even if it\u2019s confusingly-named, because it tells you whether owners/shareholders are gaining value or losing it.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick reference guide:\n\nTerm What it is Public-company equivalent Fees Money taken in from users of the product Revenue Supply-side fees Fees that go to miners or validators Salaries, COGS Revenue Value that is passed to token holders (fee-sharing or token burning) Dividends, stock buybacks Token incentives Free tokens given to users for using the product Discounts, rebates (but paid by issuing new shares) Earnings Token incentives minus earnings Share dilution (or buyback)\n\nLet\u2019s take a few real-life examples, and the \u201cstory\u201d that you can tell from each. To tell the story, we read the statements from right to left, or past to present.\n\nBitcoin Income Statement\n\nThe story: Fewer people are using the bitcoin network over the last few quarters ($30 million to $16.67 million in fees), which is not surprising given what we know about the current market.\n\nCalling the bottom line \u201cEarnings\u201d looks like the bitcoin company is losing money every quarter, which isn\u2019t really accurate, but it does highlight an important point: all bitcoin fees are going to miners, and none to the owners (or BTC investors).\n\nIn these reports, negative Earnings are not necessarily bad. They just mean you (the owner/shareholder) are not getting additional value, on top of the value of your underlying BTC.\n\nAs an analogy, some traditional investors only want to buy companies that pay dividends. Others don\u2019t care about regular payments, as long as the company has good long-term growth prospects. Bitcoin would appeal to the second type of investor.\n\nEthereum Income Statement\n\nThe story: A much better financial picture. Not only are fees (think: revenues) holding up, but earnings (think: the value of your investment) is going from negative to positive. This is a positive trend for ETH investors.\n\nUniswap Income Statement\n\nWe have a new metric here, which is the confusingly-named GMV, or \u201cGross Merchandise Volume.\u201d While this sounds like something a clothing manufacturer would measure, GMV is really just how much money they are moving. On a decentralized exchange like Uniswap, it\u2019s their trading volume. With a lending company like Compound, it\u2019s the value of active loans.\n\nThe story: Total trading volume is down about half from two quarters ago \u2013 again, not a surprise in the current market. All the fees earned by Uniswap go to the liquidity providers (you can read more about LPs in our Investor\u2019s Guide to Uniswap). As with bitcoin, UNI investors are betting on the company (i.e., that UNI price will rise), not on any payments to shareholders.\n\nUnderstanding the Treasury\n\nForward-thinking crypto companies keep a \u201cTreasury\u201d \u2013 a bit like \u201cretained earnings\u201d for traditional companies \u2013 that can be used to grow the business.\n\nYou might use Treasury to create new developer incentives, fund related startups, pay executives, or anything else that might cost real money. (Even though it\u2019s held in tokens, it can be converted into cash.) Communities usually vote on where to spend Treasury.\n\nTerm What it is Public-company equivalent Treasury Funds set aside to grow the business Retained earnings\n\nHere\u2019s a look at Compound\u2019s Treasury:\n\n\n\nThe story: When you see the Treasury slipping from $442 to $126 million (bottom row, right to left), you may think they are spending a boatload on what is clearly a declining business (top row, right to left).\n\nHowever, everything is affected by the macro market: when crypto is down, the demand for loans is down. The same goes for the value of their Treasury: since it\u2019s likely held in COMP tokens, the value of the token affects the value of the Treasury. Not a great financial picture, but more investigation is needed.\n\nWhich brings us to\u2026\n\nUnderstanding Market Data\n\nYou\u2019re already familiar with \u201cPrice\u201d: unfortunately, it\u2019s the only metric most crypto investors use. (That\u2019s why these reports are your secret weapon.)\n\nThey give you two market cap metrics, and the difference is how many tokens have been minted vs. how many have been promised:\n\n\u201c Fully Diluted Market Cap\u201d is the total value of the crypto company when all tokens are minted , according to their promised rules;\n\n, according to their promised rules; \u201cCirculating Market Cap\u201d is the total value of all the tokens in circulation today.\n\n\u201cTrading Volume\u201d shows you the value of tokens traded during the quarter, and \u201cTokenholders\u201d tells you how many individual wallets hold the token (imperfect number, since people can hold more than one wallet, but probably close enough).\n\nHere\u2019s the Market Data for Balancer (BAL):\n\nThe story: Bucking market trends, the price of BAL has actually increased over the last few quarters, as have the number of BAL tokenholders. There are roughly $250 million in tokens issued, out of $615 million that can eventually be minted.\n\nLooking at the total picture, we can see that even though trading volume (top line) has declined with the overall market, and earnings (think: shareholder value) are in the red, the price of BAL keeps going up. This is a red flag: why are investors so optimistic? (This may be the answer.)\n\nUnderstanding Valuation Multiples\n\nIn the traditional world, a valuation multiple is a ratio of one financial metric to another. They\u2019re useful for comparing very different companies, apples to apples.\n\nThese reports list four valuation multiples:\n\nP/F ratio (fully diluted) : Fully diluted market cap / annualized fees.\n\n: Fully diluted market cap / annualized fees. P/F ratio (circulating) : Circulating market cap / annualized fees.\n\n: Circulating market cap / annualized fees. P/S ratio (fully diluted) : Fully diluted market cap / annualized revenue.\n\n: Fully diluted market cap / annualized revenue. P/S ratio (circulating): Circulating market cap / annualized revenue.\n\nThe most helpful here is probably P/F ratio (circulating), which gives you the total value of all tokens, divided by the fees (or revenue) generated. Think of this like P/E ratio in traditional investing.\n\n(You\u2019re probably wondering why they chose the letter \u201cP.\u201d It stands for \u201cPrice\u201d in traditional Price-to-Earnings ratios. Super-confusing names, but great idea.)\n\nTerm What it is Public-company equivalent P/F ratio (circulating) Total value of all tokens, divided by fees (revenue) P/E ratio\n\nThe rule of thumb is that stocks with higher P/E ratios are more overvalued, while those lower P/E ratios are more undervalued. As a value investor, we hope to buy good companies with lower P/E ratios: these are the \u201chidden gems.\u201d\n\nHere are the valuation multiples for Lido (LDO):\n\nThe story: We can see healthy financials, with a growing number of assets staked (top line), a growing Treasury, and a steadily increasing price.\n\nThe P/F ratio (circulating) has increased from 3.6x to 4.8x, showing you that LDO is not quite the deal it was back when we issued our BUY ALERT in July. But it is still remarkably low compared to many other crypto projects (Ethereum, for example, is selling at a 150x P/F ratio). Still might be a great buy.\n\nUnderstanding Alternative KPIs\n\nFinally, the Alternative KPIs gives you key information to gauge the health of the business:\n\n\u201cDaily Active Users\u201d is like the number of loyal customers. DAU is one of the most important metrics in blockchain, due to network effects. (Please read our piece on Daily Active Users: Like X-Ray Vision for Crypto Investors.)\n\n\u201cActive Developers\u201d and \u201cCode Commits\u201d shows you how many people are actually behind these projects. Think of this like the size of the tech team, and how many big changes they are making each quarter.\n\nLet\u2019s compare these metrics for bitcoin and Ethereum:\n\nThe story: You\u2019ll be surprised to learn that bitcoin had only 13 active developers last quarter, while Ethereum had 165. The team made just 250 changes (code commits) for bitcoin, versus 2,000 for Ethereum.\n\nThis paints a picture of Ethereum as a growing, vibrant ecosystem, with bitcoin a tiny squad of developers keeping the lights on. (And as the Wall Street Journal reported today, this is indeed the case.\n\nPutting it All Together\n\nThese financial reports are a significant milestone for the crypto industry. They\u2019re not perfect. They could be more intuitive. But they\u2019re the start of something really great: a picture of financial health over time.\n\nNo more do we have to rely on hype and headlines to make investing decisions: we can now evaluate the businesses ourselves, using reason and reporting over FUD and FOMO.\n\nThese reports are still a work in progress, since there are no Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for crypto. In fact, most people won\u2019t even admit that cryptos are companies. Which is why these reports are a godsend for the serious crypto investor.\n\nWe\u2019ve been saying for years the obvious truth: even if they\u2019re not technically companies, we can think of cryptos like companies. With these new financial reports, we now have a powerful new tool to evaluate their corporate performance.\n\nIt\u2019s the crypto investor\u2019s secret weapon.\n\n50,000 crypto investors get this column every Friday.

        "title": "Bitcoin bears attempt to pin BTC price under $23K ahead of this month's options expiry - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) 16% price gain between Feb. 13 and Feb. 16 practically extinguished the bears' expectation for a monthly options expiry below $21,500. As a result of the abrupt rally, these bearish bets are unlikely to pay off, especially since the expiry occurs on Feb. 24. However, bulls were not counting on the strong price rejection at $25,200 on Feb. 21, and this reduces their odds of securing a $480 million profit in this month\u2019s BTC options expiry.\n\nBitcoin investors' primary concern is a stricter monetary policy as the U.S. Federal Reserve increases interest rates and reduces its $8 trillion balance sheet. Feb. 22 minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed that members were in consensus on the most recent 25 basis point rate hike and that the Fed is willing to continue raising rates as long as deemed necessary.\n\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard told CNBC on Feb. 22 that a more aggressive interest rate hike would give them a better chance to contain inflation. Bullard said:\n\n\"Let's be sharp now, let's get inflation under control in 2023.\"\n\nIf confirmed, the increased interest rate pace would be negative for risk assets, including Bitcoin, as it draws more profitability for fixed-income investments.\n\nEven if the newsflow remains negative, bulls still can profit up to $480 million in Friday's monthly options expiry. However, bears can still significantly improve their situation by pushing the BTC price below $23,000.\n\nBears were not expecting Bitcoin to hold $22,000\n\nThe open interest for the Feb. 24 monthly options expiry is $1.91 billion, but the actual figure will be lower since bears expected prices below $23,000. Nevertheless, these traders were surprised as Bitcoin gained 13.5% between Feb. 15 and Feb. 16.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for Feb. 24. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 1.55 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $1.16 billion call (buy) open interest and the $750 million put (sell) options. If Bitcoin's price remains near $24,000 at 8:00 am UTC on Feb. 24, only $125 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to sell Bitcoin at $22,000 or $23,000 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\nBulls aim for $23,000 to secure a $155 million profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Feb. 17 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes these theoretical profits:\n\nBetween $22,500 and $23,000: 12,500 calls vs. 10,700 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $40 million.\n\n12,500 calls vs. 10,700 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $40 million. Between $23,000 and $24,000: 16,200 calls vs. 7,600 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $200 million.\n\n16,200 calls vs. 7,600 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $200 million. Between $24,000 and $24,500: 21,100 calls vs. 5,200 puts. Bulls increase their advantage to $385 million.\n\n21,100 calls vs. 5,200 puts. Bulls increase their advantage to $385 million. Between $24,500 and $25,000: 23,200 calls vs. 3,600 puts. Bulls dominate by profiting $480 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor example, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining inverse exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price, but unfortunately there's no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nRelated: US lawmaker introduces bill aimed at limiting Fed\u2019s authority on digital dollar\n\nThe Fed's tightening policy is the bears\u2019 best shot\n\nBitcoin bulls must push the price above $24,500 on Feb. 24 to secure a potential $480 million profit. On the other hand, the bears' best-case scenario requires a 3.5% price dump below $23,000 to minimize their losses.\n\nConsidering the negative pressure from the Fed's desire to weaken the economy and contain inflation, bears have good odds of improving their situation and settling with a $40 million loss on Feb. 24. This movement might not be successful, but it is the bears' only way out of multi-million losses on the BTC monthly options expiry.\n\nLooking at a broader time frame, investors still believe the Fed is destined to reverse the current monetary policy in the second half of 2023 \u2014 possibly paving the way for a sustainable rally ahead of the April 2024 Bitcoin block reward halving.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Fear, uncertainty and doubt: Global regulatory challenges of crypto insolvencies - World Bank",
        "content": "\n\nLegal qualification of a crypto asset can be complicated. Cryptocurrency at its core is cryptographic code, which raises the question of how to legally classify these assets. Is it property, security, currency, or something else? There is no universal consensus on this issue and depending on the jurisdiction and the agreement between the parties, specific classification of this asset might impact the ability to get a freezing injunction against an insolvent company. Classification could raise other insolvency-related questions, such as the ability for a company to use a particular asset as a collateral to obtain rescue financing. Also, individual cryptocurrencies might be classified differently, leading to questions about regulatory jurisdiction, as was pointed out, for example, by the chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which may differentiate Bitcoin from other cryptos.\n\n\n\nAsset-tracing and recovery can be a significant challenge. With anonymity as one of the distinct features of crypto assets, they might not be easily identifiable, and tracing such assets requires special skills and engagement of blockchain analytics companies. An even bigger challenge might be when companies\u2019 assets are stored on private addresses, known in the industry as cold wallets, as opposed to exchange-controlled accounts, or hot wallets. Cold wallets provide the highest decentralized level of security to the cryptocurrency user. They are practically impossible to break without a private key that is usually only known to the owner. This feature of anonymity can potentially provide a value proposition of securing personal funds, especially for the most vulnerable. However, funds on a cold wallet can be a crucial challenge in insolvency proceedings if there is a need to secure the company\u2019s assets. Even if a wallet\u2019s geographic location is identified and it can be physically seized, it would be extremely hard, if not impossible, to recover the funds from such a wallet without the owner\u2019s cooperation. For example, this happened in Quadriga\u2019s insolvency case and the related death of the exchange\u2019s CEO, Gerald Cotton, who owned the cold wallet with the assumed company\u2019s funds, which therefore vanished. The potential solution, in this case, might be a transparent corporate governance regulation where a CEO or company\u2019s officer of a crypto company doesn\u2019t have exclusive access to the company\u2019s crypto funds. For this purpose, using a digital wallet that operates with multi-signature address and requires more than one private key to authorize a transaction could be an option, or using a service of a trusted crypto custodian or some other alternatives that can ensure transparent and secure accessibility of a company\u2019s funds.\n\n\n\nTreatment of creditors poses a separate risk, and depending on the nature of a company, it can influence many individual retail investors and have a more significant systemic effect on an economy. In this respect, the crypto industry is characterized by the lack of any safety nets, such as investor protection funds, that are common in many securities markets. Take the case of Celsius Network, mentioned earlier. According to Celsius\u2019 terms of service, the treatment of customers\u2019 digital assets in the event of an insolvency proceeding is \u201cunsettled\u201d and \u201cnot guaranteed\u201d and may result in clients being classified as an unsecured creditor \u201cand/or the total loss\u201d of the assets. Respective agreements between the parties should also be appropriately interpreted within the insolvency frameworks of specific jurisdictions. In the recent development of the ongoing Celsius insolvency case, a US bankruptcy judge ruled that the deposits in the yield-bearing Earn accounts belong to Celsius, not individual account holders. As with many other crypto-related issues, lack of clarity on this matter, can create procedural challenges and might require appropriate regulatory intervention.\n\n\n\nDistribution to creditors can be especially uncertain. Volatility is a central characterization of cryptocurrencies, a trade-off for its decentralization. As the most used cryptocurrency, Bitcoin can be incredibly volatile. Between April 2022 and January 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s value more than halved, from just over $45,000 to below $20,000. But three years ago, Bitcoin was half the current price and traded at levels below $10,000. Such recurring and unpredictable \u2018booms and busts\u2019 in the crypto industry can be a challenge in insolvency proceedings at the stage of paying proceeds to creditors, if the distribution was to be made in the legal currency of the country, as many insolvency laws currently require, instead of distributing the crypto assets themselves. From the moment of determining the payment amount and actual distribution to the creditor, the cryptocurrency can move substantially.\n\n\n\nAdded to the complexity of the distribution to creditors is the practical challenge of delivering the funds to multiple creditors, possibly residing in different jurisdictions. For example, Celsius reportedly served 40,000 members from over 150 countries. Distributing funds as part of an insolvency process can also be costly, particularly when cross-border bank transfers are necessary. To overcome this challenge, it may be worthwhile to consider distributing the assets in cryptocurrency. This is because, as the Bitcoin community often says, \u201c1 BTC = 1 BTC\u201d, meaning that the value of one Bitcoin is the same, regardless of where it is held in the world.\n\n\n\nDespite the current decline in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin and other digital assets are likely here to stay for the foreseeable future. While cryptocurrencies have brought certain innovations, they have also introduced new risks, which have created FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) for financial supervisors and regulators in different areas, including insolvency. A practical, comprehensive, and transparent regulatory framework that addresses some critical challenges that have appeared from recent crypto-related insolvencies could help to reduce some of these risks."

        "title": "Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin lingers at US$24,000 level after Wall Street\u2019s worst day in 2023 so far - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, inched up 0.48% in the week from Feb. 17 to Feb. 24, trading at US$23,932 at 8:30 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether slid 1.04% in the same period to change hands at US$1,648.\n\nDespite Wall Street posting this year\u2019s worst performance on Tuesday, Bitcoin remained resilient, briefly dropping below the US$24,000 price level the next day, before reclaiming it again.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Bitcoin remained resilient during Wall Street\u2019s biggest loss of the year and even recovered after briefly dipping below the US$24,000 mark suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s correlation to U.S. equity markets is not very strong. In fact, Bitcoin\u2019s correlation to the S&P 500 is at its lowest since late 2021, according to data from Dylan LeClair, senior analyst at digital asset fund UTXO Management, on Twitter. However, the two assets are still positively correlated,\u201d wrote Jonas Betz, a Germany-based crypto analyst, in a LinkedIn response to Forkast.\n\nKasper Vandeloock, chief executive officer of quantitative trading firm Musca Capital, told Forkast that there is still \u201ca strong correlation\u201d between the Nasdaq and the crypto market and that investors are looking for fiat alternatives.\n\n\u201cPeople are fleeing to Bitcoin as trust in fiat currencies and traditional systems are dropping. Banks in Lebanon are being put on fire because of limits on cash withdrawals. The value of currencies has dropped a lot, people are looking for alternatives,\u201d Vandeloock said.\n\nKarlen Danielian, the founder and chief executive officer of play-and-earn metaverse 2040world, said that Bitcoin is highly correlated with the U.S. stock market, particularly the S&P 500.\n\n\u201cRecently, Bitcoin has shown strength compared to the stock market. There is a theory that this is due to expectations for the development of the cryptocurrency market in China via Hong Kong. I believe that Chinese money can greatly help the growth of the cryptocurrency market, and Bitcoin in particular, in the coming years,\u201d wrote Danielian to Forkast.\n\nUnemployment benefits claims in the U.S. fell by 3,000 last week to 192,000, according to data released by the Department of Labor on Thursday, lower than the 200,000 forecasted by economists surveyed by Reuters. The tight labor market could have prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at US$1.09 trillion on Friday at 8:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, the same value as a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$461 billion market cap represented 42.2% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$201 billion accounted for 18.5%.\n\nSee related article: Industry reacts: US cracks down on crypto, India calls for regulatory collaboration\n\nBiggest gainers: STX & CFX\n\nSTX, the native token of the Stacks Network, was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. STX was up 133% on the weekly chart to trade at US$0.75 at 8:30 p.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nStacks is a Bitcoin layer-2 that allows developers to deploy smart contracts, bringing decentralized applications such as NFTs to the network. The STX token started its rally on Feb. 19, fueled by renewed interest in Bitcoin-native NFTs after the launch of Bitcoin Ordinals, a protocol that allows users to inscribe data on satoshis, the lowest denomination of Bitcoin.\n\nOrdinals Inscriptions surpassed 154,000 on Feb. 21, adding more fuel to the STX rally.\n\n\u201cBTC now has an extra use case other than just being a currency. BTC is now a place where NFTs or \u201cdigital artifacts\u201d can be created and stored on every single node on the BTC network. The added benefit of having a rock-solid use case of NFTs added to BTC will impact miner fees to go up as demand for network resources go up,\u201d wrote Yohann Calpu, chief marketing officer at NFT data aggregator CryptoSlam, to Forkast.\n\nBetz said that Bitcoin Ordinals have an immutability benefit over traditional NFTs.\n\n\u201cOrdinals have an immutability benefit over traditional NFTs as ordinals allow users to store all the data directly and permanently on the Bitcoin blockchain. Proof-of-stake-based NFTs on the other hand often require off-chain data storage and could be altered using metadata,\u201d wrote Betz.\n\nConflux\u2019s native token (CFX) was this week\u2019s second-biggest gainer in the top 100 coins. Conflux Network is an interoperability-focused protocol and the only public, permissionless blockchain with regulatory compliance in China.\n\nCFX was up 84.54% on the weekly chart, changing hands at US$0.27. The token started its rally on Jan. 26, after news emerged of Conflux partnering Little Red Book, a Chinese social media platform, enabling over 200 million users to mint their profile pictures as NFTs on Conflux.\n\nNext week?\n\n\u201cThe current support level is in the US$23,375-23,600 range, as this marks the lows of the retracements of Bitcoin\u2019s failed attempts to break through US$25,000,\u201d wrote crypto analyst Betz.\n\n\u201cThe most important resistance that Bitcoin has to overcome is the psychological mark of US$25,000. Unfortunately, Bitcoin has failed to break through this resistance three times in the last 7 days. This in turn means that a future breakout is even more significant and could be greeted with great euphoria,\u201d he wrote, adding that he expects \u201ca breakout and subsequent fall of Bitcoin into the US$21,000 to US$22,500 range,\u201d due to Bitcoin\u2019s previous attempts to breach US$25,000 and the Fed\u2019s signals to raise interest rates further.\n\nAziz Kenjaev, head of partnerships at decentralized crypto derivatives exchange GammaX, also expects a downtrend next week, with Bitcoin heading towards US$21,500-22,300.\n\n\u201cAs per the technical outlook, Bitcoin bounced back from the important dynamic resistance at US$25,266, this level was retested again and created a strong static resistance, hence buyers\u2019 pressure is getting weaker. If bears can push BTC below US$23,500 it will most likely drop to US$21,500-22,300,\u201d wrote Kenjaev.\n\n\u201cAs the regulatory provisions of the crypto market are set to take higher pace this year, after the FTX collapse, we might also see watchdogs reporting concerns over several crypto-projects. In addition, FSB (Financial Stability Board) will release a report on findings in their cryptocurrency and stablecoin research in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund. This could result in uncertainty in the market,\u201d added Kenjaev.\n\nDanielian said that US$25,000 is a key price level for Bitcoin: \u201cIt is crucial for Bitcoin to break through and establish itself above the US$25,000 level, and then we can say that the market has turned from bearish to bullish.\u201d\n\nVandeloock said there is a large focus on Asian and Chinese coins right now, which he expects to shift back to AI coins, adding that \u201cAI projects such as 0xAI have gained massive attention.\u201d\n\nSee related article: Be careful what you wish for?

        "title": "How to Short Bitcoin \u2013 A Complete Guide - FX Empire",
        "content": "A CFD is a derivative. This is a frightening word for newcomers, but it simply means that the value of the instrument is determined by the value of something else. In this case, the value of the CFD is determined by the change in the price of Bitcoin. Investors buying a CFD do not actually own Bitcoin. They only own the change in the price of Bitcoin.\n\nJust like the terms of shorting, the terms of a CFD vary by broker. Again, investors need to do some homework and find a broker that meets their needs. This includes the financial requirements for trading. Among these brokers, you can find Plus 500 *(86% of retail CFD accounts lose money), AvaTrade and FXTM. Investors who meet the definition of an accredited investor have access to investment products and strategies that are not available to the general public under US securities law.\n\nFurthermore, there are various brokers that provide CFD\u2019s which allow you to short other cryptocurrencies. See the list below:\n\nShorting Bitcoin via Futures Market (Cboe/CME)\n\nOne the easiest parts of a CFD to understand is that it measures the difference in the price of Bitcoin over a period of time. In this sense, a CFD \u201cbuys\u201d the future price of Bitcoin. This can be done directly through the latest development in Bitcoin trading, futures contracts in Bitcoin.\n\nFutures are easy to understand by beginning with their origins in the agricultural sector. A farmer who plants a corn crop cannot know what price it will bring when the crop is harvested. To eliminate this uncertainty he can buy a futures contract that will give him the right to sell his corn at a started price when it is harvested. The actual price at that time \u2013 the \u201cspot\u201d price \u2013 may be higher or lower, but his price is fixed by the futures contract.\n\nBitcoin futures contracts are available for as few as a single Bitcoin and have expiration dates ranging from one week to three months. One of the benefits of a future is that they can be traded before the contract expires. This means an investor can buy a futures contract and realize some of the value from that contract (presuming it has value) before the expiration date by selling the contract to another investor.\n\nSuggested Articles\n\nBitcoin Short \u2013 Pros and Cons\n\nShorting Bitcoin, or any financial asset for that matter, can get fairly complicated. However, the most important point to remember is that the most basic risk remains the same for the futures buyer as the straight short-seller. The potential loss has no cap, but the potential gain is limited to the current market price.\n\nInvestors use the strategies to short Bitcoin for a more important reason than just an expectation that the price will drop. Keep in mind that every strategy to short Bitcoin can be used to profit from a price increase. The most basic reason investors use margin, derivatives and futures is that these strategies employ leverage in one way or another.\n\nThese strategies allow the investor to own the change in price with a smaller investment than the current price of Bitcoin. In the case of a short, the price is the total transaction fees and interest. Leverage is a powerful financial tool used by every homeowner with a mortgage. Leverage multiplies the return on an investment that performs as expected, but also multiples the loss when it does not pan out.\n\nConclusion\n\nInvestors who have managed to grasp the relationship between blockchain and cryptocurrencies and then built on that to learn how to trade Bitcoin on exchanges have still only scratched the surface of how to profit from their knowledge. Understanding technical analysis \u2013reading the patterns in the ups and downs of the market \u2013 is also only a step on the path to becoming a fully-equipped Bitcoin investor.\n\nGaining an understanding of how to profit from any movement in the price of Bitcoin could be the most important task the serious, savvy investor can undertake. Working through the math of how leverage increases Return on Investment (ROI) is part of understanding why margins, derivatives, and futures are so powerful. Working through the math of these instruments when they move in a bad direction is just as important to understanding the risk of leverage.\n\nThese building blocks are not always easy to acquire, but they are always worthwhile to have, even if the investor chooses not to use them. Understanding and tracking the futures market, for example, gives the investor insight into what other, perhaps more sophisticated investors, think will happen in the future. That knowledge can be power."

        "content": "The dust has settled. The battlefield is still.\n\nAnd, as has been widely reported this week, Agust\u00edn Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), has declared crypto the loser.\n\n\u201cA few years ago, crypto assets and cryptocurrencies have been put as an alternative to fiat money,\u201d Carstens told Bloomberg in an interview posted Wednesday (Feb. 22). \u201cThat battle has been won.\u201d\n\nCarstens also said that technology does not pave the way for \u201ctrusted money\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s the central banks, and their infrastructure, that gives money \u201ccredibility.\u201d\n\nSeparately, in a speech given in Singapore that same day, Carstens noted that distributed ledger technology (DLT) can lead to new payments technologies and use cases. And in a nod to the convergence of bank infrastructure, credibility and technologies, he noted that there\u2019s a place for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and for tokenized deposits.\n\n\u201cCBDCs and tokenized deposits would appear in separate partitions in the unified ledger. Because they share a common ledger, they can be brought together and used in an efficient way, through smart contracts,\u201d said Carstens \u2014 where CBDCs play the same role as central bank money, tokenized deposits are commercial bank money.\n\nReplicating Existing Money\n\nThese offerings are, he said, ways of replicating existing money with technology.\n\n\u201cWhat makes central bank money and commercial bank money indistinguishable today is a complex and well developed network of institutional arrangements, including regulation, supervision, deposit insurance and settlement on the central bank\u2019s book,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe same should be true of CBDC and tokenized deposits.\u201d Stablecoins don\u2019t fit the bill here, he said, because they don\u2019t have the same regulations in place.\n\nThe path toward CBDCs, we note, is becoming increasingly wider. As we reported here, countries spanning China, Singapore, Australia, Japan, Korea and Hong Kong are already piloting CBDCs, or plan to this year. The Bank of England is in the mix, too.\n\nTokenized deposits offer an alternative to the stablecoin model and to cryptos in general as they enable direct bank-to-bank activity. Rob Hunter, deputy general counsel and director of regulatory and legislative affairs at The Clearing House (TCH), told Karen Webster the deposits would be underpinned by blockchain technology. The use of blockchain has become widespread, especially among multinational firms. In our research on blockchain and cross-border payments, we found that 56% of cross-border businesses that use blockchain technology in their operations.\n\nAnd while bitcoin has been used by 47% of businesses, the fact is that regulatory clarity remains at the top of the list when it comes to deciding whether to use cryptos or stablecoins at all (cited by 52% of multinationals). Regulators are cracking down on crypto and stablecoin firms, warning of risks and even curtailing some firms\u2019 issuance of coins. The easiest regulatory \u201cpath\u201d \u2014 especially for using digital payments and deposits \u2014 may be to hew to the monetary system and channels that are already in place. And in that case, the battle against bitcoin \u2014 waged with CBDCs and tokenized deposits \u2014 may indeed be decided."

        "content": "As some $1.85 billion worth of Bitcoin options contracts are set to expire tomorrow, bearish and bullish traders are almost evenly pitted against each other.\n\nThe tug of war between the optimistic bets \u2013 or calls, and pessimistic ones \u2013 or puts, \u201clooks neutral\u201d as the expiry date of the derivatives nears, Darius Tabatabai, co-founder of decentralised exchange Vertex Protocol and a former Credit Suisse trader, told DL News.\n\nBitcoin options are a type of derivative contract that grant the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy Bitcoin at a predetermined price at a future date.\n\nBitcoin bears have been piling into bets that recent regulatory pitfalls will act as a drag on the crypto\u2019s price. Bulls will win out should that regulatory crackdown look overly pessimistic. Tabatabai explained that because calls and puts are relatively balanced, market makers could keep the top cryptocurrency pinned close to the current $23,500 to $24,500 trading range.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nBTC options open interest by strike price, February 24 expiry. (coinglass)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s put-to-call ratio \u2013 derived by dividing the number of traded put options by the number of traded call options \u2013 sits at 0.67 for the February 24 expiry, indicating only a slight bullish bias. Because traders typically buy more calls than puts, a ratio of less than 0.7 is usually considered bullish, as it means significantly more calls were bought versus puts.\n\nHowever, despite the neutral outlook, bears may try to push Bitcoin\u2019s price toward its \u201cmax pain\u201d level at $22,000.\n\nEach option contract has a strike price. Only when the price of the underlying asset moves above this price for call options or below for puts does the contract make money.\n\nMax pain, or the max pain price, is the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts expire at no profit. It suggests that the price of an underlying asset tends to gravitate towards its max pain strike price as market makers hedge their positions to remain neutral.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin call options skew toward the $26,000 and $28,000 strikes, with another spike at $24,000. While puts are more distributed, there is also a large spike in volume at the $24,000 strike, making it a battleground price."

        "content": "The \u201cCryptoqueen\u201d vanished more than five years ago with more than $4 billion, and at least one report said she was murdered roughly a year later.\n\nA new police document, published by Bulgarian investigative outlet BIRD, or the Bureau for Investigative Reporting and Data, suggests that Ruja Ignatova, who disappeared in 2017 after scamming investors with a fake cryptocurrency, was killed in a hit ordered by a Bulgarian crime boss.\n\nBut Atanas Tchobanov, a journalist at BIRD who worked with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists to publish the Pandora Papers, told Fortune that scenario was just \u201ca hypothesis.\u201d BIRD first caught wind of the rumored murder while reporting on a police officer shot dead in March 2022.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not conclusive,\u201d added Tchobanov, who was once a member of the board of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project.\n\nThe document in question was found in a safe in the police officer\u2019s apartment. There was a one-page report that detailed how the brother-in-law of Bulgarian crime boss Christophoros Amanatidis, a.k.a. Taki, drunkenly told an anonymous informant during a yacht trip in Cuba that Taki had ordered a successful hit on Ignatova. According to this account, Ignatova was killed on another yacht in the Ionian Sea in November 2018, and her body was carved up and tossed overboard.\n\nThis account is heavy on hearsay and so should be taken with a grain of salt. That said, it is one of the few public leads to detail the whereabouts of Ignatova, who landed on the FBI\u2019s most wanted list after absconding with billions.\n\nMoreover, Tchobanov said, a source who was in contact with Ignatova\u2019s brother disputed the document published by BIRD. That source said Ignatova contacted her brother in early 2019, months after her rumored killing.\n\nIn January, she was reported to be selling a four-bedroom penthouse in London for approximately $13 million. Instead, prosecutors in Germany were organizing the sale, after having seized the property.\n\nThe Cryptoqueen rose to prominence in 2014, when Ignatova, a German-Bulgarian businesswoman, suddenly announced that she had created a rival to Bitcoin called OneCoin.\n\n\u201cOneCoin is easy to use. OneCoin is for everyone,\u201d she said to a packed stadium in England in 2016. \u201cMake payments everywhere, everyone, globally.\u201d\n\nUsing multi-level marketing tactics, she convinced crypto newbies to invest billions in her project, which turned out to be a pyramid scheme. Her new token didn\u2019t even run on a blockchain.\n\nIn 2017, after reportedly undergoing multiple plastic surgeries, she boarded a plane from Bulgaria to Greece and was never seen again. Today she would be 42."

        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs Stacks or Ordinals? - NFT Culture",
        "content": "Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency that operates on a public ledger called the blockchain. Over the years, the Bitcoin network has evolved to include various layers and protocols that allow for additional functionality and features beyond simple payments. One of these protocols is the ability to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nNFTs are unique digital assets that can represent anything from art to collectibles to in-game items. They are \u201cnon-fungible\u201d because each token is unique and cannot be exchanged for another token of equal value, unlike fungible tokens like Bitcoin itself. NFTs have become increasingly popular in recent years, with many high-profile sales of digital art and collectibles.\n\nThe first NFT standard on the Bitcoin blockchain was called Colored Coins, which was created in 2012. Colored Coins allowed users to attach additional information to Bitcoin transactions, essentially creating a new type of asset that could be traded on the blockchain. However, Colored Coins never gained widespread adoption and was eventually supplanted by other NFT protocols.\n\nOne of the most promising NFT protocols on the Bitcoin blockchain today is Ordinals. Ordinals is a simple and elegant protocol that allows users to \u201cinscribe\u201d up to 3.9 MB of data on the Bitcoin blockchain without the use of smart contracts. These inscriptions can represent anything from art to music to text. Because the inscriptions are directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, they are highly secure and tamper-resistant. Ordinals are fully backed by Bitcoin\u2019s hash power and decentralization, making them permanent and as permanent as anything ever known. They can be exchanged like Bitcoin and used as proof of ownership for digital assets.\n\nStacks vs. Ordinals?\n\nStacks and Ordinals are two different protocols that utilize the Bitcoin blockchain, each with their unique set of features and use cases.\n\nStacks is a layer on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that allows developers to build Ethereum-style smart contracts that read, write, and secure data on Bitcoin. It is similar to a sidechain in that it has its own ledger and virtual machine, but it also has properties of a layer-two scaling solution because it inherits security (finality) from Bitcoin L1. Stacks enables developers to create a range of decentralized applications (dApps) that can interact with Bitcoin in a secure and trustless manner. However, Bitcoin itself cannot verify Stacks transactions, so Stacks requires a separate consensus mechanism to secure its ledger.\n\nOn the other hand, Ordinals is a protocol on Bitcoin L1 that allows users to \u201cinscribe\u201d data up to 3.9 MB on the Bitcoin blockchain without the use of smart contracts. Ordinals are essentially non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are fully backed by Bitcoin\u2019s hash power and decentralization. They are permanent and can be exchanged like Bitcoin. Because they are inscribed directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, they are highly secure and tamper-resistant.\n\nIn summary, while Stacks and Ordinals both use the Bitcoin blockchain, they have different characteristics and use cases. Stacks allows developers to build complex dApps that can interact with Bitcoin, while Ordinals provide a simple and elegant way to inscribe data on the Bitcoin blockchain without the use of smart contracts. Both protocols have their unique advantages and are being developed by a community of builders who are committed to advancing the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nFriend of NFT Culture TO also has a great thread that inspired this post."

Former Cohasset assistant facilities director Nadeam Nahas, 39, was due to be arraigned in Quincy District Court Thursday but never showed up, forcing the judge to issue a warrant for his arrest.\n\nCohasset police said another town worker discovered the mining setup in a \"remote crawl space under the school\" in December of 2021. He saw electrical wires and several computers \"that seemed out of place,\" police said.\n\nThe operation was illegally using power from the school's electrical system, police determined after consulting IT professionals. Investigators with the Coast Guard and Homeland Security helped to safely remove the mining equipment and figure out where it came from.\n\nThe equipment used in the alleged cryptocurrency mining operation, and the crawl space in Cohasset. Cohasset Police\n\n\"He was effectively creating money,\" said Larry Glazer, a crypto expert and managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston.\n\nGlazer said the suspect was likely using the crawl space operation to create his own money on the taxpayers' dime.\n\n\"It's something that can't be done efficiently at home in New England because the cost of electricity is so prohibitively expensive,\" he said. \"You had an employee who was effectively stealing electricity from the community from the taxpayers and from the town.\"\n\nAfter a three-month investigation, police charged Nahas with fraudulent use of electricity and vandalizing the school. Nahas resigned from his job in early 2022, police said.\n\nCohasset Public Schools told WBZ-TV in a statement \"we were cooperative in assisting the Cohasset Police throughout the investigation,\" but offered no further comment.\n\nAs CBS News explains, crypto is digital currency that can be made or \"mined\" by using specialized computer processors running on vast amounts of electricity."

        "content": "On Tuesday, FTX Japan, a subsidiary of FTX, began allowing customers to withdraw funds frozen in the now-defunct crypto exchange. Transfers for Japanese customers started being processed later that day, making them some of the first FTX users in the world to get their money back.\n\nMany of these customers are now breathing a sigh of relief, after four months of alarm and uncertainty. In the mad rush to claim these withdrawals, however, others have run into hurdles, and taken to Japanese social media to share their accounts. Some users are being told they aren\u2019t eligible for withdrawals at all. Rest of World spoke to seven FTX Japan customers, most of whom say they feel like they\u2019ve fallen victim to a bait-and-switch.\n\nYakiginnan, who asked to use his social media name to protect his privacy, is a 48-year-old working in asset management. He is one of the many customers to successfully complete his withdrawal. He had roughly 2 million yen ($14,800) in bitcoin with FTX Japan, which was returned in full on Wednesday. Instead of celebrating, though, he has spent the last few days contacting FTX Japan\u2019s customer support on behalf of those who haven\u2019t seen a dollar.\n\n\u201cI am very angry because I know that there are many people, including my daughter, who were denied the return of their assets,\u201d he told Rest of World. \u201cAnd I am angry that FTX Japan has been falsely announcing that the assets are segregated and properly protected, when, in fact, they were not.\u201d\n\nRest of World joined one Discord group this week that had over 50 victims of FTX. Using public Twitter accounts, many members of the community are now pushing for clarity from FTX Japan on why customers still haven\u2019t been able to withdraw, and have demanded a closer investigation from Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency (FSA).\n\nFTX Japan did not answer questions from Rest of World about why some customers have been denied their withdrawals. In a blogpost published on February 22, the company announced it had issued withdrawals of more than 6 billion yen ($49 million) to 3,454 individual accounts and 94 corporate accounts in the first two days.\n\nThe FTX saga began in early November 2022, when Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s massive crypto exchange collapsed following allegations that the company had severely mismanaged customer assets. FTX Japan was one in a web of international FTX subsidiaries. But, unlike other subsidiaries, FTX Japan was under the purview of strict Japanese crypto regulations. As a result, the company claimed that the exchange was still solvent.\n\nIt\u2019s taken FTX Japan four months to restart withdrawals, which required an ambitious plan overseen by Japanese regulators to sidestep the now-defunct FTX system. Rest of World previously reported on the plan\u2019s unique challenges, which entailed reviving an exchange discontinued in Japan \u2014 called Liquid.com \u2014 to deliver withdrawals.\n\nMeanwhile, FTX Japan has issued updates to customers claiming that the exchange was solvent and explaining how Japan\u2019s notoriously strict regulations, including restrictions on the movement of customers\u2019 assets, have insulated users from the wholesale losses of FTX users elsewhere.\n\nYakiginnan says his daughter has roughly 200,000 yen ($1,480) in FTX. But when she applied for her withdrawal through Liquid.com, she received a notification that she was ineligible to complete the transaction. In fact, she was told her assets weren\u2019t managed by FTX Japan at all, but rather by its parent company, currently in the midst of bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nMany customers have taken to social media to share screenshots of similar notifications. Some had used FTX International\u2019s exchange website, FTX.com, or the FTX app prior to FTX Japan\u2019s official launch in June 2022. They are being told that they did not successfully transfer their assets after the June launch.\n\nOne customer, who asked to remain anonymous over privacy concerns, told Rest of World he has lost almost all the assets he had saved since 2014 \u2014 nearly $140,000 \u2014 due to the FTX collapse. Initially an FTX app customer, in May 2022, he conducted a Know Your Customer (KYC) check to verify his identity, he thought, for FTX Japan. FTX Japan claims that since he did not complete an additional KYC check after June, his assets were never transferred properly, despite his registration with the subsidiary and the fact the domestic app was branded as FTX JP at the time, he said.\n\n\u201cMy biggest concern is that I will be recognized as an FTX.com user by FTX Japan and as an FTX Japan user by FTX.com, leaving me hanging in the balance,\u201d he said.\n\nFor many, the sudden disclosure that their assets were never managed by FTX Japan, after months of messaging from the subsidiary that they had been protected from the fallout, has come as a shock.\n\nYakiginnan says his daughter opened her account using the FTX JP app, so there should be no need to transfer the account from FTX International.\n\nOthers, though, still aren\u2019t sure why withdrawals aren\u2019t coming through. Initial restrictions and delays on the withdrawals of both Bitcoin and Ripple cryptocurrencies appear to have mostly been resolved. But Wagami, a computer graphics designer who asked to use only her last name to protect her privacy, told Rest of World she still receives error messages when she tries to apply for a withdrawal. \u201cThere are people with the same status who are able to withdraw and people who are not able to withdraw. It is very frustrating because I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI would like to see an investigation into the cause of the problem and a response from FTX as soon as possible,\u201d said Wagami. \u201cI can\u2019t say yet if I will get a refund, but I believe I will. That\u2019s my only option.\u201d"

        "title": "10 Milestones that have Shaped the Popular Crypto Bitcoin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Explore the 10 Milestones that Shaped the Popular Crypto Bitcoin\n\nThe most well-known and valued cryptocurrency in the world is Bitcoin, which was developed in 2008 by an unidentified individual or group known only as Satoshi Nakamoto. The price of a single bitcoin rose from less than a cent to more than $60,000 at its peak during its rapid rise. Numerous turning points in Bitcoin\u2019s history have affected the currency\u2019s development and contributed to its success.\n\nHere are 10 key moments in the history of Bitcoin\n\nThe Creation of Bitcoin \u2013 January 2009\n\nThe biggest turning point in its history may have been the invention of Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto released the \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d white paper in 2008, and on January 3, 2009, the Genesis block, the first block of the Bitcoin network, was mined.\n\nPizza Day \u2013 May 22, 2010\n\nA developer by the name of Laszlo Hanyecz carried out the first Bitcoin transaction in the real world on May 22, 2010. He purchased two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins, and the transaction became known as \u201cPizza Day.\u201d For the first time, Bitcoin was utilised as a means of exchange as opposed to merely a speculative asset.\n\nMt. Gox Hack \u2013 February 2014\n\nAt the time, the biggest Bitcoin exchange in the world was Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based business. But in February 2014, the exchange was hacked, and about 850,000 bitcoins\u2014worth $500 million at the time\u2014were taken. This incident, which was among the biggest security lapses in Bitcoin history, left a lasting impression on the sector.\n\nSilk Road Shutdown \u2013 October 2013\n\nUsing Bitcoin as a form of payment, users may buy and trade illegal narcotics on Silk Road, an online marketplace. In October 2013, the FBI shut down the website, and Ross Ulbricht, its creator, was taken into custody. This incident brought Bitcoin into the attention of the general media and caused heightened examination of the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum Launch \u2013 July 2015\n\nDevelopers can create and implement decentralised apps (dApps) using the decentralised Ethereum platform. The introduction of smart contracts to the world with the launch of Ethereum in July 2015 opened the door for the creation of numerous more blockchain-based projects.\n\nSegWit Activation \u2013 August 2017\n\nA soft fork upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol called Segregated Witness (SegWit) raises the block size cap and fixes a transaction malleability flaw. SegWit\u2019s activation in August 2017 marked a critical turning point for Bitcoin since it made it possible to create second-layer scaling solutions like the Lightning Network.\n\nBitcoin Cash Hard Fork \u2013 August 2017\n\nIn August 2017, a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash was produced. A debate regarding the most effective strategy to scale the Bitcoin network led to the split within the community. Because Bitcoin Cash has a higher block size limit than Bitcoin, transactions can be completed more quickly and for less money.\n\nBitcoin Futures Launch \u2013 December 2017\n\nTrading in Bitcoin futures began in December 2017 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). This was a crucial step in the adoption of Bitcoin because it allowed for the first time its trading on a regulated exchange.\n\nBitcoin Reaches $20,000 \u2013 December 2017\n\nThe price of Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $20,000 in December 2017, which was a crucial turning point in the history of the cryptocurrency. Increased institutional investor interest and the start of Bitcoin futures trading were cited as the causes of the price spike.\n\nBitcoin Halving \u2013 May 2020\n\nThe Bitcoin network experiences a halving event every four years where the incentives for mining new blocks are reduced by half. This incident is important because it brings attention to Bitcoin\u2019s finite supply and deflationary monetary policy.\n\nConclusion: These are some of the key milestones that have shaped the Bitcoin as a popular cryptocurrency. While there have been challenges along the way, Bitcoin has persevered and continues to be a major player in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Although as of now this could only work in LTC apart from bitcoin network as they have its soft forks of the SegWit and Taproot technology, there are possibilities where this could be developed for other blockchains."

        "content": "How Bitcoin and crypto could revolutionise the housing market\n\nWhile crypto currency like Bitcoin is too volatile an asset to be presetly useful for completing property transactions, there are myriad ways the technology could be applied to property purchases. Here are some ways crypto could change how he sees the future of property sales and how the blockchain could be at its heart.\n\nDOES CRYPTO HAVE A PLACE IN THE FUTURE OF PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS?\n\nYes, blockchain technology will substantially impact the property market, enabled by blockchain technology, smart contracts and web3 applications. Of course the cryptocurrencies or tokens underlaying such ecosystems will play a pivotal role in the UK property market, as they already do in many markets worldwide.\n\nIS THERE DEMAND FROM BUYERS?\n\nThe space is still in its infancy stage and, due to the lack of regulation does not lend itself to transacting for anyone outside the space. There are virtually no examples of onchain property transactions at this stage outside of the metaverse. Bitcoin is (and certainly will be when fully mined) a storage of value \u2013 like digital gold \u2013 similar to actual gold nowadays. An on-chain property transaction would be like exchanging for another value like company shares or an artwork. These cases exist but are blips and don\u2019t provide a basis for the future vision of on-chain property transactions.\n\nRead more Florian Zeller interview: The Son director on fighting the shame of mental illness\n\nWHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS?\n\nIn the past five years I have seen compelling cases for deeds moving onto the blockchain via a sort of NFT protocol. A regulated crypto space could bring about added security and transparency as well as many efficiencies and cost reductions for the transaction process. The tokenization of assets brings benefits of co and micro-ownership and facilitates access to the property ladder for younger generations. Joint ownership (shared freehold or leasehold) structures could be managed via existing smart contract protocols and web3 ecosystems. This list of possible use cases down the line could be \u2018infinitely\u2019 extended.\n\nWHAT ARE THE DRAWBACKS?\n\nThe current major drawback is the infancy of space, the lack of transparency; volatility and regulation are one element but the complexity of the technology and difficulty to assess merit from fraudulent projects, adds to the current near irrelevance for property transactions in the real world. Blockchain technology can be compared to the internet revolution, the question is, are we in 1990 or 2000?"

        "title": "Convicted Nova Scotia murderer's stash of bitcoin at centre of wrongful death lawsuit - CTV News Atlantic",
        "content": "HALIFAX -\n\nA legal battle is brewing in Nova Scotia over access to bitcoin owned by an ex-medical student recently convicted of fatally shooting a fellow student during a drug deal.\n\nThe lawyer who represents the victim's family says the cryptocurrency could be worth more than $200,000 -- money that could be awarded to them if they win a wrongful death civil lawsuit.\n\nLast Saturday, a jury declared William Sandeson guilty of second-degree murder in the 2015 death of Taylor Samson, a 22-year-old physics student at Dalhousie University in Halifax. Sandeson admitted to disposing of the victim's body in the Bay of Fundy. Samson's remains have yet to be found.\n\nBefore his six-week trial began in Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Sandeson applied to the court to have his Dell laptop returned to him while he was in custody. In October 2022, Sandeson told the court his bitcoin account was worth between $8,000 and $10,000, but he said it had appreciated in value during his seven years in custody.\n\nAt the time of that court hearing, Sandeson said he needed the money to pay his legal team. He said he required physical possession of the computer to access the funds, adding that \"if the laptop is inoperable, the money is lost forever.\"\n\nSandeson will be sentenced in April.\n\nJames Goodwin, a lawyer who represents Samson's family, says the court approved Sandeson's request for the laptop. Goodwin, however, was granted an interim injunction blocking the move in December 2022. The court will revisit the issue in May.\n\nEarlier this month, Samson's mother, Linda Boutilier, and her other son, Connor Samson, filed an amended statement of claim for a wrongful death lawsuit against Sandeson.\n\nGoodwin said his clients are claiming special and general damages, and he said they want to make sure Sandeson's cryptocurrency remains available to the court if they win their civil case.\n\n\"The family is entitled to damages,\" Goodwin said in an interview from his office in Amherst, N.S. \"It's pretty rare for someone who commits homicide to have any assets at all.\"\n\nGoodwin said he was confident the court will keep the injunction in place, denying Sandeson access to the disputed account.\n\n\"Part of the test to get the injunction was to show evidence that this person isn't trustworthy,\" Goodwin said. \"He's admitting to (killing) somebody. He's changed his story repeatedly. There's a lot of evidence here of a character the court shouldn't trust.\"\n\nPolice seized the laptop at Sandeson's Henry Street apartment, which is where Samson was last seen alive. But the machine was never entered as an exhibit for Sandeson's trial.\n\nThe Crown argued it was reluctant to return the laptop until court proceedings ended because it contains text messages, internet searches, and information on websites that were accessed up to and including Aug. 15, 2015 -- the day Samson was murdered.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 24, 2023."
