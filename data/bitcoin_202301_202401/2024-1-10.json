        "title": "SEC approve new bitcoin funds - The Associated Press",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday reluctantly approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin, saying it is still deeply skeptical about cryptocurrencies and that its decision did not mean it approves or endorses bitcoin.\n\nThe SEC said it gave the green light to 11 exchange-traded funds for bitcoin even though it only faced a deadline for one application. The agency said that would provide competition and a \u201clevel playing field.\u201d\n\nBitcoin ETFs could open the door to cryptocurrencies to many new investors who don\u2019t want to take the extra steps involved in buying actual bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s a major win for Wall Street, particularly trillion-dollar fund managers like BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Invesco that have pushed hard to get the SEC to approve their applications. It\u2019s also a win for the cryptocurrency industry, which has needed a win after nearly two years of turmoil that has resulted in the failure of several crypto firms, most notably FTX in November 2022.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval, however, was lukewarm at best. Gary Gensler, the agency\u2019s chairman, has repeatedly said cryptocurrencies need more regulation and investor protections.\n\n\u201cInvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,\u201d Gensler said.\n\nOther commissioners expressed alarm that the SEC agreed to approve the funds.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that these products will flood the markets and land squarely in the retirement accounts of U.S. households who can least afford to lose their savings to the fraud and manipulation that appears prevalent in the spot bitcoin markets,\u201d Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw said in her dissent.\n\nAn exchange traded fund is an easy way to invest in assets or a group of assets, like gold, junk bonds or bitcoins, without having to directly buy the assets themselves. Cryptocurrency advocates hope the development thrusts the once niche and nerdy corner of the internet even further into the financial mainstream. ETFs can be purchased quickly with any brokerage and trade on an exchange like the Nasdaq stock market.\n\nThe regulatory greenlight has been anticipated for several months and the price of bitcoin has jumped about 70% since October as crypto investors speculated the broad use of bitcoin ETFs would drive up demand for the cryptocurrency. The price of etherium, the second-most popular cryptocurrency, has also risen on speculation that fund managers will create ETFs around it.\n\nSome analysts think that ETFs may help stabilize crypto prices by broadening their use and potential audience. But many remain concerned that broad use of crypto ETFs could put too much risk and volatility into Americans\u2019 retirement accounts.\n\n\u201cThe notorious price volatility of Bitcoin, as well as its fluctuating values against stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, could expose mainstream investors to a less familiar spectrum of investment risks,\u201d said Yiannis Giokas, senior director of Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\nIn a twist perhaps appropriate for the unpredictable crypto industry, a fake tweet from the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s account on X Tuesday stated that trading of bitcoin ETFs had been approved but the agency had not issued any approval.\n\nHere are some things to know about bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWHY ALL THE EXCITEMENT OVER A BITCOIN ETF?\n\nAn exchange traded fund, or ETF, is an easy way to invest in something or a group of things, like gold or junk bonds, without having to buy the things themselves. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs trade like stocks, which means they can be bought and sold throughout the day.\n\nSince the inception of bitcoin, anyone wanting to own one would have to buy it. That in turn would mean either having to learn what a cold wallet is or having to open an account at a crypto trading platform like Coinbase or Binance.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF could open the door to many new investors who don\u2019t want to take such extra steps.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has already soared in anticipation of the SEC\u2019s approval, with bitcoin trading at $45,890 Wednesday, up from around $27,000 in mid-October. The price had sunk as low as $16,000 in November of 2022 following the bankruptcy of the crypto exchange FTX.\n\nHOW WOULD THE ETF WORK?\n\nThe Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has already been trading since 2021, but it holds futures related to bitcoin, not the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nThe new bitcoin ETF will perform like the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), which allows anyone to invest in gold without having to find someplace to store a bar or having to protect it. It\u2019s the same reason some people invest in the SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (JNK), which lets investors simply buy one thing instead of the more than 1,000 low-quality bonds that make up the index.\n\nHOW MANY BITCOIN ETFS COULD THERE BE?\n\nThe SEC said it gave approval to 11 ETFs, but more are certain to apply for trading in the coming months.\n\nWHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES OF AN ETF?\n\nLongtime crypto fans might object. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were created in part due to mistrust of the traditional financial system. Wall Street would become an intermediary between investors and cryptocurrency in the case of ETFs.\n\nETFs also charge fees, though they tend to be relatively low compared with the overall financial industry. These fees are shown through what\u2019s called the expense ratio, which indicates how much of a fund\u2019s assets the ETF will take each year to cover its costs.\n\nWHEN IS IT BETTER TO HOLD ACTUAL BITCOIN?\n\nAn ETF will not put actual cryptocurrency into investors\u2019 accounts, meaning that they cannot use it. Also, an ETF would not provide investors with the same anonymity that crypto does, one of the big draws for many crypto investors.\n\nWHAT CONCERNS SHOULD INVESTORS HAVE?\n\nThe biggest concern for an investor in one of these ETFs is the notorious volatility in the price of bitcoin.\n\nDespite failing to catch on as a replacement for fiat, or paper, currencies, bitcoin soared near $68,000 in November of 2021. A year later it fell below $20,000 as investors in general shunned riskier assets and a series of company blowups and scandals shook faith in the crypto industry.\n\nEven as regulators and law enforcement crack down on some of cryptos bad actors, like Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX, the industry still has a modern \u201cWild West\u201d feel to it. The hack of the SEC\u2019s X account raises questions about both the ability of scammers to manipulate the price of bitcoin and SEC\u2019s own ability to stop them."

        "content": "Bitcoin ETFs could bring a flood of investments but also pose risks.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday gave its approval for some Bitcoin ETFs, just a day after a fake post on the agency's account on X made a similar announcement and sent the value of Bitcoin soaring.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin vaulted skyward on Tuesday afternoon after the SEC appeared to deliver a major breakthrough for the cryptocurrency.\n\nMinutes after the post went up Tuesday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler punctured the euphoria, saying on X that a hacker had commandeered the agency's account and sent out a fake message. The price of Bitcoin plummeted.\n\nSome analysts say Bitcoin ETFs -- Exchange-Traded Funds -- could bring tens of billions of dollars of investment this year and catapult the price of Bitcoin.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Gensler confirmed the decision but offered a note of caution about cryptocurrency.\n\nAfter announcing that the SEC had \"approved the listing and tradition\" of some Bitcoin ETFs, Gensler added: \"We did not approve or endorse bitcoin. Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\"\n\nA Bitcoin ETF allows investors to buy into an asset that tracks the price movement of Bitcoin, while avoiding the inconvenience and risk of purchasing the crypto coin itself. But critics warn the investment product could do harm to investors exposed to the volatility and uncertainty of crypto.\n\nHere's what to know about Bitcoin ETFs and what's at stake in their potential approval:\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF uses a decades-old trading method as a means of easing investment in digital assets.\n\nAn ETF amounts to a bucket of securities that gives investors a way to bet that an underlying asset will increase in price without purchasing that asset.\n\nFor instance, an ETF for gold allows individuals and institutions to put money on the price movement of the precious metal rather than buy, lug and store the physical item.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF, in turn, gives investors access to the cryptocurrency market without facing the technical impediments and fees associated with navigating a crypto exchange.\n\nTraders could find Bitcoin on traditional trading platforms and markets that many of them find trustworthy, assuaging concern about relatively young and scandal-ridden crypto technology.\n\nTop investment firms like Fidelity and BlackRock were set to offer Bitcoin ETF products once federal approval is given.\n\nWhile nearly 90% of U.S. adults say they've heard at least a little about cryptocurrency, three-quarters say they aren't confident about the safety and trustworthiness of current means for investing in the products, a Pew survey in April found.\n\nWhat will happen after Bitcoin ETFs are made available?\n\nSome analysts say the new products could unleash a flow of investment and trigger a major spike in the price of Bitcoin, supercharging the most well-known and successful digital asset.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF would elicit more than $14 billion of investment inflows within its first year on the market and nearly $40 billion by the end of the third year, according to Galaxy Digital, a crypto management and research firm.\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during afternoon trading, Jan. 9, 2024, in New York. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nStandard Chartered Bank, a U.K.-based lender, offered a more bullish assessment, saying the financial instrument could induce as much as $100 billion worth of inflows by the end of this year, crypto outlet CoinDesk reported on Tuesday.\n\nUnder such a scenario, the price of Bitcoin could reach near $200,000 by the end of 2025, more than quadrupling the current value of the crypto coin, Standard Chartered Bank said, according to CoinDesk.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has jumped nearly 70% over the past six months, in part due to anticipation of a surge if the Bitcoin ETF gains approval.\n\nCritics of the financial instrument, however, say it could wreak significant damage to investors due to the volatility of Bitcoin as well as its potential use in illicit activities.\n\nDennis Kelleher, the CEO of nonprofit transparency group Better Markets, co-authored a letter to an SEC official last week warning of significant risk posed by the pending approval.\n\n\"It would be a grave if not historic mistake almost certainly leading to massive investor harm if the SEC approves the pending rule changes,\" Kelleher wrote.\n\nHe added, \"The massive and unrelenting fraud and manipulation in the bitcoin market means that approving these products would expose those investors to the very harms that the SEC exists to prevent.\"\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nThe crypto industry entered this year bruised after a series of high-profile collapses and company scandals.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, formerly one of the industry's most prominent figures, could serve decades in prison after he was convicted on fraud charges in a federal trial. Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, faces a jail sentence of up to 18 months after he pleaded guilty to federal charges of money laundering.\n\nGovernment approval for a Bitcoin ETF injects a much-needed jolt of good news for the ailing sector. But, as some critics fear, the financial product could widen the reach of crypto and pose further risk.\n\n\"We believe retail investors should wait to see whether these products can garner enough traction to see the light of day -- let alone see convincing performance,\" Manan Agarwal and Sabeeh Ashhar, analysts with financial services firm Morningstar, wrote in August."

        "title": "SEC gives bitcoin ETFs the green light - CNN",
        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nAfter a false start Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission gave its approval Wednesday for some investment companies to offer \u201cspot bitcoin\u201d exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s highly anticipated move is expected to make bitcoin investing more accessible to Main Street investors, without requiring them to own the digital asset directly.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler made it clear in a statement on the SEC\u2019s website that the agency remains wary. \u201cWhile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin. Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe SEC had a deadline of January 10 to offer a decision for just one of the 11 firms that applied to offer bitcoin ETFs. On Wednesday it offered approval to all 11 of them.\n\nBitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has a current market cap of roughly $900 billion. It has seen volatile price swings throughout its 15-year history. Most recently, after hitting an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, it fell below $17,000 during the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d of 2022 and has mostly been trading north of $45,000 in the run-up to the SEC\u2019s decision.\n\nAbout an hour after the news Wednesday, the price of bitcoin was up 0.3%% to nearly $46,000, according to data on coinmarketcap.com.\n\nAfter the stock market close on Tuesday, a post on the SEC\u2019s X account falsely claimed the regulatory agency had approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.\n\nThat was quickly debunked by Gensler, and the SEC took down the message. According to X, an \u201cunidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number associated with the @SECGov account through a third party\u201d was responsible for the post. On Wednesday, the SEC said the FBI was looking into the matter.\n\nBitcoin ETFs, like bitcoin, carry risks for investors\n\nFor those considering jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon, it\u2019s important to note that the price of a bitcoin will be just as volatile whether you invest in it directly yourself or through an ETF.\n\nEarlier this week, Gensler posted a thread on X warning investors of the risks of crypto investing generally. \u201cInvestments in crypto assets also can be exceptionally risky & are often volatile. A number of major platforms & crypto assets have become insolvent and/or lost value. Investments in crypto assets continue to be subject to significant risk,\u201d his post read.\n\nThose sentiments have been echoed by many financial advisers and the investor watchdog group Better Markets, which strongly opposed the SEC\u2019s approval of bitcoin ETFs. Among its objections is the bitcoin market\u2019s history of artificially inflated trading volumes known as \u201cwash\u201d trading.\n\nIn a scathing statement following the SEC\u2019s announcement, the group\u2019s president and CEO Dennis Kelleher pulled no punches. \u201cWith the flagrantly lawless crypto industry crashing and burning due to a mountain of arrests, criminal convictions, bankruptcies, lawsuits, scandals, massive losses, and millions of investor and customer victims, who would have thought that the SEC would come to its rescue by approving a trusted and familiar investment vehicle that will enable the mass marketing of a known worthless, volatile, and fraud-filled financial product to Main Street Americans.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are many crypto advocates who are very pleased with the move. \u201cA spot Bitcoin ETF is a bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of crypto. Allowing investors to partake in the bitcoin journey without the technical hurdles of direct ownership is a significant step towards inclusivity,\u201d said Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation in an emailed statement.\n\nThe full list of companies that got SEC approval to launch bitcoin ETFs are: Ark Invest together with 21 Shares; Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Hashdex, Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie and VanEck. Some of their ETFs will be trading as soon as tomorrow."

        "content": "On January 10, 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of several BTC Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).[1] The approval order resolves the critical legal and regulatory issues entailed in launching a BTC ETF. Shares in trusts holding BTC can now be bought and sold on SEC-regulated exchanges, although other issues remain.\n\nIt may be that the SEC did this only because it was basically ordered to do so by three federal judges, and we note that its approval follows more than twenty disapprovals of other similar funds over the last six years.[2] But for once we see forward-looking progress rather than \u201cregulation by enforcement.\u201d\n\nJames Gorman, recently retired CEO and now Executive Chairman of Morgan Stanley, allows that Bitcoin has a role to play, albeit a \u201cvery small\u201d one, in a rich person\u2019s portfolio.[3] Meanwhile, Jamie Dimon, CEO and Chairman of JPMorgan Chase, has long held, to the contrary, that Bitcoin is \u201cworthless.\u201d[4] Between these two grand old men of traditional finance (TradFi), who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong about Bitcoin?\n\nAsked to decide, the SEC \u2013 to its credit \u2014 has decided not to decide. Rather, the SEC will let the markets decide. Specifically, the SEC will insist on full disclosure regarding Bitcoin ETFs, then let investors decide whether they want to invest.\n\nIn this piece, we explain how the stage for this development was set by Grayscale Investments\u2019 victory over the SEC in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Next, we explain what the SEC has now approved, and why. Then we comment on what\u2019s to come and what it all means.\n\nGrayscale Investments v. SEC\n\nThe SEC\u2019s order approving these BTC ETFs (Approval Order)[5] follows in the wake of Grayscale Investments\u2019 August 2023 victory in the D.C. Circuit, in which a unanimous court (appointed by Presidents from both parties) ruled that the SEC was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in rejecting Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a BTC ETF listed on NYSE Arca.[6] The SEC had approved applications for the listing of two ETFs based on BTC futures contracts. The court found these futures-based ETFs to be materially similar to Grayscale\u2019s BTC ETF such that they all should have received the same regulatory treatment. The court\u2019s decision turned on two elements: the underlying assets (BTC futures and BTC cash) being closely related and the exchanges being expected to have the same controls in place for detecting fraudulent or manipulative market misconduct.\n\nBitcoin is a commodity. Like other commodities, it trades both in cash markets and in futures markets. In the BTC cash market, cash is exchanged for BTC, with delivery expected speedily. In the futures market, cash is exchanged for a contract to buy or sell BTC at a predetermined price on a specific later date. The contracts are traded on a designated contract market, more commonly known as a futures exchange. For example, BTC futures contracts trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Again, the court found that the assets underlying each kind of ETF \u2013 the BTC futures ETF and the BTC ETF \u2014 were closely related.\n\nThe SEC had denied Grayscale\u2019s application \u2013 and more than twenty other applications to list a BTC ETF \u2013 on the ground that such a product is not \u201cdesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices\u201d as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).[7] In approving the two BTC futures ETFs, however, the SEC had found that each of them had satisfied legal requirements with a surveillance sharing agreement between the listing exchange and the CME.[8] The listing exchanges for Grayscale and for the BTC futures ETFs have identical surveillance sharing agreements with the CME. The court found, therefore, that there should be the same likelihood of detecting fraudulent or manipulative conduct in the market for BTC as in the market for BTC futures.\n\nThe Approval Order\n\nIn its Approval Order, the SEC approved the listing and trading of several BTC ETFs, marking a significant step in BTC\u2019s integration into TradFi markets. The ETFs that were approved by the Approval Order include the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, the VanEck Bitcoin Trust, the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, and the Franklin Bitcoin ETF.\n\nTo justify its conclusion, the SEC focused on the high correlation between spot BTC prices and CME BTC futures prices. The SEC relied on data submitted by applicants showing that the prices of spot BTC and of CME futures BTC have been highly correlated over the past 2.5 years.[9] From this, the SEC reasoned that manipulation in spot BTC markets would affect CME BTC futures prices and that CME surveillance would help detect any such manipulation. The SEC concluded that CME surveillance can effectively detect manipulation,[10] thereby justifying approval of the BTC ETFs.\n\nAs part of the Approval Order, the SEC accelerated the approval process of the applications, noting that the proposed rule changes to list and trade shares of BTC ETFs do not present novel regulatory issues. Notably, the SEC stated that the proposed rule changes to allow for the listing and trading of shares of BTC ETFs are consistent with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.[11]\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nThe Approval Order resolved the critical legal and regulatory issues entailed in launching a BTC ETF. Shares in trusts holding BTC can now be bought and sold on SEC-regulated exchanges, but other issues remain.\n\nCritically, there will be a brutal battle for market dominance. It is often the case in the ETF industry that the first mover precludes competition by gaining so much market share early on that no one else can get traction. It is unclear that such will be the case here. Even before the BTC ETFs were approved, sponsors were competing against one another by cutting prices. Price competition will likely continue. Other factors such as name brand recognition and commitment to the crypto asset industry \u2013 or to disruptive technologies more generally \u2013 might also prove important. Among investment banks, likewise, price will matter, but so too will market power, especially retail distribution. Because these are single-asset funds, analyst prowess would seem to be relatively unimportant.\n\nThe Approval Order covers BTC ETFs only. It does not cover ETH funds, AVAX funds, Solana funds, or any other possible single-crypto-asset funds, nor does it cover multiple-crypto-asset funds. All of these, however, are theoretically possible. In his separate statement, Chair Gensler reiterated his well-known opinion that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of crypto assets are securities. But the federal courts have sometimes disagreed with him.[12] And even when he is right, an ETF can be brought to market if the SEC staff is directed to work with the applicant to craft a structure that will fit within the law.\n\nWe are optimistic about the development of additional cash market ETFs, as well as derivative and futures products and competitive private funds. In the realm of public funds, of course, the sponsor will need to apply to the SEC for relief and work with an exchange to obtain relief, fitting within the existing literature (now including the Approval Order) or arguing persuasively for an extension of existing precedents.\n\nOur Perspective\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of BTC ETFs is historic because it has been sought by so many for so long and because the potential market for BTC ETFs is multiple trillions of dollars. BTC ETFs are not a new asset class. The ETF is a new (and possibly better) wrapper for an existing asset, which is BTC \u2013 the first and most dominant asset among the US$1.7 trillion class of crypto assets. BTC was doing fine before BTC ETFs were approved, having doubled yet again in the last twelve months, and it has spread globally.\n\nChair Gensler himself noted in his separate statement that the Approval Order does not \u201csignal anything about the Commissions views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws.\u201d The SEC has not changed course from its current positions regarding this asset class, but rather seems to have acknowledged the legal requirements that it treat like cases alike and let the market decide.\n\nThis SEC action is extremely encouraging. For one thing, it shows SEC obedience to the rule of law. Chair Gensler in his separate statement asserted twice that his SEC is \u201cmerit neutral,\u201d which is indeed its legally required perspective.[13]\n\nEven better from the viewpoint of technology innovation, this SEC action enables more of a United States retail market to develop for BTC, and probably other crypto assets, which until now has been foreclosed by administrative fiat. We will not be surprised if, years hence, crypto assets as an asset class have grown well beyond their current range and if this SEC action is viewed in hindsight as a watershed event because it enabled U.S. retail investors to buy, sell, and hold crypto assets in their IRAs, 401Ks, and brokerage accounts. That has been our experience with other financial innovations, including ETFs in particular.\n\nWe have been legal counsel for the structuring and regulatory approval of several pathbreaking ETFs, including the first foreign exchange funds and the first actively-managed fund. The ETF industry, which was alternately ridiculed and ignored in its infancy (like crypto), has grown since then to rival the larger mutual fund industry.\n\nSponsors and investment banks will now contend with one another to demonstrate to the United States retail investing public that their specific BTC ETF products, customer platforms, and prices are superior to their competitors\u2019 offerings and therefore deserve market acceptance. More sponsors and banks will probably seek market entry and gain it, at least on paper. From among many approved BTC ETF sponsors, only a few are likely to emerge victorious. But that is a commercial and market fight, not a legal and regulatory one.\n\nWe would be remiss were we not to remind readers \u2014 as in ending this paper we will do \u2014 that good governance by crypto-savvy, ETF-savvy officers and directors, and expert SEC legal advice by counsel, will all be necessary for sustainable market success in this industry. The digital assets industry is still a young and highly creative technology sector that is fraught with perils identified as legal and regulatory \u201crisk factors\u201d in several BTC ETF prospectuses.\n\nETFs are complex. Crypto assets are beyond complex. Sponsors and banks should not seek SEC approval for a crypto asset ETF, nor should a bank, broker, or RIA contract with a crypto asset ETF sponsor or authorized participant, unless led and advised by crypto-savvy, ETF-savvy officers, directors, and legal counsel. This is especially true for sponsors themselves, who need TradFi experience combined with DeFi experience on their boards and in their trenches.\n\n[1] In this paper, we generally refer to Bitcoin traded in the cash market by its ticker symbol, which is \u201cBTC.\u201d Exchange-traded funds or other exchange-traded products, all of which have many features of mutual funds but issue shares that trade on SEC-registered stock exchanges, are commonly referred to as \u201cETFs\u201d or \u201cETPs.\u201d An ETP whose portfolio is largely or entirely Bitcoin is referred to in this paper as a \u201cBTC ETF.\u201d\n\n[2] See Gensler, G. \u201cStatement on the Approval of Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Products,\u201d U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 10 January, 2024\n\n[3] See \u201cFormer Morgan Stanley CEO Says Bitcoin Is Not Going Away,\u2019\u201d CoinMarketCap, accessed 10 January 2024.\n\n[4] In an interview with FOX Business, Jamie Dimon reiterated his claim that BTC \u201cdoesn\u2019t have value\u201d even as JPMorgan Chase was named as an authorized participant in Blackrock\u2019s proposed BTC ETF.

        "title": "SEC's Approval of a Bitcoin Crypto ETF Is an Historic Mistake That Will Harm Investors, Markets, and Financial Stability - Better Markets",
        "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014 Dennis M. Kelleher, Co-founder, President, and CEO of Better Markets issued the following statement in response to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of a Bitcoin ETF:\n\n\u201cWith the flagrantly lawless crypto industry crashing and burning due to a mountain of arrests, criminal convictions, bankruptcies, lawsuits, scandals, massive losses, and millions of investor and customer victims, who would have thought that the SEC would come to its rescue by approving a trusted and familiar investment vehicle that will enable the mass marketing of a known worthless, volatile, and fraud-filled financial product to Main Street Americans. Bitcoin and crypto are worse than the chips you can buy at a casino because at least the casino is regulated; the spot Bitcoin market is not and that\u2019s what the ETF is going to be pricing. There will be no SEC regulation or policing of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake about it: the SEC\u2019s actions today are not required by or supported by the facts or law, including not required by the Grayscale court decision, as we spelled out in our comment letters here and here. The court in Grayscale merely said that the SEC failed to sufficiently explain its prior rejection. The SEC could \u2014 and should have \u2014 rejected the ETF applications and better detailed why it did so, importantly including a showing that \u201cas much as 77.5% of the total trading volume on unregulated exchanges was due to wash trading\u201d and as much as 95% of Bitcoin trading \u201ccould be due to wash trading.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this approval of a Bitcoin ETF is an historic mistake that will not only unleash crypto predators on tens of millions of investors and retirees but will also likely undermine financial stability. It will be interpreted and spun as a de facto SEC \u2013 if not U.S. government \u2013 endorsement of crypto generally. The crypto industry\u2019s marketing machinery can be expected to claim or imply that this decision legitimizes crypto as a safe and appropriate investment for hardworking Main Street retail investors and those saving for retirement. However, the SEC\u2019s action today has changed nothing about this worthless financial product : Bitcoin and crypto still have no legitimate use; remain the preferred product of speculators, gamblers, predators, and criminals; and continue to be cesspools of fraud, manipulation, and criminality.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the SEC\u2019s action, America\u2019s investors will have at least four levels of false comfort : first, the SEC\u2019s imprimatur; second, a well-known, trusted ETF investment vehicle; third, the involvement and legitimacy of traditional and trusted financial firms like Blackrock and Fidelity; and fourth, a belief that there will be meaningful regulation and investor protections.\n\n\u201cThe truth is there is and will be no effective cop on the Bitcoin beat. The CFTC is supposed to be the cop on that beat, but CFTC Chair Behnam has been little more than a biased crypto cheerleader rather than an independent financial regulator. While meeting with FTX\u2019s CEO Sam Bankman-Fried 10 times in just 14 months, Behnam prioritized expanding the crypto market and his agency\u2019s jurisdiction over the protection of the public. He was a \u201ckey ally\u201d to FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried and worked to deliver them regulatory and legislative victories. Even after FTX went bankrupt and $8 billion of customer funds were reportedly missing, he continued to push their top legislative priority in giving crypto jurisdiction to the smallest, least funded, and most easily capturable agency. However, even if the CFTC had a Chair that wanted to be a cop on the beat, the CFTC cannot be one because it has been and continues to be chronically and grossly underfunded.[1]\n\n\u201cAnother highly consequential result of this decision will be that crypto gets more interconnected with the core of the traditional financial and banking systems, which will dramatically increase the risk of systemic crashes and bailouts. That\u2019s why this decision is similar to the decision to deregulate derivatives in 2000, which led in just a few years to the catastrophic financial crash in 2008. History may well see this action as lighting the fuse of a crypto boom and what will almost certainly lead to a crypto bust with likely crashes, contagion and worse.\u201d\n\n###\n\nBetter Markets is a non-profit, non-partisan, and independent organization founded in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to promote the public interest in the financial markets, support the financial reform of Wall Street and make our financial system work for all Americans again. Better Markets works with allies\u2014including many in finance\u2014to promote pro-market, pro-business and pro-growth policies that help build a stronger, safer financial system that protects and promotes Americans\u2019 jobs, savings, retirements and more. To learn more, visit www.bettermarkets.org.\n\n[1] The CFTC\u2019s entire budget for 2023 was $365 million, and it had just 688 full-time employees. Its enforcement budget is just $67 million with 172 full-time employees, which it needs to police the multi-trillion-dollar derivatives and commodities markets in addition to the bitcoin market. That\u2019s why the unseemly bragging about its so-called enforcement record against \u201cdigital assets\u201d is more rhetoric than reality. They aren\u2019t fooling anyone, including the crypto industry which continues to push for legislation putting the CFTC in charge of regulating them. There is a reason they are spending tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars to buy the CFTC as their regulator."

        "content": "Federal regulators on Wednesday approved a new financial product that tracks the price of Bitcoin, a landmark moment for the cryptocurrency industry that proponents hope will increase investment in the technology.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission authorized 11 applications to offer exchange-traded funds tied to Bitcoin, a potentially simpler way for people to invest in digital assets. Some of the largest financial firms in the world, including the asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity, were approved to offer the products, known as E.T.F.s, which could begin trading as soon as Thursday on traditional platforms like the Nasdaq.\n\nThe approvals were hailed as a sign that mainstream financial institutions remain willing to deal in digital currencies even after 18 months of market crashes and high-profile bankruptcies. Since the fall, Bitcoin\u2019s price has surged more than 60 percent, as traders bet that approval of the new crypto products would give the industry an imprimatur of regulatory legitimacy, drawing fresh investment from professional wealth managers and amateur traders.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin shot up on Tuesday after a post appeared on the S.E.C.\u2019s official X account announcing the approval of the E.T.F.s, but dropped swiftly when Gary Gensler, the S.E.C. chair, said the agency\u2019s account had been hacked."

        "content": "Trading is set to begin for a new type of bitcoin fund that gives investors access to the crypto market without some of the hassle and fees of owning bitcoin outright.\n\nFreshly approved by federal regulators, bitcoin ETFs -- Exchange-Traded Funds -- allow investors to buy an asset that tracks the price movement of bitcoin.\n\nFidelity, BlackRock and a host of other top investment firms have already begun to offer the product.\n\nBitcoin ETFs promise major potential gains but also notable downsides, presenting investors with a wide range of outcomes that will test their tolerance for risk, analysts told ABC News.\n\nInvestors could capitalize on a possible rise in the price of bitcoin if a flood of money into Bitcoin ETFs vaults the cryptocurrency into mainstream markets, they said.\n\nHowever, investors should be prepared to weather the asset's considerable volatility as well as uncertainty stemming from its association with issues of fraud and mismanagement in the wider crypto industry, they added.\n\n\"It's going to be a volatile ride,\" Bryan Armour, the director of passive strategies research at financial firm Morningstar, told ABC News. \"You have to know that going in and make sure you're okay with that.\"\n\nSome analysts said the new products could unleash a flow of investment and trigger a major spike in the price of Bitcoin, supercharging the most well-known and successful digital asset.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF would elicit more than $14 billion of investment inflows within its first year on the market and as much as a 74% price increase over that period, Galaxy Digital, a crypto management and research firm, said in a report in October.\n\nSome traditional institutions outside of the crypto arena have echoed that optimism, at least to a degree. Deutsche Bank forecasted price increases for bitcoin this year due in part to \"greater institutional investment\" in Bitcoin ETFs, according to a report reviewed by ABC News.\n\nA run-up in price would follow some previous bull runs for bitcoin, including a rise of nearly 70% over the past six months. But the cryptocurrency has also undergone periods of major decline.\n\nThe price of bitcoin experienced a decline of at least 45 percentage points four times in the past five years, Armour said on Wednesday in a report for Morningstar.\n\nThe acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs among a wide swathe of investors could smooth out some of the volatility but that outcome may not come to pass, Armour told ABC News.\n\n\"If adoption becomes wider and the market becomes more mature, the price will become more stable,\" Armour said. \"For now, I don't see it stabilizing.\"\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler attends a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council at the U.S. Department of Treasury on December 14, 2023 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nSetting aside their volatility, Bitcoin ETFs carry risks posed by the uncertain effects of fraud and mismanagement within the crypto sector, some analysts said.\n\nThe crypto industry entered this year bruised after a series of high-profile collapses and company scandals.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, formerly one of the industry's most prominent figures, could serve decades in prison after he was convicted on fraud charges in a federal trial. Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, faces a jail sentence of up to 18 months after he pleaded guilty to federal charges of money laundering.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler affirmed the agency's decision to approve Bitcoin ETFs but offered a note of caution about cryptocurrency.\n\n\"We did not approve or endorse bitcoin,\" Gensler said. \"Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\"\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at digital asset management firm CoinShares, rebuked concerns about bitcoin tied to potential manipulation or fraud.\n\nThe green light to trade Bitcoin ETFs gives them the \"regulatory stamp approval,\" Butterfill said.\n\nUltimately, investors considering Bitcoin ETFs should consider the role a potentially risky asset should play in their wider portfolio, analysts said.\n\n\"You shouldn't allocate more to Bitcoin ETFs than you're willing to lose,\" Armour told ABC News.\n\nCallie Cox, an analyst at the investment company eToro who tracks cryptocurrencies, said each individual should weigh Bitcoin ETFs within his or her own financial goals.\n\n\"You have your own hopes and dreams for your portfolio, so you should see how it fits,\" Cox said."

        "title": "You can now invest in bitcoin ETFs. But should you? - CNN",
        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s official. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday gave the green light to the listing and trading of 11 bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. And they will be coming online quickly, with several starting to trade Thursday.\n\nThat means if you have have been curious about investing in bitcoin, you can do so in an SEC-regulated product, with fewer of the technical and cybersecurity risks that come with investing in it directly.\n\nBut before you jump on the bitcoin bandwagon, here are some things to think about.\n\nUnderstand what bitcoin is \u2026 and what it isn\u2019t\n\nIt\u2019s important to grasp what kind of asset bitcoin is.\n\nBitcoin is not tethered to anything tangible like the goods of a company or a natural resource.\n\nAnd it is not legal tender in the United States or most other countries. The US Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network characterizes it as \u201ca medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments.\u201d\n\nBut in the eyes of crypto advocates and some traditional money managers like Fidelity, it is a bet on the future of an increasingly digital world, and it\u2019s a bet that it will hold its value over time more than any other crypto currency because it is limited in number. Its creator designed it so that there will only be a finite number of bitcoin ever available.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is best understood as a monetary good\u2026 because bitcoin is the most (relative to other digital assets) secure, decentralized, sound digital money,\u201d Fidelity said in a recent report. \u201cAny other project or blockchain network that requires its users to believe they are transacting with a token that has real monetary value likely needs to be directly or indirectly connected to bitcoin as the ultimate monetary good.\u201d\n\nNew wrapper, many of the same risks\n\nBeing able to invest in bitcoin through an SEC-regulated exchange-traded fund may be appealing to some, given the lack of protections, backup and regulatory oversight for wallets and custodial crypto exchange accounts.\n\nFor instance, blockchain data researcher Chainanalysis reported that in 2023 digital wallet holders were scammed out of millions of dollars through a phishing scam that tricked them into giving scammers permission to spend the digital tokens in their wallets. The New York Times in 2021 had a report showing how crypto investors lost access to their crypto holdings because they forgot the codes to their digital wallets. And investors learned the hard way about the lack of consumer protections when crypto exchanges get into trouble, like the demise of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX.\n\nOne of the advantages of investing in an ETF of any kind, bitcoin included, is that you can house it at a registered broker-dealer that is a member of the nonprofit Securities Investor Protection Corporation and is therefore SIPC-insured. That means you will receive up to $500,000 of protection should your brokerage firm ever go bankrupt.\n\nIn addition, \u201cthe newly approved products [are trading] on established and trustworthy exchanges (CBOE, NASDAQ, and NYSE), which are generally more stable and secure than crypto exchanges. \u2026 [And] being able to access Bitcoin in an ETF format means investors can easily add it to a diversified portfolio and monitor it without needing a separate account,\u201d Alex Michalka, vice president of investment research at robo-advisory firm Wealthfront, said in an email.\n\nPlus, bitcoin ETFs will make it easier for financial advisers to access the cryptocurrency for their clients who can afford to invest in alternative asset classes.\n\nBut make no mistake, the price of a bitcoin will be just as volatile whether you invest in it directly yourself or through an ETF.\n\n\u201cOver the past 5 years, the volatility (in bitcoin) has been four times that of [the] stock market,\u201d said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar. \u201cThe exposure is the same. \u2026 It\u2019s still bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe price of bitcoin has fluctuated wildly over the years. For example, it hit an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, then fell below $17,000 during the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d of 2022 and has mostly been trading north of $45,000 in the run-up to the SEC\u2019s decision. On Thursday, it was around $46,000 at midday.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, cryptocurrency markets notoriously have been subject to price manipulation and criminal activities.\n\nBetter Markets, a nonprofit that advocates for, among other things, greater investor protections, strongly opposes the SEC\u2019s approval of bitcoin ETFs. Among its objections is the bitcoin market\u2019s history of artificially inflated trading volumes known as \u201cwash\u201d trading, which can make it appear that there is more investor interest than there actually is. And it remains unconvinced that the SEC\u2019s efforts to ensure more transparency in the bitcoin trading market, which it does not regulate, will provide adequate protection for ordinary investors.\n\nDeciding if a bitcoin ETF makes sense for you\n\nThe investment firms that have received approval to offer bitcoin ETFs are competing fiercely for investor dollars. All but one have proposed very low management and administrative fees and say they will waive their fees for several months.\n\nBut none of that should influence your decision about whether to invest in the first place. Your financial goals, risk tolerance and time horizon will be key factors in assessing whether it is worth it for you to put money in a bitcoin ETF.\n\nPut bluntly, \u201cIt\u2019s not for the faint of heart,\u201d Armour said. \u201cThere is no way to fundamentally value where it should be priced at. It\u2019s at the whim of supply and demand.\u201d\n\nOne certified financial planner, Alex Lozano, believes clients should only take as much risk as necessary on any investment to achieve their goals.\n\nGiven that a bitcoin ETF is likely to be considered a speculative investment, Lozano said, \u201cI would not recommend [it], unless [investors] had the ability to lose their investment or hold it for long periods of time.\u201d\n\nIf you do decide to invest in a bitcoin ETF, certified financial planner Trent D. Porter recommends making it no more than 3% of your overall portfolio. And if you normally invest on a platform that automatically rebalances your portfolio for you, make sure the system does not rebalance your holdings based on your bitcoin investment.\n\n\u201cEven a very small percentage in a bitcoin fund can cause a large amount of volatility in the overall portfolio,\u201d Porter said. \u201cAs an extreme example, if bitcoin were to fall to zero, an automated system would continue to rebalance into the fund until the entire portfolio was gone.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin devotees are declaring a historic victory after US regulators approved a new, more accessible way for people to invest in the crypto asset after a decade of resistance. Yet they won\u2019t go anywhere near it themselves.\n\nOn January 10, after a farcical false start, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the country. The ETFs will be issued by a selection of big-name financial institutions\u2014including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton\u2014and will give people a way to invest in bitcoin through a brokerage, as if it were a stock. The price of the ETF shares will follow the price of bitcoin.\n\nThe arrival of the new ETFs has been broadly celebrated by bitcoin investors, who believe they will legitimize the asset in the eyes of wealthy institutional investors and make it easier for laypeople to invest, thereby broadening demand and driving up the price. The inconvenient catch is that spot bitcoin ETFs are at odds with practically everything bitcoin is supposed to stand for.\n\nIn their 2008 white paper, bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, outlined a vision for electronic cash that changes hands directly from person to person, under the control of no financial institution. It was two fingers to profit-hungry Wall Street. Yet the ETFs will be issued by some of the largest financial institutions in the US. Nor do investors own or keep any actual bitcoin; they are buying a representation. ETF investors may stand to \u201cbenefit from the financial upside, but will not attain all the benefits that Satoshi envisioned,\u201d says Peter McCormack, host of podcast What Bitcoin Did. \u201cThe true ownership of bitcoin entails direct possession.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks after launch, hundreds of millions of dollars are expected to flood into spot bitcoin ETFs. The result will effectively be a bifurcation of the asset into a form of bitcoin for investment and a bitcoin for bitcoin\u2019s sake\u2014held only by ideologues.\n\nTo explain the dissonance between the celebratory reception to the new ETFs and their blatant incompatibility with the Nakamoto ethos, bitcoiners point to the difficulty in achieving widespread adoption to date. The ETFs are a calculated compromise, they say, that addresses the unwillingness of regular people to deal with the perils of storing crypto themselves."

        "content": "A California man who lost $100,000 in a 2021 SIM-swapping attack is suing the unknown holder of a cryptocurrency wallet that harbors his stolen funds. The case is thought to be the first in which a federal court has recognized the use of information included in a bitcoin transaction \u2014 such as a link to a civil claim filed in federal court \u2014 as reasonably likely to provide notice of the lawsuit to the defendant. Experts say the development could make it easier for victims of crypto heists to recover stolen funds through the courts without having to wait years for law enforcement to take notice or help.\n\nRyan Dellone, a healthcare worker in Fresno, Calif., asserts that thieves stole his bitcoin on Dec. 14, 2021, by executing an unauthorized SIM-swap that involved an employee at his mobile phone provider who switched Dellone\u2019s phone number over to a new device the attackers controlled.\n\nDellone says the crooks then used his phone number to break into his account at Coinbase and siphon roughly $100,000 worth of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, which alleges the company ignored multiple red flags, and that it should have detected and stopped the theft. Coinbase did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWorking with experts who track the flow of funds stolen in cryptocurrency heists, Dellone\u2019s lawyer Ethan Mora identified a bitcoin wallet that was the ultimate destination of his client\u2019s stolen crypto. Mora says his client has since been made aware that the bitcoin address in question is embroiled in an ongoing federal investigation into a cryptocurrency theft ring.\n\nMora said it\u2019s unclear if the bitcoin address that holds his client\u2019s stolen money is being held by the government or by the anonymous hackers. Nevertheless, he is pursuing a novel legal strategy that allows his client to serve notice of the civil suit to that bitcoin address \u2014 and potentially win a default judgment to seize his client\u2019s funds within \u2014 without knowing the identity of his attackers or anything about the account holder.\n\nIn a civil lawsuit seeking monetary damages, a default judgment is usually entered on behalf of the plaintiff if the defendant fails to respond to the complaint within a specified time. Assuming that the cybercriminals who stole the money don\u2019t dispute Dellone\u2019s claim, experts say the money could be seized by cryptocurrency exchanges if the thieves ever tried to move it or spend it.\n\nThe U.S. courts have generally held that if you\u2019re going to sue someone, you have to provide some kind of meaningful and timely communication about that lawsuit to the defendant in a way that is reasonably likely to provide them notice.\n\nNot so long ago, you had track down your defendant and hire someone to physically serve them with a copy of the court papers. But legal experts say the courts have evolved their thinking in recent years about what constitutes meaningful service, and now allow notification via email.\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2023, a federal judge in the Eastern District of California granted Dellone permission to serve notice of his lawsuit directly to the suspected hackers\u2019 bitcoin address \u2014 using a short message that was attached to roughly $100 worth of bitcoin Mora sent to the address.\n\nBitcoin transactions are public record, and each transaction can be sent along with an optional short message. The message uses what\u2019s known as an \u201cOP RETURN,\u201d or an instruction of the Bitcoin scripting language that allows users to attach metadata to a transaction \u2014 and thus save it on the blockchain.\n\nIn the $100 bitcoin transaction Mora sent to the disputed bitcoin address, the OP RETURN message read: \u201cOSERVICE \u2013 SUMMONS, COMPLAINT U.S. Dist. E.D. Cal. LINK: t.ly/123cv01408_service,\u201d which is a short link to a copy of the lawsuit hosted on Google Drive.\n\n\u201cThe courts are adapting to the new style of service of process,\u201d said Mark Rasch, a former federal prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice. \u201cAnd that\u2019s helpful and useful and necessary.\u201d\n\nRasch said Mora\u2019s strategy could force the government to divulge information about their case, or else explain to a judge why the plaintiff shouldn\u2019t be able to recover their stolen funds without further delay. Rasch said it could be that Dellone\u2019s stolen crypto was seized as part of a government asset forfeiture, but that either way there is no reason Uncle Sam should hold some cybercrime victims\u2019 life savings indefinitely.\n\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t need the crypto as evidence, but in a forfeiture action the money goes to the government,\u201d Rasch said. \u201cBut it was never the government\u2019s money, and that doesn\u2019t help the victim. The government should be providing information to the victims of cryptocurrency theft so that their attorneys can go get the money back themselves.\u201d\n\nNick Bax is a security researcher who specializes in tracing the labyrinthine activity of criminals trying to use cryptocurrency exchanges and other financial instruments to launder the proceeds of cybercrime. Bax said Mora\u2019s method could allow more victims to stake legitimate legal claims to their stolen funds.\n\n\u201cIf you get a default judgment against a bitcoin address, for example, and then down the road that bitcoin gets sent to an exchange that complies with or abides by U.S. court orders, then it\u2019s yours,\u201d Bax said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen funds with a court order on them get frozen by the exchanges that decided it made sense to comply with orders from a U.S. federal court.\u201d\n\nBax\u2019s research was featured in a Sept. 2023 story here about how experts now believe it\u2019s likely hackers are cracking open some of the password vaults stolen in the 2022 data breach at LastPass.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to a lot victims who have had life-changing amounts of money being seized and would like that money back,\u201d Bax said. \u201cA big goal here is just making civil cases more efficient. Because then people can help themselves and they don\u2019t need to rely solely on law enforcement with its limited resources. And that\u2019s really the goal: To scale this and make it economically viable.\u201d\n\nWhile Dellone\u2019s lawsuit may be the first time anyone has obtained approval from a federal judge to use bitcoin to notify another party of a civil action, the technique has been used in several recent unrelated cases involving other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and NFTs.\n\nThe law firm DLAPiper writes that in November 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida \u201cauthorized service of a lawsuit seeking the recovery of stolen digital assets by way of a non-fungible token or NFT containing the text of the complaint and summons, as well as a hyperlink to a website created by the plaintiffs containing all pleadings and orders in the action.\u201d\n\nIn approving Dellone\u2019s request for service via bitcoin transaction, the judge overseeing the case cited a recent New York Superior Court ruling in a John Doe case brought by victims seeking to unmask the crooks behind a $1.3 million cyberheist.\n\nIn the New York case, the state trial court found it was acceptable for the plaintiffs to serve notice of the suit via cryptocurrency transactions because the defendants regularly used the Blockchain address to which the tokens were sent, and had recently done so. Also, the New York court found that because the account in question contained a significant sum of money, it was unlikely to be abandoned or forgotten.\n\n\u201cThus the court inferred the defendants were likely to access the account in the future,\u201d wrote Judge Helena M. March-Kuchta, for the Eastern District of California, summarizing the New York case. \u201cFinally, the plaintiff had no alternative means of contacting these unknown defendants.\u201d\n\nExperts say regardless of the reason for a cryptocurrency theft or loss \u2014 whether it\u2019s from a romance scam or a straight-up digital mugging \u2014 it\u2019s important for victims to file an official report both with their local police and with the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (ic3.gov). The IC3 collects reports on cybercrime and sometimes bundles victim reports into cases for DOJ/FBI prosecutors and investigators.\n\nThe hard truth is that most victims will never see their stolen funds again. But sometimes federal investigators win minor victories and manage to seize or freeze crypto assets that are known to be associated with specific crimes and criminals. In those cases, the government will eventually make an effort to find, contact and in some cases remunerate known victims.\n\nIt might take many years for this process to unfold. But if and when they do make that effort, federal investigators are likely to focus their energies and attention responding to victims who staked a claim and can support it with documentation.\n\nBut have no illusions that any of this is likely to happen in a timeframe that is meaningful to victims in the short run. For example, in 2013 the U.S. government seized the assets of the virtual currency Liberty Reserve, massively disrupting a major vehicle for laundering the proceeds of cybercrime and other illegal activities.\n\nWhen the government offered remuneration to Liberty Reserve account holders who wished to make a financial loss claim and supply supporting documentation, KrebsOnSecurity filed a claim. There wasn\u2019t money much in my Liberty Reserve account; I simply wanted to know how long it would take for federal investigators to follow up on my claim, or indeed if they would at all.\n\nIn 2020 KrebsOnSecurity was contacted by an investigator with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) who was seeking to discuss my claim. The investigator said they would have called sooner, but that it had taken that long for the IRS to gain legal access to the funds seized in the 2013 Liberty Reserve takedown."

        "content": "Potential pros of spot bitcoin ETPs\n\nMay make crypto more accessible to the public\n\nThose new to crypto can find it hard to understand the details behind buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Which platform should I use to buy crypto? Was my purchase recorded on the blockchain? Where are the coins I just bought stored? These questions can be daunting for first-timers.\n\nThen, once you\u2019ve made your purchase, there are financial planning considerations that differ from those of traditional assets. For example, when it comes to reporting taxes for traditional assets, your gains and losses can often be synced to tax preparation software with a single click through your brokerage platform. Reporting crypto taxes, however, may require uploading documents to your tax preparation software, as the ability to sync seamlessly with platforms offering crypto may not yet exist. Apart from taxes, there are also unique steps necessary for fitting crypto into your estate plan.\n\nThese factors may make those who are unfamiliar with crypto\u2019s nuances hesitant to invest. They can also make it harder for financial advisors to incorporate crypto into an investment plan for clients.\n\nBuying spot bitcoin ETPs, however, operates much like buying an index fund or sector ETF. Investors can complete everything through more traditional routes, including brokerage accounts, IRAs, and trusts, which simplifies many of the questions above. Tax and estate planning considerations may also be simpler to manage through this route.\n\nNote: Despite the potential advantages, remember that spot bitcoin ETPs hold bitcoin as their underlying asset. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and may be more susceptible to market manipulation than other securities.\n\nNevertheless, in general, the ETPs remove significant hurdles for investors who want exposure to bitcoin.\n\nMay have fewer security considerations compared to buying bitcoin\n\nThose who aren\u2019t familiar with the nuances of crypto cybersecurity may also find it confusing to learn how to keep their bitcoin secure. Protecting your bitcoin requires knowing the difference between hot and cold wallets, ways to avoid scams, features of reliable custodians, and other best practices.\n\nThese aspects are critical knowledge for bitcoin owners because there is no central customer service team in crypto. If you\u2019re hacked or scammed, or if the crypto exchange you\u2019re storing your coins on collapses, you may lose access to your investments forever.\n\nFor those who have been hesitant about buying crypto because of these risks, spot bitcoin ETPs are an alternative that potentially comes with fewer of these risks. With the ETP, you only need to protect the login to your financial platform, rather than learn and manage multiple cybersecurity nuances. However, note that you are still trusting that the ETP issuer is managing these cybersecurity nuances effectively.\n\nAdditionally, ETPs in general are subject to certain regulatory oversight from government agencies. This contrasts with the crypto market, which is currently less regulated. Some investors may feel more confident buying an asset that is subject to regulation."

Approved applicants for bitcoin ETFs include Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Hashdex, BZX, VanExk, WisdomTree, and Franklin.\n\nApplications for bitcoin ETFs first popped up in 2013, but had been repeatedly rejected by the SEC up until now.\n\nTrading can begin as early as tomorrow, January 11, 2024, with over a dozen bitcoin ETF applicants \u2014 including Fidelity, BlackRock, Grayscale, Ark Investments, and 21Shares \u2014 eager to launch new products.\n\n\"We've fought with the SEC for ages, and they have been really slow in accepting the cryptocurrency market,\" says Stuart John Barton, CFP and co-founder of Volatility Shares. \"The SEC has lost enough battles and is now realizing they may have been leaning too conservative and need to loosen up. The SEC should be working with the investment community to improve products and make them better, not just stand in the way of innovation.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about bitcoin ETFs.\n\nInvest in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether, and more with some of the best cryptocurrency exchanges. The best crypto trading platforms offer advanced chart tools, real-time market data, low trading fees, and account flexibility.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nA bitcoin ETF, not to be confused with a bitcoin futures ETF, is an exchange-traded fund that can directly hold bitcoin among other investable securities. Unlike bitcoin itself, which can only be bought and sold along the blockchain, bitcoin ETFs can be traded by retail investors through regular brokerage accounts.\n\n\"It opens the crypto market up to a broader world. Over time, we're likely to see a maturing market with more people trading and buying bitcoin,\" says Barton, \"In a more general sense, it just simplifies the process as most Americans have brokerage accounts. That means pretty much everybody has access to bitcoin ETFs.\"\n\nAlthough bitcoin futures ETFs were first introduced on the NYSE back in 2021, investors still haven't been able to invest directly in bitcoin through an ETF until today. But with bitcoin ETFs, people can more easily mitigate risk, simplify the investing process, and increase overall portfolio diversification.\n\nA bitcoin ETF doesn't have to just hold bitcoin, either. Just like any other exchange-traded fund, bitcoin ETFs can be a combination of crypto, stocks, bonds, and other commodities. Bitcoin ETFs, therefore, provide an easy way for investors to diversify their portfolios further.\n\nAdvantages of bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe launch of bitcoin ETFs could change the game of crypto trading by granting retail investors a more accessible means of exposure to the crypto world. Plus, ETFs are one of the most affordable ways to decrease volatility through portfolio diversification.\n\nInvesting in bitcoin through an ETF is now the simplest, least-risky way to get exposure to the crypto market. Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, and the market, in general, has been riddled with fraudulent activity and scams. However, more investors can get involved in the cryptocurrency market by being regulated by the SEC and trading on the traditional exchange.\n\nThat said, it's important to note that investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (even through an ETF) is still risky. Making bitcoin accessible through an ETF won't eliminate its hyper-volatile nature. So, only investors with a high-risk tolerance should invest in bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBarton theorizes how the bitcoin ETF may impact how bitcoin is traded down the line. \"Bitcoin ETFs are more investment-based than bitcoin futures ETFs are. I believe bitcoin ETFs will be more aimed at people who will put money in and leave it in there for a few years. If that's the case, we might actually see a reduction in the volatility of the bitcoin itself.\"\n\nWhere to invest in bitcoin ETFs\n\nLike most regulated securities on the market, you can invest in bitcoin ETFs through some of the best online brokerages and investment platforms. Dozens of platforms have already submitted applications to the SEC to begin trading bitcoin ETFs, and 11 have been approved so far, including Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Hashdex, BZX, VanExk, WisdomTree, and Franklin.\n\nFidelity, one of the most popular brokerages out there, has already posted several of its proposed bitcoin ETFs on its site. There are sure to be quite a few more brokers and popular cryptocurrency exchanges jumping on the opportunity to offer bitcoin ETFs to their users in the next few weeks.\n\nIf you're interested in investing in cryptocurrencies but don't know where to start, you can always consult with a financial advisor with crypto trading experience for professional insight."

        "content": "As of Thursday morning, the Securities Exchange Commission has approved 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The move is widely expected to bring more legitimacy to an industry marred by the recent collapse of cryptocurrency exchanges. Several large investment firms had filed applications for ETFs with the SEC, including BlackRock, ARK Invest, Invesco and Fidelity Investments. The approved ETFs have already begun trading Thursday on traditional SEC-regulated exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. An ETF is an investment fund that tracks the price of an underlying asset or index, much like a mutual fund, and can be bought and sold through a brokerage account.\n\n\n\nFor investors, \"an ETF might be perceived as safer than a direct investment through crypto exchanges,\" says Marcel Miu, a certified financial planner and founder of Simplify Wealth Planning. \"This is primarily due to the regulatory oversight governing ETFs \u2014 they are subject to the regulatory standards of financial markets that can offer a layer of security and transparency not always present in the crypto space.\"\n\nWhat this means for you\n\nAs a result of the approvals, investors can now buy ETFs through their existing brokerage accounts instead of dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges. Plus, they don't need to own crypto directly to have a stake in the market. In the past few weeks, the price of bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies has risen in anticipation of a new crop of potential buyers. However, the price of bitcoin tumbled on Tuesday after the SEC said that an announcement posted to X about bitcoin ETFs being approved was incorrect. As of late Thursday morning, bitcoin's price has regained those losses. Still, that doesn't change the risky nature of cryptocurrencies, which are highly speculative assets. \"Investing in a bitcoin ETF carries risks, similar to investing in cryptocurrencies directly,\" says Miu. \"The value of bitcoin can be highly volatile, influenced by factors such as regulatory news, technological developments and market sentiment.\" Indeed, bitcoin lost more than 75% of its value following the collapse of FTX in 2022, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges at the time. Although it has since bounced back, it remains volatile, with 5% to 10% daily price swings common.\n\nShould you invest in a bitcoin ETF?"

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday granted approval to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, backed by Wall Street, a key regulatory step that will make it easier for ordinary investors to put their money into the digital currency.\n\nThe agency gave the green light to multiple financial firms to offer spot bitcoin ETFs, including asset management giants like BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Franklin Templeton that cater to retail investors.\n\nUntil now, only bitcoin futures ETFs had SEC approval. Bitcoin prices have shot up on the SEC's approval of the ETFs, more than doubling since last year, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index shows. Prices for the cryptocurrency had already risen 61% since October on expectations that the agency planned to approve spot ETF applications, CoinDesk reported.\n\nHere's what to know about spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhat's an ETF?\n\nETFs are pooled investments, like a mutual fund, but that trade on stock exchanges like a stock or bond and that track a specific index, sector or asset class such as gold. Unlike traditional mutual funds, they can be bought and sold throughout the day.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF. Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.\n\nWhich ETF applications were approved?\n\nThe SEC has approved the following 11 spot bitcoin ETFs:\n\nBlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF Bitwise Bitcoin ETP Trust WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust VanEck Bitcoin Trust Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund Hashdex Bitcoin ETF Franklin Bitcoin ETF\n\nWhen will spot bitcoin ETFs start trading?\n\nNearly a dozen new bitcoin funds have already begun trading in U.S. markets. Trading began on Thursday, with buying and selling for at least one ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, kicking off as early as 4 a.m. Eastern Time, cryptocurrency trade publication CoinDesk reported.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs vs. buying bitcoin: What's the difference?\n\nInvesting in spot bitcoin ETFs differs from buying bitcoin directly in a few ways.\n\nFirst, investors who put money into bitcoin ETFs do not own any bitcoin outright, Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, told CBS MoneyWatch. Second, financial firms will charge fees for trading and managing a bitcoin ETF. By contrast, people who buy bitcoin directly pay a transaction fee, but there are no costs for managing the investment.\n\nThere are some advantages to owning bitcoin through an ETF. For example, investors can hold and track their bitcoin ETF in the same brokerage account as their other investments.\n\nWhat could be the impact of the SEC approving bitcoin ETFs?\n\nInvestors are betting that the emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs will pump billions of dollars into the digital currency by making it easier and less intimidating to invest.\n\nFirms like BlackRock and Fidelity are household names in financial services, and their move to enter the sector nudges bitcoin further into the mainstream as an investment class while conferring legitimacy to the shadowy and highly volatile crypto industry.\n\n\"A spot Bitcoin ETF marks the end of crypto as a 'novel' asset class and the beginning of a world where it can be part of every portfolio,\" said Nathan McCauley, CEO of Anchorage Digital, a crypto platform provider for financial firms.\n\nAnd as demand for bitcoin rises, so too will its price, likely spurring even more investment and interest in crypto, experts say. Boosting investment in bitcoin, coupled with the introduction of new products from reputable financial players, could also accelerate passage of sensible regulations aimed at eliminating fraud and normalizing crypto as a way to invest, make payments and more generally conduct business.\n\nStrengthening the regulatory framework for crypto is vital, according to Rajeev Bamra, senior vice president of Digital Finance at Moody's Investors Service.\n\n\"Whether this trend will hold depends on the trajectory of global monetary policymaking as well as the availability of cryptocurrencies to institutional investors through products that meet regulatory standards, ensuring their safety and security,\" he said."

But the wild market reaction may serve as a preview of the S.E.C.\u2019s actual decision on those Bitcoin products, which is expected today.\n\nFor 15 minutes, the crypto community was euphoric. At 4:11 p.m. Eastern, the @SECGov account on the platform X said that the S.E.C. had approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, investment products tied directly to the price of the digital currency.\n\nThe crypto community has been eagerly awaiting that announcement, because such products \u2014 including those proposed by investment giants like BlackRock and Fidelity \u2014 could help make buying into Bitcoin easier for mainstream audiences. (The exchange Coinbase, for instance, posted a celebratory banner.) Investors plowed money into Bitcoin, with its price rising 2.5 percent to a weeklong high of $47,893 on the post."

The spot bitcoin ETFs are expected to begin trading on Thursday.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs will help make investing in the cryptocurrency more accessible, bringing more investors and assets into the crypto space.\n\nSpot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are cleared to begin trading Thursday after receiving regulatory approval on Wednesday from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs Approved\n\nThe regulator gave the green light to the following products:\n\nARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB)\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC)\n\nFranklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC)\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)\n\nHashdex Bitcoin ETF (DEFI)\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO)\n\niShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL)\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW)\n\n\n\nIn a bid to appeal to investors, many issuers slashed and offered waivers to their spot bitcoin ETF fees ahead of the SEC nod.\n\nA Long Wait for Spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nIt has been a long road for the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the United States. The journey began in 2013 when an entity affiliated with the Winklevoss twins sent the first application for such a financial product to the SEC.\n\nWhile that application was eventually rejected, bitcoin ETFs based on futures products were eventually approved by the SEC starting in 2021. Up until now, a large number of spot-based bitcoin ETF applications had been rejected on the grounds that bitcoin's unregulated nature creates too much risk for investors. Crypto asset manager Grayscale eventually sued the SEC to force more clarity on the matter.\n\nHowever, it was Blackrock's (BLK) application for a spot bitcoin product in June last year that gathered momentum behind the idea. As the investment giant from traditional finance stepped into the arena, many others such as Fidelity and Franklin Templeton followed suit. This was seen as a sign that regulatory approval was on the way due to the firms' pivotal role in the U.S. financial system.\n\nWhile regulators and issuers went back and forth to iron out details, there were some last-minute glitches. An unauthorized post announcing the approval on social media platform X from the SEC's account on Tuesday sent bitcoin prices soaring past $48,000 before the regulator clarified that its X account had been compromised.\n\nWhat This Regulatory Approval Means for Bitcoin\n\nThe SEC's sign-off serves as a significant regulatory seal of approval for the world's largest crypto asset, likely reducing some investor fears about investing in the space. It not only brings more regulatory safeguards but allows investors to invest with well-established financial firms. But SEC Chair Gensler warned investors to consider risks before putting their money into the product.\n\n\"While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin. Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,\" said Gensler in a statement.\n\nUntil now, retail investors have only been able to gain cryptocurrency exposure by buying coins directly or through ETFs that trade in cryptocurrency futures. A spot bitcoin ETF will allow investors, especially retail investors, to gain access to bitcoin without needing to hold their investment in a bitcoin wallet. Instead, they simply hold the ETFs in their brokerage account.\n\n\n\nAnalysts expect significant amounts of money to flow into bitcoin spot ETFs, and that optimism has helped boost the price of bitcoin substantially in recent months.\n\nAccording to estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence, the spot bitcoin ETF market could grow to $100 billion over time. Financial services provider Galaxy estimates inflows in spot bitcoin ETF products could rise from $14 billion in the first year to $39 billion within three years.\n\nUpdate\u2014Jan. 10, 2024: This article was updated to add comments from the SEC."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs Have Arrived. Here's Who Stands to Get Rich - WIRED",
        "content": "US regulators have approved a new breed of financial product that will give people a way to invest in bitcoin through their brokerage for the first time, as if it were a regular stock.\n\nA selection of financial institutions, including household names like BlackRock and Fidelity, have been given permission by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), whose value tracks the price of bitcoin. The approval comes after a peculiar incident on January 9, in which a hijacker used the agency's X account to announce the ETFs prematurely, leading to market chaos and forcing the SEC to publish a retraction.\n\nThe arrival of the spot bitcoin ETFs has been celebrated among investors as a source of new demand for the asset\u2014now available in a more accessible format\u2014that could push up the price. Yet a significant portion of the financial upside will be captured behind the scenes, not in the open market.\n\nThe ETF issuers will take a management fee, as a percentage of the sum people invest. One layer deeper, though, another subset of companies\u2014intermediaries that provide the plumbing necessary for a spot bitcoin ETF to function\u2014stand to earn big. These firms are responsible for storing bitcoin on behalf of the issuers, as appointed custodians, or creating new ETF shares and cashing in existing ones, in the case of authorized participants, or APs. The job of another set of third parties, market makers, is to help price ETFs accurately and ensure that trades run smoothly in the public market.\n\nThe pool of firms that perform these trading-related functions is limited, says James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, partly because of the amount of cash required to deal with large quantities of assets flowing in and out the door. With respect to custody, the Venn diagram of willing and qualified candidates is restricted further by the challenges of handling bitcoin, which sits on entirely different technical rails than regular shares. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different area,\u201d says Seyffart.\n\nAs such, the spot bitcoin ETF issuers will share a small group of service providers, at least at launch. Between them, crypto exchanges Coinbase and Gemini will provide custody services for practically all the new ETFs. Only JPMorgan, Cantor Fitzgerald, Virtu Financial, and Jane Street, all multinational financial services firms, have signed on as APs to date."

        "content": "Key Takeaways 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved yesterday will start trading today.\n\nThe ETFs will be listed on three different exchanges NYSE Arca, Cboe BZX and Nasdaq.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs will make it easier for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin as they can trade the ETF through their brokerage account.\n\nMultiple bitcoin ETFs hitting the market today sparked a fee war among issuers, with each trying to entice investors with waivers and fee reductions.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ended months of speculation this week by approving the first-ever spot market Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Here's what you need to know about the ETFs that can start trading from Today.\n\n\n\n1) Which new bitcoin ETFs start trading today and where?\n\nThe SEC has approved eleven new ETFs that will be listed on the NYSE Arca, Cboe BZX, and Nasdaq exchanges. The following is a list of the ETFs trading on each exchange and their tickers:\n\nNYSE Arca will list and trade shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), and the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF (DEFI). DEFI currently trades as a bitcoin futures ETF and received approval to convert to a spot product, but Hashdex corrected an initial announcement to clarify that the change in name and investment strategy will occur at a later date.\n\nCboe BZX will list and trade shares of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL), the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC).\n\nNasdaq will list and trade shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR).\n\n2)How does a Bitcoin ETF work?\n\nWhen you buy a share of an ETF, you are buying into a basket of securities that the ETF holds in its portfolio\u2014in this case it's bitcoin. The value of your investment will correlate to the change in bitcoin prices.\n\nUsing BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust as an example, the ETF will be listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Pricing of the ETF will be calculated daily using the CF CME Bitcoin Reference Rate, which \u201caggregates\" the notional value of bitcoin trading across major bitcoin spot exchanges.\n\n3)How can I trade Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nTrading bitcoin in the new ETFs will be easier than buying the cryptocurrency directly on exchanges. Investors can simply buy and sell shares in the new funds via their current brokerage account.\n\nBuying bitcoin (BTCUSD) directly involves the use of a Hot or Cold storage wallet and the requirement to maintain the private and public keys, which are cryptographic strings of letters and numbers required to make crypto transfers from your wallet. The complicated storage and the lack of SEC regulation on the exchanges were seen as a major deterrent to retail and institutional adoption of BTC.\n\n4)Are there fees involved?\n\nTrading in ETFs involves a fee but the imminent approval of a large number of new funds has sparked competition among providers. The new bitcoin investment vehicles will see lower fees and waivers for the first months of trading.\n\nBitwise said it would levy a 0.20% management fee for its spot bitcoin ETF, compared with the 0.37% average for current U.S. ETF products in 2022. VanEck's set its expense ratio at 0.25% while ARK Invest's 21Shares planned 0.21% fees. The world's largest asset manager BlackRock is set to charge 0.25%.\n\n\n\nEarly investors can also benefit as Bitwise said it will waive fees on the first $1 billion invested for the first six months. Ark also announced a fee waiver for six months or the first billion dollars invested whichever occurs first. BlackRock set a waiver period of 12 months or the first $5 billion invested.\n\nCorrection\u2014Jan. 11, 2024: This article was updated to reflect the correction and clarification from Hashdex.\n\n"

Major financial firms, including asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, are offering the E.T.F.s.\n\nThe early volume was impressive, analysts said, comparing favorably with other E.T.F. debuts. But it may take months to gauge the impact on the cryptocurrency industry, which is still reeling from a recent series of market crashes and high-profile corporate bankruptcies.

        "content": "Chesnot | Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved rule changes to allow the creation of bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., a long-awaited move that will give regular investors access to the controversial and volatile cryptocurrency. The decision will likely lead to the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which holds about $29 billion of the cryptocurrency, into an ETF, as well as the launch of competing funds from mainstream issuers such as BlackRock's iShares and Fidelity. The first funds are poised to begin trading Thursday. The approval may prove to be a landmark event in the adoption of cryptocurrency by mainstream finance, as the ETF structure gives institutions and financial advisors a familiar and regulated way to buy exposure to bitcoin. \"We think that the SEC approval, should we and others get it, is a green light for institutions. We've been talking to quite a few of them, and they're much more interested now that the SEC effectively is paving the way,\" Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" on Monday. Ark Invest has partnered with 21Shares on a proposed bitcoin fund.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe decision comes after an official SEC social media account on Tuesday falsely said that bitcoin ETFs had been approved. The SEC said the account had been compromised. The regulator has for years opposed a so-called spot bitcoin fund, with several firms filing and then withdrawing applications for ETFs in the past. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been an outspoken critic of crypto during his tenure. However, the regulator appeared to change course on the ETF question in 2023, possibly due in part to an August loss to Grayscale in a court decision that criticized the SEC for blocking bitcoin ETFs while allowing funds that track bitcoin futures. \"Importantly, today's Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin. It should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities. Nor does the approval signal anything about the Commission's views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws,\" Gensler said in a statement Wednesday. Optimism around approval first reemerged this year after asset management giant BlackRock filed an application in June, leading to a flood of applications from its rivals. The partnership of Ark Invest and 21Shares has the longest active filing, and a deadline for the SEC on the fund in January led many industry experts to expect that the first bitcoin ETFs would be approved shortly after the start of 2024.\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "Those two were among the first of 11 funds that traded on Thursday after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved rule changes for its exchanges on Wednesday. The group combined for billions of dollars worth of trading volume in the first day.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) closed up 0.5%, well off its highs of the day, while the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) fell more than 4% after initially rising in morning trading. Both funds saw tens millions of shares traded on Thursday.\n\nBitcoin exchange-traded funds saw big swings on their first day of trading on Thursday, mirroring a volatile day for crypto prices more broadly.\n\nThe Grayscale fund is the biggest of the group, as it was converted from an over-the-counter trust that already had more than $28 billion in assets. The Hashdex fund is currently a bitcoin futures product, and while a rule change to list the fund as a spot bitcoin product was approved, the fund's registration statement to convert the fund is still under review with the SEC.\n\nThe moves for the funds came as bitcoin saw volatile trading. The digital currency briefly hit the $49,000 mark Thursday morning before falling back below $47,000, for a gain of about 1%, according to Coin Metrics. Bitcoin trades around the clock, so the first-day moves for the funds could be affected by the exact timing of their launch.\n\nEven given the heavy trading volumes and swings in bitcoin, there appeared to be no major problems with the ETFs in their first day.\n\n\"Trading today went very well, very orderly,\" said Rachel Aguirre, the U.S. head of iShares product.\n\nETFs are an investment vehicle where investors buy shares that represent a claim on the fund's underlying assets. Some of the most popular ETFs are equity index funds, though other funds in the category track bonds, derivatives products and commodities such as gold.\n\nFinancial advisors and institutional investors often use ETFs because of their liquidity and tax advantages compared to mutual funds. Asset managers are betting that bitcoin ETFs will bring new investors to crypto.\n\n\"This is actually what ETFs were made for \u2014 to take difficult, complex things and make it simple and compliant to trade. This will mainstream the asset class,\" WisdomTree CEO Jonathan Steinberg said on CNBC's \"Money Movers.\"\n\n\"This will allow a less technology-sophisticated investor to buy bitcoin in a way that they are very comfortable with,\" Steinberg added.\n\nInvestors and financial advisors will be watching closely to see not only how the bitcoin ETFs perform, but also how well they track the price of bitcoin. Wide gaps between the price of a fund and the price of the underlying bitcoin that lasts for multiple days could be a sign of thin trading or structural issues with an ETF and scare off potential buyers, even if the fund is temporarily outperforming spot bitcoin.\n\nTrading volume will also be a key metric for investors, as funds with more trading are seen as more efficient, though first-day trading volumes are not always indicative of a fund's future success.\n\n\"We really wanted to see some day one volume, but we also understand that there's a lot of platforms and gatekeepers and advisors and investors who kind of want to let this breathe a little bit and make sure the fund's doing what it's supposed to,\" David Mann, head of ETF product and capital markets for Franklin Templeton, told CNBC. The Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) saw more than 2 million shares change hands on Thursday.\n\nThe success of the funds could also be affected by different price points. Several fund issuers cut their proposed fees just below launch, and many are offering temporary waivers that cut their management fee to 0% in the short run.\n\n\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

        "title": "The SEC has approved bitcoin ETFs. Here\u2019s what to know. - The Washington Post",
        "content": "Now that regulators have cleared the way, regular investors will have easier access to the most mainstream \u2014 and valuable \u2014 cryptocurrency through bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s decision Wednesday followed numerous setbacks for the digital assets sector, including several pronounced downturns since 2022 and the successful criminal prosecutions of two of the industry\u2019s biggest players \u2014 Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of crypto exchange FTX, and his rival, Changpeng Zhao of Binance.\n\nBut the move, approved in a 3-2 vote, fell well short of a ringing endorsement. In a social media post on Tuesday ahead of the vote, SEC Chair Gary Gensler cautioned, \u201cCrypto asset securities may be marketed as new opportunities but there are serious risks involved.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nFirst introduced in 2009, bitcoin is the oldest cryptocurrency, a type of monetary asset that can be exchanged anonymously. Over the past decade, bitcoin has continued to be the most popular and stable cryptocurrency, rising to a peak of about $64,000 per coin in November 2021. After crashing along with other crypto assets in 2022, bitcoin has since rebounded. On Thursday morning, its value sat above $47,000 per coin, its price buoyed by the SEC\u2019s announcement.\n\nWhat is an ETF, and what is a bitcoin ETF?\n\nETF stands for \u201cexchange-traded fund,\u201d which is very much like a mutual fund but can be traded like stocks on financial markets. Some ETFs peg their value to the performance of the S&P 500 index, while others rise and fall with the value of more specific assets and investments, such as stocks, bonds, commodities \u2014 and now bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe value of bitcoin ETFs is tethered to the price of their namesake currency. Asset managers will now be able to sell them to regular consumers, further incorporating bitcoin into the mainstream.\n\nPreviously, buying bitcoin and other crypto was more complicated: Investors had to go through cryptocurrency trading firms such as Coinbase that charged transaction fees. Now, retail investors will be able to buy the bitcoin ETFs in the same way they might acquire a public company\u2019s stock or a mutual fund.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nWhy did the SEC approve bitcoin ETFs?\n\nThe regulator maintains that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are extremely risky, and it has been wary of approving bitcoin ETFs. But Gensler said in a statement Wednesday that a court case essentially forced its hand.\n\nLast year, a federal court ruled that the SEC had not sufficiently explained its reasons for rejecting an application to list a bitcoin ETF by crypto asset manager Grayscale. The agency\u2019s decision came in response to that ruling, Gensler said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP [exchange-traded product] shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin,\u201d Gensler said, using the agency\u2019s preferred term for the bitcoin ETF. \u201cInvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\u201d\n\nWhy does the SEC view bitcoin ETFs as risky?\n\nAll crypto currencies, including bitcoin, are extremely speculative and volatile. After the FTX crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, the price of bitcoin plunged to roughly $16,000 in a month and a half, compared with its peak of about $64,000 in 2021. Multiple crypto banks and exchanges collapsed in 2022, and many investors were wiped out.\n\nMoreover, the industry is still rife with scams, and bitcoin is regularly used by criminals to move money without being blocked by governments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw said she was deeply \u201cconcerned that these products will flood the markets and land squarely in the retirement accounts of U.S. households who can least afford to lose their savings to the fraud and manipulation that appears prevalent in the spot bitcoin markets and will impact the [bitcoin ETF\u2019s].\u201d\n\nWhich firms are selling the ETFs?\n\nEleven firms won approval to issue the ETFs. They include traditional asset managers Fidelity and Invesco, as well as crypto-focused Grayscale Investments, Valkyrie Funds and Hashdex.\n\nWhen do the ETFs start trading?\n\nThe ETFs started trading Thursday, according to Reuters. Those included BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF."

        "title": "BlackRock and Grayscale among 11 firms approved for spot Bitcoin ETFs in long-awaited SEC decision - Fortune",
        "content": "After a false start on Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday finally approved spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn a filing, the agency announced that applications for 11 issuers, including BlackRock and Grayscale, had been approved\u2014the culmination of a process that began in 2013 when the Winklevoss twins unsuccessfully sought approval for the first Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWith the SEC approving the final forms from the issuers, trading is set to begin on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a moment of traditional finance finally having broad-based, convenient access vehicles,\u201d said Robert Mitchnick, head of digital assets for BlackRock, in an interview with Fortune.\n\nPipe dream\n\nETFs, or exchange-traded funds, have grown in popularity over the past two decades, providing investors access to a basket of assets such as stocks or commodities that can be traded in the form of shares on major exchanges.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF, which tracks the current price of the popular cryptocurrency, had long been a pipe dream for the crypto industry, with the hope it could open new flows of investment from wealth managers and everyday traders who otherwise would not buy digital assets on exchanges like Coinbase.\n\nUnder successive administrations, the SEC rejected applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing the immaturity of the market and the potential for manipulation. Even after the agency in 2021 approved a Bitcoin futures ETF, which trades derivatives on Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2013regulated exchanges, the SEC continued to deny applications for spot ETFs.\n\nThat dynamic changed when Grayscale, a prominent crypto asset manager that runs the largest Bitcoin trust, sued the agency in 2022 for allowing futures-based ETFs but not spot vehicles. In anticipation of a victory, BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2023\u2014a signal to many that approval was inevitable. After Grayscale won its case in August, the timeline was set in motion.\n\nThe past few months have been filled with speculation over when approval might come, as well as how the mechanics around such novel products would work. After a flurry of meetings between prospective issuers and the SEC in December, the agency pushed a cash model for creation and redemption of shares, meaning the onus for buying and selling Bitcoin would be on the issuers.\n\nFinish line\n\nAnticipating that the SEC would relent\u2014even under the crypto-skeptical chair, Gary Gensler\u2014the Bitcoin ETF race attracted major players from across the worlds of traditional finance and crypto. While BlackRock remains the highest-profile issuer, thanks to its existing fleet of ETF products, other approved firms include Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK.\n\nCrypto-native firms, hoping to entice investors by touting their experience in the digital assets space, include Grayscale, Hashdex, and Valkyrie.\n\nThe frenzy also attracted other players that aren\u2019t issuing Bitcoin ETFs but assuming related roles. Coinbase is serving as the Bitcoin custodian for the majority of issuers, while firms such as JPMorgan, Jane Street, and Virtu are set as authorized participants\u2014partners who sit in between issuers and investors to handle the creation and redemption of ETF shares.\n\nGiven the crowded field of entrants, which includes 11 newly approved issuers, firms have spent the past few weeks undercutting one another by offering reduced fees and waivers. Others have relied on marketing campaigns with flashy television ads and appeals to the crypto community. One issuer, the asset manager VanEck, pledged 5% of profits to the developers who maintain Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nThe next development to watch will be how much capital flows into the newly opened market, as well as which issuers capture the most market share. In a Twitter Spaces last week, Matthew Sigel\u2014VanEck\u2019s head of digital asset research\u2014claimed that BlackRock anticipated $2 billion of capital to flow into ETFs from existing Bitcoin holders alone.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of hype and fascination over the approval and launch and all that, but we really think of this over a much longer time horizon,\u201d Mitchnick told Fortune.\n\nThe decider\n\nOnlookers had Wednesday circled on their calendar because it was the deadline for the SEC to approve the first issuer in line, ARK. Despite assurances of the date, shock waves rippled through the crypto world on Tuesday when a tweet from the SEC\u2019s official account announced the approval of every Bitcoin ETF application. The agency quickly clarified that its account had been hacked, with the culprit still unknown.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval on Wednesday came before the official close of market, prompting further fears of a false start\u2014especially after the initial filing disappeared from its website.\n\nThis time, the green light proved real, with Gensler posting his own statement to the SEC\u2019s website warning that the agency\u2019s approval of the ETF is not a signal that it will approve the listings of other crypto asset securities.\n\nPerhaps most surprising, in a 3-to-2 vote, Gensler, a Democrat, sided with the commission\u2019s two Republicans in voting to approve the ETFs, with the two other Democrats dissenting.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said in the past, and without prejudging any one crypto asset, the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws,\u201d Gensler wrote, adding that the approval was not an endorsement of Bitcoin.\n\n\u2018Historic milestone\u2019\n\n\u201cI am happy to confirm that the Grayscale team has received necessary regulatory approvals to uplist GBTC to NYSE Arca,\u201d Jenn Rosenthal, the firm\u2019s VP of communications, wrote in a statement to Fortune shortly after the news broke.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the SEC\u2019s decision and are excited to be at the forefront of providing U.S. investors a simpler means of allocating towards digital assets,\u201d Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, said in a statement shared with Fortune after the firm\u2019s final prospectus had been approved.\n\nCrypto-friendly lawmakers also celebrated the decision, including House Financial Services Committee chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and the chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee, French Hill (R-Ark.)\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF approvals mark a historic milestone for the future of the digital asset ecosystem in the United States,\u201d they wrote in a statement shared with Fortune."

        "content": "Bitcoin, as of Thursday morning, was up more than 5% over the past 24 hours, to about $47,600, after the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a filing on Wednesday that it had approved 11 applications to create the first generation of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. The second-most-popular cryptocurrency, Ether, was up double digits, with a 10% rally pushing it above $2,600.\n\nWednesday\u2019s approval comes after hackers took over the regulator\u2019s X/Twitter account on Tuesday and sent a fake post announcing the approval of the pending spot Bitcoin applications. The fake-out spurred a flurry of excited tweets before SEC Chairman Gary Gensler alerted potential investors to the hack, a correction that led to myriad memes and ridicule of the agency online.\n\nSimilar fears spread briefly on Wednesday after the SEC\u2019s filing announcing the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETF applications disappeared from the agency\u2019s website before reappearing. This time, Gensler confirmed the approval with a statement that said approving spot Bitcoin ETFs was the \u201cmost sustainable path forward,\u201d but did not guarantee financial products dealing with other cryptocurrencies would be approved. In a 3-to-2 vote, Gensler, a Democrat, sided with two Republican SEC commissioners in favor of approving the Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nA new chapter\n\nHope ran high among some analysts and market onlookers who said they believe spot Bitcoin ETFs will usher in a new era for Bitcoin.\n\nMark Connors, head of research at investment fund manager 3iQ, said although it may take months for some investment advisors to start bringing client money to Bitcoin, other pools of money could quickly create $2.5 billion to $3 billion of inflows after the ETFs start trading on Thursday. More investment will follow over the next months and years, he said, because TradFi firms now have an interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed.\n\n\u201cYou have the whole system now incentivized to drive investment and volume in this product,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nThursday\u2019s Bitcoin rally wasn\u2019t much of a surprise, said Ben Cole, a professor of statistics and strategy at Fordham University\u2019s Gabelli School of Business, because Bitcoin has in the past jumped on big news events, such as previous \u201chalvenings.\u201d The ease of incorporating a spot Bitcoin ETF in retirement accounts and other established portfolios also bodes well for Bitcoin\u2019s performance in the coming months and years, he added.\n\n\u201cIf you can have someone else handle that, but you can still get the exposure to the price fluctuations, that\u2019s going to be very appealing to a lot of people,\u201d Cole told Fortune.\n\nOthers on Crypto Twitter rejoiced at the news in hopes that the cryptocurrency would finally become a mainstream investment option and go on a tear.\n\nFirst Bitcoin spot ETF will start trading\n\non NYSE in next 2 hours. This is truly\n\na historic day for crypto. I hope all\n\nthese institutions send BTC higher. \u2014 Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) January 11, 2024\n\nBREAKING:\n\n\n\nSEC approves ALL #Bitcoin Spot ETFs from all participants.\n\n\n\nThe bull market has started! \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nETF performance?\n\nThe real test for the Bitcoin ETFs comes when trading begins. Already, BlackRock\u2019s ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, had garnered $2 million of shares traded early Thursday, although those shares may have been sold before the ETF was approved, according to an X post by Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\nStill, market onlookers, including British bank Standard Chartered, predicted that the new spot Bitcoin ETFs could help funnel $1 billion to Bitcoin over the next three months\u2014and $100 billion by the end of the year.\n\nAlready, the dozen or so companies vying for a spot Bitcoin ETF have begun to compete on fees, with several of the issuers dropping theirs to between 0.24% and 3% to attract customers. The average fee for a U.S. ETF is about 0.54%, according to Reuters. For comparison, the $27 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which also lets investors put money into Bitcoin, has a fee of 2%, although it plans to cut it to 1.5% for its spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nProminent finance figures have already started rallying support for spot Bitcoin ETFs, including Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, who said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday that although her firm\u2019s ETF may not see \u201covernight success,\u201d she expects institutional dollars to come around after TradFi firms work through the due diligence process.\n\nWood said the firm\u2019s ETF will look to attract both institutional and retail investors.\n\n\u201cThe interest is far and wide,\u201d she said."

        "content": "Crypto investors are waiting for the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a raft of spot bitcoin applications, likely Wednesday.\n\nWith a spot bitcoin ETF now looking very real, attention is turning to the details of how it will trade, how much it will cost, how much of the runup in bitcoin is due to demand that has been pulled forward, and premium or discount valuations.\n\nFees are competitive and will get more so\n\nWith nearly a dozen ETFs competing for attention, bitcoin buyers will be very price sensitive, and issuers are already engaged in a modest price war. For example, Cathie Wood's ARK Invest, which is partnering with 21Shares to launch a bitcoin ETF, initially announced a fee of 0.8% but on Monday announced no fee for the first six months.\n\nOther issuers are also steeply discounting prices, with several (Bitwise, ARK, Invesco) offering 0% fee for the first six months, while Grayscale is charging 1.5%.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETF fees\n\nBitwise (BITB) 0.0% (after first six months: 0.2%)\n\nARK Invest/21Shares (ARKB): 0.0% (after first six months: 0.21%)\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) 0.0% (after first six months: 0.39%)\n\niShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) 0.12% (after first 12 months: 0.25%)\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) 0.25%\n\nFranklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) 0.29%\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC) 0% (after July 31, 2024, 0.25%)\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Trust (BTCW) 0.0% (after first six months 0.3%)\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) 0.0% (after three months 0.49%)\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) 1.5%\n\nHashdex Bitcoin (DEFI) 0.9%\n\nInvesco's Galaxy Bitcoin ETF has set its expense ratio at 0.0% for the initial six months and the first $5 billion in assets, and goes to 0.39% after.\n\nSource: Bloomberg/SEC.gov\n\nHow will a spot bitcoin trade relative to bitcoin and bitcoin futures?\n\nOne of the main questions is how well a spot bitcoin ETF will track bitcoin and bitcoin futures.\n\nSimeon Hyman, ProShares' global investment strategist who manages the largest bitcoin futures ETF, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) that launched in October 2021, noted that bitcoin futures ETFs have tracked bitcoin \"fairly well.\" But he also told me, \"The spot market for bitcoin is still not mature. The futures market is regulated and mature. We'll have to wait and see how well they track against each other.\"\n\nAnother issue is whether the bitcoin ETFs will trade at a premium or discount to their net asset value. In this case, the NAV is the value of the bitcoin owned by the ETF. Some are concerned that the creation and redemption process that was agreed upon to create spot bitcoin ETFs could result in a bitcoin ETF trading at a premium to its NAV."

        "content": "Chesnot | Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission just approved the first-ever batch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds to come out of the U.S. The agency gave the green light on Wednesday to sponsors of 10 ETFs, including BlackRock, Invesco, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Ark Invest \u2014 paving the way for these funds to begin trading as soon as this week. The move was largely expected, even after a social media hacking snag. A false statement saying the regulator had approved a bitcoin ETF was published Tuesday on the SEC's social media account on X, formerly known as Twitter. The agency later clarified that its account had been compromised. The actual approval Wednesday marked a massive step for the cryptocurrency, as it will give investors increased ways to gain exposure to the token \u2014 not just from holding it directly, but via existing financial instruments that trade on a regulated stock exchange.\n\nwatch now\n\nBut what does that all mean exactly, and how does it affect investors? CNBC runs through everything you need to know about the bitcoin ETF milestone.\n\nWhat's a bitcoin ETF?\n\nAn ETF is an investment fund that tracks the performance of an underlying asset. That could be stocks, a basket of currencies, a precious metal like gold, or, in this case, bitcoin. It's a way for investors to get exposure to the value of the underlying asset without directly owning it. ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, and their value should rise when the underlying asset increases in price, or fall if it decreases. As crypto investors look to assess what the market impact of a bitcoin ETF might be, many are comparing Wednesday's news to the greenlighting of the SPDR Gold Shares ETF \u2014 the first-ever spot gold ETF \u2014 in 2004. The total gold market capitalization was worth around $1 trillion to $2 trillion before the gold ETF was approved, and this subsequently ballooned to $16 trillion in a few years after, according to Vijay Ayyar, vice president of international markets for Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX. \"Bitcoin's adoption will be much faster and bigger than that,\" Ayyar told CNBC via WhatsApp.\n\nwatch now\n\nAyyar said the story for bitcoin and crypto will \"accelerate\" in 2024, as the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF could spark interest from retail investors who were previously sitting on the sidelines.\n\nWhat does a bitcoin ETF mean for investors?\n\nA bitcoin ETF opens up the audience of people and institutions that can buy and sell bitcoin to those with little experience trading cryptocurrency. \"This ETF has two main impacts: increased distribution in the US (a moderate impact, as there have been ETFs outside of the US for years) and increased credibility of crypto as an 'asset class' (a very high impact),\" Kevin de Patoul, co-founder and CEO of crypto liquidity provider Keyrock, told CNBC. \"There is now a U.S. bitcoin spot ETF, and bitcoin is no longer considered shady or infamous. This significantly changes the perception for the mainstream public.\" It also means that bitcoin could start appearing in mainstream portfolios, where many more retail investors can gain exposure. Big institutional fund managers can add it to their investment funds. Retirement planners can now include it in employer-sponsored 401(k) plans. This makes it much easier to own bitcoin, as you don't have to rely on a vulnerable piece of hardware for storage. Investors don't need to tackle the difference between \"hot\" and \"cold\" wallets, which store digital tokens. Instead, they can just buy an ETF from one of the many regulated asset managers that are set to go live with their own ETFs.\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "In this article BTC.CB=\n\nBLK\n\nGBTC\n\nCOIN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nOmar Marques | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nIt's cheaper than ever to buy bitcoin . After 10 years of rejections, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved 11 applications for bitcoin exchange-traded funds submitted by some of the biggest asset managers in the world, including BlackRock and Fidelity. In many cases, investors will pay lower fees than they would if they bought the digital currency from a crypto exchange directly. Instead of having to go to an asset exchange such as Kraken, Binance or Coinbase to purchase and hold a token like bitcoin, traders can now turn to a so-called spot bitcoin ETF for direct exposure to the digital asset market. An ETF allows investors to buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin through the same mechanism they already use to buy stock and bond index funds. This also eliminates the burden of managing their holdings, which typically involves maintaining a cryptocurrency wallet and cold storage to safeguard that investment.\n\nwatch now\n\nMore than 52 million Americans own crypto today, but industry participants are hopeful that the slew of approvals will draw in new retail and institutional investors who have been waiting on the sidelines until traditional financial firms offered an alternative on-ramp to crypto. \"Imagine what will happen once ETFs are introduced and widely available,\" Coinbase Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi said on the company's most recent earnings call in November. \"RIAs, retirement funds, and other institutions that have been precluded from this asset class historically will gain access to crypto for the first time, and that's very powerful.\" Prior to Wednesday's approval, the $30 trillion advised wealth management industry in the U.S. had been mostly locked out from accessing the crypto asset class.\n\nwatch now\n\nwatch now\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC , has a few favorable characteristics. Most notably, it has been trading since 2015 as a closed-end fund. \"GBTC was something of a monopoly \u2014 they had investors stuck in GBTC paying 2% fees,\" said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar, a provider of investment research. Though approval of multiple spot bitcoin ETFs translates to increased fee competition and a way out for current GBTC investors, many traders would take a capital gains tax hit if they exited their GBTC position to purchase another ETF.\n\nwatch now\n\nWhether the appetite for spot bitcoin ETFs is overblown is another key concern among investors. Research firm Bernstein, which billed the new spot ETFs as the \"largest pipe ever built between traditional financial markets and crypto financial markets,\" expects momentum to build slowly. Analysts with JPMorgan and Mizuho have also cautioned that investor appetite might not be there. Unlike other commodities that are difficult to own directly, such as a barrel of oil or a gold bar, bitcoin is easier to own. JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note to investors on Nov. 21 that they see gold ETFs as the most apt gauge for a cryptocurrency ETF outlook. \"Gold ETFs are currently 1.4% of above ground (investible) gold,\" the JPMorgan analysts wrote. \"We believe that the cryptocurrency markets are pricing in an optimistic impact from Bitcoin ETFs that is likely to fall short of expectations.\" \u2014 CNBC's Jordan Smith contributed to this report.

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM=\n\nETH.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nBitcoin rose in volatile trading Thursday after the Securities and Exchange Commission gave the green light for the first-ever spot bitcoin ETFs to trade in the U.S., as expected. The cryptocurrency was last up 1% at $46,289.15, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it punched above $49,000, reaching levels not seen since December 2021. Meanwhile, the price of ether jumped 5% to May 2022 highs. It last traded at $2,594.60. The ETF approval is a landmark victory for the crypto industry, which first sought to launch a bitcoin ETF more than 10 years ago. Optimism had been building since Grayscale's big legal win against the SEC in August over the regulator's refusal to let it convert its popular Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The flagship cryptocurrency's price has increased 80% since then.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin erases earlier losses after SEC greenlights bitcoin ETFs\n\nFollowing the SEC's decision, bitcoin initially edged lower, as expected by many traders. Although the volume of inflows into the new funds remains to be seen, bitcoin ETFs are still widely expected to drive the demand \u2013 and ultimately, price \u2013 of bitcoin higher. \"I'd expect to see bitcoin bounce around,\" said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs. \"In the past, when ETFs have come to market on a particular theme, one often sees a run up in the underlying asset, a sell-the-news upon launch, and then a slower and steadier rally.\" \"I wouldn't make much of these bitcoin price moves in the next couple of days, but I do think that the approval is going to lead to some longer term price appreciation,\" she added. \"Trading on an exchange, without a digital wallet, [and] custody similar to any other fund product makes bitcoin exposure far more interesting to those institutions with bullish views on the asset class.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nEther's rally propped up other coins in the Ethereum ecosystem. The token tied to Polygon gained 7%, Chainlink advanced 5% and Uniswap rose 6%. \"Now that the bitcoin ETF speculation has come to fruition it looks like traders are rotating to ether to get ahead of the next narrative, an ETH ETF, while ETH looks relatively cheap compared to most other tokens,\" said Conor Ryder, head of research at the stablecoin company Ethena Labs. The SEC is due to give decisions on spot ETH ETF applications beginning in May. BlackRock , Invesco , Ark and VanEck are among the firms in line for approval, as well as Grayscale, which is seeking to convert its existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF. \"It's all about getting ahead of the narratives \u2014 bitcoin has rallied versus ether for the last six months thanks to spot ETF speculation, and ETF approval ties a bow on that narrative,\" Ryder said. \"Meanwhile ETH has struggled to find any momentum and has underperformed compared to most of the smaller Layer 1s,\" or blockchain networks, like Solana and Cardano. Ether lagged bitcoin in 2023, rising just 90% compared to bitcoin's 157%."

        "title": "After false SEC post on ETF, bulls still see bitcoin at all-time highs this year - CNBC",
        "content": "Representations of cryptocurrency Bitcoin are placed on a PC motherboard in this illustration taken June 16, 2023. Dado Ruvic | Reuters\n\nSt. Moritz, SWITZERLAND \u2014 Top players in the crypto industry gathered at a lavish hotel in elegant Swiss ski town St. Moritz ahead of the Wednesday start of the Crypto Finance Conference. Many were at dinners and drinks when a post from the account of the U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) on the X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday claimed that the long-awaited bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) had been approved. It turned out it hadn't. Instead, the SEC said its account had been compromised.\n\nThe false news was enough to send bitcoin spiking briefly before falling. It also ruined the celebrations of the crypto industry players in St. Moritz, many of who have been waiting for years for a bitcoin ETF to get past skeptics at the SEC. \"We walked into the lobby bar, right as the tweet came out, and everyone was ecstatic ... and then five minutes later after all the drinks were ordered ... very sad,\" Meltem Demirors, head of strategy at CoinShares, told CNBC on Wednesday. \"But, look, I think if you're a screenwriter, you couldn't write the narrative of this industry, it's wild, its preposterous, its crazy.\" The false post has not dampened the mood among crypto bulls, who say that new bitcoin highs are possible this year. \"I think we are going over six figures by the end of the year,\" Demirors said, highlighting two key reasons \u2014 a bitcoin ETF approval and the so-called upcoming \"halving\" event.\n\nwatch now\n\nBoth of these factors underpinned the more than 150% rally in bitcoin of last year \u2014 a rise that has continued into 2024.\n\nETFs excitement\n\nMany are excited about a bitcoin ETF, which tracks the price of the cryptocurrency and allows market participants to invest in bitcoin without actually owning the crypto. The thought is that an ETF could bring in larger and more traditional investors, who didn't want to go near cryptocurrency. \"This is a watershed moment, no question about it. It's going to usher in a lot of institutional capital, it's going to change the dynamic of this asset class completely,\" Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, told CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nwatch now\n\nCrypto execs are not expecting that the SEC social media debacle will fully derail the ETF approval. Fred Thiel, CEO of bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings, told CNBC that the SEC may \"delay\" approval, but will likely give the green light soon. \"I have a feeling that they're likely going to approve a whole slew of them and then move on,\" Thiel said. Demirors of CoinShares said that the ETFs could potentially see capital inflows of $25 billion to $100 billion in their first year of trade, coming from various areas, including the trillions of dollars in U.S. retirement funds.\n\nWhere does the bitcoin price go in 2024?\n\nThe previous all-time high of bitcoin was logged just under $69,000 in November 2021. The bitcoin price collapsed in 2022, as projects failed, bankruptcies flooded the industry and major players such as the crypto exchange and FTX faced criminal probes in the U.S. Bitcoin then rose by more than 150% in 2023, with much of that increase owed to excitement around the ETF. But bitcoin also has historically traded in cycles, which include key events called halvings \u2014 when the rewards that miners earn from mining bitcoin are slashed in half. This reduces the amount of bitcoin supply in the market and has often preceded a bull run to all-time highs. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in circulation. The next halving is due to take place in April 2024. The anticipation over ETF and the halving has caused the crypto industry to get very bullish on bitcoin this year. \"I think bitcoin will either follow its historical cycle, which would have it increase in price, achieve the prior all-time high some time toward the end of this year, then new all-time highs towards the end of next year. That's if it follows historical patterns,\" Thiel said.\n\nwatch now"

Without substantial and measurable changes to Bitcoin mining industry practices in the near term, this presents serious challenges for our efforts to reduce carbon emissions and avert the worst consequences of the climate crisis. As Bitcoin scales, it is incumbent on BlackRock, Fidelity, and all financial institutions investing in Bitcoin, to play an active role in solving its carbon emissions problem and ensure that the mining industry makes serious efforts to rein in its use of fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cSpeculation and hype alone about a potential Bitcoin ETF based on the current, or spot, price of bitcoin that trades on traditional stock exchanges has driven up bitcoin\u2019s price. Now that the Bitcoin ETF has been approved, it will make it easier for casual and institutional investors to bet on Bitcoin. When Bitcoin\u2019s price goes up, so does its environmental impact. More electricity is used by miners competing to win more valuable Bitcoin rewards in the giant guessing game called Proof-of-Work mining. That electricity is predominantly generated by fossil fuels which leads to more carbon emissions and water use. SEC\u2019s approval of a Bitcoin ETF is a win for executives at big Wall Street companies but a loss for the climate and society.\u201d\n\n###\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Senior Communications Specialist at Greenpeace USA (+1) 631-404-9977, [email protected]\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.

        "content": "Gary Gensler, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), during an interview in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, July 27, 2023.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler's statement on why the agency has approved the listing and trading of a group of spot bitcoin ETFs indicates that he is still hostile to the cryptocurrency in general.\n\nGensler was faced with the difficult task of explaining why the SEC has reversed its position on bitcoin ETFs. He said that circumstances \"have changed.\"\n\nThey changed because the SEC lost a key court case last August: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that the commission failed to adequately explain its reasoning when it turned down Grayscale's proposed bitcoin ETF.\n\nGensler was forced to give in, but not on all fronts.\n\nFor starters, he is engaged in several ongoing legal battles with the crypto community. In large part, the conflicts are based on his claim that most crypto assets are securities that come under the purview of the SEC.\n\nIn his statement, Gensler gave no indication he was changing his approach on this topic:\n\n\"Nor does the approval signal anything about the Commission's views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws. As I've said in the past, and without prejudging any one crypto asset, the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws.\"\n\nWill bitcoin ETFs make Wall Street \u2014 wirehouses and financial advisors \u2014 more willing to recommend the cryptocurrency to clients and allow it to trade on their platforms?\n\nPossibly, but Gensler made it clear that broker-dealers will have to adhere to existing rules:\n\n\"Further, existing rules and standards of conduct will apply to the purchase and sale of the approved [exchange traded products]. This includes, for example, Regulation Best Interest when broker-dealers recommend ETPs to retail investors, as well as a fiduciary duty under the Investment Advisers Act for investment advisers.\"\n\nRegulation Best Interest requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of their retail customers when making investment recommendations. These recommendations must be \"suitable\" for the client.\n\nThat is a potential investment minefield for investment advisors, and it's likely to keep many advisors away from recommending bitcoin for some time.\n\nFinally, Gensler couldn't help taking a parting shot at bitcoin in general:\n\n\"Though we're merit neutral, I'd note that the underlying assets in the metals ETPs have consumer and industrial uses, while in contrast bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that's also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing. While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\""

        "content": "Key Takeaways Spot bitcoin ETFs had their first day of trading in the U.S. on Thursday.\n\nWhile there are currently 10 different spot bitcoin ETFs on the market, Grayscale's GBTC accounted for more than half of all of Thursday's trading volume for these financial products.\n\nAccording to one analyst, GBTC's current dominance may be due to investors selling that particular offering for one of the new alternatives.\n\nDespite the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), some major financial institutions are declining to offer these products to their clients.\n\nOn the first day of spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) trading, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is a converted version of an already-existing financial product, dominated the competition. That said, there is reason to believe this could be a temporary phenomenon.\n\nGrayscale Takes the Early Lead, But It May Not Last\n\nThere was more than $4.6 billion worth of trading volume in spot bitcoin ETFs on U.S. exchanges on Thursday, which was the first day the newly approved financial products were allowed to be traded.\n\nTrading volume does not necessarily mean money flowing into these products. Why is that? More than half of the trading involved GBTC; however, this could be a temporary trend caused by GBTC holders selling their holdings in favor of alternative options, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart.\n\nWhen GBTC is removed, spot bitcoin ETF offerings from Blackrock (BLK) and Fidelity are the other major players in terms of volume, with Blackrock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) seeing more than $1 billion in trading volume on the day. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin fund (FBTC) saw greater than $700 million in volume.\n\nWhen combined, the offerings from Grayscale, Blackrock, and Fidelity accounted for roughly 87% of the total spot bitcoin ETF trading volume today.\n\nThere are currently 10 different spot bitcoin ETF products approved for trading in the U.S. Hashdex's Bitcoin ETF (DEFI) that received approval to convert from a bitcoin futures ETF to a spot product clarified Thursday that it didn't hold a spot position yet. It will change its name and investment strategy at a later date.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Galaxy Investment Partners CEO Michael Novogratz shared his view that the battle for spot bitcoin ETF dominance will be between Blackrock, Fidelity, and Invesco, despite the early centralization of activity around GBTC.\n\nVanguard Stays on the Sidelines, UBS Approaches With Caution\n\nWhile yesterday's official regulatory approval of spot bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was viewed by many as a landmark moment for the crypto asset from both a regulatory and institutional perspective. Brokerage clients of Fidelity and Charles Schwab (SCHW) have access to the spot bitcoin ETFs but there are still some major financial firms that are limiting their customers' access to this new product.\n\n\"While we continuously evaluate our brokerage offer and evaluate new product entries to the market, spot Bitcoin ETFs will not be available for purchase on the Vanguard platform,\" said a Vanguard spokesperson in a statement. \"We also have no plans to offer Vanguard Bitcoin ETFs or other crypto-related products. Our perspective is that these products do not align with our offer focused on asset classes such as equities, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio.\"\n\nOther firms took a more measured approach. A source close to UBS (UBS) said that the company is allowing its clients access to \"more than half\" but not all of the spot bitcoin ETFs available.\n\nWhile it is unclear which ETFs are available to UBS customers, trades will be allowed only if certain conditions are met. Those include trades that are unsolicited (initiated by the client and not sought by the advisor), made from a brokerage account as opposed to an advisory account and in line with the client's risk tolerance, among other factors."

        "title": "SEC ends crypto drama by giving the green light to 11 bitcoin ETFs - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The moment the crypto world wanted finally happened Wednesday. And this time it was for real.\n\nRegulators on Wednesday gave money managers the green light to launch 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, allowing everyday investors to get exposure to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency without having to own it.\n\nThe ETFs, which begin trading Thursday, could make bitcoin a potential staple in 401(k)s, IRAs, and pension plans and give it mainstream acceptance.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission made the announcement roughly 24 hours after a fake social media post claimed those approvals had already been granted.\n\nThe chaos triggered by that unauthorized post on X reverberated from Wall Street to Washington while attracting new scrutiny to the SEC, a longtime foe of the industry that is still in the middle of a widespread crackdown on some of crypto\u2019s major players.\n\nThe price of bitcoin seesawed Tuesday and Wednesday as investors tried to make sense of the mishap, which erased tens of billions in market value in just minutes.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler made it clear in a statement Wednesday that his agency \"did not approve or endorse bitcoin\" when it signed off on the new products and called Wednesday's announcement \"the most sustainable path forward\" following a key court defeat on this issue last summer.\n\n\"Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,\" he said in his statement.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler. (Jonathan Ernst/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nOne SEC commissioner, Caroline Crenshaw, published a dissenting opinion that called the agency's actions \"unsound and ahistorical.\"\n\n\"I am concerned that these products will flood the markets and land squarely in the retirement accounts of US households who can least afford to lose their savings to the fraud and manipulation that appears prevalent in the spot bitcoin markets,\" she said in her statement.\n\nThe SEC has rejected such applications in the past, arguing the products were vulnerable to market manipulation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe list of applicants approved by the SEC Wednesday included some of the biggest names on Wall Street, from BlackRock (BLK) to Franklin Templeton (BEN), as well as a number of firms better known in the crypto world.\n\nThese issuers competed with one another in the run-up to their launches to offer the lowest fees, hoping to attract as many investors as possible once ETFs begin trading.\n\nOther big Wall Street players plan to be part of the action, as well. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) are among the giant banks that have offered to help some of these money managers create and redeem shares of their new funds.\n\nOptimism about these approvals helped bitcoin surge 164% in 2023 and start 2024 by rising above $47,000, its highest level in nearly two years.\n\nA decade in the making\n\nThe crypto industry has been waiting more than a decade for this moment.\n\nThe first application to create a spot bitcoin ETF came in 2013 from crypto entrepreneurs and twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, famous for their early role in the creation of Facebook.\n\nEntrepreneurs Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. (Lucas Jackson/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nSince then, the SEC has denied more than 30 similar applications.\n\nA key turnaround moment came last year in June when the world\u2019s biggest money manager, BlackRock, filed for a spot bitcoin ETF. The interest from one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest names sparked other asset managers to follow suit.\n\nAnother important development came last August when one of the ETF applicants, Grayscale Investments, won a key legal victory over the SEC. Grayscale had sued the SEC in 2022 after it wasn't allowed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin offering.\n\nIts core argument was that the agency had already approved exchange-traded products that held bitcoin futures contracts and thus had \"acted arbitrarily and capriciously.\"\n\nA three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Washington sided with Grayscale, saying the firm had \"advanced substantial evidence\" its product was similar to bitcoin futures ETFs previously approved by the SEC.\n\nThat forced the SEC to reconsider Grayscale\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF application, along with others filed by rival money managers.\n\n\"We are now faced with a new set of filings similar to those we have disapproved in the past,\" Gensler said in his statement Wednesday. \"Circumstances, however, have changed.\"\n\nOne of the applicants, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood, told Yahoo Finance that the dominant providers of spot bitcoin ETFs will be those that take in the most money from investors right out of the gate.\n\nThe winners \"will be a few and it will be the most liquid,\" she said.\n\nCathie Wood, ARK Investment Management's CEO. (David Swanson/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nHistorically, launches for other bitcoin products have sent bitcoin\u2019s price on a wild ride.\n\nIt happened in 2017 with the launch of the country\u2019s first bitcoin futures contracts and then in 2021 with the SEC\u2019s approval of the first bitcoin futures ETFs. Prices soared and then fell by large amounts in the year following the launches.\n\nIn recent weeks, much debate has raged over whether bitcoin will rise or fall once the lauded moment of approval comes to pass.\n\nGautam Chhugani, managing director of the research arm for Bernstein, said his team estimates such financial products will garner $10 billion or more in investment flows through the end of 2024 and \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" over a two-year period.\n\nThat, he added, will help push bitcoin\u2019s price even higher.\n\n\"We do think that bitcoin goes to $150,000 by 2025,\" Chhugani added.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for the latest crypto news, updates, and more related to ethereum and bitcoin prices, crypto ETFs, and market implications for cryptocurrencies\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "title": "Bitcoin goes public: What the ETF victory means and what comes next - Fortune",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission finally yielded to the inevitable on Wednesday, allowing 11 companies to package Bitcoin as shares and letting investors buy stock in the cryptocurrency just as they would shares of Apple or Tesla. Crypto billionaire Michael Saylor marked the moment by saying \u201cTomorrow Bitcoin Goes Public,\u201d and that description sounds about right.\n\nSince the first batches of Bitcoins arrived in 2009\u2014way back when the blockchain spit out 50 Bitcoins every 10 minutes\u2014the cryptocurrency has been treated by many as something disreputable. This has especially been the case in Washington, D.C., and, until recently, on Wall Street, where bankers liked to sneer at it. Now, though, financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity will be using their new ETFs as a vehicle to distribute Bitcoin to their many clients, who will in turn start including it in retail investors\u2019 pension and retirement funds. This will only increase mainstream support for Bitcoin and help turn many remaining detractors into allies.\n\nI\u2019m hardly the only one to hold the thesis that the long-term case for Bitcoin is bullish, and I\u2019m confident it will be proved right in the next five years. The harder thing to predict is what happens in the short term. A quick look at the market confirms the popular crypto wisdom that any price jump from the ETF approval was largely baked in. The thing to watch now is whether the flood of new Bitcoin ETF shares, which will begin trading as soon as today, are snapped up or\u2014as is very possible\u2014if demand turns out to be muted and the currency slumps. A further wildcard is if the impending Bitcoin \u201chalving,\u201d which will cut the supply of new coins per block from six to three, will deliver an additional fillip for demand or if that too is baked in. No matter what happens in the next few months, though, it does not change the long-term bull case.\n\nThe other thing to watch in the coming days is which of the Bitcoin ETF issuers gobbles up the biggest market share\u2014history shows new ETFs are a winner-take-all business\u2014and which firms just spent months on expensive legal paperwork to get 1% or 2% of the market. Meanwhile, a related and more interesting question is how long it takes for the SEC to approve an Ethereum ETF, which is also only a matter of time. And beyond that, will the likes of XRP and Dogecoin also get the coveted stamp of respectability that comes with an ETF wrapper? The answer could be years or never.\n\nFinally, there is the matter of the SEC\u2019s colossal screwup on Tuesday, which saw a hacker take over the agency\u2019s X/Twitter account because it had failed to implement a basic security feature. This has already diminished Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s rapidly diminishing political clout, but also poses a fun mystery. As Matt Levine noted, a seasoned financial criminal could have used the compromised SEC account to come up with a more lucrative scheme than publishing a fake announcement about news that was already expected and priced in.\n\nGo ahead and put on your criminal mastermind hat for a moment and think of how you could make the most money with the SEC\u2019s Twitter account. Maybe announce a criminal investigation of Apple while shorting the stock? You get the point. Fortunately, the hacker (who is in huge trouble if caught) didn\u2019t do anything of the sort, suggesting that Levine may be right that the whole point was to troll the hell out of Gensler. Chalk it up to yet another colorful moment in a crypto history full of them.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe SEC stated the FBI is helping investigate who is responsible for Tuesday's social media hack.

        "content": "More than a dozen financial firms are involved in new bitcoin exchange-traded funds that began trading Thursday, but one of the biggest fund issuers and money managers in the world still won't touch cryptocurrency.\n\nA Vanguard spokeswoman told CNBC that the asset management giant has no plans to create a bitcoin ETF of its own, or to even offer funds from other issuers on its trading platform.\n\n\"While we continuously evaluate our brokerage offer and evaluate new product entries to the market, spot Bitcoin ETFs will not be available for purchase on the Vanguard platform. We also have no plans to offer Vanguard Bitcoin ETFs or other crypto-related products,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Our perspective is that these products do not align with our offer focused on asset classes such as equities, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio,\" the statement continued.\n\nVanguard is one of two dominant players in the U.S. ETF market. Its chief rival BlackRock has entered the bitcoin space, with the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) launching Thursday.\n\nVanguard, headquartered just outside Philadelphia, has earned a reputation for being a low cost, and more conservative investment manager. Under its founder, Jack Bogle, Vanguard helped to drive down costs for investors starting in the 1970s by introducing passive stock index funds that tracked broader markets and, on average, outperformed highly paid active managers. It also constantly lowered its fees.\n\nBogle died in 2019 and Vanguard now oversees more than $8 trillion in assets but still operates using many of its founder's more cautious beliefs.\n\n\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

        "content": "Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this story incorrectly included a firm's name as offering spot bitcoin ETFs. The story is updated to remove it.\n\nBefore now, everyday investors who wanted to trade digital currencies generally had to go to crypto exchanges, a potential deal-breaker for people unfamiliar with bitcoin.\n\nThat changed on Wednesday when federal regulators voted that ordinary American investors can buy and sell spot bitcoin ETFs in the same way they trade stocks.\n\nThe move opens up bitcoin investing to a larger swath of the American public, including potential investors who never quite understood what bitcoin is or how it works, let alone how to buy and sell it. Trading began in earnest on Thursday.\n\nThe vote, taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, allows the sale of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, to the public.\n\nSEC approves bitcoin ETFs, clearing way for public trading\n\nETFs, for the uninitiated, are an investment vehicle akin to a mutual fund. They are traded on exchanges and typically track a specific index or \u201cbasket\u201d of stocks, bonds or commodities. They function like stocks, with prices that change throughout the trading day, whereas mutual funds trade once a day at a single price.\n\nAnticipation for the SEC vote drove up the price of bitcoin, which is notoriously volatile. The currency traded above $47,000 on Thursday, according to Coindesk, up from around $17,000 at the start of last year.\n\n\u201cToday is a monumental day in the history of digital assets,\u201d said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at a bitcoin ETF issuer called Hashdex, in a statement quoted in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe new ETFs will be listed on Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, all highly regulated exchanges, according to Reuters.\n\nInvesting in a spot-bitcoin ETF will allow investors to reap potential profits from bitcoin without the attendant risks of owning bitcoin directly, Reuters said.\n\nInvestment experts say investing in a bitcoin ETF will be both easier and safer than buying bitcoin directly. Owning bitcoin directly means storing it in a digital \"wallet.\" Using the wallet means maintaining passkeys, encrypted strings of letters and numbers that enable crypto transfers, according to Investopedia. The wallets can be appealing targets for hackers, and the system lacks federal regulation.\n\nBuying and selling bitcoin ETFs will engender trading fees, Investopedia says, but the fees should be attractively low, especially in the first months of trading.\n\nThe federal securities agency had rejected prior bids for publicly traded bitcoin ETFs, on fears that bitcoin is susceptible to manipulation and fraud. The industry has sought ETF trading for more than a decade.\n\nBitcoin ETFs:Here are the best options this year\n\nBitcoin ETFs cleared for trading include Fidelity, BlackRock\n\nThe applications approved Wednesday came from 11 issuers, including such big-name investment firms as BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nTwo of five SEC commissioners voted against the decision. One of them, Democrat Caroline Crenshaw, called the vote \u201cunsound and ahistorical\u201d in a statement.\n\nTime to give CDs a spin?Certificate of deposit interest rates are highest in years\n\nPublic trading of bitcoin funds marks \u201cthe beginning of a world where it can be part of every portfolio,\u201d said Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of the crypto platform Anchorage Digital, speaking to Investor\u2019s Business Daily."

        "content": "As many investors patiently await approval for a spot bitcoin ETF (BTC-USD) , some may still be wondering what exactly they're waiting for. Yahoo Finance Anchor Brad Smith has them covered as he explains exactly the spot bitcoin ETF is and how investors can capitalize on the opportunity.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Approvals for Spot Bitcoin ETFs need to happen today as the SEC has pushed its decision up until the deadline. And investors keeping an eager eye out for any news on the exchange traded funds. Let's delve into this with Yahoo Finance's own Brad Smith to tell us what the Spot Bitcoin ETFs are and what they mean for the market. Hey, Brad.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Hey, Rachelle. Well, yes, it's still an ETF where you've already had many commonly traded assets or baskets of securities that make up ETFs in the past. But what is the purpose for this one specifically in Bitcoin? The purpose for this one is where a fund would hold Bitcoin with the investment value proposition being for the shares that they are then listing publicly to reflect the performance of the value of a Bitcoin at a more cost effective and commonly known trading mechanism than buying cryptocurrency.\n\nSo really it just takes us back to the question of how an ETF traditionally is created and what makes this one just slightly different because of the holding a much more riskier asset or commonly thought of as that in Bitcoin? Well, how an ETF is created. You've got an ETF manager. They basically file for these plans with the SEC. We've got multiples of these, and the SEC reviewing them for now years at this point.\n\nAnd then the sponsor, they're looking for some type of agreement and an authorized participant, a market maker. The m they acquire typically stock shares previously. But in this case, they would have Bitcoin that they would be able to put into a fund. And then ultimately, they would then list that ETF and put those ETF shares up in the public market. And so they would trade just like regular stock, but it would be a basket of stocks previously. In this case, it would be a basket of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is most prominently the submission that we've seen to this point.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo to try and simplify this, at the end of the day, the ETF is still going to be listed the same. It's really just the asset that is held in the fund. And we've got multiple funds now that are putting their ETF listings forward so that people can simply just go into their registered or customary brokerage and still place a trade the same way they would if they were buying a similar or just a single stock at the end of the day.\n\nAnd so what we're going to see coming forward from the SEC is, at the end of the day, if they're able to move this forward and give and grant a lot of these permissions to move forward and list these, then you could perhaps see an inflow of people that are just more comfortable buying on their exchange or their trading platform that they already purchased through at this point, Rachelle.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: I appreciate that breakdown. I remember an analyst noting that if you weren't already comfortable buying Bitcoin-- don't get overexcited and jump into the ETF if you already weren't comfortable buying Bitcoin. Appreciate that breakdown. Our very own Brad Smith."

        "content": "Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThe bitcoin exchange-traded funds launching Thursday after the SEC's long-awaited approval come at a wide variety of price points, with signs that a fee war is already underway. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) has the lowest expense ratio of all the new bitcoin funds, at 0.20%. Several other funds are close behind, including the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) at 0.21% and the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) at 0.25%. The Bitwise fund also has a temporary waiver that will eliminate the fee entirely for six months on the first $1 billion of assets. Other proposed funds have similar waivers, meaning early adopters of the bitcoin ETFs will have little or zero management cost for a brief time.\n\nBitcoin ETF fee comparison Fund Ticker Fee Bitwise Bitcoin ETF BITB 0.20%* Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB 0.21%* Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund FBTC 0.25%* iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT 0.25%* Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund BRRR 0.25%* VanEck Bitcoin Trust HODL 0.25% Franklin Bitcoin ETF EZBC 0.29% WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund BTCW 0.30%* Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF BTCO 0.39%* Hashdex Bitcoin ETF DEFI 0.94% Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC 1.5%\n\nSource: SEC filings; * indicates temporary waiver for part or all of the management fee\n\nThe fees for bitcoin funds are higher than many broad stock index funds, with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) charging less than 0.10%. But the pricing is in line with or even below the biggest commodity funds, as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and the United States Oil Fund (USO) charge 0.40% and 0.60%, respectively. Fund managers make money by charging fees on the assets under management. ETF fees have been trending lower over time, and some asset managers have shown a willingness to run a new fund at a loss in order to attract more assets and maximize revenue long term. The fees are taken out of a fund's asset pool, and investors are not billed individually. The low prices before the launch show that the battle to lower fees is already in effect for crypto funds. For example, Ark-21Shares, Valkyrie, Invesco-Galaxy and others had shown higher fees initially but lowered them in subsequent filings. Even Bitwise dropped its proposed fee to 0.20% from 0.24%, which was already the lowest of the initial batch. \"I think the level of competition was maybe higher than expected. I think there were a couple of issuers like Ark for example that signaled potentially higher fees, and once the rubber sort of met the road, they all came in pretty low,\" said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar.\n\nMuch cheaper than options before"

        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the first spot bitcoin exchange traded funds in a watershed moment that cryptocurrency enthusiasts are betting will draw new retail and institutional investors into the market.\n\nThe top American securities regulator cleared 11 ETFs to list, with sponsors ranging from established players such as Fidelity and Invesco to digitally focused newcomers including Grayscale and Ark Invest.\n\nThe first funds \u2014 which trade on exchanges like stocks and enjoy special tax treatment in the US \u2014 are expected to start trading as soon as Thursday morning, when BlackRock will ring the opening bell at Nasdaq to promote its iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nThe approval comes after months of anticipation and a bitter legal battle. It also caps a wild 24 hours that saw hackers briefly seize control of the SEC\u2019s account on the social media site X and falsely claim that the applications had already been approved, prompting sharp swings in bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin was trading 3 per cent higher at about $47,000 on Thursday morning, well below the $69,000 peak it hit in November 2021 but nearly three times the $16,000 trough it hit in December 2022 after the collapse of the now notorious crypto exchange FTX.\n\nWhile spot bitcoin ETFs have been available in other markets, the US approvals are expected to usher in a new era for the most popular and liquid crypto token. US institutional and retail investors will now be able to gain direct exposure to the coin through a regulated product, without the risks of buying from unregulated exchanges or the higher costs associated with ETFs that invest in bitcoin futures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge milestone, it\u2019s recognition of bitcoin being a large-scale traditional investment,\u201d said Jad Comair, chief executive of Melanion Capital, the first company to launch a bitcoin thematic ETF in the EU. \u201cWe\u2019re opening the doors to Wall Street.\u201d\n\nThe decision also marks a U-turn by the SEC. The regulator resisted spot bitcoin ETFs for nearly a decade on the grounds that cryptocurrencies were susceptible to manipulation and fraud. But last year, Grayscale successfully challenged the watchdog\u2019s rejection of an earlier spot bitcoin application. A federal appeals court ruled in August that the decision was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d, putting pressure on the SEC to change its stance.\n\nSome crypto enthusiasts are betting that the ETFs will substantially boost demand for digital assets, though some ETF observers are sceptical that massive sums will flood into the products. When ProShares launched the first bitcoin futures ETF in 2021, it pulled in $1bn in two days.\n\nBut consumer protection and investor groups have warned that making the product available via an ETF would encourage retail investors to move money into a sector known for repeated scandals and massive price fluctuations.\n\nDennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, said the approval \u201cis a historic mistake that will not only unleash crypto predators on tens of millions of investors and retirees but will also likely undermine financial stability\u201d.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler tried to split the difference in a statement. \u201cWhile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin,\u201d he said, telling investors to \u201cremain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto\u201d.\n\nThe false message posted to the SEC\u2019s X account on Tuesday sent the bitcoin price up to a 1.5 per cent daily gain before falling as much as 3.4 per cent after the regulator set the record straight.\n\nThe aspiring ETFs are similar in that they all invest in bitcoin directly. All aim to launch organically except for Grayscale, which seeks to convert its $29bn bitcoin trust into an ETF, and Hashdex, which plans to convert a bitcoin futures fund into a spot one.\n\nA price war has already broken out among the new ETF providers. BlackRock, Fidelity and others updated their paperwork earlier this week to announce fees less than 0.5 per cent, with several promising to waive charges altogether in the early months of trading.\n\nGrayscale chief executive Michael Sonnenshein told the Financial Times that his firm had dropped its fee from 2 per cent to 1.5 per cent but did not plan further cuts. As a conversion from an existing product, GBTC \u201cis coming to market in a very differentiated way from other ETF issuers that are starting from zero and are just getting their product launched\u201d, he said.\n\nArk\u2019s Cathie Wood \u2014 whose firm will not impose its 0.21 per cent fee until six months after launch or until its ETF reaches $1bn \u2014 characterised bitcoin as a \u201cpublic good\u201d and said she was comfortable using the product as a loss leader.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we provide access and make it as accessible as possible,\u201d Wood told the FT. \u201cWe are not looking to maximise profits on this. We\u2019ve got other actively managed products that will help us.\u201d\n\nIn a departure from normal ETF practice, the funds will use cash to create and redeem new shares rather than in-kind transactions involving their underlying assets \u2014 bitcoin, in this case.\n\nThe SEC held out against a spot bitcoin ETF for nearly a decade, but in late 2021 it allowed ProShares to launch the first of several ETFs that hold bitcoin futures.\n\nAfter Grayscale filed its lawsuit, well-known ETF providers began filing their own applications and the SEC started working with them to fine tune their proposals. In recent months, the issuers have spelt out how they will protect investors from market manipulation, identified some of the financial institutions that will create and redeem shares and shifted to the cash-based method of creation.\n\nThe SEC has been \u201cone of the most sceptical regulators in the world and has gotten to the finish line and approved it\u201d, Wood said. \u201cAnd you know there\u2019s been a lot of battle testing going on around this.\u201d\n\nThis article has been amended since publication to reflect that 11 ETFs have been cleared for listing, not 10"

        "content": "Following the recently reported hack of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2019s social media account yesterday (10 January 2024), the SEC formally announced that it had approved the launch of 11 Bitcoin ETFs in the US.\n\nAs the announcement states, these approvals are not an endorsement of cryptocurrency as an \u201cinvestment\u201d or of any of the issuers of the ETFs themselves.\n\n\u201cIt should in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities. Nor does the approval signal anything about the Commission\u2019s views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws.\u201d\n\nThe Chair of the SEC went further and stated that (in contrast to assets such as metals, which have \u201cconsumer and industrial uses), \u201cbitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing.\u201d\n\nThose of you who have followed the SEC\u2019s approach to cryptocurrency during under its current Chair\u2019s tenure, will find it no surprise that the announcement also made clear that \u201cthe vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to federal securities laws.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the reason the SEC finally approved bitcoin ETFs, is that it was forced to do so and that it is making the best of a difficult situation.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2023, the SEC received (and refused) applications for the launch of 20 spot bitcoin ETFs. One of those filings was by Grayscale, which proposed converting its bitcoin trust into a ETF. When this application was refused, Grayscale appealed and the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \u201cheld that the [SEC] failed to adequately explain its reasoning in disapproving the listing and trading of the Grayscale\u2019s proposed ETP.\u201d\n\nThe SEC was then in the position that it had to reconsider applications \u2013 and provide \u201cadequate\u201d reasoning for further approvals \u2013 or bring spot bitcoin into the ETF market where it would be subject to investor protection rules and transparency obligations. A ETF/ETP happens also to be a \u201csecurity\u201d which would satisfy the SEC Chair that he had brought crypto assets within his commission\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nWhat is a ETF or ETP?\n\nA ETF/ETP is a pooled investment vehicle which operates like a mutual fund. They track the price/value of an underlying asset (in this case, the price of bitcoin) without the investor needing to have direct exposure to the underlying. The \u201cE\u201d in ETF/ETP refers to the investment being exchange-traded. The price of the ETF\u2019s shares will change during the day as its shares are bought and sold on the market.\n\nHow to ETFs and ETPs work?\n\nETFs benefit from a process called creation/redemption. Creation is the buying of the underlying asset (in this cash bitcoin) and wrapping them into the traditional exchange-traded fund structure. Redemption is the process by which the underlying assets are unwrapped from the structure.\n\nThe process for creation and redemption is controlled by the ETF sponsor and third parties which in other structures would be called market-makers but in the ETF context are called \u201cauthorised participants\u201d (APs). APs create ETF shares by assembling blocks of the underlying assets and delivering them to the ETF sponsor/issuer. In return, the sponsor bundles the underlying into an ETF wrapper and delivers ETF shares to the AP. These newly-created shares are then introduced to the listed secondary market, where they can be bought and sold.\n\nRedemption is the reverse of this process: ETF shares are bought by the AP (taking them out of the secondary market) and delivered to the ETF sponsor in exchange for the underlying of an equivalent value (i.e. the sponsor delivers bitcoin to the AP).\n\nWhy are bitcoin ETFs so important?\n\nFirst, any ETF permits investors to gain some exposure to the market for the underlying without having to own the underlying itself. These approvals will permit institutions to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies and it will permit retail investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies with the protections afforded by the fact that they are buying/selling regulated securities on a regulated market.\n\nWhat next?\n\nBitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency or crypto asset. The likelihood is that the next round of ETF applications will be for spot ether. We understand that major ETF issuers and sponsors have applied for ether ETFs in the last few months \u2013 the applications will be working their way through the SEC\u2019s approval process. If those applications are approved (about which the industry is bullish), then the likelihood is that the next few years will see the launch of ETFs with a great variety of crypto asset underlyings.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of bitcoin ETFs also is likely to prompt other regulators around the globe to follow suit."

        "title": "Why Some Crypto Experts Predict Bitcoin Will Soar to Record Highs in 2024 - Money",
        "content": "The new year is starting off strong for crypto: Bitcoin prices are hovering around $45,000, their highest in almost two years. But can the digital currency continue to rise, or will the streak of gains it kept up through the past year peter out?\n\nThe last 12 months have seen a comeback for both bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry at large. While 2022 was fraught with controversial headlines (FTX collapse, anyone?) and price troughs, 2023 saw bitcoin values rise by over 155%. At least some of this success can be chalked up to an improving overall economy; job gains, the deceleration of inflation and the prospect of interest rate cuts this year have helped to bolster stocks, which have been shown to follow similar price patterns as cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, that's all in the past \u2014 anything can happen in 2024. Where are bitcoin prices likely to go this year? Here\u2019s what experts are saying.\n\nBitcoin ETFs and halving event cause great expectations\n\nThe biggest bitcoin-related event of the year is set to occur this spring, and experts think it could be a boon to prices. Every four years, a change to the cryptocurrency\u2019s infrastructure comes via a bitcoin halving.\n\nBitcoin is created through a mathematical process called \u201cmining.\u201d Miners use computers to solve math problems for a reward of newly minted bitcoin. When a halving event occurs, the total bitcoin reward is cut in half \u2014 meaning it then takes twice as much effort as before to earn the same number of coins. Historically, bitcoin halving events have preceded major gains; when the last one occurred in May 2020, prices rose by over 200% by the end of that year.\n\nAnother major event just happened: the long-awaited approval of a bitcoin spot ETF. These crypto-centric exchange-traded funds will allow investors to purchase a stake in bitcoin without having to directly own the asset. On Wednesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 companies' bitcoin spot ETF applications; now, many believe these funds will bring bitcoin to the investing mainstream in a big way.\n\n\u201cETF approvals and the upcoming halving could make 2024 a record year for cryptocurrencies,\u201d says Ben Weiss, co-founder of crypto ATM provider CoinFlip. \u201cAs such, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if bitcoin breaks six figures.\u201d\n\nWeiss adds that the ETF approvals are likely to pull large investing institutions into crypto, \u201ccausing a positive feedback loop between price and demand\u201d to the benefit of investors.\n\nDan Weiskopf, co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, puts similar stock in these two events as major price determinants over the next year.\n\n\u201cWe see bitcoin reaching new highs in 2024 because of more institutional access through ETFs and a broader narrative as a store of value,\u201d Weiskopf says, adding that the halving and further regulation of the cryptocurrency industry are likely to produce positive results for investors.\n\nIn addition, there\u2019s plenty of evidence out there to suggest that cryptocurrency price movements are influenced heavily by the stock market. Improving economic factors outside of crypto, then, could be good signs for bitcoin prices.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve's policies and the broader governmental stance on monetary issues will play a significant role in shaping the crypto market landscape,\u201d says Martin Leinweber, digital assets product specialist at MarketVector Indexes.\n\nIndeed, crypto benefited during 2023 in spite of the Fed's interest rate hikes. The central bank's upcoming cuts, which would make the cost of borrowing money cheaper, could make tailwinds even stronger for speculative assets like bitcoin because they typically raise investors\u2019 tolerance for risk.\n\nAds by Money.

Learn More\n\nWhere will bitcoin prices go?\n\nAll of these factors are creating a lot of excitement among experts, but it's crucial to keep in mind that many crypto experts are perpetual optimists, especially when it comes to wider adoption of the technology.\n\nWith that in mind, the popular opinion among those interviewed seems to be that bitcoin is bound to break its record price of almost $69,000 \u2014 or go even beyond that.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a high probability that a new all-time high will be reached this year,\u201d says Bob Ras, co-creator of cryptocurrency company Sologenic.\n\nEven if the ETF approval doesn't kick off a bullish run, Ras says \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of room for bitcoin to run here.\u201d Similarly, Weiskopf says that \u201cthe previous high set of $68,000 last November 2021 will be eclipsed, and then we are off to higher round numbers.\u201d\n\nThat in itself is a bullish prediction. If bitcoin were to rise to its old all-time high by this December, it would mean a return of almost 63% on the year \u2014 six times bigger than the average S&P 500 annualized return of around 10%.\n\nThere are other, even bolder predictions being made, as well. Leinweber, for instance, has a median forecast that places the cryptocurrency\u2019s median price at $150,000.\n\nThis story was updated Wednesday afternoon to include news of the SEC's bitcoin spot ETF approval.\n\nNewsletter Make smarter money decisions in just a few minutes every day Subscribe to Daily Money to get more of the latest personal finance news, stories, and analysis delivered everyday to your inbox.

        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday the FBI is investigating the hack of the agency\u2019s social media account that rocked the bitcoin world earlier this week ahead of the regulator\u2019s approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund late Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe SEC continues to investigate the matter and is coordinating with appropriate law enforcement entities, including the SEC\u2019s Office of the Inspector General and the FBI,\u201d an SEC spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe SEC said that the \u201cunauthorized content\u201d on the agency\u2019s verified account on X (formerly known as Twitter) was \u201cnot drafted or created by the SEC.\u201d\n\nBitcoin prices briefly jumped on Tuesday after the SEC\u2019s account on X posted a message saying the regulator approved multiple bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSEC approval has been highly anticipated by crypto investors as it would help bring bitcoin further into the mainstream and make it easier for people to buy. One crypto exchange, Coinbase, even posted a celebratory message on social media Tuesday.\n\nHowever, 15 minutes later SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the agency\u2019s account was \u201ccompromised,\u201d allowing for an \u201cunauthorized\u201d tweet to get posted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that unauthorized access to SEC accounts could undermine our markets and the agency\u2019s mission,\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nBrown said he expects the SEC to keep the committee updated and encouraged the Office of the SEC Inspector General to look into the incident as well.\n\nRepublican Sens. JD Vance and Thom Tillis slammed the SEC in a letter to Gensler on Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that the agency entrusted with regulating the epicenter of the world\u2019s capital markets would make such a colossal error,\u201d they wrote.\n\nRegulating the regulator\n\nThe false announcement could have had huge, market-moving implications: ETFs for bitcoin could drive as much as $100 billion in investment this year if approved, said Nick Smart, director of intelligence at Crystal Blockchain.\n\nBitcoin and other digital assets experienced significant price fluctuations after the fake message was posted Tuesday: Bitcoin prices shot up by more than 2.5% before falling again as the news crossed and misinformation quickly spread across various media platforms. On Wednesday, after the SEC released its official decision to approve an ETF, the cryptocurrency rose by 0.3% to nearly $46,000, according to data on coinmarketcap.com.\n\nA spokesperson for X later said that the SEC\u2019s social media account lacked the basic security measure of two-factor authentication, raising serious questions about the agency\u2019s cybersecurity protocols.\n\nThat alleged lack of security is particularly befuddling, given the SEC\u2019s previous ruling that social media posts could serve as public announcements for investors.\n\nThe financial community is closely monitoring the SEC\u2019s response to this breach, which could lead to significant changes in how financial information is disseminated in the digital age.\n\nAdditional reporting by Nicole Goodkind"

        "content": "The draw of most ETFs \u2013 especially those tracking stock indexes \u2013 is that they offer a diversified array of assets in one purchase. A fund focused only on bitcoin obviously will see the volatile swings bitcoin investors have long been accustomed to. However, a bitcoin ETF could open the door to similar products featuring other cryptocurrencies, so there may come a time when an investor can buy a single ETF share that represents a wide swath of crypto names."

        "title": "First Bitcoin ETFs approved by US regulators - The Verge",
        "content": "\u201cWhile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse Bitcoin,\u201d said SEC chairman Gary Gensler, in a statement. \u201cInvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\u201d\n\nFor the last 10 years, the SEC has denied every attempt to create a Bitcoin ETF, which is a bundle of assets that sort of works like a mutual fund. Unlike a mutual fund, though, these vehicles trade on exchanges, where stock market participants can easily buy and sell them. That\u2019s crucial here \u2014 it means, basically, you can invest in Bitcoin without the bother of setting up your own wallet.\n\nThat might be enough for certain kinds of investors who\u2019ve been sitting on the sidelines to take the plunge into cryptocurrency. Crypto investors have been frothing about this \u2014 because in order to back their funds, the companies that issue ETFs will have to buy matching amounts of Bitcoin.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin hardly budged on today\u2019s news. In the long run, however, a Bitcoin ETF makes it easier for traditional institutional investors to enter crypto. Pension funds and insurance funds, for instance, might be able to speculate on Bitcoin price for the first time, which would push up demand for Bitcoin.\n\nRight now, the proxy for investing in cryptocurrency has been buying shares of crypto-focused companies such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy, which owns more than $8 billion of Bitcoin as of January. The entrance of a Bitcoin ETF may make those companies less valuable.\n\nUntil recently, the SEC has rejected applications for Bitcoin ETFs, saying they aren\u2019t safe enough for investors. But last April, a court ruled that the SEC\u2019s denial of a Grayscale ETF was \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d clearing the way for today\u2019s approval. An ETF of Bitcoin futures already exists, after all."

        "content": "Bitcoin prices have been soaring amid reports that spot bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) could soon hit the market.\n\nThe price of the largest cryptocurrency by market value climbed as high as $47,900 Tuesday evening after a tweet on the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) suggested the regulatory agency approved a spot bitcoin ETF. However, the SEC immediately issued a follow-up tweet that indicated its X page was hacked and that the tweet was fake. Bitcoin prices quickly turned tail.\n\nStill, Bitcoin has more than doubled over the past 12 months \u2013 effectively ending the crypto winter from 2022 \u2013 and is now trading at levels not seen in nearly two years. \"Bitcoin has stormed higher again \u2026 on the back of more ETF chat,\" says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA . \"There's clearly a lot of excitement about the prospect of a bitcoin spot ETF, as is evident by such a surge on speculation of something that was already expected to eventually get over the line.\"\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Sign up\n\nBitcoin was little changed late Wednesday after the SEC actually did approve rule changes that will allow for spot bitcoin ETFs to begin trading in U.S. markets, paving the way for institutional investors and retail traders to more easily access exposure to the cryptocurrency.\n\nThis follows a major ruling last summer from a federal appeals court that overturned the SEC's attempt to block Grayscale Investments' application for a spot bitcoin ETF. Judge Neomi Rao said the SEC's decision to approve two bitcoin future ETFs but reject the application for the spot market fund was \"arbitrary and capricious.\" This effectively paved the way for today's decision.\n\nWhat's the difference between a spot vs futures ETF?\n\nIn 2021, cryptocurrency traders scored a win when the SEC approved the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) \u2013 the first crypto ETF on the market that was not tied to stocks. The fund was so popular it accumulated more than $1 billion in assets under management by its second day.\n\nThere are plenty of other Bitcoin and crypto ETFs on the market, but none that are tied to a digital asset's spot price \u2013 or where it is trading at right now so that it can be bought for immediate delivery. This differs from futures prices, which are where the cryptocurrency is expected to be trading in the future. Futures traders buy contracts that lock in this price for a delivery of the asset at a later date.\n\nThe SEC had previously rejected approving a spot bitcoin ETF, citing risks such as market manipulation and fraud.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs will drive demand by investment advisors and wealth and private banking integrated products, as well as provide easier access to ETFs in direct broker accounts, says Gautam Chhugani , senior analyst of Global Digital Assets at Bernstein. The analyst thinks total managed crypto assets will reach $500 billion to $600 billion over the next five years, up from the current $45 billion to $50 billion.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe ruling likely won't have a negative impact on the crypto industry, says Julius de Kempenaer , senior technical analyst at Stockcharts.com. \"It opens up access to a broader group of participants which means more turnover, more adaptation and very likely in-flow from investors who so far have not taken the plunge to allocate to crypto for various reasons.\"\n\nAs for any negatives, \"the only thing I can come up with is when there would be very strict regulations, restrictions and policies attached to buying and selling the bitcoin ETFs,\" de Kempenaer adds.\n\nFollowing today's decision, spot bitcoin ETFs could start trading as soon as tomorrow, January 11. A number of firms including Grayscale, Ark Invest and Fidelity have already submitted paperwork to launch their own funds.\n\nThe high demand among asset managers is good news for investors as many issuers are cutting their fees on the bitcoin funds. Invesco, for instance, is waiving the 0.59% fee for its Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) for the six months on the first $5 billion in assets.\n\nShould I buy a bitcoin ETF?\n\n\"Bitcoin ETFs give investors a sense of security \u2013 there's a layer of protection,\" says Karim Nurani , chief strategy officer at private investing firm Linqto . \"Most people still regard cryptocurrency as a wildly volatile and unsafe asset class and they're discouraged by the complexity of self-custody and the ever-present danger of cryptocurrency hacks, scams and exploits. Having trusted financial entities provide spot bitcoin ETF mitigates these risks and responsibilities.\"\n\nInvestors may not want to rush out and scoop up shares of these new ETFs , though. At the moment, cryptocurrencies remain highly speculative and should be approached with extreme caution. For market participants interested in dipping their toes into the crypto space, it is crucial that they do their research and only use money they can afford to lose.\n\nOne benefit of buying exchange-traded funds is that they spread risk across a basket of assets. However, when it comes to crypto ETFs, this is likely more true for funds that are made up of stocks vs those that are tied to futures or spot prices of a digital currency."
