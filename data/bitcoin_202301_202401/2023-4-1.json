        "title": "Crypto evangelists enter the Bukele government: The dark business of bitcoin in El Salvador - EL PA\u00cdS USA",
        "content": "American crypto evangelist Max Keizer has compared Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to John F. Kennedy and El Salvador to the kingdom of Camelot, describing it as a kind of promised land for bitcoin where taxes and central banks are sleighed like dragons. Until a few months ago, Keizer \u2014 an American former stockbroker and reporter close to Russian propaganda sites \u2014 was just another one of the many outlandish characters who began to arrive in the country in 2021, after Bukele announced that El Salvador would be the first in the world to accept bitcoin as legal currency.\n\nMany of those characters \u2014 a mix of anarcho-capitalists, cyber-utopians and plain old opportunists \u2014 left El Salvador as enthusiasm for the bitcoin project began to wane. Only 14% of the country\u2019s businesses have ever used bitcoin, according to official figures. But those characters who are still in the country have gone in all the way \u2014 people like Keizer and his wife, Stacy Herbert. Since the end of last year, Keizer and Hebert have been in charge of the country\u2019s National Bitcoin Office. El Salvador, one of the smallest and poorest countries in the region, has crypto evangelists within the government.\n\nMax Keizer waves a Salvadoran flag at a cryptocurrency conference in Miami on April 7, 2022. Rebecca Blackwell (AP)\n\nThe creation of the National Bitcoin Office, like the rest of Bukele\u2019s crypto project and much of his government\u2019s management, is shrouded in secrecy. The only figures that have been made public are the $200 million that was spent on the infrastructure to launch the digital currency, such as bitcoin ATMs and a cellphone app. Beyond what Bukele has announced on Twitter, it also not known much the country has invested in bitcoin. Like Bukele, Keiser and Herbet are also active on social media, with more than 700,000 followers. Their YouTube shows and podcasts are the main source of information on El Salvador\u2019s bitcoin policies.\n\nStacy Herbert at a cryptocurrency conference in Dublin, Ireland, on June 12, 2018. Stephen McCarthy (Getty Images)\n\nKeiser and Herbert both present themselves as some kind of crypto police or crypto judges. They are authorized to investigate possible fraud, and they are the ones who decide which investor is allowed in and which is not. \u201cWe do not receive any salary for this. We do it for President Bukele,\u201d Herbert often says, while her husband calls their work \u201can act of love.\u201d Leaving aside their alleged altruism, the couple owns Heisenberg Capital, a fund belonging to Bitfinex, one of the world\u2019s largest platforms for buying and selling bitcoin. And they also own El Zonte Capital, another fund dedicated exclusively to digital investments in El Salvador.\n\nPropaganda and corporate diplomacy\n\nRicardo Valencia, professor of Political Economy at California State University, argues that for Keiser and Herbert, \u201cthe true value of the office is not monetary, but for propaganda and corporate diplomacy.\u201d The National Bitcoin Office is attached to the Presidency of the Republic and has the power to establish international relations. Valencia, who is also a specialist in communication, points out that \u201cit has the ability to design public policies that are mandatory for other ministries in the country and grants Keizer and Herbert official titles to inaugurate bitcoin embassies in Europe and the United States.\u201d\n\nTexas and Switzerland have already welcomed Salvadoran bitcoin embassies, which work in parallel to official diplomacy channels. \u201cA network of apocryphal diplomats is being built that will serve to spread official and corporate propaganda. It is an exchange of favors within the patrimonial use of the state. In El Salvador, there is no difference between Bukele\u2019s personal deposits and public finances,\u201d adds Valencia. Given the risks involved with bitcoin, such as its great volatility and lack of transparency, Bukele\u2019s decision to make the cryptocurrency legal tender has sparked sharp rebuke from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), ratings agencies and even the U.S. government.\n\nFarmers demonstrate against the adoption of Bitcoin as legal currency on the Pan-American highway, in September 2021. Salvador Melendez (AP)\n\nBitcoin City\n\nIn June 2021, Bukele announced that bitcoin would be the official currency in his country, along with the dollar. He made the announcement during the Bitcoin Conference in Miami, a large-scale event with concerts, sumo wrestlers, televangelist-style presentations and slogans such as \u201cdeath to the dollar\u201d and \u201ceveryone against the Federal Reserve.\u201d Crypto evangelists criticize the state because they consider it the enemy of what they call \u201cindividual sovereignty.\u201d For them, neither Elon Musk nor Mark Zuckerberg are disruptive enough. They understand life in society as a jungle or a casino, where practically the only law is the direct exchange of digital money.\n\nBukele also shares this messianic tone and flashy exhibitionism. At the end of 2021, Bukele hosted Bitcoin Week in El Salvador \u2014 an event that tried to emulate the vibe of the Miami conference. At the party to celebrate the end of the event, Bukele took to the main stage, at the foot of the beach, while a giant screen projected in neon blue letters: \u201cThe President.\u201d Laser lights, smoke cannons and fireworks went off as the president took the microphone: \u201cWhen Alexander the Great was conquering the world, he decided to establish 20 Alexandrias throughout his empire. These cities were beacons of hope for the rest of the planet. We must establish our first Alexandria here, in El Salvador. Let\u2019s build Bitcoin City.\u201d\n\nBukele announces Bitcoin City, on November 20, 2021. Salvador Melendez (AP)\n\nBukele said his Bitcoin City would be powered by geothermal energy from a nearby volcano, and that the money to set up schools, hospitals and the rest of the services needed would come from so-called volcano bonds or bitcoin bonds: new Salvadoran public debt securities backed by bitcoin. A year and a half after the announcement, El Salvador \u2014 turning a deaf ear to the IMF\u2019s warnings \u2014 has prepared a law that will allow it to raise $1 billion via bitcoin-backed bonds. Keizer and Herbert have played a key role in this process. According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal, Bitfinex \u2014 the parent company of their two funds \u2014 will provide not only the technological platform for the bonds, but will also request a license to operate as a trader.\n\nBut Keizer and Herbert are not the only influential figures from the crypto world who have collaborated in implementing El Salvador\u2019s bitcoin transition. Jack Mallers, a 27-year-old who created an application for instant money transfers via bitcoin, was one of the president\u2019s closest advisers in drafting the law that formally introduced the currency to the country. Like Keizer and Herbert, he also had a vested interest in El Salvador\u2019s bitcoin project: he was hoping his application would be able to gain ground in the country\u2019s remittance market. Some 20% of El Salvador\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) comes from money that is sent by Salvadorians living abroad, especially in the U.S. But the project did not work out, and according to sources close to Mallers, he has not set foot in the country again.\n\nA scale model of Bitcoin City shared by Bukele on social media. Nayib Bukele via Twitter\n\nOnly 2% of remittances are transferred via bitcoin, according to data from the Central Bank. And around 70% of Salvadorans do not even have a bank account. \u201cFinancial inclusion was one of the objectives of the bitcoin project. But there is no public policy that develops these objectives,\u201d says economist Tatiana Marroqu\u00edn. \u201cThe other goals were to promote the country\u2019s brand image and the reception of tourists. But with everything that has happened with bitcoin in recent months \u2014falling prices, financial fraud \u2014 El Salvador\u2019s financial profile has fallen instead of rising.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has lost 40% of its value in the past year. And since Bukele announced that it would be legal tender, the IMF has been issuing more and more warnings. The last warning was in response to the imminent issuance of the so-called volcano bonds. In a statement last month, the international institution stressed: \u201cGiven the legal risks, fiscal fragility and largely speculative nature of crypto markets, the authorities should reconsider their plans to expand government exposures to Bitcoin, including by issuing tokenized bonds.\u201d\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n\n\n"

Bitcoin holds its perch above $28K. Other major cryptos mostly fall in weekend trading.\n\nInsights: Decentralized-focused tokens soared during the quarter. Their gains came as U.S. regulators zeroed in on centralized exchanges.\n\nPrices\n\nCoinDesk Market Index (CMI)\n\n1,208\n\n\u221213.8 \u25bc 1.1%\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\n$28,045\n\n\u2212377.2 \u25bc 1.3%\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\n$1,788\n\n\u221228.9 \u25bc 1.6%\n\nS&P 500\n\n4,109.31\n\n+58.5 \u25b2 1.4%\n\nGold\n\n$1,979\n\n+9.6 \u25b2 0.5%\n\nNikkei 225\n\n28,041.48\n\n+258.5 \u25b2 0.9%\n\nBTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)\n\nBitcoin Investors Continue Their Watchful Waiting\n\nWill April bring showers or more sunshine for bitcoin?\n\nThe weekend offered few clues as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization kicked off the new month holding at late March levels as investors weighed recent events \u2013 bank failures, inflation and crypto-focused regulatory actions \u2013 that could push prices higher or drag them down.\n\nBTC was recently trading at $28,045, down 1.3% over the past 24 hours. It rose roughly 21% in March, despite a turbulent last two weeks in which markets teetered at times but always seemed to snap back above the $28,000 threshold.\n\n\"Bitcoin has remained resilient over the last week or so, resulting in a general improvement in market sentiment,\" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.\n\nDiPasquale noted that bitcoin was trading above its 200-day moving average, \"historically a strong indicator of bullish price action.\"\n\nBut he also reflected uncertainty about BTC's path forward, calling \"the $32K to $36K range ... an area of interest on the upside while $18K to $20K ... a strong range on the downside.\"\n\nEther was also slightly up from the previous day to change hands at $1,788, down 1.6% but well within its range of the past two weeks. Ethereum developers now await the Shanghai upgrade, which is scheduled to occur April 12 and will mark Ethereum\u2019s full transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network, enabling staked ETH withdrawals. Other cryptos in the top 25 by market value were largely in the red.\n\nStory continues\n\nARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, recently fell 7.4% to trade at $1.19. The decline came amid an uproar in the Arbitrum community over how the Arbitrum Foundation \u2013 a centralized company charged with promoting Arbitrum's claimed decentralized ecosystem \u2013 held a \"ratification\" vote over decisions it had already implemented, including sending nearly $1 billion in tokens to itself. On Sunday, the foundation said would break up its controversial governance package into a series of separate votes, bending to community pressure.\n\nPopular meme coins DOGE and SHIB were recently off 5.5% and 4.8%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets overall performance was recently down 1.2%.\n\nEquity markets closed an eventful, largely upbeat first quarter on a high with the tech-focused Nasdaq climbing 1.7% and the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rising 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively.\n\nThis week, investors will have a fresh set of employment and productivity data to gauge whether the U.S. economy is continuing to contract as recent signs have suggested or powering forward. The U.S. Census Bureau will release February durable goods orders on Tuesday, with expectations for a 1% month-over-month decline, and on Friday the U.S. Labor Department will announce March's nonfarm payrolls, with expectations for a 225,000-job spike, and the monthly unemployment rate, which is expected to remain at its current 3.6%. A hot jobs market has figured prominently in central bankers' contemplations about the ongoing strength of the economy, which historically leads to higher inflation readings.\n\nIn an interview with CoinDesk TV, Marc Chandler, Bannockburn Global Forex managing director and chief market strategist, said that \"the financial stress that we saw earlier this month is receding.\"\n\n\"This is allowing the market to focus on two things, which was before the banking stress,\" he said, adding a note of caution. \"One is that the labor market remains fairly robust. And inflation is too high for the Federal Reserve.\"\n\nBiggest Gainers\n\nAsset Ticker Returns DACS Sector XRP XRP +3.0% Currency Decentraland MANA +1.9% Entertainment\n\nBiggest Losers\n\nInsights\n\nA Banner Quarter for Decentralized-Focused Tokens\n\nA growing fear that centralized crypto infrastructure will be the target of U.S. regulators has driven tokens that provide decentralized alternatives to be some of the best performers this past quarter.\n\n(CoinMarketCap)\n\nCoinMarketCap data shows that tokens for protocols LidoDAO (LDO), dYdX (DYDX), and GMX (GMX) were some of the best performers over the last 90 days.\n\nLDO surged in February when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered Kraken to shut down its staking service and continued to rally when Coinbase\u2019s CEO Brian Armstrong said a blanket staking ban was coming alongside a securities classification \u2013 a scarlet letter for any sort of crypto with U.S. exposure.\n\nAs for DYDX and GMX, the demise of FTX gave the market a renewed interest in decentralized derivatives exchanges.\n\n\u201cFTX and [sister company] Alameda, as far as we know, were incredibly centralized, controlled by a single person. These things metastasize because of human error,\u201d Dan Gunsberg, creator of Solana-based derivatives exchange Hxro, said to CoinDesk in December.\n\nLike staking, there\u2019s also significant regulatory interest in derivatives. Binance was recently sued by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and its derivatives trading desk was front-and-center in the suit. Traders are looking for decentralized alternatives, which they feel are beyond the big-guns of American regulators and outside the crypto war conflict zone.\n\nBut decentralized derivative exchanges also have their problems too. As CoinDesk recently reported, many are struggling with liquidity and a lack of available open interest means that they cannot sustain big orders. While not all decentralized derivative exchanges suffer from this problem, it does cast some doubt on how well the idea scales.\n\nWhile decentralization was a theme for the quarter\u2019s best performers, the actual token that took first place was Conflux (CFX), up a whopping 1,622%, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear what\u2019s driving such an outsized gain. Sure, Conflux\u2019s Blockchain SIM card has attracted some interest from investors, but right now its all theoretical and still in a trial phase. On-chain data shows that the number of transactions on the CFX chain are lower than what they were a year ago.\n\nBut, this is crypto. And sometimes there\u2019s not discernable data behind a token that pumps.\n\nImportant events\n\n9:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:00 UTC) Australia TD Securities Inflation (YoY/March)\n\n3:55 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:55 UTC) Germany S&P Global/BME Manufacturing PMI (March)\n\n10:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(14:00 UTC) United States ISM Manufacturing PMI (March)\n\nCoinDesk TV\n\nIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of \"First Mover\" on CoinDesk TV:\n\nBitcoin Slips as Fed's Preferred Inflation Gauge Rose 0.3% in February; What's Next for Binance?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was hovering around $28,000 as the PCE price index increased 0.3 percent in February.

At all.\n\nBitcoin Booty\n\nAhoy swashbuckling spacefarers: if you're hunting for off-world treasure, look no further than the Moon.\n\nAs spotted by Gizmodo, the crypto company LunarCrush says it'll be leaving a bounty of 62 Bitcoin near the lunar south pole that's completely up for grabs. So in theory, any adventurer daring enough to hitch a ride to the Moon can snatch up the booty for themselves, which hopefully will still be worth anywhere near the purported $1.5 million it's valued at now (don't necessarily count on that, though). The sticker price won't even come close to the exorbitant travel expenses for getting there and back, but hey, it's the novelty that counts, right?\n\nThe goal of this stunt is to \"inspire people to build communities that will unlock a new era of exploration,\" according to LunarCrush CEO Joe Vezzani. \"It's like Willy Wonka's 'golden ticket' for the Web3 era, and we couldn't be more excited to see how it all unfolds,\" he said in a press release. Uh yeah, sure.\n\nThe bounty is called Nakomoto_1, named after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin \u2014 but it's not actually some space-shielded hard drive with Bitcoin sitting in it. Instead, it's merely a key to a private crypto wallet, engraved on a hidden portion of a lunar rover called the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform, or MAPP, which is decidedly less cool than unearthing a real treasure chest.\n\nActual Mission\n\nThe MAPP rover, however, isn't there just to be a glorified crypto receptacle, and it certainly doesn't belong to LunarCrush \u2014 that's way out of the platform's budget.\n\nA creation of the space company Lunar Outpost, its real purpose is part of Tipping Point, a NASA-backed campaign to get private companies to flex their tech in space in the hopes of furthering commercial spacefaring capabilities and infrastructure, which includes having Nokia set up the first 4G network on the Moon.\n\nThe rover and its crypto bounty will be brought to the Moon aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch scheduled for June. Once it's there, MAPP will deploy around the lunar south pole, where it will be used to test Nokia's wireless network for two weeks. Once the mission's over, the rover will simply be abandoned, at which point it and its bounty will be at the mercy of any motivated off-world crypto bros.\n\nAs of now, LunarCrush is still trying to raise funds for the bounty by selling NFTs, so you might want to hold off until LunarCrush can put its money where its mouth is.\n\nMore on crypto: It Turns Out FTX and Alameda Owe Margaritaville a Staggering Amount of Money"

An asset's market cap is determined by multiplying the asset's total supply by its current price.\n\nMany years ago, Bitcoin had 100% of the entire crypto market share, as there was a period in which it was the only tradeable asset. But with the introduction of Ethereum and other altcoins, Bitcoin dominance continued to drop. However, despite the thousands of altcoins on the market, Bitcoin's dominance is yet to be topped.\n\nHow Is BTC market dominance calculated?\n\nDue to the cryptos volatile nature, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance isn't fixed and is ever changing. For instance, at the end of March 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap was about $543 billion. At the same time, the global crypto market cap was $1.18 trillion.\n\nThe Bitcoin dominance is the percentage that is calculated by dividing Bitcoin\u2019s market share by the total market capitalization. Let's do the maths below:\n\nBitcoin Market Cap ($543 billion) \u00f7 Global Crypto Market Cap ($1.18 trillion) x 100% = 46%. In this example, the BTC dominance ratio as a percentage is 46%.\n\nHowever, there's also a term called \"Real BTC Dominance\u201d. In this case, traders don't compare BTC's market cap with the global crypto market. Instead, it's compared with the combined market cap of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. Some of these include Litecoin, Dogecoin and Bitcoin Cash. This method narrows BTC's performance to similar cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe relationship between Bitcoin dominance and market cap\n\nBitcoin dominance allows crypto traders to understand the trend of BTC and altcoins like Ethereum. Since BTC has the largest market share, it's easy to see the influence Bitcoin has on other altcoins. BTC's dominance has an inverse relationship with the market cap of other coins.\n\nFor instance, when Bitcoin dominance increases, the total market share of other cryptocurrencies reduces in value. Similarly, when BTC dominance reduces, the altcoin dominance increases.\n\nFactors influencing Bitcoin dominanceAs stated earlier, Bitcoin dominance isn't fixed. The value changes from time to time due to various factors. Some of these influencing factors are highlighted below:\n\nMarket volatility\n\nArguably the most influential factor affecting Bitcoin's dominance is the market's volatility. As previously mentioned, the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. This means the total market cap, including Bitcoin, experiences drastic changes. However, Bitcoin's market dominance can increase even when the total market cap plummets. It ultimately depends on the price movement of the altcoin market. If the value of altcoins takes a greater hit than Bitcoin's, then the Bitcoin dominance will likely rise.\n\nAltcoin performance\n\nSince Ethereum launched in 2015, thousands of other altcoins and tokens have been created. Before this time, Bitcoin was the only primary digital currency, so it enjoyed the entire market share. However, with the addition of more altcoins, the dominance of Bitcoin has been negatively impacted, especially as these assets increase in adoption and price.\n\nStablecoin popularity\n\nWhile BTC is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, its price volatility means investors move their funds from the asset during downturns. They turn to stablecoins. Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) have their values pegged to real-world assets like the USD, gold, and other assets. Because of this, assets like Tether, USD Coin (USDC), and Binance USD (BUSD) have grown in popularity.\n\nRisk-averse investors prefer to use these stablecoins as a store of value during periods of extreme volatility. Investors tend to do this since price swings hardly impact the price of stablecoins. Therefore, as they become more prominent among investors, their market presence increases, negatively impacting BTC dominance\n\nWhat are the uses of BTC dominance?\n\nCrypto traders use Bitcoin dominance for a variety of reasons. Some of them include the following:\n\nRisk-aversion\n\nWhen the Bitcoin dominance increases in value, traders are treading cautiously. This implies they're taking money from risky altcoins and putting it into a more stable asset like Bitcoin. This usually happens during downturns within the market as investors look to hedge their portfolios against decline.\n\nTradeable\n\nBesides being an indicator, the Bitcoin dominance index is also tradable on major cryptocurrency exchanges. It's offered as BTCDOM/USDT in its perpetual futures market. With this, traders can trade Bitcoin's market dominance.\n\nTrack market performance\n\nBitcoin is widely viewed as a measure of the performance of the total market cap in the crypto space. Given this, the broader crypto market capitalization tends to dip when the Bitcoin Dominance Index increases. However, when the BTC Dominance drops, the broader market sees a major uptrend due to increased investment in alternative digital assets like Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and others.\n\nHow to trade crypto using BTC dominance\n\nTrading with BTC dominance is a common practice. The common way to trade crypto using BTC dominance is to identify periods in which altcoins outperform Bitcoin, otherwise known as Altcoin season.\n\nAltcoin season occurs when altcoins experience a significant rise in prices while Bitcoin price stalls for a long period. This often leads to investors plowing their funds in these altcoins and kickstarting an uptrend in prices.\n\nInvestors can identify such periods by using the TradingView Bitcoin Dominance Index. This compares the BTC market capitalization relative to other cryptocurrencies. The end product helps show whether to buy BTC or if altcoins have a stronger trend in the financial landscape.\n\nIn the chart presented below, Bitcoin dominance is significantly rising, showing that an altcoin season is not in play.\n\nSimilarly, BTC dominance can be used to trade or predict cryptocurrency market extremes. When the BTC dominance ratio is very high, history shows that the coin\u2019s price may fall. In contrast, low dominance suggests that the BTC price may experience an uptrend. As such, investors can use this data to determine when to buy or sell BTC.\n\nIs the Bitcoin dominance a reliable indicator?\n\nBitcoin dominance is a common crypto trading analysis tool among investors. It can be a viable tool to identify the market trend since it reflects BTC's strength relative to the broader market. It also provides useful insights into changing market conditions and when to adjust trading strategies. However, like other market data and trends, it does not guarantee that Bitcoin and other altcoins will react in a certain manor. Instead, the Bitcoin dominance index should be used as a guide alongside other market indicators.\n\nIn addition, the crypto market is still witnessing the launch of several more altcoin projects. The more altcoins there are, the less dominance BTC will enjoy due to the increased market share of these projects. This could shrink the market dominance of Bitcoin as more altcoins appear. Nonetheless, it still holds a strong position in the market and can still be used in identifying profitable trading positions.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the Bitcoin dominance index?\n\nThe BTC dominance index is a cryptocurrency market analysis tool. The tool helps investors determine the market trend between Bitcoin and altcoins or other proof-of-work coins.\n\nWhy is BTC dominance important?\n\nBTC Dominance is crucial because it can provide insight into market trends. This way, when the BTC Dominance increases, it signals that investors are playing safe and hedging against riskier assets. When the BTC Dominance drops, it could suggest that investors are taking on riskier assets in hopes of higher profits. This helps traders get a snapshot of the overall market sentiment at a glance.\n\nWhere to check the BTC dominance chart?\n\nThe common place to find the Bitcoin dominance chart is on TradingView. Alternatively, users can use the chart available on CoinMarketCap.\n\nHow long does BTC dominance last?\n\nBTC dominance will last as long as Bitcoin remains the most valuable digital currency. However, the coin's dominance fluctuates from time to time.\n\nHow is Bitcoin dominance calculated?\n\nBitcoin dominance is calculated by dividing Bitcoin\u2019s market cap by the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies, then multiplying by 100%. This gives a percentage value which represents Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market.\n\nWhat factors influence Bitcoin dominance?\n\nSeveral factors can affect Bitcoin dominance, including market volatility, the performance of altcoins, and the popularity of stablecoins. Market volatility can result in drastic changes in the market caps of all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Altcoin performance and the introduction of new altcoins can decrease Bitcoin's dominance, and the increased use of stablecoins can also impact Bitcoin's share of the total market.\n\nWhat does Bitcoin dominance tell us?\n\nBitcoin dominance is a measure of Bitcoin's market share compared to the entire crypto market. When Bitcoin's dominance increases, it indicates that investors may be moving their funds into Bitcoin as a safer investment compared to other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a decrease in Bitcoin dominance could signal that investors are taking on riskier investments in altcoins.\n\nWhat is real BTC dominance?\n\nReal BTC Dominance is a term used to describe a measure of Bitcoin's market cap compared to the combined market cap of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. This method provides a narrower comparison of Bitcoin's performance to similar cryptocurrencies.\n\nIs the Bitcoin dominance a reliable indicator?\n\nBitcoin dominance can provide valuable insights into market trends and can be a useful tool for traders. However, like all market indicators, it is not infallible and should be used in conjunction with other market data and trends.\n\nHow to use BTC dominance for crypto trading?\n\nBTC dominance is commonly used to identify the altcoin season - periods when altcoins outperform Bitcoin. If the BTC dominance is falling, this could signal an altcoin season, and traders may decide to invest in altcoins. Conversely, a rising BTC dominance could indicate a favorable market for Bitcoin.\n\nWhat does the increase in stablecoin popularity mean for BTC dominance?\n\nThe rise in stablecoin popularity can negatively impact BTC dominance. During periods of high market volatility, investors often move their funds into stablecoins, which have their values pegged to real-world assets. This can result in a decrease in Bitcoin's market share.\n\nWhat are the implications of more altcoins launching on BTC dominance?\n\nThe launch of more altcoins could potentially decrease Bitcoin's market dominance, as these new coins increase the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies. However, Bitcoin's dominance could remain high if it continues to be seen as a more stable or reliable investment compared to these new altcoins.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nTHIS ARTICLE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFor many readers, a graduate thesis doesn\u2019t sound like a page-turner, but a lengthy academic paper on Bitcoin written by a U.S. Space Force major has emerged as a popular pick on Amazon.\n\n\u201cSoftwar\u201d asserts that Bitcoin has the potential to play a major role on the world\u2019s geopolitical stage as a military-grade solution for securing information\u2014far different than the monetary use Bitcoin\u2019s network has today.\n\nWritten by Jason Lowery, the report represents the culmination of academic research he conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during a 6-month fellowship sponsored by the Department of Defense. The full title of the piece is \u201cSoftwar: A Novel Theory on Power Projection and the National Strategic Significance of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLowrey's brief biography on Amazon claims that he has advised several senior U.S. officials on Bitcoin-related policy in offices related to the president, Secretary of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThough \u201cSoftwar\u201d doesn\u2019t place within the top 500 books on Amazon\u2019s store, Lowery\u2019s exploration of Bitcoin has hovered around the number one spot in Amazon\u2019s digital currencies category and is currently ranked second in both books on technology and engineering.\n\nThe more than 350-page tome draws on knowledge from various fields, such as anthropology and computer science, to establish and explore Lowery\u2019s \u201cPower Projection Theory.\u201d\n\nEssentially, Lowery posits that the proof-of-work system underlying Bitcoin transaction verification can be leveraged by military powers to impose restrictions on bad actors in a non-lethal through a steep amount of physical work in the form of crunching numbers.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that Bitcoin could represent a \u2018softwar\u2019 or electro cyber-defense protocol, not merely a peer-to-peer electronic cash system,\u201d the book states. \u201cWhile most software can only logically constrain computers, Bitcoin can physically constrain computers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe book\u2019s acknowledgments section gives a nod to some of Bitcoin\u2019s most faithful, including MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor and Peter McCormack.\n\nIn his paper, Lowrey also writes that insufficient reserves of Bitcoin held on behalf of the U.S. government could pose a threat to the nation\u2019s national security if the network becomes utilized as a cyber-security tool.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. does not consider stockpiling strategic Bitcoin reserves, or at the very least encouraging Bitcoin adoption,\u201d he said, \u201cThe U.S. could forfeit a strategically vital power [...] and set itself back in global power dominance.\u201d\n\nGiven that Lowrey\u2019s thesis was published in February and the U.S. announced that it sold $215 million in seized Bitcoin last month, perhaps not every Fed is on the same page.\n\nThe book also includes a disclosure that states the paper is not reflective of any official position held by the DoD, Air Force, or MIT.\n\nOut of the more than 200 ratings \u201cSoftwar\u201d has received on Amazon, a majority gave the book five stars.\n\nBut a few reviews say that Lowrey\u2019s text is lacking due to \u201ctoo much wishful thinking,\u201d \u201carguments based on opinion,\u201d and quotes from \u201cThe Matrix\u201d that \u201cdetract from the seriousness of the topic.\u201d"

        "title": "Has bitcoin benefited from the banking crisis? Not in the way its fans hoped - The Economic Times",
        "content": "Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses Offering College Course Website Indian School of Business ISB Professional Certificate in Product Management Visit IIT Delhi IITD Certificate Programme in Data Science & Machine Learning Visit Indian School of Business ISB Product Management Visit\n\nShortly after Silicon Valley Bank failed this month, the price of bitcoin soared above $25,000, reaching a threshold the digital currency hadn\u2019t touched since June. This week, bitcoin reached nearly $30,000, up 70% for the year.Bitcoin proponents seized on the price rise to argue that the banking crisis was prompting investors to convert traditional currencies into digital coins. One crypto executive hailed the bank failures as \u201cthe end of the USD and the dawn of hyperbitcoinization.\u201d A company that markets bitcoin to investors started putting references to the bank runs in its promotional materials.But despite the fanfare, there is little evidence that the recent banking collapse has generated widespread support for bitcoin as a financial alternative.Instead, the surge in bitcoin\u2019s price was driven by a range of financial trends that have little to do with the technology\u2019s philosophical underpinnings, analysts said. The reasons for the surge include growing optimism that the Federal Reserve may pause interest rate increases, as well as increasing concerns about the safety of so-called stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency intended to maintain a price of $1.\u201cIs there widespread interest in and growth coming into the space? Is it a lot of new money?\u201d asked Ed Moya, a crypto analyst at the trading firm OANDA. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really seem like that\u2019s happening.\u201dBitcoin\u2019s recent rise is also a result of low liquidity, a measure of how easy it is to buy and sell a digital asset without affecting its price, according to an analysis by crypto research firm Kaiko. Since the crypto market cratered last year, fewer large financial firms have been buying and selling bitcoin, making the currency harder to trade. Bitcoin\u2019s price has always been volatile, but in the current market, it can increase or decrease significantly after only a few trades. Last week, bitcoin\u2019s liquidity reached a 10-month low, according to Kaiko.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that because there\u2019s a big price move one way that this is a whole new wave of institutional money or anything like that,\u201d said Conor Ryder, a research analyst for Kaiko. \u201cIt\u2019s more so a liquidity issue.\u201dBitcoin was created after the 2008 financial crisis, which sowed widespread distrust in the banking system. Early proponents trumpeted the new technology as a safer long-term alternative to banks and traditional currencies.That vision never came to fruition. Over the past 15 years, traders have largely treated bitcoin as a speculative investment \u2014 and, in some cases, as a tool for money laundering and other crimes.But the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank \u2014 and the broader crisis it unleashed \u2014 seemed to give credence to the original bitcoin thesis.\u201cBitcoin is a clear winner of the U.S. banking crisis,\u201d a column for crypto publication CoinDesk declared this month.The price of bitcoin has increased about 40% since the fall of Silicon Valley Bank in early March, rising to $28,000 from $20,000. But that\u2019s still far from bitcoin\u2019s peak price of nearly $70,000 in November 2021.And the surge has been fueled partly by problems in other corners of the crypto industry. The banking crisis briefly endangered billions of dollars held by Circle, one of the largest stablecoin issuers, causing investors to panic. Some crypto traders who have held their digital savings as stablecoins are now looking for other options.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing some flows just go out of stablecoins into bitcoin,\u201d said Moya, the crypto analyst.The bank runs also stoked excitement among crypto investors who hoped that the Federal Reserve would slow its interest-rate increases to calm the panic. Over the past year, the increases have crippled the crypto market by making it more expensive to invest money in speculative assets.In a widely shared blog post last week, Molly White, a crypto critic, noted that bitcoin\u2019s price began rising around the time the government announced it would backstop Silicon Valley Bank \u2014 an intervention that some analysts interpreted as a signal that the Fed might take further steps to calm the situation.\u201cIf the spike was fear-driven, I would have expected it to have started during the SVB bank run,\u201d she wrote.Last week, the Fed announced that it would move forward with another rate increase. Bitcoin\u2019s price has stayed relatively flat since then, settling around $28,000.Still, bitcoin proponents said they sensed an opportunity to recruit new adherents.Swan Bitcoin, a financial services firm that helps people invest in bitcoin, has experienced a wave of new customers looking to buy the digital coin as an alternative to keeping money at the bank, said Cory Klippsten, the company\u2019s CEO.\u201cThey\u2019re believers that this will be the global reserve currency,\u201d Klippsten said. \u201cThis is the best moment for bitcoin marketing and bitcoin adoption in its history.\u201dCody Candee, the CEO of startup Bounce, got in touch with Swan this month, hoping to convert a portion of his company\u2019s funds into bitcoin.\u201cHaving a couple percent in bitcoin feels like a really great insurance policy on the U.S. dollar, on the banking system, on the Fed, on the whole infrastructure,\u201d he said.But Candee hesitated to commit fully. Bounce, which runs a network of luggage storage and package pickup locations, raised $12 million in a funding round last year. Candee said he planned to spend only $200,000 on bitcoin.\u201cIf that went substantially down,\u201d he said, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be an impact on the business.\u201d"

Literally.\n\nThe Bitcoin bounty, dubbed as Nakamoto_1, will only be accessible to the first space traveler who reaches the moon and obtains the private key for a crypto wallet engraved on the Lunar Outpost MAPP Rover, which will be launched into space later this year, the company said in an official press release published on March 23.\n\nTo achieve that, LunarCrush partnered with Lunar Outpost, animation studio Golden Wolf, and Bitcoin developer tools company Hiro to fund the project through the sale of an NFT collection. According to the firm, the ultimate goal is to \u201cinspire the next generation of interplanetary exploration.\u201d\n\nThe bounty is available to anyone on Earth\n\nNotably, the project plans to fully document the process of engraving the private key affixed to the rover as a way to ensure complete transparency. Once Lunar Outpost\u2019s MAPP Rover lands on the moon, the bounty is available to anyone on Earth who can devise and execute a plan to reach it.\n\nAs per the press release, the moon mission is part of a larger effort to inspire innovation and exploration.\n\n\u201cWhen you put out a seemingly unachievable goal, the innovation that happens can be incredible,\u201d said Joe Vezzani, CEO of LunarCrush. \u201cOur goal is to inspire people to build communities that will unlock a new era of exploration.\u201d\n\nLunar Outpost\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer, Dr. Forrest Meyen, said,\n\n\u201cWhat may sound outlandish to some will open new frontiers that haven\u2019t been explored outside the mind in a long time. Future generations will look to us as pioneers of interplanetary exploration and adventure.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin bounty will be delivered via a SpaceX rocket in Q4 of this year, but the exact date has not yet been released for security reasons."

The full title of the piece is \u201cSoftwar: A Novel Theory on Power Projection and the National Strategic Significance of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nLowrey's brief biography on Amazon claims that he has advised several senior U.S. officials on Bitcoin-related policy in offices related to the president, Secretary of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThough \u201cSoftwar\u201d doesn\u2019t place within the top 500 books on Amazon\u2019s store, Lowery\u2019s exploration of Bitcoin has hovered around the number one spot in Amazon\u2019s digital currencies category and is currently ranked second in both books on technology and engineering.\n\nDARPA Is Bankrolling Research Into Crypto and National Security\n\nThe more than 350-page tome draws on knowledge from various fields, such as anthropology and computer science, to establish and explore Lowery\u2019s \u201cPower Projection Theory.\u201d\n\nEssentially, Lowery posits that the proof-of-work system underlying Bitcoin transaction verification can be leveraged by military powers to impose restrictions on bad actors in a non-lethal through a steep amount of physical work in the form of crunching numbers.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that Bitcoin could represent a \u2018softwar\u2019 or electro cyber-defense protocol, not merely a peer-to-peer electronic cash system,\u201d the book states. \u201cWhile most software can only logically constrain computers, Bitcoin can physically constrain computers.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe book\u2019s acknowledgments section gives a nod to some of Bitcoin\u2019s most faithful, including MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor and Peter McCormack.\n\nIn his paper, Lowrey also writes that insufficient reserves of Bitcoin held on behalf of the U.S. government could pose a threat to the nation\u2019s national security if the network becomes utilized as a cyber-security tool.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. does not consider stockpiling strategic Bitcoin reserves, or at the very least encouraging Bitcoin adoption,\u201d he said, \u201cThe U.S. could forfeit a strategically vital power [...] and set itself back in global power dominance.\u201d\n\nCoin Center Says RESTRICT Act Could Be Used to Ban Bitcoin\n\nGiven that Lowrey\u2019s thesis was published in February and the U.S. announced that it sold $215 million in seized Bitcoin last month, perhaps not every Fed is on the same page.\n\nThe book also includes a disclosure that states the paper is not reflective of any official position held by the DoD, Air Force, or MIT.\n\nOut of the more than 200 ratings \u201cSoftwar\u201d has received on Amazon, a majority gave the book five stars.\n\nBut a few reviews say that Lowrey\u2019s text is lacking due to \u201ctoo much wishful thinking,\u201d \u201carguments based on opinion,\u201d and quotes from \u201cThe Matrix\u201d that \u201cdetract from the seriousness of the topic.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin price turns $28K to support, opening the door for ETH, MATIC, HBAR and EOS to breakout - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The market witnessed a major banking crisis in March as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed and Silvergate Bank entered liquidation as a result of dire financial distress. In Europe, the government brokered a forced takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS. Still, the United States equities markets and the European stock markets closed the month on a positive note.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market was also shaken by volatility, but Bitcoin (BTC) gained about 23% in March. Going forward, the picture looks encouraging for Bitcoin bulls in April and data from Coinglass suggests that the month has largely favored the buyers.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAlthough altcoins reacted positively to Bitcoin\u2019s rise, the rally has not been equal across the board. This suggests that market participants have been selective in their purchases. As a result, traders might focus on the movers rather than the laggards.\n\nLet\u2019s study the charts of five cryptocurrencies that look positive in the near term. If they break above their resistance levels, they may offer short-term trading opportunities.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin is facing stiff resistance at the $29,000 level but the bulls have not allowed the price to lose ground. This suggests that the bulls are being patient, anticipating a move higher.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day exponential moving average ($27,012) is trending up and the relative strength index (RSI) is above 61, indicating that the buyers are in control. The bullish momentum is likely to pick up after buyers overcome the obstacle at $29,200. That could start a rally to $30,000 and subsequently to $32,500.\n\nConversely, if the price turns down sharply from the current level, it will suggest that the short-term traders are selling. The BTC/USDT pair may slump to the 20-day EMA, which is an important level to keep an eye on.\n\nIf this support gives way, the pair could slide to the breakout level of $25,250. This is a make-or-break level for the pair because if it collapses, the selling could intensify and the decline could extend to the 200-day simple moving average ($20,424).\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBuyers pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $28,868 but could not sustain the higher levels. This suggests that bears are trying to keep the price below $28,868. If bears sustain the price below the 20-EMA, the pair may start its fall toward $27,500 and then to $26,500.\n\nOn the upside, a break and close above $28,868 will indicate that the bulls have overpowered the bears. That could signal the start of the next leg of the up-move. The target objective from the break above the $26,500 to $28,868 range is $31,236.\n\nEther price analysis\n\nEther (ETH) turned down from the overhead resistance of $1,857 on April 1 but the bulls are not giving up much ground. This suggests that the buyers are not rushing to the exit.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($1,748) and the RSI in the positive area suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If bulls drive the price above $1,857, the ETH/USDT pair may make a dash to the psychologically important level of $2,000.\n\nThe bears are likely to mount a strong defense at this level but if bulls overcome this barrier, the next stop could be $2,200. This positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price plunges below the 20-day EMA and the horizontal support at $1,680.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair turned down from the overhead resistance of $1,857, and the bears pulled the price below the 20-EMA. This suggests that the short-term bulls may be closing their positions. The pair could next fall to $1,743 and thereafter to $1,680.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns up and rises back above the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the break may have been a bear trap. A strong bounce off the current level could enhance the prospects of a rally above the overhead resistance.\n\nPolygon price analysis\n\nPolygon (MATIC) has been trading near the 20-day EMA ($1.11) for the past few days. Generally, a tight consolidation near an overhead resistance resolves to the upside.\n\nMATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf buyers thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, the MATIC/USDT pair will attempt a rally to $1.25 and thereafter to $1.30. The bears are expected to guard this zone vigorously because if they fail, the pair could soar to $1.57.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $1.05, it will suggest that the bears are back in the driver\u2019s seat. The pair may then fall to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of $0.97, which is an important level to watch out for. If this support cracks, the pair may plummet toward $0.69.\n\nMATIC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to sustain the price below the 20-EMA. If they succeed, the pair could skid to $1.05 and then to $1.02. This is an important zone for the bulls to defend because if it gives way, the pair may continue its downward move to $0.94.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price turns up from the current level, it will suggest that every minor dip is being purchased. That will increase the likelihood of a break above the minor resistance at $1.15. The pair may then ascend to $1.25.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin copying 'familiar' price trend in 2023, two more metrics show\n\nHedera price analysis\n\nBuyers foiled several attempts by the bears to sink and sustain Hedera (HBAR) below the 200-day SMA ($0.06) between March 9 to 28.\n\nHBAR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($0.06) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that buyers have the upper hand. The HBAR/USDT pair is likely to continue its northward march to the $0.10 to $0.11 resistance zone. Sellers are likely to defend this zone with all their might but if buyers bulldoze their way through, the pair may start a new uptrend.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears are selling on relief rallies. The pair may then retest the crucial support at the 200-day SMA. A break below this level will open the doors for a possible drop to $0.04.\n\nHBAR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls started a strong recovery from the support near $0.06 but the relief rally is facing strong resistance in the zone between the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.07 and the 61.8% retracement level of $0.08.\n\nOn the downside, the bulls are trying to defend the support at the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off it, the pair may rally to $0.09 and then to $0.10. Conversely, if the price plummets below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that bears are still in the game. The pair could then descend to the support near $0.06.\n\nEOS price analysis\n\nEOS (EOS) is trying to complete a bullish cup and handle formation. Buyers pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.15) on March 29, starting a comeback.\n\nEOS/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA has started to turn up gradually and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating a minor advantage to the bulls. The ETH/USDT pair is likely to rise to the overhead resistance zone between $1.26 and $1.34.\n\nSellers are likely to defend this zone aggressively but if bulls overpower the bears, the pair may start a new uptrend. The pattern target of the reversal setup is $1.74.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the overhead zone, it will indicate that bears are selling on rallies. The pair could then slide to the 20-day EMA and later to the 200-day SMA ($1.05). A break below this level will suggest that the bears are back in command.\n\nEOS/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are protecting the $1.22 level with vigor but a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-EMA. This shows strong demand at lower levels.\n\nThe upsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that bulls have a slight edge. If buyers propel the price above $1.22, the pair could rise to $1.26 and thereafter to $1.34.\n\nContrarily, if the price slumps below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that short-term traders may be booking profits. The pair could then drop to $1.14 and later to $1.06.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Put forward by Capriole in 2022, it is based on the Short-to-Long-term Realized Value (SLRV) Ratio from well-known analyst David Puell.\n\nThe SLRV Ratio takes the percentage of the BTC supply active in the last 24 hours and compares it to that last active six to 12 months ago. The result shows how comparatively active short-term supply and long-term supply are at a given point.\n\nFrom this, an investor can gain an insight into both sentiment and likely price trajectory, but over time, such supply values may change, Edwards argues.\n\nRelated: Crypto winter can take a toll on hodlers\u2019 mental health\n\nSLRV Ribbons attempts to address this by analyzing the interplay between two moving averages.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s organic demand has been increasing since spot trading outpaced perpetual trading activity.\n\nThe U.S operation choke 2.0 could impact the April BTC performance.\n\nThe crypto market, led by the quarter-reviving Bitcoin [BTC], had a march full of ups and downs in between cynical and optimistic views. Nevertheless, the king coin ended the month with a 21.49% 30-day hike. However, there has been some development around the market propelled by macroeconomic factors and cycle reversal.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nAs such, the latest Capriole newsletter, put together by Charles Edwards, touched on this aspect.\n\nBumps on the pathway to honor\n\nAccording to the digital asset hedge fund, BTC\u2019s price action has been largely fueled by organic demand. This was because the perpetual dominance has been in a free fall for quite some time.\n\nThe metric describes the established ratio of derivatives trading to spot positions. And with the perpetual dominance down, it meant that spot drove appreciation, and the early bull market stages might be here.\n\nHowever, it is important to admit that the ecosystem struggled with regulatory issues and traditional financial problems.\n\nBut it seemed Bitcoin has been able to withstand the heat. As a matter of fact, these challenges helped raise the Short-to-Long-Term Realized Value (SLRV) ribbons. This implied that short-term market activity outpaced the long-term. In Capriole\u2019s words,\n\n\u201cIn Q4 2022, the ribbons bottomed at levels comparable to the 2018 lows, and have since gone exponential into Q1 2023. This is another clear sign of a macro shift in Bitcoin adoption.\u201d\n\nBitcoin: Crunches, costs, and revival\n\nFurthermore, the report noted that the current liquidity crisis was just one out of two. And the Bitcoin reaction to the first could be similar to the latter part, especially with regulators and institutions out of the U.S. easing their persecution of the digital asset industry.\n\nAnother metric considered to have favored Bitcoin is its production cost. For most of 2022, investments geared toward Bitcoin production were at extreme levels.\n\nWith the end of Q1 here, it means the high costs have outstripped the BTC trading price for more than 365 days. Although this is bad for miners, it serves as confirmation of the coin\u2019s undervalued state.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nThe quantitative Bitcoin algorithm provider opined that the U.S. operation targeted at legit crypto firms to restore banks\u2019 worthiness could derail BTC\u2019s growth in April. However, the coin has proven to detach itself from macroeconomic factors recently. So, there is a chance that it evades these potential sanctions.\n\nLastly, April\u2019s potential to replicate the March performance looks blurry. But the present state of affairs aligns with a recovery trend and potential adoption increase."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been the king of cryptocurrencies since its inception in 2009. With a market cap of over $1 trillion, it\u2019s the most valuable and well-known digital asset in the world.\n\nHowever, BTC has had a rough start in 2023, with its price dropping by more than 40% from its all-time high of nearly $69,000. In this article, we\u2019ll take a closer look at Bitcoin\u2019s price prediction for April 2023. Meanwhile RenQ Finance (RENQ) remains an attractive investment option.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, had reached its nine-month high at $28,000 levels, but it has since been trading in a consolidated manner, hovering above the $27,850 level at the time of writing. The digital asset started correcting its prices once it was unable to break through the crucial resistance level of $28,000 last week.\n\nHowever, it remains stable at the $27,000 levels with an immediate resistance level of $28,000. Despite this, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization is trading higher at around $1.16 trillion.\n\nCurrently, the price of Bitcoin is at $28,357.98, experiencing a slight dip of -0.72% in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, the market capitalization of Bitcoin remains strong, standing at over $548 billion.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, Bitcoin has made an impressive 71.62% change so far this year, indicating a strong growth potential for the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, some experts believe that the worst may be over for BTC and that it could see a significant uptick in price in the coming months.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price prediction April 2023: Will it reach $35,000?\n\nThere is no clear consensus among experts on what Bitcoin\u2019s price will be in April 2023, as opinions vary widely. Some analysts predict that BTC could surge to $35,000 or even higher, while others take a more cautious approach.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is trading at around $28,355, with a 25.46% increase over the past week. The recent collapse of a major bank has put Bitcoin back in the spotlight, reminding investors of its value as a borderless, decentralized, and tamper-proof currency.\n\nGiven the recent market trends and Bitcoin\u2019s upward trajectory, it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect that the cryptocurrency could reach $35,000 by April 2023. This would have a positive impact on the entire crypto market, potentially leading to even more significant gains.\n\nHowever, as always, investors should do their own research and exercise caution when making investment decisions.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ)\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains the most well-known and valuable cryptocurrency, it\u2019s not the only option for investors. RenQ Finance (RENQ) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers a multi-chain platform for trading and investing in cryptocurrencies. RenQ Finance offers several advantages over traditional centralized exchanges, including lower fees, faster transactions, and increased security.\n\nRENQ has shown steady growth since its launch in February 2023, with its price increasing by over 150%. Additionally, RENQ has recently finished its third presale stage earlier than expected raising over $4.3 million from investors.\n\nExperts believe that RenQ Finance\u2019s impressive presale, innovative platform, and use cases will drive increased demand for the cryptocurrency, leading to a surge in its value.\n\nAdditionally, with the growing interest in DeFi and the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies, RenQ Finance is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth of the market.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price prediction for April 2023 is uncertain, with experts having varying opinions on its potential growth. Bitcoin has been experiencing a bullish run since the start of the year, and its current price at around $28,000 has brought hope that it could hit the predicted $35,000 mark if its current momentum continues.\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains an attractive investment option, RenQ Finance (RENQ) is also a promising cryptocurrency with significant potential for growth. Its innovative technology and strong community of supporters make it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the growth of the DeFi and cryptocurrency markets.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Thief who stole US$3.4 billion in Bitcoin deserves prison, US says - The Business Times",
        "content": "FEDERAL prosecutors urged prison time for a Georgia man who stole more than 50,000 Bitcoin valued at US$3.35 billion when authorities seized it in November 2021, which at the time was the second-largest financial seizure in US history.\n\nThe seized Bitcoin is now worth US$1.48 billion, but James Zhong, 32, should do time behind bars for his heist in 2012 from the Silk Road darkweb site, prosecutors told a federal judge on Friday (Mar 31), noting he deserves leniency for helping authorities recover the stolen crypto. Zhong pleaded guilty in November and wants the judge to spare him a prison term.\n\nZhong hid his caper for a decade, and spent US$16 million of the proceeds on real estate investments, luxury hotels, nightclubs and cars like Lamborghinis and a Tesla, prosecutors wrote in a filing in federal court in New York. The Bitcoin he sold for that high life was valued at US$142 million at the time of the seizure, they said.\n\n\u201cPut simply, this conduct warrants imprisonment,\u201d assistant US attorney David Felton wrote in the filing. Zhong is scheduled to be sentenced Apr 14.\n\nWhile taking out some Bitcoin he was storing on Silk Road, the notorious online black market, Zhong double-clicked the withdrawal button by mistake, getting back twice as much as he\u2019d put in. He deposited more coins and quickly withdrew them, double-clicking each time, to parlay the glitch into a windfall of 50,000 Bitcoin, each worth about US$12 at the time, court records show.\n\nWhen federal agents seized 50,491 Bitcoin from Zhong\u2019s lakefront home in Gainesville, Georgia, it had exploded in value. The cryptocurrencies were found stored on devices in a safe under floorboards and on a single-board computer stowed in a Cheetos popcorn tin in a closet. He later surrendered more than 1,000 additional Bitcoin.\n\nSEE ALSO MicroStrategy launches second note sale this month to buy more Bitcoin\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU Monday, 3.30 PM Garage The hottest news on all things startup and tech to kickstart your week. Sign Up We have other newsletters you might enjoy. Take a look.\n\nFederal sentencing guidelines call for Zhong to spend 27 to 33 months in prison, and probation officials recommended 24 months. In a memo filed on Friday, prosecutors said his youth, his autism and his help in recovering the stolen crypto warrant less than two years behind bars.\n\nBut they argued that Zhong concealed his actions for nine years by moving some of the Bitcoin through so-called mixers that make it harder to trace transactions by jumbling tokens together. They also say he was \u201cevasive and untruthful\u201d with an overseas crypto exchange about the source of his holdings.\n\n\u2018Clear message\u2019\n\nZhong needs to go to prison to send a \u201cstrong and clear message to others that cryptocurrency thefts and frauds, no matter the victim, run the risk of incarceration\u201d, the government argued.\n\n\u201cIt has, unfortunately, become too easy for advanced, computer-savvy individuals like Zhong to target and victimise holders of cryptocurrency from behind computer screens, and to hide their crimes through a web of concealment-focused transactions, mixers, and offshore cryptocurrency exchanges,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nLast week, Zhong\u2019s lawyers filed their own sentencing memo arguing he should get probation, arguing that while he had no right to the stolen Bitcoin, neither did Silk Road. They said the marketplace isn\u2019t a victim \u201cin the true sense of the word\u201d under the law, noting that the marketplace\u2019s founder, Ross Ulbricht, contacted Zhong and asked him how he took the cryptocurrency. But he never asked for it back \u2014 and sent more.\n\nZhong is the product of a \u201cdysfunctional family and childhood\u201d, his lawyers said. His divorced parents showed him no love. He was \u201cseverely bullied and victimised by his peers because he was different \u2014 he was extremely shy, overweight, and most significantly, suffered from undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder\u201d, his lawyers said.\n\n\u201cHaving no friends or family he could turn to, Jimmy found solace and friendship in the world of his computer,\u201d the wrote.

        "title": "6 billion USD in Bitcoin held by the US - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "As of 25 March 2023, the US government held 205,515 Bitcoin worth $5.6 billion (USD), or about 1.06% of the circulating supply, according to current statistics.\n\nThe Bitcoin stockpile is the result of three seizures that began in 2020. Glassnode\u2019s on-chain data reveal that on 9 March about 9,860 Bitcoin worth about $269 million were sent to a Coinbase address.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Bitcoin adoption is the growing interest in the digital currency by governments around the world. While some countries have banned Bitcoin altogether, others have taken a more measured approach and are actively exploring ways to integrate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into their financial systems. In the United States, the government\u2019s relationship with Bitcoin is complex, to say the least.\n\nThe complicated relationship between the US government, the dollar (USD) and Bitcoin\n\nThe US government\u2019s Bitcoin holdings are the result of three separate seizures by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2020.\n\nThe first seizure occurred in June 2020, when the DOJ confiscated 69,370 BTC, worth about $1.4 billion at the time, from an unknown hacker who had stolen the cryptocurrency from an unnamed dark web market.\n\nThe second seizure occurred in November 2020, when the DOJ confiscated 29,655 Bitcoin, worth about $650 million at the time, from the dark web marketplace Silk Road.\n\nFinally, in December 2020, the DOJ confiscated 116,490 Bitcoin, worth about $2.3 billion at the time, from an unknown individual allegedly involved in money laundering.\n\nThe US government\u2019s Bitcoin holdings are significant not only for their dollar value, but also for their impact on the Bitcoin market.\n\nWith over 205,000 Bitcoin under its control, the US government is one of the largest holders of Bitcoin in the world.\n\nThis has led to speculation that the government may be manipulating the market by selling its Bitcoin holdings or using its Bitcoin holdings to influence the market in other ways.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the US government has stated that it has no plans to sell its Bitcoin holdings anytime soon. Rather, the government has stated that it intends to keep its holdings in Bitcoin as a long-term investment.\n\nThis is a smart move given the volatility of the Bitcoin market and the potential for significant price increases in the future.\n\nWhat is entailed by the decision of the US to hold Bitcoin\n\nThe decision by the US government to hold its holdings in Bitcoin is also significant in terms of its potential impact on the broader adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nBy maintaining its holdings in Bitcoin, the US government sends a signal to other investors and institutions that Bitcoin is a legitimate asset class and has long-term value.\n\nThis could help increase institutional adoption of Bitcoin and ultimately lead to greater public acceptance of the cryptocurrency.\n\nOf course, there are risks associated with the US government\u2019s Bitcoin holdings. One of the biggest risks is the potential for theft or hacking.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency and, as such, is vulnerable to hacking and other cyber attacks. If the US government were to experience theft or hacking, the consequences for the government and the Bitcoin market in general could be significant.\n\nAnother risk is potential government regulation. Even though the US government has been relatively hands-off when it comes to regulating Bitcoin, there is always the potential for more regulation in the future.\n\nIf the government were to impose onerous regulations on Bitcoin, it could have a negative impact on cryptocurrency adoption.\n\nDespite these risks, the US government\u2019s decision to maintain its holdings in Bitcoin is a positive sign for Bitcoin\u2019s future.\n\nAs more traditional financial institutions and investors begin to consider Bitcoin, the US government\u2019s decision to maintain its holdings in Bitcoin may encourage others to take a closer look at the cryptocurrency and consider it as a potential long-term investment.\n\nIn addition, the US government\u2019s Bitcoin holdings could be used as a tool of diplomacy. Concerns have increased in recent years about the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nBy keeping its Bitcoin holdings and using them as a law enforcement tool, the US government could help combat these illicit activities and promote greater transparency and accountability in the global financial system.\n\nThe idea of maintaining BTC holdings represents a significant development for the financial sector\n\nThe US government\u2019s decision to maintain its holdings in Bitcoin represents a significant development for the cryptocurrency and the financial sector in general.\n\nEven though there are risks associated with government holdings in Bitcoin, the potential benefits are significant.\n\nBy maintaining its holdings in BTC, the US government sends a signal to other investors and institutions that Bitcoin is a legitimate asset class and has long-term value.\n\nThis could help increase the adoption of Bitcoin by institutions and ultimately lead to greater public acceptance of the cryptocurrency.\n\nIt is worth noting that the US government is not alone in holding a significant amount of Bitcoin.\n\nOther countries, including China, Russia and Iran, are also reportedly holding Bitcoin to circumvent economic sanctions and access international markets.\n\nHowever, the US government\u2019s Bitcoin holdings are particularly significant given the country\u2019s status as a global economic superpower and the impact its decisions can have on the entire financial sector.\n\nIn conclusion, the US government\u2019s decision to maintain its holdings in Bitcoin is a positive development for the cryptocurrency and the financial sector in general.\n\nWhile there are risks associated with governments holding Bitcoin, the potential benefits are significant.\n\nBy continuing to hold Bitcoin, the US government sends a signal to other investors and institutions that Bitcoin is a legitimate asset class and has long-term value.\n\nThis could help increase institutional adoption of Bitcoin and ultimately lead to greater mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrency.\n\nAs Bitcoin grows and evolves, US government holdings will undoubtedly play an important role in defining the future of cryptocurrency and its place in the global financial system."

        "title": "Bitcoin to face a 'new ballgame' if it breaks $30k resistance - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) recent momentum appears to have paused below $30,000 after the asset capitalized on trouble in the traditional finance sector, especially the fallout from the banking crisis. Analysts maintain that breaching the $30,000 resistance level will likely be monumental for the maiden cryptocurrency based on historical price movement.\n\nIn particular, crypto analyst Matthew Hyland observed in a tweet on April 2 that $30,000 has acted as Bitcoin\u2019s significant resistance and support level for the last two years. Therefore, the analyst projected that if Bitcoin managed to flip the position, it could potentially mean a \u201cwhole new ballgame.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin has been consolidating below the biggest resistance/support of the last 2+ years. A whole new ballgame if BTC breaks it,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAt the same time, Hyland noted that the NASDAQ and S&P 500 indices had shown impressive strength, closing the week positively. Despite this, he pointed out that there is still a sense of major pessimism and disbelief in the market, with many investors wary of the current economic climate.\n\nSimilarly, a Bitcoin analyst by the Twitter pseudonym Stockmoney Lizards called for patience in the crypto market, noting that the asset faces resistance at $30,000. He also suggested that if the resistance is breached, Bitcoin will likely skyrocket.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin\u2019s momentum stalls\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin\u2019s rally has stalled in the wake of renewed regulatory concerns in the crypto market. The latest incident saw the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) suing Binance for allegedly breaking trading and derivatives rules.\n\nFollowing the scrutiny, Binance pointed out that it does not agree with the characterization of many of the issues alleged in the complaint.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory in 2023 has elevated the asset to emerge as the best-performing asset class. The crypto gained approximately 70%, beating traditional finance products such as gold and the Nasdaq 100 index.\n\nWith a focus on Bitcoin\u2019s next price movement, the odds seem to favor the possibility of hitting $30,000 in the coming weeks. As per a Finbold report, machine learning platform PricePredictions forecasts that Bitcoin can trade at $30,697 on April 30, 2023.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was valued at $28,441 with daily losses of about 0.05%. On the weekly chart, BTC is up over 2%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nDespite Bitcoin hitting a minor barrier on the daily chart, the asset\u2019s one-day technical analysis retrieved from TradingView is dominated by bullishness. A summary of the gauges recommends \u201cbuy\u201d at 13, while moving averages are for the \u201cstrong buy\u201d sentiment with a score of 13. For oscillators, they recommend selling gauging at 2.\n\nBitcoin one-day technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bullish sentiments are also backed by activity around Bitcoin\u2019s options contracts. Finbold reported on March 31 that investors were flocking to trade in Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) following a spike of about 430% in the opened interest year-over-year basis.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
