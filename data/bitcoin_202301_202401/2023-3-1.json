        "content": "More than 50 bitcoin ATMs were confiscated across Lorain and Cuyahoga counties.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nCLEVELAND \u2014 Three people and one business are being charged after allegedly owning and operating cryptocurrency kiosks illegally across Northeast Ohio.\n\nCuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O'Malley announced details of the operation during a Thursday press conference, saying two arrests happened in Chicago and one in Miami.\n\nThose arrested include the owner and founder of S&P Solutions, 45-year-old Sonny Meraban, 75-year-old Reza Meraban and 69-year-old William Suriano, an attorney for S&P Solutions.\n\nAuthorities say the company being charged -- S&P Solutions -- was doing business as Bitcoin of America.\n\nThe full press conference can be viewed below:\n\nTHE OPERATION\n\nOn Wednesday, March 1, numerous law enforcement agencies executed 54 search warrants across Cuyahoga and Lorain counties during an operation, which included 28 law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn total, 52 bitcoin machines operating under Bitcoin of America were confiscated across the two counties. 41 of the machines were found in Cuyahoga County and 11 in Lorain County.\n\n\"These ATMs were seized, 52 of them, yesterday from neighborhood gas stations mainly,\" said Andrew Rogalski, Economic Crime Supervisor and Assistant Prosecuting Attorney. \"These ATMs look like any other ATM. Essentially you put cash in and you tell the machine where you want to send cash that\u2019s converted into cryptocurrency that can go anywhere in the world usually by the means of a QR code or bar code that you can scan from your phone. These ATMs are ready-made for scammers. The scammers here, whether it\u2019s romance scams or law enforcement impersonators, will direct the victims, which are often times elderly or otherwise vulnerable, to specifically go to Bitcoin of American ATMs, take money that they\u2019ve withdrawn from their savings accounts or 401Ks, insert it into the Bitcoin machine and send it to a wallet that they\u2019ve been sent over the phone -- which they may think is their own wallet, but it really belongs to some third party that could be anywhere in the world.\"\n\nCHARGES\n\nAll three individuals as well as S and P Solutions are being charged with the exact same crimes, which are listed below:\n\nEngaging in a pattern of corrupt activity\n\nConspiracy\n\nMoney laundering (8 counts)\n\nReceiving stolen property (8 counts)\n\nCTS license requirement violation (33 counts)\n\nTampering with records (5 counts)\n\nPossessing criminal tools\n\nTaxation\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a new industry with cryptocurrency, but we\u2019re not dealing with new laws,\" Rogalski said. \"The same laws and the same legal theories apply to this business as any other businesses. Cryptocurrency is money. If you\u2019re a money transmitter in the state of Ohio, you need to have a license.\u201d\n\nTHE INVESTIGATION\n\nOfficials noted that one of the biggest problems was that Bitcoin of America was taking approximately 20 percent of the money deposited in each transaction at the bitcoin ATMs.\n\n\u201cOne of the main issues was certainly the machines not being licensed in the state of Ohio, and these individuals taking 20 percent of every transaction that occurred in the machine,\" said O'Malley. \"But these machines were also used to scam elderly people in Northeast Ohio, including eight victims who were led to these machines through fraudulent means to transfer funds.\u201d\n\nRogalski gave an example of an elderly gentleman being scammed in Northeast Ohio.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one instance where an elderly gentleman, within one hour, did three transactions at the same Bitcoin of America machine all in excess of $2,500 all to the same third-party wallet. That $11,250 was gone to him in a matter of seconds. So Bitcoin of America does little to prevent these transactions and then even less to help once the victim realizes that they are a victim of crime.\u201d\n\nAccording to Blaine Forschen, the United States Secret Service Special Agent in Charge, authorities began receiving reports from a number of elderly fraud victims being scammed by ATMs operated and owned by Bitcoin of America in September 2021, prompting an investigation. In October 2022, the task force and investigative unit presented the case to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office.\n\nOfficials believe that since 2018, Bitcoin of America has been evading numerous regulatory safeguards and financial compliance requirements in Ohio by \"misrepresenting the company\u2019s role in transferring funds through cryptocurrency.\u201d"

        "content": "CLEVELAND \u2014 The Cuyahoga County Prosecutor\u2019s office and the Secret Service Field Office in Cleveland unsealed an indictment in a major cryptocurrency scam on Thursday.\n\nThree individuals and one business are indicted on a charge of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity among several other charges for operating cryptocurrency kiosks in Northeast Ohio. In total, 30 law enforcement offices were involved with the investigation.\n\nA Cuyahoga County grand jury returned an indictment, charging S and P Solutions, which operates as Bitcoin of America, the founder Sonny Meraban, 45, his father and manager of the company Sonny Meraban, 75, and their attorney William Suriano, 69.\n\nThey are all charged with one count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, one count of conspiracy, eight counts of money laundering, eight counts of receiving stolen property, 33 counts of license requirement violation, five counts of tampering with records, one count of possessing criminal tools and one count of taxation.\n\nWednesday, police agencies seized 52 Bitcoin of America ATMS in mostly neighborhood gas stations throughout Lorain and Cuyahoga counties.\n\nPolice arrested Sonny Meraban at his home in Miami and the two other men near the Chicago area.\n\nIn 2021, Bitcoin of America\u2019s profits from cash deposits in Ohio was more than 3.5 million, according to investigators. BOA operates over 2,600 crypto ATMs across 35 states and is the 4th largest cryptocurrency ATM in the nation.\n\nBlaine Forschen, the United States Secret Service special agent in charge, said shortly after Bitcoin of America\u2019s ATMs began popping up in Ohio, complaints came in.\n\n\u201cThe investigation revealed, since 2018, Bitcoin of America has evaded numerous regulatory safe guards and financial compliance requirements in Ohio by misrepresenting the company\u2019s role in transferring funds by cryptocurrency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the pathway for money to go from the victims to the scammers, unregulated and unmonitored.\u201d\n\nInvestigators revealed the first issue is that the ATMs are not properly licensed in Ohio.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with a new industry of cryptocurrency but we are not dealing with new laws,\u201d said Andrew Rogalski, the economic crime supervisor at the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. \u201cCryptocurrency is money. if you\u2019re a money transmitter in the State of Ohio, you need to have a license. Bitcoin of America does not have a license.\u201d\n\nForschen added the company misrepresented its money transfer capabilities to avoid Ohio regulators and because of the lack of regulations, BOA became attractive to scammers.\n\n\u201cBecause of their lack of money-laundering safeguards, criminals around the world have utilized the company to receive victim payments and launder elicit funds to criminals, both in the U.S. and across the world. Scammers, robocallers, international organized crime groups have capitalized on the company\u2019s lack of compliance and licensing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added victims, unknowingly, sent money to organized crime groups in Russia and other foreign countries.\n\nInvestigators stated that Bitcoin of America takes 20% of every transaction without revealing it to users beforehand.\n\n\u201cThe money that goes into the Bitcoin of America machine is deposited into the company\u2019s out-burning account, whether it\u2019s a legitimate transaction or an illegitimate transaction, Bitcoin of America retains the 20% as profit,\u201d said Rogalski.\n\nHe added even when the company had users call and report their money gone, BOA never returned its own 20% profit.\n\nThe indictment shows eight victims in Northeast Ohio were scammed out of tens of thousands.\n\nBut Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O\u2019Malley said he\u2019s confident there are many more victims and encourages anyone who believes they have been scammed to contact your local police department and file a report on the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s website.\n\nWatch live and local news any time:\n\nNews 5 at 11\n\nDownload the News 5 Cleveland app now for more stories from us, plus alerts on major news, the latest weather forecast, traffic information and much more.

        "title": "Amid value drops and increased regulation, what\u2019s the future of cryptocurrency? - PBS NewsHour",
        "content": "In the span of a few years, cryptocurrencies have grown from digital novelties to trillion-dollar technologies with the potential to disrupt the global financial system. Bitcoin and hundreds of other cryptocurrencies are increasingly held as investments and used as currencies to buy a swath of goods and services, such as software, digital real estate, and illegal drugs.\n\nTo their proponents, cryptocurrencies are a democratizing force, wresting the power of money creation and control from central banks and Wall Street. Critics, however, say that a lack of regulation for cryptocurrencies empowers criminal groups, terrorist organizations, and rogue states, while the assets themselves stoke inequality, suffer from drastic market volatility, and consume vast amounts of electricity.\n\nRegulations vary considerably around the world, with some governments embracing cryptocurrencies and others banning or limiting their use. As of February 2023, 114 countries, including the United States, are considering introducing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to compete with the cryptocurrency boom.\n\nWhat are cryptocurrencies?\n\nSo called for their use of cryptography principles to mint virtual coins, cryptocurrencies are typically exchanged on decentralized computer networks between people with virtual wallets. These transactions are recorded publicly on distributed, tamper-proof ledgers known as blockchains. This open-source framework prevents coins from being duplicated and eliminates the need for a central authority such as a bank to validate transactions.\n\nBitcoin, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous software engineer Satoshi Nakamoto, is by far the most prominent cryptocurrency, and its market capitalization has peaked at over $1 trillion. Numerous others, including Ethereum, the second-most popular, have proliferated in recent years.\n\nCryptocurrency users send funds between digital wallet addresses. These transactions are then recorded into a sequence of numbers known as a \u201cblock\u201d and confirmed across the network. Blockchains do not record real names or physical addresses, only the transfers between digital wallets, and thus confer a degree of anonymity on users. Some cryptocurrencies, such as Monero, claim to provide additional privacy. However, if the identity of a wallet owner becomes known, their transactions can be traced.\n\nWATCH: After $2 trillion crypto crash, what happens next?\n\nBitcoin \u201cminers\u201d earn coins by organizing these blocks, thereby validating transactions on the network; the process requires a system known as \u201cproof of work,\u201d based on using computers to solve math problems. Many cryptocurrencies use this method, but Ethereum and some others instead use a validation mechanism known as \u201cproof of stake.\u201d\n\nIn Bitcoin\u2019s case, a transaction block is added to the chain every ten minutes, at which point new Bitcoin is awarded. (The reward decreases steadily over time.) The total supply of Bitcoin is capped at twenty-one million coins, but not all cryptocurrencies have such a constraint.\n\nThe prices of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies vary based on global supply and demand. However, the values of some cryptocurrencies are fixed because they are backed by other assets, thus earning them the name \u201cstablecoins.\u201d While these coins tend to claim a peg to a traditional currency, such as $1 per coin, many such currencies were knocked from their pegs during a spate of volatility in 2022.\n\nWhy are they popular?\n\nOnce dismissed as a fringe interest of tech evangelists, cryptocurrencies\u2014particularly Bitcoin\u2014have skyrocketed to mainstream popularity and trillion dollar valuations. In November 2021, the price of Bitcoin surged to more than $60,000 for the first time. (By February 2023, it had fallen to $23,000.) As of mid 2022, an estimated 20 percent of U.S. adults polled by NBC News had invested in, traded, or used cryptocurrency.\n\nDifferent currencies have different appeals, but the popularity of cryptocurrencies largely stems from their decentralized nature: They can be transferred relatively quickly and anonymously, even across borders, without the need for a bank that could block the transaction or charge a fee. Dissidents in authoritarian countries have raised funds in Bitcoin to circumvent state controls, including to avoid U.S. sanctions on Russia.\n\nSome experts say that digital assets are primarily tools for investment. People buy cryptocurrencies \u201cbecause of a speculative belief that these tokens are going to go up in the future, because a new future is being built on the blockchain,\u201d says CFR Senior Fellow Sebastian Mallaby. \u201cIt\u2019s a very risky bet, as the last 12 months have shown.\u201d\n\nANAL YSIS: Crypto companies\u2019 ties to sports raise ethical questions\n\nThe price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fluctuates wildly, and some experts say this limits their usefulness as a means of transaction. (Most buyers and sellers don\u2019t want to accept payment in something whose value can change dramatically from day to day.) Nevertheless, some businesses accept Bitcoin. Many investors see Bitcoin as a speculative asset to hold over time, rather than make payments with, and it often draws comparisons to gold. Some see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation because the supply is permanently fixed unlike those of fiat currencies, which central banks can expand indefinitely.\n\nHowever, after Bitcoin plummeted amid stock market volatility in 2022, many experts questioned this argument. The valuation of other cryptocurrencies can be harder to explain, though many are associated with a larger project within the digital asset industry. Some cryptocurrencies, such as Dogecoin, were created as jokes, but have retained value and garnered investment from high profile investors.\n\nIn countries with historically weak currencies, including several Latin American and African countries, Bitcoin has become popular with populist leaders. In 2021, El Salvador made waves by becoming the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender (residents can pay taxes and settle debts with it), though the move has sparked protests. Some politicians in other parts of the region have expressed support for the idea.\n\nStablecoins, meanwhile, have the potential to rival fiat currencies as the dominant form of payments, experts say. Their value is relatively stable, and they can be sent instantly without the transaction fees associated with credit cards or international remittance services such as Western Union.\n\nIn addition, because stablecoins can be used by anyone with a smartphone, they represent an opportunity to bring millions of people who lack traditional bank accounts into the financial system. However, they have drawn increased scrutiny from regulators, especially after several stablecoins sunk below their $1 pegs during 2022\u2019s market volatility.\n\nWhat is \u201cDeFi\u201d?\n\nCryptocurrencies and blockchains have given rise to a new constellation of \u201cdecentralized finance\u201d or DeFi businesses and projects. Essentially the cryptocurrency version of Wall Street, DeFi aims to offer people access to financial services\u2014borrowing, lending, and trading\u2014without the need for legacy institutions such as banks and brokerages, which often take large commissions and other fees.\n\nInstead, \u201csmart contracts\u201d automatically execute transactions when certain conditions are met. DeFi is surging in popularity, with investors pouring tens of billions of dollars into the sector.\n\nMost DeFi apps are built on the Ethereum blockchain. Because of its usefulness in tracking transactions, blockchain technology has a range of potential applications beyond cryptocurrency, experts say, such as facilitating real estate deals and international trade.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine a new kind of financial system being constructed out of blockchain-based tokens that have advantages over the old, centralized kinds of money. You trust the code, and you trust the blockchain and the decentralized ledger, and it\u2019s a new way of organizing finance,\u201d says CFR\u2019s Mallaby.\n\nWhat challenges has this created?\n\nCryptocurrencies have also given rise to a new set of challenges for governments to contend with, including concerns over criminal activity, environmental harms, and consumer protection.\n\nIllicit activities\n\nIn recent years, cybercriminals have increasingly carried out ransomware attacks, by which they infiltrate and shut down computer networks and then demand payment to restore them, often in cryptocurrency. Drug cartels and money launderers are also \u201cincreasingly incorporating virtual currency\u201d into their activities, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency\u2019s (DEA) most recent annual assessment.\n\nU.S. and European authorities have shut down a number of so-called darknet markets\u2014websites where anonymous individuals can use cryptocurrency to buy and sell illegal goods and services, primarily narcotics. Critics say these enforcement efforts have fallen short, exemplified by the theft of over $1 billion in cryptocurrency by a North Korean hacking group in 2022.\n\nTerrorism and sanctions evasion\n\nThe primacy of the U.S. dollar has provided the United States unrivaled power to impose crippling economic sanctions. However, states including Iran, North Korea, and Russia are increasingly using cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions. Meanwhile, terrorist groups such as the self-proclaimed Islamic State, al-Qaeda, and the military wing of the Palestinian organization Hamas also traffic in cryptocurrency.\n\nEnvironmental harms\n\nBitcoin mining is an enormously energy-intensive process: the network now consumes more electricity than many countries. This has sparked fears about the cryptocurrency\u2019s contribution to climate change. Cryptocurrency proponents say this problem can be solved using renewable energy; El Salvador\u2019s president has pledged to use volcanic energy to mine Bitcoin, for example. Environmental concerns reportedly prompted Ethereum\u2019s move to a proof of stake model, which uses less energy.\n\nVolatility and lack of regulation\n\nThe rapid rise of cryptocurrencies and DeFi enterprises means that billions of dollars in transactions are now taking place in a relatively unregulated sector, raising concerns about fraud, tax evasion, and cybersecurity, as well as broader financial stability. If cryptocurrencies become a dominant form of global payments, they could limit the ability of central banks, particularly those in smaller countries, to set monetary policy through control of the money supply.\n\nAfter high levels of volatility diminished the value of several prominent cryptocurrencies in 2022, a handful of crypto firms were unable to pay back their lenders, which were primarily other crypto firms. Many borrowers and lenders declared bankruptcy, including FTX, at the time the world\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange. The collapse of FTX and other firms resulted in tens of billions of dollars in losses to investors, though traditional financial firms were relatively unscathed.\n\nWhat are governments doing about this?\n\nMany governments have taken a hands-off approach to crypto, but its rapid ascent and evolution, coupled with the rise of DeFi, has forced regulators to begin crafting rules for the emerging sector. Regulations vary widely around the world, with some governments embracing cryptocurrencies and others banning them outright. The challenge for regulators, experts say, is to develop rules that limit traditional financial risks without stifling innovation.\n\nIn the United States, policymakers have indicated they are slowly moving to regulate cryptocurrencies and the emerging DeFi sector. However, cryptocurrencies do not fit neatly into the existing regulatory framework, creating ambiguity that lawmakers will likely have to resolve. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler has called the cryptocurrency sector a \u201cWild West,\u201d and urged Congress to give the SEC greater powers.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have both called for stronger regulations of stablecoins. But regulators have thus far been reluctant to extend crypto investors the same protections that exist in more traditional finance, such as deposit insurance. \u201cIf you buy crypto-assets and the price goes to zero at some point, please don\u2019t be surprised and don\u2019t expect taxpayers to socialize your losses,\u201d the Federal Reserve Board of Governors\u2019 Christopher J. Waller said in 2023.\n\nWATCH: The effects of FTX\u2019s collapse on the cryptocurrency industry\n\nTo limit illicit activities, authorities have targeted the exchanges that allow users to convert cryptocurrencies to U.S. dollars and other national currencies. Under pressure from regulators, major exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, and Gemini adhere to \u201cknow your customer\u201d and other anti\u2013money laundering requirements. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies, meanwhile, have learned to leverage the traceability of most cryptocurrencies by using blockchains to analyze and track criminal activity.\n\nFor example, some of the ransom paid to the Colonial Pipeline hackers was later recovered by the FBI. In August 2022, the Treasury Department announced a crackdown on so-called cryptocurrency mixers that criminals can use to anonymize transactions on the blockchain, calling them a \u201cthreat to U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nChina, which accounts for most of the world\u2019s Bitcoin mining, has moved aggressively to crack down on cryptocurrencies. In September 2021, Chinese authorities announced a sweeping ban on all crypto transactions and mining, causing the price of some cryptocurrencies to fall sharply in the immediate aftermath.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Law Library of Congress, eight other countries (Algeria, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, and Tunisia) have banned cryptocurrencies, while dozens more have sought to restrict adoption of digital assets. Still, most governments have so far taken a relatively limited approach.\n\nWhat is a central bank digital currency?\n\nIn an effort to assert sovereignty, many central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, are considering introducing their own digital cash, known as a central bank digital currency (CBDC). For proponents, CBDCs promise the speed and other benefits of cryptocurrency without the associated risks. Dozens of countries\u2014together representing more than 90 percent of the global economy\u2014are exploring CBDCs.\n\nEleven countries have fully launched CBDCs. All are lower-income and ten are in the Caribbean (Nigeria is the 11th). Since piloting a digital yuan in 2019, China is now expected to extend its CBDC pilot program to its population of over one billion by the end of 2023. In the United States, there is reportedly disagreement among Fed officials over the need for a digital dollar.\n\nREAD MORE: Why the U.S. is eyeing a digital dollar\n\nExperts say interest in CBDCs intensified in 2019 when Facebook announced it would create its own digital currency called Libra, potentially offering a new payment option for its more than two billion users. (The company has since scaled back the project, renamed Diem.) China is another motivating factor: A digital yuan could give Beijing even more control over its economy and citizens, and threaten the U.S. dollar\u2019s status as the favored international reserve currency, experts say.\n\nOne way to implement CBDCs would be for citizens to have accounts directly with the central bank. This would give governments powerful new ways of managing the economy\u2014stimulus payments and other benefits could be credited to people directly, for example\u2014and the central bank\u2019s imprimatur would make CBDCs a safe digital asset to hold. But their introduction could also create new problems, experts say, by centralizing an enormous amount of power, data, and risk within a single bank and potentially compromising privacy and cybersecurity.\n\nSome experts say the potential for CBDCs to cut out commercial banks as intermediaries carries risks, because these banks perform a critical economic role by creating and allocating credit (i.e., making loans). If people chose to bank directly with the Fed, that would require the central bank to either facilitate consumer borrowing, which it might not be equipped to do, or find new ways of injecting credit. For these reasons, some experts say private, regulated digital currencies are preferable to CBDCs."

Credit: Ordinals Wallet\n\nThe Xverse Wallet\n\nJust 24 hours before Ordinals Wallet went live, the Bitcoin Web3 wallet Xverse officially launched Bitcoin Ordinals service. \u201cFor the past year, we\u2019ve focused on building the most advanced Bitcoin wallet,\u201d read the company\u2019s announcement on Twitter. \u201cToday, we\u2019ve launched 1st class support for ordinals.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/xverseApp/status/1625804978618081281\n\nThe wallet removes the need for users to run a full Bitcoin node in order to interact meaningfully with the blockchain. Users simply pay a transaction fee (which they can do in the wallet app itself). You\u2019ll also need to own some Bitcoin (BTC) to pay that transaction, which can also be purchased in-app using a fiat on-ramp service.\n\nTo inscribe an Ordinal, users need to upload an image (or text) to the app and then send a transaction to their Ordinals address. The NFT will show up in about half an hour in their Xverse NFT collection. The actual inscribing is carried out by Gamma.io, a Bitcoin NFT marketplace that has reportedly already minted five percent of all Ordinals on the chain. Xverse interacts with Stacks, a so-called layer 1.5 blockchain with its own NFT economy.\n\nHiro Wallet\n\nFinally, Hiro Wallet preceded both Xverse and Ordinals Wallet with its February 14 testnet rollout. \u201cThe fun is only getting started as we roll out expansive support for both Stacks-based NFTs and Ordinal inscriptions, wrote Hiro Wallet CEO Mark Hendrickson during the wallet\u2019s Bitcoin support launch this week.\n\nHiro Wallet functions similarly to Xverse, with Gamma doing the inscribing and the Ordinals being deposited directly into a user\u2019s account under a \u201cCollectibles\u201d section. The company plans to release additional updates over the coming days.\n\nCredit: Hiro Wallet\n\nThe rapid increase in user-friendly ways for Web3 enthusiasts to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain is indicative of the desire the NFT community has for the newly-found NFT ecosystem. We\u2019re watching the real-time development of an entirely new section of Web3. Expect more wallets, marketplaces, and user interfaces made explicitly with Bitcoin Ordinals in mind to appear in the coming weeks and months."

        "content": "Yuga Labs, the company that owns such popular NFT collections as Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks, will launch a new NFT collection on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMost NFTs, and all of Yuga Labs\u2019s previous collections, are minted, stored, traded, and bought on the Ethereum blockchain. Until recently, the Bitcoin blockchain wasn\u2019t used to make NFTs because Bitcoin had little infrastructure to support smart contracts, which essentially function as a digital receipt that assigns and tracks ownership of a digital artwork.\n\nSince 2014, outside developers have been trying to build out this gap and have been moderately successful. But the cost of pushing transactions on Bitcoin, the culture of the Bitcoin community, and the ease of use of creating tokens and nonfungible tokens on blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Tezos has pushed NFTs made on Bitcoin to the side.\n\n[Read an ARTnews refresher on how NFTs work.]\n\nNow, however, Yuga Labs is launching its new collection, TwelveFold, on Bitcoin, which may signal that times are changing, since the company is currently one of the biggest players in the NFT game.\n\nTwelveFold is a generative 300-piece collection. In a blog post, Greg Solano, a cofounder of Yuga Labs, described it as a collection that \u201cexplores the relationship between time, mathematics, and variability.\u201d Each of the 300 pieces is built around a 12 by 12 grid. Each of the 144 points on the grid display a shiny ball of color in differing sizes, almost like a glob of paint.\n\nTwelveFold uses a new method of creating NFTs on Bitcoin. Instead of relying on smart contracts to create tokens and NFTs, a developer named Casey Rodarmor created \u201cOrdinals\u201d or \u201cOrdinal Inscriptions.\u201d These digital assets are \u201cinscribed\u201d on a satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin possible (1/100,000,000th of a Bitcoin). This inscription allows for data to be connected to a satoshi and thus host metadata\u2014the data that describes a digital asset.\n\nThis metadata can describe basic facts like the name of a digital artwork and its transaction history. Because generative art is made using lines of code, in the case of TwelveFold, the metadata inscribed on the satoshi probably includes this code.\n\nThe 300 works from the TwelveFold collection will be sold at auction on a dedicated website later this week, though no specific date has been given. Bids will be made in Bitcoin.\n\nResults from the auction could provide interesting data. In a flagging NFT market, will Ordinals be the next big thing?"

        "content": "Do you want to take control of your BTC? With this easy-to-follow guide, you\u2019ll be able to securely store your cryptocurrency and have peace of mind knowing that you\u2019re the only one with access to your funds.\n\nMost casual cryptocurrency owners are content to keep their Bitcoin and other coins on the exchange where they bought them. Alternatively, they might transfer them to a software wallet, such as MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet, so they can easily buy NFTs, roll the dice on DeFi applications, or purchase products.\n\nBut those who take an extra-cautious approach to security often opt for hardware wallets: external devices that store crypto keys. Hardware wallets typically connect to a computer via USB or Bluetooth but don\u2019t go online, mitigating the risk of internet-based hacks. Since the wallet stays offline, it keeps your keys in \u201ccold storage.\u201d Because private keys never leave the device, hardware wallets are typically more secure than software wallets.\n\nIn addition to security, they provide a layer of control not present with funds held on an exchange. You decide when to send crypto and don\u2019t need to adhere to limits or waiting periods set by a third party.\n\nAlthough each hardware wallet will come with its own step-by-step setup instructions, we\u2019ve included the basics here as you consider your new investment.\n\nStep 1: Choose Your Hardware Wallet\n\nThere are several criteria you\u2019ll want to consider before buying a hardware wallet:\n\nCost : You can spend anywhere from $50 to $1,500 on a hardware wallet, depending on its features (see below) and reputation.\n\nPortability : If you need regular access to your crypto keys, you\u2019ll want a device that\u2019s lightweight and slim.\n\nSecurity : While any hardware wallet should be secure enough for average users, some have added features and stringent testing standards that put security maximalists at ease.\n\nSupported cryptocurrencies : You can send and receive Bitcoin with just about any hardware wallet. The same goes for most major cryptocurrencies \u2014 but not all of them. If there\u2019s a coin you must put in cold storage, ensure it\u2019s supported on the device.\n\nSupported operating systems : While you can use most hardware wallets with Linux, MacOS, and Windows, you\u2019ll want to double-check whether you can connect your hardware wallet to your mobile phone or tablet (e.g., Android or iOS).\n\nSupported platforms : Buying NFTs from OpenSea? You might want to get a Ledger, which easily connects to that marketplace. Enjoy ShapeShift? The KeepKey was built by the same people and integrates directly.\n\nUX : Beginners may want a device known for its ease of use before scaling up to options with advanced features.\n\nTwo major hardware wallet makers, Trezor and Ledger, have been duking it out since the mid-2010s. Each sells higher-end and lower-end models with their own advantages and disadvantages. Lesser-known brands, including KeepKey and SafePal, provide affordable alternatives.\n\nTrezor : Trezor\u2019s most expensive hardware wallet, the Model T, has a touchscreen for ease of use. What it doesn\u2019t have is Bluetooth connectivity or an iOS application.\n\nLedger : The Ledger Live software provides a comforting glimpse into your portfolio. However, you\u2019ll need it because the hardware relies on analog buttons rather than a touchscreen.\n\nKeepKey : This budget option supports fewer currencies than its peers. It sports a big screen, and its desktop software lets you connect to decentralized applications such as Uniswap.\n\nSafePal: SafePal offers mobile and browser-based apps to help manage the hardware, which is relatively inexpensive. While it\u2019s neither super-versatile nor built for beginners, it\u2019s designed to be more secure than its competitors.\n\nFor this article, we\u2019ll assume you\u2019ve bought a Ledger, but these steps should give you a general sense of the setup process:\n\nStep 2: Download Wallet Software\n\nAfter buying your hardware wallet, the typical first step is to download the software for that wallet from the company website. Doing so will enable you to interact with and use the hardware from your computer or mobile phone. The software allows you to see balances and portfolio information easily.\n\nStep 3: Safely Store Your Recovery Phrase\n\nHardware wallets provide some recourse even if you lose them. When you set up a hardware wallet, you will establish a seed phrase, a series of random words that can help you recover your account info if you lose the device. Write it down!\n\nYou can use the seed phrase to recover your private key and access funds if your hardware wallet gets stolen, lost, or damaged. The Ledger Nano S Plus includes three separate booklets, so you can store it in three different (secure) locations if you choose.\n\nTo reduce the chances of human error, we recommend confirming via the device that you\u2019ve written down your seed phrase correctly. It will take three extra minutes, but it could save heartache later.\n\nStep 4: Set Up Accounts on Your Hardware Wallet\n\nOnce your hardware wallet is up and running, you\u2019ll need to establish an account for each currency you will store on it. For Bitcoin, you\u2019ll set up a Bitcoin account, which provides an address for receiving funds. If you plan on storing ETH, you\u2019ll set up an Ethereum account. You can also receive ERC-20 tokens such as MKR and UNI at this address.\n\nThe software will prompt you to follow the instructions on the hardware.\n\nStep 5: Transfer From Your Exchange\n\nIf your funds are on an exchange such as Coinbase, log on to your account. From there, click the send/receive button and copy the address provided in the hardware wallet software.\n\nAfter waiting a few moments, you should see your funds show up on the hardware wallet\u2019s dashboard.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile hardware wallets provide an additional layer of security, they aren\u2019t for everyone. Unlike standard software wallets, they cost money. Moreover, they must be plugged into a computer or phone, so they aren\u2019t ideal for traders with a quick trigger finger; they\u2019re typically better for HODLers, though hardware wallet makers are adding trading features. Finally, they have to be set up, which may be more than green beginners are ready for.\n\nStill, you can buy a hardware wallet for less than a tank of gas. And the market supports enough models that greenhorns and advanced users alike should be able to find a product that suits them."

        "content": "Bitcoin Punks, the Bitcoin-native spin-off of the popular CryptoPunks blue chip non-fungible token (NFT) collection, saw over 1,145 Ether worth of daily trading volume on Feb. 28, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Dune.\n\nBitcoin Punks is the first collection of 10,000 NFTs on Bitcoin, which were uploaded from the original Ethereum-native CryptoPunks collection via the Ordinals protocol. Bitcoin Punks are 10,000 of the first 34,400 Ordinal inscriptions on the network, which could make them more valuable for collectors.\n\nThe sales surge in Bitcoin Punks occurred on the same day that Yuga Labs, the U.S.-based company behind Bored Ape Yacht Club, announced plans to launch its first NFT collection on the Bitcoin network, TwelveFold.\n\nYuga\u2019s announcement came a week after the Bitcoin network exceeded 154,000 inscriptions within a month of the launch of the Ordinals protocol. The network has over 228,000 inscriptions at the time of publication, according to Dune data.\n\n\u201cBTC now has an extra use case other than just being a currency. BTC is now a place where NFTs or \u2018digital artifacts\u2019 can be created and stored on every single node on the Bitcoin network. The added benefit of having a rock-solid use case of NFTs added to BTC will impact miner fees to go up as demand for network resources go up. IE: Sats/kb will go up, unless new ways to reduce the cost go down,\u201d wrote Yohann Calpu, chief marketing officer at NFT data aggregator CryptoSlam, to Forkast.\n\nJonas Betz, a crypto analyst based in Germany, agreed that Ordinals can benefit the Bitcoin network.\n\n\u201cThe usage of Ordinals comes with an increased transaction volume on Bitcoin, which increases the rewards for miners and can therefore help to make the network stronger and more decentralized. Secondly, Ordinals can also increase Bitcoin adoption by appealing to a wider audience that is interested in NFTs and the broader digital art market. This can help increase demand for Bitcoin and potentially drive up its price,\u201d wrote Betz.\n\n\u201cBut there is also a flipside, as Ordinals are dividing the Bitcoin community. Many Bitcoin proponents are not in favor of a divergence from Bitcoin\u2019s original use case as a store of value and a medium of transfer. Ordinals could also consume more Bitcoin block space, making Bitcoin transactions more expensive,\u201d he added.\n\nKasper Vandeloock, chief executive officer of quantitative trading firm Musca Capital, said that Ordinals will be limited in utility.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of Bitcoin believers that are not fans of Ordinals but I think it\u2019s an amazing thing. The more utility it has the better, however, I am afraid that it will not have many use cases. Something interesting about NFTs is the DeFi part of it which is developing, like being able to use NFTs as collateral and getting loans,\u201d wrote Vandeloock, adding that he is \u201cnot expecting it to be a big part of the Bitcoin network.\u201d\n\nTexas-based Bitcoin core developer Jimmy Song said that Ordinals have a \u201cunique\u201d way of storing digital art. \u201cThe unique thing about these is that the entire jpeg or image is stored in the transaction instead of there being a pointer to an image like in other chains.\u201d\n\nCryptoSlam\u2019s Calpu agreed that Ordinals stand out from traditional NFTs.\n\n\u201cThe big deal about Ordinals is that there are no other \u2018coins\u2019 created for NFTs to be generated on BTC, unlike $XCP (Counterparty) and $STX (Stacks) which Bitcoin maximalists called \u201cshitcoins\u201d and were never fully accepted,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cHow it does this is by using the op_return field, and having data \u2018inscribed\u2019 within it (via Taproot upgrade) that allows for a single satoshi (smallest unit of BTC) to be utilized as the data carrying vessel,\u201d Calpu added.\n\nSee related article: At least US$577 million of Blur-linked NFT sales are wash trades, CryptoSlam says"

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether prices slumped in Friday morning trading in Asia, along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies amid reports U.S.-based cryptocurrency bank Silvergate Capital Corp. could be the next corporate victim of the FTX crash. Polkadot led the losses. U.S. equities rose Thursday after a week of fluctuations on conflicting Federal Reserve comments about interest rates and data suggesting inflation is well entrenched in the economy.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin\u2019s price gains this year bring needed relief to cash-strapped crypto mining industry\n\nBitcoin fell 3.22% in the past 24 hours to US$22,827 as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, extending its weekly loss to 4.78%. Ether dropped 3.19% to US$1,602, for a seven-day fall of 3.33%.\n\nBoth tokens fell as much as 5% later in the Asia morning. Despite the slump, both are still up around 40% for the year to date.\n\nPolkadot led the losers among the top cryptocurrencies, sliding 6.00% to US$6.08, and losing 14.63% in the past seven days. The token has been in a downward trend for two weeks, though the Polkadot community remains active, leading the daily development on Github, according to Github tracker ProofofGithub on Thursday.\n\nSilvergate said Thursday in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the company is evaluating \u201cits ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d which sparked a more than 50% plunge in its stock price. A raft of crypto exchanges and platforms have cut ties with the bank.\n\nAs a Federal Reserve member bank, Silvergate positioned itself as a gate between traditional finance and crypto. The bank was hit hard by the FTX collapse and reported a US$1 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2022. It laid off 40% of its staff in January.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.02% in the past 24 hours to US$1.07 trillion. And the total trading volume over the last 24 hours went down 12.30% to US$42.65 billion.\n\nU.S. equities closed higher on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.05%, the S&P 500 moved up 0.76% and the Nasdaq Composite Index edged higher to 0.73%.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic indicated on Thursday that he supports an interest rate increase of 25 basis points in March, alleviating some recent concern the Fed may hike 50 points. This helped stocks move higher, but the market is caught in cross-currents as Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the same day that recent data suggests the inflation fight is far from over.\n\nData from the U.S. Department of Labour on Thursday showed initial jobless claims fell in the week ending Feb. 25, while labor costs rose, indicating inflation hasn\u2019t been tamed by the Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes so far.\n\nThe Fed set U.S. interest rates between 4.5% to 4.75% in February, the highest since October 2007. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 72.3% chance that the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points this month. They also predict a 27.7% chance for a raise of 50 basis points, a decrease from 29.9% on Thursday."

        "content": "This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\n\nCLEVELAND (WJW) \u2013 For scammers, cryptocurrency is now the best way get their money.\n\nAt a news conference Thursday morning, prosecutors in Cleveland said kiosks run by Bitcoin of America served as a middleman that made it easy for victims of scams to lose millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is money and if you\u2019re a money transmitter in Ohio, you need to have a license. Bitcoin of America does not have a license,\u201d Cuyahoga County Assistant Prosecutor Andrew Rogalski said.\n\nThree men were arrested, including Bitcoin of America CEO Sonny Meraban, of Miami, Florida, his father, Reza Mehraban and their attorney, William Soriano, who both live in the Chicago area.\n\nThey\u2019re facing dozens of counts of money laundering, conspiracy and numerous Ohio ATM licensing violations.\n\nMore than 50 Bitcoin of America ATMs were seized across Cuyahoga and Lorain counties.\n\nProsecutors say the machines were frequently, and in some cases exclusively, used as a middleman between scammers and their victims. All the while, prosecutors say Bitcoin of America took 20% off the top of every illegal transaction.\n\n\u201cBecause of Bitcoin of America\u2019s lack of safeguards, criminals around the world have used the company to receive payments and illicit funds to criminals in the U.S. and across the world. Scammers, robocallers and international organized crime groups have capitalized on the company\u2019s lack of compliance and licensing,\u201d Cleveland Secret Service Director Blaine Forshen said.\n\nThe Secret Service also says that the company\u2019s lack of licensing and compliance with the law allowed for funds taken from Northeast Ohio to go to criminal groups in Russia and to neo-Nazi groups.\n\nCounty prosecutors says at least eight victims have been identified here in Northeast Ohio, but they believe there are many more. They urge them to come forward.\n\n\u201cThey should do two things: file a police report with their local police department and two, go to the FTC website, as I mentioned with my comments, to file with their database and make a complaint that will get the ball rolling.\u201d Forshen said.\n\nProsecutors say the company may still have other unlicensed cryptocurrency ATMs in other Ohio counties.\n\nThey say that those machines should not be used because they\u2019re not legal in Ohio.\n\nThe Secret Service say Bitcoin of America has roughly 2,500 ATMs in 31 states."

        "content": "Exploring the Possibility of a Bullish or Bearish Bitcoin Market in the Future\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s price rising to unprecedented levels, it is no wonder that more and more people are asking themselves whether the digital currency is in for a bullish or bearish market in the future. While predicting the future of Bitcoin can be a tricky task, there are some factors that may help us determine what kind of market we could expect from the cryptocurrency.\n\nFirst, it is important to consider the current state of the global economy. If economic conditions remain stable and healthy, then BTC price will likely stay relatively high as investors continue to invest in it. On the other hand, if economic conditions worsen and uncertainty increases, then investors may start selling off their holdings and prices could drop significantly.\n\nThere are government regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. If governments impose strict regulations on them, then this could discourage potential investors from investing in them, and this would lead to lower prices for cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, if governments choose not to regulate them too heavily, then this could encourage people to invest in them which would lead to higher prices for the cryptocurrencies.\n\nOverall, while predicting whether we can expect a bullish or bearish market with regards to Bitcoin is difficult at best, taking these factors into account should help give us an idea as to what kind of market we might be able to see with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the near future.\n\nWhat are some key drivers of the price movements of Bitcoin?\n\nThe price movements of Bitcoin are driven by a variety of factors, including news and events related to the cryptocurrency, as well as market sentiments. News about Bitcoin such as when it is adopted by major companies or governments, typically influences its price. Market sentiments also play an important role in driving Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. When investors become more optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, they tend to buy more of it, which drives up its price. On the other hand, when investors become pessimistic about the prospects of Bitcoin, they tend to sell off their holdings, and this causes its price to drop.\n\nRelated: https://dailybruin.com/2023/03/20/bitcoin-dominance/\n\nInvestigating the impact of global economic conditions on Bitcoin trading\n\nBitcoin trading is a complex and dynamic process that is heavily influenced by global economic conditions. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network, meaning there are no central banks or governments controlling its value or supply. As such, its value can be highly volatile and subject to rapid changes in response to global economic events. For example, when news of an impending recession breaks out, investors may flock to Bitcoin as a safe haven asset due to its decentralized nature and lack of government control. On the other hand, if news of an economic boom emerges, investors may be more likely to invest in traditional assets such as stocks and bonds instead of Bitcoin due to their perceived stability and higher returns.\n\nIs Bitcoin expected to remain volatile in the long-term, or is it likely to stabilize over time?\n\nThe future of Bitcoin is uncertain, and its price may go one way or the other even in the long term. While some experts believe that Bitcoin will eventually stabilize over time, others think it will continue to be highly volatile due to its decentralized nature and lack of regulation. As more people become aware of Bitcoin and start investing in it, the demand for the cryptocurrency could increase significantly, which could lead to further volatility. Also, as governments around the world begin to regulate cryptocurrencies more strictly, this could have an impact on the price movement of Bitcoin. Ultimately, only time will tell whether or not Bitcoin will remain volatile in the long term or if it will eventually stabilize over time."

        "content": "Company mines 576 bitcoin in the year\u2019s shortest month; hits new efficiency milestone of 30.6 watts per terahash\n\nLAS VEGAS, March 02, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CleanSpark, Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSK), America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122, today released its unaudited bitcoin mining and operations update for the month ending February 28, 2023.\n\n\u201cOur background in energy efficiency gives us a clear advantage in the market as we make incremental improvements to our mining fleet,\u201d said Zach Bradford, CEO. \u201cFor example, this month we improved our efficiency by over three percent compared to December 2022, when we last reported these numbers in our quarterly report. That progress, coupled with average wholesale power rates as low as two cents per kilowatt hour, has allowed us to increase our profit margins even as production compressed month-over-month due to February being the shortest month of the year. Months like February are practice-runs for halving\u2014and we intend to continue to test and deploy all hardware and software at our disposal in our bid to be the best prepared miner when halving happens next year.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, construction continues in Washington, where an additional 50 megawatts are set to go online in a few months. We are relying on everything we have learned in this space, since constructing our very first mining campus in College Park, as we build the Washington expansion. Our ability to constantly iterate\u2014whether we are building air-cooled facilities or deploying latest-gen immersion cooling\u2014is built into the CleanSpark way. It\u2019s how we have managed to grow fast and reliably in the few short years since we entered this industry\u2014and how we\u2019ll continue to grow well into our future.\u201d\n\nFebruary Bitcoin Mining Update (unaudited)\n\nBitcoin mined in February: 576\n\nCY2023 bitcoin mined: 1,273\n\nTotal BTC holdings as of February 28: 100\n\nTotal BTC converted for operations and growth in February: 778\n\nCurrently deployed fleet of about 66,900 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a hashrate of 6.6 EH/s\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Company funded growth and operations through the sale of 778 bitcoins in February 2023 at an average of approximately $23K per BTC (compared to $19K in January 2023). Sales of BTC equated to proceeds of approximately $17.9 million. February daily BTC mined averaged about 20.6 and reached a high of 21.5.\n\nAbout CleanSpark\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK) is America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122.

        "content": "Yahoo Finance crypto reporter David Hollerith joins the Live show with updates on Binance and bitcoin.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\n- Investors piling out of Binance Coin, with more than $6 billion of outflows over the past month. David Hollerith here to discuss what is happening here, my man.\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Dave, so two weeks ago, the US-based crypto trust company Paxos, which creates an issues the Binance USD stablecoin, the stablecoin you're talking about, was ordered to stop creating new versions of the token by New York regulators. And since then, we've seen about $6 billion fall from the market cap of this coin. A little more than half of that total has flowed into two larger stablecoins, Tether and Circle's USDC. So prior to the regulatory crackdown, Binance USD was the third largest stablecoin. But this is the beginning of-- excuse me, not the beginning, this is the latest of what's been a series of kerfuffles and financial questions that have been thrown towards Binance in the wake of FTX's collapse.\n\nThere's also been this \"Forbes\" article that came out on Monday that drew attention to the fact that Binance may be moving assets in-- or, excuse me, the assets that support stablecoins linked to this stablecoin, which are also known as B tokens. They've been moving those outside of the exchange's wallets and to other parties, including trading firms, which also include Alameda Research. So there's a lot of questions about that transaction flow and what it could mean for customers' assets.\n\nAnd Binance has rebuked a lot of these charges. Their statements have been mixed. But more or less, they've said that the report has been a misunderstanding of blockchain data.\n\nNow, while it remains to be seen what is correct, the CSO of Binance or shortly after Paxos experienced this crackdown had said that regardless of how the exchange keeps cryptocurrency in wallets, it keeps a separate ledger for corporate transactions, for corporate money and customer money. But it's really not been made clear whether or not that's actually being divided in practice in how they keep the money in wallets. And if what Forbes is alleging is true in backing, I will say, with blockchain data, it would seem that at least for a period in late August, Binance did move funds that were supposed to back one of its-- a few of its stablecoins to trading firms, which would mean the company was lending and not necessarily backing its assets one for one, as they have said they've been doing. But, again, this is all something that we're going to continue to watch as it unfolds.\n\nStory continues\n\n- We certainly will. And, David, while we have you, Bitcoin. Let's talk about the price that we have seen, the rally that we have seen since the start of the year. You're looking at Bitcoin up just over 40% since January 1.\n\nWhat do you make of this massive rally that we've seen? And we're starting a new month today, the first day of March. Enough for that momentum to continue?\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah, January was momentum fueled for cryptocurrencies. And through February, we actually saw the rally fizzle out. Cryptocurrencies in general ended yesterday, the end of February, flat. And while volatility has fizzled, traders are still piling into the crypto options market.\n\nAnd they have concentrated bets, according to the data, from platform Amber Data of Bitcoin hitting $30,000. And that's the highest concentration, although there's a lot of bets that have been placed between $25,000 and $30,000. And $25,000, of course, is the price that traders have been looking for Bitcoin to rally past. It did breach that price point in February briefly. But that's been the point of contention here.\n\nAnd the expiration date for options right now, the highest amount is set for March 31. So unless the price goes higher before then, we could expect a large liquidation. But, that being said, it looks like because there's little resistance in between $25,000 and $30,000, if the price does get a momentum rally this month above $26,000 or something like that, we could very easily see $30,000.\n\n- All right, David Hollerith, always great to have you there. It's certainly been incredible watching the price action as of late when it comes to crypto and Bitcoin more specifically."

        "title": "Tinder Bitcoin Scams and Other Crypto Hustles to Avoid - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Tinder Bitcoin Scams and Other Crypto Hustles to Avoid\n\nWith the Bitcoin price now entering a bull run cycle, Tinder Bitcoin scams and a range of other crypto rip-offs are on the rise - here's what to look out for.\n\nThe pseudonymous and hard-to-trace nature of cryptocurrencies makes them a popular target for cybercriminals. Stealing money out of someone\u2019s bank account and getting away with it is hard. Receiving Bitcoin from someone\u2019s crypto wallet once it has been compromised or social engineered, and getting away with it, is easy.\n\nTinder Bitcoin Scams\n\nTinder Bitcoin scams and other crypto hustles remain prevalent and scammers are using increasingly creative methods to get their hands on your coins.\n\nAn ongoing crypto scam that continues making the rounds can be found on the dating app Tinder. According to a Reddit post, one version of this scam involves Asian women (more likely individuals posing as Asian women) gaining the trust of their victims on Tinder before moving the conversation to Whatsapp or WeChat. Then the conversation turns to investments and \u201can inside tip about a new crypto asset\u201d or the girl\u2019s rich uncle who is a blockchain investor etc. Once the victims transfer funds, their money is gone. Hundreds of Tinder users have shared their experience in this Reddit post and others \u2013 although none say they actually fell for it.\n\nTinder user \u2018John\u2019 shared his Tinder experience with \u201cZhang Yu\u201d with Brave New Coin. Although scams like this are often referred to as \u2018Chinese crypto scams\u2019, the reality is they can be launched from anywhere. \u201cShe claimed to be from Qingdao China,\u201d John says, \u201cbut her number was recognized as being in Bangkok. Her WhatsApp number was supposedly Chinese, but I know that WhatsApp doesn\u2019t work in China. She poses as the daughter of a rich vineyard owner and sends pictures of her flashy lifestyle.\u201d\n\nJohn says the conversation quickly turned to crypto. \u201cShe gave this website \u2013 ghvcoin.com \u2013 and persistently asks to register and start trading. She\u2019s adamant that she earns easy 10K, 20K, 40K, every day from trading GHVcoin.\u201d John says he did his homework. \u201cThe GHV website does not provide any company registration details \u2013 no team behind the project \u2013 no physical address \u2013 I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just built to receive BTC and ETH deposits.\u201d\n\nAn even more sinister version of this scam involves real women targeting crypto holders on Tinder by drugging them and then attempting to drain their crypto accounts. Jameson Lopp, CTO at Casa tweeted that a high net worth Casa client was recently targeted in this way.\n\nYouTube Crypto Scams\n\nOn YouTube unfortunately, seeing is not necessarily believing, as the world\u2019s most popular video-sharing platform remains unable to stop fake ads targeting users with an interest in genuine crypto-related video content (BNC\u2019s own channel is often targeted). What makes these scams more convincing is that they include video of trusted crypto notables like ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and Vitalik Buterin in their scam ads.\n\nTypically the ads will promote some type of Bitcoin or Ethereum \u2018giveaway\u2019 with users being asked to send in their BTC and ETH and receive double that back as some type of exchange \u2018goodwill\u2019 airdrop. Regrettably, because they appear on a trusted platform like YouTube, people do fall for these scams. In one recent example, Blockchair found that the Bitcoin wallet address shown in a \u201c5000 BTC Giveaway\u201d scam made US$5000 in a matter of days.\n\nWarning! CZ is not giving away 5000 BTC\n\nAnother similar scam featuring Bitmex recently pulled in $20,000 in BTC in three weeks. Google asks that users report any scam YouTube ads using this form.\n\nAlso on YouTube in the comments section of legitimate crypto videos are the ever-present helpful traders who share their success stories and links to the trading gurus who showed them how to do it. All fake\n\nThey use an easily spotted technique of one initial poster \u2013 and then 5 \u2013 10 replies, from others, usually thanking them for their kindness or sharing their own story of millions earned with Guru Bill\u2019s help. The posts are made by bots and all the \u2018people\u2019 are fake. Indeed, if Guru Bill does exist he will definitely make more money from you than you will from him.\n\nSIM Swapping\n\nSIM swapping, also known as SIM jacking, refers to hackers activating your mobile phone number on a device they own to gain access to your email accounts to then access your cryptocurrency exchange accounts and online wallets. Unfortunately for crypto investors, it is still way too easy for hackers to bypass mobile carrier operator\u2019s security protocols to gain access to your mobile number and a SIM card they control.\n\nUnfortunately, telco phone support staff are underpaid and overworked and are not well-trained against sophisticated social engineering attacks. All of the information an attacker needs to know to begin a social engineering attack can be purchased on the dark web. Haseeb Awan, CEO of efani \u2013 America\u2019s most secure and private cellphone service, was a recent guest on Brave New Coin\u2019s Crypto Conversation podcast. Listen to the podcast to hear Awan\u2019s advice for crypto holders wanting to mitigate against SIM swap attacks.\n\nDigital asset investor, Michael Terpin, reportedly lost 1,500 BTC in January 2018 after falling victim to SIM swapping. His phone was compromised and the hacker made off with around $24 million worth of cryptocurrency at the time. Even former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was not safe from SIM swapping. He reportedly fell victim to this type of hack in August 2019.\n\nWhile it is difficult to prevent these attacks once someone gets their hands on your mobile phone number \u2013 as the point of failure lies with the mobile carrier \u2013 you can make use of other two-factor authorization methods to better protect your exchange accounts. Your long-term crypto asset holdings should always be kept in cold storage, in which they are safe from SIM swap attacks.\n\nFake X (Twitter) giveaways\n\nYes, fake giveaways on lookalike crypto Twitter accounts remain a thing. Twitter has struggled to effectively tackle this issue but has made some progress. Twitter\u2019s algorithms appear to be much more effective at blocking the majority of crypto scammers, however, some are still succeeding.\n\nOne typical tactic is that scammers will impersonate a high-profile account such as Elon Musk, using verified Twitter accounts. To do this, scammers gain control of another verified account and then change the profile to impersonate Elon Musk. They then place replies under legitimate Musk tweets and direct users to fraudulent scam websites. As the images below show, many of these attempts appear obvious, even amateurish to most Twitter users, but they are designed to fool non-native English speakers, which they often do.\n\nCrypto Mining Malware & Ransomware\n\nUnauthorized web-based cryptocurrency mining, commonly referred to as cryptojacking, boomed in late 2017 after the launch of the first web-based (and now defunct) Monero miner, CoinHive. Crypto mining malware infects a website and uses its computing power to secretly mine Monero.\n\nThe crypto mining malware boom may be over but cybercriminals are still utilizing low-risk, revenue-generating malware, according to Webroot\u2019s Nastiest Malware 2020 report.\n\nWebroot has previously identified two nasty crypto mining malware variants as HiddenBee and Retadup. Hidden Bee uses images and video files to infiltrate computers and use their CPU power to mine cryptocurrency. Retadup was a malicious worm that infiltrated over 850,000 machines with crypto mining software.\n\nWhile cryptojacking is relatively easy to spot on a computer (as the PC will slow down and heat up), it is not so easy to spot on mobile phones. If your phone is overheating, or your battery is emptying faster than usual, you may have been hit with crypto-mining malware.\n\nRansomware attacks are continuing to grow in frequency and ransom size. Attackers in this instance will almost always ask for payment in crypto. A high profile attack in the United States targeted hospitals \u2013 hampering their efforts to care for patients during the Covid-19 pandemic by threatening to shut down the computer systems that operate a range of medical apparatus. The destructive payload delivered by a \u2018TrickBot\u2019 infection is wide-ranging, described by US cyber security experts as \u201ca full suite of tools to conduct a myriad of illegal cyber activities.\u201d These activities include crypto mining, credential harvesting, mail exfiltration, point-of-sale data exfiltration, and the deployment of Ryuk and Conti ransomware.\n\nFINCEN has released guidance warning that ransomware victims themselves may be breaking the law if they pay the ransom. This US Cyber Security alert has full technical details of the latest attack by Conti, TrickBot, and BazarLoader along with recommended prevention and mitigation tactics.\n\nWith ransomware attacks growing in scope and severity, the Biden administration is considering a range of options to stem the growing threat reports Politico. Cloud mining is another very common crypto scam. In fact, we wrote a dedicated feature on how to spot these scams, but really the easiest approach is to consider ALL cloud mining to be a scam until you have reputable evidence they\u2019re not.\n\nCorporate identity scams\n\nCorporate identity scams have been around for years but they are easier than ever to pull off when business is conducted via email or some other platform, and convincing looking copycat websites are easy to build. One corporate identity scam doing the rounds in the crypto space at the moment is an advertising offer purportedly coming from CoinMarketCap and advertising aggregator Coinzilla. The scam promises advertisers will receive a huge bonus campaign for booking advertising with CoinMarketCap, stating \u201cLaunch a campaign with a budget of 500-50000 USD and receive boost traffic worth the same amount to your Coinzilla account for spending!\u201d\n\nCoinzilla has advised that the promo is scam \u2013 and warns that the fake offer may not be the actual point of the scam, but instead the attack is designed to get users to take an action that may infect their computers. \u201cDo not respond to these emails and do not provide the sender with any personal or financial information. Avoid clicking on links included in the email or on attachments, as doing so may result in malware or a virus being loaded on your computer.\u201d\n\nBe careful out there.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nHow to spot a crypto pump and dump scheme\n\nWhy has Satoshi Nakamoto remained anonymous?"

        "title": "Bitcoin leverage ramps up as BTC's margin long-to-shorts ratio hits a record $2.5B high - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Crypto traders' urge to create leverage positions with Bitcoin (BTC) appears irresistible to many people, but it's impossible to know if these traders are extreme risk-takers or savvy market-makers hedging their positions. The need to maintain hedges holds even if traders rely on leverage merely to reduce their counterparty exposure by maintaining a collateral deposit and the bulk of their position on cold wallets.\n\nNot all leverage is reckless\n\nRegardless of the reason for traders' use of leverage, currently there is a highly unusual imbalance in margin lending markets that favors BTC longs betting on a price increase. Despite this, so far, the movement has been restricted on margin markets because the BTC futures markets remained relatively calm throughout 2023.\n\nMargin markets operate differently from futures contracts in two main areas. Those are not derivatives contracts, meaning the trade happens on the same order book as regular spot trading and, unlike futures contracts, the balance between margin longs and shorts is not always matched.\n\nFor instance, after buying 20 Bitcoin using margin, one can literally withdraw the coins from the exchange. Of course, there must be some form of collateral, or a margin deposit, for the trade, and this is usually based on stablecoins. If the borrower fails to return the position, the exchange will automatically liquidate the margin to repay the lender.\n\nThe borrower must also pay an interest rate for the BTC bought with margin. The operational procedures will vary between marketplaces held by centralized and decentralized exchanges, but usually the lender gets to decide the rate and duration of the offers.\n\nMargin traders can either long or short\n\nMargin trading allows investors to leverage their positions by borrowing stablecoins and using the proceeds to buy more cryptocurrency. When these traders borrow Bitcoin, they use the coins as collateral for short positions, which means they are betting on a price decrease.\n\nThat is why analysts monitor the total lending amounts of Bitcoin and stablecoins to understand whether investors are leaning bullish or bearish. Interestingly, Bitfinex margin traders entered their highest leverage long/short ratio on Feb. 26.\n\nBitfinex margin Bitcoin longs/shorts ratio. Source: TradingView\n\nHistorically, Bitfinex margin traders are known for creating margin positions of 10,000 BTC or higher quickly, indicating the participation of whales and large arbitrage desks.\n\nAs the above chart indicates, on Feb. 26, the BTC/USD long (bulls) margin demand outpaced shorts (bears) by 133 times, at 105,300 BTC. Before 2023, the last time this indicator reached an all-time high favoring longs was Sept. 12, 2022. Unfortunately, for bulls, the result benefited bears as Bitcoin nosedived 19% over the following six days.\n\nTraders should cross-reference the data with other exchanges to ensure the anomaly is market-wide, especially since each marketplace holds different risks, norms, liquidity and availability.\n\nOKX, for instance, provides a margin lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. At OKX, traders can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of a cryptocurrency's price.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders' margin lending ratio increased through February, signaling that professional traders added leveraged long positions even as Bitcoin price failed to break the $25,000 resistance multiple times between Feb. 16 and Feb. 23.\n\nFurthermore, the margin ratio at OKX on Feb. 22 was the highest level seen in over six months. This level is highly unusual and matches the trend seen at Bitfinex where a strong imbalance favored Bitcoin margin longs.\n\nRelated: Can Bitcoin reach $25K again in March 2023? Watch Market Talks live\n\nThe difference in the cost of leverage could explain the imbalance\n\nThe rate for leverage BTC longs at Bitfinex has been almost nonexistent throughout 2023, currently sitting below 0.1% per year. In short, traders should not panic, considering the cost of margin lending remains in a zone that is deemed healthy, and the imbalance is not present in futures contracts markets.\n\nThere may be a plausible explanation for the movement, which did not happen overnight. For instance, a possible culprit is the rising cost of stablecoin lending.\n\nInstead of the minimal rate offered for Bitcoin loans, stablecoin borrowers pay 25% per year on Bitfinex. That cost increased significantly in November 2022 when the leading derivatives exchange FTX and their market-maker, Alameda Research, blew up.\n\nAs long as Bitcoin margin markets remain extremely unbalanced, traders should continue monitoring the data for additional signs of stress. Currently, no red flags are raised, but the size of the Bitfinex BTC/USD longs ($2.5 billion position) should be a reason for concern.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

However, 2023 marked a new low by recording a decline in total crypto ATM installations for two consecutive months.\n\nIn January 2023, the global crypto ATM network shed 289 machines, further dropping by 123 machines in February. While the ongoing decline was initially purely attributed to geopolitical tensions, revenue losses and a prolonged bear market, service providers have been trying out cheaper alternatives for operations.\n\nRecently, crypto ATM provider Bitcoin Depot converted its 7,000 physical machines to BitAccess software.

High-volume transactions will not initially be supported with the integration.\n\nThe new integration was introduced on Feb. 27 as part of a new update for Xapo bank\u2019s apps on the App Store and the Google Play Store.\n\nLightning Network transactions on Xapo via Lightspark\n\nAccording to Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca, Bitcoin\u2019s transaction confirmation can take up to one hour during periods of high usage, which makes BTC unsuitable for small daily payments like groceries. By integrating the Lightning Network, Xapo allows its customers to pay with Bitcoin without having to convert it to the U.S. dollar, he said.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin node connection shuts down: BlueWallet users urged to withdraw funds\n\nBitcoin average confirmation time has seen a huge spike in mid-February amid a massive activity on the Bitcoin network, with the mempool size reaching November 2022 levels. According to data from YCharts, BTC confirmation time hit nearly 600 minutes on Feb. 19.\n\nSource: Ycharts\n\nRocca also noted that Bitcoin payments are especially crucial during times of hyperinflation, economic uncertainty and political turmoil.\n\nFounded in 2013, Xapo operates a private bank as well as a Bitcoin custodian and wallet regulated by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission. The company is known for combining traditional banking with crypto by offering USD and BTC accounts in one place.\n\nXapo claims that, at the peak of its Bitcoin custodianship, the firm held more than 800,000 BTC ($18.7 billion) for family offices, funds and high net-worth individuals. Such an amount of Bitcoin is more than 4% of the entire number of all BTC in circulation."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) bulls laid most of their options at $24,500 and higher for the March 3 options expiry, and given the recent bullishness seen from BTC, who can blame them? On Feb. 21, Bitcoin\u2019s price briefly traded above $25,200, reflecting an 18% gain in eight days. Unfortunately, regulatory pressure on the crypto sector increased, and despite no effective measures being announced, investors are still wary and reactive to remarks from policymakers.\n\nFor instance, on Feb. 23, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler claimed that \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d falls under the agency's jurisdiction. Gensler noted that most crypto projects \u201care securities because there\u2019s a group in the middle and the public is anticipating profits based on that group.\u201d\n\nMarch 1 comments from two U.S. Federal Reserve officials reiterated the necessity for even more aggressive interest rate increases to curb inflation. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari\u2019s and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic\u2019s comments also decreased investors\u2019 expectations of a monetary policy reversal happening in 2023.\n\nThe stricter stance from the macroeconomic and crypto regulatory environment caused investors to rethink their exposure to cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, Bitcoin\u2019s price decline practically extinguished bulls\u2019 expectation for a $24,500 or higher options expiry on March 3, so their bets are unlikely to pay off as the deadline approaches.\n\nBulls were \u201crug pulled\u201d by negative regulatory remarks\n\nThe open interest for the March 3 options expiry is $710 million, but the actual figure will be lower since bulls became overconfident after Bitcoin traded above $25,000 on Feb. 21.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for March 3. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 1.12 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $400 million call (buy) open interest and the $310 million put (sell) options. However, the expected outcome is likely much lower regarding active open interest.\n\nFor example, if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $23,600 at 8:00 am UTC on March 3, only $50 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $24,000 or $25,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nBears have set their trap below $23,000\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on March 3 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $22,000 and $22,500: 700 calls vs. 6,200 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $120 million.\n\n700 calls vs. 6,200 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $120 million. Between $22,500 and $23,000: 1,000 calls vs. 4,800 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $85 million.\n\n1,000 calls vs. 4,800 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $85 million. Between $23,000 and $24,000: 2,100 calls vs. 1,800 puts. The net result is balanced between bulls and bears.\n\n2,100 calls vs. 1,800 puts. The net result is balanced between bulls and bears. Between $24,000 and $25,000: 4,900 calls vs. 400 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $110 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor example, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price, but unfortunately, there's no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin's least volatile month ever? BTC price ends February up 0.03%\n\nCould weak U.S. mortgage applications could benefit BTC bulls?\n\nBitcoin bulls must push the price above $24,000 on March 3 to secure a potential $110 million profit. However, data from an announcement from the Mortgage Bankers Association on March 1 might turn the tide favorably for BTC. The weekly volume of mortgage applications declined by 44% versus the same period in 2022, hitting the lowest level in 28 years.\n\nConsidering the negative pressure from regulators and investors\u2019 eying the next Fed decision on March 22, bears have good odds of pressuring BTC below $23,000 and profiting by $85 million in the March 3 weekly options expiry. Still, there\u2019s hope for Bitcoin bulls depending on how traditional markets react to the bearish mortgage applications data.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s performance in February reveals that investors are optimistic about long-term prospects.\n\nBitcoin is off to a bullish start, but exchange inflows suggest that some more sell pressure may curtail the short-term rally.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] just wound up the shortest month of the year above its end of January, close despite more uncertainty in February. Now the big question for most trading is whether it will sustain the bullish bias or keep give in to the bears.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nBitcoin\u2019s performance in February may offer some insights into the cryptocurrency market\u2019s current condition and March expectations. BTC\u2019s supply in profit was down to 67% by the end of February, after peaking at 72.2% during the same month.\n\nThis decline confirms that there was ample accumulation near recent highs with the expectation that prices will remain. It also confirms that most of the current holders bought in January.\n\nIn contrast, the current level of Bitcoin supply in profit is still above the lowest level in the last four weeks. The supply in profit bottomed out at 63.99% during the month. This means there is still some room for more downside before it reaches the perceived bottom range below 45%. The glass half full view suggests that there is a lot of room for more upside before it the peak of the bull cycle.\n\nAs far as the value of the Bitcoin issued on a daily basis is concerned, the Puell multiple dropped to its lowest monthly level on 25 February. Its value at the lowest point was 0.67, hence indicating relative strength among the BTC holders.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s peak Puell multiple figure was 1.19 in mid-February. This means it was well below the level considered as euphoria, but the lower range was also not in the capitulation range. These findings further add to the evidence suggesting that investors maintained an optimistic sentiment in February.\n\nCan Bitcoin sustain the optimism?\n\nSo far, the market has maintained some degree of optimism, as was the case with most investors holding for long-term gains. However, the FOMC\u2019s next meeting, which will take place later this month, might determine the next major outcome. Press time sentiments expect FED to raise rates slightly. Such a move may trigger some market FUD and send Bitcoin potentially below $20,000 once again.\n\nThe economic dice is yet to roll; hence, the expected FED interest rate hike is not guaranteed to take place. Bitcoin kicked off March with a bit of a rally as it attempts to bounce off the RSI mid-range.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nBitcoin achieved a 2.63% rally in the last 24 hours, but the MFI indicates that it is experiencing outflows. A look at the Bitcoin exchange flows confirmed that exchange inflows were higher than exchange outflows at the time of writing.\n\nThese higher exchange outflows may give way for the bears in the short-run unless a demand shift occurs."

        "content": "Block, the payments firm known for Cash App and its lightweight merchant terminals, has long held Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Now, the company is taking its support for Bitcoin a step further by deploying part of its crypto holdings to support the Lightning network, a so-called layer-2 system that makes Bitcoin payments faster and cheaper.\n\nOn Thursday, Block announced a new business line it\u2019s calling \u201cc=\u201d that will entail the company taking a portion of the over 10,000 Bitcoins it holds in its corporate treasury and storing them on the Lightning network. In doing so, Block will serve as a liquidity provider on the fledgling network, which is constructed of a series of peer-to-peer channels where transactions are conducted apart from the primary Bitcoin blockchain, and then later recorded on the main chain.\n\nI spoke with Nick Slaney, an executive who leads a Lightning-focused unit of the company called TBD, about what impact the new liquidity service will have on Block\u2019s overall business. He said that Block, for now, is deploying only a small part of its overall Bitcoin holdings to the project, but predicted the new service would in time grow into a significant revenue stream for the company. Slaney explained that Block will earn some Satoshis\u2014the smallest unit of a Bitcoin, worth a fraction of a penny\u2014each time someone uses Block for help routing a transaction on Lightning.\n\nSlaney added that Block\u2019s new service will be especially helpful to merchants who accept payments via the Lightning network by helping them cash out quickly. He also noted that, while the Lightning network is still relatively small, it\u2019s growing fast and has gotten a boost from a new social network called Nostr that incorporates Bitcoin payments.\n\nAll of this is an interesting development for Block, whose cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey\u2014also the longtime CEO of Twitter prior to Elon Musk\u2014has long been a Bitcoin booster. But it reflects as well how Bitcoin, whose culture has long been defined by curmudgeonly hoarders (a.k.a. hodlers), has become a lot more innovative in recent years with the help of the Lightning network. This has been refreshing to see, especially as Bitcoin remains by far the most valuable blockchain in all of crypto.\n\nSpeaking of innovation, I will be spending the next two days at ETHDenver, an annual extravaganza where Ethereum devotees unveil new products and engage in colorful antics that often involve dressing up as unicorns and other outlandish creatures. The event can feel at times like the crypto equivalent of Woodstock, but beneath the extravagant displays there is always an exciting current of collective inspiration. I look forward to sharing more details tomorrow.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCoinbase drops Silvergate as a banking partner in favor of rival Signature, citing concerns about the bank\u2019s capitalization.

        "title": "Obligations arguably owed by bitcoin developers to bitcoin owners - Farrer & Co",
        "content": "The English Court of Appeal has recently ruled that the developers who look after bitcoin networks may owe fiduciary duties and duties in tort to the owners of that cryptocurrency. The High Court had earlier decided that no such obligations could ever be owed. It is important to note that in overturning that decision, the Court of Appeal has not finally decided that such obligations are owed. Instead, it has remitted the case back to the High Court for it to be fully argued on the law and the facts. However, this case is important because it looks set to establish the nature of the relationship between the developers and the owners of bitcoin and because it could also have wider impacts in extending the law on fiduciary obligations.\n\nBackground\n\nIn Tulip Trading Limited -v- van der Laan and Others, the Claimant (Tulip) says that its access to a bitcoin wallet that contained (as at April 2021) US$4bn of bitcoin had been disabled as a result of a hacking incident by a third party. As such the bitcoin is at risk of being stolen by the hackers. Tulip claims that its access to that account could be easily restored by the Defendants, who are sixteen bitcoin software developers (the Developers) of the network on which the account sits, so that the bitcoin could be moved to a secure wallet. Fourteen of the Developers dispute that they owe any legal obligations to Tulip to assist it. They also raise factual disputes, pointing out that enabling Tulip\u2019s access to the wallet will not be straightforward. Further they say that if they are required to re-establish that access it will potentially undermine the foundation on which bitcoin has been established (ie that such access is solely determined by who holds the private key to the wallet). The Court of Appeal said these factual disputes were not for determination at this stage and the High Court had fallen into error in taking some of them into account in reaching its decision. Instead, at this preliminary stage of determining whether there is a serious issue to be tried, the court should take the facts as alleged by Tulip to be true and decide whether, based on this, there can be any obligations owed to them by the Developers.\n\nDecision\n\nThe Court of Appeal said that it is arguable that the Developers owe Tulip fiduciary duties to act to protect Tulip\u2019s interests if a court requires the Developers to do so. The Court of Appeal accepted that this would be a significant extension to the law in this area, but also noted that the law on fiduciary relationships could be developed to deal with new situations such as that created by the development of bitcoin.\n\nThe essence of the decision is that the Court of Appeal accepted that there is a realistic argument that the Developers control the bitcoin software and are able to make decisions about the bitcoin which has been placed under their care by the owners of it. These are classic features of a fiduciary relationship which arguably therefore impose fiduciary obligations on the Developers to owners of bitcoin like Tulip. The extent of those obligations includes an obligation on the Developers not to act in their own self-interests when making decisions and exercising the powers that they have, and may also extend to a positive obligation to act as Tulip are requesting by restoring its access to the wallet in which the bitcoin is held.\n\nImplications\n\nThe essence of this decision appears to be that if Tulip is right that bitcoin to the value of US$4bn is at risk because of the activity of hackers then why shouldn\u2019t the law impose an obligation (whether fiduciary or tort based) on someone else to take steps to remove that risk, assuming that those required steps are not unduly onerous?\n\nThis illustrates that if High Court finds that the Developers do owe fiduciary duties to Tulip in the way that is being alleged, this could have far-reaching consequences in establishing obligations in a much wider range of situations, whether the parties intended this or not. For example, what if information is held in an email account of a deceased person which would be of great value to the beneficiaries of that person\u2019s estate? Could a fiduciary or other obligation be placed on the controller of that account to allow access to it so that the information can be obtained?\n\nClearly, we will have to wait to see what the High Court decides when the case is fully argued, but the Court of Appeal has at least opened the door to the imposition of legal obligations on bitcoin developers to bitcoin owners.\n\nThe full judgment of the Court of Appeal can be found here.\n\nIf you require further information about anything covered in this briefing, please contact Jolyon Connell, Ian De Freitas or your usual contact at the firm on +44 (0)20 3375 7000.\n\nThis publication is a general summary of the law. It should not replace legal advice tailored to your specific circumstances.\n\n\u00a9 Farrer & Co LLP, March 2023"

However, the value of Ethereum went up by 0.32 percent to $1635, as compared to its yesterday's lows.\n\nOn the current fluctuations of the market, Mr. Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder and CEO of Unocoin said, \"Cryptocurrencies face a mixed day with Bitcoin and Ethereum under pressure. These two largest cryptocurrencies, have struggled to bounce back from recent declines as growing macroeconomic uncertainty drives investors to safer investments.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe added, \"Technical indicators such as RSI and MACD suggest that the ETH/USD pair could experience another upside move if it manages to break through the $1,665 resistance.\"\n\nAs the market struggled between the ups and downs, the price of Solana decreased by 0.97 percent to $22.32. On the other hand, Litecoin managed to improve its price by 1.95 percent from the previous day's loss. The mixed market could further affect the Cardano's value by 2.27 percent negatively, in contrast to the positive impact on XRP and Polygon values. At this time, Avalanche also fell by 1.41 percent to $17.52, followed by a decline in Cosmos of 1.73 percent.\n\nOn 1 March, the global crypto market cap decreased by 0.06 percent to $1.07 trillion in the past 24 hours. Similarly, the total crypto market volume stood at $45.06 billion, having registered a decrease of 0.47 percent.\n\nGainers and decliners of the day\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the top gainers were Stacks, ImmutableX, Frax Share, and Maker. Contrarily, the top losers were NEM, Conflux, Optimism, and Ethereum POW.\n\nMeme coins register fall\n\nOn Wednesday, the value of meme coins plunged. Shiba Inu recorded a slip of 1.89 percent to $0.000012. The value of Dogecoin fell 0.18 percent to $0.081926.

        "content": "Osmosis made improvements to its protocol, however, its TVL declined.\n\nDespite Osmosis\u2019 decline in TVL and revenue, Cosmos Hub remained unaffected\n\nOn 2 March, Messari revealed Osmosis\u2019 plans to integrate Bitcoin [BTC] into its network for additional security. Osmosis is a major part of the Cosmos [ATOM] ecosystem, and improvements in the Osmosis protocol could possibly be reflected in the Cosmos Hub.\n\n.@osmosiszone is integrating #Bitcoin security! How? +Checkpoints sent to @babylon_chain via IBC\n\n+Single checkpoint from Babylon is then sent to Bitcoin\n\n+Bitcoin timestamps the received checkpoint, which can then be read by participating @Cosmos zones https://t.co/58djE304gA pic.twitter.com/4o3NWlAA7z \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) March 1, 2023\n\nRead Cosmos\u2019 [ATOM] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nIncreasing security\n\nOsmosis\u2019 security would be working through checkpoints on the network. These checkpoints would be sent to Bitcoin through the Babylon chain, which would then be time-stamped by the network. Finally, other Cosmos zones will read these timestamps.\n\nDespite Osmosis\u2019 attempts to improve its ecosystem through security, the TVL of the network continued to decline. Over the last week, the total value locked by the Osmosis protocol declined from $214.19 million to $190.6 million, according to DeFi Llama. The declining TVL of Osmosis impacted the revenue generated by the protocol, which ended up decreasing.\n\nCosmos remains strong, but ATOM gets affected\n\nEven though Osmosis wasn\u2019t able to show growth in terms of revenue collection, the Cosmos Hub protocol\u2019s revenue remained unaffected. According to data provided by Token Terminal, the revenue generated by Cosmos Hub increased by 51.03%.\n\nDespite the struggles of its most prominent DEX, the activity on the Cosmos Hub increased massively. This could be why Cosmos witnessed growth in revenue collection.\n\nEven though the Cosmos Hub protocol showed growth, the same could not be said for its native cryptocurrency, ATOM. Its price fell by 4.93% over the last month. Consequently, ATOM\u2019s volume decreased as well, as it fell from 502.11 million to 119.91 million in the last month, according to Santiment.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ATOM\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nAnother concerning indicator for ATOM was the declining development activity, which suggested that no new upgrades and updates on the network were on their way to Cosmos Hub.\n\nA decline in development activity would make it difficult for ATOM to see growth in the near future, despite its protocol seeing success in various areas."

        "title": "SEC boss: \"All tokens except Bitcoin are securities\" - Trending Topics SEE",
        "content": "Coinbase, Kraken, Paxos, Terraform Labs, Ripple \u2013 and maybe Binance soon too: The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking increasingly tough action against crypto companies. Anyone who reads and follows the lawsuits and the specialist reports closely knows that all of this always comes down to one key question: Are cryptocurrencies just digital commodities (similar to gold) or digital vouchers (e.g. for one dollar like stablecoins), or are they something completely different: securities, i.e. digital shares, shares in companies.\n\nThere has been a dispute over this question for many years. At least since the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple, which involves billions, courts have been dealing with the question of whether XRP and other tokens should actually fall under securities laws. Just as an Apple share is regulated, ETH, BNB, or SOL would also have to be regulated. Yes, you read that correctly. Even Ethereum is considered by the SEC and its powerful boss Gary Gensler as so-called \u201csecurities\u201d.\n\n\u201cAlways a group in the middle\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything other than bitcoin, you can find a website, you can find a group of entrepreneurs, they might set up their legal entities in a tax haven offshore, they might have a foundation, they might lawyer it up to try to arbitrage and make it hard jurisdictionally or so forth,\u201d said Gensler in an interview with New York Magazine. Behind all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin would be people using a variety of complex and legally opaque mechanisms to promote their tokens and attract investors.\n\nSome would use tricks and sell the tokens overseas first. \u201cBut at the core,\u201d Gensler said, \u201cthese tokens are securities because there\u2019s a group in the middle and the public is anticipating profits based on that group.\u201d While Bitcoin is a provably decentralized network (albeit with partially strong mining associations), Gensler also makes the very uncomfortable assumption that ether is also a security. And if ETH is a security, is Vitalik Buterin the CEO of the Ethereum company that issued these securities illegally (because they were not registered)? And then did Binance, Coinbase, Kraken and Co. trade illegal securities and make billions with it?\n\nSEC cracks down on key players\n\nThe SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Terraform Labs and its fugitive founder Do Kwon for issuing LUNA and UST and promoting so-called \u201cwrapped\u201d tokens like wLUNA speaks for itself. In the USA there is the notorious Howey test, which is supposed to clarify in 4 questions/points whether something is security or not. These would be:\n\nAn investment of money: is it a cash investment?\n\nin a common enterprise: Are you investing in a company?\n\nwith expectations of a profit: Is there a profit expectation?\n\nto be derived from the efforts of others: Are third parties responsible for generating the profit?\n\nAccording to the SEC, the matter is clear in the case of wLUNA and UST: both wLUNA and UST are clearly securities for the US authorities because they could be exchanged for LUNA and thus served as proof of security. There was also a lawsuit against Coinbase to clarify whether and which of the nine tokens in question (AMP, RLY, DDX, XYO, RGT, LCX, POWR, DFX, and KROM) are actually securities. Luckily for Coinbase, the case was won with a dismissal of a lawsuit alleging illegal token sales.\n\nBut just days later, Kraken paid the SEC a $30 million fine for allegedly violating securities laws for its staking service. Again Coinbase had to come out and emphasize again. \u201cCoinbase\u2019s staking services are not securities. We will happily defend this in court if necessary,\u201d it said in a tweet. This also shows that there is a major confrontation between the SEC and Coinbase. And that will ultimately clarify the question of whether tokens are securities or not."

        "title": "How To Sell Bitcoin: 7 Simple Ways - GOBankingRates",
        "content": "Phira Phonruewiangphing / iStock.com\n\nSomewhere along your bitcoin investing journey, you\u2019ll need to know how to cash out bitcoin or how to sell bitcoin. Fortunately, there are many different methods for cashing out your bitcoin, making it easy to convert it back to fiat currency. Understanding the different methods for cashing out can help you choose an affordable and convenient option for your financial needs.\n\nHow To Cash Out Your Bitcoin\n\nHere is a look at seven simple ways to cash out your bitcoin.\n\nUse a crypto exchange Sell through a broker Peer-to-peer trades Convert your bitcoin to another crypto Use a crypto debit card Shop at stores that accept bitcoin Use a bitcoin ATM\n\nKeep reading to learn more about each of these options.\n\n1. Sell Your Bitcoin Using a Crypto Exchange\n\nSelling your bitcoin on a crypto exchange is one of the most common options for cashing out, but it can take longer than other methods and have higher transaction fees. A bank transfer from a crypto exchange typically takes between four and six business days, and you might have to pay transaction fees that could range between 0.5% and 2% each. However, it\u2019s easy to set up a crypto exchange account and complete the transaction. Simply set up an account, complete verification processes, deposit or buy bitcoin to keep in your account and then transfer it to your bank when you\u2019re ready.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\n2. Sell Your Bitcoin Through a Broker\n\nWith traditional investing, a broker helps complete financial transactions using your funds. A crypto broker acts similarly, making crypto transactions based on your investment goals. Using a broker may be a good option for beginner investors, and it may be more suitable for those who want to make smaller crypto purchases.\n\n3. Sell Your Bitcoin With a Peer-to-Peer Trade\n\nPeer-to-peer trades may reduce transaction time and fees. However, you must be aware of how to complete peer-to-peer trades safely to avoid scams and fraudulent buyers. The safest option for peer-to-peer trades is to use a reputable peer-to-peer platform like LocalBitcoins. You can sign up and choose an ideal location for your buyer, as well as send trade requests on the platform\u2019s marketplace. Many peer-to-peer platforms will also offer escrow options so that your bitcoin isn\u2019t released until you receive payment.\n\n4. Convert Your Bitcoin to Another Crypto\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get rid of your bitcoin specifically, you could also choose to convert it to another cryptocurrency. This gives you the opportunity to stay in cryptocurrency investing without holding too much bitcoin. However, you would need to transfer it to your bank account in the future to cash out for fiat currency, which could add more time and fees. In addition, you will also need to choose a crypto exchange that allows for more trading pairs and that supports multiple types of cryptocurrencies.\n\n5. Use a Crypto Debit Card\n\nCrypto debit cards are good for investors who don\u2019t want to sell off large amounts of bitcoin. Instead, you can use the crypto debit card to make smaller purchases directly with vendors and stores, similar to regular debit cards. Many crypto debit cards also allow you to earn cash back and other rewards, as well as access ATMs. Some crypto debit cards will also allow you to add funds to your account using multiple types of cryptocurrencies or fiat currency.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\n6. Shop at Stores That Accept Bitcoin\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to transfer funds to your bank account, you can save time by shopping directly with stores that accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a payment method. However, be aware that there may be high transaction fees. In addition, the fluctuating price of cryptocurrency can affect the purchase price and refunds. Therefore, you may choose to only use cryptocurrency for large in-store purchases, rather than small everyday purchases.\n\n7. Use a Bitcoin ATM\n\nBitcoin ATMs connect to platforms like crypto exchanges to facilitate buying and selling transactions. While some bitcoin ATMs will only allow you to buy bitcoin, you can also find some that allow you to sell your bitcoin and immediately receive cash, similar to a traditional ATM. You must have an account already set up with the platform. Then, you can simply enter your wallet address to cash out.\n\nFinal Take\n\nOverall, it\u2019s fairly easy to cash out your bitcoin. You can choose from various methods depending on your investing goals and spending decisions. However, consider factors such as timing, fees and crypto taxes. Choose a method that is convenient and affordable by researching each platform\u2019s transfer times and transaction fees.\n\nFAQ Here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about selling bitcoin. Can you cash out bitcoin to your bank account? Yes, you can cash out bitcoin directly to your bank account by using a crypto exchange. But keep in mind, you might have to pay transaction fees.\n\nIs it expensive to cash out bitcoin? Some methods of cashing out your bitcoin do come with added fees. One method that can reduce your fees is peer-to-peer trades. Just be aware that with this option, there are occasionally scammers posing as fake buyers so you should use a reputable platform.\n\nHere are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about selling bitcoin.\n\nInvesting for Everyone"

        "title": "What is Bitcoin Halving: Effects And Future - ClearTax",
        "content": "If you are a Bitcoin miner, you may have heard of the term called Bitcoin halving. It is a process that occurs after a set number of blocks are mined.\n\nBitcoin halving affects the investors, miners and the whole Bitcoin ecosystem. Let's discuss it in detail.\n\nBitcoin halving\n\nBitcoin halving is an event in which block rewards for mining Bitcoins are cut in half. This happens after the mining of every 210,000 blocks or roughly four years. This way, Bitcoin enforces artificial price inflation to ensure a steady rise in its value. This process will continue until miners completely mine the 21 million Bitcoins on this blockchain.\n\nThe last Bitcoin halving event took place on 11 May 2020. The current reward for mining a Bitcoin block is 6.25 BTC.\n\nBesides miners getting lower block rewards, the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation also reduces. This, in turn, inflates its price as its demand increases due to the lower amount of new supply.\n\nGenerally, a huge crash always follows a price rise, but the value of Bitcoin after the crash is certainly more than the value of this crypto coin before the halving event.\n\nFor example, after the halving of 2016, in 2017-2018, Bitcoin\u2019s value rose to $20,000. Like any rise in the market, it is followed by a crash, bringing down its value to $3,200. It may seem like a heavy crash, but before halving, Bitcoin\u2019s value was at $650, increasing its value.\n\nEffects of Bitcoin halving\n\nBitcoin halving has a chain effect. All individuals related to the currency, namely its miners and investors, are affected.\n\nAs the mining rewards per block halves, the supply of new coins becomes less. As a result, the price of each coin increases. The reward for miners may be less than before, but the increase in the coin's value makes up for it. Also, for miners, Bitcoin halving can lead to the consolidation of their ranks as individual miners.\n\nIf Bitcoin halving does not cause a rise in demand and value, the blockchain will reduce the mining difficulty on the network. This will make it easier for the miners to validate a block. Though block rewards are still low, the number of blocks miners can find will increase, keeping them in profit.\n\nHowever, there is a catch. Reducing block rewards makes mining difficult for individuals and small mining pools. Large corporate companies are mining Bitcoins 24/7, and competing with them can be very costly.\n\nAccording to experts, Bitcoin\u2019s mining capacity is counter-cyclical to its price. As its price increases, the total number of miners diminishes and vice versa. A 51% attack is always probable after a Bitcoin halving as many miners move out of this network.\n\nFor investors, a Bitcoin halving event is always good news. The anticipation of a halving event always increases trading activities on exchanges. Take note that the rate at which the price of Bitcoin will increase after the halving is based on several market factors.\n\nBitcoin halving value over time\n\nUpon its release, Bitcoin had a block reward of 50 Bitcoins. Its first halving occurred in 2013, and the block rewards went down to 25. In 2016, rewards fell to 12.5; after 2020, its current reward is 6.25. The next expected halving should occur in 2024, and its estimated block reward value will be 3.125 Bitcoins.\n\nThe value of Bitcoins has risen after every halving and held a price that was higher than the one before the event. Before the 2012 halving, the value of Bitcoins was around $11. Due to the halving, it rose a hundred times within a year. During the second halving of July 2016, Bitcoin\u2019s value fluctuated from around $500 to $1,000 for a few months and reached a high of $20,000 by the end of December 2017. After the May 2020 halving, Bitcoin had a bull run and climbed from $9,000 to $30,000.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin mining\n\nOne question that always bugs miners is what will happen after all the blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain are mined. Will mining come to an end?\n\nThe simple answer is no. Bitcoin is a blockchain that works on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus. Miners can validate blocks by solving critical mathematical problems and validating transactions. This removes the need for any third party to validate transactions, and miners also gain new coins in the process as rewards.\n\nThis reward is justified as miners must invest a lot of time and money in this process. Plus, there is intense competition from other miners that need to be taken into account. Miners use powerful ASIC computers that go through trillions of hashes per second to find the right hash to validate a block on the network.\n\nThe intense competition also ensures that any particular miner cannot pull off a 51% attack by gaining excessive control on a blockchain.\n\nThus, mining is a very necessary activity on a blockchain that works on the PoW mechanism. After mining all Bitcoin blocks is complete, miners will still be responsible for validating transactions. Furthermore, they will get transaction fees as their rewards. This way, miners can still act as validators of the transactions occurring on the network.\n\nThis system of reward for mining will go on at least till 2140 when the set limit of 21 million BTC is reached.\n\nIf you are currently a Bitcoin miner or thinking of mining this cryptocurrency, then Bitcoin halving will give you numerous opportunities to earn a profit. You can always hold your newly minted coins till the price appreciates and reaches a higher level. Alternatively, you can also stake them on an exchange platform to provide liquidity to other traders."

        "content": "Majority cryptocurrencies recorded losses on Tuesday, March 1. Bitcoin opened with a price dip of around 0.30 percent on national as well as international exchanges. The value of BTC continues to trade at the price point of $23,422 (roughly Rs. 19 lakh), a value mark it has remained stuck to since the last week. In the last 24 hours, the value of BTC dipped by $15 (roughly Rs. 1,235). With the top-most cryptocurrency garnering losses on the regular, it has an evident impact on the overall crypto chart.\n\nAll popular stablecoins including Tether, USD Coin, Ripple, and Binance USD reflected losses on the crypto price tracker by Gadgets 360.\n\nNotably, the legally challenged Binance USD (BUSD) token, that will be delisted from Coinbase starting March 13, did not see any major change in its value despite Coinbase's decision.\n\nAt the time of writing, BUSD was trading at $1 (roughly Rs. 82) with no significant change in the last 24 hours.\n\nLosses struck an array of other popular altcoins like Binance Coin, Cardano, Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot as well.\n\nDogecoin and Shiba Inu, both of the memecoins, also failed to bag any gains.\n\n\u201cMost cryptocurrencies were in the red on Tuesday, following the release of U.S. Consumer Confidence data for February revealed a decline. For BTC, significant movements are not yet on the horizon. Investors and traders might take some time to process the economic data,\u201d Edul Patel, the CEO and co-founder of Mudrex told Gadgets 360.\n\nA small number of cryptocurrencies managed to record profits, but only minor.\n\nEther for instance, instead of following BTC on the loss-making side of the price charts, managed to reel-in gains.\n\nWith a profit of 0.26 percent, the price of ETH touched the mark of $1,635 (roughly Rs. 1.35 lakh). Over the past day, the value of ETH increased by $7 (roughly Rs. 580).\n\nAlong with ETH, Litecoin, Uniswap, Chainlink, Monero, and Elrond saw gains.\n\nFlex, Floki Inu, Circuits of Value, SushiSwap, and Nem retained small profits on the price chart.\n\nOverall, the global crypto market valuation rose by 1.12 percent in the last 24 hours to stand at $1.08 trillion (roughly Rs. 89,26,560 crore), showed the data by CoinMarketCap.\n\nDespite Bitcoin's sluggish market movement in recent days, experts believe, it remains to be a useful commodity.\n\n\u201cThe number of Bitcoins having a lifespan of more than a year has been steadily rising, creating significant market accumulation. Even though its price just fell, its accumulation rate looks to be larger than it was during the previous dismal period of 2017. This indicates that Bitcoin is still a useful commodity for many market players,\u201d the CoinDCX research team told Gadgets 360.\n\nGaana, JioSaavn, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts,\n\nAfter facing headwinds in India last year, Xiaomi is all set to take on the competition in 2023.

        "content": "Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO Courses Offering College Course Website IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Operations Officer Programme Visit IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Executive Officer Programme Visit IIM Kozhikode IIMK Chief Product Officer Programme Visit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAccording to me, the crypto winter is far from being over. We should once again be testing lower prices if not lower bottoms. We have seen some relief because money came into the market in hopes that there will be no further interest rate hikes. Also, the FTX crisis and before that the Luna crisis has now started getting forgotten and in the absence of any more new fraudulent activity coming up, people are feeling confident again,\u201d says, Founder,Crypto prices are determined by three things -- one, which has nothing to do with crypto which is macroeconomics. US interest rates are 19 times higher than they were one year ago so 0.25 to 4.75, this has been the biggest driver of the crash but this has also been the driver of some relief we saw recently. The other two problems are very crypto centric. One is there are a lot of protocols and tokens that came out in the market and could only survive in the bull market. One by one they are crashing and then, of course, the ever persistent scams and frauds that may come up. This is the buzz in the crypto market.It would require me to have astrological ability to answer that with precision. In the absence of that I will give you my guess with a disclaimer that I am not a financial advisor. According to me, the crypto winter is far from being over. We should once again be testing lower prices if not lower bottoms. We have seen some relief because money came into the market in hopes that there will be no further interest rate hikes. Also, the FTX crisis and before that the Luna crisis has now started getting forgotten and in the absence of any more new fraudulent activity coming up, people are feeling confident again.Unlike the stock market which has such a long track record, in crypto we have had only four bull markets so far. So, we do not have too much of a track record. What we have seen is that in all cases, when the bear market ended, it was preceded by much more than one year of sideways movement of prices.In the previous bear market, the sideways movement was around the $10,000 mark. This time it is around the $20,000 mark. So even if we are looking at new players coming in or we are looking at money coming into the market. There are lots of people just waiting to sell at even slightly improved prices. So, prices going up is very unlikely in the near future or substantially up. There are some reasons why it might go down. I am clenching my teeth and even preparing for Q1 25 kind of revival though I suspect it will happen much earlier, maybe in early 24.One very interesting statistic which your viewers may not know is that only Bitcoin and Ethereum are two tokens which have survived more than one bull market and that is very interesting. That means when the bear market comes, the previous heroes do not remain heroes anymore. This time, barring Luna and FTT, that is a FTX token called FTT, we have not seen the demise of any major tokens and that worries me. Some of them might be coming up especially because crypto projects actually use their own tokens as if it is a currency and when the value of these tokens and currencies go down, their ability to buy and perform operations go down. Currently they are only firing people. We have not seen worse action than that. My worry is if some of that happens, prices could go down further.If you are looking at a global level, roughly 1% of the people who participate in all asset markets, real estate, forex, equity, mutual funds, etc, participate in crypto markets. The fact is that sentiment of this 1% is very different from the sentiment of the remaining 99% who have not yet come in. The remaining 99% still remain sceptical. They are not even sure that Bitcoin would not go down to zero for instance, but that is not the sentiment of people within the crypto markets. They are trying to be selective and look for companies that may have some more survival, some are going for the major tokens which is Bitcoin and Ethereum. The sentiment amongst crypto investors is pretty decent. Non-crypto investors are staying away.I always have buy orders at various prices and based on the percentage, not on amounts. I have bought all the way down to 15,700 on Bitcoin and my highest purchase has been around the 21,500 marks which was on the way down, not on the way up, which is very important. At present, I fear that all my buy orders which are much lower than present prices may not get fulfilled.Yesterday, one of the Emirates in the United Arab Emirates called Ras Al Khaimah actually opened a crypto free zone. In the last one week, Hong Kong has announced favourable crypto regulations. What we are finding is that there are several pockets around the world where more and more favourable regulations are happening. Even in the US, in the state of Wyoming, in the last one year, we have seen some very positive regulation.On the India front, while they may not officially agree to it, I always sense that there is a difference of opinion between the Reserve Bank of India and the Finance Ministry. Even in the G20, the Finance Minister continued her repeated mention that she would work with international collaboration while the Reserve Bank of India governor actually talked about the fact that we should consider a ban. Since the next discussion in G20 is only in October, it is fair to say that we have a little break and a respite of at least the next 10 months before this topic of ban comes up again.Let us consider two scenarios; one, eventually the whole world will ban crypto, in which case India will look like a visionary. I think the world is headed in the opposite direction and that is regulation. If that happens, given India's tech talent, given India's English speaking population and young population, I fear we are going to miss the bus.I fear that like we have done in the internet, e-commerce and social media, where we had to play catch up and by the way, we caught up pretty well, even here we are going to be condemned to do that. So I would require some visionary thinking from the central bank and finance ministry, recognize the direction in which the winds are blowing globally and align India to maximize its benefit from that.Regrettably, yes, and scams arise for three reasons; one is people come up with fraudulent activity as they literally are fly-by-night operators. If regulations come in, that should reduce.The second one is technological failures such as the one we saw in Luna. Now in this situation, we are just too early, pretty much like when debit cards came here. Debit cards had all the time. Despite more debit cards today, we are seeing that less. I think that is the industry that we are going up.The third one is that today the people who are in the crypto industry and I am talking of the likes of exchanges as well as other start-ups, are focused fundamentally on customer acquisition and not customer education. As a result, the customers, even the ones who are making profits are actually doing it by ignorance. When the audience is ignorant, there will be people who will prey upon that ignorance.If you look at India versus the rest of the world, we have a distinction. In India, the conservative financial investor is largely staying away from crypto markets. The people who invest in mutual funds, the people who have been investing in the stock market for decades, most of them have not touched crypto. It is the people who are in the 18-32 age group that accounts for 85% of crypto investors. Now, these people are investing despite hearing once every two or three months from the RBI that there should be a ban. So that means these people are the wild risk takers. So if a policy comes in, we bring in a new breed of larger relatively more conservative investors. At that point of time, we should see a reduction in the sort of speculative activity you see and hence a reduction in scams.There are two different categories although it sounded like one. The ones who have made severe losses are not necessarily the ones who have lost all hope. So here is the thing. Pretty much like any asset class, just because you may have lost 50%, 80% does not mean that you will have to hold it because it has to go up. Though it can go up, that does not mean it will not go down first.Second, those who are considering swapping between one token and another, may have a very interesting strategy. Please move to bigger, larger cap, more established tokens. The really bad tokens that some of us may have purchased hoping to become rich overnight have shown that they have no future. To believe that they will come up is a little far-fetched.Finally, please do as much research as possible before you enter into this. This is definitely a high-risk asset class. I think it is a very promising asset class. This is all that I invest in but still lots of research is required."

        "title": "Bitcoin: What it is and How it Works - Kenyan Wallstreet",
        "content": "Bitcoin is the star of the cryptocurrency craze. It has generated a lot of buzz on the internet and many people want to invest in bitcoin because of its profitability. Despite its anonymous nature, bitcoin has a potential to change the way we bank, make transactions, and view money. The world is learning more about cryptocurrencies and bitcoin, and it is expected that bitcoin will be the first common currency to be employed in the entire world in the near future. Engaging with Casumo partners could offer insightful ways into the merging worlds of cryptocurrency and online gaming, showcasing the transformative power of bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nInvesting in bitcoin is quite easy, but most people are nervous to start. It makes sense to only want to invest in something you understand. Trading in bitcoin requires skill and expertise and bitcoin investors can either self trade or do it with the help of a professional broker. In this article we are going to look at what bitcoin is, how it works, how to start investing in bitcoin and the risks associated with investing in bitcoin.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin, normally abbreviated as BTC, is a virtual currency controlled by a decentralised user base and is not controlled by the whims of Central Bank authority or National government. Bitcoin was introduced by one Sakoshi Nakamoto and is the most popular type of cryptocurrency for investment. Other cryptocurrencies available are often known as altcoins. When we say bitcoin is virtual, it means that it has no physical backing and can be sent electronically from one user to the next, anywhere in the world.\n\nBitcoin Mining\n\nThe value of bitcoin is known to fluctuate because of a finite number of coins available as a result of bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining involves \u201cdigging up\u201d of bitcoins and bringing them to light, a little at a time. There are bitcoin protocols that contain bitcoins which have not yet been brought out. Bitcoin protocol stipulates that a maximum of 21,000,000 million bitcoins will exist at one point, in the future.\n\nWhat bitcoin miners do is that they bring these bitcoin up a few at a time. Once the maximum number of bitcoins to be mined is reached, no more coins are mined. When the bitcoin protocol allows for a larger supply, bitcoin mining continues. Mining ensures fairness, stability and security of bitcoins. This is as a result of scarcity and the blockchain technology that bitcoin embraces. Bitcoin miners get paid in transaction fees for creating blocks of validated transactions and including them in blockchain.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Work?\n\nWith a coin, you can buy products or services. However, bitcoin has no tangible attributes, but it operates almost in the same way as normal currency. Bitcoin has a decentralised structure, which means there is no interference from the government or the Central Bank and users are in complete control of their transactions.\n\nA bitcoin miner gets money after creating blocks and incorporating them into the blockchain through transaction fees. Once a bitcoin miner obtains bitcoins, he or she keeps them in a wallet before deciding to sell them to another investor at a price. You can buy either low quality or high quality bitcoins. Bitcoin can also be used as a payment method for the purchase of goods and services and is accepted by some merchants.\n\nHow to Start Investing in Bitcoin\n\nTo invest in bitcoin, you have to first buy them on bitcoin exchange. When you are buying bitcoins, it is good to buy high quality bitcoin, but you can opt for either according to how much you are willing to invest. When buying bitcoins, you have to consider the payment method,the bitcoin platform and where you want your bitcoins to go (wallet). You must also have a bank account, personal identification information and a good internet connection to trade.\n\nOne such exchange, eToro, allows investors to purchase and trade cryptocurrencies quickly and securely. Since it is a popular online trading platform that provides a secure and easy way to buy bitcoin with eToro and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin, etc., quickly and conveniently.\n\nHere are the simplified steps:\n\nJoin a bitcoin exchange. Bitcoin exchanges allow you to make purchases of bitcoins. Although there is no bitcoin company, there are many cryptocurrency exchanges that can help you get started in your bitcoin investment. Some of the most popular exchanges include Coinbase, Binance and Kraken.\n\nGet a bitcoin wallet. Once you have purchased your bitcoins, they have to be stored in a wallet. There are two types of bitcoin wallets: a hot wallet and a cold wallet. Your cryptocurrency exchange provider is responsible for operating your hot wallet, whereas you can operate your own cold wallet. Some of the best bitcoin wallets include Electrum and Mycelium.\n\nHave a bank account. A bank account is a necessary part of bitcoin investment because it allows you to connect your wallet. This makes the sale and purchase of bitcoins easier.\n\nPlace your bitcoin order. Here, you can either buy a whole bitcoin, which is quite costly, or a fraction of a single bitcoin.\n\nCheck on your bitcoin investment. Once you have bought your bitcoins, you have an option of holding them in your wallet until they appreciate in value, make online transactions or trade your coins with other bitcoin investors.\n\nRisks Associated With Bitcoin Investment\n\nBefore you decide to invest in bitcoin, it is necessary to be wary of these risks.\n\nSecurity risk. Bitcoin investment operates on a digital platform. If you do not have a wallet and you forget or misplace you key there is rarely a way to retrieve your coins. Hacking is also a serious risk, since there is no way to retrieve lost or stolen bitcoins.\n\nFraud risk. Hackers gain personal information and use that for transaction fraud, where they make purchases in your name and never refund the bitcoins. This is one of the biggest risks of bitcoin investments.\n\nMarket risk. The price of bitcoin is volatile. Because of this fluctuation, a bitcoin investor faces the risk of losing a lot of money once the bitcoin value goes down.\n\nInsurance risk. Bitcoin is not insured by the government, hence there will be no compensation in case of loss arising from risk.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBitcoin is a viable investment for any average investor. Bitcoin has facilitated faster payment and transactions at significantly low fees in place of traditional banks and Many people believe that bitcoin has an ability to bring about a shift from a cash to a cashless society. However, before you start investing in bitcoins, it is important to understand the fundamentals of this financial market. For starters, make sure you do your research and learn as many important concepts as possible that will help you navigate this type of investment easily. Talk to experts and have someone to help you through this investment process.\n\nRelated:\n\nBrazil Approves Bill Regulating Use of Bitcoin as a Means of Payment\n\nTop Trading Trends of 2022: Oil, Bitcoin and More"

        "content": "Despite its recent consolidation, the flagship digital asset Bitcoin (BTC) has been recording steady increases since the year\u2019s turn, growing over 40% as it rode on the wave of renewed optimism on the cryptocurrency market, and some experts predict the gains will continue in the future, influenced by its halving event.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin could reach $50,000 before the next halving date, which is estimated to occur in the first half of 2024, as well as to top out at an impressive $200,000 in the period after the halving, according to the observations made by the pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Trader Tardigrade on March 2.\n\nSpecifically, as per the chart shared by the crypto expert, the price of Bitcoin is placed in the area at around $50,000 in late 2023, followed by a significant surge toward about $200,000 sometime in early or mid-2025, after which another drop in price is to be expected.\n\nBitcoin price action and predictions. Source: Trader Tardigrade\n\nNotably, Bitcoin halving is a significant event in the crypto world, taking place every four years when the reward for mining new BTC blocks is cut in half. This is done to control the supply of the maiden digital asset, as there can only ever be 21 million BTC in circulation.\n\nHistorically, the halving events have led to an increase in Bitcoin price as the supply becomes more limited. The next halving is set to occur when the digital asset reaches 840,000 blocks, cutting in half the current 6.25 BTC reward for each block mined.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs things stand, the price of Bitcoin currently stands at $23,393, which represents a decline of 1.34% on its daily chart, as well as a loss of 3.12% while still recording an increase of 2.42% over the previous 30 days, as the latest data demonstrates.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAt the same time, crypto analyst Rekt Capital has noted that the time to accumulate BTC at sensibly low levels is slowly running out, as the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) asset by market capitalization isn\u2019t far from the macro downtrend breakout.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
