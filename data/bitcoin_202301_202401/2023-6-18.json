        "title": "Bitcoin miners eye grid flexibility role as regulators scrutinize access - S&P Global",
        "content": "Owners of datacenters and crypto mining operations are claiming that their businesses, far from being a drag on electric systems, can help integrate renewables and balance grids.\n\nNot registered? Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience. Register Now\n\nWith its Renewable Bitcoin Quarq Spread Index, S&P Global Commodity Insights tracks the profitability of mining bitcoin, accounting for the costs of renewable certificates using Platts Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) and Platts Guarantee of Origin (GOs) data.\n\nWhile crypto mining is in the money in key markets, according to the index, during times of low crypto prices and high electricity prices, miners have profited from opting out of consumption from the grid, sometimes earning more than from the mining activities themselves.\n\nSome sector pioneers now point to crypto mining's ability to capture energy from renewables that otherwise would have been curtailed, improving project economics and enabling more development in low-price regions.\n\nPart of that trend is a pivot to smaller-scale behind-the-meter installations, according to the founders of a US mining startup.\n\n\"Our view is not that you should throw up a bunch of generation assets so that you can mine bitcoin,\" said Andrew Webber, founder and CEO of Digital Power Optimization Inc., an energy services startup developing behind-the-meter computing solutions for renewables assets.\n\n\"When you really pencil out that math, it is very hard to make that work,\" Webber said. \"It cannot be the only thing that you are doing with that energy asset.\"\n\nInstead, Webber and business partner Alex Stoewer, COO of DPO, see co-located crypto mining behind the meter as an optimization tool that reduces curtailment or sales into a low power price environment, as well as an enabler for fresh renewables in regions where power is cheap.\n\nDPO has also been able to fund maintenance for an old hydroelectric plant in central Wisconsin after acquiring it and adding computing capacity on-site. Built in 1908, the 6.8-MW Hatfield Hydro Project would have otherwise eventually been decommissioned, Stoewer said.\n\nMining 'seizes valuable resources'\n\nSimilar concepts could work in unlocking more development in regions in Africa that anticipate population growth, the startup founders say. Meanwhile, Europe \"has better uses for [its] power,\" Stoewer said.\n\nIndeed, the energy crisis only reinforced European lawmakers' attention on energy efficiency and potential drains on supply, and regulatory winds have been changing for bitcoin miners as a result.\n\nOne of Europe's more active mining markets is Norway, which offers affordable and clean power due to large hydroelectric and wind reserves. About 250 MW of capacity is estimated to be powering mining in the country, mostly in the northernmost price zones where electricity remains comparatively affordable.\n\n\"We see the energy situation as demanding and that crypto mining is seizing valuable power resources,\" Norway's state secretary, Elisabeth S\u00e6ther of the Labour Party, told S&P Global.\n\nWhile grid operators are obligated to connect new power end-users to the grid -- as well as to award increased capacity to existing end-users -- on a nondiscriminatory basis, queues for grid connection have lengthened in Norway due to rising demand from various sectors, S\u00e6ther said.\n\nTo tackle that, the government laid out an action plan in the spring that proposed introducing new prioritization criteria for grid connections based on the maturity of projects that request grid connections.\n\nThe criteria include financing and plans for load usage, and the minister stressed that the filter will not discriminate against any particular sector.\n\nHowever, in an upcoming revision of the Norwegian Act on Electronic Communications, the government is expected to propose new obligations for all datacenter operators, including crypto miners. The bill is set for a vote in mid-June.\n\nThe government is also revising its national Data Center Strategy, S\u00e6ther said.\n\nNeighbor Sweden, also a hub for mining in Europe, has also indicated it was prioritizing resources for other ventures such as hydrogen-based steel or chemicals production.\n\nBitcoin passes baton to AI\n\nWhile major crypto miners may be relegated to the back of the queue, Sweden remains a hub for flexible datacenters joined with renewables projects, Hungarian startup founder Daniel Jogg said.\n\nHis flexible datacenter startup, Enerhash Technologies, has developed projects across Europe and beyond, advising asset owners like E.ON subsidiary E.ON Hungaria or Sweden's Vattenfall on leveraging flexible datacenters for balancing volatility.\n\nEurope has not experienced negative wholesale power prices for the past few years, but with an increase in solar installed capacity and weaker demand, negative power prices have re-emerged -- a trend datacenter developers say bolsters their business case.\n\nWhen two reactors at the Forsmarks karnkraftverk nuclear plant in Sweden went down in April, Jogg said 200 MW of flexible computing was able to ramp down as a high-frequency demand-response mechanism to balance the grid.\n\nEnerhash also works with oil and gas field owners in the Middle East who are looking for better uses for flared gas by powering data centers, as well as US oil and gas developer Allied Energy Corp.\n\nMeanwhile, datacenter demand is set to triple in the next decade thanks to AI computing power, making datacenters a promising part of the flexibility puzzle, Jogg said.\n\nThe energy companies Jogg works with are rarely interested in mining bitcoin for profit, he said. \"They are solving their problems. They are entering this business because they have the best synergies with datacenters. 95% of the time, they say, 'Do what you want with the bitcoin stuff, we need the datacenter'.\"\n\nStigmatized cryptocurrencies\n\nIntegrated behind-the meter applications do not face the long grid connection queues that standalone miners would, DPO's Webber said.\n\nDozens of utilities and independent power producers in the US are keen to invest in such capabilities, Webber said, but refrain from disclosing early pilots and investments because of the \"stigma\" attached to cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"It is an interesting proposition, but it is just such a risky market,\" said Jonathan Schroth, a research analyst on the datacenter infrastructure and services team for 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nPart of the challenge is the price of devices used to mine bitcoin via proof-of-work technology, which cost between $13,000 and $15,000 per unit, Schroth said. A pivot away from proof-of-work mining is possible, but Schroth said it bears a risk of stranded assets.\n\nInvestors who are uncomfortable with cryptocurrencies are eyeing other segments such as AI computing, which also requires large amounts of electricity, Webber said."

        "title": "BlackRock bitcoin ETF: The wolf enters the henhouse? - Blockworks",
        "content": "Institutional-scale bitcoin investment in America \u2014 the dream of many early digital gold asset backers \u2014 is becoming a distinct possibility.\n\nBut for some, an institutional move into bitcoin is nothing more than a dystopian nightmare, where a noble battle against the corruption of the fiat monetary system ends with the rich, once again, getting richer.\n\nThe application for an ETF by the largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, could not have happened at a stranger time in cryptocurrency\u2019s regulatory history.\n\nJust as the SEC is hunting down Coinbase for allegedly flouting securities laws, BlackRock is requesting the SEC\u2019s approval for a spot bitcoin ETF \u2014 with Coinbase as its custodial partner.\n\nIt should be no surprise that BlackRock would choose to work with Coinbase for its ETF, as they have long been strategic partners. Still, the entry of old-world wealth into the bitcoin realm is raising red flags in the community.\n\nOn a recent On the Margin podcast (Spotify/Apple), Mark Yusko expresses some of the fears of handing over the keys \u2014 both figuratively and cryptographically \u2014 to the institutions.\n\nBitcoin community seems unenthused\n\nWhile the notion of large-scale, heavily regulated investment entering bitcoin appears on the surface to be highly bullish for the industry, not everyone is enthused. Concerns about some sort of hostile takeover are swirling in the community.\n\nThe founder of Morgan Creek Capital Management says Xapo, the institutional-scale crypto custody tool that Coinbase acquired in 2019, could come into regulatory play.\n\n\u201cWhat if,\u201d he asks, BlackRock can \u201ctake over this storage unit?\u201d\n\nBlackRock would then hold a significant portion of crypto assets in America, he says. \u201cAnd if they have the bulk of it,\u201d regulators could then shut down the Coinbase exchange as an SEC-alleged \u201cunlicensed casino\u201d and hand the Xapo unit over to BlackRock.\n\nHost Ippolito adds that the response from the Bitcoin community has been \u201cpretty roundly negative\u201d regarding the ETF application.\n\n\u201cIn the filing, there\u2019s a little paragraph about what BlackRock would do in the event of a hard fork,\u201d Ippolito says. \u201cBlackRock is going to have to make a decision.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\n\u201cIn the event of a hard fork,\u201d Ippolito explains, \u201cthere will be two different copies of Bitcoin.\u201d As has happened in previous forks, one of the two will be selected as the canonical chain.\n\n\u201cAnd BlackRock\u2019s gonna have to make a decision about that.\u201d\n\nFears swirl around the possibilities of BlackRock closing off access to what some would perceive as the preferred fork, but Ippolito is concerned with \u201cthe Bitcoin community\u2019s pushback.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes me think that they don\u2019t really understand social consensus,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want Bitcoin to keep going up and be widely adopted you need larger and larger buyers.\u201d\n\nYusko responds to the community\u2019s backlash against undesirable money entering the scene, \u201cYou want any and all fiat of any kind in any variety to convert to bitcoin because the bigger the network, the bigger the safety, security, the more adoption.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only way the value of a network goes up.\u201d\n\nShort the future, long the physical\n\nHaving said that, Yusko admits it\u2019s \u201chypothetically possible that since November of last year, when the futures-based ETF was issued,\u201d that large institutions like JPMorgan and Blackrock have been \u201cshorting the shit out of bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s highly likely,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have proof in the gold market that they do. Every year, they make billions of dollars shorting the future and going long the physical.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan can pay a billion dollar fine for market manipulation, Yusko says, but make $20 billion in the process. \u201cSo that\u2019s 5%. Who cares? It\u2019s the cost of doing business.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s not all dark clouds for Yusko. He sees the BlackRock filing as a potential turning point in the market from bearish to bullish. \u201cWe said on this show that crypto summer would start on June 15.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd BlackRock files the papers on June 15. That is just dumb luck. And it\u2019s possible we made the bottom.\u201d\n\nYusko remains confident in bitcoin\u2019s future, although he expects things to be messy for a while.\n\n\u201cJPMorgan, BlackRock and all of the controllers of the money and power felt threatened \u2014 as they should have \u2014 by a disruptive innovation that will replace them. The infrastructure of trust will be replaced by the infrastructure of truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut man, the war is gonna be bloody.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) emerges from a hectic macro week to circle some classic trend lines near $26,000 \u2014 what could happen next?\n\nAfter some brutal tests of traders\u2019 resolve over the past seven days, the BTC price is still determined to hold familiar ground.\n\nMarket participants are in \u201cwait and see\u201d mode as a lack of clear direction characterizes the largest cryptocurrency at the start of a new week\u2019s trading.\n\nUnited States holidays mean traditional markets will only open on June 20, giving at least one day\u2019s grace before any surprises hit.\n\nThere is still plenty left to deal with from last week, however, including BlackRock filing for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). Rumors are now that Fidelity Investments might follow.\n\nWhat will it take to inspire BTC price to adopt a trend? Cointelegraph looks at some of the major topics now under discussion among traders and analysts.\n\nNo relief for nervous Bitcoin traders\n\nThe latest weekly close for BTC/USD yielded little change over the past seven days.\n\nAt just above $26,000, \u201csideways\u201d is the name of the game for the pair, which weathered a slew of potential volatility triggers over the week.\n\nA trip to new three-month lows was short-lived, however, and traders are now cautiously waiting for new cues on the direction while not yet defaulting to a bearish view.\n\n\u201cI remain long while we show no signs of a reversal,\u201d Crypto Tony said in a summary of his position on the day.\n\n\u201cLooking for that trend line test at $26,900, and following a flip of that we then have $27,300 to note then up and away. Step by step we move.\u201d\n\nFellow trader Koala argued that upside and downside extremes centered on a $4,000-wide corridor, with lows likely to get swept before a return to $27,000.\n\n\u201cA set of equal highs and equal lows. I think we run the equal lows before the equal highs,\u201d he argued.\n\n\u201cThe demand area is where I\u2019m interested in bidding for a run higher (invalidation is quite obvious) If demand holds, then 27k+. Otherwise, 23kish.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart.

Any move above 28.5k and we will have broken a key market structure level that would imply that our corrective structure has completed and we may have begun a new impulsive move,\u201d he wrote in part of a recent analysis alongside an explanatory chart.\n\n\u201cA low timeframe move below GREEN is OK, because (as per previous posts), my HTF bias is bullish above 20k.

However, a growing U.S. regulatory crackdown recently tempered some investors' enthusiasm.\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC launched charges against the two biggest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. The declines in liquidity might be due to crypto trading platforms losing access to dollar payment systems.\n\nAn instance is seen when BinanceUS announced the suspension of USD deposits after its banking partners paused fiat (USD) withdrawal channels.\n\nThe drop in liquidity might also point to a waning appetite for Bitcoin at its recent higher levels as crypto regulation returns to the spotlight.\n\nImpact on price\n\nThe impact on price might be thus: there is little support for not only the downside but the upside as well. Also, the market might be subject to volatility swings until the needed injection of liquidity is achieved.\n\nBitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market are putting up lackluster performance at the start of the week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was marginally higher in the last 24 hours, at $26,526.\n\nThis week, investors will be paying close attention to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee to get a grasp of the next direction for the U.S. economy. CME projects the probability of the Fed raising interest rates by 25 basis points in its July 26 meeting to be 77%."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization is once again larger than that of all other cryptocurrencies combined, according to data from TradingView.\n\nThe site\u2019s BTC dominance metric rose above 50% on Monday for the first time since May 2021, when Bitcoin\u2019s price plummeted after China announced a total ban on crypto mining, and Tesla partly distanced itself from the asset over environmental concerns.\n\nWATCH: The exact moment Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) on Trading View crosses 50% for the first time in over 2 years pic.twitter.com/VQoKtZ71cY \u2014 Pledditor (@Pledditor) June 19, 2023\n\nBitcoin dominance last neared the 50% mark in June 2022 as the entire crypto market cratered on news of persistently high inflation in the United States, leading to aggressive monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve.\n\n\n\nWhile Bitcoin dropped dramatically at the time, coins like Ethereum (ETH) dropped harder, with the ETH/BTC pair falling to a ratio of just 0.05.\n\nA similar decline took place this month as ETH/BTC fell from 0.07 on June 6 to 0.064 at writing time.\n\nOther top altcoins\u2014including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC)\u2014also suffered substantially relative to Bitcoin following a US regulator\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase alleging that all three coins are unregistered securities. Meanwhile, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has again clarified that he views Bitcoin as a commodity.\n\nIn a lawsuit against Binance, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) called the exchange\u2019s native token BNB a security. The token\u2014the fourth largest crypto by market cap\u2014has plummeted 20% since the start of the month.\n\nBitcoin Retakes $29,000 Amid First Republic Bank Uncertainty\n\nThe Bitcoin dominance metric has often been criticized for under-representing Bitcoin\u2019s true market share by including stablecoins within its calculations, which are effectively dollars trading on the blockchain. However, even the stablecoin market has receded this year after Paxos was forced by the SEC to start winding down BUSD in February, erasing billions of dollars in tokens from circulation.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast Tuesday, MicroStrategy\u2019s executive chairman Michael Saylor predicted that Bitcoin dominance will rise above 80% as regulators continue clamping down on other digital assets.\n\nRegulatory clarity is going to drive #Bitcoin adoption by eliminating the confusion & anxiety that has been holding back institutional investors. Bitcoin dominance will continue to grow as the #Crypto industry rationalizes around $BTC and goes mainstream. pic.twitter.com/Foq4lpderj \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) June 13, 2023\n\nBitcoin is up 6% since last week after BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin Spot ETF, for which investors are optimistic may receive unique approval from the SEC."

        "content": "A wind farm in Norway. Rich in cheap hydro and wind power, the country is among Europe's last crypto hubs.\n\nSource: dmathies/iStock via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nOwners of datacenters and crypto-mining operations are claiming that their businesses, far from being a drag on electric systems, can help integrate renewables and balance grids.\n\nWith its Renewable Bitcoin Quarq Spread Index, S&P Global Commodity Insights tracks the profitability of mining bitcoin, accounting for the costs of renewable certificates using Platts Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) and Platts Guarantee of Origin (GOs) data.\n\nWhile mining is in the money in key markets, according to the index, during times of low crypto prices and high electricity prices, miners have profited from opting out of consumption from the grid, sometimes earning more than from the mining activities themselves.\n\nSome sector pioneers now point to crypto mining's ability to capture energy from renewables that otherwise would have been curtailed, improving project economics and enabling more development in low-price regions.\n\nPart of this trend is a pivot to smaller-scale behind-the-meter installations, according to the founders of a US mining startup.\n\n\"Our view isn't that you should throw up a bunch of generation assets so that you can mine bitcoin,\" said Andrew Webber, founder and CEO of Digital Power Optimization Inc. (DPO), an energy services startup developing behind-the-meter computing solutions for renewables assets.\n\n\"When you really pencil out that math, it's very hard to make that work,\" Webber said. \"It can't be the only thing that you're doing with that energy asset.\"\n\nInstead, Webber and business partner Alex Stoewer, COO of DPO, see co-located mining behind the meter as an optimization tool that reduces curtailment or sales into a low power price environment, as well as an enabler for fresh renewables in regions where power is cheap.\n\nDPO has also been able to fund maintenance for an old hydroelectric plant in central Wisconsin after acquiring it and adding computing capacity on-site. Built in 1908, the 6.8-MW Hatfield Hydro Project would have otherwise eventually been decommissioned, Stoewer said.\n\nNorwegian official: Mining seizes valuable resources\n\nSimilar concepts could work in unlocking more development in regions in Africa that anticipate population growth, the startup founders say. Meanwhile, Europe \"has better uses for [its] power,\" said Stoewer.\n\nIndeed, the energy crisis only reinforced European lawmakers' attention on energy efficiency and potential drains on supply, and regulatory winds are changing for bitcoin miners as a result.\n\nOne of Europe's more active mining markets is Norway, which offers affordable and clean power due to large hydroelectric and wind reserves. About 250 MW of capacity is estimated to be powering mining in the country, mostly in the northernmost price zones where electricity remains comparatively affordable.\n\n\"We see the energy situation as demanding and that crypto mining is seizing valuable power resources,\" Norway's state secretary, Elisabeth S\u00e6ther of the Labour Party, said in an email to S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\nWhile grid operators are obligated to connect new power end users to the grid \u2014 as well as to award increased capacity to existing end users \u2014 on a nondiscriminatory basis, queues for grid connection have lengthened in Norway due to rising demand from various sectors, S\u00e6ther said.\n\nTo tackle this, the government laid out an action plan earlier in spring that proposes introducing new prioritization criteria for grid connections based on the maturity of projects that request grid connections.\n\nThese criteria also include financing and plans for load usage, and the minister stressed that this filter will not discriminate against any particular sector.\n\nHowever, in an upcoming revision of the Norwegian Act on Electronic Communications, the government is expected to propose new obligations for all datacenter operators, including crypto miners. The bill is set for a vote in mid-June. The government is also revising its national Data Centre Strategy, S\u00e6ther said.\n\nNeighbor Sweden, also a hub for mining in Europe, has also indicated that it is prioritizing resources for other ventures such as hydrogen-based steel or chemicals production.\n\nBitcoin passes baton to artificial intelligence\n\nWhile major miners may be relegated to the back of the queue, Sweden remains a hub for flexible datacenters joined with renewables projects, Hungarian startup founder Daniel Jogg said.\n\nHis flexible datacenter startup, Enerhash Technologies, has developed projects across Europe and beyond, advising asset owners like E.ON SE subsidiary E.ON Hung\u00e1ria Zrt. or Sweden's Vattenfall AB on leveraging flexible datacenters for balancing volatility.\n\nEurope has not experienced negative wholesale power prices for the past few years, but with an increase in solar installed capacity and weaker demand, negative power prices have reemerged \u2014 a trend datacenter developers say bolsters their business case.\n\nWhen two reactors at the Forsmarks k\u00e4rnkraftverk nuclear plant in Sweden went down in April, Jogg said 200 MW of flexible computing was able to ramp down as a high-frequency demand response mechanism to balance the grid.\n\nEnerhash also works with oil and gas field owners in the Middle East who are looking for better uses for flared gas by powering datacenters, as well as US oil and gas developer Allied Energy Corp.\n\nMeanwhile, datacenter demand is set to triple in the next decade thanks to AI computing power, making datacenters a promising part of the flexibility puzzle, Jogg said.\n\nThe energy companies Jogg works with are rarely interested in mining bitcoin for profit, he said. \"They are solving their problems. They are entering this business because they have the best synergies with datacenters. 95% of the time, they say, 'Do what you want with the bitcoin stuff, we need the datacenter.'\"\n\nStigmatized cryptocurrencies\n\nIntegrated behind-the meter applications do not face the long grid connection queues that standalone miners would, DPO's Webber said.\n\nDozens of utilities and independent power producers in the US are keen to invest in such capabilities, Webber said, but refrain from disclosing early pilots and investments because of the \"stigma\" attached to cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe 6-MW Hatfield hydro plant in Wisconsin, restored by DPO and partner Wiconi Hydro.\n\nSource: Cascade Digital Power\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's an interesting proposition, but it's just such a risky market,\" said Jonathan Schroth, a research analyst on the datacenter infrastructure and services team for 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nPart of the challenge is the price of devices used to mine bitcoin via proof of work technology, which had peaked between $13,000 and $15,000 per unit, Schroth said. A pivot away from proof of work mining is possible, but Schroth said it bears a risk of stranded assets.\n\nInvestors who are uncomfortable with cryptocurrencies are eyeing other segments such as AI computing, which also requires large amounts of electricity, Webber said.\n\nTexas remains attractive as crypto bill fails to pass\n\nMuch of the mining activity behind bitcoin is based in the US, where conditions for mining remain more favorable.\n\nAbout 38% of bitcoin's global hashrate, the computational power used by the blockchain network, is generated in the US, according to December 2021 data \u2014 the most recent available \u2014 from the University of Cambridge's Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Within the US, the state of Georgia had by far the largest share of activity, at nearly 31%, according to the index.\n\nThe majority of US-based crypto mining relies on fossil fuel-derived electricity, said David Shargel, a partner at law firm Bracewell in New York, adding that miners are increasingly hunting for new ways to tap into renewables. \"They recognize they may not be welcome within the traditional grid,\" Shargel said.\n\n\"What we mostly see are folks artificially elongating the lifespan of a fossil fuel-powered plant,\" said Schroth, pointing to the example of beleaguered miner Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc., which made headlines for using a coal plant in New York later converted to run on natural gas to power its activities.\n\nIn January, New York became the first state to ban crypto mining derived from fossil fuels, and even some Texas lawmakers have recently tried to chip away at the state's mining cohort.\n\n\"For a couple of years now, Texas has been extremely attractive. Part of the incentive was providing a monetary reward for crypto mining operations that were able to shed load, stop their operations when load was at peak,\" Shargel said.\n\nTo limit this, Texas state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican, told a state Senate committee hearing in March that Texas' booming digital mining industry is planning to add 37 GW of additional load to the state and no longer needs state incentives to thrive.\n\nS.B. 1751, a bill sponsored by Kolkhorst, proposed that miners should only earn credits for demand response services if they comprise less than 10% of services procured by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas Inc.\n\nThe bill progressed through the Texas Senate amid strong pushback from the industry but ultimately did not pass after being halted by the House of Representatives in late May.\n\nShargel does not expect interventions to reduce mining activity in the US. \"The mining industry will be here to stay for at least some time. The miners are going to continue to find the optimal locations and sources of power,\" Shargel said.\n\nS&P Global Commodity Insights reporter Maxim Grama produces content for distribution on Platts Dimensions Pro.

        "content": "After a momentary retest of the $25,000 support on June 15, Bitcoin gained 6.5% as bulls successfully defended the $26,300 level. Despite this, the general sentiment remains slightly bearish as the cryptocurrency has declined by 12.7% in two months.\n\nThe dismissal of Binance.US\u2019s temporary restraining order by Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States district court is somewhat related to investors\u2019 sentiment improving. On June 16, the exchange reportedly reached an agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), avoiding the freeze of its assets.\n\nOn a longer timeframe, the global regulatory environment has been extremely harmful to cryptocurrency prices. Besides the SEC trying to unilaterally label exactly which altcoins it views as securities and litigating with the two leading global exchanges, the European Union signed the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations into law on May 31. This means crypto businesses have set timelines to implement and comply with MiCA\u2019s requirements.\n\nCuriously, while Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) performance has been lackluster, on June 16, the S&P 500 Index reached its highest level in 14 months. Even with this recovery, JPMorgan strategists expect the rally to come under pressure in the second half of 2023 \u201cif growth stalls in absolute terms.\"\n\nInvestors will keep their focus on the U.S. central bank, with Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell set to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on June 21 and the Senate Banking Committee on the morning of June 22 as part of his semi-annual testimony before lawmakers.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Bitcoin derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned amid weaker macroeconomic perspectives.\n\nBitcoin margin and futures show mild demand for leverage longs\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because they allow investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nOKX, for instance, provides a margin-lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. Traders can increase their exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of a cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin-lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin-lending ratio has been declining since June 10, indicating the overwhelming dominance of longs is over. The present 23:1 ratio favoring stablecoin lending still favors bulls but sits near the lowest levels in five weeks.\n\nInvestors should also analyze the Bitcoin futures long-to-short metric, as it excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets.\n\nExchanges\u2019 top traders' Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nTop traders at OKX vastly decreased their shorts on June 15 as the Bitcoin price plunged to its lowest level in three months at $24,800. However, those traders were not comfortable keeping a ratio that favored longs, and it has since moved back to a 0.80 ratio, in line with the two-week average.\n\nThe opposite movement happened at Binance, as top traders reduced their long-to-short ratio to 1.18 on June 15 but subsequently added longs, and the indicator stands at 1.25. Albeit an improvement, Binance\u2019s top traders' long-to-short ratio is presently in line with the previous two-week average.\n\nRelated: Hawkish Fed, stocks market rally, and crypto falling behind\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price gains are capped despite resilience in derivative metrics\n\nOverall, Bitcoin bulls lack the confidence to leverage long positions using margin and futures markets. BTC lacks momentum as investors\u2019 attention has shifted to the stock market after the Fed decided to pause its interest rate hikes, improving the outlook for corporate earnings.\n\nDespite the extremely negative regulatory pressure, professional traders did not flip bearish, according to Bitcoin derivatives metrics. However, bears have the upper hand as the 20-day resistance at $27,500 strengthens, limiting the short-term upside to a mere 3.8%.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "In an interview with Bloomberg, ARK Invest CEO and chief investment officer Cathie Wood recently discussed why her flagship fund, Ark Innovation (ARKK), is adding to its position in shares of Coinbase (COIN) after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance, one of Coinbase\u2019s biggest competitors.\n\nARKK purchased nearly 330,00 shares of COIN on June 6, 2023, worth about $17 million at the time, according to disclosure statements. Two other exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Ark Fintech Innovation ETF and Ark Next Generation Internet ETF, also added 35,700 shares (worth $1.8 million) and 53,900 shares (worth $2.8 million), respectively.\n\nAcross all three funds, Ark\u2019s average entry price is $272.75 to $282.93, with the firm\u2019s total position currently valued at $1.77 billion. At the time of writing, COIN is trading at $53.90. Needless to say, the fund is deeply in the red on this trade so far.\n\nAs far as why she\u2019s still bullish, her reasoning boils down to this: SEC enforcement will lead Coinbase to become the only game in town when it comes to cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States. Of course, this assumes that Coinbase will triumph in its own legal battles with the SEC.\n\nWood explained that she sees a difference in the accusations being brought against the two exchanges. While both are facing lawsuits by the SEC over the alleged trading and staking of unregistered securities, Binance may also be facing more serious charges.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao, or CZ for short, was faced with a civil enforcement action filed by the U.S. regulator for derivatives in March. The action alleges that CZ and three of the exchanges affiliates violated the Commodity Exchange Act and several regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nThese types of allegations \u201chave nothing to do with Coinbase,\u201d according to Wood. Therefore, she believes that Coinbase will survive the storm and emerge victorious, with its biggest competitor out of the picture.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say whether or not Wood\u2019s conviction on COIN can be considered well-justified. While some analysts share her view, others do not. The analyst consensus on the stock is a Hold rating, with an average price target of $58.49, or roughly 12% to the upside from current levels.\n\nSeveral notable analysts have come forward with more bullish price targets of $70, including John Todaro and Atlantic Equities.\n\nA 3-month chart of COIN. Source: TradingView\n\nThe relative strength index is almost perfectly neutral at a reading of 49.7, suggesting no decisive direction for COIN at this time.\n\nIt could be that COIN is the best and soon-to-be-only option when it comes to U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges. But this alone may or may not lead to COIN price appreciation.\n\nWhen evaluating the future prospects of an equity, most analysts tend not to look at one factor in isolation. Basing an investment thesis on the sole premise that a company\u2019s competitors may be doomed can lead analysts to ignore other, and perhaps even more important, factors.\n\nCould Coinbase also face criminal charges going forward?\n\nIt\u2019s worth repeating that Coinbase is also facing a lawsuit from the SEC regarding the trading and staking of unregistered securities. This could eventually lead to the exchange being deemed to have participated in illegal activities.\n\nBut perhaps even more concerning than SEC enforcement actions is the allegation that Coinbase may have invested in projects it planned to list on the exchange before they became available to the public.\n\nAfter Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong spoke with The Wall Street Journal on June 10, rumors started circulating that the company may have done just that. In the interview, Armstrong gave no adequate answer to a question concerning whether or not Coinbase invests in tokens listed on the platform.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that almost every single time a new token gets listed on Coinbase, the price tanks.\n\nIf this was, in fact, due to an orchestrated pump-and-dump scheme, it could constitute a financial crime of epic proportions.\n\nThe question is: Does any potential evidence exist for such a serious accusation?\n\nWell, yes and no.\n\nLooking at Coinbase Venture\u2019s portfolio, it does appear that as many as 30 projects that appeared in the company\u2019s investment portfolio were also listed on the exchange. However, Coinbase Ventures claims that it does not \u201ccoordinate with review and listings teams\u201d and is \u201crun and staffed separately from the main business.\u201d\n\nFactcheck: @brian_armstrong dodged the question on whether @Coinbase invests in tokens on the platform.\n\n\n\nI went through Coinbase Venture's entire portfolio, and found that these 30 projects were both part of their investment portfolio, as well as traded on @Coinbase exchange https://t.co/UCqy6kGpvK pic.twitter.com/ltPlhAh74x \u2014 Pledditor (@Pledditor) June 10, 2023\n\nWhile this does not necessarily mean that Coinbase used its exchange as a giant pump-and-dump scheme, it may point to one more thing for financial authorities to consider investigating. Needless to say, news of such an investigation would probably not bode well for the share price of COIN.\n\nRelated: SEC asks for more time to respond to Coinbase call for crypto clarity\n\nBitcoin to $1 million?\n\nIn her conversation with Bloomberg, Wood reiterated her view that \u201cBitcoin is a hedge against inflation.\u201d Yet she also noted that she sees deflation as a substantial risk going forward. Despite this, she remains bullish on the Bitcoin price, holding firm to her $1 million target.\n\nYear-to-date chart of BTC/USD.

On June 13, for example, the discount was closer to -44%.\n\nGBTC premium vs. asset holdings vs. BTC/USD chart (screenshot).

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBlackRock files for Bitcoin exchange-traded fund\n\nThe world\u2019s largest asset manager will use Coinbase Custody as a custodian\n\nBitcoin proponents predict a positive market impact\n\nAmerican investment firm BlackRock, which is rated as the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is looking to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund to give clients indirect exposure to the preeminent cryptocurrency.\n\nA filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that BlackRock\u2019s proposed iShares Bitcoin Trust would tap Coinbase Custody as its custodian partner. The firm previously launched a spot Bitcoin private trust for institutional clients in the U.S. in 2022.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s move comes at a precarious time for the cryptocurrency space in the U.S., with the SEC pursuing legal recourse against the likes of Coinbase and Binance.US for what it deems as unregistered securities offerings relating to a number of cryptocurrencies listed on the exchanges.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin ETF, and why does it matter?\n\nETFs are a type of investment fund that allows investors to buy and sell shares that represent underlying securities, such as stocks, bonds, commodities and in this case Bitcoin.\n\nETFs are designed to track the price performance of specific stocks or baskets of assets. ETF are typically traded on stock exchanges alongside individual stocks\n\nPerhaps most importantly, ETF are described as passively managed, in that they replicate or mirror the performance of an underlying asset without an investor having to buy the asset itself.\n\nIn this case, investors would buy shares of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually buying or holding BTC. As outlined in the SEC filing, Coinbase Custody would be the custodian of the underlying BTC of the ETF.\n\nWhen Bitcoin ETF?\n\nBlackRock is the latest investment firm to file for approval to offer its clients a Bitcoin ETF. It joins a fairly long list of investment firms and financial institutions that have sought clearance to offer a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. since 2017.\n\nGlobal investment firm VanEck looked to launch the first-ever Bitcoin spot ETF back in 2017 which was initially denied by the SEC. Van Eck would apply two more times, with a second application ruled out in November 2021 by the Commission.\n\nThe agency\u2019s reasoning was that the Van Eck Firm had not met standards to protect investors as well as prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices. VanEck persevered with a third Bitcoin ETF application in June 2022, imploring the SEC to reconsider its previous decisions.\n\nAgain the SEC denied VanEck\u2019s attempts to request a proposed rule change that would permit the listing of VanEck Bitcoin Trust shares in March 2023 .\n\nGemini, owned by the tech mogul Winklevoss twins, also saw its applications for Bitcoin ETFs barred by the SEC alongside SolidX. The SEC would also deny nine separate ETFs submitted by ProShares, Direxion and GraniteShares for approval in 2018.\n\nWhile the SEC has continuously denied Bitcoin ETF moves, its northern neighbor Canada adopted a different approach. The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) permitted Purpose Investments to launch a Bitcoin ETF in February 2021.\n\nPart of VanEck\u2019s argument in their third filing centered around American investors gaining exposure to the Bitcoin ETF being offered in Canada. The question still remains, when will the U.S. see a fully-fledged Bitcoin ETF?\n\nBullish for Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency proponents have painted an optimistic picture of the potential effect that a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF could have on the markets.\n\nFun being on @LizClaman show!!

While there are similarities between an ETF and a Trust, \u2018Pomp\u2019 explained why BlackRock went the route of the latter.\n\n\u201cThe products are technically different, especially around regulatory approvals, but the end result for investors are similar. GBTC is a trust. You can\u2019t redeem from the fund. BlackRock is a trust, but you can redeem it appears. That is a big win for investors if it happens.\u201d\n\nPompliano said that BlackRock would not have filed with the SEC \u2018without having confidence it will be approved as trust.\u2019 He added that \u2018Bitcoiners are inside the castle\u2019 of BlackRock, having met members of its team.\n\n\u201cWill be interesting to see how the public markets play out in the next bull market for investors who want BTC exposure but don\u2019t want to (or can\u2019t) hold the asset directly,\u201d Pompliano added.\n\nThe venture capitalist added that the possible approval of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF would lead to other Wall Street firms following suit, which would then lead to Bitcoin inflows.\n\nBlackrock is controlling the SEC, not the other way around.

        "content": "The bears lost an opportunity when they failed to sustain Bitcoin (BTC) below the $25,000 level this week. That may have attracted buying from the bulls who are attempting to start a recovery in Bitcoin and select altcoins.\n\nAdditionally, BlackRock\u2019s application to launch a Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded fund and the sustained strength in the United States equities markets may have helped improve crypto sentiment. Bitcoin is on track to finish the week with a minor gain of 2% and institutional buying in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust reduced its discount to Bitcoin spot from 44% on June 13 to 36.6%, according to CoinGlass data.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAlthough Bitcoin and select altcoins are trying to start a relief rally, the overall trend remains bearish. Therefore, short-term traders who buy for a pullback should consider booking profits or tightening their stops when the price struggles to break above stiff resistance levels.\n\nThe strategy may be different for long-term investors who may use the dips to strong support levels to acquire the cryptocurrencies of their choice. It is prudent to adopt a staggered buying approach as a runaway rally is unlikely.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the top five cryptocurrencies that are trying to start a recovery in the short term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin turned up sharply on June 15, trapping the aggressive bears who may have gone short on a break below $25,250. That may have caused a short squeeze in the near term, which propelled the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($26,403).\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to limit the relief rally at the 20-day EMA but a positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that the buyers are holding on to their positions in anticipation of a move higher.\n\nHowever, the bears are likely to have other plans as they will try to offer stiff resistance in the zone between the 20-day EMA and the resistance line of the descending channel. If the price turns down from this zone, the BTC/USDT pair may remain inside the channel for a while longer.\n\nBut if bulls drive the price above the channel, the pair will signal a potential trend change in the near term. The pair could then surge toward $31,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA on the four-hour chart has turned up and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive area, indicating that bulls have the upper hand in the near term. There is a minor resistance at $26,850, but if that is crossed, the pair may reach the resistance line of the channel near $27,600. This level may prove to be a difficult hurdle for the bulls to cross, but if they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $28,500.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate in the short term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA. That could pull the price down to the 50-simple moving average and eventually to the strong support zone between $25,250 and $24,800. A break below this zone may intensify selling.\n\nBNB price analysis\n\nBNB (BNB) has been in the thick of things for the past few days, but a positive sign is that the bulls did not allow the price to break the $220 support. This indicates demands at lower levels.\n\nBNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe first resistance on the upside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $252.50. If this level is scaled, the BNB/USDT pair may reach the 20-day EMA ($261). The bears will try to halt the recovery at this level. If they succeed, the pair may turn down toward $220.\n\nOn the contrary, if bulls propel the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could reach the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $272.50. This is a crucial level for the bears to defend because if it gives way, the pair may soar toward $305.\n\nBNB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, and the RSI has risen into the positive zone. This indicates that buyers are attempting a comeback. The bulls will have to overcome the barrier at $252.50 to gain strength. The pair could then rally to $265.\n\nOn the downside, the first support is at the 20-EMA. If this level breaks down, the pair could slip to the uptrend line. A break and close below this level will indicate that the bulls have given up. The pair could then retest the critical support at $220.\n\nLitecoin price analysis\n\nLitecoin (LTC) plunged below the symmetrical triangle pattern on June 10, indicating that bears have the upper hand. The sellers pulled the price below the immediate support at $75 on June 14 but could not build upon this move.\n\nLTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe sharp recovery in the past few days has pushed the LTC/USDT pair back above $75. This shows strong buying at lower levels. The bulls will next try to push the price to the 20-day EMA ($82), which is an important level to keep an eye on. If buyers clear this hurdle, the pair may rise to the 50-day SMA ($86).\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA and breaks below $70, it will signal the start of the downtrend. The first stop is likely to be $65 and then $60.\n\nLTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe strong recovery pushed the price above the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart, suggesting that the selling pressure is reducing. The moving averages are on the verge of completing a bullish crossover and the RSI has jumped into the positive territory, indicating that buyers are attempting a comeback.\n\nThere is a minor resistance at $80 but if bulls overcome this obstacle, the pair may accelerate to $85 and thereafter to $90. If bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to quickly yank the price back below $75.\n\nRelated: Binance sends cease and desist notice to fraudulent Nigerian entity\n\nOKB price analysis\n\nOKB (OKB) broke below the symmetrical triangle pattern on June 10, signaling the start of a deeper correction. A minor positive for the bulls is that they successfully defended the support at $30.50, indicating demand at lower levels.\n\nOKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has reached the 20-day EMA ($42.73), which is an important level to watch out for. If the price turns down from the current level, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. That could pose a serious threat to the $38.50 support. If this level gives way, the OKB/USDT pair may skid to $35 and eventually to $30.\n\nContrarily, if buyers thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bears may be losing their grip. The pair could then rise to the support line, which is likely to act as a formidable resistance. Buyers will have to kick the price above $48 to gain the upper hand.\n\nOKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair bounced off $38.50 with vigor but is facing resistance near $42.39. A minor positive in favor of the buyers is that the moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory.\n\nIf buyers thrust the price above $42.39, the pair may pick up momentum and soar to $46 where the bears are again expected to mount a strong defense.\n\nAnother possibility is that the price turns down and tumbles below the 20-EMA. That may indicate a possible range-bound action between $38.50 and $42.39 for some time.\n\nQuant price analysis\n\nQuant (QNT) rebounded off the $95 level with strength on June 16, indicating aggressive buying at the support.\n\nQNT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, the bears have not yet given up and they are fiercely defending the downtrend line. Sellers will try to sink the price below $95 while the bulls will try to maintain the QNT/USDT pair above it.\n\nIf the price turns up from $95 once again, it will enhance the prospects of a rally above the downtrend line. If that happens, the pair may start a strong recovery that could catapult the price to $135.\n\nThis positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price continues lower and plummets below $95. The pair may then slip to $87 and subsequently to $80.\n\nQNT/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair quickly gave back a major portion of its gains, indicating that bears are active at higher levels. They pulled the price below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $103.90, which is a negative sign.\n\nBuyers will have to quickly drive the price back above the moving averages if they want to have another shot at the downtrend line. Alternatively, if the price sustains below the 50-SMA, the likelihood of a drop to $95 increases.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin dipped on Monday morning in Asia after reclaiming the US$26,000 support level over the weekend. Ether also fell back, but held above US$1,700. XRP, Dogecoin and Litecoin were the only gainers among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, while Tron\u2019s TRX led the losers. The U.S.-based crypto exchange Bakkt reportedly joined other trading platforms in delisting Polygon, Solana and Cardano after the U.S. regulator this month labelled them illegally issued financial securities. U.S. equity markets are closed Monday for a public holiday, but they could gain in the week ahead as economic data on Friday pointed to slowing inflation, while the first visit to China in almost five years by a top U.S. diplomat could be a positive for capital markets.\n\nBitcoin, Ether dip; XRP rises\n\nBitcoin fell 0.97% over the last 24 hours to US$26,308 at 07:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but held onto a weekly gain of 1.58%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency breached the US$26,000 level on Saturday to reach a seven-day high of US$26,769. The token had slumped to three-month lows at the end of last week.\n\nEther edged down 0.82% to US$1,716, logging a weekly loss of 2.18%.\n\nWith the exception of XRP, other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower in the past 24 hours. Polygon\u2019s Matic led the losers, slumping 3.22% to US$0.5971 and down 5.88% over the past seven days.\n\nNew York-based crypto exchange Bakkt has suspended trading of Polygon, Solana and Cardano tokens and plans to delist them, according to Fortune on Friday. Trading platforms such as Robinhood and eToro have also decided to delist multiple cryptocurrencies after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits this month against Coinbase and Binance.US and named a long list of cryptocurrencies as securities that were issued and sold without SEC approval.\n\n\u201cBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were affected by increasingly changing sentiment toward crypto as traders could limit their risk-taking in the crypto market due to limited upside catalysts and particularly considering the legal risks in the US,\u201d said Wael Makarem, senior market strategist at trading platform Exness Group, in emailed comments.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe legal actions could scare away some investors from the market but could be relatively positive for Bitcoin\u2019s dominance against other cryptocurrencies. In this regard, Bitcoin has also been gaining ground against Ethereum,\u201d said Makarem.\n\nThe Bitcoin balance on crypto exchanges reached a three-month low of 2,281,978.198 tokens on Sunday, according to blockchain data tracker Glassnode, which reduced some selling pressure as investors normally move tokens to exchanges when they plan to sell.\n\nXRP logged gains for the past 24 hours, rising 1.01% to US$0.4859, but losing 6.34% for the week.\n\nFinTech firm Ripple Labs, whose crypto payment platform is powered by XRP, announced on Friday a partnership with Columbia\u2019s central bank to explore the use of blockchain technologies in the country\u2019s digital payment system.\n\nLast Friday, MakerDAO\u2019s stablecoin Dai replaced Binance USD (BUSD) as the third largest stablecoin by market cap. BUSD has seen its market cap falling over 10% in the past seven days, after the SEC issued charges against Binance on June 5, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap dipped 0.53% to US$1.07 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 18.47% to US$19.69 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nEthereum NFT sales fall, Nike teases deal with Fortnite\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.16% to 2,878.56 in the 24 hours to 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 4.80% for the seven days.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum fell 20.61% in the past 24 hours to US$11.06 million, according to CryptoSlam data. Sales on the Bitcoin blockchain slid 44.71% to US$882,550.\n\n\u201cSales across Ethereum and Bitcoin continue to lose steam, and it\u2019s hard to say when this could turn around due to uncertainty with regulations and legal matters up in the air,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nDespite the decline, Sotheby\u2019s NFT auction saw Ringers #879, an Ethereum-based NFT created by Canadian artist Dmitri Cherniak, sell for US$6.2 million on Friday, the second highest sale of a piece of generative art, or created using autonomous systems.\n\n\u201cSotheby\u2019s auction concluded and saw $10.9m in sales, over half of which was from the Ringers grail,\u201d said Petscher, \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that the supposed buyer already a major NFT trader, so this auction didn\u2019t seem to draw attention from the traditional art world. Is it bullish still for NFT art? Yes, but there\u2019s still always concern that the NFT ecosystem is largely an echochamber.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the U.S. sportswear giant Nike released a teaser on Saturday which appears to be an NFT collaboration with online video game Fortnite, which will be unveiled on June 20. .SWOOSH, Nike\u2019s Web 3.0 platform that issues NFT sneakers, also announced a partnership with sports video game publisher EA Sports earlier this month.\n\n\u201cA new innovation has reached Ethereum called ethscriptions, inspired by inscriptions on Bitcoin. This new process allows you to inscribe tiny images (under 96kb) on mostly any Ethereum transaction, thus allowing cheap on-chain image storage,\u201d said Petscher.\n\n\u201cThe innovation here is the ease of storing an image on-chain, which is typically avoided in standard contract storage due to the high cost. In just a few days nearly 200ETH of secondary volume has been transacted, most from a sold out 10k collection of Ethereum Punks.\u201d\n\nU.S. futures trade mixed\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 11:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 0.10%, the S&P 500 inched up 0.01%, while Nasdaq futures added 0.16%. The U.S. stock market is closed Monday for a public holiday and will open on Tuesday.\n\nThe three major U.S. stock indexes all closed lower on Friday but logged gains for the week, as investors sorted through mixed signals from economic data and comments from Federal Reserve officials on Friday.\n\nA survey by the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumers expect annual inflation of 3.3% over the next year, the lowest since March 2021, but still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s goal of annual inflation below 2%.\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller and Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Thomas Barkin said on Friday that more interest rate hikes might be required to fight inflation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing policy rates having some effects on parts of the economy. The labor market is still strong, but core-kind of inflation is just not moving and that\u2019s going to require probably some more tightening to try to get that going down,\u201d said Waller in his Friday speech.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on July 26 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 28.1% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in July, and a 71.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike.\n\nMeanwhile in China, analysts expect the country\u2019s central bank to make a 10 basis-point cut to its one-year and five-year loan prime rates on Tuesday, lowering the rates to 3.55% and 4.20% as the country struggles with a slow post-Covid recovery, according to Reuters on Monday.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "SEC has approved Bitcoin futures ETFs in the past that holds futures contracts of Bitcoin, but there are no spot crypto ETFs as of now.\n\nUS-based asset manager BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, which manages $9.5 trillion in assets, has filed for a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). If approved, this could be the first such product in the crypto market, and it is expected to infuse fresh life into the depressed virtual digital assets.\n\nThe filing by the world\u2019s biggest asset manager has come at a time when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a tough stance against some of the world\u2019s biggest crypto firms, such as Coinbase and Binance.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nNotably, BlackRock picked the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase to serve as custodian for its Bitcoin product.\n\n\u201cBlackRock\u2019s move testifies the fact that Bitcoin is gaining the attention of leading financial institutions. It remains to be seen if SEC will approve the application but the digital asset ecosystem has received the much-needed push to enter the next phase of growth and mass adoption,\u201d said Shivam Thakral, Chief Executive Officer of BuyUcoin, a crypto exchange.\n\nIs it really an ETF?\n\nThe first point to note here is that there are many crypto-based investment products in the market. In fact, SEC has approved Bitcoin futures ETFs in the past that holds futures contracts of Bitcoin, but there are no spot crypto ETFs as of now.\n\nAlso read | Higher pension calculation: Should you opt for higher pension per EPFO\u2019s new formula? It\u2019s complicated\n\nThe first Bitcoin-based ETF, called the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), started trading in October 2021. BITO was one of the most sought-after funds after its launch as it became the fastest ETF across all categories, and hit the $1-billion mark in assets under management (AUM) in history.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nSince then, many other crypto-based ETFs, such as one on Ethereum, have come up in the market, but they have all been futures-based.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust application for establishing a \u2018Trust\u2019 is not an ETF in the traditional sense.\n\nWhat is an investment trust?\n\nIn crypto, an \u2018Investment Trust\u2019 is a closed-ended fund set-up as a company, which can buy and sell shares on an exchange. The trust invests in a portfolio of assets, and hence the value of the share of the fund is tied to the value of the underlying assets it holds.\n\nGiven that it is a closed-ended fund, the Net Asset Value (NAV) of each share can decouple from the asset\u2019s market price, and can show a huge divergence.\n\nGrayscale's Bitcoin Trust Product (GBTC) is the biggest crypto-based product available in the market, with AUM of more than $15 billion as of May end.\n\nUnlike GBTC, the BlackRock\u2019s Trust, if approved, will allow redemptions, which could be a big win for investors.\n\n\"The true difference in BlackRock\u2019s application is two-fold. BlackRock's involvement with Coinbase, particularly at this state of the market, is a confidence-inspiring move, and, secondly, to avoid previous criticism around spot-pricing feed. BlackRock plans to use the CF Benchmarks Index, created by a UK FCA-regulated firm. It is the same benchmark that is used by the CME to settle Bitcoin futures,\u201d said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\nAlso read | Using AI, Income-Tax department sends notices to tax evaders for fake donations\n\nIt is worth highlighting that this is not BlackRock's first foray into crypto. Last year, in August, the asset manager launched a spot Bitcoin private trust for institutional clients in the US.\n\nTo be sure, the BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin product is technically a \u2018Trust\u2019 and not an ETF in the traditional sense. But its Trust is proposed to work like an ETF.\n\nChances of approval\n\nIn the past, applications for launching spot crypto ETFs by asset managers, such as VanEck, Ark Invest, and Bitwise, have all been rejected by the regulator.\n\nThe SEC has maintained that spot Bitcoin is not safe enough to be offered to retail investors. The rejections were based on the ETFs\u2019 inability to meet SEC rules, which are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\n\nThe issue was so contentious that, last year, Grayscale sued the SEC after it rejected the application to convert GBTC into an ETF. While a trust is a preferred medium of institutional investors, an ETF is a favourite vehicle for retail investors, which increases penetration and depth of an asset class.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s success in getting SEC approvals inspires confidence among sceptics and investors alike. In its history, the fund manager has applied for 576 ETFs with the SEC, with just one being disapproved so far.\n\nBlackRock has included a \u201csurveillance-sharing agreement\u201d between exchanges in its application, which will help allay SEC\u2019s concerns about market manipulation and potentially tipping the odds in favour of the asset manager\u2019s application.\n\nImplications if ETF is approved\n\nDhruvil Shah, Vice-President of Technology at Liminal, a wallet infrastructure and custody solutions platform, said: \u201cBlackRock's move to launch a Bitcoin ETF in the face of regulatory scrutiny shows that it is committed to adopting digital assets and offering alternative investment options. Despite the SEC's latest actions, BlackRock's action demonstrates its confidence in the future of digital assets.\u201d\n\nAlso read | Sovereign Gold Bond 2023-2024 Series I opens today: Should you invest?\n\nBlackRock's Bitcoin ETF differs from earlier ETFs as it would be a spot ETF, meaning it would hold actual Bitcoins on its book.\n\n\u201cBlackRock ETF would actually have to buy the spot BTC and as a result, demand will go up, at least for the amount Bitcoin is removed from circulation. There is no doubt that it will lead to a price rise and significant sentiment rise,\u201d said Ajeet Khurana, Founder and CEO of Reflexical, a crypto advisory firm.\n\nFurther, a Bitcoin-based spot ETF, with a redemption option is expected to bring the price of the fund close to the asset class. At present, the units of the GBTC, which is a Grayscale BTC Trust, is trading at a 40 percent discount to the price of Bitcoin itself, a major drawback of an Investment Trust.\n\nMinal Thukral, Executive Vice President, Growth and Strategy, CoinDCX, added: \u201cThis could lead to more institutional investors investing in Bitcoin, which could have a significant impact on the price of the crypto. Though it is still too early to say the impact of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF on the market, it could be a major step forward for the overall crypto industry.\u201d\n\nTakeaway for investors\n\nBitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, is currently trading around the $26,500 level, which is a far cry from its all-time high of $69,045, hit on November 10, 2021.\n\nAlso read | Motilal Oswal\u2019s Nifty Microcap 250 Index fund aims to pick tomorrow\u2019s multibaggers today. Should you invest?\n\nIn the past, the crypto market has reacted in a much more enthusiastical manner to the positive developments in the market.\n\nFor example, when the first Bitcoin-based ETF -- ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF \u2013 was approved in October 2021, the crypto market had jumped more than 10 percent. Today, on a seven-day period, Bitcoin is up around 3 percent.\n\nWhile BlackRock is the biggest asset manager in the world and has an excellent track record in getting product approvals, it is yet to be seen whether the SEC will give the go-ahead to a spot Bitcoin ETF at a time when it has sued major crypto exchanges for trading unregistered securities, and alleged poor practices."

        "content": "Equipping developers with the tools to build decentralized applications whilst tapping into unmatched Bitcoin security\n\nPalo Alto, California --News Direct-- Chainwire\n\nBitcoin security sharing protocol Babylon has successfully deployed a major upgrade to its testnet. V0.7.1 of the network introduces comprehensive smart contract capabilities built using the popular CosmoWasm and Wasmd framework. It allows developers to extract security from Bitcoin to secure their applications and blockchains by deploying Babylon smart contracts.\n\nThe community has been eagerly anticipating this upgrade ever since Babylon's initial testnet launch four months ago. During this period, Babylon's testnet has drawn significant interest and integrated with 28 of the top Cosmos SDK chains, including Osmosis, Akash, Sei Network, Injective, Evmos, and Stride, thereby demonstrating traction for its technology. The integration arguably makes these Cosmos chains the most secure PoS chains in the world, as the solution combines the best of both worlds, Proof of Stake (PoS) & Proof of Work (PoW) security mechanisms. Additionally, channeling the value of PoS ecosystems into the Bitcoin network.\n\nThis upgrade extends Babylon's capabilities beyond the Cosmos ecosystem, enabling it to cater to a broader range of applications. It positions Babylon as a robust platform for developing decentralized applications for all verticals, especially DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi, where security is top priority.\n\nDavid Tse, Co-Founder of Babylon, said: \u201cWe are thrilled to announce the launch of Babylon v0.7.1, introducing the integration of smart contracts. This marks a crucial milestone for Babylon, turning it into a powerful platform for deploying a wide range of protocols, thereby facilitating the development of decentralized applications secured by the strength of the Bitcoin network.\n\nThis upgrade also paves the path to a spectacular Bitcoin-centric ecosystem. Babylon is leading the R&D of advanced scaling and security sharing protocols to fully unleash the potential of Bitcoin. Through Babylon smart contracts, the mighty power of Bitcoin will be readily at the disposal of the applications built on Babylon.\n\nStory continues\n\nBabylon recently announced the pioneering Bitcoin Staking Protocol, which enables Bitcoin the asset to be staked and used to secure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chains. This is achieved without altering the Bitcoin blockchain nor any bridging. In return, participating Bitcoin holders can earn rewards for contributing to the security of PoS networks.\n\nAbout Babylon\n\nBabylon is a project that designs security protocols for the decentralized world. Babylon\u2019s origins come from a research paper about Bitcoin security co-authored by co-founder of Babylon David Tse, a professor at Stanford and Ethereum 2.0 researcher, and the founder of EigenLayer Sreeram Kannan, and their colleagues. The project is led by a team of consensus protocol researchers from Stanford and experienced layer 1 engineers from around the world.\n\nBabylon's mission is to scale Bitcoin to secure the decentralized world. To achieve this, Babylon utilizes the three primary facets of Bitcoin: Bitcoin as an asset, its reliable timestamping service, its most censorship-resistant blockspace in the world,. To leverage these facets, Babylon is developing three innovative security-sharing protocols: Bitcoin Staking Protocol, Bitcoin Timestamping Protocol, and Bitcoin Data Availability Protocol. Through these pioneering protocols, Babylon envisions a more secure and decentralized future.\n\nLearn more: https://www.babylonchain.io/\n\nContact Details\n\nShalini Wood\n\nswood@babylonchain.io\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/babylon-v0-7-1-goes-live-with-smart-contract-capabilities-and-bitcoin-security-for-dapps-728634553"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA pricy Ethereum NFT from one of Web3\u2019s preeminent PFP collections has been permanently removed from circulation and symbolically tied to an Ordinals inscription, as a group of Bitcoiners celebrate the costly, eye-catching endeavor.\n\nCryptoPunk #8611 sold for around 55 Ethereum or $95,000 on Saturday, according to Etherescan. And hours later, the NFT was burned in a way that points to inscription 12,456,749, an NFT-like asset on Bitcoin that bears the same image as its predecessor.\n\nThe decision to effectively destroy CryptoPunk #8611 was a community-led effort conducted by Wolf Capital Developer Nathan Stein on Twitter and holders of Bitcoin Bandits, a Western-themed collection of Ordinals inscriptions, a spokesperson for the project told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe community rallied behind the idea like crazy,\u201d the Bitcoin Bandits spokesperson said, adding that around 150 people contributed to the cause.\n\nWhen a digital asset is burned, it\u2019s locked up for eternity in a digital wallet that nobody controls, and CryptoPunk #8611 has been put to rest in a well-known burn address that also contains $21 million worth of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWhat a wild night,\u201d an account named Minh on Twitter told Decrypt, who also posted a video documenting the purchase and burning of CryptoPunk #8611. He described the move as \u201cchaotic, yet beautiful.\u201d\n\nOrdinals, a buzzy Bitcoin protocol that launched earlier this year, is used to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by \u201cinscribing\u201d data to individual satoshi, the smallest denomination of currency a Bitcoin can be broken down into. That data can include pictures, videos, or even plain text, which people have used to create BRC-20 tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile NFTs could be considered a nascent industry or an emerging frontier for digital art, Ordinals inscriptions are much more new, leading to a wave of hype, bugs, and scams surrounding crypto\u2019s oldest coin.\n\nAs the community surrounding Ordinals continues to take shape, siphoning off pricy NFTs from the Ethereum space and pointing them in the direction of other assets on Bitcoin is becoming a more common move, referred to as teleburning.\n\nSo, if Saturday\u2019s CryptoPunk burn sounds somewhat familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s not the first time a pricy NFT has been burned by someone looking to symbolically shift an asset\u2019s underlying chain from Ethereum to Bitcoin.\n\nIn February, an NFT from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection worth around $169,000 at the time was burned by Jason Williams, who told Decrypt not long after that, essentially, \u201cthrowing a Lamborghini into a trash compactor\u201d is kind of fun.\n\nNotably, Yuga Labs, creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, told Decrypt that the Ordinals inscription tied to Williams\u2019 BAYC NFT represents an illegitimate ape, explaining only tokens that come from the project's original smart contract are considered valid, granting holders commercial rights and access to events.\n\nHowever, unlike Williams\u2019 maneuver, CryptoPunk #8611 wasn\u2019t burned purely for entertainment, according to Stein.\n\nThe end goal is to create a series of Ordinals inscriptions that correspond to a slice of ownership in CryptoPunk #8611\u2014even though the underlying asset itself can no longer be owned by anyone on its original chain.\n\nThat collection of inscriptions will be created after the one that currently points to CryptoPunk #8611 is ceremonially sent to a digital wallet that belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, in what is effectively a one-way trip, Stein said in a tweet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPhase #2 1- Send money to escrow\n\n2- Escrow buys Punk for them\n\n3- Escrow burns & inscribes it on BTC\n\n4- Escrow sends the punk to Satoshis wallet Ok! Now we have burned Punk 2 times LMAO Whats next? \u2014 NatanStein (@natan_stein) June 16, 2023\n\nMembers of the Bitcoin Bandits community who pooled funds together to purchase CryptoPunk #8611 have also been entered into a contest related to a separate inscriptions project\u2014but that\u2019s beside the point, the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cBandits did it more to show the way,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe Bandits Community thinks that CryptoPunks deserve better than ETH.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin Whale Removes Nearly $400 million In BTC From Binance - NewsBTC",
        "content": "A massive Bitcoin transaction was spotted on the blockchain recently, indicating a whale may be moving their funds into self-custody. Data shows a Bitcoin whale has withdrawn $395.8 million from Binance to an unknown wallet, a sign that may be bullish for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nMassive Bitcoin Transaction Spotted on the Blockchain\n\nAccording to the data provided by Whale Alert, a cryptocurrency transaction tracker, a whale recently transferred 15,000 BTC away from Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. At the current market price, these Bitcoins are worth around $395.878 million.\n\nThis is one of the largest single transactions involving Bitcoin that has been reported so far this year. Although the recipient address is unknown, the amount of the transaction suggests that it was likely an institutional investor or high net worth individual also known as a \u201cwhale\u201d who wanted complete control of their digital assets.\n\nHow Self-Custody Is Good For The Price Of Bitcoin\n\nIt is no new revelation that when dealing with digital assets, self-custody is the best way, especially on a large scale. By transferring from an exchange wallet into a private wallet, the whale now has sole control and responsibility over the private keys that can move the funds.\n\nFor many long term holders, this is a safer option than keeping large amounts of crypto on an exchange which could be at higher risk of hacks or scams.\n\nBTC recovers above $26,000 resistance | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nWhen whales make significant transactions, it can frequently cause price volatility. If this whale plans to hold their BTC long-term, it could signal confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s future value. On the other hand, if they were to sell a significant percentage of it, there would be an oversupply on the market, which would bring the price down, at least temporarily.\n\nAlso, when big players move their BTC off exchanges into self-custody wallets, it\u2019s usually a good sign for Bitcoin\u2019s price. Removing hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin from exchanges means less supply available for trading. This increases scarcity on exchanges, thereby increasing the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is now trading above $26,000 after breaking the $26,000 resistance during the weekend. With the next Bitcoin halving less than a year away, whales moving their assets into self-custody may send some ripples of bullish sentiment into the wider crypto industry.\n\nFeatured image from Coingape, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Already Bottomed, Sets Halving Price - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin has continued to struggle to sustain the $26,000 support level as bearish sentiment continues to dominate the market. Its drawdown in the last few weeks has led to speculations that the digital asset could be headed for a new cycle low. However, one crypto analyst firmly believes that Bitcoin has already marked its cycle bottom.\n\nCrypto Analyst PlanB Says $15,500 Was Bitcoin Bottom\n\nIn November 2022, FTX which was the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world at the time collapsed and filed for bankruptcy following a massive bank run. This collapse reverberated through the market and triggered a massive crash across crypto assets in the space. As a result, Bitcoin was in a freefall from above $30,000 before bottoming out at $15,500.\n\nIn January 2023, PlanB told his over 1.8 million Twitter followers that the $15,500 bottom of November 2022 was the cycle bottom for the market. The analyst believed that the digital asset would not fall below this level again and has now reiterated his stance once more.\n\nPlanB said in a tweet on Sunday that he stands by the earlier prediction he had made six months ago and that Bitcoin was going to rise going into the 2024 halving. At the same time, he also reiterated his $32,000 halving price in 2024.\n\nI still stand by my Jan 12 #Bitcoin view:\n\n\u2013 Nov 2022 $15.5K was the bottom (50% disagreed!)\n\n\u2013 Rise into 2024 halving (from $18K on Jan 12)\n\n\u2013 Next: halving price above $32K https://t.co/V74Y8VYCVo pic.twitter.com/bfEOEqiBAv \u2014 PlanB (@100trillionUSD) June 18, 2023\n\nThis means that the analyst expects the price of Bitcoin to actually rise from this level as a $32,000 price level would mean a 20% addition from the current price. Interestingly, the analyst also predicts that BTC\u2019s price will cross $100,000 in 2025.\n\nBTC Could See Further Upside\n\nThe current market trend could play into PlanB\u2019s forecast for the future of Bitcoin. The digital asset has now been consolidating toward the downside for a couple of weeks now which could mark an opportunistic level for a bounce. If this happens, the cryptocurrency could easily retake $30,000 as long as bulls are able to hold up momentum.\n\nBTC price reclaims $26,500 resistance | Souce: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nBTC has also successfully risen above its 100-day moving average, indicating a return of bullish sentiment among market participants. This was the case back in January 2023 before the rally and such a move could be replicated here once more.\n\nThe halving event is also drawing closer which has been a historically bullish event for the price of the digital asset. Each bull market has begun with a Bitcoin halving, thus providing ample reason to believe the next bull market will begin in 2024.\n\nPresently, the price of BTC is changing hands at a price of $26,519, down 0.35% in the last 24 hours but seeing gains of 1.53% on the weekly chart.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "On June 14, the Karnataka government ordered a probe into alleged irregularities in 114 works carried out by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) which reportedly resulted in losses exceeding Rs 118 crore. The government also sought a report from senior IAS officer Amlan Aditya Biswas while suspending eight engineers from the BBMP and Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Ltd (KRIDL), the government agency that carried out the works.\n\nThe suspension of eight engineers for irregularities including signing false documents which claimed that works were executed \u2013 mostly in Rajarajeshwarinagar constituency limits \u2013 comes as leaders of the ruling Congress government have promised to investigate all scams under the previous BJP government.\n\nCorruption was among the key planks on which the Congress fought the recent Assembly elections and secured a convincing victory. Following the same, demands have grown in recent days to institute inquiries into various scams raised by the party when it was in the Opposition. This includes the PSI scam, Bitcoin scam, allegations of 40 per cent corruption in government works and irregularities during the Covid-19 pandemic which rocked the BJP government in the last two years of its tenure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the government is yet to institute official inquiries into these charges, ministers have maintained that all irregularities will be probed, especially after being cornered by a section of BJP leaders in Karnataka that the Congress and some BJP leaders pursue \u201cadjustment politics\u201d and that due to a mutual understanding, none of the scams will be investigated.\n\nResponding to the allegations, Home Minister G Parameshwara said the government will re-examine the Bitcoin scam in the coming days. \u201cWe are in the government now. We are looking at everything. I am re-examining the Bitcoin case. We are doing it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe scam involves allegations regarding investigations into the crimes of notorious hacker Sriki. There are complaints that a nexus of politicians and policemen used the hacker\u2019s skills to transfer the Bitcoins Sriki had stolen to their own accounts. The issue had rocked the state during late 2021 and early 2022.\n\nAccording to Priyank Kharge, Minister for Rural Development & Panchayat Raj and IT/BT, discussions on investigating the BJP\u2019s scams had come up in the Cabinet meeting held last week. He said the government was deciding which teams should probe the scams as cases such as the Bitcoin scam required the services of experienced cybersecurity personnel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany other ministers in the state Cabinet too echoed these sentiments, insisting all illegalities committed during the BJP rule would be exposed in the coming months.\n\nMeanwhile, D Kempanna, president of Karnataka State Contractors\u2019 Association, told The Indian Express that they were seeking action against the irregularities committed in the past. The Association had earlier written to the Prime Ministers\u2019 Office alleging that commission to the tune of 40 per cent of the project cost was being demanded from contractors, embarrassing the BJP government under former chief minister Basavaraj Bommai.\n\nKempanna said Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was expected to \u201cconvene a meeting shortly to discuss their grievances. I am hoping that the meeting will be held in the next few days. We are seeking a public inquiry into our allegations,\u201d he said."

        "content": "In the ever-evolving crypto market, Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) continue to dominate headlines. However, a new player, Collateral Network, is making waves with its upcoming COLT presale. This article delves into the recent developments of these three projects, shedding light on their potential profitability and growth.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEthereum (ETH): A New Era of Tokenized Securities\n\nThe crypto giant, Ethereum, is on the news recently due to developments regarding tokenized security. This may give it an advantage over its competitor, Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been a hot topic in the crypto world. Known for its smart contract functionality, Ethereum has been instrumental in the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and the DeFi sector.\n\nRecently, Ethereum made headlines when a subsidiary of the Bank of China launched the first-ever tokenized security on the Ethereum blockchain. This marked a significant milestone for Ethereum, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize the financial sector.\n\nIn the past month, Ethereum developers have also been planning for the next hard fork, dubbed \u2018Dencun.\u2019 This upgrade is expected to bring about significant improvements to the Ethereum network, further solidifying its position in the crypto market.\n\nThe launch of the tokenized security and the upcoming hard fork align with the article\u2019s title, suggesting that Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake could indeed be more profitable than Bitcoin mining.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): Bracing for CPI Volatility\n\nThe largest crypto out there, Bitcoin, is facing news of mining that may affect the profitability of the coin.\n\nBitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, has had its fair share of ups and downs. Despite facing its first monthly drop of 2023, Bitcoin remains a strong contender in the crypto market.\n\nRecent developments have seen Bitcoin traders bracing for Consumer Price Index (CPI) volatility. This comes as Bitcoin faces numerous resistance levels. However, this volatility never came, and despite record-low inflation, Bitcoin didn\u2019t budge.\n\nThese developments indicate that Bitcoin mining could face challenges in terms of profitability, especially when compared to Ethereum.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT): A New Dawn in Crypto Lending\n\nCollateral Network, an Ethereum web3 peer-to-peer lending platform, is set to disrupt the lending industry. This innovative project allows users to unlock liquidity against physical assets on the blockchain, such as jewelry, watches, properties, vintage cars, and artwork.\n\nCollateral Network offers a wide range of benefits. For lenders, these include a weekly passive income, tangible assets as collateral, and security in case of loan default. For borrowers, Collateral Network offers fast turnaround, privacy, transparency, low cost, and borderless transactions.\n\nAdditionally, owners of the $COLT token will have access to our exclusive online auctions for distressed assets. These give investors the chance to buy properties below market value when a borrower defaults on a loan. Some of these auctions will also be in the metaverse.\n\nAnalysts predict a significant price surge for the COLT token. With an initial starting price of $0.001, the token will increase by 3500% during the presale, potentially reaching $0.35. Furthermore, the token will surge by 100x when it lists on major exchanges. Currently, the COLT token has increased its price up to $0.168.\n\nThese predictions, coupled with the platform\u2019s innovative approach to lending, suggest that Collateral Network could indeed be a game-changer in the crypto market.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Why Petronas should start mining Bitcoin - Free Malaysia Today",
        "content": "Petronas has a problem.\n\nIts CEO Tengku Muhammad Taufik didn\u2019t pull any punches when he said that Petronas\u2019 golden days of oil refining profits are over, saying its financial performance will fall short of last year\u2019s.\n\nIn addition to its projected profitability, Petronas also reported that it achieved a 10.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and an 18.7% reduction in flaring and venting emissions. This might sound good, but it is not nearly enough to meet its net zero goals.\n\nWhat if in one fell swoop, Petronas could boost profitability and drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions? Let\u2019s see how Petronas can achieve this.\n\nWhen a company drills for oil, it often doesn\u2019t just find an oil well that can be tapped into. There is usually an abundance of trapped natural gas that accompanies the oil. However, in most instances, it is not economical to capture this natural gas as, unlike oil, which can be packed in barrels and transported across the world, natural gas requires a pipeline.\n\nAnd since many oil wells are in remote locations or off-shore, especially Malaysia\u2019s, it makes little economic sense to build an infrastructure of pipelines to route this natural gas. So to get rid of this natural gas (which if unvented, could result in explosions due to the high pressure it exerts), most oil wells flare it, meaning they burn it off. This is an obscene waste of natural resources.\n\nHere\u2019s a highly combustible, energy-rich stream of gas that could power the homes and lives of millions. But instead of using it, oil companies around the world are burning it off. They burn it instead of letting it vent as natural gas is methane-rich, a greenhouse gas 80 times more detrimental to the environment than carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame.\n\nThe World Bank, which thinks this problem is acute, estimates that the roughly 10,000 gas flares around the world can power all of sub-Saharan Africa. To mitigate this, it has started a Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative to end all flaring activities by 2030.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s realistically no way this is going to happen with how things are progressing now, as the chart below illustrates:\n\nAs can be seen, even as flaring intensity has decoupled very slightly from oil production, we\u2019re nowhere near close to ending flaring, and especially not before 2030.\n\nAnd Malaysia is one of the largest contributors to this flaring, as can be seen from the chart below from The World Bank:\n\nBut what if there was now a way to put all this wasted natural gas to good use? What if we could end flaring once and for all while creating economic value?\n\nEnter Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol uses energy to create monetary value. It is energy agnostic, meaning it is happy to gobble up any and all types of energy, irrespective of its origin and source. And most importantly, the machines needed for Bitcoin mining are modular, mobile, can be scaled up and down depending on need and can be placed right at the source of the energy.\n\nIn a nutshell, Bitcoin mining is a fantastic solution to the problem of gas flaring. Instead of wasting the gas by just venting or flaring it, it can be fed into a generator and used to power Bitcoin mining rigs, which will convert it into Bitcoin. And with one Bitcoin worth around RM120,000, this is a lucrative activity.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a novel idea.\n\nBrent Whitehead and Matt Lohstroh, two Texas collegemates, were so gripped by the potential of Bitcoin to solve the problem of flared gas that they created a company called Giga Energy to address it.\n\nGiga does exactly what this article outlines \u2013 it places a shipping container full of thousands of Bitcoin miners on an oil well and routes the natural gas into generators that convert the gas into electricity to power the miners.\n\nAccording to Denver-based Crusoe Energy Systems, this process reduces carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions by a huge 63% compared with flaring. Additionally, Bitcoin mining is a boost to the bottom line of the company\n\nIn 2021 alone, Giga Energy, still a startup in its infancy, made US$4 million, thanks to striking deals with more than 20 oil and gas companies to supply them with Bitcoin mining rigs to solve their gas flaring problem. Thanks to its continued success and traction, it raised a US$10 million Series A funding round just a few months ago.\n\nIt\u2019s just a matter of time before many oil and gas companies wake up to the fact that Bitcoin mining is great for the environment, their ESG rating and their bottom line. So, Petronas has the opportunity to be a pioneer in the industry in the region if it starts now, and not wait to follow others.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping that Petronas has the foresight and fortitude to strike a bold new path for itself.\n\nThe writer can be contacted at [email protected].\n\nStay current - Follow FMT on WhatsApp, Google news and Telegram WhatsApp Google News Telegram\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of FMT."
