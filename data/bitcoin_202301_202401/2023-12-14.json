        "content": "While many investors have rejoiced at Bitcoin\u2019s recent price upswings, others are betting that crypto\u2019s second fiddle, Ether, will actually be the big winner of 2024.\n\nWhile loud voices on Crypto Twitter have predicted the start of another bull run with Bitcoin\u2019s recent resurgence, JPMorgan analysts just wrote in a new report that the coin is overbought.\n\nThe report took aim at one of the biggest drivers of Bitcoin\u2019s recent rosy performance: the possibility that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve several spot Bitcoin ETFs in early January.\n\nSome have predicted that the approval of spot ETFs from TradFi firms like BlackRock and Fidelity will drive billions of dollars of inflows to Bitcoin, but JPMorgan said this optimism is misplaced.\n\nThe bank pointed to weak demand for existing spot Bitcoin ETFs in Europe and Canada as evidence that the investment vehicle could fail to garner significant traction in the U.S. Instead of bringing in fresh capital, spot ETFs are likely to instead draw from capital already invested in Bitcoin-backed vehicles such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Bitcoin futures ETFs, or Bitcoin mining companies.\n\nIf the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin fund, in particular, is allowed to become a spot ETF, existing investors could take profits and remove as much as $2.7 billion from the exchange-traded fund. That could severely dent prices, the report said.\n\n\u2018Recapture market share\u2019\n\nThe report also claims that the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which will cut the mining reward in half, has already been priced in and will not give the coin the boost some expect.\n\nOn the other hand, the JPMorgan report said Ether could outperform Bitcoin in 2024 owing in part to an upcoming upgrade to the underlying Ethereum blockchain dubbed EIP-4844 or proto-danksharding. The update is meant to increase throughput and decrease gas fees charged to those who execute transactions on the network.\n\n\u201cWe believe that next year Ethereum will reassert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nAs crypto prices have fallen over the past several months, funding dollars have dried up, and some VCs have cut the valuations of some of their biggest crypto bets by double digits. JPMorgan said it\u2019s seen a \u201creinvigoration\u201d of VC funding this quarter, although it still looks preliminary.\n\nStill, analysts think a revival in venture capital activity in the crypto industry could make a meaningful difference. \u201cTo the extent this improvement continues into the first quarter of 2024,\u201d the report continued, \u201cthat would represent a significant development that would herald in our opinion the end of the Crypto Winter.\u201d"

        "title": "The Pros and Cons of Accepting Cryptocurrency as Payment - CO\u2014 by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce",
        "content": "If you\u2019re considering accepting cryptocurrency at your venture, it's important to know the benefits and disadvantages to offering this payment option. \u2014 Getty Images/ svetikd\n\nEl Salvador made headlines in September 2021 as the first country to accept bitcoin as its official legal tender. The announcement is a new milestone in the widespread adoption of cryptocurrency.\n\nSince then, however, the results have been mixed. On one hand, the IMF noted that risks related to the experiment have not been realized. On the other hand, the adoption of bitcoin by the Salvadoran population remains low\u2014and the country has lost around $60 million, according to CNBC.\n\nThese results suggest that cryptocurrency is still struggling to become mainstream. While more people are familiar with the concept of cryptocurrency, only a small number of customers feel confident using bitcoin and its counterparts for daily expenses. If you\u2019re considering accepting cryptocurrency at your venture, here are some benefits and disadvantages to offering this payment option.\n\n[Read more: How to Accept Bitcoin Payments]\n\nCryptocurrency offers better payment security\n\nThe pandemic led to a surge in credit card fraud, and since then, that type of fraud has continued to rise. Credit card fraud was the most common type of identity theft in 2022. And, unfortunately, small businesses are often the target of payment fraud and data breaches.\n\nCryptocurrency is considered more secure than credit and debit card payments. This is because cryptocurrencies do not need third-party verification. When a customer pays with cryptocurrency, their data isn\u2019t stored in a centralized hub where data breaches commonly occur. Rather, their information is stored in their crypto wallet. Plus, the blockchain general ledger is used to verify and record every transaction, making it very difficult, if not impossible, to steal someone\u2019s identity.\n\n[Read more: What Small Businesses Need to Know About Blockchain]\n\nCryptocurrency transactions are irreversible\n\nOnce a cryptocurrency payment goes through, it is permanent. This can be a double-edged sword for small businesses. \u201cTransactions can be refunded only by the party receiving the funds. Businesses that accept Bitcoin should be prepared for the possibility of customers requesting refunds, and keep track of how much money each customer has paid,\u201d wrote Inc.\n\nOn one hand, cryptocurrency\u2019s irreversibility helps business owners better manage their cash flow. There are no chargebacks to worry about, and if someone requires a refund, the retailer has to manually pay them back. This forces your team to keep immaculate records.\n\nHowever, this process can also create inefficiency in your business operations and lots of additional work for your employees. If you have a ton of refunds during the holiday season, for instance, your team will need to divert time and attention toward returning payments individually.\n\nYou may consider accepting cryptocurrency for items over a certain dollar value, rather than for daily sales.\n\nPay lower fees\n\nMerchants are responsible for paying transaction fees, as well as setup fees for many payment processors. PayPal, for instance, charges close to 4% per transaction (and sometimes more). Cryptocurrencies charge much lower fees, if any. Some bitcoin exchanges offer fees under 1%.\n\nLikewise, if your business serves customers overseas, cryptocurrencies can help avoid international currency payment fees. This is because cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t tied to a country of origin or national bank. As a result, businesses don\u2019t wait for payments to clear a foreign bank or pay the costs.\n\nThere are tax implications\n\nThe IRS considers cryptocurrency to be \u201cproperty\u201d for tax purposes. This means that if you accept cryptocurrency, you must report it as gross income based on its fair market value when it was received. \u201cIn other words, each time you sell, buy, or use Bitcoin, you're subject to a capital gains tax,\u201d wrote Inc.\n\nThe IRS rules for accepting cryptocurrency also mean that you must keep track of the value for each cryptocurrency on the day it was received and the day it was sold. This can quickly get complicated, especially when you\u2019re managing several transactions a day. You may consider accepting cryptocurrency for items over a certain dollar value, rather than for daily sales.\n\nIt\u2019s still considered extremely risky\n\nCrypto fans appreciate that this currency is considered immune from inflation. Governments can\u2019t manipulate the value of cryptocurrencies, which is both a risk and a benefit. On one hand, cryptocurrencies are a hedge against monetary inflation. On the other hand, the value of bitcoin and other crypto is extremely volatile. In a three-month span, the volatility of bitcoin reached nearly 8%. For many business owners, that level of unpredictability makes cryptocurrency simply untenable.\n\nCO\u2014 aims to bring you inspiration from leading respected experts.

Anticipation is building before a Jan. 10 deadline to approve or deny ARK/21Shares' spot bitcoin ETF application, and the price of bitcoin has more than doubled this year in anticipation of a vote.\n\nETF issuers and cryptocurrency firms have been filing to launch a spot bitcoin ETF for years, but the Securities and Exchange Commission has denied applications on the grounds of preventing market manipulation and protecting investors.\n\nYet after Grayscale Investments won a watershed lawsuit against the agency in late August, the SEC begun to meet with some prospective issuers to move their applications along and amend the filings to the SEC\u2019s liking. Firms such as Grayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity Investments have been meeting with the SEC in recent weeks, according to memos.\n\nThe ETF and crypto ecosystems are \u201cready\u201d to embrace a spot bitcoin ETF, according to Peirce. \u201cWe have experience with foreign jurisdictions having experience with products that are not spot, but futures products,\u201d she said.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Race\n\nPeirce, who was appointed to the SEC in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, has iterated her stance on cryptocurrency before, making her an outlier among SEC officials.\n\n\u201cWhat I do think the SEC needs to change is its attitude towards all things crypto and blockchain,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt has gotten to be a little ridiculous that we take a position that the moment something involves crypto, we start applying standards that are different,\u201d she said of the ETF approval process.\n\nStory continues\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler has expressed trepidation, if not hostility, toward cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need more digital currency\u2026we already have digital currency; it\u2019s called the U.S. dollar,\u201d he said in June.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

The currency now sits at $2,270. But its gains have lagged behind bitcoin, which has rocketed by around 154%.\n\nThe rally has largely been buttressed by optimism that a spot bitcoin ETF will get regulatory approval soon. But JPMorgan analysts are more skeptical about the bullish bets on bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto optimists believe a spot ETF approval would improve liquidity and lower the barrier of entry for more investors to invest in bitcoin without owning the currency. JPMorgan, however, thinks it's not so much new capital that would flow into the crypto as much as it is re-shuffled money from other crypto assets.\n\nAlso fueling the hype in bitcoin is the halving event scheduled for April next year, which tends to reduce the supply of the currency and lift prices. But the more bearish take by JPMorgan analysts is that the quadrennial event has been \"well factored\" into the current price, and the currency won't rally post-halving.\n\n\"We instead look for around 20% drop in the hash rate post halving as miners in higher cost locations or with less efficient hardware would be forced to exit the market,\" they wrote. \"This scenario would be more consistent with around $35k bitcoin price post halving.\""

(Most recently, Pando joined the race, marking 13 proposals for the SEC to field.)\n\nBut in discussing the filings, he alluded to the SEC\u2019s history of denials of these types of proposals.\n\n\u201cWe had in the past denied a number of these applications, but the courts here in the District of Columbia weighed in on that. And so we\u2019re taking a new look at this based upon those court rulings,\u201d Gensler said.\n\nRead more: Spot bitcoin ETF market sees new applicant ahead of SEC ruling\n\nWhen asked if he was directly alluding to the Grayscale ruling, Gensler skirted the answer and said that the SEC does everything \u201cwithin the laws Congress has passed and how the courts interpret them.\u201d\n\nWhile the SEC has open cases against Binance and Coinbase, it seems that he was alluding to Grayscale. Earlier this year, Grayscale notched a win against the regulatory agency after a panel of judges sided with the crypto-focused asset manager and ordered the SEC to take another look at its application to convert its bitcoin trust (GBTC) to an ETF.\n\nThe regulator had the option to appeal the decision earlier this year, but opted not to.\n\nThe SEC then took the application back under review, and since then it\u2019s held talks with the asset manager, according to Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas.\n\nRead more: Lucky 13?

Even traditional asset managers like BlackRock have tossed its hat in the ring, hoping to be one of the first.\n\nAt this point, there\u2019s a lot of optimism around the ETF decision, with Seyffart narrowing down a timetable for a potential decision. The SEC has until January 10 to make a decision on Ark and 21Shares\u2019 proposal, meaning that the window is centered around the days leading up.\n\nAs for the hope, Bloomberg analysts peg the chances of an approval by the January date to sit around 90%.

        "title": "Accounting change makes it easier for companies to hold Bitcoin\u2014but will any do so? - Fortune",
        "content": "One of the fun parts of reporting on finance is that the subject is so broad and full of wonky niches that there is always something new to learn. Recently, this has included the process for \u201cuplisting\u201d a stock, which I wrote about last month, and this month it meant looking under the hood of corporate treasuries. As it turns out, treasury management is about much more than just keeping track of a company\u2019s incoming cash and paying the bills\u2014that\u2019s the accountant\u2019s job\u2014and instead involves strategic decisions about how to optimize the use of cash through short- and longer-term investments. Fortune 500\u2013style companies typically employ entire teams who do nothing but that. Which brings us to Bitcoin.\n\nRight now, there are only a handful of companies that include Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries alongside T-bills, commercial paper, foreign exchange, and whatever else. One reason for this is that right now crypto, from an accounting perspective, is poison on the balance sheet since firms can record losses but not gains. In practice, this means that if a company bought Bitcoin at $20,000 and it dropped to $15,000, it must announce an impairment\u2014a nasty sounding word\u2014that never goes away, even if Bitcoin shoots up to $50,000 the same year. Even if holding Bitcoin actually increases a firm\u2019s wealth, the PR and financial headaches that go with impairments mean it\u2019s likely not worth it.\n\nAll of this is about to change, though, since the body that sets standards for the accounting profession just updated the rules for crypto so that, as of next December, firms can mark Bitcoin gains on their balance sheet. If current crypto prices hold up, this is going to deliver a windfall to Tesla, Block, and the tiny number of firms that have been unafraid to hold Bitcoin. The question now is whether the new accounting rule will lead other big companies\u2014maybe from the finance or tech industry\u2014to put some of their treasury holdings into crypto.\n\nThere are reasons to be skeptical. In an insightful thread, accountant and former hedge fund guy James Lavish noted that, even if the accounting concern is no longer an issue, Bitcoin still remains very volatile, so most CEOs will stay away for fear of telling their shareholders the company\u2019s crypto holdings are down 30% (even if they double in value the next year). The only CEOs to buck this trend are founding executives who hold large blocks of shares, which makes them unafraid to make unconventional decisions\u2014as Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk and Block\u2019s Jack Dorsey did with their Bitcoin bets (which have paid off handsomely, by the way).\n\nThis perspective makes it hard to share the rah-rah enthusiasm of Michael Saylor, cofounder of MicroStrategy, whose corporate treasury of 174,500 Bitcoins makes it by far the biggest public company that holds crypto. Saylor\u2014whose social media profile is awash in bling and laser eyes\u2014on Wednesday predicted the new accounting ruling will \u201cfacilitate the adoption of $BTC as a treasury reserve asset by corporations worldwide.\u201d\n\nThat sounds overly optimistic, but at the same time, the accountant Lavish says we are likely to see the emergence of more top executives who like the idea of adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. That doesn\u2019t sound far-fetched\u2014and if even another 5% of big companies embrace Bitcoin, that would be a major validation of crypto. We will likely find out a year from now.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nWorldcoin has expanded its authentication program\u2014which has three tiers, with the iris-scanning orb at the top\u2014to more platforms, including Reddit and Shopify.

        "title": "Better Bitcoin Stock: MicroStrategy vs. Riot Platforms - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "bitcoin-tokens\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) represent two different ways to invest in Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) rally of about 150% this year. MicroStrategy is a software company that started hoarding Bitcoin over the past three years. Riot is a leading Bitcoin mining company that mines BTC with its massive fleet of high-end miners.\n\nBoth stocks have skyrocketed this year, along with Bitcoin's price. MicroStrategy's stock has risen more than 290% this year, while Riot's stock has rallied more than 310%. Should investors chase either of these high-flying Bitcoin-related stocks right now?\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMicroStrategy operates two different businesses\n\nAt its core, MicroStrategy is an aging data mining and analytics company founded 34 years ago. It's expanded its ecosystem with more mobile and cloud services over the past two decades, but it's been struggling to keep pace with higher-growth cloud giants like Salesforce, Microsoft, and Amazon in the rapidly evolving market. That's why MicroStrategy's revenue grew at an anemic compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of less than 1% from 2010 to 2020.\n\nBut in August 2020, MicroStrategy's co-founder and then-CEO Michael Saylor drove the company to start spending the software segment's cash on big Bitcoin purchases. Its BTC holdings have risen from $250 million in its first big purchase to $4.7 billion in its latest quarter. That's more than 40% of MicroStrategy's current enterprise value of $9.4 billion.\n\nMicroStrategy currently holds 158,400 BTC on its balance sheet at an average purchase price of $29,586 -- so its investment is back in the black as of this writing. However, its rising BTC impairment charges also caused it to stay unprofitable over the past three years, while its issuing of fresh debt to fund its BTC purchases boosted its debt-to-equity ratio to 3.0. On the bright side, it's expected to return to profitability this year as it books lower impairment charges.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut as investors focus on its BTC investments, its core software business remains sluggish. Its total revenue only rose 1% year over year in the first nine months of 2023 as rising subscription revenue finally offset its declining product license and support revenues. Analysts expect its revenue to rise a mere 1% for the full year.\n\nThe bulls argue that MicroStrategy's enterprise value will eventually soar as it continues to buy BTC and stabilize its software business. However, a lot of growth could already be baked into its stock at 21 times next year's sales.\n\nRiot is a more straightforward Bitcoin play\n\nRiot was once a tiny patent holding company known as Bioptix, but it ditched its original business model and transformed into a dedicated BTC miner in 2017. It then purchased tens of thousands of top-tier Antminers from Bitmain.\n\nRiot had deployed a massive fleet of 112,944 miners by the end of November, which enables it to produce an average of 18.4 BTC every day. It's been selling hundreds of Bitcoins each month to boost its liquidity, but it was still holding 7,358 BTC (with a market value of $306 million) on its balance sheet at the end of November.\n\nRiot's business model is simpler than MicroStrategy's, but its fate is tethered to BTC's market price and volatile energy prices. In 2022, its revenue rose 22% to $259 million -- but its net loss widened from $8 million to $510 million as BTC's price plunged and energy prices spiked. However, analysts expect its revenue to rise 14% to $294 million this year as it narrows its net loss to $201 million.\n\nIf Bitcoin's price continues to rise as inflation cools off, Riot's revenues and profits could soar. It also plans to keep selling its excess power back to the grid at spot prices to stabilize its long-term operating margins. Riot can keep selling its own BTC to boost its cash flows, and its low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.1 still gives it plenty of room to raise more cash. And with an enterprise value of $2.9 billion, Riot looks a lot cheaper than MicroStrategy at 6 times next year's sales.\n\nBetter buy: Riot Platforms\n\nI personally think it makes more sense to directly buy Bitcoin instead of investing in these two capital-intensive companies. But if I had to choose one, I'd pick Riot because its business model is more straightforward, its growth rates are more stable, its balance sheet is healthier, and its stock looks cheaper relative to its long-term growth potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MicroStrategy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MicroStrategy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and MicroStrategy wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Bitcoin's Price Briefly Tops $43K as Federal Reserve Signals Rate Cuts Next Year - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Bitcoin popped above 43,000 very briefly after the Federal Reserve held its benchmark, fed funds rate steady for the third consecutive time. Joining us now to discuss is new edge wealth senior portfolio strategist and Principal Ben Emmons. Welcome back, Ben. Good morning Lawrence. Good to be back. Glad to see you. So, uh you know, we, we had the fed, keep its rates steady. But the real excitement happened afterwards when Fed chair, Jerome Powell spoke to the press spoke to everybody gave out a statement. Let's let's go over that because that seemed to really change the tone if you will about how the fed or it sounds as if the Fed might be changing its approach with inflation. Uh go in a little bit on that there. Tell us a little bit more about what Powell said and why it matters. Yeah, it was, I think very historic Lawrence because, you know, two weeks ago, he was at the Spelman College doing the speech and he in that speech on the record pushed back on speculation of rate cuts, you know, simply saying like this is premature and we're still much in the, in the stage here thinking of sufficiently restrictive policy to get inflation under control. But that first part of, of restrictive policy remained a bit in the press conference too. But when he went on, he said that, you know, they basically were discussing rate cuts at the FO MC meeting. They were also discussing that they should cut well before the inflation reaches 2%. And they were growing more confident in that inflation is going to get to that target. And then last year, he said also that the fat sugar rates, otherwise they would be too late if they get, if they wait too long and inflation reaches closer to 2% and then the count rate, it would be too late. So that's what we would call a pivot. And then that's that you, if you first say that you're going to not cut rates and then you're saying you're openly discussing rate cuts and that was the major change. I think that is why markets reacted so strongly seeing yields declining sharply, dollar weaker equity markets up, commodity markets up. So this is a very classic historic moment for markets where FED chair says like we do X but we actually are discussing why and this is the pivot and it changes a bunch of things we're seeing. For instance, this idea that the, the Fed might have conquered inflation without causing a recession and that it's even looking as you mentioned before to cutting rates. It looks like it's gonna be probably three rate cuts, uh, at least 75 basis points. Correct. Yeah, it's at least 75. That's in the forecast. That was a change too because before in September they only a forecast of 50 basis points. And you're right, like the, the, the fed feels comfortable to say that they can cut rates because they're getting close to their objectives. You know, both employment and inflation moving in the trajectory that they are forecasting. And therefore this recession isn't happening really because they kept rates long enough restrictive that they can, they can now start lowering them again next year. Now, some of this has been out there before that the New York fed Williams started that discussion and uh fed Governor Waller came about later and really infused that buzz around his rate cut. But ultimately that the fed puts it back into the, into the top block with more rate cuts. And then talking about that, they're open to rate cuts in the discussion that gives the market a lot of fuel to pricing even more. I think what will happen now. And this was the other interesting question at the press conference is about, you know, we're in an election year, right? And cutting rates in election year may be politically sensitive. Of course, Paul said that we're gonna do what's, what's the writing for the economy? Uh They're getting a forecast, right? So they can cut rates but then you get this term called front loading. And one of the reporters asked him about that, he stayed politically neutral, but he didn't dismiss and didn't push back on that either. So the market is taking this as a cue to say, you're not only going to cut rates, but you may be front loading them too and, and by front loading them, you mean allowing it to kind of go into detail by what that, what that means and, and it's, and tie it in to the, the election and, and what Powell might be trying to do here potentially or the fed rather. Yeah, if you go back in time. So it's starting in March of 2022 when they did the first rate hike the following month, the the term front loading came really quickly that narrative because they recognized inflation was running away from them going up too quickly. And so they started ratcheting up the rate during that summer of 2022. And board was really out with that term. We have to front load policy. We have to hike more quicker, faster to get a restrictive rate and put pressure on inflation. Now, it's the opposite situation. And so if inflation is moving now faster than what they had anticipating, they have to do also this front loading of, of rate cuts because otherwise they may undershoot the inflation target. Ironically, after all the inflation that we have, we may not get a potential undershoot of the inflation target. And so in a political year, like next year, I think the two dynamics there, Lawrence one. Yeah, you do. What's right for the economy, right? Because if you get inflation, it gets too low, it cannot be a good thing either for the economy. So you cut rates. Secondly, it probably has something to do with the election if you're cutting right in front of the presidential election, that probably is not a very good thing to do. So that gives you some reason to do it sooner. So I think if you summarize it all together, you say front loading means in this context, they're gonna start lightly cutting rates by either in March or May and may do that with, with an increment of of 50 basis points instead of 25 and then maybe do it out of 20 or 25 in the summer. And that it means that front loading, the easing, meaning all those rates that they forecast are coming sooner in the year than, than rather than later. Well, you kind of answered the, the question I was going to ask you about, you know, before this recent move, Goldman Sachs said they were predicting two rate cuts for next year. Now this morning, we're hearing some analysts say uh three, where do you think we're going to land? Yeah. So the market is very extended now, right? And, and, and the economist jump on board with the market because they're looking at this and is getting off the message from power. So I think what I come down to is that the fed will probably meet at least three rate cuts that are priced in but potentially one more thereafter. Because back in June, in that forecast, they had 100 base points of cuts originally forecasted in, in their, in their outlook. I think that's where they ultimately land at 100 basis points. And I think this is probably, you know, also the, the the best middle of the road solution for this inflation rate as it starts declining, that they don't want this inflation rate to decline too fast and then they're too late. So I think 100 basis points is likely next year. So of course, our viewers are interested in crypto. How does let's tie this back into crypto because of course, Bitcoin is a risk on asset at least for now. Uh How do we, how should traders invest now in crypto? Should they invest? What, how, how should they approach crypto with this sort of pet fed pivot? Yeah, if you think of, of crypto and, and I'm gonna put a little bit maybe in the commodity space, all commodities are sensitive to interest rates, whether that's gold and metals or, or energy crypto is in that, in that similar sort of vein, it's very sensitive to interest rates and that has to do with just, I think money in itself, it also has to do with that. People connect Bitcoin with an alternative currency and that's always related to interest rates. So I think as rates go down, crypto prices go up as do gold prices go up as silver as it, as en energy going up as we speak. The other side of that, of course, is that you have the dollar which now start to weaken and if the fed does deliver 100 basis points of cuts, then the dollar will be weaker against most major currencies. And I think that too lifts crypto to a higher level. Lastly, I think it's also about financing in itself. So anything that you, you, you need to finance money with, you get a lower interest on that you can put into risky assets like crypto that will benefit that I think too that if you, you know the, the, the pending ETF for Bitcoin spot Bitcoin probably is boosted by this idea too, a lower rate environment is beneficial for a spot. Bitcoin ETF. I think so that I think all leads to this idea of that. Yeah, crypto reacts to interest rates quite sensitively and we could probably see, you know, maybe go back to 50 60,000 on Bitcoin. All right. And Ben, we can't stop talking about the spot, Bitcoin ETF here on the show and in the industry, uh JP Morgan recently said that if a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved, it's unlikely to spur major gains. That's, of course, the opposite of what a lot of the asset managers who have skin in the game are saying. And a lot of industry watchers. What do you think? Yeah, I think it's, it's coming, it's really, it's almost here if you will. Right. Like, there's been such a back and forth on between the SEC and, and the industry and the SEC is also recognizing that that Bitcoin and crypto is a real financial asset and people want to trade it, they want to transact in it, they want to use it, they want to have it as part of their portfolio. So it always has been about finding the right framework around an asset like crypto in order then to have ETF S based on Spot Bitcoin to really be available to the general public. So I think it's about here, there's some speculation when exactly I don't have insight on that. It's myself, but that it makes sense because we already seen, I believe spot Coin Bit Bitcoin, ETF S in Canada and have worked there to an extent that to that extent, it can work here too, it can work anywhere, right? It's just a matter of having the right framework of regulation around this, around Bitcoin, how it has to be, you know, operating just the same way as it would be for equity or bounty TF And I think this is where we, we're heading. So II I would say within the next year this, this Bitcoin ETF will be here. Do you think the price will rally on an approval or do you, do you think it's already priced in it? It could still rally more because once you have an actual ETF and the info start to come into that and we know that Bitcoin is a, is a basically a limited currency, right? It's limited supply. Yeah, then you're getting more buying. So it, it should drive up the price. How far? I don't know, but I definitely think it, it will underpin the price and it is therefore not fully priced. In. On the other hand, Bitcoin ETF will start trading kind of like a commodity ETF like I think of God as a gold ETF people buy it and trade it and go in and out. So you also get people who show it obviously and, and you get some flows. But I think initially to the to the run up of the actual launch, those those issuers think Blackrock think a lot of big issuers would have to accumulate Bitcoin in order to back it, right? So that's, I think why the price gets driven up. All right, Ben, we are going to have to leave it there. Thank you very much for joining us this morning. It's always a pleasure having you on the show. Thank you. It's great to be here. That was new edge wealth. Senior portfolio strategist and Principal Ben Emmons."

        "content": "Over the past six months, talks of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become increasingly prominent. With over a dozen applications filed from asset management companies such as BlackRock Inc. and Grayscale, the proposed ETFs are inching closer and closer to reality.\n\nWith talks becoming more serious, the price of Bitcoin has also been doing well. Bitcoin is approaching $40,000 for the first time since April 2022, and the hype around the token and ETFs is real.\n\nWhile there are already a handful of Bitcoin ETFs on the market, they use futures to track the price of Bitcoin. This results in high fees, as the manager has to continually roll over the contracts, and it means the ETF may not always track exactly with Bitcoin. The proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs attempt to solve these issues by owning Bitcoins and creating an ETF on that basis. While this may seem like a simple and demanded solution, there are some steep regulatory hurdles that the applicants must overcome.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAnalysts predict Bitcoin ETF approval by Jan. 10th. Prepare your BTC stack today .\n\nThis brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it ?\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare?\n\nDespite these challenges, firms are continuing to meet with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and JPMorgan predicts that some spot Bitcoin ETFs could go live as soon as early 2024. Because of this, many are beginning to look at the implications of a spot Bitcoin ETF on crypto.\n\neToro CEO Yoni Assia is one of those who wonders what a market with spot Bitcoin ETFs would look like.\n\nAssia pointed out that the ETFs have the potential to lead to large-scale adoption on an institutional level for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, he believes that many institutions \"work in a very rigid way.\" Because of this, they can be hesitant to invest in assets that they are not familiar with or are not readily available. \"[An] ETF, in many cases, is that infrastructure to enable institutional demand to those who don't want to self-custody,\" Assia said.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond, Assia believes that the increased availability of Bitcoin would lead to more trust on an institutional level. Without the ETF, investors must go to a crypto exchange, use a wallet and navigate a new way of investing. With the ETF, it becomes more accessible and could result in new investors and price increases.\n\nAssia also alluded to the impacts spot Bitcoin ETFs could have on retail investors. In his eyes, retail investing is \"all about the user experience, simplicity and the ability to embed crypto investments and crypto trading in a wider portfolio.\" These ETFs would make it easier for retail investors to incorporate Bitcoin into their portfolios and increase access.\n\nAssia, along with many others, sees spot Bitcoin ETFs as a net good for crypto. They believe that this could be a major step in the wide-scale adoption of the token.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nThis article Here's What eToro's CEO Says About Bitcoin ETFs originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Traditionally, the mining industry has been vilified for its environmental impact and energy use. This article describes the industry where mining can have an immediate positive impact \u2013 fossil fuel operations.\n\nBackground\n\nThe run-up to November 2023 COP28 in Dubai has seen a flurry of activity from the world\u2019s three largest economies on the question of energy sector methane. That month, China published its long-awaited Methane Emissions Control Action Plan, followed by the China-US Sunnylands Statement on Enhancing Cooperation to Address the Climate Crisis and the European Council and Parliament announcing a deal on new rules to cut methane emissions in the energy sector. Prolific emitters, like Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, added themselves to the 150 signatories of the Global Methane Pledge.\n\nThe momentum continued, with 50 oil and gas companies that represent 40% of global petroleum production signing the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter and committing to end methane emissions and routine gas flaring by 2030.\n\nFinally, the world is waking up to the fact that if we are to have any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by 2050, we must act decisively to stop the venting and flaring of methane from the global oil, gas, and coal industries.\n\nBut amongst the excitement, it is forgotten that reducing the flaring and venting of methane necessarily involves capturing and utilizing it. A question no one seems to be asking is what to do with all this methane.\n\nThe Bad And The Ugly Of Fossil Fuel Methane\n\nThe atmospheric methane emissions have tripled since the start of the industrial revolution, believed to be responsible for 0.5 degrees of the 1 degree warming we saw to date. The International Panel on Climate Change states that if we are to have any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by 2050, we must act decisively on methane.\n\nThe International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) Methane Tracker estimates that one-third of man-made methane emissions comes from the production, transportation, and use of fossil fuels. This totals around 120 million tonnes of methane annually, evenly split between the oil, gas, and coal industries. The impact is equivalent to 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide \u2013 more than the United States' and EU\u2019s CO2 emissions combined.\n\nThe IEA\u2019s Net Zero by 2050 roadmap states that in order to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, the energy sector must reduce its methane emissions by 75% by 2030, predominantly through the \u201cthe rapid deployment of measures and technologies to eliminate avoidable methane emissions by 2030.\u201d\n\nThe Methane Tracker shows that 75% of global fossil fuel methane emissions come from 10 regions:\n\nThe Potential Role Of Bitcoin Mining In Greenhouse Gas Reduction\n\nIn September 2022, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy published a report on Climate and Energy Implications of Crypto-Assets in the United States. One of the report\u2019s conclusions was that \u201ccrypto-asset mining operations that capture vented methane to produce electricity can yield positive results for the climate, by converting the potent methane to CO2 during combustion\u2026; could potentially be more reliable and more efficient at converting methane to CO2 [than flaring]... and \u2026is more likely to help rather than hinder U.S. climate objectives.\u201d\n\nThe IPCC estimates that over 20 years, a tonne of methane has a climate change impact equivalent to 80 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Hiveon, a top-rated suite of mining products, calculates that using otherwise vented methane to generate the electricity needed to produce one Bitcoin would lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 6\u2019000 tonnes of CO2, or the annual emissions of 1,400 passenger cars in the US.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge the crypto industry\u2019s carbon emissions, but also believe in its ability to act as an important tool in combatting climate change. That\u2019s why we launched Hiveon Energy, a project in the intersection of the blockchain field and traditional energy industries. It\u2019s our contribution to making mining more sustainable while also helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d \u2013 Andrii Garanin, VP of Hiveon Energy.\n\nJust 1MW of Bitcoin mining equipment could destroy over 800 tonnes of methane annually, providing greenhouse gas reductions equivalent to a typical 140 MW solar facility in the US. With just the global Bitcoin industry requiring 10-15 GW of power generation capacity, it has huge potential to reduce methane emissions.\n\nWhy Mining\n\nThe IEA estimates that it\u2019s possible to capture and use 75% of the methane vented from oil and gas production and about 50% from coal. Methane is a valuable commodity, but there is a reason why so much of it is vented rather than sold or utilized.\n\nThis is because the majority of vented energy sector methane is almost by definition stranded gas. Fossil fuel operators are profit-driven, so if they had a way to monetize the wasted methane, they would have used it.\n\nVented methane comes from regions like Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, the Middle East, Caspian, etc. These regions are already massive producers of fossil fuels, so they have few customers for natural gas. It needs to be transported to customers as LNG, through pipelines, or as electricity, which involves extensive investments in infrastructure, as well as substantial legal, regulatory, and commercial barriers.\n\nThese investments have long payback periods, making them challenging in the current context where the world needs to rapidly ramp down its production of fossil fuels.\n\nThe mining industry can act as a global buyer of stranded natural gas. Miners require no access to the grid or power markets \u2013 just the gas supply, a plot of land, and an internet connection.\n\nMost importantly, because such projects can use modular, mobile solutions, the equipment can be moved easily and cheaply in case of localized issues around gas supply or power demand.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nUndeniably, the global crypto industry is a large consumer of electricity, part of which comes from the burning of fossil fuels. But it\u2019s also a major potential customer for otherwise vented methane, providing an enormous opportunity to reduce methane emissions globally.\n\nThe major barrier is a lack of knowledge from global policymakers and the mining industry about the workings of such an enterprise. Despite the challenges, we need policies that will promote the use of vented gas, or at least not hinder it by regulations such as blanket bans on mining.\n\nAs stated by Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, \u201cThe world will break down if we don\u2019t fix the energies we use today. The world will break down if we don\u2019t mitigate the emissions on a gigaton scale.\u201d\n\nThis is a guest post by Andrii Garanin.

        "title": "Bitcoin's Price Set to End the Week Relatively Unchanged - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Bitcoin is, it's gonna end this week about 2% lower. Uh You know, that's not considered that much in crypto, of course, but here we are, we're looking at us Federal Reserve keeping its benchmark fed funds rate, uh staying the range relatively steady uh that they announced on Wednesday. Joining us now to discuss the crypto markets is Oanda senior market analyst, Craig Earlham. Welcome Craig. Thanks for having me. I'm glad to see you here. So of course, uh we, we're seeing not just the Federal Reserve keep rate steady, also the Bank of England, ECB European Central Bank. Um What, what do you make of all of that and what it tells us not only about uh the future of inflation and fighting inflation, but also what it means for risk, assets, particularly crypto. So it was interesting. The fed got us off to a fantastic start from a brisk asset perspective. They, they came out on Wednesday, they held we rate steady. That's almost irrelevant at this point because all anyone is interested in is what's to come next rather than what's happening now. No one expected a rate cut or a rate hike at either of these meetings. Uh, it's about what's coming next. Uh, and the markets at the time were pricing in four or five rate cuts next year. And the, the, the talk on the street was, are we being too bullish here? Are we being too aggressive? Is this too much optimism? Are we doing that usual thing where we get ahead of ourselves? Any reason, any justification to, to, to kind of buy stocks, to buy risk assets, to buy Bitcoin. Uh And uh those questions were being asked in the last week or so. And then the fed came out and rather than come out and say, well, we'll see what happens or play the kind of steady as she goes cards, they came out three rate cuts next year is what we're looking at and the markets exploded, we saw uh risk assets performing really well. Uh And then markets did what they do best. They decided to push it further. So they started pricing in six rate cuts next year. Uh and the, the other central banks or the markets, uh looking at other central banks followed suit. And I think they put other central banks, namely the Bank of England and the ECB in a difficult position because suddenly if they come out and do something similar to the fed, the markets can just get carried away again. So rather than get the Dovish message that we got from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, we got a more steady message from the Bank of England. We didn't have to get too much from them. Uh, no new forecast, no press conference. So the, the pressure wasn't really on and then we got a bit of a hawkish pushback from Christine Lagarde and the ECB. And what did Marcus do? They completely ignored her. Uh, and they continued to price in six rates from the bank from the European Central Bank next. Yeah, it really has been quite a fascinating week and, uh, kind of settles up now for the end of the year in 2024 but perhaps not on the back of all of that because like I say, it's been uh an exhausting week. Um, on the back of all that, I'm not surprised to see maybe some more subdued trading today because a, I think everyone's exhausted. Maybe some people at Christmas parties last night. And I think also, uh, we've had a lot of information to take on board and it's been quite an interesting couple of weeks all in all. I, when I look at the price of Bitcoin though, over the past couple of weeks, we, we saw a peak up to 45 and then sell off. And some people attributed to, uh at least the run up to both the idea that the fed will take a more Dovish stance and also the idea of an ETF coming to market sometime soon. Yet we have this sell off since 45 we're now down to 42 and change. Uh I, I, is I, is that the correct assessment that these macroeconomic aspects, uh, to Bitcoin's trading had such an effect as to bring down the price or move the price where it is? It doesn't seem to quite make sense and, or, and, and are people perhaps overplay or overestimating the role of an ETF? In other words, are there any other factors besides either the ETF or the uh interest rate situation that could have moved Bitcoin's price to where it is currently? I think that's a really good question. Um I mean, I always say with uh with things like this is there's primary drivers and then the supporting factors and uh when there's not a lot going on in uh especially a kind of the headline uh arena uh in the, in the crypto world, then people can focus a lot more on what's happening with interest rates and risk appetites, especially over the last uh couple of years. But I think that's been more of a supportive factor at this point because I do think the ETF is a, is a massive driver. It's taking a long time. But I do think it's the the dominant driver of why there's a lot more optimism in uh the crypto space. Uh whether it's gonna be the game changer, we all want it to be. I, I'm, I'm not so sure it, it's helpful. It's a step in the right direction uh as the futures contract was before that and so on and so forth. Um And if I remember rightly, the run up to the futures launch and the, the, the, the uh the, the approval of that, we, we saw a lot, uh we saw strong rallies, we saw a lot of optimism, but the moment it was announced, we very much so by the rumor seller fact scenario, there's every chance that we get the similar thing with the ETF, we've seen a lot of optimism, really strong run up to that, perhaps we'll get something similar. Um And I think as, as Bitcoin and uh other cryptos become more mature, I do think this kind of trading is normal. If you look at any other asset class, things don't move in a straight line, we can rally 10% we can fall 5% we can rally another 10%. We can fall five percent that there's, there's nothing unusual about that and I don't see anything unusual about what we're seeing in, in Bitcoin right now. I just see a lot of euphoria uh over the ETF contract and then we'll move on to the next thing after that, when that ultimately uh is approved and I do think it will be approved. I think it always helps when we're in an environment where people want to take more risk. Um like it or loathe it. Bitcoin is a risky asset. Uh, I don't think anyone, um, should be in any two minds about that. Well, at least as far as I'm concerned anyway, but there's nothing wrong with that. There's lots of risky assets out there. Uh, and when risk assets are performing well, it's not surprising to see Bitcoin performing well. Uh, at the same time we need risk appetite to be strong. And an environment where we're looking at interest rates falling in quite aggressively over the next couple of years is more beneficial for uh risky assets because people's risk, appetite improves in a way that in the last 18 months, interest rates rising and no one knowing how far naturally undermines risk. There's a reason why the dow this week hit a new all time high for the first time in two years. Craig tell us a little bit more about that. How will monetary policy continue to impact the crypto markets as we move into 2024? Well, I think one of the most overused phrases is uh markets hate uncertainty, but it's, it's so true. So it doesn't matter how many times you hear it, it doesn't make it less relevant. And one thing that we've had over the last two years is enormous uncertainty. We've had uncertainty over inflation. We've had uncertainty over the aftermath of the pandemic, uncertainty over interest rates, the water in you, Ukraine uh energy prices. Uh There's been uncertainty around every corner and the markets don't like that. We're see, we're moving into an environment which looks more clear cut. Now we're moving into an environment with low where we could potentially see low and steady inflation into an environment where interest rates are falling rather than rising. And we don't know where to that is all much better uh if you're an investor because you know what you're effectively benchmarking against, you know what uh what the situation is like, you, you know what the economic prospects are because again, rising interest rates is not just bad for investors, it's not just bad for markets, but it's bad for business. It's bad for the economy. Uh So you don't know how far things are gonna have to be pushed and how far we're gonna have to tip into recession or, or something much worse. Now, it looks as though we're achieving a soft landing, which is borderline, miraculous considering how aggressively interest rates have risen and we're facing interest rate, uh cuts going into 2024 things will look a lot more promising now. Uh And therefore investors may be willing to take a little bit more risk in a way that they were two years ago. But for the last uh for the last 24 months have been less inclined to do so, maybe the last six months or so, a little bit more more. So I think the, the kind of all the A I uh uh euphoria earlier this year really did help things uh uh kind of risk, have to take it back on its feet. Uh But it's taken a bit more time over the course of the year to really catch up. But uh I think we are now going into a more stable environment and investors like stability with that. Oh, well, I actually with, with that stability. Do you see any interest uh going into alt coins as well as, as a, as a way to get a little bit more yield, people looking there or have people sort of cooled off a little bit on the alt, we, we saw a little bit of a run up uh before, but when I talk to traders, they say there's something weird about it. Yeah, I mean, I think, well, the, the thing we have, right is that uh I think investors know that there's uh Bitcoin has been around Bitcoin has more of a track record now. Um all coins, uh you can imagine people have been burned during bear markets and quite aggressive bear markets. Bitcoin fell what 75% from its uh from its all time high. Uh I in the last couple of years and is now bouncing back strongly, but people got really burned by all coins and it takes some time to uh to kind of repair the damage. But the more that we see Bitcoin gain, the higher the price that we see for Bitcoin, the more people's attention is naturally gonna be turned to all coins because there's gonna be a lot more focus then on if Bitcoin's up 50% in X amount a month, then this coin is up 100% this coins up 500% and interest, uh, interest starts to appear back in the old coin market. I do think we will see more and more interest in the old coin market going into 2024 if we get that ETF approved. Uh uh and if Bitcoin continues to perform well, if Bitcoin hits a new all time high, I have no doubt interest will return to the old coin market. It's uh uh but if we, again, I think in that scenario, we need, we need uh an increasingly stable environment and uh and, and if we continue to see our next, but we will then, but then in my view, at least, I think we will see more interest in the old coin market, no doubt. All right, Craig, we're gonna have to leave it there. Lawrence saved you from my predictions question. You ask, you know what three years predictions for 2024 who want to do it? I'm asking it for you. What are your predictions for? 2024? Wow. Uh, a nice easy question, uh my predictions for 2024. Um I mean, I, I hate to say the obvious thing. II, I think interest rates will come down. I think we will. Uh I, I do think central banks will be a lot more active in that direction. I think uh um uh I mean, I haven't really given this question that we thought of the second. Uh But yeah, I, I think we think we will see a more stable environment. I do think we'll see more risk appetite. Uh And I think we'll, I think that will benefit ri risk, risk assets ultimately. Uh So that's my prediction very much off the top of my head. Uh But uh yeah, iii I do think we're gonna, I think we're going for, I think we're 2024 is gonna be the uh a very good year. Shall we put it that way? Price me Bitcoin next year, 11 year from now. Where is it gonna be? I mean, honestly, give me a dart and a dartboard and I'll happily throw it. But I I it could be anything from 100,000 to 10,000. Honestly, it's uh pricing Bitcoin a year from now is, uh, is an impossible task and it always has been like, that's not just now pick a price and it'll be there, get there eventually. All right, Craig, we're going to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining us this morning and we hope you have a happy New Year. Thank you. You too. That was Oanda senior market analyst.

        "title": "$100K BTC? Don't undervalue Bitcoin ETF influence, says Adam Back - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic, rampant inflation and regional conflicts directly influenced Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) drop in value over the past two years. However, 2024 promises to be a resurgent period, according to Blockstream CEO Adam Back.\n\nThe cryptographer, who pioneered the proof-of-work algorithm applied in Bitcoin\u2019s protocol, tells Cointelegraph that the preeminent cryptocurrency is trailing below the historical price trend line of previous mining reward halving events.\n\n\u201cBiblical\u201d events hurt Bitcoin\n\nBack weighed in on the potential price action of Bitcoin as the next halving approaches, which will see Bitcoin miners\u2019 block reward reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Block reward halvings are programmatically hardwired into Bitcoin\u2019s code, taking place after every 210,000 blocks.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s supply issuance is hardwired into its protocol, with BTC mining rewards halving every 210,000 blocks. Source: bitcoinblockhalf.com\n\nBack says that the overlaid averages of the previous market cycles and halvings indicate that Bitcoin\u2019s relative value is trailing behind widely accepted projections. Multiple events have played a role in driving the price of BTC down, which has also been seen across traditional financial markets:\n\n\u201cThe last few years were like biblical pestilence and plague. There was COVID-19, quantitative easing and wars affecting power prices. Inflation running up people, companies are going bankrupt.\u201d\n\nThe impact has keenly affected markets and portfolio management, according to Back. Investment managers have had to manage risk and losses over the past few years, which has necessitated the sale of more liquid assets.\n\n\u201cThey have to come up with cash, and sometimes they\u2019ll sell the good stuff because it\u2019s liquid and Bitcoin is super liquid. It used to happen with gold, and I think that\u2019s a factor for Bitcoin in the last couple of years,\u201d Back explains.\n\nBitcoin would have hit $100,000 already\n\nAs 2023 comes to a close, many of these macro events that Back cited have wound down, while more industry-specific failures have also been resolved. This has been reflected in Bitcoin\u2019s recent price surge from Nov. 2023 onwards.\n\n\u201cThe wave of the contagion, the companies that went bankrupt because they were exposed to Three Arrows Capital, Celsius, BlockFi and FTX \u2014 that\u2019s mostly done. We don\u2019t think there are many more big surprises in store,\u201d Back said.\n\nRelated: Blockstream targets continued Bitcoin miner surplus with Series 2 BASIC Note\n\nThe Blockstream CEO previously predicted that Bitcoin would hit $100,000 in the next market cycle and referred back to this point. He believes BTC would have hit this mark already if not for the macro factors highlighted before.\n\nBack also referred to the Bitcoin \u201cstock-to-flow\u201d model created by pseudonymous former institutional investor PlanB as a reference point for the potential upside for Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nIf you want to know more about bitcoin Stock-to-Flow:\n\n* This is the original 2019 article:https://t.co/n5P5uMCKHT\n\n* Or watch this YouTube video:https://t.co/3SGMU1Ln00 pic.twitter.com/Qp8SjqtXIB \u2014 PlanB (@100trillionUSD) December 5, 2023\n\nBack explains that PlanB\u2019s model and heuristics suggest that savvy Bitcoin investors historically bought BTC six months before a halving event and sold into significant surges in price that have occurred in the 18 months following the drop in mining rewards:\n\n\u201cPeople thought it was a bit of a crazy assertion that we might get to $100,000 pre-halving because I said it when the price was around $20,000.\u201d\n\nHe adds that Bitcoin\u2019s price hitting $44,000 multiple times in Dec. 2023 suggests that his prior prediction might not be so far-fetched.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF effect\n\nProminent investors and market analysts have also highlighted the effect of the potential approval of several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nPeople asking me if we changed odds. No, we still holding line at 90% odds of approval by Jan 10 (aka this cycle), the same odds we've had for months (before it was cool/safe). What we watching for now: more amended/final filings to roll in and clarity on in-kind vs cash creates https://t.co/uiWgfxOfzz \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 29, 2023\n\nSenior ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have touted these applications to get the green light in early 2024. Galaxy Digital\u2019s co-founder Michael Novogratz has also predicted mass inflows of institutional investment into the BTC-backed products, a point echoed by Back:\n\n\u201cI think Bitcoin could get to $100,000 even before the ETF and before the halving. But I certainly think the ETF shouldn\u2019t be undervalued in its influence.\u201d\n\nA key reason cited by the Bitcoin advocate is that whole segments of traditional markets, including major fund managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, are simply not allowed to invest directly into assets like Bitcoin.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs will drive institutional adoption in 2024 \u2014 Galaxy Digital\u2019s Mike Novogratz\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re managing a mutual fund, they have rules, either externally imposed or as part of their fund, that they can only buy things like public stocks and ETFs. They can\u2019t buy into startups, they can\u2019t buy precious metals physically. They can\u2019t do any of that stuff,\u201d Back said.\n\nThis remains a pertinent reason why a spot Bitcoin ETF could drive significant capital inflows into the space. Back adds that the investment vehicle opens access to Bitcoin exposure for many types of funds, particularly in the U.S., that are more inclined to do so through Fidelity or BlackRock than with a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Elegant and ass-backward\u2019: Jameson Lopp\u2019s first impression of Bitcoin"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is poised to record a new all-time high of $80,000 in 2024, the same year stablecoins are set to collectively settle more money than payments giant Visa, says a Bitwise senior research analyst.\n\nIn a Dec. 13 post on X (formerly Twitter), Bitwise\u2019s Ryan Rasmussen outlined 10 bullish predictions for the crypto industry in 2024, with one of the major themes being the explosive growth of the stablecoin industry.\n\nAccording to Bitwise, stablecoins will be used to settle more volume than Visa payments volume, describing the dollar and other asset-pegged tokens as one of crypto\u2019s most \u201ckiller apps.\u201d\n\nBy the third quarter of 2023, Visa processed more than $9 trillion in payments while stablecoin trading volume topped $5 trillion.\n\nPrediction #4: More money will settle using stablecoins than using Visa.\n\n\n\nStablecoins are one of crypto\u2019s \u201ckiller apps,\u201d growing from effectively zero to a $137 billion market in the past four years, and we think 2024 will be another major year of growth. pic.twitter.com/uGjRxZjsyt \u2014 Ryan Rasmussen (@RasterlyRock) December 13, 2023\n\nRasmussen pointed to stablecoins growing from a market cap of near-zero to a whopping $137 billion, all within the span of the last four years. Considering that growth trend, he predicted that stablecoins in 2024 would only witness more trading volume and utility.\n\nBitwise isn\u2019t alone in its stablecoin-oriented bullishness.\n\nIn a Dec. 13 interview with CNBC, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said the demand for stablecoins is going to explode over the next few years as investors seek the safety of internet-enabled digital dollars.\n\n\u201cHuge appetite for dollars on the internet. That\u2019s a very big thing, and that\u2019s distinct from people who want a currency hedge, so to speak, or a store-of-value hedge.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, asset manager Van Eck predicted that the total stablecoin market cap would grow to reach $200 billion by the end of 2024.\n\nRelated: \u2018I\u2019m a big fan\u2019: Cantor Fitzgerald CEO praises Tether and Bitcoin\n\nRasmussen also sees a strong year ahead for Bitcoin, which he predicts will trade above $80,000 in 2024, with the expected launch of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund and April\u2019s halving event acting as major catalysts for price growth.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin predictions for 2024 have varied widely across analysts and market commentators. In November, Bitcoin commentator Plan B said he expected the average price of Bitcoin to be at least $100,000 between 2024 and 2028. BitQuant, meanwhile, set a target price of around $250,000 after the halving in 2024. Some commentators even see the possibility of Bitcoin eventually going to $1 million.\n\nPrediction #1: Bitcoin will trade above $80,000, setting a new all-time high.\n\n\n\nThere are two major catalysts that will help get us there: the anticipated launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF in early 2024 and the halving of new bitcoin supply around the end of April. pic.twitter.com/KvHNx9XINz \u2014 Ryan Rasmussen (@RasterlyRock) December 13, 2023\n\nBitwise speculates that not only will the spot Bitcoin ETF be approved, but its launch will be the most successful ETF launch of all time, capturing $72 billion in assets under management within the next five years.\n\nBitwise is among 13 financial institutions applying for an approved spot Bitcoin ETF with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nEthereum is also predicted to improve significantly in 2024, with Bitwise betting on a 100% increase in revenue to $5 billion, adding that the EIP-4484 upgrade could bring gas costs to below $0.01 on the main network.\n\nOutside of crypto assets, Coinbase stands as the top TradFi contender to gain the most from the expected bull market of 2024, with Bitwise forecasting a 100% growth in revenue next year, something that will see it beat Wall Street expectations 10 times over.\n\nAI Eye: Deepfake K-Pop porn, woke Grok, \u2018OpenAI has a problem,\u2019 Fetch.AI"

        "title": "5 Bitcoin and Digital Asset Predictions for 2024 | USGI - U.S. Global Investors",
        "content": "If today were the last day of 2023, Bitcoin would have returned almost 155%, marking the best year since 2020, when it rose a phenomenal 305%.\n\nLike the market in general, Bitcoin has notched a strong ending to 2023 after trading rangebound for most of the year. If today were the last day of 2023, the king of digital assets would have returned almost 155%, marking the best year since 2020, when it rose a phenomenal 305%.\n\nWith only two weeks remaining in December, I figured now would be an ideal time to share my top five Bitcoin and digital asset predictions for 2024. As a reminder, these are my personal predictions and do not reflect those of U.S. Global Investors.\n\n1. A spot Bitcoin ETF will launch in the U.S., sparking a price revaluation.\n\nThere are no guarantees in life, but a U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETF now appears to be imminent.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence puts the odds of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a filing by January 10 at 90%. It\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see back-to-back launches of Bitcoin ETFs in January\u2014as many as 10, Bloomberg estimates.\n\nHow will this affect the price of the underlying asset? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are available in other markets, including Canada and Europe, but it\u2019s worth noting that the U.S. accounts for approximately 60% of the total global equity market value. One data analytics firm says that the demand spurred by a spot ETF could push the price of Bitcoin to between $50,000 and $73,000. Some readers will find this estimate too conservative.\n\nIt may be instructive to review what happened to the price of gold\u2014Bitcoin\u2019s analog cousin\u2014after the launch of the first U.S.-based gold commodity ETF, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). Before GLD and the similarly gold-backed iShares Gold Trust (IAU), investors were limited to physical bullion (which can be costly to move and store) and the futures market (which may not be appropriate for every investor).\n\nMaking its debut in November 2004, GLD increased overall demand for gold by reducing the frictional costs associated with investing in the metal and making it more accessible to a broader investor base.\n\nSince that time, the price of gold has increased nearly 360%.\n\nWhile I\u2019m on this topic, a spot Ethereum ETF could also be made available in 2024. The SEC\u2019s decision on two specific filings, from VanEck and Ark/21Shares, is expected in May. Unlike Bitcoin, Ether is not considered a commodity, but I believe such an ETF will similarly drive demand for crypto.\n\n2. Smaller miners will struggle to survive after the halving.\n\nAs many of you know, Bitcoin was programmed to have a limited supply. The number of tokens that will ever exist is capped at 21 million, and every four years, the digital asset undergoes an event called the halving. The next halving is expected in April 2024, after which the mining reward will be trimmed by 50%, from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC.\n\nThis is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the price of Bitcoin has historically rallied immediately before and after previous halving events as investors act on the reminder that supply is highly restricted.\n\nOn the other hand, smaller and less well-capitalized crypto miners will likely struggle to survive as the difficulty rate continues to climb and the mining reward is reduced by half. At the end of last month, crypto miners Hut 8 and US Bitcoin Corp completed their merger, and I expect to see additional business deals as the industry positions itself for this new era of mining difficulty.\n\n3. The $84 trillion wealth transfer will greatly benefit digital assets.\n\nThe world is about to witness the largest transfer of wealth in human history. Over the next two decades, members of the Silent Generation (those born before 1946) and Baby Boomers (1946 \u2013 1964) will leave their heirs an estimated $84.4 trillion, with Millennials (1981 \u2013 1996) being the primary beneficiary.\n\nThis will have a number of major ramifications, but as blockchain firm Galaxy reminds us, Millennials and younger generations \u201chave a higher preference for crypto\u201d than their parents and grandparents. Not only are members of this cohort \u201cdigital natives,\u201d but they\u2019ve also lived through a series of financial setbacks (the Great Recession, high inflation, restrictive borrowing costs) that, in many cases, have sullied their trust in traditional financial institutions and assets. A 2022 Investopedia survey found that Millennials as a whole were more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies than in stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, commodities and real estate.\n\nSays Galaxy\u2019s Charles Yu, \u201cShifting wealth from older generations into the hands of this crypto-friendly population is likely to result in greater inflows into Bitcoin and the broader crypto asset class.\u201d\n\n4. NFTs and Ordinals will make a huge comeback.\n\nNon-fungible tokens, or NFTs, have lost much of their cache since the bull run of 2021-2022. Many of these digital assets, permanently inscribed on the Ethereum blockchain, used to trade hands for millions of dollars. Today, however, an estimated 95% of NFTs are \u201cworthless,\u201d according to dappGambl.\n\nIs the market ready for a renaissance? I believe so, though the Bitcoin network is fast becoming the preferred platform. One year ago this week, people began inscribing text, images and other media on Bitcoin, and by May, it was being reported that the Bitcoin blockchain was the second-most popular NFT platform after Ethereum.\n\nOrdinals, as NFTs on the Bitcoin network are called, now account for over half of all daily Bitcoin transactions, and trading volumes recently hit a new record high, soaring to $36 million on December 12.\n\n5. Bitcoin miners will continue to be good stewards of energy resources.\n\nBitcoin mining is often criticized for its energy consumption, but much of this energy comes from renewable sources such as hydroelectric power, wind and solar. What\u2019s more, in the first half of 2023, the global Bitcoin network used only 0.21% of the world\u2019s energy, an inconsequential amount, according to the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC).\n\nAnother important development is the use of stranded gas, a byproduct of oil and gas operations, which is used in mining to prevent waste and reduce carbon and methane emissions. This approach is financially beneficial for miners, as it generates more revenue compared to selling the gas at market prices. It can also help comply with regulations limiting gas flaring.\n\nOn a final note, excess heat from Bitcoin mining can be recycled, as HIVE Digital Technologies is doing in Lachute, Quebec. Heat from its Bitcoin operations is being used to warm a neighboring facility, an approximately 200,000-foot swimming pool manufacturer.\n\nHave a wonderful weekend, and happy investing!\n\nIndex Summary\n\nThe major market indices finished up this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.92%. The S&P 500 Stock Index rose 2.61%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.85%. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index gained 5.66% this week.\n\nThe Hang Seng Composite gained 2.49% this week; while Taiwan was up 1.67% and the KOSPI rose 1.82%.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury bond yield fell 31 basis points to 3.911%.\n\nAirlines and Shipping\n\nStrengths\n\nThe best performing airline stock for the week was Allegiant, up 10.2%. According to Bank of America, system net sales rose 10.7% for the week in the strongest datapoint since mid-August and ahead of the flat four-week average. Both pricing and volumes accelerated this week to -0.8% and 11.6%, respectively, compared to -4.6% and 8.4% last week. The data aligns with the strong holiday demand commentary the bank has been hearing from the airlines and is better than expected heading into the off-peak period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Large corporate travel accelerated for the third consecutive week to positive 6.9%, the strongest datapoint since late April.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, air freight rates from Shanghai to North America and Europe have increased 70-75% since September 2023. The group thinks China\u2019s growing cross-border e-commerce has been one of the key drivers in addition to seasonality. In transportation, higher air freight rates should benefit players that own freighters, such as SF Holding, Cathay Pacific, and China Southern Airlines.\n\nSouthwest Airlines published an investor update tightening its December quarter revenue outlook to the better end of its prior range due to stronger-than-expected close-in bookings (including managed corporate) in the second half of the quarter. The company now expects unit revenue to be down 9% to 10% year-over-year versus down 9% to 11% prior.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe worst performing airline stock for the week was Sun Country, down 5.2%. According to Bank of America, China\u2019s air travel demand appears to be weaker than expected since November on both the domestic and non-domestic fronts. Non-domestic capacity resumption has been largely in line, and the bank expects 70% capacity by the end of 2023 and 80% by March of 2024. However, non-domestic demand resumption remains uncertain, considering headwinds from weak income outlook, RMB depreciation, and negative travel sentiment related to Southeast Asia and Japan. That said, it may take longer than expected for demand to recover from 70-80% of pre-Covid levels to a full recovery. The bank now expects a full non-domestic travel recovery to occur in the first half of 2025.\n\nScorpio Tankers updated its mid-fourth quarter TCE rates, with charter rates that were slightly shy of its targets. Its rates imply a fourth quarter fleet TCE average of approximately $33,000 per day. This implies net voyage revenues of $330 million. It booked 92%, 87%, and 84% of its spot LR2, MR, and Handymax revenue days at $38,000, $32,500, and $30,000 per day, respectively.\n\nSouthwest Airlines\u2019 flight attendants rejected a tentative flight agreement as 64% of attendants voted against the proposal. The Transport Workers Union (TWU) represents 19,000 flight attendants seeking higher pay and better work rules. The five-year proposal included a 20% pay raise beginning next month and a 3% annual raise between 2025 and 2028, as well as parental leave with insurance coverage.\n\nOpportunities\n\nAccording to Bank of America, United Airlines raised Atlantic capacity by 260/250 basis points (bps) in April/May bringing growth in those months up 5%, ahead of -1% in the first quarter of 2024, as the carrier allows 2023\u2019s capacity growth in the region to mature. Delta Air Lines similarly added 120bps of Atlantic capacity in March and April while bringing May capacity up 70bps. In April/May, Delta\u2019s Atlantic capacity growth is tracking 4% higher, only slightly ahead of the first quarter of 2024 at 3.5%.\n\nStar Bulk (SBLK) and Eagle (EGLE) are merging on a NAV-to-NAV basis. EGLE shareholders will receive 2.6211 shares of SBLK for each share of EGLE. That works out to a $52.60 per share valuation, a 17% premium. The new company will be owned 71% by current SBLK shareholders and 29% by EGLE shareholders. Both boards have agreed to the transaction.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, the latest forecast of the Forward Leading Indicator Traffic Estimate (FLITE) index, the group\u2019s proprietary short-term leading indicator of U.S. domestic air travel, predicts that RPKs will see a strong uptick in early 2024. As the Covid shock has faded significantly from 2020 peaks, the cycle component has dominated more heavily calling for a steady trend in the RPKs within the next six months, followed by a sharp inflection in March/April 2024. Normal seasonality accounts for an uptick during this time of the year, but the estimated 2024 uptick reaches pre-pandemic levels. The net result is that, per the index, demand in early 2024 is set to align with what normal growth trends from prior to the pandemic would have looked like, if the COVID pandemic had not occurred at all \u2013 a new milestone in the normalization of demand post-pandemic.\n\nThreats\n\nFlight attendant contracts are another cost headwind for U.S. airlines in 2024, which could be up to a 1 ppt CASM-ex headwind. Currently, only DAL/LUV include higher flight attendant (FA) pay in earnings. United\u2019s FA leadership requested mediation in a December 5 filing after 26 months of negotiations. American Airlines\u2019 FAs remain in mediation while Southwest\u2019s FAs voted against a TA by 64%.\n\nA relatively large part of the global container capacity will be affected by the EU\u2019s requirement that shipping from the turn of the year must buy quotas for ships\u2019 CO2 emissions. According to Alphaliner, the numbers from the end of November show that at least 10.5 million TEU, twenty-foot containers of the total global container capacity, move in and out of EU ports and will thus be affected. This corresponds to more than 37% of the container fleet.\n\nAccording to Raymond James, forecasting the standalone earnings outlook is particularly challenging for Spirit given the GTF engine issue. In late October, the company noted 10 AOG (aircraft on ground) in the fourth quarter of this year, with an average of 26 in 2024 (starting at 13 in January and stepping up to 41 in December). They are currently assuming an average of 17 AOG in 2025.\n\nLuxury Goods and International Markets\n\nStrengths\n\nNovember retail sales in the United States were reported at 0.3%, a surprise increase against the consensus for a 0.2% contraction. Annualized retail sales rose to 4.1%, up from the downwardly revised October 2.2% and the highest since February.\n\nSpanish luxury retailer, ITX (best known for its brand Zara), reported an earnings beat this week, along with Costco. Costco declared a special dividend of $15 per share, payable on January 12, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 28. Zara announced further expansion in the United States, with a focus on shoppers in Utah, Colorado, Texas, and Tennessee.\n\nRH, a home furnishing store, was the best performing S&P Global Luxury stock, gaining 27.52% in the past five days. According to a Seeking Alpha article published this week, the company transformed into a luxury brand under the leadership of CEO Gary Friedman. RH expanded into different areas such as travel and real estate and wants to grow revenue from $3 billion to $20-25 billion.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe Eurozone flash PMI for December weakened, implying a slowdown in manufacturing and service activities. The composite PMI (which combines the production and service activities in the Euro area) recorded a two-month low of 47.0 versus a consensus of 48.0 and prior 47.6.\n\nThe New York Fed\u2019s Empire State Index (a survey of business conditions in the New York region) dropped 24 points to -14.5 in December, hitting a four-month low, from a positive reading of 9.1 in November. Bloomberg economists expected a reading of 2.0. Any reading below 0 indicates worsening conditions.\n\nFarfetch, an online retailer, was the worst performing S&P Global Luxury stock, losing 47.74% in the past five days. According to a Sky News report, the company was in talks to secure emergency funding from a private equity firm due to financial trouble. UBS analyst Kunal Madhukar lowered the firm\u2019s price target to 80 cents from $3.30 and kept a \u201cneutral\u201d rating on the shares. Shares of Farfetch closed at 64 cents on Friday.\n\nOpportunities\n\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve acknowledged inflation has eased, saying that the central bank will not wait until inflation is back to 2% to start lowering rates. Rate cuts are widely expected now, with the first one as soon as March 2024. The stock market rallied, and the dollar weakened after Powell surprised with a dovish tone this week at the Fed meeting.\n\nBrunello Cucinelli released a year-end update to the market where the company upgraded its 2023 revenue growth guidance to 22-23% year-over-year (from 20-22%) and confirmed $10 revenue growth for 2024 and 2025. This became the fifth time that Cuccinelli upgraded current-year expectations when other luxury brands were experiencing much slower growth. Bank of America reiterated a \u201cbuy\u201d rating for the company.\n\nMarriot International, the largest hotel chain in the world, partnered with a local hospitality company in Costa Rica, Enjoy Group, and is planning to open two luxury hotels in 2025. Marriot created two executive roles in its vacation ownership business aiming at driving the company\u2019s long-term growth strategy. The hospitality industry continues to see strong demand for travel post-pandemic.\n\nThreats\n\nMost electric vehicle (EV) makers will get access to over 12,000 Tesla Superchargers starting next year. EV buyers may start looking more favorably upon brands other than Tesla. According to an article published on Bloomberg, the Hyundai IONIQ 6 model can charge its battery needed to drive 100 miles in about eight minutes, beating Tesla\u2019s Model 3 by three minutes. This week Tesla also announced recalling nearly all of its cars sold in the U.S. (more than 2 million) produced between Oct 5, 2012, and December 7 of this year, due to defective self-driving systems. The competition among EVs is growing.\n\nJPMorgan cut the rating on shares of luxury giant Louis Vuitton to a \u201cneutral,\u201d setting a price target of 790 euros, implying a 7.7% increase in the price. The broker warned about the first half of 2024 and is more optimistic about the luxury sector performance in the second half of next year. Kering and Ferragamo were both placed on a negative watch.\n\nThis week China held the Central Economic Work Conference and investors were surprised by the lack of strong stimulus to boost the country\u2019s growth. China\u2019s top leaders vowed to make industrial policy a top economic priority for 2024 instead of any forceful stimulus. Fitch Ratings expects the growth rate for China to drop to 4.6% next year, from 5.3% this year.\n\nEnergy and Natural Resources\n\nStrengths\n\nThe best performing commodity for the week was coffee, rising 6.86%, to a seven-month high as inventories remain at 1999 lows while dry weather forecast in Brazil could potentially stress the crops and yield less to harvest this season. According to JPMorgan, in refining, gasoline cracks have improved, and inventory levels look tighter relative to seasonal norms than they did in the early fall, while diesel remains strong with tight inventories globally and resilient demand that has held up well despite issues in the global industrial economy and weather not being particularly accommodating to heating oil demand in late 2023.\n\nAccording to JPMorgan, for copper prices to break and rally above $9,000/mt in 2024, the group still thinks a recovery impulse in ex-Chinese demand is needed. Nonetheless, in the near term, the significantly tighter supply outlook will likely be reflected in a higher risk premium in prices in the coming quarters driving a higher forecast price floor around $8,500-$8,600/mt over the first half of 2024.\n\nElectricity generated from U.S. solar and wind systems will surpass power produced by burning coal for the first time next year, driven by surging panel installations. Coal will produce about 599 billion kilowatt-hours in 2024, according to government data released Tuesday. That will be down from 669 billion kilowatt-hours this year as utilities continue to shutter coal-burning power plants.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe worst performing commodity for the week was natural gas, dropping 4.42%. Consumption of coal is set to peak this year at 8.5 billion metric tons, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Demand is expected to slide to 8.3 billion metric tons by 2026. While demand is being replaced with cleaner energy sources, the IEA doesn\u2019t see the use of coal going away soon.\n\nAccording to JPMorgan, LNG spot prices averaged US$17.02/MMBtu in November 2023, up a further 4% from the prior month but still 40% below the previous comparable period. Prices have subsequently fallen to US$15.75/MMBtu. Average prices in November implied a slope of 20% against the three-month lagged Brent price. The forward curve is now in backwardation. Contracts are currently trading at US$14.42/MMBtu in December 2024, and US$13.27/MMBtu in December 2025.\n\nOil edged lower as continuous pressure from robust supplies globally countered curbs by the OPEC+ alliance. Global benchmark Brent traded near $76 a barrel. Futures last week dipped to a multi-month low on soaring output from producers outside of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies.\n\nOpportunities\n\nGlobal copper supplies are tightening fast after the shuttering of a major mine in Panama and drastic output cuts at operations owned by Anglo American Plc. That has contributed to a slump in the fees charged by smelters to their lowest since March last year. The treatment charges, which determine margins, have dropped by about a quarter since August to $66.50 a ton, according to data from Metal Bulletin. The fees fall when there\u2019s not enough copper concentrate for smelters to refine.\n\nAccording to RBC, the U.S. House passed a bill to ban Russian uranium imports today and a companion bill will now be considered by the U.S. Senate before being sent to the White House. RBC thinks a potential U.S. ban on Russian uranium imports, with temporary waivers until January 2028, would keep uranium markets tight long-term and there is potential for an immediate retaliatory Russian ban on uranium exports to the U.S. \u2014 Russia accounted for 24% of enrichment and 12% of uranium purchased by U.S. utilities in 2022. If Russia implements an immediate export ban, RBC expects uranium prices to rise near-term as U.S. utilities seek alternative supply in an already tight market.\n\nOccidental Petroleum Corp. agreed to acquire Texas shale driller CrownRock LP in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $10.8 billion as consolidation heats up in North America\u2019s most-prolific oil basin. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals, Occidental said Monday in a statement. The company has lined up $10 billion of committed bridge financing through Bank of America Corp., according to an investor presentation.\n\nThreats\n\nMining billionaire Robert Frieland commented that in order to meet the rising demand for critical minerals, copper prices forecasted to reach $9,000 a metric ton next year isn\u2019t enough of a price incentive to bring on new production, considering the risks of huge capital-intensive mines, especially in Latin America. To spur new mine development, Frieland said the industry needs $15,000 a ton prices to spur the investment in new mines.\n\nAccording to JPMorgan, the spot prices for lithium carbonate and hydroxide have dropped significantly in the past month, by 34% and 26%, respectively, to Rmb100,000/ton. The bank maintains its bearish view due to ,1) larger surpluses across the forecast horizon, with weaker demand outweighing the impact of lower supply; and 2) marginal cost continuing to decrease. According to SMM, the China lepidolite cost curve is Rmb 70,000/ton on average, and there is no pressure to reduce supply, as miners and integrated refiners are still profitable.\n\nOPEC+ will need to carefully control oil supplies for another five years to avoid a \u201cmeltdown\u201d in crude prices, according to Rapidan Energy Group. While global oil demand will not peak for at least another decade, supplies from outside OPEC \u2014 particularly the U.S. \u2014 are growing much faster than previously estimated, the Washington- based consultant said in its latest long-term report.\n\nBitcoin and Digital Assets\n\nStrengths\n\nOf the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the best performer for the week was Bonk, rising 128%.\n\nThe amount of funds that crypto projects have lost to hackers has declined by about half to around $1.7 billion so far this year, reports Bloomberg. This comes amid improved security measures and an uptick in law enforcement actions.\n\nA former private banking executive at Credit Suisse has launched a crypto trading venue targeting banks and securities firms as clients. David Riegelnig co-founded the Zurich-based startup Rulematch, which offers a crypto trading venue for financial institutions only, writes Bloomberg.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOf the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the worst performer for the week was Rocket Pool, down 14.68%.\n\nCathie Woods\u2019 investment management firm ARK Invest sold Coinbase stock for a third straight day, as shares held steady within 5% of the year\u2019s high, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBlockchain technology will be used to verify the real-name identities of China\u2019s 1.4 billion people, according to an announcement from the Blockchain-based service network. This move is likely to spark concern among data privacy advocates, writes Bloomberg.\n\nOpportunities\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s DWS group, Dutch market maker Flow Traders, and crypto fund manager Galaxy Digital Holdings, are planning to form a company to issue a euro-denominated stablecoin with the goal of driving more mainstream adoption of tokenized assets. The company will be based in Frankfurt and led by Alexander Hoptner, a veteran exchange executive and former CEO of crypto platform BitMex, writes Bloomberg.\n\nCoinbase Global is rolling out spot crypto trading on its international exchange as part of a global expansion, saying some users are wary of U.S. venues due to the country\u2019s uncertain regulatory backdrop, Bloomberg reports.\n\nLine Next, the South Korea-based NFT unit of a joint venture between SoftBank and Naver, has secured $140 million from a consortium led by Crescendo Equity Partners, even as hype around the digital collectibles has faded, writes Bloomberg.\n\nThreats\n\nSam Bankman-Fried\u2019s (SBF) lawyer says his client was the \u201cworst\u201d witness he has ever seen, going off-script when he took the stand. That\u2019s the view of David Mills, the behind-the-scenes architect of the FTX co-founder\u2019s defense at trial, writes Bloomberg.\n\nKuCoin one of the largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, has agreed to pay $22 million in fines and refunds and stop trading in New York to resolve a lawsuit by the state. The payments will resolve claims that KuCoin failed to register as a securities and commodities broker-dealer and falsely represented itself as a crypto exchange, Bloomberg reports.\n\nThe latest crypto hack involved one of the industry\u2019s top names in security: hardware wallet-maker Ledger. The Paris-based startup saw its Ledger Connect Kit software compromised, leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars being drained from users\u2019 wallets early Thursday, writes Bloomberg.\n\nGold Market\n\nThis week gold futures closed at $2,033.00, up $18.50 per ounce, or 9.2%. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week higher by 4.38%. The S&P/TSX Venture Index came in up 1.24%. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar fell 1.35 but closed up 0.63% on Friday.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe best performing precious metal for the week was palladium, up 24.32%. Palladium headed for its biggest gain since March 2020 as the United Kingdom government targeted Russian metals \u2014 but not palladium \u2014 with new sanctions. The metal, mainly used in catalytic converters, surged as much as 12% on Thursday after the UK published measures that ban British citizens and entities from buying certain Russian metals. Palladium is still down 38% this year, with manufacturers using the cheaper platinum as a substitute.\n\nGold headed for a weekly gain in a market dominated by the Federal Reserve\u2019s strongest indications yet that it will pivot to easing monetary policy next year. The precious metal surged 2.4% on Wednesday when officials at the U.S. central bank indicated they expect to cut interest rates by 75 basis points next year, which would be positive for the non-interest-bearing metal. Economists at some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks are now calling for the Fed to ease policy earlier and faster.\n\nLoncor Gold announced it has entered into an agreement for the sale of Loncor\u2019s Makapela property for CDN$13.5 million cash. The agreement calls for the sale price to be paid in a series of progress payments beginning with a deposit of $2 million. The balance of the progress payments, totaling $11.5 million, will be paid upon completion of the transfer of title to Makapela, which is expected to occur before the end of February 2024. Makapela was a noncore asset, and now Loncor is funded for 2024.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe worst performing precious metal for the week was gold, but still up 0.92%. Workers at a South African platinum mine returned to the surface after almost three days underground following what the company called an illegal sit-in. Employees at Wesizwe Platinum\u2019s Bakubung operation northeast of Johannesburg resurfaced following discussions between management and union leadership, the company said, without elaborating on the content of the discussion.\n\nPetra Diamonds has entered into a non-binding term sheet on an exclusive basis with an interested party for the potential sale of its South African Koffiefontein Mine. There is the risk that the price may be less than expected as diamond prices and volumes are declining. The share price of Petra Diamonds is off slightly more than 40% year-to-date.\n\nThe value of polished stone exports from India\u2014a proxy for demand\u2014was down 13% year-over-year, while volumes decreased by 7% YoY, implying aggregate prices remained increased by 2% month-over-month, but down by 6% year-over-year. The Indian diamond industry ended its voluntary suspension of rough diamond import this past Friday, as there as signs of stability emerging but need further confirmation on an improvement in market condition.\n\nOpportunities\n\nAccording to Bank of America, gold remains a trade on rates. Thus, once the Fed announces a decisive end to the hiking cycle, expected in the second quarter 2024, new buyers should come into the market. If the Fed cuts earlier, gold could end the year at $2,400 per ounce versus spot around $1,980. The bank\u2019s gold price model factors in changes in gold prices, rates and the U.S. dollar, not levels. The bottom line: rates and the dollar matter, with changes in direction more important than the actual levels. As such, Bank of America expects the next leg higher for the gold price will come when the Fed cuts rate, likely in 2024.\n\nShares in Compania de Minas Buenaventura surged after Chilean copper producer Antofagasta unveiled a stake in the Peruvian miner, in an apparent move to diversify geographically away from Chile and add gold and silver exposure. Peru\u2019s top publicly traded precious metals producer jumped as much as 27% in New York trading Friday. Antofagasta, the London-listed company controlled by Chile\u2019s richest family, said it acquired a 19% stake and entered into discussions with Buenaventura to develop \u201ca framework of collaboration,\u201d including joining its board. \u201cOur investment demonstrates the significant potential we see in Buenaventura\u2019s asset portfolio,\u201d Chairman Jean-Paul Luksic said in a statement.\n\nCited on Barron\u2019s favorite 10 stocks for 2024 is Barrick Gold. Gold mining stocks haven\u2019t been able to keep up with gold prices, but 2024 may be the year that changes for Barrick. Gold miners are thought of as leveraged plays on the metal, yet Barrick shares are up just 3% this year while gold is up more than 10% to $2,036 an ounce. The company has some of the world\u2019s best mines in spots like Nevada and the Dominican Republic, and it\u2019s the top gold producer in Africa. It aims to boost its gold and to a lesser extent copper by 30% by the end of the decade. It has the industry\u2019s most effective leader in CEO Mark Bristow, a hands-on manager who visits each major mine at least three times a year. He also has a knack for handling delicate relations with host countries in the developing world. \u201cBarrick probably has the best management in the mining business, an excellent balance sheet with virtually no net debt, and a well-covered 2.3% dividend yield,\u201d says independent analyst Keith Trauner. The stock trades for about 16 times next year\u2019s projected earnings.\n\nThreats\n\nPlatinum group metals (PGM) prices have been under pressure, partially because palladium and platinum are key in auto catalysts, so the two metals are heavily exposed to cars with a combustion engine; under the technology status quo, palladium is one of the first commodities impacted by the energy transition. Anglo American notes that \u201cThe (platinum-group metals) basket price is now firmly into the cost curve, with sector returns at the lowest point seen in the last 30 years.\u201d It remains to be seen how long these prices persist and its effect on several producers.\n\nAlthough gold finished the week up, profit taking at the end of the week on Friday trimmed the gains for the week as the Fed\u2019s John Williams says talks of a rate cut in March are premature, tempering some of the enthusiasm the market has priced in. This lifted the dollar about 60 bp higher for the day but the 10-year yield displayed only a muted lift higher. Not a clear signal for the next direction in gold.\n\nRussian gold miners Highland Gold Mining, GV Gold, Trans-Siberian Gold and Kamchatka Gold were sanctioned by the U.S. government.

        "title": "Crypto Is on the Rise and Could Help You Become a Millionaire: 2 Unstoppable Crypto Stocks to Buy in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "When most people think about becoming a crypto millionaire, they usually think about buying a single crypto like Bitcoin (BTC -5.71%) and then holding on to it as it delivers stratospheric returns. Over a long enough period of time, even a relatively small upfront investment could turn into $1 million or more. And, indeed, according to Henley & Partners' Crypto Wealth Report, there are more than 40,000 Bitcoin millionaires in the world right now.\n\nBut here's another strategy that you might not have considered: buying crypto stocks that have the potential to outperform Bitcoin. This year, for example, Bitcoin is up more than 160%, but a number of crypto stocks are up 300% or more for the year. Here's a closer look at two crypto stocks that could help put you on the path to millionaire status.\n\nCoinbase Global\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN -7.17%), up a sizzling 330% in 2023, could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of any extended Bitcoin rally in 2024. When Bitcoin is down, investor interest wanes. But when Bitcoin is up, investors suddenly decide to dip their toes into the crypto waters. So Bitcoin could be the key to bringing in new users and increasing overall trading volume.\n\nBitcoin now accounts for about a third of all trading volume on the Coinbase platform. Thus, while Coinbase offers 240 possible cryptos to trade, the real focus is on Bitcoin. And right now, Coinbase appears to be looking for ways to tap into the growing investor excitement around Bitcoin. In one recent marketing promotion, all you had to do was make a single crypto trade on the platform, and you'd be entered into a drawing for two Bitcoins (worth more than $86,000 at today's prices).\n\nIn addition to courting the individual retail investor, Coinbase has been looking for ways to become more attractive to large institutional investors. In August 2022, for example, it partnered with BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, to provide crypto trading services to institutional investors. Then, last June, BlackRock tapped Coinbase to be the custodian for its highly anticipated spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering.\n\nAnd there are other long-term initiatives on tap at Coinbase, including one that involves the tokenization of real-world assets. The big idea here is to enable Wall Street firms to trade traditional financial assets on the blockchain. In August, Coinbase launched Base, its own proprietary blockchain, to help make that a reality.\n\nThe big caveat, of course, is that Coinbase has delivered such outsize returns this year that some institutional investors are starting to take profits on their positions. Ark Invest, for example, recently sold $100 million in Coinbase shares in a single week. This is most likely just routine portfolio rebalancing at the end of the year, but what if Cathie Wood of Ark Invest thinks the rally was overdone?\n\nMicroStrategy\n\nAnother crypto stock that is highly leveraged to the price of Bitcoin is MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.06%). On the surface, MicroStrategy might look a lot like an enterprise software stock. But MicroStrategy is really just a giant Bitcoin treasury. Some have even compared the company to a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nCurrently, MicroStrategy holds 174,530 Bitcoins on its balance sheet, making the company the largest public holder of Bitcoin in the world. To put that number into context, the current circulating supply of Bitcoin is about 20 million coins. Thus, MicroStrategy controls just under 1% of the total available Bitcoin supply in the world.\n\nAs might be imagined, this means that the price of MicroStrategy is highly leveraged to the price of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin goes up, then the price of MicroStrategy goes up. Year to date, Bitcoin is up more than 160% this year, and MicroStrategy is up 310%. As long as the price of Bitcoin continues to go up, the value of MicroStrategy should continue to go up too.\n\nJust keep in mind, though, that most of MicroStrategy's market value is tied up in Bitcoin. The total market cap of MicroStrategy right now is $9.1 billion, while the total value of the Bitcoins on its balance sheet is $7.5 billion. Thus, the market is giving only a small valuation to the underlying software business of MicroStrategy. While the company is now getting into AI-powered software solutions, the core enterprise software business of MicroStrategy is only growing at a 1% clip.\n\nHow much Bitcoin is too much Bitcoin?\n\nIn 2024, investors will have several ways to buy Bitcoin. They can buy Bitcoin directly in the crypto market. They will be able to buy Bitcoin via new spot Bitcoin ETFs that are expected to arrive in the first quarter of the year. And, finally, they can buy Bitcoin via \"Bitcoin proxy stocks\" like Coinbase and MicroStrategy.\n\nSo, as an investor, the question becomes: How much Bitcoin is too much Bitcoin? If you already have a sizable position in Bitcoin, you might want to diversify elsewhere beyond just companies that are tied to the price of Bitcoin. But if you are looking to amplify your Bitcoin returns and accelerate your path to millionaire status, it might be worth considering these stocks as a way to turbocharge your portfolio returns."

        "title": "1 Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Before It Soars 3,400%, According to Cathie Wood's Ark Invest - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Cathie Wood is the founder and chief executive officer of Ark Invest, an asset management company focused on disruptive technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency. Wood and her team are optimistic about the decentralized finance market, in general, but they're especially bullish on Bitcoin (BTC -5.77%).\n\nArk published a Bitcoin valuation model earlier this year that outlined three price trajectories the digital currency could follow through the end of the decade. The bull case prices Bitcoin at $1.48 million (per coin) in 2030, implying more than 3,400% upside from its price of about $42,000 at the time this article was written.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nThe investment thesis for Bitcoin\n\nThe investment thesis for Bitcoin is based on good old-fashioned supply and demand. Its source code limits supply to 21 million coins, and that scarcity is partially responsible for its value. Gold and other finite assets have value for the same reason. In fact, Bitcoin is sometimes called digital gold.\n\nThe other half of the equation is demand. When supply is fixed or highly constrained, the price of an asset moves in tandem with demand. Well, another word for demand is popularity, and Bitcoin has that in spades. It was the first widely adopted crypto asset and remains the most valuable by a wide margin. Bitcoin currently accounts for more than 50% of the collective value of all cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe real question is, in which direction will Bitcoin demand trend in the future: higher or lower? Cathie Wood sees demand intensifying in the years ahead.\n\nArk Invest's Bitcoin valuation model\n\nArk Invest recently published a Bitcoin valuation model that presents three possible price targets in 2030, as detailed below:\n\nBear case: $258,500, implying 515% upside\n\n$258,500, implying 515% upside Base case: $682,800, implying 1,525% upside\n\n$682,800, implying 1,525% upside Bull case: $1.48 million, implying 3,425% upside\n\nAll three scenarios are based on Bitcoin's ability to disrupt eight markets to varying degrees. In other words, Ark identifies eight sources of potential demand that could make Bitcoin more valuable in the future, as detailed below:\n\nCorporate treasuries: The cash and cash equivalents held by public and private companies. Ark believes Bitcoin will account for somewhere between 0% (bear) to 5% (bull) of corporate treasury holdings in 2030. Remittances: Funds sent from one person to another. The term is often used to describe money sent between family members in different countries. Ark believes Bitcoin will account for 5% (bear) to 25% (bull) of global remittance volume in 2030. Nation state treasuries: Financial assets owned by governments and primarily used to balance payments. Ark believes Bitcoin will account for 0% (bear) to 5% (bull) of global treasury reserves in 2030. Emerging market currencies: Money systems in countries undergoing robust economic expansion but don't yet possess all the qualities of a developed country. Ark believes Bitcoin will account for 0.5% (bear) to 10% (bull) of currency in emerging markets in 2030. Economic settlement: The sum of money used to settle transactions between clients of different financial institutions. Ark measures this opportunity against U.S. bank settlement volume, anticipating that Bitcoin will account for 1% (bear) to 10% (bull) of that total in 2030. HNWI assets: Financial assets owned by high-net-worth individuals (HNWI), a term usually applied to people with at least $1 million in investments. Ark believes Bitcoin will account for 1% (bear) to 5% (bull) of HNWI assets in 2030. Institutional assets: Invested assets managed by financial advisors, hedge funds, and endowments, among other types of institutional investors. Ark believes Bitcoin will account for 1% (bear) to 6.5% (bull) of institutional assets in 2030. Gold: Ark believes Bitcoin will be treated much like physical gold as a store of value, siphoning off 20% (bear) to 50% (bull) of funds that would have otherwise been invested in gold in 2030.\n\nOf those eight markets, Ark projects the largest opportunities as (1) institutional assets, (2) emerging market currencies, (3) gold alternatives, and (4) HNWI assets. Bitcoin is far from satisfying the base case estimates across those categories, let alone the bull case estimates. But some of Ark's assumptions appear plausible.\n\nFor instance, several large public companies have already incorporated Bitcoin into their treasury strategies, including Tesla, Block, MercadoLibre, and MicroStrategy. Several national governments also own Bitcoin.\n\nAdditionally, a recent survey from Fidelity found that, while penetration remains low among hedge funds and endowments, most financial advisors and HNWIs have purchased Bitcoin. Some analysts see that trend intensifying in the years ahead.\n\nPaul Maley, Deutsche Bank's global head of securities services, recently told Reuters that Bitcoin was \"bound to be seen as one of the priorities for investors and companies.\"\n\nBitcoin is worth buying for some investors, but with tempered expectations\n\nAttempting to value Bitcoin is difficult. Cryptocurrencies aren't the same as companies that generate cash or fixed-income securities, so they can't be evaluated in the same way as either. Ultimately, the extent to which Bitcoin disrupts the markets identified by Ark will depend on sentiment.\n\nHow popular will Bitcoin be with investors, companies, governments, and consumers in seven years? Answering that question with any degree of certainty is impossible. Bitcoin has only been around since 2009, so there's next to no historical precedent. For that reason, if forced to choose between Ark's three scenarios, I would choose the most conservative one.\n\nThe bear case hinges almost entirely on the idea that Bitcoin can disrupt the status quo with institutional assets and gold. That seems more likely than Bitcoin being widely adopted as an emerging market currency, settlement currency, or nation state reserve currency. To be clear, I'm not saying the 515% upside implied by the bear case is money in the bank, but rather, I'm identifying the scenario I see as most probable.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Cryptocurrency is a risky asset class. But I think investors should consider buying a small position in Bitcoin if they can (1) tolerate substantial volatility, (2) handle losing money, and (3) commit to holding their Bitcoin for at least five to seven years."

        "title": "2 Crypto Stocks to Snag Now Before They Really Take Off - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Heading into 2024, the biggest story in crypto continues to be Bitcoin (BTC -5.77%), which is up more than 150% this year. But the best may be yet to come. The arrival of the first spot Bitcoin ETF is now expected in the first quarter of 2024, and that will be followed by one of the most highly anticipated events in the crypto industry: the Bitcoin halving.\n\nWhile it's not a guarantee that these two catalysts will extend the Bitcoin rally into 2024, there is one way that you can get access to the potential upside of Bitcoin without having to deal with the risk and volatility of the crypto market. And that's by buying crypto stocks that are highly correlated with Bitcoin's price. Two of the best options right now are MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.06%) and Riot Platforms (RIOT -6.82%).\n\nMicroStrategy\n\nLet's start with MicroStrategy, which is the largest public holder of Bitcoin in the world, by a long shot. About 0.75% of the entire Bitcoin supply in the world is now on MicroStrategy's balance sheet.\n\nAt the end of November, MicroStrategy scooped up another 16,130 Bitcoins and now holds 174,530 Bitcoins. By way of comparison, that's 12 times more Bitcoin than held by Marathon Digital Holdings, the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining company. And it's 17 times more Bitcoin than held by Coinbase Global, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world.\n\nIn short, MicroStrategy is just about as good of a proxy for Bitcoin as you're going to get in the stock market. Right now, the market values MicroStrategy at about $9 billion. The amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet is valued at $7.5 billion. So most of the value of the company is based on the value of Bitcoin! This explains why MicroStrategy is up more than 300% this year. As long as the company continues to add to its Bitcoin position in 2024, its value should also continue to skyrocket.\n\nRiot Platforms\n\nWhile Riot Platforms is not the largest Bitcoin mining stock, it's generally acknowledged as among the best run and the most cost effective. In large part, this is due to Riot's strategy of continually upgrading to the most efficient and powerful Bitcoin mining rigs.\n\nEvery month, Riot Platforms releases a Bitcoin production update, and the numbers continue to look good. In November 2023, the amount of Bitcoin mined increased 21% on a month-over-month basis. At the same time, the number of mining rigs deployed increased by 6% on a month-over-month basis. There are plans to deploy even more mining rigs in 2024, and all signs point to Riot Platforms going all in on the Bitcoin halving next year.\n\nWhile Riot Platforms is up more than 350% this year, there may still be more room to run. According to J.P. Morgan, analyst price forecasts for Riot range as high as $23. That would be a 50% increase from today's price of a little moire than $15.\n\nAnd if you look at how Riot Platforms performed during the last Bitcoin halving in 2020, there's even more room for hope. The stock went from $2 in May 2020 to $10 by year-end. And then, in 2021, the stock went parabolic, more than quadrupling in value. Just keep in mind, though, that past results are no guarantee of future performance. But it's certainly instructive for seeing just how much of an impact the Bitcoin halving might have on Riot's price.\n\nBut is it too late?\n\nThe main caveat, of course, is that these stocks are not hidden gems. Everybody in the crypto industry knows about them. That's why both are up so much this year. So it could be the case that they have already gone up too far, too fast, and won't be able to replicate the same type of performance in 2024.\n\nBut I don't think that's the case. There are two strong catalysts in place for Bitcoin next year, and it's likely that Bitcoin will continue to gain in value next year. That's why I've specifically highlighted two stocks that are directly tied to Bitcoin's price. If Bitcoin is ready to rise even higher next year, then these two stocks are likely to go along for the ride."

He followed a disciplined \u2014 or foolhardy, according to critics \u2014 dollar-cost-averaging strategy.\n\nIn early December, Bukele took a leave of absence to prepare for his 2024 election campaign, but he hopped on X last week for a victory lap of sorts and to take a jab at his \u201cnaysayers\u201d:\n\nEl Salvador's #Bitcoin investments are in the black!\n\n\n\nAfter literally thousands of articles and hit pieces that ridiculed our supposed losses, all of which were calculated based on #Bitcoin\u2019s market price at the time...\n\n\n\nWith the current #Bitcoin market price, if we were to sell\u2026 pic.twitter.com/gvl2GfQMfb \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) December 4, 2023\n\nIt was a diverting sideshow, but it raised some real questions: Is the former president justified in declaring vindication given that El Salvador\u2019s BTC investment was only marginally profitable? (On Dec. 11, it slipped into the red again.)\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin still hasn\u2019t been widely adopted by the Salvadoran public to pay for goods and services, nor is it used by Salvadorans working overseas to send money home through remittances.\n\nRecent: How the crypto bull run can impact Web3 gaming beyond play-to-earn\n\nFinally, given that El Salvador remains a small, indebted, poor country, was it really responsible for its leaders to gamble taxpayer money on high-risk Bitcoin purchases?\n\n\u201cA bold and unprecedented move\u201d\n\nBukele has his defenders. El Salvador was in desperate economic straits back in 2021, and nothing seemed to be working.\n\n\u201cEl Salvador took a bold and unprecedented move in adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, which was roundly criticized by the IMF, among others,\u201d Nigel Green, CEO of the deVere Group, told Cointelegraph, adding:\n\n\u201cSomething new had to be done to end decades of financial instability and reliance on the U.S. dollar in the country. Nothing else has previously been successful in this regard.\u201d\n\nBukele \u201cdeclared Bitcoin legal tender and provided the citizens of El Salvador the opportunity to adopt an alternative financial system that is different from the dollar,\u201d Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether and chief technology officer at Bitfinex, told Cointelegraph. \u201cIt takes a lot of confidence and belief to withstand the pressure of international creditors and economic policymakers to stick with that resolve.\u201d\n\nAt one point in 2022, El Salvador\u2019s BTC investment portfolio was underwater by more than 50%. However, Bukele \u201cstuck to his guns, and he made it through,\u201d added David Tawil, president of ProChain Capital. Tawil expects other economically struggling nations to emulate El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin example. Argentina could be next.\n\nAt the time of writing, El Salvador has purchased 2,770 BTC in total at an average price of $42,436.22 per coin for a portfolio cost of $117.5 million, according to the \u201cNayib Bukele Portfolio Tracker,\u201d which follows the changes in El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin stash.\n\nIt was running an overall profit of $4.16 million \u2014 up 3.54% \u2014 as recently as Dec. 9, when BTC was selling for about $44,000. Bukele\u2019s first bulk BTC purchase was made on Sept. 6, 2021; his last was on Nov. 18, 2022, shortly after FTX imploded. There were 12 bulk purchases in all, after which Bukele still committed to buying 1 BTC per day.\n\nBut on Dec. 11, the portfolio dropped underwater again \u2014 down 1.15% \u2014 as BTC dipped below $42,000.\n\nIrresponsible governance?\n\nGiven the ongoing crypto market volatility, it isn\u2019t surprising that some ask whether Bitcoin is an appropriate investment for a sovereign government, let alone one so heavily indebted.\n\n\u201cSpeculating with public resources in a context in which extreme poverty and food insecurity are increasing is irresponsible,\u201d Lourdes Molina, senior economist at the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies, told Cointelegraph. \u201cThe taxpayers\u2019 money allocated to the implementation of the Bitcoin Law has had a high opportunity cost for Salvadoran citizens.\u201d\n\nThose funds invested in Bitcoin should have been used instead to finance public goods and services, Molina added. The new law has had other unforeseen effects, too:\n\n\u201cThe economic risks derived from the implementation of the Bitcoin Law persist, particularly those linked to the possibility of turning the country into a tax haven and facilitating money laundering. Other risks have been contained by the non-mass use of the currency.\u201d\n\nGeorge Selgin, senior fellow and director emeritus of the Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives at the Cato Institute and professor emeritus of economics at the University of Georgia, told Cointelegraph that the country\u2019s monetary experiment, as initially conceived, went well beyond a big crypto investment:\n\n\u201cEl Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin scheme wasn\u2019t sold as a risky investment gambit \u2014 though it was certainly that. It was an attempt to achieve the \u2018Bitcoinization\u2019 of El Salvador\u2019s dollarized economy. And with respect to that end, it has been a complete flop.\u201d\n\nIn late 2022, Cointelegraph reporter Joseph Hall traveled to El Salvador to see if he could survive in the country using Bitcoin alone for payments. For two weeks, \u201cI tried to pay for every single thing with Bitcoin, or satoshis \u2014 small amounts of Bitcoin. Spoiler alert: I failed.\u201d\n\nIn El Salvador, the U.S. dollar remains the overwhelming payment \u201cmedium of choice,\u201d Selgin noted, \u201cfor all, save some Bitcoin tourists.\u201d It isn\u2019t used by Salvadorans living overseas to send money home, though remittances were billed as a natural use case for Bitcoin. \u201cWhy any other country would wish to follow such an example is beyond me,\u201d Selgin said.\n\nPart of a bigger plan\n\nStill, it\u2019s important to put the country\u2019s Bitcoin expenditures into a larger context. It is just one element in a plan to make El Salvador economically independent. Bukele also implemented a number of bond buyback programs to restore the country\u2019s debt profile and expanded the tax base \u201cby welcoming immigration and returning citizens to the country,\u201d Ardoino told Cointelegraph, adding:\n\n\u201cEl Salvador now has among the best-performing bonds among emerging market countries and is seen as a safe and attractive place to visit. The country\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin has brought them investment, tourism and international recognition.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order for the project to get off the ground, [Bukele] had to pitch it with high \u2014 maybe excessive \u2014 expectations,\u201d Tawil told Cointelegraph. \u201cNo one really expected that it [BTC] would be a medium of exchange in the short term.\u201d\n\nThat part of the experiment was \u201cpremature,\u201d Tawil continued, mostly because Bitcoin still has usability shortcomings. \u201cIt\u2019s not simple enough yet \u2014 it\u2019s not as easy as a credit card.[...] But it will get easier,\u201d he predicted.\n\nIn the meantime, the positive return on El Salvador\u2019s BTC investment portfolio \u2014 if it persists \u2014 will likely catch the eye of other sovereign nations. Inflation-wracked Argentina, for one, has a new president, Javier Milei, who is well-disposed toward crypto, and he could borrow some elements from El Salvador\u2019s BTC pioneer program. Many people remain unbanked in Argentina, so Bitcoin could be helpful.\n\nFailure as a medium of exchange?\n\nThe lack of retail usage remains a sore point. Much was made two years back about El Salvador\u2019s efforts to encourage its citizens to use Bitcoin for retail purchases. The government spent millions distributing Chivo wallets and small amounts of (free) BTC to citizens, and in the end, the results were disappointing. Doesn\u2019t that detract from Bukele\u2019s legacy?\n\n\u201cWhenever you introduce something very different, you cannot expect instant success and instant results,\u201d answered Ardoino. \u201cPeople forget that when credit cards and debit cards were first introduced, it took 10 years for them to gain acceptance in Europe, and it was not until 20 years later that we saw full coverage.\u201d\n\nAs for investing in risky assets, \u201cGovernments make investments all the time, of course they do,\u201d said Green. \u201cBut El Salvador experienced significant ire \u2014 more than for anything else \u2014 for investing in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhy the IMF, an organization whose mission is to \u201cachieve sustainable growth and prosperity,\u201d fears a future-focused solution is \u201cbaffling,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe S&P 500 entered a bear market for the first time since March 2020,\u201d continued Green. \u201cMany investments were underwater,\u201d but \u201csavvy investors do not just panic sell during bear markets.\u201d\n\nA work in progress?\n\nOverall, is it still too early to say whether El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin journey is a success or failure?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed report, but then it always would be when launching a new legal and digital tender with no roadmap to do so,\u201d commented Green.\n\nTawil called the country\u2019s BTC gamble a \u201c100% success.\u201d Look at the cost basis for its BTC purchases \u2014 those \u201cmay never be seen again,\u201d at least by any sovereign nation. El Salvador was prescient, he believes.\n\nConversely, economist Selgin argued that the small profit made so far on El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin splurge is largely irrelevant. Things could have easily gone south:\n\n\u201cNo responsible government places risky bets with tax funds, and it is utterly irresponsible for a poor country to do so. Whether the gamble pays off or not is really beside the point.\u201d\n\nMolina also gave El Salvador low marks for its Bitcoin venture. \u201cTo this day, the arguments of attracting investment, generating employment or promoting financial inclusion have not been fulfilled. The only thing that has been socialized is the cost that citizens have had to assume,\u201d she said.\n\nMagazine: Terrorism & Israel-Gaza war weaponized to destroy crypto\n\nArdoino, by contrast, judged El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin pivot a \u201csuccess so far.\u201d Bitcoin has brought the country ancillary benefits in tourism and investment, \u201cand now El Salvador is developing an entire financial industry based on digital assets.[...] On the current trajectory, El Salvador is poised to be the new financial center for Latin America.\u201d\n\nGreen referenced a Sept. 8 report from Spanish banking giant Santander that lauded El Salvador for its new \u201cmarket friendly approach on policy management\u201d and an increasing willingness to repay debt. The rise in Salvadoran bond prices \u201calmost defies gravity,\u201d commented Santander, and the country may soon be able to access Eurobond capital markets.\n\nIt should also be remembered that El Salvador \u201chas a bleak history of defaulting on its international debt obligations,\u201d Green added, but \u201cis now unlikely to do so until at least 2029, according to most experts, which is pretty remarkable considering the history.\u201d"

        "content": "The Bitcoin ecosystem has witnessed a dramatic recovery as the market cap of BRC-20 tokens surpassed $4 billion shortly after their invention in January.\n\nAccording to a Dec. 15 research report by cryptocurrency exchange Bitget seen by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin (BTC) miners\u2019 earnings from on-chain fees have surged from 1.7% in August to 19.57% by November. Meanwhile, daily mining revenue from block rewards surged past $40 million in November. The namesake digital asset has gained 161% year-to-date.\n\nInvented by Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor in January, BRC-20 tokens have surged in popularity as one of the largest technological advancements in a 15-year-old blockchain. Bitcoin Ordinals is a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each satoshi, or 1/100 millionth of a Bitcoin, enabling tracking and transfer. Combined with the inscription process, which adds a layer of data to each Satoshi, users can mint unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe Ordinals (ORDI) token \u2014 the first memecoin created via the BRC-20 standard but not related to the Ordinals protocol itself \u2014 currently has a market cap of $1.34 billion. Meanwhile, researchers have also noted the emergence of other Bitcoin token standards, such as ARC-20 from Atomicals Protocol, in adding value to the Bitcoin ecosystem:\n\n\u201cUnlike Ordinals, which rely on third-party sorters to order asset transactions, the Atomicals protocol\u2019s ARC-20 standard uses Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit, Satoshi, as the smallest unit for issuing assets. This allows Atomicals assets to trace a complete transfer history without relying on any third-party sorter.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Atomical Protocol includes ARC-20 tokens, nonfungible tokens, Bitcoin domain names known as \u201crealms,\u201d and on-chain data object storage known as \u201cCollection Containers.\u201c \u201cAs of this date, there have been a total of 366,879 mints on the Atomicals Protocol, cumulatively costing 55.8 BTC ($2.4 million). The total number of mints on this protocol accounts for 2.69% of the total mints on Ordinals,\u201d researchers wrote.\n\nDespite high gas fees, there exists a strong community demand for minting BRC-20 tokens. Using the example of the Sats (SATS) memecoin, researchers noted that SATS was fully minted on Sept. 24, with 21,107,258 mints and 36,061 holders, despite gas fees costing over $15 million. \u201c[Layer-two solutions such as] the Lightning Network will serve as the largest technical foundation supporting the adoption of Bitcoin payments on a larger scale,\u201d researchers concluded in their predictions for 2024.\n\nRelated: Why has Bitcoin price hit new all-time highs in Turkey, Egypt, Nigeria and Argentina?"

        "content": "While Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization gives many the freedom to transfer assets without the risk of censorship, malicious actors are also taking advantage of the network\u2019s inherent privacy to move stolen funds.\n\nBefore being sanctioned by the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2022, Tornado Cash was the prominent choice for hackers to launder stolen crypto. According to OFAC, over $7 billion in crypto assets have been laundered using the mixer since 2019. However, new findings from blockchain security firm CertiK show that there\u2019s been a shift in 2023.\n\nData analyzed by CertiK shows that more than $300 million in the stolen proceeds from 50 of the largest exploits of 2023 ended up in Bitcoin, as hackers try to find other places to move their ill-gotten gains after the increased regulatory scrutiny toward Tornado Cash.\n\nFunds lost from 50 of the largest crypto exploits in 2023. Source: CertiK\n\nCrypto mixers are protocols that are used to keep crypto transactions private. The tool mixes potentially identifiable funds with vast sums of other funds to anonymize transfers between wallet addresses.\n\nJoe Green, CertiK\u2019s quick response team head, told Cointelegraph that while decentralization and privacy in Bitcoin empower legitimate users, malicious actors can also exploit it for their gain. Green explained:\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin ecosystem hosts a variety of privacy mixers that serve both privacy-conscious users and those with nefarious intentions. [...] While this scenario presents a challenge, it\u2019s important to recognize it as an intrinsic aspect of decentralized systems.\u201d\n\nThe shift into Bitcoin (BTC) mixers means that malicious actors are trying to find a way to ditch Tornado Cash because of regulatory sanctions. CertiK\u2019s analysis showed that Bitcoin mixers like Sinbad, which was sanctioned and shut down by U.S. authorities, have been the tool of choice for the infamous crypto hacker group Lazarus in 2023.\n\nRelated: KyberSwap hacker demands complete control over Kyber company\n\nAccording to CertiK, Bitcoin mixers employ a different approach to anonymizing transactions. With mixers like Tornado Cash, the mixer obfuscates the link between the sender and the receiver. However, the user can only withdraw the same amount they inserted into a new wallet, minus a fee.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin mixers allow users to deposit Bitcoin and distribute it across multiple wallets in different percentages, which further complicates tracking.\n\nHow Bitcoin mixers work. Source: CertiK\n\nWhile Tornado Cash remains a \u201cgo-to\u201d mixer for smaller-scale cybercrimes, CeriK highlighted that incidents involving $50 million and above have been pivoting toward Bitcoin-based laundering solutions. CertiK believes that this may be a trend and a preview of the challenges ahead for the crypto space.\n\nAs crypto laundering tactics evolve, there is an urgent need for more dynamic countermeasures in the battle against blockchain-based financial crime. Green explained:\n\n\u201cPerhaps the most effective countermeasure is comprehensive tracing of movements of \u2018dirty\u2019 funds. The sharing of information with relevant parties such as exchanges is an important step as well.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the security professional also believes that it\u2019s essential for stakeholders to be aware of the tactics that criminals employ so that they can combat them.\n\nMagazine: HTX hacked again for $30M, 100K Koreans test CBDC, Binance 2.0: Asia Express"

        "content": "Today, Bitcoin exchange River has unveiled its latest product, River Link, aiming to transform the way Bitcoin is sent and received on a global scale. River Link facilitates the seamless transfer of Bitcoin through text messages, offering users a straightforward and user-friendly experience that eliminates the complexities often associated with Bitcoin transactions.\n\nTraditionally, sending Bitcoin to new users involves the creation and exchange of a public address, a process that can be cumbersome for non-technical users. River Link seeks to overcome these challenges by leveraging the widespread use of messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, as well as social media websites such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. With River Link, users can now send Bitcoin effortlessly to anyone, anywhere in the world, regardless of their technical understanding.\n\n\"River Link aims to build on the incredible rails that Bitcoin offers by allowing you to send Bitcoin to anyone over a text message, email, or direct message,\" said River CEO Alex Leishman. \u201cWe reimagined the Bitcoin transaction experience \u2014 embracing the simplicity of a user-centric app with Bitcoin\u2019s ethos of an open network.\u201d This flexibility ensures that recipients can claim their Bitcoin securely and conveniently, regardless of their jurisdiction or technical know-how.\n\nRiver envisions River Link as a significant step toward realizing its goal of positioning Bitcoin as the premier medium of exchange worldwide. \u201cThe traditional Bitcoin transaction experience is clunky. Other companies have attempted to solve this with siloed features that require both parties to use the same app,\u201d says Leishman. \u201cThis improves the transaction experience, but restricts user choice and dictates where people need to hold their Bitcoin.\u201d By providing a user-friendly and accessible platform for Bitcoin transactions, River aims to bring the benefits of Bitcoin to a broader audience, making it easier for individuals to engage in transactions.\n\nAddressing the common challenges associated with Bitcoin transactions, River's Chief Operating Officer, Julia Duzon, notes that River Link simplifies the multi-step process of paying or gifting Bitcoin. Duzon emphasizes the practical applications of River Link, stating, \"There is now an easier way to give your friend a birthday gift, pay a co-worker for lunch, or simply get your family into Bitcoin. With River Link, Bitcoin is another step closer to our vision of being the best medium of exchange in the world.\"\n\n\u201cSimply enter the amount of the River Link, text it to your friend, and they can claim the Bitcoin to any wallet,\u201d says Duzon. \u201cThis experience is truly frictionless, interoperable, and open \u2014 the way Bitcoin was always intended to be.\u201d\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto may soon see another mass wave of adoption by United States-based firms after a new accounting rule change that lets companies more accurately reflect the value of their crypto holdings.\n\nCory Klippsten, the CEO of Bitcoin-only exchange Swan Bitcoin, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin-holding companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla, which both had to report impairment on their holdings, \u201ccan now more accurately reflect their Bitcoin investments\u2019 true value.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis change is crucial for a broad range of companies, not just those primarily focused on Bitcoin, encouraging more mainstream corporate adoption.\u201d\n\nThe new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rules released on Dec. 13 that come into effect in December 2024 see the estimated market value of crypto held by companies represented accurately on companies\u2019 accounting books by allowing them to record when they\u2019re holding assets at a gain.\n\nPreviously, crypto held by companies was subject to impairment only when the value of crypto decreased on the books, which could not be increased until sold, even if its value increased while being held.\n\nKlippsten added that companies could now use Bitcoin as a \u201cstrategic financial asset,\u201d as they would be able to report on their value gains and losses, a feature that could help drive adoption.\n\nMatrixport research head and Crypto Titans author Markus Thielen told Cointelegraph that the rule change \u201cunderscores the palpable corporate demand\u201d for incorporating crypto into a firm\u2019s accounting.\n\nRelated: BlackRock revises spot Bitcoin ETF to enable easier access for banks\n\n\u201cDigital assets are increasingly becoming a crucial component of financial statements,\u201d said Thielen, adding that companies will now have more confidence when valuing their crypto holdings.\n\n\u201cThis signals a resounding confirmation that digital assets have firmly established themselves in the financial landscape.\u201d\n\nOthers were also excited by the rule change. David Marcus, co-creator of Facebook\u2019s binned stablecoin project Diem, posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Dec. 13, saying the new rules are \u201cactually a big deal,\u201d which remove \u201ca large obstacle standing in the way of corporations holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet.\u201d\n\nYou may think this is a small accounting change that doesn\u2019t mean much.

        "title": "Lolli raises $8M Series B to expand its bitcoin and cashback rewards to enterprises - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Lolli, a bitcoin and cashback rewards application, has raised an $8 million Series B round, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.\n\nThe company\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Alex Adelman, said the fresh capital will be used to roll out Lolli\u2019s rewards program to enterprise partners like exchanges, neobanks, banks, payment companies and browsers.\n\nTo date, Lolli has raised over $28 million. \u201cWe have historically raised the amount needed to win,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take more money than we need to support our next phase of growth, and are very focused on operating efficiently and proving out our business model.\u201d\n\nThe Series B round was led by BITKRAFT Ventures, with participation from Sfermion, Ulta Beauty\u2019s Prisma Ventures, Hypersphere Ventures, ZebPay\u2019s CEO Rahul Pagidipati, 2 Punks Capital, MZ Web3 Fund and others. Previous investors Seven Seven Six, Founders Fund\u2019s Pathfinder Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, Serena Williams\u2019 Serena Ventures, Logan Paul and MrBeast\u2019s Night Media also invested.\n\nSince launching in 2018, the app has grown substantially and currently partners with more than 25,000 stores. Its rewards program awards its users with bitcoin or cashback when they shop online or in person at restaurants and stores. \u201cLolli is on track to expand the number of stores where users can shop to over 100,000 by 2025,\u201d Adelman said.\n\nThe app gives up to 30% back on purchases, with an average of 7% back in bitcoin or cashback rewards. Since its inception, Lolli has given over $10 million in bitcoin rewards, in addition to cashback rewards, Adelman said.\n\nLast year, the company launched Card Boosts, which lets users add bitcoin rewards to their debit or credit cards when they shop. Adelman called the product a \u201ctremendous growth-driver\u201d that helped users earn over five times the rewards on daily purchases like coffee, gas or groceries. As of October 2023, Lolli\u2019s active shoppers have increased by more than 35% year-over-year, he added.\n\n\u201cMany of our users know the value of \u2018earning the dip\u2019 and have seen the benefits of earning bitcoin rewards with Lolli when the market is down,\u201d Adelman said.\n\nThis means users who earned rewards when bitcoin was at $20,000 or lower in the beginning of 2023 have seen the value of their rewards double, given that bitcoin is over $40,000 today. \u201cThe earliest Lolli users who earned bitcoin when it was at around $3,000 have seen their rewards increase in worth by more than 10X today,\u201d Adelman said.\n\nAs market players anticipate a greater breakout from bitcoin rising over 12% on the month, Lolli is also preparing by building new ways for users to earn rewards. The company plans to use the momentum in the markets to \u201cdrive more revenue to partners and bring more major companies into offering bitcoin rewards,\u201d Adelman said. In 2024, Lolli plans to roll out more products, \u201cbig partnerships\u201d and financial education, he added.\n\n\u201cWe are growing quickly, and over the next few months, we\u2019ll be rolling out new features and merchant partnerships that we think our users will love,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cAs crypto adoption keeps rising, we are focused on becoming a holistic solution for our users to earn money every day, multiple times a day, and to learn about and earn bitcoin.\u201d"

        "content": "Lolli, a crypto firm that offers free bitcoin rewards for shopping, has raised $8 million in a Series B funding round.\n\nBitkraft Ventures led the round, with Sfermion, Ulta Beauty's Prisma Ventures, Hypersphere Ventures, ZebPay's Rahul Pagidipati and others participating, Lolli said Thursday. Existing investors, including Alexis Ohanian's Seven Seven Six, Founders Fund's Pathfinder Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, Serena Williams' Serena Ventures and Logan Paul, also backed the round.\n\nThe funding comes two and a half years after Lolli's Series A round, with an amount lower than that round, which was sized at $10 million. Lolli founder and CEO Alex Adelman said the firm has historically been \"very intentional\" in raising just the amount needed to reach its next growth phase. \"With this round, we have just the right amount needed to win without diluting our existing investors and team,\" Adelman told The Block.\n\nLolli started the fundraising process in early 2023 while getting \"significant M&A interest\" in parallel throughout the year, Adelman said \u2014 adding that the firm decided to go the fundraising path to remain independent and closed the round in November. He declined to comment on Lolli's valuation with Series B but said it was all equity financing.\n\nAs part of the deal, Bitkraft Ventures partner Carlos Pereira has joined Lolli's board, Adelman said \u2014 adding that the Bitkraft team's expertise across gaming and immersive technology will help Lolli bring bitcoin to more people through \"gamified earning experiences.\"\n\nLolli's growth plans\n\nFounded in 2018, Lolli gives shoppers bitcoin or cashback rewards on everyday purchases. The firm says its users have earned more than $10 million in bitcoin rewards to date. Adelman declined to comment on the amount of cashback rewards to date but said Lolli's user base continued to grow over 35% year-over-year as of October. \"We also saw a record-breaking holiday season, with an increase in spending on Lolli that surpassed the national average,\" he said.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nTo bring more users into crypto, Lolli now plans to tie up with enterprises, similar to how it has partnered with merchants and other companies over the years. \"We will be working closely with exchanges, neobanks, banks, payment companies, and browsers to drive increased sales, revenue, and engagement with Lolli's patented rewards technology,\" Adelman said.\n\nInternational expansion has also been on Lolli's roadmap since at least 2021. Adelman said the firm will explore those markets next year \"when the market is right for global bitcoin rewards adoption.\"\n\nLolli Card Boosts\n\nLast year, Lolli also launched an in-store rewards program called Card Boosts. Adelman said the number of stores Lolli users can earn from is currently 25,000, but that is \"on track to reach over 100,000 by 2025.\"\n\nThere are currently 20 people working for Lolli, and Adelman looks to expand the team strategically in the new year across various functions. Lolli remains focused on bitcoin rewards but is open to exploring other cryptocurrencies if there is strong user demand, Adelman said."

        "content": "Bitwise believes crypto is on the cusp of entering its \u201cmainstream era\u201d as we enter 2024 and outlined ten predictions of what\u2019s to come in the year ahead.\n\nHaving outperformed major asset classes in 2023 \u2014 up over 150% year-to-date compared to 22% for the S&P, 40% for the Nasdaq and 12% for gold \u2014 Bitwise analysts expect bitcoin to continue that trend, reaching an all-time high above $80,000 in 2024, according to a report.\n\nThe analysts cite two main catalysts for this. Firstly, a wave of new capital following anticipated spot bitcoin ETF approvals on the demand side \u2014 potentially capturing 1% of the $7.2 trillion U.S. ETF market, or $72 billion, within five years. Secondly, on the supply side, the Bitcoin BTC -4.99% halving event (when the block reward gets cut in half) is expected to fall in April. Bitwise said this was equivalent to a $6.2 billion reduction in new bitcoin entering the market each year.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF in the United States, having previously approved futures-based funds in 2021. The next deadlines for the SEC\u2019s decision to approve, reject or delay applications from firms \u2014 including Bitwise, as well as VanEck, BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity and Valkyrie \u2014 fall in mid-January. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart recently said the window for potential spot bitcoin ETF approval was looking like it would fall between Jan. 5 and Jan. 10, with a 90% probability of success.\n\nBitcoin currently trades at $42,409 \u2014 up 18% over the past month, according to The Block\u2019s price data.\n\nEthereum revenue to double and average transaction fees to fall below one cent\n\nOne criticism of blockchains is that they don\u2019t generate cash flow in the traditional sense. Bitwise says that\u2019s wrong, with Ethereum ETH -5.63% hosting thousands of crypto applications generating fees.\n\nThe analysts said Ethereum is on track to generate around $2.3 billion in fees this year and expects that to more than double in 2024 to over $5 billion as crypto apps go mainstream \u2014 making Ethereum one of the fastest-growing tech platforms in the world.\n\nAt the same time, Bitwise expects a major upgrade to Ethereum to significantly drive down the average fees paid by users. The analysts said the EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as Proto-Danksharding, could push fees paid on Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 chains (like Arbitrum, Base and Optimism) below $0.01 from around $0.14 \u2014 though fees on Ethereum\u2019s base layer remain substantially higher.\n\nBitwise said this could open up additional use cases like micropayments, social media and large-scale gaming applications, paving the way for mainstream adoption.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nTaylor Swift launching NFTs to connect with fans in new ways\n\nPop star Taylor Swift, whose Eras Tour recently became the first to gross over $1 billion, may also launch NFTs to connect with fans in new ways in 2024, according to Bitwise \u2014 claiming she has a reputation for uniquely engaging with fans and is a \u201cstaunch believer in artists owning and monetizing their music.\u201d\n\nThe analysts said NFTs could provide a new medium for just that, from offering exclusive access to concerts, experiences and new music to providing fans partial ownership of their songs via royalties. \u201cMajor bands and artists, ranging from Snoop Dogg and Eminem to Kings of Leon and The Chainsmokers, have already embraced NFTs in one way or another,\u201d they added.\n\nBitwise also highlighted Spotify \u2014 where Swift is the most streamed artist this year \u2014 experimenting with token-gated playlists that require certain NFTs to unlock access as one avenue for the singer.\n\nLast year, Swift was one celebrity influencer who managed to dodge a bullet on partnering with the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, though later reports suggested she was not the one to have shaken off a deal.\n\nBitwise\u2019s other predictions for the year ahead\n\nThe Bitwise analysts anticipate crypto exchange Coinbase\u2019s revenue to double next year from $2.8 billion to $5.7 billion \u2014 more than ten times average Wall Street expectations \u2014 as a bull market unfolds, Coinbase expands its products and the company positions itself to be the prime custodian for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe asset manager also expects stablecoins to settle more money than Visa next year, JPMorgan to tokenize a fund and launch it on-chain as Wall Street gears up to tokenize real-world assets, and one in four financial advisors to allocate to crypto in client accounts by the end of 2024.\n\nAdditionally, Bitwise sees AI assistants beginning to use crypto to pay for things online as it becomes the \"native currency of the internet,\" and more than $100 million staked in prediction markets as they become the next \u201ckiller apps\u201d in crypto.\n\nLast year, despite correctly predicting the crypto market recovery, Coinbase\u2019s market cap doubling and the amount of staked ether rising over 50%, Bitwise was wrong in expecting USDC to surpass USDT as the world\u2019s largest stablecoin and in predicting the U.S. Congress would pass at least one piece of significant crypto legislation in 2023.\n\nLast week, fellow asset managers VanEck published its predictions for the year ahead. VanEck expects a long-awaited U.S. recession to finally arrive in 2024 but still anticipates spot bitcoin ETF approvals and the halving event to spur bitcoin to all-time highs by Q4."

If denied, investment managers will likely appeal the ruling, which will prolong the waiting even further.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF directly tracks the real-time market price of Bitcoin, holding actual Bitcoin. Its value reflects the current price of BTC under its ownership. Conversely, a futures Bitcoin ETF invests in Bitcoin futures contracts, which are agreements on the future price of Bitcoin, rather than holding the cryptocurrency itself. The SEC approved the first futures Bitcoin ETF in 2021.\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation \u2014 Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere are a few essential truths that govern accepted thinking about blockchain networks. One such truth is that, without compromises like wrapped tokens and blockchain bridges, proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum and proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin are tantamount to water and oil: They just don\u2019t mix.\n\nNow, a new startup led by a Stanford professor and a former Dolby engineer is attempting to disprove that. Babylon, a project that seeks to allow users to stake Bitcoin (BTC) to validate nodes on a variety of proof-of-stake networks including Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon, is already well on its way to achieving its improbable-sounding goal.\n\nThe company just raised an $18 million funding round co-led by Polychain Capital and Hack VC, with participation from funds including Framework Ventures, Polygon Ventures, OKX Ventures, and Castle Island Ventures. It is also in ongoing conversations with multiple blockchain networks about integrating its services, including Polygon, a Polygon Labs spokesperson confirmed to Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow could it be possible, even theoretically, for someone to stake BTC\u2014actual BTC, not a wrapped token that utilizes a blockchain bridge\u2014on a proof-of-stake network? Proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum utilize smart contracts to govern the staking process, which rewards users who deposit a certain amount of ETH with rewards accrued over time.\n\nIn return, these ETH deposits are used to validate transactions on the Ethereum network. The entire staking process represents an intricate web of if/then conditions executed automatically by a smart contract.\n\nSmart contracts, however, are not natively supported on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014but Babylon says it\u2019s found a workaround.\n\nThe solution relies in part on Bitcoin\u2019s \u201ctime lock\u201d mechanism, which allows users to deposit a certain amount of BTC for a certain period, then withdraw it after that period without depending on a third party. But Babylon also had to find a way to get around the pesky smart contract problem.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge for staking is that the stake is a collateral,\u201d David Tse, an engineering professor at Stanford who co-founded Babylon, told Decrypt. \u201cIn other words, I have to be able to slash the Bitcoin when the validator on the proof-of-stake chain is doing something bad.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTypically, a smart contract would either release collateralized funds to a staker if all conditions were met, or burn (or slash) those funds if they hadn\u2019t been. Tse says his team has been able to replicate that process on the Bitcoin network without smart contracts.\n\n\u201cWe came up with a way to use the existing Bitcoin scripting language to effect the slashing,\u201d Tse said. \u201cThat is the main innovation of the project.\u201d\n\nIf Tse and his team have in fact gotten this right\u2014he says they still have a bit of final tweaking to do on the technology\u2014then the potential upside is enormous.\n\nProof-of-stake blockchains of all sorts could tap into the $838 billion worth of incredibly secure Bitcoin already in circulation to validate their transactions. That innovation would be an all-but-certain path to deflation for any proof-of-stake network, that would no longer have to issue so many new tokens in order to incentivize validation.\n\n\u201cThe Cosmos hub is paying about 10%\u2014inflating the token 10%\u2014to pay for Cosmos\u2019 security,\u201d Tse said, giving an example. \u201cBy bringing in Bitcoin, it can potentially lower the cost of security quite a bit, because Bitcoin is a much larger supply of capital.\u201d\n\nBabylon won\u2019t be able to provide its technology to any given proof-of-stake blockchain ecosystem until that blockchain\u2019s governance gives consent. So, at the moment, the company\u2019s vision is still theoretical.\n\nBut Babylon is, as mentioned above, currently in serious conversations with major proof-of-stake blockchains like Polygon\u2014and also has already received the blessing of industry leaders including Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal.\n\n\u201cBabylon's vision aligns with our commitment to fostering decentralized ecosystems by offering diverse options for communities to seamlessly choose from,\u201d Nailwal said in a statement. \u201cWe are enthusiastic about the positive impact this collaboration will bring to the wider blockchain community.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf (or when) proof-of-stake networks like Polygon begin adopting Babylon\u2019s novel technology, they may create new parameters for what it means to stake BTC on their chain as opposed to the network\u2019s native token.\n\nEthereum, for example, may not require the minimum amount of BTC needed to stake on the network to equal 32 ETH, the system\u2019s current requirement. It might also elect to offer a lower rewards return rate for BTC stakers.\n\nEven if proof-of-stake networks that eventually work with Babylon opt to make such choices, though, the demand for receiving any sort of passive, guaranteed return on Bitcoin will likely be immensely attractive to BTC holders around the world.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Blockstream targets continued Bitcoin miner surplus with Series 2 BASIC Note - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Blockstream will look to raise more capital to buy Bitcoin (BTC) mining hardware through a second series of its Blockstream ASIC (BASIC) Note offering, which aims to accumulate and sell ASICs based on the predicted demand for miners over the next two years.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Cointelegraph, Blockstream CEO Adam Back highlighted a surplus of Bitcoin mining hardware on the secondary market as a critical driver for a second series of its investment offering.\n\nSeries 1 sells out\n\nBlockstream wound up an initial $5-million raise, which saw the firm purchase unused, boxed Antminer S19k Pro ASIC miners for $4.87 million. The company managed to secure the hardware, one of the Chinese manufacturer\u2019s most popular miners, through SunnySide Digital.\n\n\u201cIt presents an opportunity because the Bitcoin price is up 2.8 times, and the miner price is down. Regarding a reference point, ASICs were selling at $35 per terahash at the beginning of the year and now $13.5 per TH on this purchase,\u201d Back explained.\n\nRelated: Perfect storm for undervalued ASICs: Blockstream plans $50M raise to buy miners\n\nThe CEO added that ASIC prices are down 2.6 times their dollar cost from January 2023 and 6.6 times in Bitcoin. The latter is what matters to Back, who said Blockstream will store the hardware in warehouses and sell it on the market as miners look to bring more hardware online as profitability increases alongside the projected upside value of Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cThe fund is not looking for the highest dollar price for the miner; it is looking for the highest Bitcoin price for the miner.\u201d\n\nBlockstream bought Antminer S19k Pro ASIC miners on Nov. 29 for a weighted dollar average of $38,596 per BTC. Source: Blockstream/Luxor data\n\n\u201cAccidental beneficiaries\u201d of BASIC Note\u2019s strategy\n\nTiming the sale of miners is another consideration altogether, which will have to factor in several metrics. One potential tipping point could be the reduction of available miners on second-hand markets. Back said this will force buyers to go directly to manufacturers, driving the price per terahash of units to rise.\n\nBlockstream experienced this firsthand in 2021 when it acquired miners for its hosting service. However, the company ran out of capacity to run the hardware for clients and eventually sold some surplus miners for \u201cthree to four times\u201d higher than it had bought the miners.\n\nRelated: Blockstream CEO Adam Back talks Bitcoin over a game of Jenga\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t our plan to get into the miner reselling game, but we had more inventory than hosting, so we sold off the surplus. That opened our eyes to this dynamic between ASIC and Bitcoin prices,\u201d Back explained.\n\nThe Bitcoin bull run effect\n\nBecoming \u201caccidental beneficiaries\u201d of the strategy underpinning the BASIC Note also highlights the importance of the \u201ctime value\u201d of money and why the price of Bitcoin remains crucial in selling Bitcoin mining hardware for profit.\n\nThe BASIC Note is a #bitcoin-denominated vehicle that leverages Blockstream's expertise in the Bitcoin mining sector to capitalize on historically low ASIC prices and the promising signs of recovery, anchored by the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024.https://t.co/mx9QJ9STun \u2014 Blockstream (@Blockstream) December 13, 2023\n\nBack explained that miners typically buy hardware for a dollar amount and calculate how much Bitcoin they can mine from that point. However, one has to factor in shipping times from a manufacturer, which means that the investment only begins to generate value once it arrives and is powered up.\n\n\u201cWe said to people, \u2018You can pay the manufacturer $60 a terahash, for example, but you\u2019ll lose $50 waiting for it to arrive. Or you can pay us $100 per terahash. That\u2019s a win for you because we can give it to you immediately,\u2019\u201d Back said.\n\nRelated: Venture capital\u2019s ICO gambits left Bitcoin ecosystem underfunded \u2014 Adam Back\n\nThe Blockstream CEO said that previous Bitcoin bull runs have resulted in situations where the electricity cost of mining drastically drops in percentage due to the increase in BTC\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cThe profit is like three times higher when the price doubles. In that situation, people go from being willing to pay $30 to $40 per terahash to being willing to pay between $100 to $130 per terahash, which is what happened last year,\u201d Back recalled.\n\nThis presents the \u201ctail end\u201d opportunity to sell Bitcoin mining hardware that Blockstream has acquired.\n\nBASIC Note will be reactive going forward\n\nBlockstream\u2019s BASIC Note Series 2 offering will likely be reactive to market conditions and demand from investors. Back noted that gauging how much hardware is available to buy on secondary markets is not so clear-cut despite depressed prices suggesting a surplus of inventory.\n\nLuxembourg-based security tokens platform STOKR will manage the second series, which is set to go live around the turn of the new year. The product is available to accredited non-United States investors and requires a minimum $115,000 investment paid in BTC, Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC) or Tether (USDT).\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin 2023 in Miami comes to grips with \u2018shitcoins on Bitcoin\u2019"

Were those funds to exit the market rather than moving into other Bitcoin instruments, it would put \u201csevere downward pressure\u201d on the price of Bitcoin, analysts said.\n\nJP Morgan and crypto\n\nThe JP Morgan report comes just a week after the firms\u2019 CEO, Jamie Dimon, took aim at crypto in a Senate Banking Committee hearing, saying that he would \u201cclose it down\u201d if he were the U.S. government.\n\nDimon claimed that, \u201cThe true use case for it [crypto] is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance,\u201d adding that, \u201cI\u2019ve always been opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etcetera.\u201d"

According to the platform\u2019s website, Bitcoin 360 AI is completely free to use and is capable of trading 24 hours a day.\n\nSo, is Bitcoin 360 AI a scam or legit? We\u2019ll cover everything traders need to know about this platform in our Bitcoin 360 AI review.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI Reviews Summary\n\nLet\u2019s get started with a quick rundown of the key features we found as part of our Bitcoin 360 AI review.\n\nMinimum Deposit $250 Claimed Success Rate Not stated Supported Cryptocurrencies BTC, ETH, BCH, BNB, LTC, DASH, and more Mobile App? Yes Withdrawal or Deposit Fees None Customer Service Phone, email Accepts Fiat Currencies? USD Withdrawal Period Instant for crypto, 12-24 hours for fiat Supports Automated Trading? Yes Offers Leverage? Not stated\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin 360 AI?\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin 360 AI website, this platform is an automated crypto trading system.\n\nIt claims to be able to identify potentially profitable technical setups in the price charts for dozens of popular crypto tokens. Once identified, Bitcoin 360 claims that it can execute a trade from start to finish automatically on a trader\u2019s behalf.\n\nThis means that traders don\u2019t have to do much in order to trade with Bitcoin 360 AI. According to Bitcoin 360 AI, traders do not need to spend all day researching trades or even monitoring the system. Bitcoin 360 AI can operate on its own without any oversight or manual intervention.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI\u2019s website does not provide any information about the trading software\u2019s historical success rate or the accuracy of its trade identification. This is not uncommon among automated crypto trading platforms, as many prefer to keep the details of their proprietary trading algorithms secret.\n\nHowever, the platform claims to offer a demo account, which traders can use to test out Bitcoin 360 AI without risking any of their own money. Traders are encouraged to take advantage of the demo account to learn how to use the platform effectively before risking real money.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin 360 AI\u2019s website states that the platform is completely free to use. Traders must make a minimum deposit of $250, money that is used to start trading cryptocurrencies on a user\u2019s behalf.\n\nAccording to the site, Bitcoin 360 AI does not charge deposit or withdrawal fees or even take commissions on successful trades.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI Pros & Cons\n\nHere are the main benefits and drawbacks of the Bitcoin 360 AI app, according to the claims made on its website.\n\nPros:\n\nClaims to automate crypto trades for dozens of popular tokens\n\nAlgorithm can trade 24/7 according to the website\n\nNo deposit, withdrawal, or trading fees according to the website\n\nClaims to offer a demo account\n\nClaims to offer 24/7 customer support\n\nCons:\n\nDoes not provide information about the historical success rate\n\nRequires a $250 minimum deposit\n\nHow Does Bitcoin 360 AI Work?\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin 360 AI website, the platform uses artificial intelligence (AI) in order to detect profitable trading setups in the crypto market. While the details of its AI algorithm are not revealed, it is likely that the algorithm has been trained on several years\u2019 worth of crypto price data. Using this data, the algorithm can learn what price patterns often precede large upward or downward price movements.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI claims that it uses the money within traders\u2019 accounts to place live trades once it recognizes a signal pattern. The platform opens a position according to the direction of the signal. It then automatically closes it at some point, likely based on a profit target, stop loss, or another price pattern for that signal.\n\nAccording to the platform\u2019s website, traders\u2019 money is then returned to their accounts along with any profit. Bitcoin 360 AI can then use the money again to place additional trades. Traders can withdraw funds from their accounts at any time with no withdrawal fees.\n\nThe Bitcoin 360 AI website does not provide information about the likelihood of success or the past win rate for trades that its system has executed.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI Key Features\n\nOur Bitcoin 360 AI review identified several key features of this platform, according to the claims made by the platform\u2019s developers.\n\nDozens of Crypto Markets\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin 360 AI website, this automated trading platform is capable of trading dozens of top crypto tokens. Those include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Binance Coin, Dash, and many more. It is not clear if Bitcoin 360 AI trades the tokens directly or trades through crypto CFDs, which are offered by many brokers.\n\nTrading multiple cryptocurrencies can be advantageous because they provide more opportunities to trade. In addition, not all coins move in the same direction at the same time, creating opportunities to hedge against the market overall.\n\nDemo Trading Account\n\nBitcoin 360 AI claims to offer a demo trading account that traders can activate at any time. This account enables traders to monitor the platform\u2019s trades and profit or loss without risking real money. It can be a good way for traders to evaluate Bitcoin 360 AI and learn how to use the platform safely.\n\nTraders must create a Bitcoin 360 AI account in order to access the demo trading platform.\n\nBeginner-friendly\n\nBitcoin 360 AI app claims that its platform can be used by any traders, including beginners who have never previously traded cryptocurrencies.

This is important since traders need to trust that they can make deposits and withdrawals to the platform securely.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI Fees\n\nBitcoin 360 AI claims to be completely free to use. According to the platform\u2019s website, there are no deposit or withdrawal fees, no commissions on trades, and no account fees.
