        "content": "VR Test\n\nTable 2 shows the VR test results for the daily log Bitcoin price series. The random walk hypothesis is partially rejected under the homoscedasticity assumption. Specifically, there is mixed evidence: the log of Bitcoin\u2019s price series follows the EMH in the long-run (\\(\\mathrm{VR}(q)\\approx 1\\)) in line with previous literature12,44,45, while it appears to have a mean-reverting property (\\(\\mathrm{VR}\\left(q\\right)<1\\)) in the short-run which is consistent with Corbet and Katsiampa46.\n\nTable 2 VR test results on the log price series of Bitcoin. Variance ratios for holding periods 2, 4, 8, and 16 are tested under the homoscedasticity assumption. ** and *** indicate significance at the 1% and 0.1% levels, respectively. Full size table\n\nTo ensure the adequacy of the VR test, it must hold that the innovations of log price series, that is, the log return series, are Gaussian white noise. However, several previous studies have shown that power law emerges in the tail distribution of Bitcoin\u2019s return series47,48,49,50. Accordingly, we conduct normality tests on the residuals of random walk specification. Table 3 indicates that the null hypothesis, the innovations of the log price series are normally distributed, is rejected at the 1% significance level for the two test statistics such as Jarque\u2013Bera and Shapiro\u2013Wilk tests regardless of sampling intervals. This indicates that the VR test is limited, requiring another approach.\n\nTable 3 Normality test results on the log return distribution of Bitcoin. Jarque\u2013Bera test is run by \\({\\chi }^{2}\\) statistic, and Shapiro\u2013Wilk test is by \\(W\\) statistic. The cutoff values for \\(W\\) are calculated through Monte-Carlo simulations. *** indicates significance at the 0.1% level. The sampling interval q is applied differently to the same data. Full size table\n\nQHO\n\nBefore testing the market efficiency through the QHO, we investigate whether the QHO clearly explains the log return distribution of Bitcoin. Here, we divide the overall sample period into two sub-periods, i.e., low and high price regimes, as the dynamics of Bitcoin price appear differently due to the significant difference in its price level51. The low price regime extends from September 1, 2010, to February 26, 2013, and the high price regime spans from February 27, 2013, to March 31, 2019. Figures 1 (a) and (c) show the histograms of log returns in the Bitcoin market and the PDFs estimated from (i) the QHO and (ii) the random walk model (RWM) in the two regimes. Figures 1 (b) and (d) display the quantile\u2013quantile (Q\u2013Q) plots for the residuals of each model. The PDFs estimated by the QHO fit well, while those by the RWM significantly underestimate the data at the zone near zero, regardless of the price regimes. This is confirmed through two goodness of fit tests, i.e., Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov and Cramer-von Mises tests (Table 4). Moreover, the likelihood-ratio (LR) test compares the goodness of fit of two competing models based on the ratio of their likelihoods and further elaborates that the QHO describes the data better (Table 5).\n\nFigure 1 Model estimation results. Panels (a) and (c) plot the PDFs of each estimated model in the low and high price regimes, respectively. Panels (b) and (d) describe Q\u2013Q plots for the residuals of each model by standardized normal order, plotted with a regression line, in both regimes. Both models are estimated using a daily sampling interval (q = 1). Outliers that deviate from the mean by more than \\(2.58\\times \\mathrm{Std}.\\mathrm{ Err}.\\) are excluded. Full size image\n\nTable 4 The goodness of fit test results on the log return distributions of Bitcoin derived from QHO and RWM. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test is run by \\(D\\) and Cramer-von Mises test is by \\(T\\) statistics. The cutoff values for \\(T\\) statistics are calculated through Monte-Carlo simulations. In the test, outliers that deviate from the mean by more than \\(2.58\\times \\mathrm{Std}.\\mathrm{ Err}.\\) are excluded. The numbers in parentheses are p-values of the statistics, where *** represents significance at the 0.1% level. Full size table\n\nTable 5 LR test results. The LR test assesses the adequacy of the QHO model over RWM where outliers that deviate from the mean by more than \\(2.58\\times \\mathrm{Std}.\\mathrm{ Err}.\\) are excluded. The result indicates that the QHO (unrestricted) model explains the data better than the RWM (restricted) model. The formula of the LR test statistic is \\(LR=-2\\mathrm{log}({L}_{r}/{L}_{u})\\) , where \\({L}_{u}\\) and \\({L}_{r}\\) denote the likelihood of the respective models such as QHO and RWM. The test statistic follows \\({\\chi }^{2}\\) distribution with the degree of freedom (d.f.) 3, which refers to the number of constrained parameters. The p-value indicates that the unrestricted model outperforms the restricted model. Full size table\n\nIn Table 6, the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) show that the PDFs derived from the QHO (mixture \\(\\chi\\) distribution) have smaller errors than those from the RWM (Gaussian distribution) in both price regimes. This is because the solution of the QHO is a generalized solution of the RWM, capturing both Gaussian and non-Gaussian features together. Particularly, the QHO includes market uncertainty through the properties of superimposed wave functions and assumes that the resilience of the harmonic oscillator reflects the restoring force that drives market return to the long-run equilibrium26: market friction is reflected in the stochastic differential equation.\n\nTable 6 Prediction errors of the log return distributions of Bitcoin derived from the QHO and RWM. Each estimated value is calculated based on the daily interval. Full size table\n\nTable 7 summarizes the estimated probabilities assigned to the first three low-lying eigenstates (\\(n=0, 1, 2)\\) for Bitcoin in both regimes as well as in the overall sample period (Those for the benchmarks in the overall sample period are shown in the supplementary information). Each eigenstate of the QHO model is described as a \\(\\chi\\) distribution, and the probability \\({P}_{n}\\) assigned to each represents a value of the probability assigned to each \\(\\chi\\) distribution26. The state of \\(n=3\\) and higher is neglected because the values assigned to \\({P}_{n}\\) are less than \\({10}^{-4}\\). The result is presented along with daily (\\(q=1\\)) and other different holding periods (\\(q=2, 4, 8, 16\\)). Particularly, since a market is efficient when the log return distribution is close to the Gaussian distribution, it can be said that the Bitcoin market follows the EMH based on the value of \\({P}_{0}\\): that is, the probability allocation in the Gaussian distribution that describes the ground state of the QHO model. Unlike the mixed evidence of the VR test, the result of QHO consistently supports the efficiency of the Bitcoin market: the log of Bitcoin price follows a random walk with a probability of 90% or more.\n\nTable 7 Probability assigned to each eigenstate in the Bitcoin market. The holding period ( \\(q\\) ) reflects the \\(q\\) th difference of the log price data as \\({x}_{t}=252.5/q \\left(\\mathrm{ln}{p}_{t}-\\mathrm{ln}{p}_{t-q}\\right).\\) Full size table\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur results are explained through market capitalization and the speed of information discovery. Table 8 shows that the \\(m\\omega\\) value of Bitcoin is much smaller with the scale being about 1/19 to 1/47 than that of other assets (e.g., commodity, stock, and currency). According to Ahn et al.26, \\(m\\) can be interpreted as the market capitalization and \\(\\omega\\) as the angular velocity for log return fluctuations. The average market capitalization (\\(m\\)) of Bitcoin in 2010\u20132019 is about 1/321 and 1/648 of the gold and S&P 500, respectively. Thus, the oscillating velocity around the equilibrium (\\(\\omega\\)) for Bitcoin is estimated about 17 and 25 times larger than those for the gold and S&P 500, respectively. It implies that information circulation in the Bitcoin market is sufficiently fast compared to others, confirming the efficiency of the Bitcoin market together with the probability assigned to the ground state.\n\nTable 8 Market capitalization and the speed of information discovery. The \\(m\\omega\\) values are estimated through the QHO model. Market capitalization represents the average daily market capitalization during the sample period. The daily market capitalization of Bitcoin and S&P 500 is retrieved from Quandl.com and the Center for Research in Security Prices, respectively. The daily market capitalization of gold is estimated by multiplying daily gold prices with the yearly above-ground gold reserves provided by World Gold Council. As the definition of market capitalization of USD/EUR is ambiguous, we have not directly made a comparison with the \\(\\omega\\) of USD/EUR. The period of data collection was from September 10, 2010, to March 31, 2019. To match the sample period of Bitcoin and that of the other assets, we extract daily data excluding the holidays for Bitcoin. Full size table\n\nWe estimate the probability assigned to the first three low-lying eigenstates for each year. Figure 2 shows that the yearly \\({P}_{0}\\) value fluctuates over the 90% level. This further confirms the robustness of our results: there is no significant change in the pattern of probability allocation at the ground state by year. This implies that technical analysis of historical price series cannot provide a long-term advantage in the Bitcoin market; future price evolution will be based on new information rather than past price performance. However, the \\({P}_{0}\\) values in 2013 and 2017 fell to around 88% and 87%, respectively. On the one hand, the decrease in 2013 is regarded as the transition period, shifting the Bitcoin market from a low to a high price regime51. The Bitcoin price, which had been in the tens of US dollars, exceeded USD 1,000 per BTC and burst a market bubble52: in December 2013, the Bitcoin price surged to USD 1,147 per BTC, then plunged by up to 85% in the following year. Moreover, in 2013, Bitcoin production (mined volume) drastically decreased due to increased mining difficulty. This significantly affected the price of Bitcoin on the supply side53. Put differently, during the transition period of the price regime, the strong collective phenomenon together with supply shortage resulted in a decline in the efficiency of the Bitcoin market; the \\({P}_{0}\\) value supports these arguments well.\n\nFigure 2 Yearly change of the probability allocation in each eigenstate in the Bitcoin market. The black dashed line shows the probability assigned to the ground state (\\({P}_{0}\\)) while the blue dash-single dotted line and red dotted line describe the probabilities assigned to the first (\\({P}_{1}\\)) and second excited state (\\({P}_{2}\\)), respectively. Two shaded areas indicate the periods when \\({P}_{0}\\) value is estimated below 0.9. Full size image\n\nHowever, in 2017, there was a large increase of public interest in cryptocurrencies, which caused higher levels of uncertainty and induced herding behavior in cryptocurrency markets54. Bouri et al.55 statistically confirmed this by showing that significant herding frequently occurred in 2017 in cryptocurrency markets. Accordingly, in line with Froot et al.56, the decreased \\({P}_{0}\\) value in 2017 can be explained as follows: many short-term speculators who are new to cryptocurrency herd in the Bitcoin market based on information completely irrelevant to fundamentals. Meanwhile, this increase in irrational speculation was mainly derived from China\u2019s cryptocurrency exchange market which at that time accounted for more than 90% of the global cryptocurrency trading volume. Accordingly, the People\u2019s Bank of China banned domestic cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings in September 2017, followed by a drastic cryptocurrency price drop and resurgence a few days after57. Nonetheless, after these strict regulations were imposed, most of the trading volume of cryptocurrencies in China moved elsewhere (e.g., U.S., Japan, and South Korea) and their impact on cryptocurrency prices was ambiguous58. This implies that such strict regulations in cryptocurrencies would not be effective but just increase price uncertainty, affecting their market efficiency, which can also explain the low \\({P}_{0}\\) value in 2017.\n\nLiquidity increments in the Bitcoin market positively affect market efficiency; particularly, liquidity change plays a central role in the return predictability and, thus, informational efficiency of cryptocurrencies16,18. Generally, liquidity increase improves market efficiency through two channels59,60: first, it enables faster and cheaper transactions, thereby price promptly absorbs available information in the marketplace; second, it encourages investors to easily make tiny- or short-term massive transactions based on private information that barely impacts prices, approximating the market prices to fundamental asset value61,62,63. Therefore, we examine the Amihud illiquidity ratio64 and explain the market efficiency of Bitcoin with the changes in liquidity: Fig. 3 shows that the Bitcoin market\u2019s liquidity keeps increasing gradually, even surpassing the USD/EUR and gold since 2014.\n\nFigure 3 Amihud illiquidity of the Bitcoin, gold, S&P 500, and USD/EUR markets. Following Amihud 63, the monthly illiquidity is estimated using the daily history of trades. The smaller the calculated illiquidity value, the greater the liquidity of the market. The red, yellow, blue, and green lines indicate Amihud illiquidity of the Bitcoin, gold, S&P 500, and USD/EUR markets, respectively. Each colored line is expressed on a log scale for comparison purposes, using data available from September 2010 to March 2019. The shaded area indicates the period of the low-price regime. The trading volume for each asset were retrieved from the following websites: https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets (Bitcoin), https://backtestmarket.com (gold), https://finance.yahoo.com (S&P 500), and https://www.fxcm.com/markets (USD/EUR). Full size image\n\nUnlike other assets, Bitcoin has a unique market structure where inelastic supply meets elastic demand since the total issuance (mining volume) is predetermined. Therefore, investors\u2019 reaction to market information has a huge impact on Bitcoin prices. Additionally, year-round 24/7 trading, relatively low transaction costs, and low entry barriers to the market help investors participate freely and make decisions promptly, ultimately facilitating quick information dissemination in the market price. This explains how the Bitcoin market was able to operate close to an efficient market even with a low liquidity level in the early stage, especially during the low price regime in 2010\u20132012. However, since 2013, the market has stabilized with the birth of multiple exchanges and institutional investors\u2019 interests. Accordingly, the liquidity of the Bitcoin market continued to expand, which has further contributed to market efficiency in the high price regime. Thus, negative factors that inhibit the efficient dissemination of information in the market, such as instability of the initial market system, early government regulations, externalities like hacking, and highly speculative transactions, appear to be offset by the development of the Bitcoin market."

        "title": "Crypto Is Mostly Over. Its Carbon Emissions Are Not. - The Atlantic",
        "content": "Sign up for The Weekly Planet, The Atlantic\u2019s newsletter about living through climate change, here.\n\nAt this point, for most of us, cryptocurrency seems like nothing more than a fad. After the FTX bankruptcy and broader crypto crash last year, basically all of the celebrities who were promoting crypto have gone silent. \u201cMiamiCoin,\u201d hyped by Miami Mayor Francis Suarez as a new source of income for the city, is now worthless. The Wild West days of the industry may be over. Recently, the head of the SEC warned crypto firms to \u201cdo their work within the bounds of the law\u201d or face enforcement actions. Lots of people lost money in the crash, but from the planet\u2019s perspective, the industry\u2019s downfall is good news: The computing power fueling the crypto boom was so substantial that it was causing substantial greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nAnd yet crypto\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions are still shockingly high, according to an industry tracker run by the University of Cambridge. The tracker focuses on bitcoin, the cryptocurrency with by far the largest market share, and estimates that at its current rate of \u201cmining\u201d new coins, bitcoin will release about 62 megatons of \u201ccarbon-dioxide equivalent\u201d each year\u2014about as much as the entire country of Serbia emitted in 2019. That\u2019s up from about 43 megatons a year in December, and just slightly below the all-time peak of nearly 74 in May 2021. Many people who\u2019ve invested in crypto tend to have a lot of sunk costs, whether digital wallets bulging with various coins, tokens, or expensive physical setups designed to make more. Even now that the boom times are over, they have no reason to stop.\n\nMining bitcoin does not involve actually digging anything out of the ground\u2014unless you count the fossil fuel that often powers it. The process involves using heavy-duty computers to grind through trillions of calculations, solving equations to create virtual coins. The method is known as \u201cproof of work.\u201d Once upon a time, bitcoin mining was something that people did if they had a couple of spare computers they wanted to put to work. Over time, it\u2019s taken more and more computing power to unlock a single coin; now most mining is done in large-scale operations using purpose-built mining rigs.\n\nAnd it is America\u2019s problem now. After China clamped down on crypto mining in 2021, such computing work increased in the United States. Miners set up shop in communities with low energy prices. And owners of unprofitable power-generation infrastructure, such as waste-coal-burning power plants, opened up crypto-mining operations to create another revenue stream. These companies have put a lot of money into their hardware and their physical space, and they will continue mining until they are actively losing money. \u201cThere are miners that have been quoted saying, \u2018As long as the price is over $10,000 per coin, it still can generate money,\u2019\u201d Elizabeth Moran, a policy advocate at the green law firm Earthjustice, told me. And that is a big reason crypto keeps spewing out so many emissions even during the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d: Bitcoin prices in particular have held up, in fact they just passed $28,000 a coin. That\u2019s still far below their peak of almost $68,000 in late 2021, but represents a bit of a comeback from the sub-$16,000 prices of last fall.\n\nSo it is still very possible to make money at this game. Some companies bypass the energy grid entirely; depending on the price of gas and the price of bitcoin, turning natural gas into crypto might be twice as profitable as selling it to the wholesale gas market. Gas companies bring in a trailer or three jam-packed with generators, plugging one end into the well and the other into \u201cshipping containers full of bitcoin miners,\u201d says Rob Altenburg, the senior director for energy and climate at PennFuture, an environmental nonprofit. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of three different companies doing it. But we\u2019ve got thousands of fracked gas wells across the state and just simply have no way of knowing where this is happening.\u201d Gas drilling is heavily regulated, but crypto mining itself is not.\n\nA recent federal investigation in Colorado found crypto mining powered by gas wells on public-lease lands, creaming energy off before it hit the grid and converting it to crypto without paying any royalties. The report noted that because the generators and rigs are usually on trailers, the entire operation can be moved quickly, so miners can stay ahead of government oil and gas inspectors. Other \u201cbehind-the-meter\u201d operations are physically located at power plants. The natural-gas-fired Greenidge Generation Station, on the shores of Seneca Lake in upstate New York, opened a massive bitcoin-mining operation plugged right into the plant, which in 2021 consumed the bulk of the electricity it produced. Tapping into energy before it hits the grid is just one way bitcoin miners keep costs down; they\u2019ll seek out and exploit any cheap source of energy.\n\nCrypto doesn\u2019t have to torch the planet. The second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, switched to a different method of creating its tokens in September 2022. The new approach, called \u201cproof of stake,\u201d uses significantly less computing power, so much so that after the switch, the company\u2019s total energy consumption dropped 99.95 percent. \u201cIt is impossible for bitcoin to switch to proof of stake, because the bitcoin network is completely decentralized,\u201d Kyle Schneps, the director of public policy at Foundry, a major mining financier, told me. \u201cThere is no governing body that could make such a decision.\u201d\n\nRenewables could also power bitcoin mining, just like they power anything else. Maybe as much as 38 percent of bitcoin mining is currently powered by renewables, according to the Cambridge tracker, though no one really knows. But that hasn\u2019t gone up since the crypto winter. Schneps said that bitcoin mining could help with the energy transition: Renewable-energy companies can always sell their energy to bitcoin miners when demand is otherwise low, keeping them profitable enough to stay in business and grow. But it\u2019s not clear if mining operations that run only at certain times would be profitable.\n\nFor now, bitcoin will remain an albatross on the planet at just the moment that the energy transition ramps up. Cambridge predicts that its environmental impact in 2023 will be worse than it was in 2022. The Super Bowl ads and awkward late-night celebrity endorsements may be gone, but crypto is not dead. Still embraced by true believers and international criminals, the hard drives grind on, in shipping containers and empty warehouses and back lots of power plants, endlessly calculating, spinning money out of carbon and faith.\n\nLots of other digital activities do consume power and cause greenhouse-gas emissions\u2014questing with pals, hoarding years of work emails on the cloud, making friends with a hallucinating AI. One analysis in 2019 suggested that our online lives were responsible for 3.7 percent of planet-wide emissions; the number may have gone up since. Schneps likened bitcoin\u2019s global electricity consumption to \u201croughly the same as video games.\u201d But even if that\u2019s true, while two-thirds of Americans play video games, just 21 percent of Americans own crypto, and even less bitcoin in particular. The massive environmental impact of bitcoin is harder to swallow because it is part of an industry that is, in essence, \u201csmoke and mirrors,\u201d as the crypto blogger James Block put it in an interview with Charlie Warzel. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing produced by these companies.\u201d\n\nFinance experts around the world largely agree with Block. In December, a director-general at the European Central Bank, Ulrich Bindseil, called for serious financial institutions to stop legitimizing cryptocurrency, saying bitcoin was \u201cnot suitable as an investment.\u201d If the world is going to continue to burn fossil fuels, it makes sense to do so for things that genuinely contribute to people\u2019s well-being, not for risky virtual tokens untethered to any real thing of value in the world."

The skull is made with electronic waste donated by Unirecycle, representing the millions of computers used to validate Bitcoin transactions, known as mining.\n\nThe Skull of Satoshi symbolizes the enormous climate impact of bitcoin mining and serves as an avatar to encourage financial institutions to take responsibility for the climate impact of Bitcoin investments, products, and services they offer.\n\nGreenpeace Campaigner Rolf Skar said: \u201cCoal-fired power plants are being revived and kept alive by the growing electricity demands of Bitcoin mining. This is a horrifying development, given the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels to prevent a climate catastrophe. Our skull design serves as a powerful symbol, urging financial institutions to use their influence to advocate for a code change that could reduce Bitcoin\u2019s electricity usage by a whopping 99%. We cannot afford to expand our reliance on fossil fuels any further, and it\u2019s up to the Bitcoin community to take action and change their code \u2013 not the climate \u2013 if we hope to secure a sustainable future for all.\u201d\n\nFinancial companies like Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and Blackrock that have climate goals and invest in Bitcoin and offer Bitcoin products can use their influence to call for a code change to create a more energy efficient consensus mechanism.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions rivaling that of countries like Ireland and Chile, Greenpeace and Von Wong are calling on the companies to push Bitcoin to change its code to one that isn\u2019t electricity-intensive, greatly reducing its climate pollution and environmental impact on local communities living near mining facilities.\n\nArtist Benjamin Von Wong said: \u201cAs an artist and activist, I believe in the power of art to spark conversations and inspire change. The idea that we have the unique opportunity to erase the climate footprint equivalent of an entire country by fixing Bitcoin is so exciting to me.\n\n\u201cThe crypto community has some of the brightest minds, and I have no doubt that if we can generate enough demand for a more sustainable Bitcoin that some genius can come up with a solution that works for all people and the planet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to see what Greenpeace does with this art installation and to play a small part in the global transformation necessary!\u201d\n\nWatch the making of the Skull of Satoshi to see the artistic process behind this powerful installation and learn more about the environmental impact of bitcoin mining.\n\nSkull of Satoshi Arrives in New York City\n\nNext week, Greenpeace will be taking the Skull of Satoshi on an accountability tour, bringing attention to financial institutions that are investing heavily into Bitcoin. The tour seeks to spark a conversation and encourage the financial industry to encourage Bitcoin to change the code, not the climate.

Ether fell 4.1% to $1,726.58, following a big move higher on Tuesday.\n\nThe Fed enacted a quarter percentage point interest rate increase at the conclusion of its latest policy meeting, expressing caution about the recent banking crisis and indicating that hikes are nearing an end. Fed projections call for just one more hike this year.\n\nA 25 basis point increase was widely anticipated. The decision makes it the ninth consecutive interest rate hike and the second quarter-point increase in a row after a series of bigger rate hikes were implemented throughout 2022.\n\n\"The hope was that the long-awaited dovish tone from the Fed would finally arrive in the midst of this banking crisis. Those hopes were dashed by Powell's comments that rate hikes could continue as long as things continued to stabilize, weakening some of the momentum that has been leading crypto's rise in recent days,\" said Michael Safai at the crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital.\n\n\"A lot of what has driven the latest bitcoin rally \u2013 the ongoing weakness in the banking system and the potential for increases in central bank balance sheets \u2013 hasn't disappeared completely,\" he added. \"This could provide a floor for cryptocurrencies once the broader institutional reaction to the Fed settles down.\""

        "title": "The Institutionalization of Bitcoin: Effects on Price and Adoption - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Bitcoin's rise has been one of the most significant financial events in the last decade. Bitcoin has grown from its humble beginnings as a decentralized, peer-to-peer payment system to a global phenomenon, with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion as of March 2023.\n\nHowever, as Bitcoin has grown in popularity, it has also grown in institutionalization, with large financial institutions and corporations investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In this article, we will look at how institutionalization affects the price and adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Is Institutionalization?\n\nThe process by which a new financial asset or technology is adopted by mainstream financial institutions such as banks, hedge funds, and pension funds is referred to as institutionalization. Increased liquidity, price stability, and broader adoption of the asset or technology can result from institutionalization.\n\nInstitutionalization has taken various forms in the case of Bitcoin. Large financial institutions, such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have begun to offer their clients Bitcoin-related investment products.\n\nKeep Reading Will Blockchain Technology Mark a Turning Point in Fraud Prevention?\n\nBitcoin has been used as a store of value by major corporations such as Tesla and MicroStrategy. Furthermore, regulatory bodies such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have begun to provide guidance on the regulation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Impact of Institutionalization on the Bitcoin Price\n\nBitcoin's price has been significantly influenced by its institutionalization. Bitcoin's price was highly volatile in its early days, with large price swings occurring on a regular basis. However, as more institutional investors have entered the market, the price has stabilized.\n\nA variety of factors have contributed to this increased stability. For starters, institutional investors are typically long-term investors who prioritize portfolio diversification and risk management.\n\nThis means they are less likely to sell their Bitcoin holdings during market volatility, which can help to limit price swings.\n\nFurthermore, institutional investors frequently invest large sums of money in Bitcoin, which can help to keep the price stable. For example, when Tesla announced in February 2021 that it had invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin increased by more than 10% in a single day.\n\nBitcoin's increased stability has also made it a more appealing investment for traditional investors like pension funds and endowments. These investors typically have strict investment policies that require them to invest in low-volatility assets. As Bitcoin becomes more stable, these investors are more likely to consider adding it to their portfolios.\n\nInstitutionalization's Influence on Bitcoin Adoption\n\nBitcoin's institutionalization has also had a significant impact on its adoption. In the early days of Bitcoin, it was primarily used for peer-to-peer transactions by individuals and small businesses. However, as more institutions have entered the market, Bitcoin has begun to gain acceptance as a form of payment.\n\nPayPal, for example, began allowing its users to buy, hold, and sell Bitcoin in late 2020. This move was interpreted as a significant endorsement of Bitcoin by a mainstream financial institution, and it aided in increasing adoption by making it easier for people to buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin's institutionalization has helped to improve its reputation and build trust among mainstream investors. Bitcoin was initially associated with illegal activities, such as money laundering and drug trafficking.\n\nHowever, as more institutions have invested in Bitcoin and regulatory authorities have issued guidance on its use, it has gained acceptance as a legitimate asset.\n\nInstitutionalization's Difficulties\n\nWhile Bitcoin has benefited greatly from institutionalization, it has also presented some challenges. One of the most significant challenges is the possibility of market manipulation by large institutional investors.\n\nIf a small group of investors controls a significant portion of the Bitcoin market, they may be able to manipulate the price by purchasing or selling large amounts of Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, the increased regulatory scrutiny that comes with institutionalization may pose difficulties for Bitcoin. Regulatory authorities may impose restrictions on the use of cryptocurrencies or impose strict reporting requirements on institutions. Institutions that invest in Bitcoin may incur additional costs and administrative burdens as a result of this.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin's increasing centralization may raise concerns about the decentralization that was one of its founding principles. As more institutions become involved in Bitcoin, the risk of it becoming more centralized and controlled by a small group of investors or institutions increases.\n\nWill Institutionalization Correlate with BTC\u2019s Demise?\n\nBitcoin has been the topic of many debates since its inception in 2009. As Bitcoin has gained more attention and popularity, the possibility of its institutionalization has become a growing concern among its supporters.\n\nThe institutionalization of Bitcoin refers to the process of large financial institutions such as banks, hedge funds, and investment firms incorporating Bitcoin into their business models. While some argue that this would increase the adoption and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency, others believe that it would ultimately lead to the end of Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the reasons why the institutionalization of Bitcoin could lead to its demise is because it goes against the core principles of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was created as an alternative to the traditional financial system, which is dominated by large institutions that control the flow of money. By allowing these institutions to incorporate Bitcoin into their business models, it could lead to a concentration of power and influence in the hands of a few players, which would defeat the purpose of decentralization.\n\nAnother reason why the institutionalization of Bitcoin could lead to its downfall is the potential for increased regulation. As Bitcoin becomes more mainstream and widely used, governments may feel compelled to regulate it more heavily. This could lead to restrictions on the use of Bitcoin and make it less attractive to individuals who value its anonymity and lack of government oversight.\n\nFurthermore, the institutionalization of Bitcoin would also likely correlate with increased volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Large financial institutions have a significant amount of power and influence in the financial world, and their participation in the Bitcoin market could lead to rapid fluctuations in its value. This could make it difficult for individuals and businesses to use Bitcoin as a stable store of value or medium of exchange.\n\nLastly, the process could likely lead to the creation of alternative cryptocurrencies that better align with the principles of decentralization. As Bitcoin becomes more mainstream, some individuals may become disillusioned with its institutionalization and seek out alternative cryptocurrencies that are more in line with their values. This could lead to a fragmentation of the cryptocurrency market, which could ultimately weaken Bitcoin's position as the dominant cryptocurrency.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin's price and adoption have been significantly influenced by its institutionalization. Institutional investors have helped to stabilize the market and improve Bitcoin's reputation among mainstream investors.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin has grown in popularity and is increasingly being used as a form of payment.\n\nHowever, institutionalization has brought with it new challenges, such as the possibility of market manipulation and increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\nIt is critical for the Bitcoin community to prioritize decentralization and ensure that the benefits of institutionalization do not come at the expense of the fundamental principles that distinguish Bitcoin.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how institutionalization shapes Bitcoin's development as it evolves and matures. It is clear that institutionalization has had a significant impact on Bitcoin in recent years, but how this will play out in the future remains to be seen."

        "content": "A reward worth almost $2 million in bitcoin may be up for grabs by the end of this year.\n\nAll treasure hunters need to do is find a way to travel more than 200,000 miles through space and then land on the moon\u2019s surface. That\u2019s because later this year a SpaceX rocket will carry a small lunar rover about the size of a microwave oven to the moon. Carefully attached to the rover: A coded key capable of unlocking a small fortune, 62 bitcoin.\n\nRight now, 62 bitcoin equals almost $1.8 million. But by the time someone manages to pull off copying down the key from the rover, the digital treasure could be worth much more, argues one of the project\u2019s leaders.\n\n\u201cMy God, who knows the price of bitcoin in 40 years,\u201d said Joe Vezzani, CEO of LunarCrush, the driving force behind the \u201cfirst interplanetary treasure hunt\u201d in history, a project christened Nakamoto_1, after Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nVezzani runs LunarCrush, a firm that aggregates social media communication in order to analyze investment trends across cryptocurrencies and NFTs. And while the chief executive is no expert in space exploration, he admits the arduous \u2014 if not completely bonkers \u2014 challenge could take even highly motivated explorers several years to overcome.\n\n\n\nBut he and his team are optimistic it won\u2019t take four decades. \u201cPeople have done crazier things,\u201d he said, pointing to all the future lunar projects coming down the pike. \u201cThey\u2019re building bases [on the moon], so at some point there will be people cruising around up there.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Russia, India, China, the EU and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX have all discussed or have planned trips to the moon. Expanded exploration of the lunar surface and the future potential for space stations located there also all appear to be gaining momentum.\n\nWith Nakamoto_1, the rover will first fulfill its duty of testing wireless data transmission along the moon\u2019s South Pole, according to the project\u2019s organizers. \u201c[It] will operate continuously until the end of the lunar day, which lasts 14 Earth Days. Once the sun sets and the communication link to the lander ceases, the rover will remain dormant until it is discovered,\" said Forrest Meyen, co-founder of Lunar Outpost, the company building and outfitting the small rover before it hitches a ride to the moon.\n\nNFT drop\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nFunding the 62-bitcoin fortune begins with the issuing of a 24,000-piece collection of NFTs scheduled to drop later this month. At $250 per NFT, LunarCrush hopes to raise as much as $6 million. The company has earmarked about 25% to pay for the treasure. An additional 25% is also set to be donated to bitcoin-related developmental and educational causes.\n\nTo create the collection art the project enlisted the talents of Emmy-nominated animation studio Golden Wolf, which was recently acquired by the top-tier NFT brand Doodles. Golden Wolf is tasked with helping Doodles expand its franchise and content offerings.\n\nThe entire team, which also includes a Bitcoin developer tools company known as Hiro, comes across as earnest about promoting space travel and spurring ingenuity among wannabe space explorers. But the core mission appears firmly rooted in creating community around the project while generating positive buzz both for LunarCrush and the crypto industry amid a prolonged bear market mired in scandal.\n\nThe bounty\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in the space awhile and we could have built an NFT project before this,\u201d Vezzani said, adding, \u201cover time you\u2019re going to see the project get more interwoven into LunarCrush,\u201d including special benefits to some Nakamoto_1 token holders.\n\nVezzani understands that the project\u2019s success initially hinges on selling enough NFTs to fill a digital wallet full of an amount of bitcoin that will generate interest in the lunar treasure hunt.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the stuff that keeps you up at night,\u201d he said, adding that he believes that it will likely be years before anyone claims the treasure, but that buys his team time to eventually add more bitcoin, or even valuable NFTs, to the digital treasure chest. \u201cPeople can send stuff to that public key forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the part of free markets that work really well,\u201d countered Hiro CEO Alex Miller when asked if the whole endeavor is nothing more than a spectacular publicity stunt. \u201cYou put a bounty out there and you let people figure out the best way to go get it.\u201d"

        "content": "Former Coinbase Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Balaji Srinivasan is betting big on Bitcoin (BTC/USD), predicting the cryptocurrency will hit $1 million by June 17 because of a rapid devaluation of the U.S. dollar.\n\nSrinivasan entered into a $1 million bet via Twitter with two individuals, offering up Circle's USDC stablecoin to pseudonymous Twitter personality James Medlock and another unnamed person if Bitcoin fails to achieve the historic gains he predicts. The bet is part of Srinivasan\u2019s view that the global economy is on the cusp of change, leading to what he calls \"hyperbitcoinization\" and a redenomination of the global economy on Bitcoin as digital gold.\n\nSrinivasan's prediction comes amid a series of bank failures in the U.S. that have injected fear and uncertainty into financial markets. Bitcoin's recent surge past $28,000, outperforming Wall Street bank stocks, has led some on Twitter to call it \"The Great Decoupling.\" The bold bet has sparked lively debates on Twitter, with prominent voices, including Jimmy Song and Adam Cochran, weighing in on its feasibility.\n\nOther startups in the sector have seen increased traction following the blockchain-based rebound. Popular blockchain-based gaming asset platform Gameflip, for example, recently passed $870,000 raised on StartEngine and $160 million in volume traded on the platform.\n\nAlthough Cochran acknowledged that Bitcoin could have utility during an existential crisis for the financial system, he argued that Srinivasan's bet is fueled by an unrealistic hope in a risky macro environment. Cochran posited that a collapse of the U.S. and European banking systems would ultimately overshadow the potential value of Bitcoin as an asset, making bunkers or beans a better use of money than purchasing the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nTo stay updated with top startup investments, sign up for Benzinga\u2019s Startup Investing & Equity Crowdfunding Newsletter\n\nSrinivasan's bet has sparked renewed excitement and hope in the crypto market after a tough 2022, a time when prices plummeted and numerous crypto firms collapsed.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing Srinivasan's bet on Bitcoin's rise to $1 million, Bloomberg's Matt Levine questioned why Srinivasan chose to make the bet instead of simply buying Bitcoin. In response to Levine's tweet, some suggested that Srinivasan may be attempting to manipulate the price of Bitcoin, while others posited that he may be seeking exposure for himself and the cryptocurrency. According to Datawallet, Srinivasan's estimated net worth is around $150 million. He previously co-founded Earn.com, which rewarded users with digital assets for completing small tasks, before it was acquired by Coinbase, where he served as CTO.\n\nOthers share Srinivasan's bold prediction that Bitcoin could reach $1 million in value. Last year, Ark Invest, led by Cathie Wood, also made a similar forecast, estimating that Bitcoin's value could surpass $1 million by 2030.\n\nWood\u2019s prediction was based on the assumption that Bitcoin would continue to gain acceptance among institutional investors, leading to an increase in demand and a subsequent rise in price. Ark Invest is a well-known investment firm that specializes in disruptive innovation, and Wood is one of the most prominent voices in the investment community advocating for Bitcoin.\n\nRead Next: The Tesla Of Lawn Mowers: Soon Your Cars Won't Be Your Only Self-Driving, All-Electric Vehicle\n\nWhile Srinivasan\u2019s prediction of a $1 million Bitcoin price within the next three months is more ambitious than Wood\u2019s, it is not without precedent. Bitcoin has experienced massive price swings in the past, with some investors making fortunes during bull markets. But the cryptocurrency has also been subject to extreme volatility, and it is not uncommon for its price to plummet just as quickly as it rises.\n\nRegardless of whether Srinivasan\u2019s bet pays off, it has generated a lot of attention in the cryptocurrency community. Many people are eager to see whether he will be proven right, and the outcome of his wager could have far-reaching implications for the future of Bitcoin and the wider crypto market.\n\nSee more on startup investing from Benzinga.\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

        "content": "Greenpeace USA and Artist Benjamin Von Wong Join Forces to Highlight Bitcoin\u2019s Climate Problem\n\nArt and activism merge in the striking art installation called the Skull of Satoshi, created by art activist Benjamin Von Wong and Greenpeace USA to highlight Bitcoin\u2019s record of climate destruction.\n\nThe world of Bitcoin might seem intangible, but the reality is that Bitcoin has a very tangible impact on our climate, environment, and communities. We\u2019re in a climate crisis, and right now Bitcoin is part of the problem\u2013but it doesn\u2019t have to be. That is why Greenpeace has teamed up with artist and activist Benjamin Von Wong. Greenpeace campaigner Rolf Skar first met Von Wong while studying the impacts of climate change on the Greenland Ice Sheet. It was there that Skar and Von Wong began talking about Bitcoin\u2019s climate impact and what could be done to address it. Realizing that most people didn\u2019t understand the connection between Bitcoin and the Climate Crisis \u2013 Von Wong and Skar embarked on a creative collaboration to design a visual symbol that could grab attention and support Greenpeace\u2019s campaign to change the code, not the climate. The result is an 11-foot skull covered in E-Waste, complete with Bitcoin Laser Eyes, titled: \u201cThe Skull of Satoshi\u201d.\n\nWhy is Greenpeace calling for Bitcoin to change the code? Because Bitcoin \u201cmining\u201d is causing needless harm to communities and our climate. Bitcoin is the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency and relies on a validation system called Proof of Work (PoW) that uses massive amounts of electricity mostly from climate polluting fossil fuels like coal and gas. In one year, Bitcoin uses as much electricity as the Netherlands and emits over 63 million metric tons of GHG emissions, more than Hungary emits annually.\n\nGreenpeace\u2019s ask to the Bitcoin community is straight-forward: change the code, not the climate. Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, changed to a much more energy-efficient Proof of Stake (PoS) code in September 2022. After changing to a PoS, Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption decreased by 99.95%.\n\nSince Bitcoin is decentralized and has no formal leadership, it is incumbent on those investing in Bitcoin to join the movement to change Bitcoin\u2019s code. That is why we are looking to financial institutions that have large Bitcoin businesses like Fidelity, Blackrock, and Goldman Sachs to stand true to their climate commitments and use their influence to help change Bitcoin\u2019s code, not the climate.\n\nWhy art? Art can be a powerful tool for raising awareness and inspiring action. It has the ability to engage people emotionally, intellectually, and visually in ways that traditional forms of communication may not. This is particularly important with complex issues like the intersection of climate and cryptocurrency.\n\nWe hope that the Skull of Satoshi will be an invitation for people to join the campaign and learn more about Bitcoin and its role in stoking the flames of the climate crisis.\n\nHow does art become activism? Greenpeace will use the Skull of Satoshi as a visual reminder to Bitcoin\u2019s backers in the financial services industry that Bitcoin is damaging communities and our climate. We will demand that financial institutions uphold their climate commitments and ask Bitcoin to change its code.

        "content": "In this article BTC.BS=-USS\n\nBTC.CB=\n\nBTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nBitcoin has rallied nearly 70% so far this year \u2014 and industry insiders who spoke to CNBC remain bullish, with one saying the world's biggest cryptocurrency could reach new heights. Bitcoin previously hit its all-time high of $68,990.90 in November 2021. Since then it has fallen about 60%. Marshall Beard, chief strategy officer at U.S.-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, said $100,000 could be a possibility for bitcoin. \"I think bitcoin probably breaks all-time highs this year,\" Beard said, adding that the $100,000 price figure is an \"interesting number.\" Beard said that if bitcoin gets to its previous record high of near $69,000, \"it doesn't take much more for it to lift up\" to $100,000. Bitcoin would need to rally around 270% to hit $100,000.\n\nPaolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at stablecoin issuer Tether, said bitcoin could \"retest\" its all-time high near $69,000. The predictions of new record highs mark a more optimistic outlook than in January when industry executives told CNBC that they expected 2023 to be a year of caution.\n\nIs bitcoin finally becoming 'digital gold'?\n\nPart of the industry's positive view on bitcoin right now actually stems from how the asset has performed during the banking turmoil sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the failure of two crypto-friendly lenders Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank. Instead of crashing, bitcoin rallied. Bitcoin proponents say this is evidence that bitcoin is offering an alternative to the traditional banking system as a place for people to keep their money safe. \"I think the rally is explicable by saying, people have got freaked out by the banking system by the collapses,\" Oliver Linch, CEO of Bittrex Global, told CNBC in an interview at Paris Blockchain Week on Thursday.\n\nBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has been stealthily rising in 2023. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nFor many years, bitcoin advocates have argued bitcoin is a form of \"digital gold\" \u2014 a safe-haven asset that can provide investors a hedge against inflation and an investment in times of turmoil. But over the past few years, bitcoin has traded in correlation with stocks, in particular the tech-heavy Nasdaq. There are now signs of decoupling with bitcoin massively outperforming the Nasdaq, many other risk-assets and gold this year. But bitcoin also got a boost on hopes the banking crisis maybe reduce the U.S. Federal Reserve's ability to be as aggressive on interest rate rises, which would be supportive for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe $1 million bitcoin bet\n\nDiscussion of where the digital coin's price could go this year has been rife since Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and the former technology chief at Coinbase, wagered on Mar. 17 that bitcoin would be worth $1 million or more in 90 days. He bet $2 million. The wager was in response to a Twitter user who said that they would bet $1 million that the U.S. does not enter hyperinflation. Srinivasan argued that the \"world redenominates on Bitcoin as digital gold\" as hyperinflation kicks in, erodes the value of the U.S. dollar, and nations, individuals and companies begin to buy large amounts of bitcoin. Hyperinflation is the massive rise in prices in an economy.\n\nI think for bitcoin to be a million dollars in 90 days, some crazy things are happening in the world, which we don't want. Marshall Beard Chief strategy officer, Gemini"

Hence, a sudden spike in activity often leads to network congestion \u2013 transactions waiting to get verified. In such situations, miners target transactions with higher fees first. In other words, the more a user offers in fees, the faster his transaction is likely to be verified."

        "title": "Attackers hit Bitcoin ATMs to steal $1.5 million in crypto cash - The Register",
        "content": "Unidentified miscreants have siphoned cryptocurrency valued at more than $1.5 million from Bitcoin ATMs by exploiting an unknown flaw in digicash delivery systems.\n\nAccording to General Bytes, the outfit that sold the ATMs and had managed some of them with a cloud service, the attackers used an interface designed to upload videos to instead inject a malicious Java application, and then subverted ATM user privileges.\n\nThey drained at least 56 Bitcoin \u2013 about $1.5 million as of publication time \u2013 from crypto wallets. General Bytes issued a patch 15 hours after discovering the intrusion, but by then the digital coins were gone, leaving an unknown number of victims on the hook for the lost money.\n\n\"The entire team has been working around the clock to collect all data regarding the security breach and is continuously working to resolve all cases to help clients back online and continue to operate their ATMs as soon as possible,\" General Bytes explained in a statement.\n\nGeneral Bytes notified companies that bought its ATMs to shut down their systems. The supplier, headquartered in Prague with a US office in Bradenton, Florida, sells and operates five different models of crypto ATM.\n\nPeople use them to exchange Bitcoin and other currencies. In all, General Bytes says it has sold more than 15,000 terminals in 149 countries supporting more than 180 currencies. The systems have performed more than 15.2 million transactions.\n\nThe attack\n\nBusinesses buying the ATMs connect them to a crypto application server (CAS) managed by the customer themselves or \u2013 until now \u2013 General Bytes through cloud service provider DigitalOcean.\n\nIn the breach over the weekend, the attackers exploited a vulnerability that had gone undetected despite multiple security audits since 2021. The baddies scanned DigitalOcean's IP address space and found Crypto Application Server (CAS) services on port 7741 \u2013 including General Bytes' cloud service and other customers running their ATMs on DigitalOcean.\n\n\"Using this security vulnerability, the attacker uploaded his application directly to the application server used by the admin interface,\" the chastened ATM vendor wrote. \"The application server was, by default, configured to start applications in its deployment folder.\"\n\nThe miscreants accessed the database, read and decrypted API keys and exchanges, and drained digital coins from wallets. They could also download usernames and password hashes, turn off multifactor authentication, access terminal event logs, and search for instances where users scanned private keys at the terminals.\n\nThis is the second such attack on General Bytes, which had digital coins stolen in August 2022 by miscreants exploiting a flaw in the CAS.\n\nThe problem with hot wallets\n\nHot wallets present a particular problem in the high-risk crypto market. Wallets would be safer if disconnected from the internet, but users rely on them for quick transactions, which calls for connectivity.\n\n\"The entire purpose of hot wallets is to provide an immediate ability to make transactions,\" John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at cybersecurity firm Netenrich, told The Register. \"That said, the security of any wallet is tied to the security of the private key. If someone gets that \u2013 which can be copied \u2013 it's game over. All the layers of protection against fraud don't and can't apply to crypto.\"\n\nGeneral Bytes said it is shutting down its cloud services, noting it is \"theoretically (and practically) impossible to secure a system granting access to multiple operators at the same time where some of them are bad actors.\"\n\nAll customers now will manage their own terminals using their own servers. General Bytes will help businesses migrate their data from the cloud to their standalone servers. It's also urging customers to keep their CAS behind a firewall and VPN to prevent other attackers getting into them through the internet.\n\nThey also should assume all their users' passwords and API keys to exchanges and hot wallets are compromised.\n\nThe Register has asked General Bytes for further comment and will update if more information comes in.\n\nCrypto theft is a big business that is only growing bigger. According to blockchain biz Chainalysis, $3.8 billion in digital coins were stolen in 2022, compared with $500 million two years earlier. Mike Parkin, senior technical evangelist at risk remediation vendor Vulcan Cyber, said there is only one way to really reduce the risk that comes with cryptocurrency: Get out of it altogether.\n\n\"It may not be the answer people want to hear, but crypto is still immature, volatile, unregulated, and subject to new and creative cyber criminal attacks,\" Parkin told The Register. \"Do you really want your money in this space?\" \u00ae"

        "title": "Bitcoin shines but here's why altcoins failed to catch up amid banking crisis - Business Today",
        "content": "The recent banking crisis in the US and Europe has sparked a strong rally in Bitcoin, but other crypto assets have been unable to translate this action into their prices. A majority of the altcoins have underperformed the largest crypto asset in the near-term price appreciation.\n\n\n\nIn the last two weeks, Bitcoin's price has jumped more than 40 per cent to $28,250 on Wednesday, March 22, 2023. The largest crypto asset was trading at around $19,950 on March 10, 2023. However, other major tokens including Ethereum, BNB, Cardano, XRP have failed to perform on a similar line.\n\n\n\nAnalysts said that bitcoin is always seen as a store of value and amid the banking crisis in some of the strongest economies of the world and gloomy macroeconomic sentiments, its safe-haven appeal has increased and investors are lapping up the digital token.\n\n\n\nEdul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex said that factors such as banking sector instability, high inflation data and reduced confidence in a dovish Federal Reserve have pushed the demand for Bitcoin, which is trading near its nine-month highs.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation and a bet against the devaluing US dollar and investors prefer it over altcoins. Investor's trust in Bitcoin as a secure store of value is reflected in its increasing value, rather than a general sentiment towards cryptocurrencies that rely heavily on their ecosystem fundamentals,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe dominance of Bitcoin in the total crypto market has increased to more than 46 per cent on Wednesday, according to the data from Coinmarketcap. The total market capitalization of Bitcoin is around $550 billion, while the crypto market is commanding a cumulative marketcap of $1.18 trillion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has experienced a significant rally over the past few days. However, when looking at the overall crypto market cap, it has only increased by 8% to $1.17 trillion. This implies that there is a lack of significant fresh investment entering the market, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"The uncertainty surrounding stablecoins and illiquid assets in the banking sector has caused individuals to move from stablecoins to Bitcoin instead of depositing their money in banks,\" it said. \"The market direction will be determined by the outcome of Fed's FOMC meeting.\"\n\n\n\nBitcoin is also considered sensitive to changes in money supply, and as such, many have argued that the increase in the size of the Fed's balance sheet is the key driver of the rally, said Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX.\n\n\n\n\"Last week, the Fed and its allies effectively bailed out the depositors of SVB. As part of this bailout, the Fed had to increase its balance sheet by $300 billion. The Fed printed 300 billion new dollars, given that Bitcoin was built in response to the 2008 bank bailouts. BTC's price went parabolic in response to the SVB bailout,\" he added.\n\n\n\nAnalysts said that Bitcoin is the oldest and most known crypto asset among investors. Interestingly, not only bitcoin, gold is also gaining momentum but its counterpart silver is unable to catch up with the rise.\n\n\n\nNew investors in the crypto space tend to gravitate towards the more established coins, such as Bitcoin over taking risks on relatively unknown Altcoins. The recent rise in Bitcoin's price and the attention it's been getting in the news may also be bringing in more mainstream investors and institutions, which would make it even more dominant on the market, said Menon from WazirX.\n\nAlso read: Hindustan Zinc shares jump 5% after dividend announcement; here's what analysts say\n\nAlso read: Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin tops $28,000; XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin rally up to 21%"

        "content": "Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency among American adults. It\u2019s easy to open a bitcoin account: in this article, we\u2019ll provide several ways of doing it and straightforward guidance.\n\nOpening a bitcoin account is quick and easy\n\nOpening a bitcoin (BTC) account is as easy as installing an app on your mobile device or laptop. Once you install the app, your bitcoin wallet will automatically be created. However, you\u2019ll have to decide what specific bitcoin wallet you want.\n\nJust because you can store bitcoin digitally doesn\u2019t mean you should keep it just anywhere. If you plan to open a bitcoin account, this guide will tell you everything you need to know.\n\nWhat is a bitcoin wallet\n\nBitcoin wallets can store cryptocurrency holdings like bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) and XRP. This digital storage device contains private keys to access and spend your coins. They come in many forms, including physical hardware devices, software applications, and even paper printouts. You can use your bitcoin wallet to send and receive payments and store funds securely offline in so-called cold storage.\n\nMost bitcoin wallets put you in control of your private keys, meaning you are responsible for keeping your bitcoins secure. Depending on how diligent you are about using your private keys, this can be advantageous or disadvantageous.\n\nHow does a bitcoin wallet work\n\nJust like you need a physical wallet to store your cash and credit cards, a bitcoin wallet is where you store your bitcoins. But unlike a physical wallet, a bitcoin wallet is entirely digital and functions like an email address. You must log into your account using your private key, access your cryptocurrency, and send amounts to the intended recipients.\n\nThere are two main types of bitcoin wallets:\n\nHot wallet: Hot wallets store bitcoin private keys on internet-connected devices. While they are easy and convenient to use, they can pose a significant security risk to bitcoin holders who lose their primary device. If you open a bitcoin account, only use a hot wallet to store small amounts of crypto.\n\nHot wallets store bitcoin private keys on internet-connected devices. While they are easy and convenient to use, they can pose a significant security risk to bitcoin holders who lose their primary device. If you open a bitcoin account, only use a hot wallet to store small amounts of crypto. Cold wallet: Cold wallets store bitcoin private keys offline. They are highly secure and eliminate any risk of compromise by hackers.\n\nHow to open a bitcoin account: step-by-step\n\nNow that you know the basics of bitcoin, it\u2019s time to open an account. Follow these simple steps:\n\nGo to any cryptocurrency exchange website that supports bitcoin, such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Bitstamp. Enter your email address and a strong password. You\u2019ll receive a verification code in your email. Once you verify your account, you can start depositing funds immediately. There are many ways to transfer funds, including bank transfers and credit cards. Once you\u2019ve deposited your funds, you can buy and sell bitcoin.\n\nTypes of wallets you can open\n\nLike physical wallets, there are many bitcoin wallets to choose from. Each has its advantages and disadvantages \u2013 let\u2019s break them down below.\n\nMobile wallet\n\nA mobile crypto wallet is perfect for face-to-face trades and shopping at brick-and-mortar establishments. Most mobile wallets use near-field communication (NFC), allowing users to tap their phone on a terminal to start a transaction.\n\nPros\n\nHighly portable and convenient\n\nVery easy to set up\n\nAdded security with two-factor authentication\n\nCons\n\nLeast secure digital wallet as it is prone to hacking\n\nNo control over nodes and transactions\n\nEU-licensed CryptoWallet is one example of mobile wallet with an exchange service incorporated. Within the app, you can create multiple wallets for bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, as many mobile wallets, it allows customers to pay online and spend cryptocurrencies like real money. In addition to that, CryptoWallet offers an affiliate program. When your associate registers in CryptoWallet using your rewards code, you\u2019ll get a percentage of any transaction fees charged.\n\nCryptoWallet interface | Source: CryptoWallet.com\n\nTrust Wallet is another popular mobile wallet integrated with major crypto exchange Coinbase. Same as CryptoWallet, it allows users to store multiple cryptocurrencies and even NFT collectibles in one place. The wallet is integrated with BinancePay that allows you to use cryptocurrencies in the real world, for instance, pay in shops.\n\nThe mobile wallets are trying to keep pace with security measures and regulations. For instance, CryptoWallet has recently renewed a trading license in Estonia amid tightening EU crypto legislation. However, it\u2019s worth remembering all the cons mentioned above and avoid storing big amounts of crypto in hot wallets.\n\nSoftware wallet\n\nSoftware wallets are mobile or desktop applications that connect to the internet to facilitate transactions. Most software wallets are fully self-custodial, meaning wallet providers cannot access your cryptocurrency \u2013 only you can.\n\nPros\n\nNo cost to download, no registration fee\n\nEasy to use\n\nSmaller risk of hacking compared to mobile wallets\n\nMetaMask is probably one of the most popular software wallets out there, with both browser extension and an app available to users. As a software wallet, it provides a convenient way for users to store, send, and receive ethereum and ethereum-based tokens like ERC-20 and ERC-721.\n\nIntegration with dapps is one of the MetaMask advantages. The wallet seamlessly integrates with a multitude of dapps, enabling users to access various decentralized services, like decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and gaming applications.\n\nMoreover, users can easily add custom tokens to their wallets, enabling the management of a wide range of assets. However, MetaMask supports only ethereum-based tokens, making it unsuitable for users seeking a multi-chain wallet solution.\n\nIt is also important to keep in mind the cons of using software wallets. For instance, it\u2019s not decentralized enough for some crypto enthusiasts, as MetaMask transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain, which could reveal users\u2019 wallet addresses and associated transaction history. Moreover, although MetaMask offers reasonable security features, it does not provide the same level of protection as hardware wallets, which are considered the most secure way to store crypto assets.\n\nHardware wallet\n\nHardware wallets are cold wallets that you can use to perform offline transactions. There are several different types of hardware wallets available on the market. The most popular ones are the Ledger Nano S and Trezor Model T. These wallets support a wide range of cryptocurrencies and have built-in screens that make it easy to confirm transactions before signing them.\n\nPros\n\nKeys are more secure as they are never connected to the internet\n\nEasy to back up and restore\n\nCons\n\nNot ideal for frequent bitcoin transactions as they can be difficult to access\n\nSome hardware wallet sellers are unreliable/not secure\n\nCentralized exchange wallet\n\nCentralized exchanges (CEXs) are similar to trading accounts in that third parties manage accounts, exchanges, wallets, and transactions.\n\nPros\n\nEasy to set up and use\n\nCompatible with desktops or mobile devices\n\nCons\n\nNot secure unless trading bitcoin immediately\n\nRequires permission for withdrawal\n\nLonger withdrawal periods\n\nHigh transaction fees\n\nBinance\u2019s P2P service can serve as an example of a centralized exchange wallet, where traders\u2019 funds can be exchanged online within seconds. Crypto assets traded on Binance P2P are not stored on the platform itself. Once a trade is completed, the purchased cryptocurrency is transferred to the user\u2019s Binance wallet.\n\nPaper Wallet\n\nTo use paper wallets, you must download a software package to generate key pairs. Then, you\u2019ll print these key pairs on paper, enabling you to access and store bitcoin offline.\n\nPros\n\nLow-cost alternative to hardware wallets\n\nIdeal for face-to-face transactions\n\nCons\n\nEasy to lose paper keys\n\nRequires physical access to the printed keys\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile opening a bitcoin account is relatively straightforward, what type of wallet you choose will dictate how secure your coins are. Think about how you want to access your bitcoin, what you want to use it for, and what is most convenient for you. Here\u2019s the brief summary to guide you:\n\nHot wallet: can be used for trading, paying in crypto, exchanging on P2P, and other goals that require quick access to your coins via internet.\n\nCold wallet: can be used for long-term storage of crypto, savings, etc.\n\nWhen you do your homework, buying and selling crypto is a breeze. If you\u2019re new to bitcoin, consider what wallets are best for safely holding and storing crypto.\n\nFAQ: how to open a bitcoin account"

The former Coinbase CTO stated that hyperinflation, fueled by the Fed\u2019s Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP,) would trigger the move.\n\nThe BTFP is an emergency lending initiative, offering financial institutions loans against U.S. Treasuries, agency debt, mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets pledged as collateral. It was a response to banking failures, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n\u201cThe BTFP will be an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities, eliminating an institution\u2019s need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress.\u201d\n\nQuantitative Easing (QE) refers to central banks buying assets, having the knock-on effect of balance sheet expansion, during a low-interest rate environment.\n\nBitcoin Magazine (BM)explained that the BTFP is QE, except for crucial differences in the program targeting financial institutions specifically and no outright purchase of pledged assets, as the liquidity is via short-term loans. In addition, although not mentioned in the BM article, it is worth pointing out that the U.S. is currently in a (relatively) high-interest rate environment.\n\nHowever, the program is still a balance sheet expansion, leading to excess liquidity in the banking system.\n\nHayes explains how BTC gets to a million\n\nGiving his take on how the BFTP would impact crypto/risk-on assets, Hayes began by distinguishing inside money and outside money.\n\nInside money is a liability on someone else\u2019s balance sheet; it can be dollars, yen, euro, yuan, stocks, and bonds. Crucially, what distinguishes it is \u201cyou can\u2019t utilize these things without interfacing with the fiat financial system and the people that are deputized to act in it,\u201d he said.\n\nBy contrast, outside money is not a liability on someone\u2019s balance sheet; it can be gold, real estate, and Bitcoin. Outside money is advantageous over inside money because the banking system does not affect it.\n\n\u201cThe banking system goes bust, outside money still works. You can still live in your house, you can still walk around with a bar of gold, you can still use the Bitcoin blockchain.\u201d\n\nHayes said you want outside money when the Fed is propping up the entire banking system, adding that banks (who hold BFTP-qualifying assets) cannot go bust.\n\nUnder this setup, the money supply expands infinitely at some point, resulting in price appreciation for outside money assets such as Bitcoin.\n\nWhen?\n\nOn why Bitcoin won\u2019t go to $1 million soon, Hayes said this program guarantees the return of depositors\u2019 money. It is not an inflationary driver if depositors leave their funds with the bank.\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t lending any of this money out, so there\u2019s not any credit creation happening. I\u2019m just guaranteeing losses. So, for the time being, this is all dead money.\u201d\n\nHowever, once the Fed cuts rates and goes full dovish, such as being forced to \u201cin a nasty recession,\u201d the system\u2019s liquidity gets unlocked. When combined with easier borrowing, the pivot will trigger a spike in asset prices, sending Bitcoin on its way to $1 million.\n\nHayes expects the Fed to cut rates \u201cin the near future.\u201d But he still expects a choppy road to $1 million, with dips along the way.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "In this issue\n\nBitcoin: What crisis? Arbitrum: Network effects Guo Wengui: Hammer time\n\nFrom the Editor\u2019s Desk Dear Reader, It\u2019s not without a quiet sense of irony that we have been watching recent events unfold in the traditional banking sector. After a year in which the cryptocurrency industry has suffered unprecedented pain, it now seems to be TradFi\u2019s turn, with the collapses of U.S. lenders Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to be followed by that of Credit Suisse, once a bastion of Big Finance and one of only 30 systemically important global lenders. The Swiss heavyweight\u2019s problems triggered a worldwide banking market rout that has wiped around US$1 trillion off the value of finance sector shares in recent days. Nobody is suggesting for a moment that this makes the US$60 billion implosion of Terra or the US$8 billion hole that FTX\u2019s crash left behind look small \u2014 and keep in mind that these sums were proportionally a much larger chunk of the crypto market than the latest share rout represents for TradFi. But it does put the 48% rise in crypto market cap over the past 14 days \u2014 particularly, perhaps, Bitcoin\u2019s 71% gain since the beginning of the year \u2014 into perspective. So once again it has come to pass that a number of investors seem to be feeling at least as safe putting money into crypto as they do putting it into traditional banks. The crowing and \u201ctold you so\u201d sneering by some in the TradFi space during crypto\u2019s annus horribilis, in light of this, has the feel of rather ill-advised schadenfreude. We should emphasize that any such gloating among the crypto community would be equally ill-advised \u2014 not only given the industry\u2019s woes of the past year but also the fact that turmoil in any part of the financial system, from Main Street banks to memecoins, heaps misery on investors large and (especially) small. Yet the irony remains. And with it persists one of the driving forces of the crypto phenomenon and the financial revolution that it has given the world. Crypto may have been down lately, but it\u2019s far from out. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast\n\n1. Boosted\n\nBitcoin has surged amid the collapses of several banks in the U.S. and Europe as investors question the fragility of the mainstream finance system. Image: Canva\n\nBy the numbers: Bitcoin \u2014 over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.\n\nThe banking crisis in the U.S. and Europe that has roiled markets recently may be adding to investors\u2019 appetite for crypto assets as Bitcoin powers a rally in cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin has gained over 14% in the past seven days, and briefly breached the US$28,000 mark on Monday for the first time since June 2022, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has soared more than 70% since the start of the year. Alongside Bitcoin, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies rebounded from around US$914 billion on March 10 to top US$1.18 trillion at press time, a jump of more than 29%.\n\nAt the same time, worries about systematic risks in the banking system are putting pressure on equity markets and prompting authorities to take action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which has taken over failed lenders Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, has announced that most Signature Bank deposits would be handed over to a unit of Hicksville, NY-headquartered New York Community Bancorp.\n\nIn Europe, Swiss authorities have initiated an emergency takeover of global investment bank Credit Suisse by UBS after the former\u2019s imperiled financial status sent its share price to record lows last week.\n\nConcerns are increasing that the list of failed banks will grow longer. Last Friday, Moody\u2019s Investor Service downgraded embattled U.S. lender First Republic Bank, whose stock closed 32.8% lower on the day, despite a US$30 billion rescue plan to backstop it. Last Sunday, S&P Global downgraded First Republic for a second time in five days, according to a Reuters report.\n\nHowever, fears over fragility of the banking system are also driving the prices of cryptocurrencies higher, Kadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve embarked upon a many-trillion dollar quantitative easing program, cut the minimum bank reserves from 10% to 0% on March 26, 2020, and led us into the current bout with inflation, which has led people to seek alternative ways to preserve wealth. Bitcoin has become a prominent option,\u201c Stadelmann wrote.\n\nThe troubles in the banking industry may even prompt a monetary policy shift by the Federal Reserve, which last weekend announced a coordinated move with other central banks to make more U.S. dollars available to improve market liquidity. Analysts at CME Group are now divided on whether the Fed will further raise interest rates at its meeting on March 22 as policymakers weigh financial and price stability.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index rose 6% year on year last month, a level still well above the Fed\u2019s goal of keeping annual inflation below 2%. Stubborn inflation, accompanied by the Fed\u2019s dovish monetary policy tendencies, is contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s price gains, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Bitcoin\u2019s surge has been explained in two ways. The first, and arguably the most popular, is that the banking system has lied to investors, and that the breakdown in trust has sent investors looking for something with better credentials. The second has more to do with U.S. regulators\u2019 desire to backstop the banking industry, as they did early on in the Covid-19 pandemic. When lockdowns and other pandemic controls were announced in 2020, stock and crypto prices nosedived. What helped them bounce back were the extraordinary measures taken by central banks and other regulators around the world to economies running. The reassurance their actions provided led to surges in the values of stocks and digital assets alike. In recent days, crypto prices have sunk on news that crypto-friendly banks were failing, but they have recovered since U.S. regulators stepped in. The first week of March, which saw the highest level of capital flight from crypto since the collapse of FTX last September, provided the backdrop and was the fifth consecutive week of money leaving the industry. While some Bitcoin boosters may be gleeful amid TradFi\u2019s troubles, crypto is just as reliant on the rest of the finance sector and the world\u2019s central banks as any other industry.\n\n2. Ready to drop\n\nThe launch of Arbitrum\u2019s governance token due to take place this week has stirred much excitement among investors as well as the popping up of similar-sounding projects that are likely scams. Image: Arbitrum/Canva\n\nBy the numbers: Arbitrum \u2014 over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.\n\nArbitrum, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, is set to launch its new native governance token, ARB, and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance model for the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova networks on Thursday, March 23.\n\nAround 56% of Arbitrum tokens will be community-owned and 12.75% of the community allocation will be distributed in Thursday\u2019s airdrop. The remainder of the supply will be distributed by the DAO over time.\n\nThe ARB token will have an initial supply of 10 billion and will allow holders to vote on community proposals through the DAO.\n\nAirdropped tokens will be tradable within a week, while tokens held by early investors and team members will be subject to a four-year lock-up. The first unlock will take place a year from the date of issuance, followed by subsequent yearly unlocks.\n\nMore than 625,000 wallets are eligible for the airdrop, according to blockchain analytics firm Nansen, which provided on-chain data to help develop the token\u2019s distribution.\n\nSeveral large exchanges, including Binance and Bybit, said they would list the new token from its launch date.\n\nFutures markets for the Arbitrum token have already opened. The Arbitrum IOU token is down 27% since Friday, trading at US$7.32 at 04:25 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Arbitrum\u2019s token launch is this month\u2019s answer to the Blur token\u2019s airdrop in February. The excitement around a governance token is less about holders being able to vote on community proposals and DAO participation than it is about capitalizing on a surge in popularity. The Arbitrum IOU placeholder token has racked up a trading volume of US$4 million over the past day on Hotbit, and a token for Solana\u2019s ARB Protocol is up 890% in the past week, perhaps because they bear names similar to that of the forthcoming Ethereum layer-2 token. There are also copycats looking to capitalize on the launch frenzy and investor gullibility. CoinGecko has accused ArbiSwap of \u201cminting 1 billion fake tokens\u201d and committing a rug-pull. In a Twitter post last Sunday, Arbitrum News DAO said it had identified more than 273 phishing sites related to Arbitrum since the protocol announced the airdrop. Meanwhile, crypto security startup Redefine drew attention to a website that it said was impersonating Arbitrum\u2019s airdrop site. Where there\u2019s excitement and hype in crypto, keep a cool head and be on the lookout for scams.\n\n3. Guoing to jail?\n\nThe massive crypto fraud of which Guo Wengui stands accused may eclipse the other controversies for which he is known. Image: Emmert/Getty Images\n\nExiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui was arrested in New York last week for allegedly orchestrating a fraud worth more than US$1 billion that included cryptocurrency, according to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nGuo \u2014 known variously as Miles Guo, Ho Wan Kwok and \u201cBrother Seven\u201d \u2014 has been charged by the DOJ with multiple counts of wire fraud, securities fraud, bank fraud and money laundering on suspicion he solicited investments in various entities through false statements and representations to \u201chundreds of thousands of [his] online followers,\u201d the DOJ said in a statement.\n\nGuo and other defendants stand accused of obtaining more than US$262 million in victims\u2019 funds through the Himalaya Exchange, a purported cryptocurrency ecosystem, the DOJ said, adding that it had seized approximately US$634 million from 21 bank accounts linked to the alleged fraud.\n\nThe DOJ alleges that Guo lied, promising his victims outsized returns if they backed a number of his ventures, including GTV Media Group Inc., a media company he formed in 2020 with Steve Bannon, an ex-adviser to former U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nGuo was also charged by the SEC for his alleged involvement in unregistered and fraudulent offerings that raised more than US$850 million.\n\nThe SEC said one of the offerings raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors through a crypto asset security referred to as \u201cH-Coin,\u201d or \u201cHimalaya Coin,\u201d by falsely stating that 20% of its value was backed by gold and that Guo \u201cwould personally compensate investors for any potential losses.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn reality, Guo took advantage of the hype and allure surrounding crypto and other investments to victimize thousands and fund his and his family\u2019s lavish lifestyle,\u201d Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s enforcement division, said in a statement. CNN reported that Guo had been denied bail in a hearing the same day.\n\n\u201cKwok is charged with lining his pockets with the money he stole, including buying himself, and his close relatives, a 50,000 square foot mansion in New Jersey, a US$3.5 million Ferrari, and even two US$36,000 mattresses, and financing a US$37 million luxury yacht,\u201d U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in the DOJ statement.\n\nThe International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) issued a \u201cred notice\u201d in 2017 for Guo\u2019s arrest at the request of Chinese authorities over suspected bribery of Chinese officials and other crimes, according to a report by the South China Morning Post."

        "title": "Unregulated crypto ATMs give criminals a loophole to prey on unsuspecting victims - CBS News",
        "content": "Police say scammers are using cryptocurrency ATMs to steal from victims\n\nCrypto ATMs, or kiosks, are increasingly being used as a tool for scams across the country. The machines are often unregulated and unregistered, providing a loophole for criminals to take advantage of unsuspecting victims.\n\nIn Oct. 2021, artist Joe Samuels thought he was contacting his computer company's IT department. During the call, he granted someone access to remotely fix his computer, which appeared to work.\n\nHowever, a few months later, he received another call from someone claiming to be from the same IT department. They told him that they had mistakenly deposited $20,000 into his checking account and demanded he send it back through a Bitcoin ATM.\n\n\"And they're telling me, calling me. 'You got to pay us back. Otherwise we're going to get the FBI,'\" said Samuels, who is 84.\n\nFearing for his safety, Samuels complied and deposited $20,000 in cash into a Bitcoin of America kiosk located near his apartment in Hartford, Connecticut. Five days later, he discovered that the scammers had actually moved his own money from his savings account into his checking account.\n\nThe crypto kiosk that Samuels used was seized but Samuels paid the price: he spent a week in the hospital and two years later, he has not been able to recuperate the money. He is now living with his son since he can not afford to live on his own.\n\n\"That's what I gotta deal with. But then again, you know, I feel very fortunate. I take the opportunity to just paint. And put the work away,\" Samuels said.\n\nRight now, there are about 32,000 crypto ATMs and kiosks across the country \u2013 up from 1,200 in 2018. Although they resemble regular ATMs, they convert cash into digital cryptocurrency that goes to a digital wallet instead of a traditional bank account.\n\nBitcoin of America, accused of aiding scammers who stole millions from victims using its kiosks, faces charges of conspiracy and money laundering along with its CEO and two others. The kiosks were allegedly unlicensed and profitable in Ohio.\n\nBitcoin of America CEO Sonny Meraban was arrested in Miami earlier this month and charged with crimes including money laundering and conspiracy.\n\nAccording to Connecticut State Police Detective Matthew Hogan, who specializes in financial crimes and cryptocurrency, some of these machines are safe for consumers. But he warns that due to the lack of regulation around them, many are used for scams or crimes like money laundering. Hogan also believes that they are deliberately placed in high-crime areas.\n\n\"I think they're strategically placed on purpose because they're getting a higher percentage of use in those locations of high crime,\" Hogan said.\n\nCybersecurity expert Bree Fowler from CNET warns that crypto ATMs pose a unique risk because many are unregulated and unlicensed.\n\n\"They're, you know, on some levels not any different than a soda or a candy machine. If you see one of these things, just don't use them right now,\" Fowler said.\n\nCBS News reached out to Bitcoin of America for comment on the indictment. The company did not respond, and the CEO has also not responded to requests for comment. Bitcoin of America's website has also been shut down.\n\nBefore the indictment of Meraban, the company claimed in court that they had given Samuels' money to a third party whose identity remains unknown. A judge ordered that Samuels' money be handed over to Bitcoin of America. However, now that the company is facing legal issues, Samuels' family is considering suing Bitcoin of America to recover their lost funds."

CBDCs are issued and controlled by central banks, unlike stablecoins and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nAmid criticism of excessive energy use by Bitcoin miners, U.S. President Joe Biden on March 9 proposed a 30% tax on electricity used in cryptocurrency mining in his budget blueprint for Fiscal Year 2024.\n\nSee related story: China\u2019s mining exodus flows to U.S. Is Texas the new promised land?"

        "content": "To understand what Bitcoin mining is and how it works, we have to consider the nature of cryptocurrencies: since there is no central controlling authority, there is no \u2018bank\u2019 that manages BTC exchanges and mints new coins. In fact, Bitcoin is administered by a network of independent nodes that abide by rules defined by an algorithm. This decentralised network is in charge of the shared ledger of transactions: the blockchain, whose blocks of information are created and hooked precisely through Bitcoin mining.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin mining? Meaning and Purpose\n\nSome nodes in Bitcoin\u2018s network solve complex mathematical problems, using sophisticated power and hardware. This fair amount of work goes into producing the blocks of the blockchain, safeguarding its security and issuing new coins. This is the starting point for understanding the meaning of Bitcoin mining, but let\u2019s delve deeper into what it is and how it works.\n\nThe first objective of this process is the validation of transactions: the blocks created contain the information on these exchanges, which are thus stored and confirmed without the possibility of modification. In a nutshell, the blockchain tracks all cryptocurrency movements, so as to provide irrefutable proof of their authenticity and thwart attempts at double-spending. Everything Bitcoin mining records in blocks is verified, without the need for authorities and intermediaries, and is available in an eternal and immutable history.\n\nThe commitment of the nodes that take care of the blockchain must be rewarded, because Bitcoin mining operations are expensive and no one would participate without financial return. Each block, therefore, corresponds to a reward in BTC (block reward), sent to the wallet of the creating node. The second purpose of the mining mechanism, therefore, is the issuance of new coins as a reward: 21 million Bitcoins, the maximum set supply, will be released in this way. In this regard, as we will see in the section explaining how Bitcoin mining works, the incentives are scheduled to gradually decrease over time. In addition to the block reward, fees paid by users to carry out transactions are also distributed.\n\nThe nodes that perform the calculations to create the blocks are called miners, precisely because they \u2018mine\u2018 cryptocurrencies as if they were minerals. This explains the meaning of Bitcoin mining from an etymological point of view. Satoshi Nakamoto\u2018s crypto is also referred to as Digital Gold by the community, although the comparison to gold does not relate to mining, but derives from the reserve quality of value that some recognise in BTC.\n\nHow does Bitcoin mining work?\n\nThe entire network participates in the creation of a block, but it is only one miner who receives the rewards; let\u2019s therefore summarise in essential steps how Bitcoin mining works. First, when a transaction is made on the network, it is transmitted to all nodes. Each of them verifies its validity, based on the rules of cryptography: in a nutshell, by comparing the public key and the sender\u2019s \u2018signature\u2019, it is ascertained that the latter is the legitimate owner of the funds. The transactions, if approved by the majority of the network, are then aggregated in the mempool: a sort of \u2018waiting room\u2019, from which they will be retrieved to be registered on the blockchain. At this point, the miners must create a new blockchain by solving a complex mathematical problem. These nodes compete with each other, because whoever finds the solution first will receive the valuable reward.\n\nIn short, this is the process that explains how Bitcoin mining works, but it is useful to set some technical parameters for a better understanding. First, it is essential to know that Bitcoin blocks must be produced every 10 minutes: this block time is programmed and stored by an algorithm. In practice, an automatic mechanism increases (or decreases) the difficulty of mining, so that the time per block is kept constant. In this way, the blockchain should be protected from spam attacks and, above all, it is possible to predict the distribution rate of new Bitcoins. Every 2016 blocks (approx. 2 weeks), therefore, the average block production period is evaluated and, if necessary, the complexity of the calculations to be performed is corrected.\n\nIn this regard, the puzzle to be solved consists in determining the hash of the block, i.e. the alphanumeric string that identifies it. This sequence is obtained by processing and \u2018summarising\u2019 various pieces of information with a mathematical function. The data to be processed, however, are not only known elements, such as transactions. The real meaning of Bitcoin mining, in fact, lies in finding a random number (nonce) that, together with the other factors, can generate the right hash. Miners basically work by trial and error and, to see if the result is correct, they compare the calculated combination with a target value, defined by the mining difficulty. If the value of your hash is less than or equal to this coefficient, they have found the right sequence.\n\nNB The hash constitutes proof of the work done, which is why Bitcoin\u2019s consensus mechanism is called Proof-of-Work. This algorithm, in general, is employed by all mining-based blockchains.\n\nOnce the exact hash is found, the corresponding block is created and the miner is rewarded with a certain amount of BTC. Initially, the reward was 50 per block, but every 4 years or so (210,000 blocks) it has been halved. Currently, the block reward is 6.25 BTC, but with the next halving, the mining reward will again be reduced by half. This mechanism, together with the fixed time per block, schedules the issuance of the crypto so as to make it a scarce resource and control the inflation rate.\n\nBitcoin mining: cost or profit?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin from the genesis block (3 January 2009) to today has increased exponentially, so the profit from mining should also (in theory) be higher. Halving itself, although reducing the rewards, makes it more profitable, because it generally has a positive effect on the value of the cryptocurrency, as suggested by models such as Stock-to-Flow. In parallel, however, competition between miners has also grown, exploiting increasingly powerful devices. As a result, Bitcoin mining is increasingly difficult, but this is good because it has made the network more secure.\n\nIn practice, a hacker would need to control at least 51% of the total computing capacity (Hash Rate) to attempt to tamper with the blockchain. But since we now know how Bitcoin mining works, we can guess that this is impossible: the Total Hash Rate is very high, as is the difficulty, not to mention that mining devices are very expensive. In fact, it is no longer possible to produce blocks with the CPU of a simple computer, but mining rigs with multiple graphics cards (GPUs) or even Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), hardware designed specifically for mining cryptocurrencies, are used.\n\nNB Given the costs and the fierce competition, many prefer ETFs to actual Bitcoin mining: financial instruments based on the securities of companies engaged in this activity, so as to try to earn money indirectly.\n\nMaking money from home mining, even with the most sophisticated device, however, is unlikely: the only way to get rewards is to join a mining pool. These huge data centres rely on the computing capacity of multiple devices: Foundry USA, AntPool and F2Pool are the main ones. If the devices are hosted in the same place, it\u2019s called a farm, but to participate you can also \u2018rent\u2019 computing capacity through cloud mining solutions. In any case, participating in a pool means paying a fee and sharing the rewards, thus limiting your earnings from mining.\n\nFinally, to complete the explanation of what Bitcoin mining is and how it works, we have to consider the cost of energy, which dwarfs its earnings. Indeed, miners have to use part of the rewards essentially to pay for electricity. In this regard, energy sustainability is one of the most critical aspects of what mining means."

        "content": "Is it Bitcoin\u2019s time to Shine, as the Banking System Falters?\n\nBitcoin's price action this week provides a clear market signal that Bitcoin is decoupling from other assets. Is Bitcoin, for the first time, acting as a safe haven asset in response to the traditional banking system and in response to a globally fraught central bank monetary policy?\n\nThe 30-day Pearson Correlation Coefficient between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 currently sits at -0.2. With the Nasdaq Composite, this correlation sits at 0.8. The correlation between Bitcoin and equity markets has broken. The S&P 500 is up just 0.3% in the last month, the Nasdaq Composite is up by ~3,1%. Conversely, the price of Bitcoin is up ~15.7% and has been enjoying strong gains.\n\nBitcoin has been touted as having the attributes of an uncorrelated asset. These are assets that move independently from the stock market and give investors a chance to beat the market.\n\nBitcoin has for a period of time, moved in lockstep with the equity market, both asset classes sold off and then soared together during extended periods in the last two years. There has been a prevalent view that Bitcoin\u2019s price has been driven by the Federal Reserve and macro-events.\n\nIn the last year, for example, the correlation between BTC and the S&P 500 had moved closer together with both asset classes reacting similarly to events like CPI prints. When the correlation did break it was because of disastrous black swan events like the LUNA/Terra/USDT collapse and the FTX implosion.\n\nThe prices of BTC, and the S&P 500. Source: Brave New Coin, FRED\n\nWhat is happening in the last month is very different, however.\n\nBitcoin was built to be a decentralized payment network that removed intermediaries and counterparties from transactions. It has a purposefully built hard-coded, predictable monetary supply. It was created during the 2008 financial crisis and it has found renewed support during the current banking crisis in the United States and Europe. Another factor is the hidden chaos in the developing world in countries like Lebanon and Turkey.\n\nEach of the banking collapse incidents listed below has an element of political interference and special concessions, and law changes, made to direct markets in a particular direction. Importantly, such interference is not possible with Bitcoin.\n\nBackstops and shutdowns, the US banking system wobbles\n\nIn the last two weeks, under different circumstances, three major American banks have been shut down. Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank have all had a run on deposits and have become entangled with regulators. This entire episode has created serious question marks surrounding the relationship between the government and the banking sector.\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is complicated and likely had a number of contributing factors. Extraordinarily, the bank did not have a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) between April 2022-December 2022. Danny Moses, an investor who predicted the 2008 financial crisis and was featured in the \u2018Big Short\u2019, said of SVB. \u201cThis isn\u2019t greed, necessarily, at the bank level,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s just \u2026 complete and utter bad risk management on the part of SVB.\u201d\n\nSVB has also been accused of being a \u2018woke bank\u2019, more interested in ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance \u2013 a way for investors to measure how socially concious a business is) initiatives than its core banking services.\n\nThe collapse is also notable because SVB had long lobbied for looser risk requirements \u2013 arguing that if it did fail, its collapse would not require government intervention. In 2015, SVB CEO Greg Becker argued in front of Congress that the US$50 billion balance sheet threshold outlined by the Dodd-Frank Legislation was unnecessary for his bank. He said SVB and other mid-sized banks, or regional banks, did not present systemic risks in case of collapse. In 2018, Dodd-Frank was rolled back by law makers from both the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\nFast-forward to March 2023 and US financial regulators were forced to step in to provide special accommodations to SVB depositors after the Treasury deemed the bank \u201cSystemically important\u201d.\n\nAnother key factor in the collapse of SVB and the other bank\u2019s struggles is a reversing global bond market and interest rate regime. Years of low-interest rates meant that SVB struggled to make returns. Seeking profits, SVB and other banks poured money into bonds, primarily long-term US treasuries.\n\nWhen interest rates started rising, SVB and other competitors had to sell the bonds they were exposed to because depositors needed to be paid more interest. The inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices meant that these bonds were sold at a loss. Concerns around the bank\u2019s ability to continue running this loss were a key factor in the run against SVB.\n\nThe Silvergate and Signature situations shared many characteristics of the SVB downfall \u2014 all three had overexposure to traditional banking risks like a lack of diversification and maturity mismatches. With these two banks, the added element of crypto gives their downfalls a unique angle.\n\nSilvergate was a bank noted for serving the cryptocurrency industry and had clients including Circle and FTX. The bank voluntarily ceased operations and liquidated assets after intense regulatory scrutiny from Financial Regulators and US lawmakers.\n\nUS Senators including Elizabeth Warren stated that because Silvergate was FTX\u2019s banking partner, and \u201creportedly facilitated transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda Research,\u201d it played some part in the fraud committed by the exchange and its sister companies.\n\nNic Carter, a noted digital asset analyst and advocate said on Twitter \u201cThe government also hastened the collapse of Silvergate by launching investigations and legal attacks on them. They\u2019re the arsonist and the firefighter in one\u201d. The fall of Silvergate raised other questions about the interference of politics in financial markets.\n\nSignature Bank, like Silvergate, was a bank noted for its services to the cryptocurrency industry and ability to cater to clients with digital assets on their books. Signature Bank was shut down by the New York State Department of Financial Services and its assets was seized by the FDIC. What made Signature different from Silvergate is that it was solvent at the time it was taken over by the FDIC.\n\nBarney Frank, a former Democrat congressman who was on the Signature Board said it was \u201can unjustified total shutdown\u201d. The bank was experiencing a surge in withdrawals but Frank said the situation was stabilizing. \u201cThe bank failed to provide reliable and consistent data, creating a significant crisis of confidence in the bank\u2019s leadership,\u201d is the response offered by a NYDFS spokesperson when asked why the bank was seized.\n\nA Swiss giant goes under\n\nFollowing the chaos in the US banking sector, this week it was announced that UBS, the largest bank in Switzerland will buy out ailing rival Credit Suisse. The Swiss National Bank announced that the UBS rescue operation would \u201csecure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy.\u201d The deal was brokered by the Swiss government and special measures including government guaranteed liquidity were put in place to ensure it would happen. It occurred without the approval of shareholders because of changes in laws made to ensure that there was no uncertainty surrounding the deal.\n\nIn 2022, Credit Suisse recorded its worst financial year since the Global Financial Crisis and for some time has been dealing with a market concerned about its stability and performance.\n\nThe rot has been setting in for some time at Credit Suisse. Source: NYSE CS stock price\n\nLast week the bank acknowledged that it had \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d in its bookkeeping. Given the uncertainty that was created following the closure of three notable American banks, Credit Suisse experienced a surge in withdrawals.\n\nThe Swiss banking giant tried to stem the flow through strategies like offering higher deposit rates but it was not enough. UBS was able to acquire Credit Suisse at a significant discount. Shareholders were wiped out as UBS received the equivalent of 0.76 Swiss Francs per their shares, likely disappointing because shares were trading for 1.86 Swiss Francs on Friday.\n\nAnother collapse looms large\n\nThe shares of First Republic Bank sank by more than 45% in a single day on Monday, hitting record lows. The Californian lender appears to be on its last leg but said it is \"well positioned to manage short-term deposit activity.\" The bank received a lifeline last week after a group of 11 banks lent First Republic US$30 billion.\n\nThere are whispers that JP Morgan is positioning itself to acquire First Republic. There are, however, views that regulators may be reluctant to let a major bank like JP Morgan make a sizable acquisition. The stock price of First Republic has reversed in the last day following statements from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen who said the government may backstop more depositors at regional banks.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s time to finally Shine?\n\nWith a new round of quantitative easing needed to ensure there is liquidity to guarantee bank depositors, further currency debasement and inflation seem likely. With gold already hitting new all-time highs, Bitcoin may yet prove itself to be the ultimate hedge and eventually do the same.\n\nDuring the Covid-19-driven global GDP challenges, did Bitcoin perform? No, it crashed brutally, like everything else. During the Russia-Ukraine invasion, did Bitcoin have a moment? Not really, interest rates shot through the roof, and Bitcoin once again traded as a risk asset, dropping 66% over 12 months.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price action over recent weeks suggests, however, that a new narrative is building. The market signal is clear and undeniable, as Bitcoin seeks to decouple from other risk asset classes.\n\nIs Bitcoin, ready to assume a position as a safe haven asset in response to a globally fraught central bank monetary policy? We\u2019ll know soon."

        "title": "Satoshi Nakamoto: The Bitcoin Creator Mystery | Young Platform - Young Platform",
        "content": "The identity of Bitcoin\u2018s creator is a mystery: we know their pseudonym, but no one has ever managed to find out who Satoshi Nakamoto is. On the Internet we can find a few clues, emails and posts in old forums, we know that they have been nominated for a Nobel Prize and we can perhaps estimate their net worth, but they seem destined for eternal anonymity in any case.\n\nWho is Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\nWe don\u2019t know their real name, but they are absurdly the most renowned person in the crypto world: who is Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, and what is their net worth? On 31 October 2008, on the crypto enthusiast website metzdowd.com, they shared the whitepaper of their cryptocurrency: \u2018A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u2019. This paper presents the philosophy and functioning of a decentralised digital currency, exchanged without the need for intermediaries (Peer-to-Peer), whose transactions are stored in a shared ledger (the blockchain), so as to prove the ownership of the coins and prevent attempts at \u2018double spending\u2019.\n\nOn 3 January 2009, the project came to fruition: Satoshi Nakamoto themselves created the genesis block of Bitcoin, inserting a message as a warning.\n\n\u201cThe Times 3 January 2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\u201d\n\nThis Times headline is iconic for the crisis years that motivated Bitcoin\u2019s creator. In a nutshell, Satoshi reflected on the fragility of the traditional financial system, dependent on trust in centralised authorities, and proposed an alternative based on cryptography.\n\nThis project perfectly represents who Satoshi Nakamoto is: a revolutionary who, having solved the problem of money, chose anonymity to give up control and return power to individuals. Bitcoin, in fact, does not need its creator to function, because its decentralised system is managed by a network of equal nodes, which follow the rules of an impartial algorithm.\n\nThe creator of Bitcoin: from forums to the Nobel Prize\n\nTheir willingness to remain anonymous has not stopped the curious people who, for years now, have been wondering who Satoshi Nakamoto is and trying to find out as many details about them as possible, such as their net worth. There is an entire archive of emails, forum posts and even quotes from the Bitcoin creator: a sort of \u2018digital identity\u2019, but one that describes a character in search of an author. We can appreciate their discussions on BitcoinTalk, the online space they founded. Here we find, for instance, exchanges of banter with Hal Finney, the cryptographer who defined the risk of double spending for Bitcoin.\n\nSatoshi\u2019s last post in this forum, dated 12 December 2010, emphasised the need to improve Bitcoin\u2019s protocol, but this is not their final message to the world. In fact, they later wrote other e-mails to two collaborators of the project: some to Mike Hearn, on 23 April 2011, after they gave the Bitcoin source code to Gavin Andresen:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve moved on to other things. It\u2019s in good hands with Gavin and everyone.\u201d\n\nThe second to Gavin himself, a few days later, saying not to speak of them as a \u2018mysterious figure\u2018, because it would have given Bitcoin the reputation of a \u2018pirate currency\u2018, but rather to emphasise the project being open-source. We do not know what Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s new interests are, but they probably withdrew from the scene to prevent their words from affecting the value of their creation. In any case, they were taken literally, because many still contribute freely to the development of Bitcoin\u2019s algorithm today.\n\nThe profile on the P2P Foundation forum, on the other hand, gives us perhaps the best clues: male, Japanese, 47 years old; probably fictitious data, but it has sparked speculation. So much so that, in 2014, an article was published in the online publication Newsweek recognising the creator of Bitcoin in Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, a 64-year-old Japanese programmer from California.\n\nIf we search online for \u2018who is Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019 we find the face of Dorian, but he himself has denied being the creator of the cryptocurrency. To confirm this, the real one broke his silence on the P2P forum: \u2018I am not Dorian Nakamoto\u2018. By contrast, in 2016 the Bitcoin creator did not comment on their nomination for the Nobel Prize in Economics, proposed by Bhagwan Chowdhry, a professor at California University. In the end, Satoshi did not win the Nobel, but even today the crypto community on Twitter is convinced they deserved it.\n\nWho is behind Satoshi Nakamoto: possible identities\n\nThe enigma concealing the name of Bitcoin\u2019s creator is more complex than mining calculations. However, crypto-enthusiasts never give up: searching for who Satoshi Nakamoto is, they have formulated several hypotheses.\n\nWe already know Hal Finney, the first person to receive a transaction in Bitcoin from Nakamoto in January 2009. Finney also helped overhaul BTC\u2019s software before it was launched. Unfortunately, in August 2014, he lost his battle against ALS, but decided to hibernate to see the future. For many, this sad event would explain the Bitcoin creator\u2019s silence since the Dorian affair.\n\nWe can still name Gavin Andresen among the candidates: in addition to receiving the source code, he was the creator of the first Bitcoin faucet, a site to distribute BTC via a sort of airdrop. If he were Satoshi Nakamoto, that would be a great way to redistribute his net worth!\n\nOther clues lead to Adam Back, identified as a possible Satoshi Nakamoto by the Financial Times in 2016. He is the cypherpunk and cryptographer who created the HashCash: Bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm, which is fundamental to recording transactions and producing blocks. Nakamoto also sent a preview of Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper to him and Wei Dai, the engineer who created b money, one of the first digital currency projects."

        "content": "Russia-linked cryptocurrency exchange Bitzlato has partially restored access to user funds despite being officially seized by European authorities.\n\nBitzlato has enabled its users to withdraw up to 50% of assets stuck on the platform due to enforcement from the United States and Europol, the firm announced on its Telegram channel on March 20.\n\nAccording to the statement, Bitzlato users can now restore half of their assets using the Telegram bot \u2014 bz_phoenix_bot \u2014 which allows users to move assets from the web Bitzlato account to an external wallet or exchange.\n\nAll withdrawals from Bitzlato are processed in Bitcoin (BTC), as the platform converted all altcoin holdings by users into BTC when the service was halted on Jan. 18. According to the firm, Bitzlato had to convert user balances to Bitcoin due to technical difficulties associated with servicing multiple altcoins after Bitzlato was seized.\n\nIn a public Bitzlato chat, several alleged Bitzlato users said they were able to move their Bitcoin to exchanges like ByBit and Binance. Some alleged Bitzlato clients also reportedly used software wallets like Trust Wallet and ViaBtc, and hardware wallets like Ledger, to withdraw their Bitcoin.\n\nBitzlato\u2019s 50% withdrawal option follows its previously announced roadmap on restoring users\u2019 access to the platform and resuming operations. According to the plan, Bitzlato will continue its work to restore the platform and aims to provide a service for peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency trading by early April 2023.\n\nA number of users have preferred not to withdraw 50% of their assets from Bitzlato this time, opting to wait until the exchange restores P2P trading. Once the P2P platform is restored, users will be able to access all previously available functions, a spokesperson for Bitzlato told Cointelegraph.\n\nBitzlato users should not expect to recover the remaining 50% of their assets once the P2P exchange is launched, the representative said.\n\n\u201cThere will be no second half once the P2P is opened since these are two unrelated questions and processes,\u201d the Bitzlato spokesperson added.\n\nRelated: Binance\u2019s response to U.S. Senators lacks financial information: Report\n\nAccording to the representative, the issue with client funds has not yet been resolved, but Bitzlato plans to return the money either by restoring access to seized funds by Europol or from the company\u2019s funds. The spokesperson said:\n\n\u201cLawyers have disputed the decision of the French government, and if the outcome is favorable, the funds will be returned [...] If it does not work out, the users have to wait until the firm earns enough to compensate for the losses.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the United States Department of Justice announced a major international crypto enforcement action against Bitzlato in mid-January. Europol subsequently said that European authorities seized more than $19 million in crypto from Bitzlato as part of the enforcement actions.\n\nMagazine: Crypto winter can take a toll on hodlers\u2019 mental health"

        "content": "Ark's Cathie Wood: Bitcoin's Strength Through Bank Crisis Will Attract Institutional Investors\n\nListen to the CoinMarketRecap podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Google Podcasts\n\nArk Invest's Cathie Wood predicted that Bitcoin's strength during the recent banking crisis will bring back institutional investors who have been pushed away by regulators focusing attention on the bitcoins on their balance sheets.\n\nBitcoin is up almost 70% this year and 21% this month as small crypto-friendly banks like Silvergate and Signature were lost along with Silicon Valley Bank, and even mainstream banks like First Republic and Credit Suisse have been hit hard enough to require big rescues and in the latter's case, a bargain basement buyout.\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg on March 21, Wood noted that \"one of the things that happens in a crisis is liquidity dries out so that that tends to hurt assets.\" But, she added:\n\nIn a recent report, Ark recommended that institutional investors interested in digital assets should target 2.5% to 6.5% to Bitcoin, she said.\n\n\"So not crazy,\" Wood added. She said:\n\nIn Ark's Big Ideas 2023 report, the base case Bitcoin price prediction was $682,000 by 2030, while the bear case was more than $250,000 and the bull case nearly $1.5 million.\n\nWood said the base case price, she believes, is \"quite conservative.\"\n\nLast week, Ark Invest revealed that it has raised $16 million for a new private crypto fund.\n\nMeanwhile, Wood, who has been buying swaths of Coinbase shares over the last few months, sold $13.5 million worth of COIN on March 21.\n\nThat's after Ark Invest bought about $30 million worth in February and another $30 million in the week of March 6. After its last buy, on March 10, Ark Invest owned 9.9 million shares of Coinbase. Wood has long been a strong supporter of Coinbase, despite its abysmal performance in 2022, when its share price declined 86%.\n\nThat said, she did make some big sells last year, dumping 1.4 million in July alone, although she bought a lot later in the year.\n\nSo what happened? Well, COIN is up almost 150% since the beginning of the year, closing at $83.99 on Tuesday after starting the year at $33.60. And it's up more than a third since March 10. So, while she is a long-term investor, a bit of profit taking does seem like a possibility."

Every big bank now has a substantive crypto desk, not just for trading, but for partnerships as well.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said that there\u2019s still a divide between traditional financial institutions and crypto firms, which has caused headwinds in institutional adoption over the last few months.\n\n\u201cHistorically, those big players have been the biggest drivers of innovation,\u201d he said, adding that the two sides are currently \u201cstuck in a bit of a rut\u201d and that the \u201cbig change\u201d won\u2019t happen until they stop fighting for superiority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not crypto versus Goldman Sachs or crypto versus institutions. It\u2019s a race to who can do crypto better.\u201d\n\nAs for the impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price from the institutional interest, Wood explained in the interview that ARK Invest\u2019s $1-1.5 million BTC price prediction by 2030 was made on the back of an institutional investor BTC allocation analysis, which estimates most firms would allocate between 2.5% to 6.5% to BTC in their investment portfolios.\n\n\u201cThese are the sorts of allocations that they would have made to emerging, new categories of assets like real estate in the 70s and small caps in the 80s and 90s,\u201d Wood added.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin holds $28K due to spot buying, but institutional investors are still selling\n\nARK Invest estimates the BTC price towards $1.5 million will be pushed by institutional investors allocating between 2.5-6.5% of their portfolio into BTC. Source: ARK Invest\n\nLinch, on the other hand, believes that \u201caggressive\u201d institutional adoption will come when opportunities become more easily identifiable:\n\n\u201cShow them a way that it can be done and it can make them money and I guarantee you they won\u2019t stand in the way of that. They\u2019ll be pedal to the metal to exploit that opportunity.\u201d\n\nPositive sentiment has surrounded Bitcoin following the collapses of Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature banks. BTC has surged 43.6% since its most recent low on March 11, compared with a 25.3% increase in the broader crypto market over that time, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nMagazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom"

Turmoil in the financial industry has extended through March, following the government-backed takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS in Switzerland, and escalating pressures on San Francisco-based First Republic Bank.\n\nThe logic behind bitcoin's gains seems to be tied to diminished confidence in the financial sector, causing investors to turn to the digital-asset industry which boasts benefits not offered by the US banking system \u2013 a decentralized currency.\n\n\"Bitcoin was launched with a mantra that the banking system was terrible, and the economy needed an alternative. So, the narrative is helping drive money into bitcoin with a 30% gain in the last week,\" Siegel said.\n\nOn Wednesday, bitcoin rose 0.82% to $28,269 in the 24 hours to 6:30 a.m. ET, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Since then, the popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals has surged.\n\nAccording to data from Dune analytics, between Feb. 1 and March 1, the total number of Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions surged from 679 to 240,000. As of March 21, a total of 567,087 have been inscribed.\n\n\u201cWe paid close attention to the release of Ordinal Theory and the lightning pace of adoption that soon followed,\u201d said Magic Eden, adding:\n\n\u201cOur marketplace was built within a month, culminating in a hackathon in California with over a dozen devs.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the marketplace only supports secondary sales of Bitcoin Ordinals. The marketplace said it is also looking into future tools that would allow creators to more easily mint or inscribe Bitcoin NFTs, such as its launchpad, which it offers for other chains.\n\nIn order to enable permissionless swaps, it uses partially signed Bitcoin transactions \u2014 a Bitcoin standard that allows multiple parties to sign the same transaction \u2014 rather than smart contracts.\n\nThe marketplace launched with over 70 collections. Source: Magic Eden\n\nMeanwhile, Magic Eden says while there will be no royalty support for the marketplace, it is \u201cactively looking\u201d into this, adding there is \u201cvery little tooling and no secure and trustless enforcement solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith no royalty standard today, we have decided to launch on Bitcoin without royalty support for now,\u201d said Magic Eden.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is most in-line with the ethos of the ecosystem, and despite this, we are actively looking into the development of an on-chain, permissionless royalty standard and are committed to working with creators and the greater community,\u201d it added.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin thought leaders weigh the pros and cons of Ordinals\n\nOther Bitcoin Ordinals marketplaces have already launched, including ORDX and Generative XYZ, which launched in February.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nMuch as it can be enjoyable to poke fun at the crypto bros \u2014 with their silly memes, irritating acronyms, puerile jokes and frankly ridiculous ideas about the world \u2014 I have to confess: I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re the main problem. As far as I\u2019m concerned it\u2019s the earnest, strait-laced types who insist that we should all be taking the whole thing terribly seriously who pose the biggest threat to our survival as a rational and prosperous society. Welcome to the plague of what I like to call \u201csensible crypto\u201d.\n\nWhat I am talking about when I use this oxymoron is the men in suits \u2014 and it is most commonly men, though there are women too \u2014 who will tell you that sure, the vast majority of cryptoland is a gigantic grift, but that their crypto coin is going to change the way we send money around the world, making the financial system fairer and more inclusive and democratic.\n\nIt\u2019s the political leaders who insist that we must embrace this noxious industry in order to stay at the cutting edge of innovation. It\u2019s the Wall Street types with money to lose who appear on CNBC to tell the less well-off that crypto is a safe place to put their money. And yes, it\u2019s the crypto exchange bosses who don\u2019t care about the Lambos and designer clothes; they just want to make a few billion dollars so they give it all away and make the world a better place.\n\nThese people lend credibility to a high-risk, opaque and ill-understood industry that should be thought of as something between a multilevel marketing scheme and a Ponzi scheme, that preys on \u2014 and indeed relies upon \u2014 those who cannot afford to gamble their money away.\n\nOne way these sensible crypto types exert influence is via central bank digital currencies. You might think these CBDCs should have little to do with crypto, given they would be centrally issued and controlled, and that cryptocurrencies are not used as money but as a means of speculating. And you would be right. But the argument for CBDCs \u2014 that they could allow for quicker, cheaper, more efficient transfers of money \u2014 is also one of the arguments pushed by crypto, and thus CBDCs pose a direct threat.\n\nThis week the Digital Pound Foundation will be holding an event, The Geopolitical Case for a Digital Pound, at which the Bank of England\u2019s head of future technology is due to speak. This follows last month\u2019s announcement that the BoE and Treasury are jointly designing a \u201cdigital pound\u201d that could replace cash by the end of this decade. This all sounds sensible enough.\n\nBut who are the Digital Pound Foundation? They pitch themselves as an \u201cindependent forum supporting the implementation of a well-designed digital pound\u201d, and say that their motive is to \u201cdrive forward the UK\u2019s transition to a digital economy\u201d. But they are probably more interested in driving forward crypto. The board of directors consists of three people: two founder-CEOs of relatively obscure crypto projects, and the \u201chead of policy\u201d at Ripple, the company behind the XRP token, who chairs the Digital Pound Foundation but who happens to be based in the global hub of the crypto lobbying industry: Washington DC.\n\n\u201cThe crypto industry\u2019s number one objective is to sell crypto . . . and to legitimise it,\u201d Martin Walker, a longtime crypto critic and the director of banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management, tells me. \u201cIf CBDCs actually took off . . . it would totally destroy one of the crypto narratives.\u201d\n\nRipple is an example of sensible crypto in its own right. This is a company that sells itself to banks as a payment settlement solution, whose CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in 2020 that \u201conce regulators understand you\u2019re not circumventing regulatory frameworks they get very comfortable very quickly\u201d. His confidence was misplaced: later that year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued the company, alleging that they had \u201craised over $1.3bn through an unregistered . . . digital asset securities offering\u201d. (Ripple has denied the claim, and the case is ongoing.)\n\nThe legitimisation of crypto is happening in UK politics too. Rishi Sunak suggested last year, while he was chancellor of the exchequer, that Britain should become a \u201cglobal cryptoassets hub\u201d. MPs have also established a \u201ccentral bank and digital currency\u201d all-party-parliamentary group whose secretariat is \u2014 surprise \u2014 a crypto company.\n\nThey might use real words and speak in complete sentences; they might turn up at banking conferences and speak sombrely about financial inclusion; but we must see this crypto crowd for what they really are: snake-oil salesmen in sensible clothing.\n\njemima.kelly@ft.com"

Like any traditional IRA, your contributions are tax deductible in the year you make them. You'll only pay taxes when you withdraw funds.\n\nJust remember that those tax savings require you to give up some flexibility. Since an IRA is a retirement account, withdrawals made before the age of 59 \u00bd will result in early withdrawal penalties and are subject to income taxes.\n\nLooking for more alternative assets?

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 17.5% rally between March 16 and 22 surprised options traders betting on price levels below $26,000. The movement resulted from investors seeking protection against persistent inflation and the ongoing banking crisis.\n\nBitcoin bulls have been paying close attention to the negative effects of near-zero interest rates between April 2020 and April 2022, and some have used the information to profit from the $1.2 billion in BTC options that are set to expire on March 24.\n\nResilient inflation and improving housing markets\n\nAccording to the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) released on March 22, Inflation in England unexpectedly increased to 10.4% in February due to higher food prices. This outcome is likely to prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates on March 23, thereby increasing the likelihood of a recession. A higher cost of capital is detrimental to businesses and families, but it is the only way to stem the rise in consumer prices.\n\nMeanwhile, existing home sales in the United States increased 14.5% in February, following the first annual price decline in over a decade. The numbers released on March 21 reflect the decrease in mortgage rates resulting from the increased demand for government bonds. In addition, the increase in sales suggests that the housing market has reached a price floor.\n\nInvestors frantically sought protection against monetary debasement as governments were forced to inject capital to prevent banking sector contagion. For example, the yield on five-year U.S. Treasurys decreased from 4.34% on March 8 to 3.6% on March 22, indicating increased demand for fixed-income instruments.\n\nIs the new world one where the prices of all assets are rising?\n\nConsumer prices continue to rise even as the S&P 500 reclaimed the 4,000 mark. Housing market demand is increasing, and gold gained 7.8% in 2023. Every asset with a chance to profit from inflation is increasing, a typical sign of fiat currency debasement.\n\nThe movement is not consistent with the macroeconomic scenario in which banks required emergency bailouts and major corporations were forced to lay off thousands of employees due to declining sales prospects. Therefore, a portion of Bitcoin\u2019s recent gains toward $28,000 is due to the weakening U.S. dollar.\n\nIf the fear of a recession continues to have a negative impact on risk markets, Bitcoin may struggle to maintain the price levels necessary for bulls to earn $380 million or more by March 24 when weekly options expire.\n\nData also shows that bears were caught by surprise as Bitcoin surpassed $26,000\n\nThe weekly BTC options expiry has $1.2 billion in open interest, but the actual figure will be lower because bears have concentrated their bets on Bitcoin trading below $26,000.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for March 24. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 1.17 call-to-put ratio reflects the difference in open interest between the $675 million call (buy) options and the $575 million put (sell) options. Bears were caught off guard on March 17 when Bitcoin\u2019s price surged above $26,000, so the likely outcome will be much lower than anticipated.\n\nFor instance, if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $27,700 on March 24 at 8:00 am UTC, there will be only $21 million in put (sell) options. This distinction arises due to the fact that the right to sell Bitcoin at $26,000 or $27,000 is null if BTC trades above that price on the expiry date.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price whipsaws as Fed says rate hikes may not be \u2018appropriate\u2019\n\nThe most likely outcomes favor bulls by a wide margin\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on March 24 for call (buy) and put (sell) instruments varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $25,000 and $26,000: 7,400 calls vs. 5,500 puts. The net result favors the call (buy) instruments by $50 million.\n\n7,400 calls vs. 5,500 puts. The net result favors the call (buy) instruments by $50 million. Between $26,000 and $27,000: 9,100 calls vs. 3,700 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $140 million.\n\n9,100 calls vs. 3,700 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $140 million. Between $27,000 and $28,000: 12,700 calls vs. 800 puts. Bulls increase their advantage to $330 million.\n\n12,700 calls vs. 800 puts. Bulls increase their advantage to $330 million. Between $28,000 and $29,000: 14,300 calls vs. 20 puts. Bulls' advantage increases to $405 million.\n\nThis rough estimate considers only call options in bullish bets and put options in neutral-to-bearish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a certain price, but this effect is difficult to estimate.\n\nBears can only reduce their losses, so they are likely to throw in the towel and concentrate on the $3.8 billion monthly expiry on March 31. However, based on the weekly options data, bulls are in a great position to profit at least $330 million.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

We\u2019re going through an anthropological change, which is hard for people. A lot of people resist it.\u201d\n\nHe continued by saying that weak leaders will be revealed by those who resist it. Whereas strong leaders embrace it and are looking for this change. He concluded his speech with a three-minute song, which he wrote and performed.\n\nAccording to Draper, the song was written four years ago but is more relevant than ever today. It touched on Satoshi, Bitcoin, banks, governments and the want for a new world order.\n\nRelated: Paris Blockchain Week 2023: First day of the Summit kicks off\n\nBefore he began, he dedicated the song to SVB and \u201call the banks that have failed and will fail.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I dedicated to all those governments that if they don\u2019t trust their people and set them free, they will also fail, and their currencies will also fail.\n\nThe song got a round of applause from the audience, as well as the panelists who followed Draper on the master stage.\n\nHe concluded his time by saying blockchain, Bitcoin and smart contracts are making up one of the \u201cgreatest transitions in the history of the world,\u201d and it should be embraced."

        "title": "Bitcoin's layers - Coinbase",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s development landscape is currently populated by several strategies to enhance the functionality and scalability of the network. These approaches, however, have some key fundamental differences in terms of their architecture, intended utility, and ease of deployment. In this report, we explore the design space for Bitcoin\u2019s \u201clayers\u201d and attempt to characterize the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches currently in development. In our view, the Lightning Network (a layer-2 protocol) has an advantage over alternative scaling approaches because it leverages bitcoin as the native asset. Other solutions introduce external blockchains (or sidechains), new tokens, and bridges that require a trusted third-party, but the Lightning Network is simply a peer-to-peer communications network that interacts directly with Bitcoin\u2019s base layer. The Lightning Network is not without its own issues and limitations, but as a Bitcoin-native solution, it has achieved greater social consensus amongst the Bitcoin development community. This has helped catalyze a growing ecosystem of applications and projects with real-world utility ranging from remittances to content monetization.\n\nBackground Within the context of the blockchain trilemma, the Bitcoin base layer has been optimized for security and decentralization, at the expense of scalability. The network is rate-limited to produce finalized blocks of transactions every ~10 minutes which can be large \u2013 up to 4 megabytes (MB) in size (including up to 1MB of transaction data and 3MB of signature data). On one hand, these limitations are critical in supporting the security and decentralization of the network, as they allow the barriers to entry for participating in protocol consensus to remain low enough (in terms of computation, storage and bandwidth) to be truly permissionless and secure. Conversely, the throughput limitations (~7 transactions per second) inherent to Bitcoin\u2019s base layer make micropayments largely impractical and have historically prevented the protocol from fulfilling a role as an effective medium of exchange. In order to transcend the \u201cdigital gold\u201d narrative and become an effective medium of exchange (able to service billions of users), bitcoin\u2019s infrastructure must scale to facilitate higher throughput and lower cost transactions. That is, as new bitcoin issuance declines (i.e. lower rewards), it\u2019s possible that miners could feel less incentivized to secure the network, and we believe they would need to be compensated by fees generated by demand for blockspace. Therefore, we believe future demand for blockspace will play an important role in the long-term security of the network. Importantly, the result of the block size war in 2017 further ossified the base layer of Bitcoin. One outcome of the block size war was the activation of the SegWit (Segregated Witness) soft fork, which \u201cincreased\u201d the block size by separating the witness data from the transaction data, thus enabling more transactions per block (from 1650 to 2700). (Incidentally, it was this change that ultimately allowed the Lightning Network to be developed.) The success of the \u201csmall-block\u201d cohort ensured that Bitcoin\u2019s block size would not be increased (beyond the limits made possible by SegWit) in order to facilitate higher throughput, thereby placing an emphasis on scalability via layered approaches.\n\nThe \"layer\" landscape The Lightning Network is just one approach to enhancing the scalability of the Bitcoin network. Detailed in Table 1 is a comparison of the most prominent layer-based scaling strategies currently in development. The fundamental difference between the Lightning Network and the alternative strategies (highlighted in gray) is that these layers \u2013 whether they be sidechains, independent layer-1s or rollups \u2013 currently rely on trusted \u201cpegging\u201d mechanisms to deposit/withdraw bitcoin to/from the external execution environments. Further, they typically introduce a separate token that is representative of bitcoin, which could be considered more of an abstraction relative to a network like Lightning which leverages the actual native asset. These alternative approaches also differ from Lightning in that their intended utility is oriented towards more expressive smart contracts that go beyond the capabilities of Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language and facilitate specific applications such as liquidity pools, decentralized lending pools, NFT marketplaces, and automated market makers (AMMs). Conversely, Lightning represents more of a Bitcoin-native solution that utilizes the native asset and its corresponding scripting language (Script) to enable near-instantaneous and low-cost payments, which can be applied to a variety of useful applications. Table 1. Comparison of various approaches to scaling Bitcoin (project links: Lightning / Liquid / Rootstock / Stacks / Rollkit ) The eventual goal in terms of future development for these alternative approaches (outside of Lightning) is to create a decentralized (trustless) pegging mechanism or bridge. Stacks is one such approach that recently unveiled an updated whitepaper that aims to facilitate the permissionless use of bitcoin in an external execution environment. Separately, Bitcoin developer John Light recently published a research paper as part of the Human Rights Foundation\u2019s ZK-Rollup Research Fellowship that explores the potential of implementing zero-knowledge (ZK) proof technology on Bitcoin. As his research suggests, ZK rollups (or validity rollups as he calls them) could theoretically facilitate a trustless pegging mechanism or bridge, but would likely require new opcodes (operation codes, specific commands capable within Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language) such as proof verification and recursive covenants to be implemented via Bitcoin Implementation Proposals (BIPs). As BIPs necessitate a soft fork of the protocol, these solutions will need to achieve significant social consensus before they can be actualized. Lightning, on the other hand, requires no changes to the Bitcoin base layer in order to function in a trustless manner. Accordingly, developers can readily build applications and projects that leverage the Lightning Network and be confident they\u2019ll be able to easily deploy their ideas to the masses. Moreover, because building on Lightning does not require changes to the Bitcoin base layer, it is less likely to threaten the ongoing ossification of Bitcoin\u2019s existing protocol rules, which helps support bitcoin\u2019s reliability as a store of value asset.\n\nUnderneath the hood of Lightning The Lightning Network consists of nodes running software that allows peer-to-peer transactions via bidirectional multisignature Bitcoin addresses that act as payment channels. (A multisignature address is a specific type of Bitcoin address that requires multiple private keys in order to authorize a transaction; the typical structure is referred to as \u201cm-of-n\u201d where \u201cn\u201d is the total number of private keys associated with the address, and \u201cm\u201d is the minimum number of private keys required to sign a given transaction.) Functionally similar to bar tabs that must be reconciled at the end of the night, payment channels can be opened by creating a two-party (2-of-2) multisignature address and funding said address with a certain amount of bitcoin via a base layer transaction. Once a channel is open and funded with bitcoin (representing the upper limit of transactional capacity for the channel), the two parties can conduct an unlimited number of transactions for very low cost. Transactions within a channel are conducted \u201coff-chain.\u201d When users want to close the payment channel, only the net change in value between the two parties is finalized via a single base layer transaction. Importantly, the architecture of the Lightning Network protocol allows for the routing of payments across the network of interconnected nodes and corresponding payment channels. This means that users can send and receive payments to and from Lightning addresses without having to create a dedicated payment channel between two parties. Lightning achieves this routing process by implementing a specific type of Bitcoin transaction called a Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC). A HTLC is a type of smart contract that combines two cryptographic concepts \u2013 hashlocks and timelocks \u2013 to ensure payments can be trustlessly routed across multiple \u201chops\u201d to and from intermediary channels. This structure suggests that the effectiveness of the network is directly a function of the number of users participating in the network, as they are additive to the overall liquidity of the network as well as the number of available routing destinations.\n\nImproving the infrastructure Despite its architectural advantages, Lightning is not without its own issues and limitations. Intricacies associated with managing payment channels and maintaining appropriate liquidity can be burdensome for individual users. As a result, the network is susceptible to denial-of-service and Sybil attacks (attempts to control a network by creating multiple fake identities), as well as other vulnerabilities related to potentially malicious counterparties. In order to protect themselves from dishonest actors, Lightning users can utilize \u201cjustice transactions\u201d which serve as a punitive mechanism involving the closure of a lightning channel that may be under attack. Moreover, users can outsource these protective measures to \u201cwatchtowers,\u201d third-party services that charge a fee to monitor specific Lightning channels. Bitcoin and Lightning developers are acutely aware of these challenges to usability and are working to improve the infrastructure of the network. One such open-source project called the Lightning Development Kit (initially supported by Chaincode Labs and Spiral). It aims to help developers more easily integrate Lightning functionality into user-friendly applications. A specialized library of APIs, the LDK meaningfully reduces the friction for developers to build and launch applications that can further expand the usability of the Lightning Network. Separately, an important factor in Lightning payments being reliable is the aggregate liquidity of channels across the network. A recently announced initiative from TBD (a Bitcoin-focused subsidiary of Block) called \u201cc=\u201d aims to create an enterprise-grade \u201cLightning Service Provider \u201d (LSP) to bolster channel liquidity accessible to the network. In other words, c= has committed to contributing bitcoin liquidity to the network in order to run a dedicated routing node that can be utilized by individuals and businesses alike. Initiatives like this that support the usability of Lightning will be critical to the maturation of the network and are helping catalyze the proliferation of Lightning-enabled applications.\n\nMeasuring adoption growth Lightning adoption and activity have been steadily increasing, with aggregate channel capacity hovering around all-time highs (currently ~5,480 BTC, or ~US$153M, as shown in Chart 1). While this growth trajectory is encouraging, the channel capacity of the network (a proxy for user activity) is still relatively small compared to the user activity on a network like Ethereum which has a current total-value-locked (TVL) of ~US$29B. Nevertheless, Lightning channel capacity compares favorably to the TVL of the aforementioned scaling alternatives such as Stacks and Rootstock, as shown in Chart 2. It is also worth noting that because Lightning channels are not required to be made public, the available data on channel capacity likely understates the entirety of network activity (an estimated ~30% of channels are private). Further, there are roughly ~18k active Lightning nodes at current, up over 116% since the start of 2021. Another important gauge of Lightning adoption is merchant and corporate integrations. Enterprises such as Shopify , Clover , and Robinhood have announced their intentions to support Lightning-based payments for their respective merchants and users. Chart 1. Lightning channel capacity (BTC and USD) Chart 2. Comparison of TVL (channel capacity for Lightning) Perhaps the most insightful signal of adoption, however, is the emergence of a diverse ecosystem of Lightning-enabled applications in recent years. Detailed in Table 2 are several innovative projects that are leveraging the Lightning Network in some capacity to broaden the utility of bitcoin. Notably, several of these initiatives represent potential solutions to real-world problems including reducing frictions for remittances/cross-border payments, empowering content creators to more effectively monetize their work, and fostering censorship-resistant social networks. Table 2. Key projects leveraging the Lightning Network (project links: Strike / Fedimint / Fedipool / Synota / Nostr / Fountain / Wavlake / Mash / Kollider / Taro ) (please also see our report Bitcoin Fedimints ) The efforts detailed above stand in contrast to the applications currently being built on alternative scaling platforms, many of which simply replicate certain products and services already available on dedicated smart contract platforms like Ethereum. For instance, the most popular application on Stacks is a DEX platform called ALEX which accounts for ~93% of the network\u2019s TVL. Similarly, a lending application called MoneyOnChain accounts for ~62% of Rootstock\u2019s TVL. Broadly speaking, sidechains and rollups are more oriented towards expressive smart contracts and programming languages to enable DeFi-like applications, while Lightning is more purely focused on fostering an effective payments layer for Bitcoin. That said, Lightning Network development is supporting more than just payments applications \u2013 Fedimint and Fedipool are important examples of leveraging the Lightning Network to build trust-minimized custody solutions and reduce centralization risks for mining pools, respectively.\n\nConclusions While far from perfect, the Lightning Network is integral to the future of Bitcoin in that it promises to broaden the utility of the protocol beyond a store of value without needing to infringe upon any existing protocol rules. Moreover, one could argue that some of the most impactful projects in terms of real-world utility are being built on the Lightning Network. Importantly, these projects are complementary to the Bitcoin network and can function with the existing native asset and corresponding scripting language. Alternative scaling solutions \u2013 those that introduce external chains, new tokens, or bridges \u2013 differ from the Lightning Network in terms of their architecture, intended utility, and ease of deployment. For these reasons, we believe the Lightning Network is well positioned to remain the focal point of future Bitcoin development. Nevertheless, we feel the various approaches being pursued to build incremental functionality and usability atop the Bitcoin base layer should not be dilutive to one another. While we believe that the Lightning Network possesses some critical advantages relative to its alternatives, we do not view the landscape for Bitcoin\u2019s scalability as winner-take-all. Each approach brings its own set of tradeoffs, and they all share the common goal of broadening the utility of bitcoin and represent sources of potential future demand for blockspace. Overall, we believe the design space for Bitcoin\u2019s layers is more vibrant than most realize and the network should benefit from the diversity of scaling approaches being developed."

        "content": "FILE PHOTO: A representation of bitcoin is seen in an illustration picture\n\nBy Evan Garcia and Dan Fastenberg\n\nMCCAMEY, Texas (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency bankruptcies and worries over electric power consumption have failed to dent the industry's growth in Texas, according to a top trade group, citing the rise in the miners' power demands.\n\nBitcoin miners consume about 2,100 megawatts of the state's power supplies, said Lee Bratcher, president of industry group Texas Blockchain Council. That power usage rose 75% last year and was nearly triple that of the prior 12 months, Bratcher said.\n\nThose demands amount to about 3.7% of the state's lowest forecast peak load this year, according to data from grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).\n\n\"There's been some challenges with the Bitcoin mining industry,\" Bratcher said, noting his group recently saw two prominent bankruptcies and other miners scaling back expansions.\n\nThe industry also faces new federal regulations, including a proposed 30% tax on electricity usage for digital mining and calls by the U.S. Treasury secretary and commodities regulator for a regulatory framework.\n\nNew York this year imposed a ban on some cryptocurrency mining that runs on fossil fuel-generated power. Other states are expected to follow suit.\n\nBut in Texas, some counties have offered tax incentives and miners continue to be drawn to its wind and solar power, which could supply about 39% of ERCOT's energy needs in 2023.\n\n\"Bitcoin mining is a very energy intensive business, which is why we tend to find places like West Texas to be full of Bitcoin miners,\" said Matt Prusak, chief commercial officer at cryptocurrency miner U.S. Bitcoin Corp, which has one of its mining operations in a 280-megawatt wind farm in Texas.\n\nIts McCamey, Texas, site last month consumed 173,000 megawatt hours of power \u2013 about 60% provided by the grid and nearly 40% from the nearby wind farm. The average American home uses about 10 MWh in a year, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Texas, where about 250 people died during a winter storm blackout that exposed the fragility of the state's grid, the prospect of higher crypto demand has raised alarms.\n\n\"There are a lot of Bitcoin mines that are trying to connect to the system,\" said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. \"If all of them were to connect in the timelines that they are looking to connect, then it probably would present an issue to the grid because that load would be growing way faster than it ever has before.\"\n\n(Reporting by Evan Garcia and Dan Fastenberg; writing by Laila Kearney; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

        "content": "Benjamin Von Wong, acclaimed photographer, multimedia artist, and activist, built an 11-foot tall skull, the \u201cSkull of Satoshi,\u201d covered in electronic waste (E-waste) to \u201cexpose Bitcoin\u2019s impact on climate change.\u201d\n\nWhile everything people do online consumes energy, Bitcoin mining and transactions are especially energy-hungry activities. Researchers at the University of New Mexico found that Bitcoin\u2019s environmental footprint is similar to extracting and refining crude oil.\n\nVon Wong notes that while a single Google search consumes about 1,080 Joules of energy, just one Bitcoin transaction consumes a disastrous 6,995,000,000 Joules. That\u2019s nearly 6.5 million times more energy than Googling something and nearly 24,300 times more energy than streaming an hour of Netflix consumes.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s energy problem is significant. However, it\u2019s not an unsolvable problem, argues Von Wong. Software changes could instantly clean up Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, many people don\u2019t fully understand Bitcoin and even those who use Bitcoin might not realize the damage it causes and how it affects climate change. Von Wong\u2019s latest project is designed to bring attention to the issue. He has regularly used stunning art and photography to raise awareness of social and environmental issues. Last year, one of Von Wong\u2019s images became the symbol of the United Nations\u2019 global plastic treaty. It wasn\u2019t Von Wong\u2019s first foray into raising awareness about the detrimental effects of plastic and pollution. In 2016, he created a stunning photo of a mermaid that had been beached by plastic bottles.\n\nVon Wong\u2019s fight against E-waste is another example of the photographer\u2019s ambitious ideas, passion, and excellent execution. Bitcoin uses about twice as much energy as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple combined. Bitcoin energy demands have increased by 100 times in the last five years.\n\nThe giant skull at the center of Von Wong\u2019s new image was built using wood, recycled Styrofoam, and over 300 pieces of electronic waste. Von Wong worked alongside a mechanical engineer, Jeremy, and fabricators Elana and Joel. The E-waste they used arrived courtesy of nonprofit Unirecycle.\n\nBitcoin mining generates more than 30,000 tons of E-waste annually, so Von Wong wanted to cover the piece in circuit boards. It was a monumental task, as the team needed to manually sort, organize, and fit every part onto the skull.\n\nThe \u201cSkull of Satoshi\u201d took about 1,000 hours of work and was brought to life in an abandoned warehouse. The building, used with permission by a demolition company hired to dismantle the structure, gives the images a dystopian, gritty vibe. Long tube lights add a cyberpunk feel to the shots.\n\nVon Wong included models in suits in the work because these are the people he hopes to reach. Institutional and financial investors support Bitcoin at the expense of the climate. The skull\u2019s eyes feature red lasers as an allusion to the \u201claser eye\u201d profile pictures used by some Bitcoin supporters. Von Wong even created laser eyes for his volunteer models to wear using red fairy lights.\n\nOver the next few months, the giant \u201cSkull of Satoshi\u201d will travel as part of the campaign for sustainable Bitcoin as Greenpeace will take it on tour. Many people were involved in the campaign, and a full list of credits is available on Benjamin Von Wong\u2019s blog.\n\nImage credits: Benjamin Von Wong."

However, Leonidas believes such concerns are unwarranted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBlockchains solve the problem of provenance for digital art so there is no debate about whether the official Bored Ape Yacht Club holders are the holders of the original and Bored Apes\u2014anybody can verify that ownership on-chain,\u201d Leonidas explained. \u201cThis is just another derivative project of an iconic PFP collection that in my opinion just spreads the culture of the original PFP collection to even more people which ends up driving value back down to the official holders.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are actually doing the original Bored Ape Yacht Club holders a favor by storing all 10,000 images fully on-chain for the first time so that they will live on forever on Bitcoin at zero cost to the official holders or Yuga,\u201d Leonidas said.\n\nWhile holders of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs may not be paying to inscribe their digital collectibles on Bitcoin, the floor price of Bitcoin Apes is steadily rising.\n\nThe floor price for Bitcoin Apes is 0.0101 BTC, around $285.00; on Ordinals Wallet, the floor price is 0.21 ETH, around $380.00 on Ordinals Market. Bored Ape Yacht Club Ethereum NFT, in comparison, has a floor price of 57.5 ETH, around $104,036 on OpenSea."

        "title": "How to Turn Your Bitcoin into Cash - GOBankingRates",
        "content": "D-Keine / iStock.com\n\nIt has been anything but a dull year for cryptocurrency \u2014 from the recent shutdown of a major exchange to the collapse of three financial institutions with a significant hand in the cryptocurrency market: Silvergate Capital, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The crypto market has seen a lot of volatility as a result, all during a period of heightened economic pressure.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that investors are wondering: How do you convert bitcoin to cash?\n\nHow Do I Cash Out My Bitcoin?\n\nYou have several options for trading in your bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency. Which option is best for you will depend on where you bought and stored your coins, how quickly you need the value back out of them and the nature of your approach to buying and liquidating investment assets.\n\nHere are five tried-and-true tactics for converting your bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to cash.\n\n1. Sell Bitcoin on a Cryptocurrency Exchange or Trading Platform\n\nUnless you\u2019ve locked your bitcoin, as you might do with what\u2019s known as staking, you can sell your bitcoin on an exchange at any time. You\u2019ll need to have an account with the exchange and move your crypto onto the platform before you sell. Make sure you pay attention to the fees associated, because those can vary by exchange or platform.\n\nIf you bought your bitcoin through an online investment house like Robinhood or eToro, you can sell through that firm for the corresponding broker\u2019s fee.\n\n2. Find a Bitcoin ATM\n\nCryptocurrency ATMs are becoming more and more available, and many \u2014 but not all \u2014 of them will allow you to sell your bitcoin and withdraw cash after following several security steps. This option is best saved for situations when you need cash fast, as the fees can be high \u2014 think up to 20%.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\n3. Spend It\n\nDebit cards that let you spend your crypto on everyday purchases are becoming increasingly mainstream. Transaction fees can vary, so do your homework before getting a crypto debit card.\n\nSome retailers will also take payment for their products or services directly from your digital wallet on a cryptocurrency exchange or platform.\n\n4. Send It to Another Investor in Return for Cash\n\nMost cryptocurrency exchanges offer peer-to-peer lending platforms, which could allow you to find a buyer for the bitcoin you\u2019d like to sell.\n\nMost importantly, you need to trust your potential buyer. There\u2019s always a chance that the cryptocurrency you transfer could reach your buyer before their cash deposits into your bank or PayPal account \u2014 so know as much as you can about who you\u2019re thinking about doing business with.\n\n5. Sell It Right From Your Crypto Wallet\n\nIf your crypto is securely stored in your cold wallet, you can sell it \u2014 for a fee \u2014 without moving it first. This will prevent you from having to transfer your crypto out of the wallet and onto a cryptocurrency exchange to make the sale.\n\nLedger and Trezor both offer bitcoin sales directly from your wallet.\n\nHow Do I Convert Bitcoin to Cash Instantly?\n\nThe process of liquidating your bitcoin quickly depends on how and where it\u2019s stored, but your best bet for going from crypto to cash in short order will most likely be via debit card, ATM card or expenditures at bitcoin-accepting retailers.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that transaction fees may apply for any method of converting your crypto to cash, but the fees are likely to get higher the faster the conversation needs to happen.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nCan I Cash Out Bitcoin to My Bank Account?\n\nYes, it\u2019s possible to move your bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to your bank account by selling it.\n\nIf you\u2019re not in a hurry, you can choose between two methods. Either pick a pre-set platform \u2014 like a cryptocurrency ATM or debit card \u2014 or find a buyer online and complete the sale on the blockchain or exchange. The latter process mandates trust and timely communication from both parties.\n\nMind the Bottom Line When Cashing In Cryptocurrency\n\nAlthough you have multiple choices to liquidate your bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into cash, it\u2019s essential to know what the associated fees and risks are.\n\nIf you\u2019re using a crypto ATM or debit card, you\u2019ll want to understand the fees associated with your transaction. If you decide to sell your coins to someone else, you may need to face the unknown \u2014 delays and fraud can be associated with online transactions like this. You could transfer your bitcoin to its buyer and find that they never intended to pay.\n\nProceed with caution, and be mindful of not only the opportunity you\u2019re pursuing, but also the potential downsides."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens saw some profit booking on Thursday as the increased interest rates dragged the riskier assets lower. The US Federal Reserve increased the interest rate by another 25 basis points, shunning the hopes that it would turn dovish amid the banking crisis.\n\nHowever, the US Fed signaled that a pause in the rate hikes is on the cards any time soon, but ruled out any possibilities of a rate cut in the ongoing years. Overall, the risk-averse sentiments weighed on the crypto assets as the jitters returned.\n\nBitcoin dropped sharply after the interest rate hikes as the largest crypto token slipped below the $28,000 mark and was holding near $27,300. Its largest peer Ethereum was also down about 4 per cent, falling below the $,1750 level. Pain in the altcoins was severe.\n\nBarring the US dollar-pegged USD Coin and Litecoin, all other top crypto tokens were trading with big cuts on Thursday. Tron plunged 10 per cent, whereas XRP tumbled 9 per cent. Solana and BNB were down 5 per cent, each. The sole gainer, Litecoin, surged about 7 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply lower at $1.15 trillion, dropping as much as 3 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes inched up about 2 per cent, close to $68.05 billion.\n\n\n\nThe Bitcoin rally was interrupted by the interest rate hike of 25 basis points announced by the Fed in the latest FOMC meeting, said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin. \"Bitcoin and Ethereum while other digital assets followed a similar trend.

        "content": "Crypto investment manager Bitwise Asset Management has unveiled a new ETF in the US which provides exposure to bitcoin futures while utilizing an advanced rolling strategy in a bid to enhance returns.\n\nThe Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF (BITC US) has been listed on NYSE Arca with a management fee of 0.85%.\n\nThe fund offers investors regulated, professionally managed exposure to bitcoin through investing in standardized, cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThe ETF seeks to outperform traditional bitcoin futures ETFs by minimizing potential pricing inefficiencies that can emerge in ETFs focused on front-month bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nSpecifically, front-month bitcoin futures ETFs may experience a performance drag if the bitcoin futures market is exhibiting a steep contango curve (where the forward price of the front-month contract is trading well above the spot price), forcing investors to suffer a significant negative roll yield as they sell their cheaper contracts to buy more expensive ones.\n\nOptimized roll strategies aim to limit potential losses arising from rolling futures contracts in contango markets and maximize the benefit from rolling contracts in backwardation (where the forward price of the front-month contract is trading below the spot price).\n\nIn terms of BITC\u2019s strategy, on a monthly basis, the ETF will consider all available contracts subject to liquidity requirements, selecting the contract maturity that exhibits the highest implied roll yield under current market conditions.\n\nMatt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise Asset Management, commented: \u201cHistorically, optimum roll strategies in other asset classes, such as oil and natural gas futures, have outperformed strategies focused on front-month or near-month contracts over time. We believe this same strategy can apply to the bitcoin futures market as it continues to deepen and evolve. With the Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF, we\u2019re excited to cater to long-term-oriented investors looking for regulated vehicles to gain directional bitcoin exposure.\u201d\n\nThe ETF may be utilized by investors as a satellite holding as bitcoin\u2019s distinct return pattern and historically low correlation to traditional stocks and bonds can offer long-term diversification benefits to portfolios.\n\nAdditionally, Bitwise notes that the fund\u2019s structure as an SEC-regulated, \u201c1940 Act\u201d ETF is the format that is preferred by financial advisors seeking bitcoin exposure with a recent survey showing that over two-thirds (68%) of advisors favour the vehicle. Moreover, for tax reporting, the fund will issue a Form 1099 instead of the typically longer and more complex K-1.\n\nHunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, said: \u201cIf there\u2019s anything this past year has reinforced, it\u2019s that how you invest in crypto is as important as what you invest in. The Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF gives institutions, advisors, and their clients a professional, regulated solution for adding exposure to bitcoin returns while bypassing the risks of custodying bitcoin directly or investing through novel platforms.\u201d"

        "content": "Analysts agree that BTC could trade above $30,000 before a notable drawback.\n\nThe $1 million prediction by Balaji is unlikely, but short-term direction depends on FOMC.\n\nIn 2022, several analysts, at different intervals, gave their opinion on Bitcoin [BTC] hitting rock bottom. And on many occasions, the king coin did not agree with the analysts, even though some issues like the FTX collapse played a part in subsequent price drops.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nFast forward to 2023. It could seem that some of those calls were wrong, as BTC had only fared better. According to CryptoQuant analyst BaroVirtual, the condition of the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) age bands was instrumental to the strides recorded in the new year.\n\nCan BTC sustain the green?\n\nThe UTXO Age Bands summarizes the behavior of short and long-term holders in view of the macro shift in influence among both parties. The analyst opined that there was a bearish crossover between the 6 million to 12 million and 12 million to 18 million age bands. This confirmed the early bullish signal before the press time reflection.\n\nAn explanation of the data above points to the fact that new buyers within the longer UTXO age bands have emerged. This fostered the position for a further long-term HODL and has helped support BTC price action.\n\nHowever, BaroVirtual mentioned that BTC risks a bearish stance in the mid-term. Although he pointed out that the sell-off might not occur until BTC hits between $30,000 or $33,000 or in unusual circumstances, $37,000 to $40,000 region.\n\nThe analyst also defended his position by referring to the historically even bearish years and odd bullish seasons. He noted that he doesn\u2019t expect the potential second uptrend to be better than the first quarter, stating:\n\n\u201cBitcoin lives in 4-year cycles from one halving to another. An even year is a bear, and an odd year is a bull. Therefore, 2023 is bullish, but the 2nd uptrend in the cycle is always weaker than the 1st; that is, the previous historical high is not updated\u201d\n\n$30,000 or nothing because\u2026\n\nIn another historical data reference, Gigisulivan, another CryptoQuant analyst, pointed to the Short-Term Holder SOPR. This metric tracks coin movements and the status of investors selling at a loss or profit.\n\nThe analyst noted the metric was at its highest point since November 2021. At press time, the Short-Term Holder SOPR was 1.027. Since the value was above 1, it indicated that short-term investors were selling at a profit.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nHowever, Gigisulivan added that in bear market exits, the metric increase was a sign of a further uptrend instead of a decline. Like BaroVirtual, he also mentioned that BTC could rise above $30,000.\n\nAt the same time, he said the $1 million 90-day Bitcoin prediction of Coinbase\u2019s former CTO was unachievable. Meanwhile, the short-term BTC movement would also depend on the outcome of the FOMC meeting."

        "title": "Ethereum as a deflationary asset, explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is a deflationary cryptocurrency? Although cryptocurrencies are often promoted as investment opportunities, their primary purpose was originally to serve as an alternative form of currency. Considering this narrative, the rules of supply and demand apply to cryptocurrencies as to fiat currencies. An undergraduate economics student might say the basics of money, economy and market forces is balancing supply and demand. How much of an asset is in circulation versus the demand \u2014 how many people want that particular asset \u2014 helps decide its price. This equation between supply and demand underlies the fundamentals of all economies and also applies to cryptocurrencies. Deflationary cryptocurrency is one where the value of the crypto increases due to a reduction or stagnation in supply. This ensures that the coin\u2019s market value is attractive for more people to invest in and can be used as a store of value. While deflationary cryptocurrencies look more attractive, not all are designed that way. Many well-known cryptocurrencies are not deflationary. In addition, there is often no supply limit to them. Some are disinflationary because inflation gradually reduces over time due to its tokenomics. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, won\u2019t be deflationary until all 21 million coins have been mined. Ether (ETH) was not deflationary until the \u201cMerge\u201d happened in September 2022. Related: Inflationary vs. deflationary cryptocurrencies, Explained\n\nHow does Ethereum fare against other deflationary tokens? Developers of tokens create deflationary mechanisms during the design of the economic model behind the token. The economic model \u2014 tokenomics \u2014 can be fundamental to how stakeholders add and accrue value in a Web3 ecosystem. The supply and demand dynamics of a token are decided at the level of development. Deflationary characteristics like burn mechanisms are decided as the economic model underlying the token is being developed. This can be a point-in-time process like with Bitcoin or an evolving mechanism like with Ethereum. When creating Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto ensured there would only be a finite supply of 21 million. Once 21 million Bitcoin are mined, no new BTC can be created. This limited supply has helped the narrative that Bitcoin is a true store of value compared with fiat currencies that increase supply due to central bank monetary policies. In contrast, Ethereum had an inflationary supply at its inception. Ether supply was increasing at an annual rate of 4.5%. However, after the Ethereum Merge that saw it move from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, it is now a non-inflationary asset due to its burn rate. The number of Ether burned in maintaining the network activity is more than the amount of Ether entering circulation. Implementing the EIP-1559 protocol has altered the economic nature of the Ethereum token by incorporating the burning of a fraction of the gas fees per transaction. As a result, some experts argue that Ethereum has become more deflationary than Bitcoin. As deflationary tokens are considered a better store of value, new tokens created for both protocol and application tiers may be designed to be deflationary.\n\nHas Ethereum\u2019s transition to a deflationary token made it a more desirable asset? Investments in deflationary cryptocurrencies can yield growth and returns for investors. But being deflationary alone may not be a criterion to be identified as a better investment. Due to their supply cap, deflationary tokens are typically perceived as more valuable by holders and investors. This was also demonstrated by the rise of nonfungible tokens (NFTs), where the rarity of the NFTs often decided the prices. Limited supply driving prices higher was also true with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), where some three-digit ENS names were sold for even more than 100 ETH. Ethereum may not necessarily be classified as a better asset after it became deflationary. Ethereum has a rich ecosystem that drives transactions on the chain, and as more Ether gets burned in the process, it causes deflation. An unused Ethereum blockchain wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve this economic feat. The underlying chain fundamentals must remain strong for Ethereum to thrive as an investment. A chain with strong fundamentals typically has a developer ecosystem to create many applications that users widely adopt. As users flock to these applications, developers are encouraged to continue innovating. The resulting network effect would make Ethereum deflationary, making it a more attractive investment asset."

        "content": "Longstanding Australian crypto exchange Independent Reserve has bought Bitcoin.com.au for $3 million, taking advantage of the depressed crypto environment to acquire the 100,000-strong customer list and brand while also bracing for a wave of new retail interest following a global banking crisis.\n\nCrypto prices have rebounded after a tough 12 months. The collapse of several US banks and the emergency buyout of Credit Suisse by UBS at the weekend have caused Bitcoin to jump 30 per cent over a fortnight and sparked hopes of a new round of quantitative easing from the US Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this big expectation that the Fed is going to have to print more money to give to the banks, so risk assets like Bitcoin respond very well,\u201d Adrian Przelozny, chief executive of Independent Reserve, said.\n\nAdrian Przelozny, CEO of crypto exchange Independent Reserve, has just bought Bitcoin.com.au for $3 million. Louis Douvis\n\n\u201cBut with that comes a very inflationary environment, and Bitcoin\u2019s one of those scarce assets that can\u2019t be inflated arbitrarily. There are a lot of people wanting to take control of their money right now.\u201d\n\nIn a largely cash deal, Independent Reserve has absorbed the Bitcoin.com.au brand and plans to leverage this and its fresh $400,000 sponsorship deal with the Sydney Swans to target retail investors who have long been confused by the crypto exchange\u2019s existing brand."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency has rapidly developed from a niche concept into something relatively mainstream - and it offers unique opportunities for Finance researchers. Dr Igor Makarov of the LSE Department of Finance discusses what inspired his world-leading work on cryptocurrency, the realities of decentralised finance, and what lessons can be taken from traditional finance.\n\n. WATCH: Demystifying Cryptocurrency with Igor Makarov, LSE\n\nWhile the new ecosystem is evolving, different applications are built and the regulatory framework is being developed, research can have a lot of impact\n\nCryptocurrencies have quite rapidly gone from being a niche product to being almost mainstream - these days there are few people who haven't heard about Bitcoin or Ethereum - and we have also seen the emergence of a new Financial architecture that aims to replace and disrupt the current financial system.\n\nThere is much debate about the benefits and risks of this new financial architecture and cryptocurrencies in general. In my research I try to shed light on some of these open questions. While the new ecosystem is evolving, different applications are built and the regulatory framework is being developed, research can have a lot of impact.\n\nthis field essentially faces the same frictions that are found in traditional finance\n\nIn a recent paper I co-authored with Antoinette Schoar we study the Bitcoin market, which is the oldest and still the largest cryptocurrency market. As part of our analysis we built the most complete database of entities that are tied to Bitcoin wallets, and we use this database to study the evolution of Bitcoin markets. We demonstatre that the reality of the Bitcoin ecosystem is very different from its original ideal of decentralization and leveling the playing field for all. Even after more than 10 years in existence the Bitcoin ecosystem is still dominated by large and concentrated players: the top 10000 investors control more than 30 percent of all Bitcoins and circulation; the top 50 miners often control more than 50 percent of all aggregate mining capacity. This inherent concentration makes Bitcoin susceptible to systemic risk, and it also implies that the gains from further Bitcoin adoption will likely disproportionately fall to a small set of people.\n\nIt is interesting to see that this field essentially faces the same frictions that are found in traditional finance. Overcoming these frictions is challenging, and often you do need some regulation - or at least you should not just discard what has been done in the traditional Financial system. The infrastructure or architecture found in the traditional Financial system is not random; in fact it's designed to overcome frictions, make financial markets more efficient, and make them work. In that sense there is a lot that cryptocurrencies can learn from the traditional Financial system\n\nI saw unique opportunites for Finance research\n\nI remember being interested the first time I heard about cryptocurrencies. Because it was a 'Wild West', without regulation, and because it was based on a blockchain technology, I saw unique opportunites for Finance research. Blockchain technology makes data public and records all transactions, so we actually have a chance to look at the behavior of investors and individuals. This type of data can be very difficult to obtain in traditional Finance research.\n\nOf course it's not perfect, because with cryptocurrencies we don't see the real people behind the addresses, but nevertheless we can, in many cases, identify individuals, and by looking at, for example, how tokens move from one address to another, we can deduce how people trade and think about the system, and that allows us to gain a deeper insight into financial markets.\n\nWe have already presented our work to the Bank of England, SEC and the New York Stock Exchange among others, as well as many private companies. The cryptocurrency field evolves extremely fast, and Regulators in particular can find themselves in a situation where it's very difficult to keep up with the space - even I, as a researcher, have to learn something new almost every day because of the pace of innovation - so in my research I try to explain how this world works, to map it and make it understandable, and explain the economic forces at play in a way that people can relate to.\n\nIgor Makarov is Associate Professor of Finance at the London School of Economics and Political Science.\n\nRead more about his work at https://personal.lse.ac.uk/makarov1/"

        "title": "With banks sinking, the future of Bitcoin (BTC), RenQ Finance, and Ethereum (ETH) seems brighter than ever - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As traditional financial institutions face increased scrutiny and declining public trust, many investors are turning to cryptocurrencies as a more reliable and secure store of value.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, RenQ Finance, and Ethereum are becoming more attractive to investors. Their decentralized nature, security, and potential for long-term growth make them a strong choice for those looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin is the world\u2019s first and most well-known cryptocurrency, launched in 2009 by an anonymous individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Its decentralized nature and built-in scarcity have made it a popular choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nAs traditional banks struggle with issues of inflation, Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply and algorithmically-capped maximum supply of 21 million coins make it a strong alternative store of value. Despite recent volatility in the crypto market, Bitcoin has maintained its position as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ)\n\nRenQ Finance is a decentralized finance platform that uses advanced AI technology to offer users secure and efficient financial services. RenQ Finance is built on a blockchain that enables cross-chain interoperability, making it easy for users to transfer assets between different blockchains.\n\nRenQ Finance has gained significant attention in the crypto market, with its successful presale phase raising over $2.7 million and its potential for further growth. RenQ Finance has the potential to revolutionize the DeFi industry with its innovative approach to cross-chain exchange technology, offering a more effective and affordable method of transferring assets between different blockchains.\n\nAdditionally, Investors have gained more trust in RenQ Finance following its successful CertiK security audit. This has been a significant development for the project, as it assures investors that their investments are secure and that the platform is reliable. The audit found no critical vulnerabilities or issues in RenQ Finance\u2019s smart contracts, demonstrating that the project is built on a strong and secure foundation. This has further strengthened the project\u2019s position in the market and attracted more investors looking for a trustworthy DeFi project.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) using smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that run on the Ethereum network, allowing developers to create a wide range of decentralized applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to online marketplaces.\n\nEthereum\u2019s popularity has grown significantly in recent years, and it is now the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Its decentralized nature and strong community support make it a reliable and secure choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nBitcoin Vs Ethereum Vs RenQ Finance: What is the difference\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and RenQ Finance are all cryptocurrencies, but they have different features, use cases, and technologies behind them.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. It was created in 2009 as a decentralized digital currency that could be used to make peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors. Bitcoin\u2019s main use case is as a store of value and a means of exchange. It has a limited supply, with a maximum of 21 million coins that can be mined, and its mining process is based on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a decentralized blockchain platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. It was created in 2015 to create a decentralized platform for building decentralized applications. Ethereum\u2019s main use case is as a platform for building dApps and smart contracts. It uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm and has no fixed supply, but instead uses a dynamic issuance model.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) is a multi-chain, decentralized exchange that allows for direct trading through the user\u2019s wallet app. It is designed to enhance decentralized trading and support DeFi protocols. RenQ Finance\u2019s main use case is as a decentralized exchange and it uses a Layer 2 scaling solution to reduce transaction costs and increase speed. RenQ Finance has a total supply of 1 billion coins.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency market can be volatile, these three cryptocurrencies have shown resilience in the face of market fluctuations and are well-positioned for future growth. As the world becomes more digitally focused and decentralized, the future of Bitcoin, RenQ Finance, and Ethereum looks brighter than ever.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "OpenAI ChatGPT-4 highlights the significance of Bitcoin in today\u2019s world\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) powered ChatGPT from OpenAI has demonstrated its value in giving information on a variety of topics, such as the cryptocurrency industry, while its most recent iteration was capable to identify every justification for the importance of Bitcoin (BTC). ChatGPT-4 explains the need for Bitcoin, interestingly, when ChatGPT-4 was asked by Michael Saylor, the creator, and CEO of the enterprise analytics software MicroStrategy, why the world required Bitcoin, the AI platform responded in-depth with a list of eight reasons\n\nDecentralization, or the fact that no single organization, like a government or financial institution, can control it, provides more freedom, autonomy, and resistance to censorship and manipulation, and is the main justification for the principal digital asset, according to ChatGPT. Second, the AI tool highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s capacity to give unbanked and underbanked people access to financial services, such as in areas with constrained or non-existent traditional banking systems, where only a smartphone and internet connectivity are to use the cryptocurrency.\n\nThird on the list are Bitcoin transaction fees, which, as ChatGPT said, can be lower \u201cthan traditional financial services, especially for cross-border transactions.\u201d It also stressed that this can result in lower costs for both customers and enterprises engaged in international transfers. Furthermore, \u201ctransactions can be easily verified and traced, minimizing the danger of fraud and corruption\u201d because \u201cBitcoin transactions are recorded on a public, tamper-resistant ledger called the blockchain.\u201d\n\nThe chatbot also correctly noted that because there are only 21 million Bitcoins available, it acts as a deflationary currency and lowers the risk of inflation, which over time tends to \u201cundermine the purchasing value of traditional currencies.\u201d The better level of anonymity when transferring assets compared to regular transactions provided by crypto transfers being simply associated with a public address rather than sensitive personal data was the sixth pro-Bitcoin reason cited by GPT-4.\n\nThe value of Bitcoin as an investment and a means of diversifying financial portfolios comes in seventh position, according to the GPT-4, which observed that the largest DeFi asset by market size had shown its potential for significant growth in value over time. By the use of smart contracts, which may automate and expedite a variety of financial procedures and transactions, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies \u201callow programmable money, leading to enhanced efficiency and innovative business models.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "The Benefits and Drawbacks of Using Bitcoin for Online Gambling in 2023 - Punch Newspapers",
        "content": "As cryptocurrencies become more widely adopted and accepted, it has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for online gambling.\n\nAlthough this cryptocurrency has many uses in the online gambling industry, it does come with a few challenges that all businesses must tackle. Despite its rapid growth, Bitcoin remains an early-stage technology, and the market remains highly unpredictable.\n\nNow that blockchain technology has enabled cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to exist as a secure and reliable form of payment; online casinos can offer their customers a safer and more immersive experience when playing popular crypto slot games or betting on sports.\n\nThe Advantages of Using Bitcoin for Online Gambling\n\nCrypto-enabled online casinos provide an immersive and secure experience that traditional casinos cannot replicate. Although not the best crypto-currency for all types of gaming, Bitcoin does come with a few notable advantages:\n\nTransaction Speed\n\nOne of the main benefits of using Bitcoin for online gambling is its fast transaction speed. Traditional payment solutions can take days to process. However, it only takes a matter of minutes to complete Bitcoin transactions.\n\nRather than having to wait to receive winnings or worry about complicated currency conversions, Bitcoin transactions can be received almost instantly. This allows players to gain access to their funds right away.\n\nAnonymous Entries\n\nBitcoin payment information doesn\u2019t require customers to hand over their personal details to gaming platforms. As a result, players can stay completely anonymous on the web while still enjoying all of the perks associated with online casinos.\n\nAt the same time, customers don\u2019t have to worry about identity theft, as they don\u2019t have to submit any personal data in the first place.\n\nNo Refunds\n\nThe best thing about Bitcoin transactions is that the funds are immutable, meaning customers can\u2019t charge the merchants back. Transactions cannot undergo any altering on the public ledger. This provides security to both the merchant and the client.\n\nWholly Private\n\nCustomers can easily find their personal balances stated on the public ledger. However, no one else will know who purchased what from the gaming platform.\n\nLow Fees\n\nBitcoin transactions don\u2019t require human merchants or physical institutions to act as middlemen.\n\nAs a result, the transaction fees are always kept low. However, clients still have to pay some fees if they want to speed up the transaction process, but this is optional and not absolute for all online casinos.\n\nNot Always Taxed\n\nCustomers should always check in with the tax regulations stated by their government before betting with cryptocurrencies. Not all countries impose tax regulations on Bitcoin winnings and profits, but some nations still do.\n\nDecentralized\n\nNo one can \u201cfreeze\u201d your account and take your winnings. Bitcoin transactions are completely decentralized and public, meaning only you own your profits. Third-party institutions can never interfere with your withdrawals. In addition, here\u2019s a few hacks for slot game players on how to increase their game profits.\n\nUnlike other traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not regulated or controlled by any one organization or government.\n\nThis provides a secure, private layer of transactions to gamble with, making it a desirable means of payment for many users who are wary of government oversight and regulations.\n\nThe Disadvantages of Using Bitcoin for Online Gambling\n\nBitcoin is still considered the go-to payment option when it comes to online gambling for many, but there are a few drawbacks to using this cryptocurrency.\n\nVolatile\n\nUnlike other stable coins, Bitcoin is highly volatile and is occasionally subjected to market fluctuations. Due to its value being so sensitive, it can be difficult to make predictions about whether a transaction will be profitable or not.\n\nFurthermore, if Bitcoin were to suddenly collapse, it would leave gamers with little to no recourse for recovering their funds.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technology are constantly undergoing changes and have experienced quite a few highs and lows. This has led to the currency\u2019s collapse in the past, along with the extra fees some countries levy on crypto transactions.\n\nUntraceable\n\nOn the flip side, Bitcoin\u2019s untraceable nature can also be problematic. Players don\u2019t have the same security as traditional payment solutions. As a result, there is always a risk of fraud and malicious software targeting Bitcoin gambling networks.\n\nHowever, by offering multiple crypto and digital solutions, online casinos can increase their customer base and keep up with the latest trends. It is important for each casino to understand and exploit the latest features available when integrating various cryptocurrencies for a secure gambling environment.\n\nBitcoin Payments and Transactions in a Nutshell\n\nLarge corporations and online casinos around the world are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as the go-to payment option.\n\nHowever, while the advantages of Bitcoin are numerous \u2013 including its decentralized, secure, private, and fast nature \u2013 there is also an undeniable downside to using this digital currency for online gambling.\n\nBeing a decentralized currency, Bitcoin is not subjected to the same regulations or taxes as other traditional currencies, making it attractive to businesses and players alike.\n\nUnfortunately, this lack of regulation also means that the value of Bitcoin can be highly volatile and that it might collapse in the blink of an eye.\n\nSince the currency does not have any physical form, users have no way of returning any assets. This means that those using Bitcoin for gambling could easily lose money if the currency depreciates.\n\nThe technology behind Bitcoin is still undergoing many changes. With new developments happening every day, it could be challenging for businesses and users to keep up with all the new features in the blockchain. This could eventually lead to a number of errors.\n\nFinal Words\n\nIn summary, while Bitcoin does have its advantages for online gambling, its decentralized system and market volatility also pose a risk for those financially involved with it.\n\nWhile Bitcoin does provide a secure, immersive, and fast way to conduct transactions, players and online casinos must stay aware of the ever-changing cryptocurrency environment and its potential pitfalls.\n\nIt is important to consider both the potential risks and rewards before undergoing any type of cryptocurrency gambling.\n\nHowever, as blockchain technology continues to progress and improve, crypto-based payments will likely become more popular in the world of online gambling and also a go-to option for most players and businesses."

Dank der dwpbank k\u00f6nnen bald 1.200 deutsche Banken und Sparkassen BTC und Co. anbieten.\n\nKrypto in Deutschland: Diese Banken bieten bald Bitcoin an\n\nKrypto in Deutschland: Diese Banken bieten bald Bitcoin an\n\nMit rund 1.200 deutschen Banken ist die Deutsche WertpapierService Bank AG (dwpbank) das f\u00fchrende Institut f\u00fcr Wertpapierdienstleistungen. Banken und Sparkassen greifen auf die Infrastruktur des Dienstleisters zur\u00fcck, um ihren Kunden Wertpapiere-Services anbieten zu k\u00f6nnen. In einer Pressekonferenz, die das Unternehmen am heutigen 23. M\u00e4rz abhielt, gab die dwpbank einen wichtigen Durchbruch bekannt: Mit ihrer neuen Plattform wpNex erm\u00f6glicht sie allen angeschlossenen Banken die M\u00f6glichkeit, ihren Kunden Bitcoin und perspektivisch diverse andere digitale Assets anzubieten.\n\nBitcoin bei der MLP Banking AG\n\nDen Start des Krypto-Angebotes macht die MLP Banking AG. So hei\u00dft es von Dr. Paul Utzat, dem Bereichsleiter Konto und Wertpapierabwicklung:\n\n\u201cIn Zusammenarbeit mit der dwpbank m\u00f6chten wir unseren Kunden zuk\u00fcnftig den Handel von Kryptow\u00e4hrungen anbieten. In unserem MLP-Kundenportal ist es eine logische Erg\u00e4nzung zum vorhandenen Angebot im Verm\u00f6gensmanagement.\u201d\n\nAuf Nachfrage gab Utzat bekannt, dass dieser Service f\u00fcr alle Retailkunden in der zweiten Jahresh\u00e4lfte geplant ist.\n\nKryptow\u00e4hrungen in gewohnter Umgebung\n\nMit der wpNEX-Plattform der dwpbank kann der Krypto-Handel gewohnt in das Online-Banking des Kunden integriert werden. Bank- und Sparkassenkunden sehen so neben ihrem Wertpapierdepot ein Kryptokonto, auf dem ihre Kryptow\u00e4hrungen verwahrt sind. Genauso wie beim Wertpapierdepot kann auch das Girokonto bei der Hausbank zur Verrechnung genutzt werden, sodass kein Pre-Funding notwendig ist. Auch eine zus\u00e4tzliche Verifizierung m\u00fcssen die Bankkunden bei ihrer Kryptokonto-Er\u00f6ffnung entsprechend nicht mehr durchlaufen.\n\nF\u00fcr die maximale Sicherheit sorgt der BaFin-regulierte Custody-Service Tangany (Verwahrung der Private Keys) und um die Ausf\u00fchrung der B\u00f6rsenorders sowie die Preisstellung k\u00fcmmert sich Bankhaus Scheich / tradias. Zus\u00e4tzlich unterst\u00fctzt der Software-Dienstleister Valantic.\n\nBitcoin bald bei allen Volksbanken?\n\nDie gro\u00dfe Frage lautet nat\u00fcrlich, wann die anderen Banken der MLP Banking AG folgen werden. So wurde auf der Pressekonferenz in Aussicht gestellt, dass die DZ Bank zum Jahreswechsel ein Bitcoin-Angebot f\u00fcr ihre Kunden plant \u2013 ein Paukenschlag f\u00fcr die Bitcoin-Etablierung in Deutschland. Schlie\u00dflich ist die DZ Bank das Zentralinstitut f\u00fcr alle rund 800 Volksbanken in Deutschland.\n\nAuf die Frage, wie es bei den Sparkassen aussieht, gab man sich bedeckter. Hier scheint es innerhalb der Sparkassenfinanzgruppe noch immer keine klare Linie zu geben. In dem Jahr 2023 ist jedenfalls nicht mehr damit zu rechnen.\n\ndwpbank legt die Weichen\n\nMit ihrer wpNex-Plattform legt die dwpbank die entscheidenden Weichen f\u00fcr den Krypto-Standort Deutschland. Mit dem neu geschaffenen Angebot erh\u00f6ht man den Druck auf Banken und Sparkassen, die Kundennachfrage nach Bitcoin und Co. zu bedienen.\n\nBitcoin ist dabei nur der Anfang, wie der Vorstandvorsitzende der dwpbank, Dr. Heiko Beck, betont. Zuk\u00fcnftig sollen diverse digitale Assets, neben Kryptow\u00e4hrungen also auch digitale Wertpapiere und sonstige tokenisierte Assets, hinzukommen."

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market continues to brave through the financial crisis that has already crushed several major banking institutions, Bitcoin (BTC) has recorded better results than nearly 100% of the 500 leading publicly traded companies in the United States during the third month of 2023.\n\nIndeed, since March 10, the price of Bitcoin has increased by 37.06% and over 72% since the year\u2019s turn, while the flagship cryptocurrency registered better year-to-date (YTD) returns than 488 or 97.6% of S&P 500 companies, including FedEx (NYSE: FDX), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), according to the data shared with Finbold by the crypto education platform CryptoManiaks on March 22.\n\nBy comparison, only 12 companies among the S&P 500 have managed to cross the threshold of 35% in YTD returns, which means that Bitcoin has outperformed the 27.2% YTD returns of FedEx, the 19.3% YTD returns achieved by Apple, and the 17.8% recorded by Amazon, as the table demonstrates.\n\nBitcoin vs. publicly traded companies. Source: CryptoManiaks\n\nBitcoin\u2019s other successes\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the flagship crypto has outperformed commodities in 2023, particularly gold, \u201cthe top-performing old-guard commodity,\u201d almost 10-fold, indicating it might be in a \u2018super cycle,\u2019 according to Bloomberg\u2019s commodity specialist Mike McGlone.\n\nElsewhere, Bitcoin is writing down successes in other areas, as more than 70% of its holders are currently in profit, and most of them have held on to the maiden decentralized finance (DeFi) asset for one year or longer, as Finbold earlier reported.\n\nOn top of that, investors who started dollar-cost averaging (DCA) Bitcoin at its peak price of $69,000 in November 2021 are currently recording 10% returns on their regular investment, despite the price of Bitcoin being significantly lower than its all-time high (ATH).\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs things stand, the price of Bitcoin currently stands at $28,587, which represents an increase of 2.20% in the last 24 hours, in addition to the accumulated gains of 16.38% across the previous seven days and 18.89% on its monthly chart, as the latest CoinMarketCap data indicates.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart.

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market continues to demonstrate strength amid the widespread financial crisis that has already toppled several banking giants, Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed the key $28,000 price level, in turn outperforming commodities in recent months.\n\nIndeed, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg, Mike McGlone, shared his analysis of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset\u2019s performance in 2023, which suggests that Bitcoin has outperformed gold, \u201cthe top-performing old-guard commodity,\u201d almost 10-fold, as he explained on March 21.\n\n\u2018Super cycle\u2019 in progress?\n\nAccording to McGlone, such a strong performance of the maiden cryptocurrency compared to commodities \u201cmay be indicative of a super cycle happening in the crypto,\u201d made possible by \u201cBitcoin\u2019s nascent stage of low and rising adoption vs. diminishing supply.\u201d\n\nElongated upward trajectory of Bitcoin vs. commodities. Source: Mike McGlone\n\nAs the strategist highlighted, the above graphic was \u201ctypical compared with most assets,\u201d but what is \u201cunique relative to commodities is the 260-day volatility of Bitcoin bottoming from a new low.\u201d According to him, \u201cif past trends hold, the crypto\u2019s volatility is more likely to recover vs. commodities when Bitcoin heads toward new highs.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, the commodities expert noted that the current crisis in traditional finance could be helping Bitcoin and stablecoins to come out as a suitable alternative thanks to their advantages as opposed to banks:\n\n\u201cThe banking crisis and issues with fractional reserves may be shining a light on the attributes of Bitcoin and crypto dollars fully backed by [Treasury bills (T-bills)].\u201d\n\nBitcoin price advances\n\nMeanwhile, things are looking good for the largest digital asset by market capitalization as, at press time, it was changing hands at the price of $28,148, which represents an increase of 1.67% on the day, 13.21% across the past week, as well as 17.38% over the previous 30 days, as charts indicate.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin has added over $200 billion to its market cap in 2023 alone, while five leading banks in the United States lost an aggregated $108.92 billion during the same period, whereas the crypto \u2018Fear & Greed\u2019 index hit a 16-month high, indicating high purchase interest, as Finbold reported on March 21.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
