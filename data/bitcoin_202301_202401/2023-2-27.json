        "content": "Parent company of the popular Bored Apes NFTs, Yuga Labs, has announced an experimental 300-piece generative art collection called TwelveFold, housed on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nTwelveFold is a mathematically-based art system that utilizes a 12\u00d712 grid to represent data and comes amid the company\u2019s debut launch on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe collection will be inscribed onto satoshis and will feature 3D and hand-drawn elements that pay tribute to the current practice of creating ordinal inscriptions by hand, according to a company blog post on Monday.\n\nThe use of a base 12 system explores the relationship between time, mathematics, and variability in what Yuga Labs describes as \u201ca visual allegory for the cartography of data.\u201d\n\nEach satoshi within the collection can be located by tracking when it was minted via the Ordinal Theory protocol \u2014 which continues to gain attention following its release to the Bitcoin mainnet last month.\n\nYuga Labs said its decision to pursue both the type of collection as well as its release on Bitcoin marked a departure from what\u2019s expected from the company.\n\n\u201cBut, you know. F**k doing expected things,\u201d the company wrote in its post. \u201cStepping into the Ordinals Discord a month ago felt like getting a glimpse of the 2017-era Ethereum NFT ecosystem.\u201d\n\nIt comes as a team from Dubai launched 10,000 BTC BAYC NFTs featuring monkeys with Satoshi masks on Ordinals, earlier this month. The move raises potential copyright issues as they are not affiliated with Yuga Labs\u2019 assets based on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhile the infrastructure and tooling around inscriptions on Bitcoin are still nascent, the foundational principles of provenance, self-custody and ownership are present, Yuga Labs said.\n\nThe company expects the technology and ecosystem around inscriptions to evolve and become more sophisticated over time leading to further experimentation and releases down the road.\n\nFurther details about timing and auction mechanics are expected to be announced in the coming weeks, Yuga Labs said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin and ether are on pace for a modest February win, even after suffering a big drop earlier in the month.\n\nBitcoin had eked out a 0.2% gain for the month by 4:15 p.m. ET, according to Coin Metrics. In January bitcoin posted a 38% rise and its best month since 2021. Meanwhile, ether had risen higher by 1.7%, following a January gain of 31%. Unlike traditional markets, the crypto market remains open 24 hours a day, even on weekends and public holidays.\n\nInvestors were spooked earlier in the month after what appeared to be the beginning of a potential regulatory crackdown on crypto businesses in the U.S. \u2014 including the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement action against Kraken, its Wells Notice of a future settlement against Paxos and the New York State Department of Financial Services' ordering Paxos to stop minting the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin.\n\nThat led to a brief sell-off in crypto assets that took bitcoin and ether down about 6% and 8.5%, respectively, in the three-day period ended Feb. 10. Although they quickly recovered those losses the following week, they've been in a bit of a lull since.\n\n\"It's pretty easy to say that the lows are behind us because there really isn't any disparate further selling, but in terms of what actually takes us higher \u2013 that's harder,\" said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca.\n\n\"Most of the negative news right now is coming out of regulators, but it's just not really having any long-term effect on the market because everything in crypto has perfect substitutes,\" he added, meaning when certain crypto companies in the past have been hit by regulators, traders have always been able to move their activity somewhere else.\n\nWhile regulatory scrutiny is ramping in the U.S., reports that Hong Kong is planning to legalize retail crypto trading as part of a bigger push to become a global crypto hub surfaced this month, with a quiet backing from China. The move has been a positive catalyst for crypto.\n\nIn the U.S., however, investors are on Fed watch, said James Lavish, managing partner at the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund.\n\n\"Bitcoin has been the tip of the spear for risk assets for a long time,\" he said. \"It's what moves first typically when you're talking about either buying or selling risk assets as part of your portfolio allocation and when we do in fact have a Fed pivot I expect that bitcoin is going to sniff that out first. It's going to have a strong move.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin bulls remain in charge even in the face of increasing regulatory FUD - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price broke above $25,000 on Feb. 21, accruing a 53% year-to-date gain. At the time, it made sense to expect the rally to continue after U.S. retail sales data from the previous week vastly surpassed the market consensus. This fuelled investors\u2019 hope for a soft landing and a possible averted recession in the U.S. economy.\n\nThe apex of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s strategy success would be increasing interest rates and scaling back its $9 trillion balance sheet reduction without significatively damaging the economy. If that miracle happens, the outcome would benefit risk assets, including stocks, commodities and Bitcoin.\n\nUnfortunately, the cryptocurrency markets took a hit after the $25,200 level was rejected and Bitcoin price plunged 10% between Feb. 21 and Feb. 24. Regulatory pressure, mainly from the U.S., partially explains investors' rationale for the worsening market conditions.\n\nIn a Feb. 23 New York Magazine interview, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler claimed \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d is potentially a security instrument and falls under the agency\u2019s jurisdiction. However, multiple lawyers and policy analysts commented that Gensler\u2019s opinion is \u201cnot the law.\u201d Hence, the SEC had no authority to regulate cryptocurrencies unless it proved its case in court.\n\nAdditionally, at a G20 meeting, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stressed the importance of implementing a strong regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Yellen\u2019s remarks on Feb. 25 followed International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva pointing out that \u201cif regulation fails,\u201d then outright banning \u201cshould not be \u201ctaken off the table.\u201d\n\nLet's look at Bitcoin derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nAsia-based stablecoin demand is stagnant\n\nTraders should refer to the USD Coin (USDC) premium to measure the demand for cryptocurrency in Asia. The index measures the difference between China-based peer-to-peer stablecoin trades and the United States dollar.\n\nExcessive cryptocurrency buying demand can pressure the indicator above fair value at 104%. On the other hand, the stablecoin's market offer is flooded during bearish markets, causing a 4% or higher discount.\n\nUSDC peer-to-peer vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKX\n\nAfter peaking at 4% in late January, the USDC premium indicator in Asian markets has declined to a neutral 2%. The metric has since stabilized at a modest 2.5% premium, which should be interpreted as positive considering the recent regulatory FUD.\n\nBTC\u2019s futures premium stuck even after price rejected at $25,000\n\nBitcoin\u2019s quarterly futures are the preferred instruments of whales and arbitrage desks. Due to their settlement date and the price difference from spot markets, they might seem complicated for retail traders. However, their most notable advantage is the lack of a fluctuating funding rate.\n\nThese fixed-month contracts usually trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are requesting more money to withhold settlement longer. Consequently, futures markets should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium on healthy markets. This situation is known as contango and is not exclusive to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe chart shows traders flirting with the neutral sentiment between Feb. 19 and Feb. 24 as the Bitcoin price held above $23,750. However, the indicator failed to enter the neutral-to-bearish 0% to 5% area as additional regulatory uncertainty was added, especially after Gensler\u2019s remarks on Feb. 23. As a result, it became clear that pro traders were not comfortable with Bitcoin price breaking above $25,000.\n\nRelated: Is the SEC\u2019s action against BUSD more about Binance than stablecoins?\n\nWeak economic data shifted control to the bulls\n\nSince Feb. 25, Bitcoin price has gained 4.5%, indicating that the impact of the regulatory newsflow has been limited. More importantly, the global stock market reacted positively on Feb. 27 after the U.S. Commerce Department reported durable goods orders down 4.5% in January versus the previous month. This data added pressure for the Fed to reduce its interest rate hike program earlier than expected.\n\nSince Bitcoin's 50-day correlation with the S&P 500 futures presently stands at 83%, cryptocurrency traders are more inclined to support risk asset prices strengthening throughout the week. A correlation indicator above 70% indicates that both assets are moving in tandem, meaning the macroeconomic scenario is likely playing a pivotal role in determining the overall trend.\n\nUnless there\u2019s added pressure from regulators or conflicting economic data, odds favor Bitcoin bulls considering the BTC futures and Asian stablecoin metrics.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "SEC chair Gensler confirms \"everything other than Bitcoin\" is a security: Implications and analysis - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The following is a guest post from Anndy Lian.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler reiterated that Bitcoin is not a security but a commodity under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) purview. He also stated that \u201ceverything else other than bitcoin is a security,\u201d which has significant implications for regulating cryptocurrencies and digital assets in the United States.\n\nGensler\u2019s statement reflects the SEC\u2019s long-held view that many cryptocurrencies and digital assets are securities under U.S. law. The SEC\u2019s definition of a security is broad \u2014 it includes any investment contract in which an individual invests money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits solely from the efforts of others. In other words, if an asset is sold as an investment with the expectation of profit based on the efforts of others, it is likely to be considered a security.\n\nGensler\u2019s comments have sparked debate in the cryptocurrency community. Some argue that his view is overly broad and that many digital assets do not fit the SEC\u2019s definition of a security. Others argue that the SEC\u2019s approach is necessary to protect investors from fraudulent or manipulative activities in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nOne of the key implications of Gensler\u2019s comments is that many digital assets may be subject to SEC regulation. This could include initial coin offerings (ICOs), a crowdfunding campaign where investors purchase digital tokens in exchange for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Many ICOs have been criticized for their lack of transparency and accountability, and the SEC has taken enforcement action against several ICO issuers in recent years.\n\nAnother implication is that exchanges that trade digital assets may be subject to SEC oversight. Under U.S. law, exchanges facilitating securities trading must register with the SEC and comply with various regulations. If the SEC views many digital assets as securities, then exchanges that trade those assets may also be required to register with the SEC and comply with its regulations.\n\nHis comments suggest that the SEC may take a more aggressive approach to regulating the cryptocurrency market. This could include increased enforcement actions against issuers of digital assets considered securities and against exchanges that facilitate trading those assets. It could also lead to new regulations to increase transparency and accountability in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approach to regulating cryptocurrency has been debated for several years. Some argue that the SEC\u2019s current approach is too cautious and stifling innovation in the cryptocurrency space. Others argue that increased regulation is necessary to protect investors from fraud and manipulation.\n\nGensler\u2019s comments suggest that the SEC will likely take a more assertive approach to regulate the cryptocurrency market in the coming years. This could include increased enforcement actions, new regulations, and closer scrutiny of digital assets and exchanges that operates in the U.S.\n\nMaybe we can take a step back to look into a few things. Firstly, it\u2019s important to understand the context of Gensler\u2019s statement. As mentioned earlier, Gensler reiterated the SEC\u2019s stance in an interview with CNBC in July 2022 that Bitcoin is not a security but a commodity that falls under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. He did not label other digital assets, avoiding answering the question directly. However, in a tweet by Jake Chervinsky in February 2023, it was suggested that Gensler may have prejudged that every digital asset aside from Bitcoin is a security.\n\nThen my question is: What exactly is a security? In the US, the Securities Act of 1933 defines a security as any investment contract, note, stock, or any other type of investment in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits solely from the efforts of others. In simpler terms, it means an asset representing an ownership interest or a right to receive future profits or cash flows from a third party.\n\nSuppose we consider Gensler\u2019s statement that everything other than Bitcoin is a security. In that case, it implies that most digital assets such as Ethereum, XRP, and other cryptocurrencies would be considered securities under US law. This means that they would be subject to SEC regulations and oversight. It\u2019s worth noting that this is not a new position for the SEC. For years, the SEC has warned cryptocurrency companies that their tokens could be classified as securities if they meet certain criteria.\n\nThe implications of this classification are significant. If a digital asset is classified as a security, the issuer must comply with SEC regulations, including registration and disclosure requirements. It would also have to follow strict trading, reporting, and investor protection rules. Additionally, investors would be protected under federal securities laws, which could increase their confidence in the digital asset market. However, it could also lead to additional costs and regulatory burdens for the companies issuing digital assets.\n\nMy opinion on this matter is that while Gensler\u2019s statement may have been perceived as a blanket statement, the SEC\u2019s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies is nuanced and fact-specific. The SEC has been clear that it will evaluate each token on a case-by-case basis to determine whether it meets the legal definition of a security. In other words, just because a digital asset is not Bitcoin does not automatically mean it\u2019s a security.\n\nFurthermore, regulatory oversight is necessary for the cryptocurrency market to mature and gain mainstream adoption. The lack of clear regulations has been a major roadblock for institutional investors, who are hesitant to invest in a market perceived as unregulated and risky. Clear regulations would also protect retail investors who may not have the knowledge or resources to navigate the complex world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo conclude, while Gensler\u2019s statement that \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d is a security may have caused some alarm in the cryptocurrency community, we believe that it\u2019s important to view it in the context of the SEC\u2019s broader approach to regulating digital assets. The SEC\u2019s focus on investor protection and market integrity is crucial for the long-term success of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAs the market continues to evolve, we expect that the SEC\u2019s approach will continue to evolve, and we look forward to seeing how it develops. Meanwhile, I hope SEC can be more precise and take a more responsible stance when putting statements out in the market.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Bitcoin Ordinals: What Investors Should Know - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nA new project has appeared on the crypto scene, creating a new use case for Bitcoin; a system for tracking individual satoshis on the Bitcoin blockchain, effectively enabling Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nThis project, led by a former Bitcoin Core developer Casey Rodarmor, is essentially a protocol for assigning numbers to specific satoshis that can allow them to be tracked and specifically transferred. Representing one hundred-millionth of a single bitcoin, the satoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin that can be used in transactions. By using the Ordinal protocol, users can assign content to a satoshi that they please, essentially opening the door for NFTs to run directly on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nNFTs (non-fungible tokens) can be a contentious issue, not only in the greater world of traditional finance but also among crypto advocates and Bitcoiners in general. The launch of this program immediately saw pushback from within the Bitcoin community, with people claiming that such an asset has little to do with Bitcoin adoption or daily usage for most people, and might even take up valuable resources. Still, there has been significant interest in Ordinals, as more than 90,000 inscriptions have been minted over the course of about a month.\n\nFor many, the purpose of an NFT is to create a speculative financial instrument, allowing users to provide a specific tracker for a piece of code, typically a piece of artwork, that cannot be replicated even if the art itself is copied. The first generation of NFTs, largely based on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, bubbled to widespread popularity in 2022 before popping spectacularly in the year\u2019s subsequent crypto crash. If NFTs are to slowly return, finding use cases in things like online stores for video games or social media, it seems reasonable to believe that a Bitcoin infrastructure will provide many distinct advantages over an Ethereum one. Because each Ordinal inscription is tied to a satoshi, this will make their verification system \u201con-chain\u201d at a fundamental level, instead of previous attempts that have a third-party workaround to merely align with an existing blockchain.\n\nAlthough there is certainly skepticism about the viability of Ordinals in the long term, the buzz of excitement from its nascent community can definitely be seen as a positive for Bitcoin. As Fortune pointed out, bitcoin\u2019s price bounce in early 2023 is largely correlating with the emergence of Ordinal. It quotes Jon Wong from the Solana Foundation as saying, \u201cAs Ordinal mints have increased, the minters have been willing to pay the miners, the computers that run and secure Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, more and more in transaction fees.\u201d In other words, then, the increased frenzy could be one of the reasons behind bitcoin\u2019s recent price increase.\n\nAlthough the long-term staying power of Ordinals is unclear at the moment, it can\u2019t be denied that ideas like this are a prime example of the endless iterations and innovations made by a strong Bitcoin community. The emergence of new ideas and technologies like Ordinals have provided many of the great use-cases of Bitcoin over the years, and both successful and failed projects can stimulate interest and activity in Bitcoin itself. Potential investors will have to choose carefully before deciding to put money into this new project, but for those who already have exposure to NFTs, it seems a no-brainer to bet on Bitcoin.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining, the computationally intensive process by which new coins are created and accounted for, has become a global concern. After China cracked down on the process in mid-2021, miners sought out other areas of the world where energy was cheap, but not always clean. In places like Kazakhstan, miners put pressure on the power grid, which relies heavily on carbon-intensive coal-fired power stations, causing localized blackouts and contributing to civil unrest. In upstate New York, where miners took over shuttered factories and empty warehouses, locals have complained of rising energy bills and the high-frequency whine of whirring data center fans\u2014and worried about the environmental toll mining is taking. The US currently hosts 38% of all bitcoin mining operations.\n\nA single Bitcoin transaction uses the same amount of energy as a single US household does over the course of nearly a month. But does it have to be that way? The Bitcoin community has historically been fiercely resistant to change, but pressure from regulators and environmentalists fed up with Bitcoin\u2019s massive carbon footprint may force them to rethink that stance.\n\nA variety of other countries, including Kazakhstan, Iran, and Singapore, have also set limits on crypto mining. In April 2023, the European Parliament is due to pass a landmark crypto bill called Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), which mandates environmental disclosures from crypto firms. The law is expected to go into force sometime in 2024.\n\nThat may be just the start for the EU: the European Central Bank has previously stated it cannot imagine a world where governments would ban gasoline-powered cars in favor of electric vehicles but not act on Bitcoin\u2019s persistence in pumping out CO2. \u201cSome members of the European Parliament are already wondering why Bitcoin is not following Ethereum,\u201d Alex de Vries, the data scientist behind Digiconomist, a website that tracks cryptocurrency energy use, told MIT Technology Review.\n\nEfforts to crack down on Bitcoin\u2019s waste are gaining steam in the US as well. In November, New York became the first state to enact a temporary ban on new cryptocurrency mining permits at fossil-fuel plants. The new law also requires New York to study crypto mining\u2019s impact on the state\u2019s efforts to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nSo what would it take to make a switch?\n\nProof of work vs. proof of stake\n\nCryptocurrencies have no central guardian, like a bank, to oversee their public ledgers\u2014the shared digital record of every transaction on the blockchain. Instead, they rely on consensus mechanisms to agree on updates. In proof of work, the approach Bitcoin relies on, a worldwide network of computers\u2014known as \u201cminers\u201d\u2014spends electricity trying to win a lottery of sorts. Whoever wins gets to append the next block and collect new coins in the process. The chance of winning is in direct proportion to the number of computations a miner does. As a result, massive server farms have sprung up around the globe dedicated solely to winning this lottery.\n\nProof of stake, the approach Ethereum now uses, does away with this massive energy consumption. Instead of miners, proof-of-stake systems employ vast numbers of \u201cvalidators.\u201d To become a validator, you have to deposit, or \u201cstake,\u201d a set amount in coins\u201432 ether, in the case of Ethereum. Staking gives validators a chance to check new blocks of transactions and add them to the blockchain so they can earn rewards on top of their staked coins. The more coins you stake, the better your odds of getting picked to add the next block of transactions to the chain."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The article has been updated to reflect that Bitcoin Depot converted the operating software of the Bitcoin ATMs.\n\nCrypto ATM installations have seen a steady decline across the world over the past several months. While some ATMs have been taken out of operation due to geopolitical tensions and revenue decline, providers like Bitcoin Depot have started converting the operating software of physical Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs to improve bottom lines.\n\nBitcoin Depot recently converted the operating software of all 7,000 crypto ATMs and kiosks to a software-based offering powered by BitAccess. The software conversion drive came after Bitcoin Depot acquired majority equity in Bitaccess in November 2022. Months before the deal, Bitcoin Depot had revealed plans to go public in 2023 via an $885 million deal with a special-purpose acquisition company.\n\nThe software conversion of the crypto ATMs, which vertically integrates Bitcoin Depot\u2019s hardware and software, eliminates annual software licensing fees. The fees previously accounted for $3 million in annual operational costs.\n\nCrypto ATM growth by manufacturers. Source: Coin ATM Radar\n\nIn the first half of 2022, BitAccess became a market leader. However, since July 2022, the company has seen a consistent decline in total ATM installations, confirms data from Coin ATM Radar.\n\nAs shown in the above graph, BitAccess is currently down to third position after Genesis Bytes and Genesis Coin, both of whom have increased their market share in the same timeline. Explaining the motive behind the move, Bitcoin Depot\u2019s vice president of BTM operations, Jason Sacco, stated:\n\n\u201cBy swapping out the existing hard drive with one preloaded with BitAccess software, we quickly completed the software conversion while avoiding certain technical issues that can happen in field conversion projects.\u201d\n\nSacco also revealed that the first 6,000 of Bitcoin Depot\u2019s Bitcoin ATMs were software converted in 10 weeks. The increase in crypto ATMs is directly proportional to the amount of crypto exposure for the general public.\n\nWhen El Salvador opted for Bitcoin as a legal tender, President Nayib Bukele announced the country would build a supporting infrastructure of 200 ATMs and 50 branches.\n\nRelated: Australia overtakes El Salvador to become 4th largest crypto ATM hub\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), recently announced that all crypto ATMs operating in the U.K. are unregistered and illegal.\n\nAt the time, FCA\u2019s executive director of enforcement Mark Steward shared the intention to disrupt unregistered crypto businesses in the country."

        "title": "Stacks (STX) surges as Bitcoin NFT hype grows, but its blockchain activity raises concern - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Stacks is one of the first blockchains to enable a way for minting Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals, which puts it in an excellent position to benefit from the hype. However, Ordinals have invoked an issue from the past where Bitcoin maximalist ideologies will be tested if the NFTs lead to network congestion.\n\nOn top of that, Stacks has yet to deliver all the functionalities required to support an NFT trading ecosystem and it faces competition from projects in other blockchain ecosystems. The fundamental and technical analysis of the project suggests that the price surge might have reached overbought conditions and may correct in the near term.\n\nOrdinals development is unpredictable for now\n\nThe recent focus on inscribing NFTs on the Bitcoin network peaked in the last month after Casey Rodarmor inscribed an Ordinal on Jan. 29. While the trend took off to an overwhelming start, the minting is limited to technical users with a Bitcoin node and trading primarily takes place through OTC channels.\n\nIn comparison to Ethereum NFT marketplaces, the infrastructure for Bitcoin NFT trading remains significantly underdeveloped in regards to complex activities like decentralized trading. Many investors have expressed their belief that there needs to be a way to spin up marketplaces and NFT minting platforms for Ordinals.\n\nThe Bitcoin developer community has previously discouraged using the network for anything other than payments because it clogs the space and increases transaction fees. In the bull run of 2020 and 2021, many Ethereum users paid hundreds of dollars in fees per transaction as user activity on it exploded. On the other hand, Bitcoin\u2019s fees stayed at optimum levels throughout the bull run, but the usage and earnings of the protocol lagged behind Ethereum.\n\nAccording to a CoinShare report, the adoption of Ordinals will again be subject to the social acceptance of the method to inscribe additional data on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is bound to present challenges such as network congestion and increased fees.\n\nThe report goes on to review previous failed attempts to use the Bitcoin blockchain for smart contract activity, saying that \u201csimilar projects of Bitcoin\u2019s past have had little impact on investors and users alike.\u201d\n\nThe number of Ordinals inscribed on Bitcoin surged significantly at the start of February as the instrument exploded. However, the trend slowed down due to a lack of trading infrastructure, with less than 10,000 NFTs inscribed on most days.\n\nStack blockchain\u2019s native STX (STX) token jumped by 256% in February, thanks to hype around Bitcoin NFTs and an upcoming upgrade to the project.\n\nNumber of ordinals inscribed on Bitcoin daily. Source: Dune\n\nIt remains to be seen how the Bitcoin community reacts to an increase in network congestion and Bitcoin fees if the Ordinals hype grows.\n\nStacks price rises on speculation, while activity is low\n\nThe idea is that Stacks will make Bitcoin Ordinals more accessible to users by facilitating minting processes and hosting marketplaces.\n\nStacks Foundation, the team managing the blockchain, on Feb. 22 announced a new upgrade to the protocol, Stacks 2.1, which seeks to improve the blockchain by adding EVM compatibility and synthetic Bitcoin (sBTC) through a secure bridge to Bitcoin.\n\nOn top of that, the .BTC naming service lives on the Stacks network, which could generate a lot of trading activity if the demand for .BTC addresses increases. In its current state, a .BTC Stacks address is largely detached from the Bitcoin network. Meaning, users cannot send and receive Bitcoin at these addresses like its .ETH counterpart.\n\nAfter the 2.0 upgrade, Stacks will enable direct sending of Stacks assets to Bitcoin addresses. It will enable proxy access to the Bitcoin blockchain without creating a separate Stacks address. It remains to be seen if Bitcoin users find the feature attractive.\n\nWhile the upgrades sound promising, there\u2019s still insufficient blockchain activity to justify the STX price surge. Only around 1,000 unique active wallets engaged with DApps on Stacks in February. The most striking part of Stack\u2019s usage data was that the NFT marketplace Gamma also failed to attract considerable users to its platform, with less than 100 wallets trading daily on the marketplace.\n\nTop used dApps on Stacks between Jan. 28 and Feb. 27. Source: DappRadar\n\nGamma supports minting and sending Bitcoin ordinal NFTs via Stacks. However, many users have faced UX-related problems while using the feature, as it requires a separate address in a Stacks wallet that is Ordinal compatible. Many users have mistakenly sent their NFTs to wrong addresses. The wallet issue has also restricted the trading of Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nGamma NFT marketplace stats. Source: DappRadar\n\nDevelopers in the Stacks ecosystem, like the Xverse team, are working on a wallet to bring user-friendly Ordinals support. There's also an experiment with atomic swaps between Bitcoin NFTs and STX in the works. The aim is to develop this functionality into a complete marketplace.\n\nHowever, other ecosystems are also looking to bank on this trend. For instance, Ordinex is developing an Ordinals trading platform, which will be accessible for Ethereum users through Metamask. Some Ethereum native projects, like OnChainBirds and SappySeals, have also inscribed the NFTs on Bitcoin and enabled trading on OpenSea. However, the trading activity of these collections remains average, with little hype.\n\nBesides Stacks, many other ecosystems are trying to bank on the opportunity by facilitating Bitcoin NFTs. While Stacks enjoys a technical advantage over others, Ethereum has a loyal user base and adequate liquidity to outperform Stacks\u2019 ecosystem if a feasible solution emerges. Moreover, in the end, it will depend on the response and demand of these NFTs from the Bitcoin community, which may not support euphoria around it.\n\nSTX/USD reaches key resistances zones\n\nThe STX token dilutes at the rate of 2.5% annually. The inflation will reduce after the Bitcoin halving, which is expected to occur in April 2024. The rate of supply increase of STX is low compared to other layer-1 blockchains like Solana and Cardano, which is encouraging. However, the network\u2019s total fees or token economics do not balance the inflation, which needs to change soon.\n\nTechnically, the STX/USD pair is near the top of its two-year trading range at $1.02, which is a potential yellow flag for buyers. If bulls are able to overcome this level, STX can possibly take a shot at the all-time highs near $3.00. However, given that network activity doesn\u2019t correlate to the price rise as of yet, there\u2019s a chance of a pullback toward $0.68 and $0.24.\n\nSTX/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSimilarly, the STX/BTC pair is also near its all-time range of 0.00004350 BTC, which raises the possibility of a correction once those levels are tagged. The downside targets of STX are at 0.00002744 BTC and 0.00001233 BTC.\n\nSTX/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin NFTs have a lot of potential, but it is still unclear if the Bitcoin community, which is usually against speculation and activities that clog the network, will allow the trend to prosper.\n\nCurrently, the most crucial aspect of NFT trading \u2014 an easily accessible marketplace and wallet \u2014 is still missing from the Ordinals ecosystem. As a Bitcoin sidechain, Stacks enjoys technical advantages with Bitcoin integration and it has a slight advantage over other blockchains in providing the tools to support an Ordinals craze.\n\nHowever, the applications to support Ordinals are still in development. Meanwhile, Stacks faces competition from other more liquid ecosystems, which could develop more feasible solutions to integrate Bitcoin NFTs on their chain.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Despite its revolutionary impact on the finance industry, Bitcoin still faces challenges in terms of scalability. With a processing capacity ranging from three to seven transactions in the real world, Bitcoin's transaction speed is significantly slower than traditional payment processors like VISA, making it unsuitable for everyday payments.\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin Lightning Network as a second-layer solution offers a potential solution. By setting up user payment channels, the Lightning Network provides instant transactions with lower fees while maintaining the Bitcoin network's security.\n\nBefore we dive deeper into all the details about the Bitcoin Lightning Network, let's get to know what it is and what it tries to achieve.\n\nWhat is the Bitcoin Lightning Network?\n\nThe Bitcoin Lightning Network is a second-layer payment protocol developed by Lightning Labs to enhance the capabilities of Bitcoin. It is a network of micropayment channels that allows users to send and receive payments instantaneously and without the high fees associated with Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe Lightning Network operates on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, which means that it benefits from the security of the blockchain. It also helps to reduce the congestion on the blockchain, which speeds up transaction times and reduces fees. This is achieved by using a system of payment channels, essentially private payment channels created between two users.\n\nUsing these payment channels, users can: send and receive Bitcoin in real time. Additionally, the Lightning Network allows for the creation of smart contracts and multi-signature scripts, which help to ensure that transactions are secure and reliable.\n\nThe Lightning Network also helps to reduce the energy consumption associated with Bitcoin transactions. As the number of Bitcoin transactions has grown, so has the energy required to process them. The Lightning Network addresses this issue by enabling off-chain transactions that do not require the same level of computation as traditional Bitcoin transactions.\n\nHow does the Bitcoin Lightning Network work in theory?\n\nTheoretically, the Lightning Network establishes a network of payment channels between users, enabling quick and safe transactions without needing the approval of the Bitcoin network. Users finance a payment channel using Bitcoin to start the process, after which they may rapidly and directly deal with one another.\n\nNodes are computers connected to the Lightning Network and used to transmit transaction information, making up this decentralized network. Nodes can serve as middlemen, enabling parties to do business without disclosing their names or locations. This configuration may speed up and improve the effectiveness of Bitcoin transactions. Usually, Bitcoin transactions require around 10 minutes to process, but confirmation times are nearly instantaneous thanks to the Lightning Network.\n\nEach node must place a particular bitcoin amount into a channel to access the Lightning Network. This ensures the node won't defraud or steal any money. When two nodes wish to communicate, they create a channel and engage in as many transactions as they like. When everything is done, they terminate the channel and send the Bitcoin to the right addresses.\n\nA promising technology for individuals interested in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, the Lightning Network has the potential to boost transaction speed and efficiency while lowering fees. The Lightning Network might have a bigger impact on the financial system as it develops and gets better.\n\nPros and cons of the Bitcoin Lightning Network\n\nPros\n\nInstant transactions : The Lightning Network allows for instant transactions between users on the Bitcoin network.\n\n: The Lightning Network allows for instant transactions between users on the Bitcoin network. Low fees : The Lightning Network allows for low transaction fees, making transacting on the Bitcoin network cheaper.\n\n: The Lightning Network allows for low transaction fees, making transacting on the Bitcoin network cheaper. Scalability: The Lightning Network improves the scalability of the Bitcoin network, allowing for more transactions to be processed per second.\n\nCons\n\nCentralization: The Lightning Network creates a network of payment channels centralized around nodes with more Bitcoin. This could lead to the centralization of the network and potential security risks.\n\nThe Lightning Network creates a network of payment channels centralized around nodes with more Bitcoin. This could lead to the centralization of the network and potential security risks. Liquidity: The Lightning Network requires users to have the liquidity to open payment channels. This could limit its adoption by users who do not have enough Bitcoin to fund channels.\n\nBitcoin Lightning Network stats\n\nThe Lightning Network has seen steady growth since its launch in 2018. One key measure of growth is the number of nodes on the network. As of February 2023, there are over 76,000 Lightning Network active channels, with around 16,000 online nodes. This indicates that the Lightning Network is increasingly decentralized, with nodes spread across different geographical locations.\n\nLightning network capacity\n\nThe Lightning Network's capacity has also been increasing steadily. As of January 2023, the total capacity of the Lightning Network has reached over 5,490 BTC, worth over $128 million. This is a significant increase from the early days of the network when the total capacity was just a few hundred Bitcoin. This capacity growth indicates that the Lightning Network is becoming a more attractive option for users who want to transact Bitcoin quickly and efficiently.\n\nLightning network channel size\n\nLightning network nodes and channels via https://explorer.acinq.co/\n\nThe average Lightning Network channel size is around 0.070 Bitcoin, which is equivalent to around $1,696. This indicates that the Lightning Network is being used for small transactions, which aligns with its intended use case. The Lightning Network aims to enable micropayments and fast transactions, and the small average channel size is evidence that it is achieving this goal.\n\nLightning network speed and scalability\n\nThe Lightning Network's speed and scalability are essential to its success, and it can process thousands of transactions per second. This is significantly higher than the Bitcoin blockchain's current capacity, around seven transactions per second. The Lightning Network's ability to process transactions quickly and efficiently is essential for micropayments and small transactions, which are often not feasible on the Bitcoin blockchain due to high transaction fees and slow confirmation times.\n\nBitcoin lightning network adoption\n\nFinally, the Lightning Network has gained significant adoption in the Bitcoin community, with several wallets and exchanges supporting Lightning transactions. Merchants and businesses have also started accepting Lightning payments. This adoption is a crucial factor in the Lightning Network's success. It enables more users to transact using Lightning channels, increasing the network's usage and adoption.\n\nHow can I invest in the Bitcoin Lightning Network?\n\nIf you're interested in investing in the Lightning Network, there are two primary ways.\n\nPurchase and Hold Bitcoin\n\nPurchasing and holding Bitcoin is a straightforward way to invest in the Lightning Network. To begin, you must create an account with a reliable platform like YouHodler. Once you've signed up, you can purchase Bitcoin with fiat currency, stablecoins or even cryptocurrency.\n\nAfter purchasing Bitcoin, you can transfer it to a secure YouHodler wallet. By holding Bitcoin, you're indirectly investing in the Lightning Network since the network's growth and demand is closely tied to the adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nBenefits of Purchasing and Holding Bitcoin:\n\nYou can benefit from the Bitcoin and Lightning networks' growth.\n\nYou can store your Bitcoin in a secure wallet, away from potential security threats on exchanges.\n\nYou can sell your Bitcoin anytime, allowing you to liquidate your investment quickly.\n\nRun a Lightning Node\n\nRunning a Lightning node is another way to invest in the Lightning Network. By operating a node, you can help facilitate Bitcoin transactions on the network and earn small amounts of Bitcoin in transaction fees. You'll need some technical knowledge and equipment to run a Lightning node.\n\nHere are the steps to set up a Lightning node:\n\nChoose a Lightning Network client : There are several Lightning Network clients available, including LND, C-Lightning, and Eclair.

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies closed out February largely unchanged as an enthusiastic rally to kick off 2023 stalled in the year's second month.\n\nIn February, ether (ETH-USD), the market's second-largest cryptocurrency, outpaced its larger peer bitcoin (BTC-USD) rising 1.6% against bitcoin's more modest 0.4% increase during the month. In January, bitcoin gained nearly 40% to record its best start to a year since 2013.\n\nChristopher Newhouse, a crypto options trader with GSR, said the February action in bitcoin was \"definitely more boring for directional trading than in January.\"\n\nAs Newhouse explained, crypto derivatives trading volume remained high in February but volatility fizzled over the month. Bitcoin is still the most popular cryptocurrency for traders, but in recent weeks those bets \"toward the end of the month have been mixed or slightly bearish.\"\n\nOver the same period, the major U.S. indexes were lower, with the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) falling 2.5% during the month.\n\n\"Only short-term interest in Bitcoin was tepid,\" Michael Safai, co-founder and partner of crypto trading firm, Dexterity Capital told Yahoo Finance. Safai pointed to U.S. regulatory crackdowns over recent weeks as another reason investors may be taking a more cautious approach to cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn an annual report filed Monday afternoon, Robinhood (HOOD) shared the latest regulatory probe, alerting investors that the SEC subpoenaed the company in December to inquire about how it lists and holds cryptocurrencies in custody.\n\n\"There's still optimism that things will start to get figured out in the coming months,\" Safai added, pointing to longer-dated bitcoin call options placed this month with a strike price of $30,000.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, bitcoin watchers have focused closely on whether bitcoin's price can breach $25,000. Between February 19-20, the level was briefly reached. Bitcoin has since fallen more than 6% and is currently changing hands near $23,200.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBitcoin is comfortably in a trading range and that might be the case for a while longer,\u201d said Edward Moya, senior analyst with Oanda.\n\nBased on historical data compiled by Yahoo Finance, in March bitcoin has shown a positive return in only three of the past nine years. On average, the coin has shown a loss of approximately 5.3%\n\nA man wears a t-shirt with the logo of Bitcoin as he waits for Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of crypto currency exchange FTX, to attend a hearing at the Magistrate Court building in Nassau, Bahamas December 19, 2022.

        "content": "Cointelegraph\u2019s Crypto Trading Secrets podcast has published Episode 6, covering an array of content that should pique the interest of cryptocurrency traders. This episode\u2019s guest is Brian Krogsgard, also known as Ledgerstatus on Twitter. Krogsgard is a trader and one of the co-founders of Flip.xyz, a nonfungible token (NFT) platform. He is also a podcaster in the crypto space.\n\nAmong the questions fielded during the Feb. 16 recording, host Benjamin Pirus asked Krogsgard to give his opinion on what he thinks has most impacted the price of Bitcoin (BTC) over the past year. \u201cLiquidity,\u201d he responded.\n\n\u201cPeople just do not have spare liquidity for a multitude of reasons. They have counterparties that went bankrupt, and that might have forced them to lose money. They got coins stuck on places that went bankrupt. Lost access to them, lost in trading, lost because of taxes, whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are all challenges for liquidity, and you need liquidity for the healthiest of markets, and so that\u2019s been a challenge,\u201d he added. Amid the runaway train that was the 2022 crypto bear market, the space saw significant turmoil. Several cryptocurrency companies failed, including the likes of crypto exchange giant FTX.\n\n\u201cI would actually say the problems go way before that with Bitcoin because we saw with FTX there was massive rehypothecation of Bitcoin,\u201d Krogsgard continued. \u201cRehypothecation\u201d is when entities use customers\u2019 collateral for other activities, according to Investopedia. The collapse of FTX in November 2022 sparked numerous headlines, such as allegations of customer asset misuse by FTX and sister entity Alameda Research.\n\n\u201cSo, the Bitcoin people thought they had on FTX was not there, and FTX was selling it to do other things. And that rehypothecation was actually a burden to Bitcoin\u2019s price even in a bull market. And now that we have liquidity issues, it\u2019s just been a consistent kind of drag on price and presented challenges for a year and then some.\u201d\n\nKrogsgard provided his thoughts and opinions on several other points during the episode and also chatted about his background.\n\nCheck out this and other episodes from Cointelegraph\u2019s Crypto Trading Secrets podcast on Cointelegraph\u2019s podcast page, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts or TuneIn.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "content": "For a niche subset of the Bitcoin maximalist circles, Ordinal Inscriptions have surprisingly and swiftly developed an outsized footprint in the cryptocurrency community. As of February 28, more than 210,000 of these digital assets have been inscribed\u2014from a copy of Doom to a CryptoPunks-inspired collection\u2014and upwards of $1.31 million has been spent in mining fees.\n\nLike NFTs, which are typically linked to the Ethereum network, Ordinal Inscriptions are digital assets that are inscribed on a satoshi, which is the smallest denomination of Bitcoin.\n\nBut unlike NFTs, which can be purchased via platforms like OpenSea and Nifty Gateway, Ordinals are bought and sold on Telegram and Discord channels, as marketplaces or even dedicated wallets for Bitcoin Ordinals have yet to take off.\n\nSo what accounts for their popularity?\n\n5/ It feels like fun early-days alpha Swapping Ordinals in small Discord channels via trusted OTC in an awkward way is exactly what alpha tastes like. You have a passionate group of people who see something special even though the tooling is incredibly bad \u2014 dotta (@dotta) February 1, 2023\n\nDevelopers have been striving to integrate NFTs onto the top blockchain, Bitcoin, for almost a decade. This journey began in 2014 with Counterparty, which created the Rare Pepe NFT collection, and continued in 2017 with Stacks. The inscription process involves writing the content data into the witness, or authenticating signature, of the Bitcoin transaction.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain can technically support the creation of NFTs, it was not designed with this specific use case in mind, but rather developed to provide a secure, immutable ledger of peer-to-peer transactions. Other blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, were designed with more flexible programming languages and smart contract capabilities that allowed for the creation and management of NFTs from the outset.\n\nDid you know that ordinals are not the first NFTs on Bitcoin? In fact, Bitcoin has had NFTs for nearly a decade! In 2015 Spells of Genesis tokenized the first gaming assets and in 2016 Rare Pepes gave birth to the cryptoart movement. pic.twitter.com/NibfcKxNRZ \u2014 Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) February 15, 2023\n\nTechnical details aside, the ability to add inscriptions onto the Bitcoin blockchain has prompted some rather uncanny depictions.\n\nBlock 0, the genesis Ordinal block, pays tribute to the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, featuring an interlocking looped GIF of a 3D block, created with ASCII text, spinning against lines from Satoshi\u2019s original white paper.\n\nThe second block of Ordinals paid homage to Hal Finney, the first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto. Block 1 showcases the hash of the block containing Finney\u2019s transaction and features abstract art that symbolizes the impact of ALS, a disease that had a debilitating effect on Finney\u2019s health.\n\nThen, there were the Ordinal Punks, a set of 100 NFTs nodding to the original CryptoPunks, minted within the first 650 inscriptions on the Bitcoin chain. The 192\u00d7192-pixel generative PFP collection was created using an open-source algorithm by the pseudonymous Web3 creator, FlowStay.\n\nThe novelty and relative scarcity of Oridinal Punks have fueled their rise in value. According to a Google Sheet database of sales (again, there are no major marketplaces for Ordinals), the current lowest bid for an Ordinal Punk sits at 3.7 BTC, or 51.26 ETH (nearly $84,000), and the highest asking price is 50 BTC, or 692.66 ETH ($1,132,500).\n\nOn February 27, Yuga Labs announced that it would be launching an Ordinals collection of its own, a collection of 300 generative art NFTs.\n\nIntroducing TwelveFold. A limited edition collection of 300 generative pieces, inscribed on satoshis on the Bitcoin blockchain.https://t.co/aFWEIhzqcI pic.twitter.com/PjWABKKBr4 \u2014 Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) February 27, 2023\n\nIn line with Yuga Labs\u2019s buy-in, a host of services have emerged over the past month to provide support for Ordinal transactions, not limited to Bitcoin wallets like Xverse and Hiro Wallet, and NFT marketplaces including Gamma and Oridalsbot.\n\nBut are Ordinals more than a fad?\n\nLike any niche collectible, including art, the market that develops around Ordinals is only as big as the bags of those willing to purchase it. But Bitcoin, with a current market cap of $449.21 billion, is by far the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, far outstripping the $199.70 billion cap of Ethereum.\n\nAs it is, the momentum of Ordinals has yet to falter, being boosted by alphas in the space, burgeoning market interest, and, as with most things in the crypto sphere, no small amount of hype. Research firm Delphi Digital, for one, has dubbed the emergence of Ordinals \u201cBitcoin\u2019s New Narrative,\u201d calling them \u201cthe most interesting thing to happen to Bitcoin since El Salvador made it legal tender.\u201d\n\nFor now, though, Ordinals remain closer to 4Chan than Hauser & Wirth. Whatever art that gets transcribed onto the Bitcoin network will likely not (yet) constitute some broader art historical turn or pivot, but rather something much simpler: A small, three or four MB file, tick-tock, next block.\n\nMore Trending Stories:\n\nResearchers in Vietnam Discovered That Two Deer Antlers Languishing in Museum Storage Are Actually 2,000-Year-Old Musical Instruments\n\nA Photographer Who Found Instagram Fame for His Striking Portraits Has Confessed His Images Were Actually A.I.-Generated\n\nArchaeologists on Easter Island Have Discovered a Previously Unknown Moai Statue Buried in a Dried-Out Lake Bed\n\nTwo Curators Tried to Find Out If Salvador Dal\u00ed Really Painted This Strange Seven-Foot Canvas.

        "title": "How this mining pool strives to make Bitcoin greener - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) miners consume massive amounts of energy to secure the network and process transactions. While the network offers many benefits, like banking the unbanked, Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption is a controversial topic for critics. However, new solutions are emerging to reduce the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance estimates that the Bitcoin network currently consumes about 109.34 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year. Bitcoin miners use this energy to generate hash keys. When they guess the correct key, they receive BTC as a reward for their contribution to securing the network.\n\nCambridge Center for Alternative Finance\n\nThe current electricity demand is at record heights, and there is a new influx of miners. However, many miners still rely on fossil fuels, contributing to the network\u2019s reliance on dirty energy sources.\n\nEnvironmental concerns\n\nMost of the world is pursuing a green transition, stepping away from fossil fuels as much as possible. With Bitcoin relying on its proof-of-work (PoW) protocol, the network is targeted by critics like Greenpeace, as it does not align with the organization\u2019s mission to make the world\u2019s industries more sustainable. In addition, Bitcoin\u2019s reputation is at stake, with governments mulling over strict regulations for the mining industry and brands like Tesla dropping BTC as a payment method.\n\nIn other words, this stride for sustainability is also relevant for the Bitcoin mining community. A switch to sustainable energy sources seems like a logical step to take, but it isn\u2019t the easiest. In many countries, fossil fuels are simply the cheapest option, making them the first choice for miners.\n\nCurrently, many different initiatives are pushing Bitcoin in a greener direction. For example, miners can minimize methane\u2019s environmental impact by converting flared methane and vented landfill gasses into electricity. What\u2019s more, smaller miners can now also contribute to the green effort by joining mining pools like PEGA Pool.\n\nAccelerating Bitcoin\u2019s green future\n\nPEGA Pool, a platform based in the United Kingdom, is one of the newest mining pools in the industry. Of course, mining in a network, joining forces with other miners and earning BTC together is nothing new. PEGA Pool, however, offers miners a way to make their operations more sustainable.\n\nThere are several ways this mining pool makes the work of participating miners more sustainable. First, miners that use sustainable energy resources get a 50% reduction in pool fees, giving clean energy sources an advantage over other participants in the PEGA mining pool.\n\nSecondly, miners using \u201cdirtier\u201d energy sources are also welcome to join. However, PEGA Pool reserves a portion of the fees these miners pay to offset their environmental impact. More specifically, the project uses the fees to plant new trees, which capture the carbon these miners emit while mining Bitcoin.\n\nPEGA Pool might be a relatively new platform, but its green mission has already attracted many miners. According to blockchain explorer BTC.com, the pool already ranks among the biggest mining pools in the industry, taking the 11th spot on the list. Currently, it produces a hash rate of 2875.62 peta hashes per second, closely following Poolin. The pool has already mined 771 Bitcoin by mining 121 blocks, all with minimal environmental impact.\n\nGreen initiatives like PEGA Pool may positively impact the future of Bitcoin, even if it is unlikely that Bitcoin will join Ethereum in its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. However, mining can become a more sustainable industry by focusing on renewable energy. In turn, it can increase the demand for renewable energy, possibly benefiting more than just the miners themselves. Miners looking to make their operation greener can find more information about PEGA Pool on its official website.\n\nLearn more about PEGA Pool"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nYuga Labs, the $4 billion company behind dominant NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club, will debut its first-ever Bitcoin-based NFT project later this week, the company announced Monday.\n\nThe collection, TwelveFold, will consist of 300 limited-edition generative art pieces each inscribed to the Bitcoin blockchain. It\u2019s one of the highest-profile launches to date via Ordinals, a recently-launched way of committing artwork and media to Bitcoin by permanently attaching each to an individual Satoshi, or 1/100,000,000 of a full Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe pieces, all 12x12 grids\u2014an homage to the manner in which data is stored on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014will combine 3D graphics and hand-drawn features. The project was designed and created by Yuga\u2019s in-house art team, and the company said that it has no connection to its Ethereum-based IP and will have no future interactions or utility in that regard.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPromotional artwork for Yuga Labs' first Bitcoin NFT project. Image: Yuga Labs\n\nTwelveFold marks a departure from Yuga\u2019s past offerings in a few key ways. Most notably, every other project under the Yuga banner currently lives on the Ethereum blockchain, the leading network for NFT projects.\n\nThat list includes the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), spinoff Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and virtual land plots for the upcoming Otherside metaverse game. Yuga Labs also owns CryptoPunks and Meebits, two \u201cblue chip\u201d Ethereum NFT projects created by Larva Labs that Yuga purchased the IP rights to last year.\n\nTwelveFold also stands apart from those projects in terms of size. Whereas all other Yuga-owned collections boast 10,000 or more NFTs, TwelveFold will consist of only 300 pieces. It\u2019s closer in approach to Autoglyphs, an influential Larva Labs generative art project on Ethereum that spans just 512 NFTs.\n\n\u201cAll of these choices are a departure from what\u2019s expected from Yuga,\u201d co-founder Greg Solano wrote in a blog post accompanying Monday's announcement. \u201cBut, you know. Fuck doing expected things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about Ordinal inscriptions and what the future holds for digital artifacts on Bitcoin,\u201d he continued. Yuga said that it will announce auction details later this week, and that the information will come 24 hours in advance of the actual sale.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the generative art pieces in Yuga Labs' TwelveFold series. Image: Yuga Labs\n\nOrdinals have commanded the attention of the NFT world over the past month, and while the idea of NFT-like assets imprinted on the blockchain has irked some Bitcoin maximalists, it\u2019s catching on in a big way. More than 200,000 unique Ordinals have been minted as of today, including from notable projects like DeGods and OnChain Monkey. There are even CryptoPunks clones on Bitcoin now.\n\nYuga\u2019s foray into Bitcoin NFTs also comes at a time when the company\u2019s most stable revenue stream appears to be in jeopardy. NFT creators like Yuga depend on creator royalties\u2014a fee typically between 5% and 10%\u2014levied on secondary sales of NFTs on Ethereum marketplaces like OpenSea.\n\nEarlier this month, however, OpenSea stopped enforcing some royalties in an effort to stave off competition from its emergent rival, NFT trading platform Blur. Yuga Labs had previously criticized OpenSea for considering the move."

        "title": "Inflationary vs. deflationary cryptocurrencies, Explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is an inflationary cryptocurrency? Some cryptocurrencies are inflationary because the supply of coins increases over time. Inflationary cryptocurrencies use a combination of predetermined inflation rates, supply constraints, and mechanisms for distributing tokens to maintain the supply and incentivize participation in the network. Looking at their monetary systems, cryptocurrencies have various coin-creation and supply mechanisms. Inflationary cryptocurrencies have a steadily increasing supply of coins entering the cryptocurrency market. Typically, there is a predetermined rate of inflation set, which specifies the percentage increase in the currency\u2019s total supply over time. Moreover, the inflationary token\u2019s maximum supply is usually fixed or variable, setting the total number of tokens that can be created. Once the maximum supply is reached, no more tokens can be minted. Nonetheless, different cryptocurrencies still have varying tokenomics, which may be adjusted over time. For instance, Dogecoin (DOGE) once had a hard cap of 100 billion tokens until the supply cap was removed in 2014. With this decision, DOGE now has an unlimited supply of coins. How does an inflationary cryptocurrency work? Inflationary cryptocurrencies distribute newly minted coins to network participants utilizing dedicated consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS), through which new coins can either be mined into existence (Bitcoin (BTC)) or distributed to network validators (Ether (ETH)). Through Bitcoin\u2019s PoW consensus mechanism, miners validate transactions and are rewarded based on who solves the puzzle first. In PoS, when a block of transactions is ready to be processed, the PoS protocol will choose a validator node to review the block. The validator checks if the transactions in the block are accurate. If so, the validator adds the block to the blockchain and receives ETH rewards for their contribution, generally proportional to the validator\u2019s stake. In some cryptocurrencies, the distribution of new tokens can be influenced by governance decisions. For example, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) may vote to release treasury funds, change staking rewards and set vesting periods, ultimately affecting the currency\u2019s inflation rate and the distribution of new tokens.\n\nWhat is a deflationary cryptocurrency? Deflationary cryptocurrencies deflate over time because the supply decreases. Deflationary tokens use various mechanisms to reduce their supply, with coins usually destroyed through transaction fees and coin burning. Deflationary cryptocurrencies have a predetermined deflation rate coded in the protocol. This rate determines the percentage decrease in the currency\u2019s total supply over time. For instance, a cryptocurrency might have an annual deflation rate of 2.5%, meaning that the currency\u2019s total supply will decrease by 2.5% annually. Like many inflationary cryptocurrencies, deflationary cryptocurrencies can have a fixed or variable maximum supply that limits the total number of tokens created. Generally, no more units can be minted once the supply limit is reached, but this is not always the case. Notably, the economics of deflationary cryptocurrencies is influenced by stakeholders\u2019 incentives, including miners, developers and users, who have varying motivations and goals that impact the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply and demand. Miners mine new coins into existence and tend to hold newly mined coins in bull markets instead of selling them on the market. Likewise, supply caps can be removed, like in the case of DOGE, making some cryptocurrencies prone to manipulation. How does a deflationary cryptocurrency work? Deflationary cryptocurrencies may have direct or indirect mechanisms to destroy circulating coins. Some deflationary currencies may use transaction fees to facilitate burning to reduce the total number of coins in circulation. Coin burning may also involve sending a specific amount of coins to an inaccessible address, directly removing them from circulation. BNB (BNB) adopted two coin-burning mechanisms, reducing its supply by 50% over time. The first is burning a portion of the BNB spent as gas fees on the BNB Chain, and the second is quarterly BNB burning events. Deflationary cryptocurrencies also use other instruments to reduce token supply, including \u201chalving.\u201d Roughly every four years, the halving event cuts the ming rewards BTC miners receive for their work, directly affecting BTC\u2019s scarcity.\n\nWhat is the difference between inflationary and deflationary cryptocurrencies? Inflationary and deflationary cryptocurrencies differ in their monetary mechanisms and supply dynamics. These distinctions have significant implications for the usage and value of each type of cryptocurrency. Both deflationary and inflationary cryptocurrencies can have unique tokenomics that impact their value and use. Deflationary cryptocurrencies typically have a fixed total coin supply limit, which results in increased purchasing power over time. Inflationary cryptocurrencies often have a flexible coin creation rate, arguably decreasing purchasing power over time. Inflationary cryptocurrencies offer some advantages over deflationary ones. They incentivize spending and discourage hoarding. Depending on the use case, they may allow for increased liquidity and rapid adoption, either due to their utility or functionality as a medium of exchange. Additionally, they arguably offer a more flexible monetary policy than deflationary cryptocurrencies and some fiat currencies. The token\u2019s inflation can be adjusted to match the ecosystem\u2019s needs, such as fund development, incentivizing participation or counteracting inflationary pressure from the fiat legacy systems. Deflationary cryptocurrencies incentivize holding and discourage spending, increasing scarcity and adoption of the currency as a store of value. Additionally, deflationary cryptocurrencies can hedge against inflation, hyperinflation and stagflation, preserving value over time. The decreasing token supply can counteract inflationary pressure caused by external factors, including government policies or economic events.\n\nIs Bitcoin inflationary or deflationary? The classification of Bitcoin (BTC) as either inflationary or deflationary depends on various factors. BTC is inflationary because new coins are continuously mined and enter the supply. However, disinflationary measures, such as halving, reduce inflation over time. The argument for BTC being deflationary is based on the fact that the supply of BTC is limited and inherently incorporates a disinflationary measure called halving. The halving event cuts the rewards for miners, affecting BTC\u2019s scarcity and reducing inflation over time. As the mining reward continues to fall over time, it becomes increasingly difficult and expensive to mine BTC. The 21 million cap on supply means once all coins are mined, no more are added to the market. Once BTC\u2019s hard cap is reached around the year 2140, inflation stops because no new coins will be added into circulation. Finally, as the adoption and demand for BTC continue to increase due to rising external demand and its internal disinflationary mechanics, its price could continue to increase. BTC can hedge against inflation due to its internal mechanics, which gradually reduce its inflation rate."

        "title": "Wrapped Bitcoin supply drops to negative after 11,500 wBTC burn linked to Celsius - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The supply of wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) dropped to its lowest since May 2021 after the second-largest single-day burn on Feb. 27.\n\nA total of 11,500 wBTC ($260 million) linked to now-bankrupt crypto lender Celsius was burned, turning its growth rate negative. The current total supply of the wrapped token is 164,396 wBTC, with a monthly growth rate of -7.39%.\n\nwBTC daily mint and burn. Source: Dune\n\nWBTC is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token that mirrors the value of Bitcoin and is pegged 1:1 with the price of Bitcoin (BTC). Bitgo co-developed wBTC in 2019 alongside blockchain interoperability protocol Ren and multichain liquidity platform Kyber. WBTC is managed by the decentralized autonomous organization wBTC DAO, which comprises over 30 members.\n\nWhen merchants want to exchange BTC for wBTC, they start a burn transaction and alert the custodians. The merchant transfers real BTC to a custodian address on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is locked. Once it receives the real BTC, the custodian address mints the equivalent amount in wBTC on Ethereum.\n\nBeing an ERC-20 token makes the transfer of wBTC faster than normal Bitcoin, but the key advantage of wBTC is its integration into the world of Ethereum wallets, decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nDuring the peak of the bull run, wrapped tokens became a popular tool of use in the decentralized finance ecosystem. WBTC\u2019s supply peaked at 285,000 in April 2022, when the price of BTC was trading above $48,000.\n\nHowever, with the advent of the bear market and numerous crypto contagions, the demand started to fade away. The first signs of lowering demand came after the Terra collapse, which forced several crypto lenders to redeem their wBTC. According to one report, Celsius Network redeemed about 9,000 wBTC amid a growing withdrawal demand.\n\nRelated: Celsius Network coin report shows a balance gap of $2.85 billion\n\nA similar scenario occurred in November 2022 after the FTX collapse, where reports indicate the now-bankrupt crypto exchange tried redeeming 3,000 wBTC just before filing for bankruptcy. After the FTX collapse in November, wBTC experienced its largest monthly coin redemption, with over 28,000 wBTC redeemed back to the original coin.\n\nInteresting nugget from today's $WBTC Twitter Space w/ @BitGo and @KyberNetwork:\n\n\n\nDuring FTX turmoil, someone from Alameda tried to redeem 3k WBTC for BTC.\n\n\n\nBitGo refused to honor.\n\n\n\nTokens were burned anyway.\n\n\n\nBitGo isn't sure what to do w/ the 3k BTC.https://t.co/A1wYY72skb \u2014 Chris Blec (@ChrisBlec) December 14, 2022\n\nThe market contagion caused by the FTX collapse also depegged wBTC from the original value of BTC. Although the slippage was just about 1.5%, it raised serious concerns about whether such synthetic tokens were a viable mode of value transfer."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn Northeast Pennsylvania, a unique Bitcoin mining experiment is about to come online.\n\nCalled Nautilus, Terawulf is spinning up a nuclear-powered mining facility.\n\nFirst announced back in 2021, Terawulf said that when Nautilus is at full capacity later in Q1 this year, the facility\u2019s fleet of 15,000 mining rigs will have a hash rate of 1.6 exahashes per second (EH/s). That amounts to 1.6 quintillion hashes every second, or about 0.54% of the total computational power of the entire Bitcoin mining network today, which is currently running at 294.09 EH/s.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore importantly, though, none of this new mining capacity will be powered by fossil fuels, potentially addressing years-long criticism of the premier cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin uses a proof-of-work (PoW) mining algorithm to validate transactions and secure the network. Miners, or computers optimized for verifying transactions and getting rewarded in Bitcoin, currently consume around 117 terawatt hours a year\u2014the equivalent of a small country.\n\nThis figure doesn\u2019t look like it will be slowing down anytime soon, either, as miners continue to deploy updated machines and even whole new fleets. The amount of global computing power used to mine Bitcoin, understood as hash rate, has been on a steady rise since 2016.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s global hash rate since inception. Source: CoinWarz .\n\nIt\u2019s not just miners watching this chart, either. With roughly 62% of the current energy mix powering all those machines coming from fossil fuels, regulators are taking note too.\n\nJust last year, New York signed a two-year moratorium banning any new fossil-fuel-powered Bitcoin miners to set up shop within state boundaries. A similar proposal targeting proof-of-work (PoW) mining was also put before European lawmakers, who comfortably voted it down.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen asked if he had any concerns about a regulatory clampdown on PoW-based mining, Terawulf\u2019s co-founder, CTO, and COO Nazar Khan told Decrypt that he hopes \u201cthey take input from people like ourselves.\u201d\n\nTerawulf takes aim at green Bitcoin mining\n\nFounded in 2021 by Nazar Khan and Paul Prager, who were senior executives of Beowulf, an energy infrastructure company Prager had launched in 1990, Terawulf pitched itself as a \u201cleading sustainable Bitcoin mining company.\u201d\n\nWhen he began learning more about crypto in 2017, Khan had already spent over twenty years developing and operating power-generation facilities in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n\u201cOnce I started to understand how Bitcoin mining worked, it was clear to me that efficient and economic Bitcoin mining was heavily dependent on infrastructure and the cost of energy,\u201d Khan says of his early days networking with miners.\n\n\u201cPick the name of a Bitcoin miner and I\u2019ve probably talked to them at some point, trying to find a way to work together,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cI said, \u2018hey, I know power, I know energy, let me find someone who knows Bitcoin mining.\u2019 It became very clear to me that the level of sophistication in the space around energy, energy procurement, and development was very low.\u201d\n\nA year before founding Terawulf, Khan\u2019s team had also completed the construction of a large-scale facility for Marathon, one of the world\u2019s largest mining companies.\n\nThis collaboration was followed by a call from energy company Talen, whose subsidiary, Cumulus Data, had built a data center adjoining the parent company\u2019s 2.5 gigawatt Susquehanna nuclear power plant to host Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nThus, Nautilus was born.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdd Nautilus\u2019 stats to the projected 3.8 EH/s capability of Terawulf\u2019s hydro-powered Lake Mariner facility on the western side of the state of New York and it\u2019s clear that Terawulf will have one of the biggest Bitcoin mining operations in the world, powered almost exclusively by renewable energy.\n\nBut it's about more than crypto miners tapping into abundant clean energy.\n\nKhan said how the Terawulf team\u2019s long experience in energy infrastructure can also help make operations like Nautilus and Lake Mariner reliable consumers of Talen\u2019s excess renewably-sourced electricity, but also responsive assets for local electrical grid operators.\n\nThe term \u201casset\u201d broadly refers to mining farms that are both useful to have on a grid, and intangible assets to energy providers, offering high customer lifetime value (CLV)\u2014essentially the value derived from having regular, dependable customers\u2014thanks to their strategic locations that can keep energy prices low.\n\nIt\u2019s all about location\n\nIn 2016, Beowulf parent company Riesling Power LLC bought a decommissioned coal plant in Somerset, on the western side of New York state. The Paris Agreement had been signed in New York City the previous year, leading to a 76% reduction in plans for new coal plants across the globe. The team knew they were essentially buying the plant to retire it.\n\nThe plant was integrated into the state grid through a network of transmission lines\u2014those thick cables you see held up by imposing towers along global motorways. When it was operational, the transmission lines were rigged to move 700 megawatts of power out of the plant and onto the grid.\n\nDue to Khan\u2019s professional background in energy infrastructure, though, he knew Terawulf could just as easily move 700 megawatts of power into the site to feed a fleet of Bitcoin miners.\n\nKhan then began sourcing energy for the site and found that the local zone (Zone A) of the grid\u2014which is controlled by a not-for-profit company called the New York System Independent System Operator (NYISO)\u2014produces \u201cabout four to five gigawatts\u201d of power drawing from primarily renewable sources, namely hydroelectric power.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy March 2022, Terawulf\u2019s first Bitcoin mine was operational: Lake Mariner.\n\nOf that five gigawatts, local demand only soaks up \u201ca gig or a gig and a half\u201d leaving an excess generation of more than three gigawatts to be conducted by transmission lines across the state, mostly to feed the Big Apple\u2019s energy demands, known to the power industry as the \u201cNew York City load pocket.\u201d\n\nKnowing local energy demands is key for strategically placing mining plants. If you position massive electrical loads in areas of high demand, you\u2019re not only going to get high prices, you may drive them up further.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is one of the most efficient and economic load sinks around,\u201d Khan explained. \u201cWe\u2019re locating our loads in places where there\u2019s high electricity supply and not much demand, so we can be a \u2018sink\u2019 to soak up energy at attractive prices while providing a way to sell electricity in places where there typically aren\u2019t many buyers.\u201d\n\nLocation is everything, but even more so for renewables. Nuclear reactors and hydroelectric plants don\u2019t stop generating, and these facilities sometimes run for years without stopping.\n\nAnd just as not having enough energy can cause rolling blackouts, like what was seen in Texas last year, having too much energy can be just as dangerous for a grid.\n\nHerein lies another potential advantage of well-placed mining outfits.\n\nThey can turn machines off almost instantly during high demand or skim off excess energy from a grid when there's a high supply.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGrid operators' minds blown\n\nThe grid is designed to meet peak demand plus a margin, but it only hits peak demand for 50-100 hours a year, says Khan.\n\nThat\u2019s generally not something to worry about for a mining farm soaking up abundant clean energy in a low-demand area, but if the grid gets too heated, Terawulf\u2019s mines\u2014and Bitcoin mines in general\u2014can drop their demands in seconds.\n\nThis is thanks to a tool at grid operators\u2019 disposal called Automatic Generation Control (AGC). AGC adjusts the output of generators at different power plants in a given area of the grid to maintain a balance between generation in a given area (the power produced) and electrical load (the power consumed).\n\nIf a grid operator needs to add 15 or 25 megawatts to an area where the load is tight, Khan explains, they send a signal to a power plant in an area with excess generation to tell it to come down. In other words, when operators need to add generation to an area, they have to bring it down somewhere else.\n\nTypically, AGC has a 15-minute response time, so from the moment the grid operators send the signal to the plant to the moment the plant has achieved its satisfactory level, a quarter of an hour has passed.\n\nFor Bitcoin mining, the response time is more like fifteen seconds.\n\n\u201c[Grid operators\u2019] mind is kind of blown when they think about it,\u201d said Khan. \u201cWe have a load that\u2019s responsive in 10, 20, 50, 100 megawatts in less than a minute, and you can bring it back up just as quickly. That kind of responsiveness is unheard of, and when operators understand how responsive we can be, they\u2019re enamored with it.\u201d\n\nThis rapid response time is due to the fact that a typical top-of-the-line Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or mining machine can be turned off in less than a minute, making even a fleet of them more responsive than a nuclear generator.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe signal to turn off can also be scheduled a day ahead or in real time with no difference in the ability of the electric load to respond. This isn\u2019t the case with most industrial-scale loads.\n\nSeen this way, miners like Terawulf emerge less as pioneers of green crypto mining, and more as another tool that grid operators can turn to maintain a delicate balance of supply and demand.\n\nMiners can change their needs on a dime, soaking up excess energy when there's a glut of energy, or turning their machines off in the case of higher demands elsewhere."

TwelveFold NFT is a generative art collection inscribed in Satoshis, the smallest recognizable part of the Bitcoin blockchain. The NFTs combine featured 3D animations with hand-painted elements.\n\nHere\u2019s how Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano explained the idea behind the first Bitcoin NFT collection:\n\n\u201cTwelveFold is a base 12 art system localized around a 12x12 grid, a visual allegory for the cartography of data on the Bitcoin blockchain.\u201d\n\nIntroducing TwelveFold.

However, the ground-breaking news painted a bullish pattern for the Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), as trading volume soared 43% on OpenSea. In addition, the news positively impacted Bored Ape Kennel Club and Otherdeed for Otherside NFT projects, with 16% and 6% daily gains, respectively.\n\nMoreover, the Yuga Labs Satoshi-inscribed collection rides the wave of Ordinals.

        "title": "Ordinals on Bitcoin without SegWit and Taproot - CoinGeek",
        "content": "This post was first published on Medium.\n\nOrdinals has become a hot topic in BTC circles to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its main feature is storing the NFT itself entirely on chain.\n\nWe show that the original Bitcoin protocol can already support it. No breaking changes, including both SegWit and Taproot, are needed for Ordinals to work. Actually, it works better on the original protocol: 100,000X cheaper and 12.5X bigger.\n\nHow Ordinals Works\n\nOrdinals is the latest manifestation of color coins, which marks individual satoshis (thus \u201ccoloring\u201d them) such that they can carry extra information. More specifically, every satoshi is sequentially ordered based on the time it is mined, which was first proposed in the Bitcoin forum in 2012. Each satoshi will have an ordinal number between 0 and 2,100,000,000,000,000 (hence the term \u201cordinals\u201d) assigned. Each unique satoshi can then be inscribed with some other information to create NFTs (aka inscriptions).\n\nWhen an Ordinal NFT is minted in a transaction, it is inscribed on the first satoshi of the first output of the transaction. The transaction contains some extra data: text, images, videos, etc. Afterward, it can be transferred just like regular bitcoins.\n\nConsider an example transaction with three inputs and two outputs.\n\nThere are six satoshis from three addresses in the inputs. The outputs contain five satoshis to two different addresses. The remaining one satoshi is used as a fee to pay the miner.\n\nOrdinals uses the first-in-first-out algorithm to assign each satoshi of the inputs to the outputs. Any missing ordinals go to the miner. In the example, Ordinals (and their represented NFTs, if any) A, B, C, and D go to the first output, F to the second, and F to the miner.\n\nCompare with other Bitcoin-based NFTs\n\nPrevious colored coins usually use OP_RETURN, an unspendable output with only 80 bytes of metadata maximally, which means a link/reference to NFT is stored.\n\nOrdinals stores the entire NFT image/content on-chain using these techniques.\n\nThe Taproot upgrade in 2021 removed the data limit entirely, as long as it fits inside a block. Segregated Witness (Segwit) software upgrade in 2017 allows up to 3MB of witness data to be stored \u2018outside\u2019 of the 1MB block limit. Together, they provide up to 4MB worth of storage space for the inscription content. Inscriptions are stored in an \u201cenvelope\u201d between Opcodes OP_IF and OP_ENDIF. OP_FALSE precedes OP_IF to ensure that this data is never actually used in script execution and does not take up stack space. No OP_RETURN is used, and the output containing an inscription is spendable and thus unprunable. The following example inscribes the text \u201cHello, world!\u201d:\n\nOrdinals on Bitcoin SV\n\nThe original Bitcoin protocol of today, Bitcoin SV (BSV), pioneered storing NFT entirely on chain as early as 2021. Since BSV and BTC share the same algorithm for issuing satoshis, they can assign satoshis ordinal numbers in the same way. Ordinals on BSV works overwhelmingly better than on BTC.\n\nCost: BTC fees are around 10 sat/byte, while BSV\u2019s are only 0.05 sat/byte\u00b9. Given the price of $25,000/BTC vs. $45/BSV as of today, minting the same NFT is >100,000X cheaper! Data size: BSV has restored the full Script after the Genesis upgrade, so the same envelope works. It also has more ways to embed the data in a transaction. For example, OP_RETURN can be used in a spendable output. Currently, up to 50MB of data can be included in a single transaction, 12.5X bigger than the 4MB limit on BTC. Here is a transaction of 27MB and another of 12MB. Data limit is expected to increase continuously as usage grows. More advanced NFT protocol on top has already stored NFT over 1GB, by breaking it up across multiple transactions.\n\nWe are thrilled to announce that in partnership with STAS and @Bitstocks_, we have minted the largest #NFT ever on a public blockchain. At 1.07 GB in size, this single NFT is ~1/300th the size of the #BTC blockchain. Relysia Infrastructure \u2013 It's time to upgrade! #BSV pic.twitter.com/0vAE3OziCF \u2014 Relysia (@Relysia_SV) October 7, 2021\n\nBSV does so without changing the protocol. No SegWit and Taproot is needed.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://docs.ordinals.com/\n\n[2] https://medium.com/coinmonks/ordinals-an-overview-of-bitcoin-nfts-795c39447e23\n\n[3] https://tara-annison.medium.com/a-comprehensive-explanation-of-ordinals-nfts-on-bitcoin-67b11868e74f\n\n[4] https://www.chain.com/blog/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals\n\n***\n\nNOTE:\n\n[1] We compare the average fee rate.

World heavyweight champion Tyson Fury\u2019s half-brother Tommy Fury defeated Paul in the eight-round fight by split decision despite being knocked out in the final bout.\n\nDon\u2019t judge me by my wins, judge me by my losses.

Drake placed the bet on the crypto gambling platform Stake.\n\nPaul made light of Drake\u2019s bet during the press conference that followed the fight saying \u201cF***! This is Drake\u2019s fault! Drake, bro, why did you do this to me? No, it\u2019s my fault. $400,000 is nothing to him \u2013 he has won a lot more money betting on me before. He\u2019s probably about even now. Sorry, Drake, I\u2019ll get that win in the rematch.\u201d\n\nDrake is known for placing various crypto bets. Last May, Drake lost more than $200,000 worth of bitcoin on a Spanish Grand Prix bet.

        "content": "Brighton, UK, Feb. 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Moonbird NFTs attracted nearly $500 million in sales last April. Users now will have a chance to enter the promising Birds NFT collection on Bitcoin via the recently introduced Ordinals protocol.\n\n\n\nAfter a meteoric rise in popularity, the BAYC monkeys have solidified themselves as one of the top-selling NFT collections, with a whopping value of $1.3M. The descendant of the final collection of NFTs has now been released on the Bitcoin blockchain, drawing lots of attention from the NFT enthusiasts worldwide.\n\n\n\nThe Birds NFT collection is about to pick up the trend, dropping their collection onto the Bitcoin\u2019s NFT Ordinals Protocol with a $200,000 prize for one of the participants. Birds BTC is a collection of unique utility-enabled PFPs that feature a rich, diverse and unique pool of rarity-powered traits on the Ordinals protocol. The collection is bound to live up to its global name and maintain its unchallenged leadership in the NFT \"PFP\" space, spinning off as Bitcoin NFTs.\n\n\n\nConsisting of 10,000 PFPs, the collection comes with a special set of rare traits available on Ordinals. With design elements comparable to projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks, it's no surprise this Bitcoin-based series has sparked excitement in the entire NFT space.\n\n\n\nThe world of Bitcoin and NFTs is getting more interesting by the minute. The demand for a reunion with the \u201croot of all blockchains\u201d has sent its growth skyrocketing, proving this could be another sign pointing towards the bull market. The Ordinals protocol has been shaking up the crypto marketplace ever since making its debut in 2014. However, it was only two weeks ago that things truly started to heat up when NFTs found their way onto Bitcoin's blockchain thanks to the nifty code updates of SegWit and Taproot. Adding even more fuel to the fire, Ordinals recently made headlines again as they debuted a collection called 'Ordinal Punks,' taking inspiration from CryptoPunks' iconic designs.\n\nThe Birds NFT collection is the next to join the fast-growing Bitcoin NFT boom. Since the Moonbirds launch on April 16th, 2022 on Ethereum, it has already raked in a whopping $500 million from the buyers, with an impressive first 48 hours being bolstered by over $200 million alone. Ethereum put up quite a fight, but now bets are firmly placed against them as speculators make bold predictions of even greater success for its Bitcoin \u201cspin-offs\u201d down the line.\n\nWith record revenues and CryptoSlam placing this project second only to their bestselling counterpart, it's not a surprise that its titanic popularity has attracted some high-profile fans such as Beeple, Tim Ferriss, Garry Vee and Alex Ohanian, among many others. Its 10k utility-enabled PFP tokens provide additional value along with unique mint features, making sure that the Moonbirds stay flying high. After the first 500 Bird NFTs are purchased, $5,000 will be split among 32 purchasers. Once the 10,000 Bird NFTs are sold out, $200,000 will be awarded to a random purchaser. Purchasing more than 10 Bird NFTs in one transaction applies a discount of 5 up to 20%.\n\nHead over to moonbirdsbtc.com on February 28th at 12:00 UTC and get your hands on a unique Birds NFT on the thriving Bitcoin for only 0.008 BTC.\n\nFollow them on Twitter, Telegram and Discord\n\n"

        "title": "Bitcoin bull run on the horizon? Experts analyse surge past $25k in 2023 - Moneycontrol",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest digital currency, surged last week, breaking past the $25,000 mark and reaching a new high for 2023. This was an almost 60 percent gain for the cryptocurrency from the low of $15,742 in 2022 following the FTX crisis in November. Bitcoin's value has been increasing steadily since then.\n\nThe last time Bitcoin was at a similar level was in mid-June of 2022, after which it stagnated for a prolonged period, with values hovering in the $19,000 to $21,000 range for several months. The cryptocurrency is still well below its peak of $68,992, which it reached in November 2021.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nExperts said that while the surge above $25,000 was a positive sign, the market remains susceptible to sudden changes. They advise investors to remain vigilant and prepared to react quickly to market movements.\n\nAccording to Ben Sharon, cofounder of LumiShare SRG, factors such as regulatory changes, geopolitical tensions, and the performance of major players like Bitcoin will all have an impact on the market, which looks positive at this stage. \u201cThe bull market will begin within the next two quarters,\u201d Sharon told Moneycontrol.\n\nAlso Read: Top Cryptocurrency Prices Today February 27: Bitcoin, Ether in green as crypto mcap rises\n\nMatter of regulation\n\nAnother market analyst said Bitcoin is still largely misunderstood or misrepresented and the real question for investors is how regulatory authorities treat the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nNathan Thompson, a lead tech writer at Bybit, noted that Bitcoin is currently traded as a risk asset and is affected by many macro factors. These include inflation, recession, and general discourse, which have a direct impact on the price of cryptocurrency.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThompson emphasised that Bitcoin and other blockchain-based assets are a net gain in terms of access and efficiency and if allowed to flourish, they will increase productivity and growth worldwide. Sean K. August, CEO of The August Wealth Management Group, said crossing the $25,000 mark is a significant milestone for Bitcoin, which could potentially continue to rise in the short term.\n\nHowever, the future of Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, may depend on factors such as the adoption of the Ethereum blockchain and the launch of new projects and applications.\n\nAugust said the crypto market is highly volatile and subject to fluctuations, influenced by factors such as regulatory changes, adoption by institutional investors, and the macroeconomic environment. Modulus CEO Richard Gardner notes that the macroeconomy is only moving the market for the short term, and the real question for Bitcoin investors is how regulatory authorities will treat crypto.\n\nUntil there is regulation, the sector will be stuck in a holding pattern. Gardner predicts that crypto will truly break free in a meaningful way only when regulatory authorities provide oversight.\n\nIntergovernmental blockchain expert Anndy Lian said the recent surge in BTC price cannot be attributed solely to its intrinsic value \u2013 it is also heavily influenced by the current global economic climate. Bitcoin is viewed as a safe haven asset and its decentralised nature makes it an attractive option for those who are sceptical of traditional financial institutions.\n\nWhitney Setiawan, a research analyst at cryptocurrency exchange Bitrue, has predicted that the current market for Bitcoin and Ethereum could signal the start of a bull run in the near future. According to Setiawan, the crypto market is influenced by factors such as inflation slowing globally and the US Federal Reserve taking a slightly dovish tone.\n\nSetiawan cited the bottoming of crypto prices and the buy-on-the-dip mentality of traders as the main drivers for the recent price surge. Setiawan noted that historically, bear market rallies with a parabolic upward movement are quite common before a substantial decrease in price, and this could be the case this time as well."

Mr Lewis spoke out over a Bitcoin scam as he dialled in via video link.\n\nMr Lewis was called by a caller who has lost \u00a312k to a fake Bitcoin advert. Mr Lewis, addressing Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, was left fuming at the callous scammers.\n\nMartin said: \"Every time I hear a story like that, it makes me fell slightly sick If I'm honest with you.\" He added:\"It is very difficult, there are push payment regulations now and scam regulations that means maybe the bank will be able to recoup the money from the scammers bank.

        "title": "DeFi on Bitcoin Explained | How Does It Work? Beginner's Guide - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "This guide will delve into DeFi on Bitcoin, explaining what DeFi is and how it has been applied to the Bitcoin network, as well as consider some challenges inherent within this nascent ecosystem. Additionally, we highlight notable projects within this space and consider their advantages over others created on rival blockchains.\n\nWhat is DeFi?\n\nDefinition Decentralized Finance, or DeFi for short, refers to financial tools and products designed to revolutionize and replace traditional forms of banking that dictate how one accesses services such as loans and savings. DeFi aims to make finance accessible to anyone and everyone without the help of intermediaries such as banks.\n\nDeFi is more dominant on the Ethereum (ETH) network, a leading smart contract platform and the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization. Ethereum has benefited from a first-mover advantage in this field, being the first public network to support decentralized apps (dApps) since 2015.\n\nHowever, it is increasingly facing stiff competition from newer blockchains, including Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA), and Polkadot (DOT). Often overlooked in this conversation is Bitcoin, the flagship blockchain network designed to enable peer-to-peer online transactions.\n\nRecently, however, developers on the Bitcoin network have found ways to expand its capabilities beyond payments, and it is now possible to launch DeFi applications native to the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nWhat is DeFi on Bitcoin?\n\nDeFi on Bitcoin is a feature that was introduced in November 2021 thanks to the successful implementation of the Taproot upgrade, which enabled greater functionality with regard to complex scripting. With Taproot, Bitcoin coud now support decentralized apps, making it a viable alternative to Ethereum for developers looking to launch dApps.\n\nBefore the launch of DeFi apps on the Bitcoin network, BTC holders were able to convert their holdings into wrapped versions on other blockchains. The most popular was the Wrapped BTC (wBTC) asset on the Ethereum network (ERC-20 token).\n\nwBTC enabled BTC holders to participate in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols by locking their assets in a smart contract and receiving an equal amount (i.e., 1:1 ratio) in the derivative asset, which could then be used to save, lend, and earn passive income through yield farming on these platforms.\n\nHowever, since the launch of the DeFi on Bitcoin, conversions to other assets become unnecessary, and BTC coins can be used natively on these Bitcoin-based DeFi platforms.\n\nHow DeFi on Bitcoin works\n\nThe most popular way DeFi works with Bitcoin is to use a wrapped version of BTC on a non-Bitcoin blockchain. With wBTC, an investor will send BTC coins to a custodian who stores these tokens and issues wBTC in return at the same ratio.\n\nFor instance, if you send 1 BTC, you receive 1 wBTC in return. The wrapped tokens can be used on Ethereum-based DeFi protocols such as Curve (CRV), Balancer (BAL), or AAVE (AAVE).\n\nTo redeem your BTC, you send back your wBTC tokens, and the custodian (smart contract) will refund your coins to you.\n\nWith the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade launch, DeFi is now possible on Bitcoin but with a caveat. The native Bitcoin blockchain, which still uses the limited Script programming language, does not support smart contracts. Taproot helped introduce the advanced capabilities which can only be realized on layer-2 scaling solutions and sidechains.\n\nThe side chains and layer-2 protocols host dApps in various markets, including DeFi, non-fungible tokens, and gamefi ecosystems, among others.\n\nWhy do we need DeFi on Bitcoin?\n\nSo far, the flagship cryptocurrency is used mainly as a store of value and, to some extent, as a payment method. By accommodating DeFi, Bitcoin increases its utility while becoming attractive to a wider audience of users.\n\nDecentralized finance, on the other hand, needs the security and assurance that Bitcoin enjoys and that most DeFi investors and users value. Every so often, a DeFi protocol loses user funds to hackers leading to a loss of trust.\n\nDeFi on Bitcoin solves these issues and increases the trustworthiness of various solutions, thereby making them more attractive to potential developers and investors.\n\nChallenges facing DeFi on Bitcoin\n\nDeFi on Bitcoin faces three main challenges, which are:\n\nScalability; Compatibility; Security.\n\nThese challenges might not be unique to Bitcoin, but here is how they affect it.\n\nScalability\n\nBlockchain scalability measures how many transactions a decentralized network can process in a specified period, typically one second. The higher the transaction count, the higher the throughput, and vice versa.\n\nBitcoin is one of the slowest blockchains currently in the market, as it\u2019s able to process about seven transactions every second (7 TPS). In comparison, Ethereum can handle about 12-15 TPS, while Cardano and Polkadot can manage as many as 1,000 TPS.\n\nNote The TPS figures referred to above are used to show a network\u2019s capacity. It does not necessarily mean that these networks have achieved these figures in actual daily usage (if ever). The figures are often based on test results to show the capability of a given protocol.\n\nScalability is a major consideration for developers looking for a host network for their DeFi platform, and Bitcoin\u2019s figures do not stack up well against the competition.\n\nComposability\n\nComposability is a system design principle that defines the inter-relations between various modular components. A highly composable system means that its various components can be assembled in multiple combinations to form several different creations.\n\nIn its current implementation, Bitcoin is not very composable due to its use of a limited scripting language. This contrasts with its rivals, such as Ethereum, which are designed from the ground up to be composable.\n\nAs a result, DeFi developers have the propensity to lean toward Bitcoin\u2019s rivals as their protocols of choice to launch their apps. It is much easier to develop on these protocols because they have access to a wide range of assets that are easily compatible, free to use, and comply with various internal coding standards.\n\nSecurity\n\nBitcoin is, arguably, the most secure blockchain in the market currently, and it has stood the test of time. However, it is worth considering how secure the sidechains and layer-2 chains are, given that they are so few with little history if any.\n\nEven though these second-layer blockchains rely on Bitcoin\u2019s proven security infrastructure, they still pose a security risk similar to that other dApps, and dApp platforms face on Bitcoin\u2019s rival networks. Smart contract vulnerability is a major risk that every investor and developer has to consider before interacting with one.\n\nMost of the DeFi platforms and apps on the Bitcoin network are relatively recent, meaning that they are yet to be thoroughly tested, iterated, and improved upon to ensure the security of assets under management.\n\n3 Innovative Bitcoin DeFi Solutions\n\nHere are three notable companies building DeFi on Bitcoin solutions for the masses:\n\nMintlayer; Stacks; Rootstock.\n\nLet\u2019s consider each project in further detail.\n\n1. Mintlayer: Making DeFi with Bitcoin a Reality\n\nMintlayer is a Bitcoin layer-2 scalability solution with support for smart contracts, including DeFi, NFT, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and more. Think of it as an Ethereum rival with Bitcoin\u2019s security.\n\nMintlayer homepage\n\nCreated in 2019, Mintlayer is designed to offer a sustainable infrastructure to support DeFi development and deployment on both the Bitcoin and Lightning Networks. The latter is a layer-2 payment protocol looking to support micro-payments on the flagship blockchain.\n\nSimilar to Ethereum, Mintlayer is a platform on which developers can launch their dApps, thereby unlocking and extending Bitcoin\u2019s full potential. This way, it solves all three challenges facing DeFi on Bitcoin.\n\nMintlayer seeks to empower blockchain developers through four key programs, which are:\n\nEcosystem fund \u2013 enabling project creators to access funding from VCs to create solutions within the Bitcoin ecosystem;\n\n\u2013 enabling project creators to access funding from VCs to create solutions within the Bitcoin ecosystem; Incubator program \u2013 designed to nurture early-stage teams and projects to increase their chances of achieving success;\n\n\u2013 designed to nurture early-stage teams and projects to increase their chances of achieving success; Accelerator program \u2013 targeting already established projects seeking to reach higher levels in terms of adoption by porting over from other platforms such as Ethereum to Mintlayer;\n\n\u2013 targeting already established projects seeking to reach higher levels in terms of adoption by porting over from other platforms such as Ethereum to Mintlayer; Grants \u2013 designed to offer compensation to open-source developers to create or incentivize the creation of Mintlayer solutions.\n\nMintlayer is not only looking to extend Bitcoin\u2019s functionality, it is also paving the way for other developers to create and launch innovative solutions to enhance its utility further.\n\n2. Stacks.co\n\nStacks.co is an independent, smart contract blockchain linked to Bitcoin through a novel consensus mechanism dubbed Proof of Transfer (PoX). The PoX mechanism enables it to settle its transactions to the more secure Bitcoin blockchain. It is, therefore, not a layer-2 blockchain.\n\nStacks blockchain website\n\nAs a smart contract platform, Stacks offers the following features:\n\nBitcoin NFTs and their marketplaces with support for micropayments through the Lightning network;\n\nBlockchain naming system similar to Ethereum\u2019s ENS;\n\nCommunity support through the accelerator and grant programs;\n\nA native token, STX, can be staked for passive income and fee payment.\n\nStacks is extending Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities, but so far, to a lesser and limited extent compared to Mintlayer.\n\n3. RSK \u2013 Rootstock\n\nRootstock (RSK) is another independent Bitcoin sidechain with smart contract capability similar to Mintlayer and Stacks. It was created in 2017 to enhance Bitcoin\u2019s feature set by enabling dApp support.\n\nRootstock homepage\n\nA unique feature of RSK is that it uses the same Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism as Bitcoin with the same algorithm enabling community members to engage in merged mining.\n\nIn this kind of mining, one computer can be used to validate transactions in two different blockchains concurrently. As a result, RSK is theoretically as secure as Bitcoin since it shares the same hash rate.\n\nFeatures offered by the RSK blockchain include:\n\nCompatibility with Ethereum dApps;\n\nProvides a native token dubbed RBTC for fee payment, staking, and value transfer;\n\nFaster block generation times of sub-thirty seconds compared to Bitcoin\u2019s ten minutes.\n\nSupport for DeFi dApps enabling users to borrow, lend, trade, and do more with their assets.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThere is a growing demand for DeFi on Bitcoin as more people appreciate the need for secure cryptocurrency investments over potential high yields. Bitcoin is not only the most secure open network but also one of the most well-known and trusted. As a result, it is becoming more attractive to DeFi developers and investors looking.\n\nInnovative projects such as Mintlayer, Stacks, and Rootstock provide further incentives for the right people to join and help create the next DeFi ecosystem. Not only that, but they are also helping extend the Bitcoin capability beyond its initial payments and store of value utility.\n\nHowever, as the Bitcoin DeFi space grows, whether it will be popular enough to displace Ethereum as the go-to dApp deployment platform remains to be seen.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative. When investing in crypto, your capital is at risk.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about DeFi on Bitcoin\n\nWhat is DeFi on Bitcoin? DeFi is an umbrella term that refers to various financial tools and products available on decentralized networks (in this case, Bitcoin), enabling people to stake, borrow, lend, and earn passive income.\n\nWhat are some of the challenges facing Bitcoin DeFi? The three main challenges that DeFi on Bitcoin faces are scalability, composability, and security.\n\nWhy do we need DeFi on Bitcoin? Bitcoin and DeFi need each other. Bitcoin needs DeFi to attract more users and therefore gain further adoption. On the other hand, DeFi needs a more secure alternative to the current crop of smart contract platforms, thereby eliciting trust and attracting more investors."
