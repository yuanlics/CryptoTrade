        "title": "The Ultimate Guide to Bitcoin Loan: How It Works and Its Benefits - The Arizona Republic",
        "content": "Jon Stojan\n\nContributor\n\nIn recent years, the digital financial market has revolutionized the world of finance. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have been crucial in this transformation as they have emerged as new financial instruments in the mainstream market. The popularity of Bitcoin is justified by the endless opportunities it has provided traders and investors. One such innovation is the Bitcoin loan, which is creating a lot of buzz in the financial market. This guide delves into the intricacies of Bitcoin loans, decoding its mechanics and benefits to determine the reason behind its growing acceptance.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with a brief introduction to Bitcoin loans and their role. A Bitcoin loan is an amazing opportunity to turn your Bitcoin holdings as collateral for securing a loan in fiat currency or another cryptocurrency. This can be of immense help if you need funds but don't want to sell your holdings because you expect higher returns in the future. It is like using your digital assets to increase your purchasing power without losing your digital assets.\n\nSecuring Bitcoin loans\n\nTo secure a loan, you only need to send your Bitcoin to a lending platform as collateral. In return, you will receive a loan in stablecoin or another cryptocurrency based on the value of your Bitcoin holdings and the platform's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. The LTV ratio is a measure of risk factors associated with the volatility of the crypto market. If the value of Bitcoin drops, you might have to add more collateral to equalize the amount you borrowed or risk your Bitcoin holdings being liquidated.\n\nBenefits of Bitcoin loans\n\nThe benefits of Bitcoin loans have fuelled its popularity in the market. The opportunity to access liquidity without selling off your holding stands as the first merit of these loans. This is a great advantage for long-term holders who believe in the prospects of Bitcoin. By preserving your Bitcoin holdings, you not only save on capital gains tax but also borrow against it.\n\nCompared to traditional financial institutions, the level of privacy in Bitcoin loans is higher. Unlike extensive personal information and credit checks required by banks and other lending institutions, you can secure a Bitcoin loan with minimal identity verification. This is why Bitcoin loans are becoming the preferred option among individuals who value their financial privacy. It is also noteworthy that Bitcoin loans are processed faster than traditional loans and often involve prolonged application processes and bureaucratic delays. Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, you can get a Bitcoin loan within hours or even minutes.\n\nRisks with Bitcoin loans\n\nJust like any other financial tool, Bitcoin loans have their own limitations and challenges. The most common one is the inherent volatility of the crypto market. You are at risk of liquidation of your Bitcoin holdings or collateral if the value of Bitcoin falls to a certain range. This risk can be mitigated by tracking the market value of Bitcoin and adding up to the collateral in a bearish market situation.\n\nThis high volatility of Bitcoin can also be profitable for Bitcoin loans if the currency value rises. You can benefit from both the loan and the increasing value of your collateral if you have an outstanding Bitcoin loan while the value of your Bitcoin holdings increases. Investors often capitalize upon these opportunities.\n\nAs the financial landscape continues to evolve, Bitcoin loans are emerging as more feasible and seamless options to secure loans. This financial tool is not just closing the gap between digital and physical financial realms but also changing how people benefit from their digital holding. With incredible flexibility, speed, and privacy, Bitcoin loans are solidifying the path for Cryptocurrencies to integrate into the mainstream financial market."

        "content": "Today Nomura\u2019s digital assets subsidiary Laser Digital unveiled its Bitcoin Adoption Fund targeting institutional investors. It\u2019s a Cayman Islands long-only mutual fund with the digital asset custody secured by Komainu.\n\nNomura cofounded Komainu as a regulated custodian in 2018 alongside tech security firm Ledger and asset manager Coinshares.\n\n\u201cTechnology is a key driver of global economic growth and is transforming a large part of the economy from analogue to digital,\u201d said Sebastien Guglietta, Head of Laser Digital Asset Management. \u201cBitcoin is one of the enablers of this long-lasting transformational change.\u201d\n\nGuglietta who leads the fund, was formerly Chief Scientist at Nomura. Before that he held the same role at Brevan Howard as well as portfolio manager.\n\nAsset management is the second part of Laser Digital\u2019s strategy. It launched with a venture capital fund, which has invested across web3, especially DeFi. The third arm will be digital asset trading. It\u2019s no coincidence that it bought elysium, a post trade solution for FX and digital assets.\n\nInstitutional Bitcoin funds\n\nThe crypto community is eagerly awaiting the first U.S. authorization of a Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF). While that might encourage consumer adoption in the U.S., exchange traded products have already been available elsewhere. One example is the Coinshares Physical Crypto ETP.\n\nHowever, institutions have also been able to get exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding crypto. Several large banks, including Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan partnered with crypto specialist asset managers NYDIG and Galaxy Digital. NYDIG has several funds with more than $750 million (January) in assets under management just in its NYDIG Institutional Bitcoin Fund. Last year BlackRock launched a Bitcoin investment trust.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the notorious Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which reached a discount to net asset value price of almost 50% at the start of the year. Although it recently recovered to a deficit of \u201cjust\u201d 20% after winning an SEC lawsuit."

        "title": "Sub-Saharan Africa Crypto Adoption Trends and Analysis - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "This post is an excerpt from our 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report. Download your copy now!\n\nSimilar to previous years, Sub-Saharan Africa has the smallest crypto economy of all regions, accounting for 2.3% of global transaction volume between July 2022 and June 2023. During that time period, the region received an estimated $117.1 billion in on-chain value.\n\nAcross the entire region during the time period studied, centralized exchanges are the most-used platform type, facilitating over half of all transaction volume. Sub-Saharan\u2019s cryptocurrency market also appears more retail-driven than most, with a larger share of transaction volume coming in transactions under $1 million in value compared to most other regions.\n\nAlthough Sub-Saharan Africa has consistently been one of the smallest cryptocurrency markets, a closer analysis reveals that crypto has penetrated key markets and become an important part of many residents\u2019 day-to-day lives. As we\u2019ll explore in more detail later, no country exemplifies this better than Nigeria, which ranks second overall on our Global Crypto Adoption Index and also leads the region in raw transaction volume.\n\nOther countries in the region ranking high on the index include Kenya (21), Ghana (29), and South Africa (31). Keep reading to learn what drives crypto adoption in Sub-Saharan Africa and learn how recent regulatory developments have impacted local markets.\n\nCitizens flock to Bitcoin and stablecoins to protect against inflation and debt\n\nIn no region is Bitcoin more dominant than Sub-Saharan Africa, as the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency makes up a bigger share of transaction volume there than in any other region.\n\nWhy the disproportionate uptake of Bitcoin? It may be that Sub-Saharan Africa residents are turning to so-called digital gold for an alternative store of value. Many countries in the region have struggled with rising inflation and debt, making cryptocurrency an attractive means of storing value, preserving savings, and attaining greater financial freedom. In Ghana, for instance, inflation reached 29.8% in June 2022 after 13 consecutive months of increases \u2014 that marks its highest level in two decades. With relatively few financial opportunities, many Ghanians have turned to Bitcoin. Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa have all faced similar problems in recent years, and all show a great deal of grassroots cryptocurrency adoption \u2014 that\u2019s probably no coincidence.\n\nHowever, experts on the ground tell us that some market participants have turned away from Bitcoin and towards stablecoins of late, as these generally see less price volatility than Bitcoin, whose price is well off all-time highs. Moyo Sodipo, Co-Founder and CPO of Nigeria-based cryptocurrency exchange Busha, provided some insight into this activity, stating, \u201cWhen Busha gained popularity around 2019 and 2020, there was a big frenzy for Bitcoin. A lot of people were not initially keen on stablecoins. Now that Bitcoin has lost a lot of its value, there is a desire for diversification between Bitcoin and stablecoins. However, market shifts aren\u2019t dampening activity. People are constantly looking for opportunities to hedge against the devaluation of the Naira and the persistent economic decline since COVID.\u201d\n\nSpotlight: Nigeria is Africa\u2019s top crypto economy\n\nNigeria boasts the largest population and economy in Sub-Saharan Africa, and as discussed above, the largest cryptocurrency economy as well. Perhaps even more notable is that Nigeria\u2019s crypto economy continues to grow despite market turmoil. In fact, Nigeria is one of only six countries in the top 50 by size globally whose crypto transaction volume grew year-over-year in the time period we studied. Its growth rate of 9.0% places it third among those six.\n\nThe evidence suggests crypto is one solution to Nigeria\u2019s economic challenges. Since 2016, Nigeria has suffered from two major recessions, fueled by an unstable political situation, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the collapse of oil prices. Consequently, Nigerians of all ages are facing high unemployment \u2014 more than 20 million people were looking for jobs in 2021 \u2014 and many are up and moving to other countries.\n\nThe recent Naira crisis has exacerbated these issues. In 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria announced its intentions to redesign the Naira and issue new notes in order to combat inflation and counterfeiting, as well as take more control over how much currency is circulating.\n\nUnfortunately, the resulting cash shortage placed enormous pressure on the country\u2019s unbanked population and triggered uncertainty regarding the use of old notes \u2014 all during an election period and a record high inflation rate of more than 20% at the beginning of 2023. Nigeria\u2019s uncertain economic climate has encouraged many citizens to seek financial alternatives, increasing the value proposition of cryptocurrency.\n\nThese dynamics are reflected in the data. On the chart below, we can see that interest in Bitcoin and stablecoins has generally risen as the Naira\u2019s value has decreased, particularly during the most recent extremely steep drops in June and July of 2023. The higher spikes around May and November of 2022, however, were likely driven more by users seeking to trade on the volatility spurred by TerraLuna and FTX\u2019s collapses respectively, as opposed to the local economic situation.\n\nAt the same time, interest in altcoins has been growing across the region lately. Moyo Sodipo explained, \u201cOn days when the market tanks, we\u2019ve also seen a buying frenzy. It depends on the dynamics of the market at that point in time. When there is a new memecoin, like Dogecoin or Shiba, there has also been a buying frenzy. Someone is always going to be interested in a token that seems like it could make you the next couple thousand dollars.\u201d The below chart illustrates this increase in altcoin activity, as well as the proportionally large percentage of monthly stablecoin value.\n\nRegulatory developments throughout Sub-Saharan Africa open the door to more crypto growth\n\nRegulation has also brought activity to exchanges in Sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa in particular has been one of the region\u2019s leaders in terms of crypto regulation and the development of supportive trading frameworks. At the end of 2022, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) announced a licensing regime for cryptocurrency businesses and declared that crypto assets are financial products, lending them greater legal clarity, and also empowering financial investigators to better fight illicit activity in the space.\n\nThe country\u2019s proactive approach to regulation has removed a lot of regulatory uncertainty and thus encouraged trading of both established and emerging digital tokens. In fact, citizens of the country have traded billions of dollars worth of digital currency in recent years. According to Marius Reitz, General Manager Africa at South Africa-based exchange Luno, \u201cPresently, the predominant use case for crypto in South Africa revolves around investment. Over the last 3 years, the number of customers holding a meaningful crypto balance on Luno has increased by almost 50%.\u201d He added, \u201cIn markets with no regulatory bans, we tend to see the industry develop more responsibly as the market operates above the ground, with more productive interaction between regulators and exchanges. But bans aren\u2019t stopping people from wanting crypto. The crypto industry will continue to grow with or without regulation. It is just in everyone\u2019s interest that there is some pragmatic regulation in place that protects consumers and creates a safer operating environment for all.\u201d\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has also been navigating the crypto landscape, issuing statements on potential volatility risks at the same time as leaders consider the implementation of a CBDC. At the beginning of 2023, the government proposed a bill advocating for a consistent securities definition of digital currencies and diligent recordkeeping by licensed crypto traders. Around the same time, the Nigerian government approved a national blockchain policy, highlighting ways blockchain adoption can benefit the country and paving the way for future legal framework.\n\nIn Mauritius, which is slightly behind Kenya in terms of raw cryptocurrency transaction volume, the Virtual Assets and Initial Token Offering Services Act of 2021 has provided comprehensive legislation for new token issuance. The country\u2019s sustained dedication toward protecting consumers has helped promote crypto adoption and attracted traders while other countries in the region have issued explicit or implicit bans on certain crypto-related activities.\n\nThe increased regulatory clarity provided by the flurry of recent legislation may be helping Africa\u2019s local cryptocurrency industry. As discussed above, many of the most important crypto regulations enacted by Africa\u2019s biggest countries came around early 2023. Check out the chart below, which compares relative growth in Sub-Saharan usage of local, homegrown crypto exchanges vs. international exchanges.\n\nThe consumer safety afforded by better regulations, the confidence those regulations give consumers, and local crypto businesses\u2019 ability to comply with those regulations may be part of why local African exchanges have been outpacing international competitors on growth within the region since early 2023.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s crypto economy?\n\nThe future of cryptocurrency in Sub-Saharan Africa looks bright, with large countries like Nigeria already taking their place as global leaders in crypto adoption. Increasing regulatory clarity throughout the region also appears to be bolstering growth, which local crypto operators appear primed to take advantage of. The key lesson though is the same we\u2019ve gotten from studying emerging markets over the years: While residents of wealthier nations may have buy and sell more cryptocurrency than those of emerging markets, the latter has a greater day-to-day need for cryptocurrency, very much in line with the original vision for Bitcoin and the sector at large.\n\nThis material is for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide legal, tax, financial, or investment advice.

        "title": "Better Buy: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite recent volatility in the crypto markets, Bitcoin (BTC -1.17%) and Ethereum (ETH -1.64%) remain two of the best-performing large-market-cap cryptos. For the year, Bitcoin is now up 65% while Ethereum is up 40%.\n\nBased on recent performance, Bitcoin would seem to be the obvious better buy. But just remember -- past performance is no guarantee of future performance. If you are a long-term investor, you need to keep your eye on future developments as well. With that in mind, there are three key factors that could determine which crypto is the better buy over the long haul.\n\nFlow of institutional money\n\nThe most important factor remains the flow of institutional money into the crypto asset class. Currently, Bitcoin appears to have a massive edge over Ethereum, with many institutional investors viewing it as a \"safe haven\" asset that can protect them from volatility in the broader market. We saw this scenario play itself out earlier this year, when a regional banking crisis in the U.S. immediately led to a flow of new money into Bitcoin, which in turn led to rapid price gains.\n\nMoreover, this entire summer seemed to be dominated by one single topic: the launch of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF. This led to a mini-rally for Bitcoin in mid-June, as investors recalibrated what it could mean for institutional investor flows into crypto if the SEC finally signs off on a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHere, too, Bitcoin seems to have the edge over Ethereum, since there seems to be much more investor appetite for a spot Bitcoin ETF than a spot Ethereum ETF. As long as that remains the case, there will likely be more institutional money flowing into Bitcoin than Ethereum.\n\nUser adoption rates\n\nThe next major factor to keep in mind is user adoption rates. The big-picture view here is that, as both Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to go mainstream, they will both likely see a massive surge in their built-in user bases. So which blockchain is set to grow at a faster pace in coming years?\n\nFor Bitcoin, some of the best user adoption rate numbers come from Cathie Wood and Ark Invest, which released a research report this year with a set of scenarios to describe how Bitcoin usage will increase between now and the year 2030. In a base-case scenario, for example, Bitcoin could soon account for 3% of the M2 money supply of emerging market nations, 10% of the remittance asset market, and 2.5% of all institutional assets. Over time, these percentages could grow even higher, as Bitcoin increasingly goes mainstream around the world.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, the best user adoption rate numbers typically come from valuation models based on Metcalfe's Law, which states that the value of any network is directly proportional to the square of the number of users on it. This law has been used to model the valuation of telecom and internet companies, and now it is being used to model the valuation of cryptocurrencies. Thus, it's very possible that Ethereum's future valuation could be quadratic, not linear, in nature as more users are added to its ecosystem.\n\nThe easiest place to see the impact of this growth happening is in the Layer 2 space, which describes all of the blockchains that are building directly on top of the main Ethereum blockchain. By some accounts, Ethereum's total market capitalization should be $250 billion right now, not $200 billion, if you calculate all of the extra user activity that is happening on Layer 2 blockchain networks. In short, Ethereum could be undervalued by as much as 25% right now.\n\nTechnological improvements\n\nIf there's one area where Ethereum has a decided edge, it's in the technology supporting its blockchain. Whereas Bitcoin is built on old, proof-of-work technology that requires expensive, energy-intensive mining, Ethereum recently transitioned to new, proof-of-stake technology that does not require mining at all. As soon as Ethereum pulled off The Merge last year, it immediately became 99.9% more energy-efficient.\n\nAnd Ethereum is hardly resting on its laurels. As founder Vitalik Buterin has pointed out, Ethereum still has at least five new cycles of technological improvement incoming, all of which will finally lead to the creation of a super-fast, super-efficient \"Ethereum 2.0.\" When that happens, Ethereum will become one of the fastest, most secure transaction networks in the world.\n\nAnd the winner is...\n\nCrypto investors for years have been looking forward to \"the flippening\" -- the moment in time when Ethereum finally overtakes (i.e., \"flips\") Bitcoin as the most valuable crypto in the world. For that to happen, Ethereum's future growth needs to outpace Bitcoin's future growth by a significant margin.\n\nBased on the above, it's possible to see such a scenario taking place. But for now, I'm sticking with Bitcoin, which currently accounts for approximately 50% of the total market value of the entire crypto market. As long as Bitcoin remains the clear favorite option of both retail and institutional investors, it's likely to outpace Ethereum as the better buy going forward."

Laser Digital said the Bitcoin Adoption Fund is the first in a range of crypto investment products the firm will launch.\n\nThe fund launched as bitcoin rose above $27,000 earlier this week for the first time since August. The world's first and largest cryptocurrency has traded rangebound in the last few months.\n\nLaser Digital Asset Management\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nLaser Digital's asset management business is led by Sebastian Guglietta, previously Nomura\u2019s chief scientist officer. Before that, he was a portfolio manager and senior scientist at Brevan Howard. Fiona King, who joined Laser earlier this year from Nickel Digital Asset Management, is head of distribution of Laser Digital Asset Management.\n\n\u201cTechnology is a key driver of global economic growth and is transforming a large part of the economy from analogue to digital. Bitcoin is one of the enablers of this long-lasting transformational change and long-term exposure to bitcoin offers a solution to investors to capture this macro trend,\" Guglietta said of the fund.\n\nLaser Digital was launched a year ago to focus on three core areas: venture capital, asset management and trading. Laser Venture Capital has already invested in over ten crypto startups to date, including Orderly Network, WebN Group and Infinity Exchange, according to The Block Pro's Deals Dashboard. In June, Laser Digital acquired Elysium Technology Group to provide post-trade solutions for over-the-counter foreign exchange and digital assets.\n\nLast month, Laser Digital's Dubai entity received operating license approval from the city's Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority. The full license will allow Laser Digital to provide crypto broker-dealer and asset management services from its Dubai entity."

        "title": "How Bitcoin miners can survive a hostile market \u2014 and the 2024 halving - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Only seven months remain before the next Bitcoin (BTC) halving in April 2024. It happens approximately every four years and is a deflationary process that cuts the production of new coins by 50%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving is a high-profile event for crypto investors and has historically led to an increase in BTC\u2019s price. However, its impact on the mining industry is a more complex issue. It reduces block rewards, one of the primary revenue streams for miners. The 2024 halving will reduce it from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. That\u2019s why miners must adapt their strategies to compensate for the reduced rewards resulting from the halving.\n\nLet\u2019s explore the strategies and alternative income sources that may help Bitcoin miners amid hostile market conditions.\n\nChanging mindsets\n\nBitcoin mining involves a competitive process where miners vie for block rewards. This competition is driven by Bitcoin\u2019s block time, which averages around 10 minutes per block on the protocol level. Whether the network\u2019s computing power is relatively low at 1 kilo hash per second or surges to a massive 200 million terra hashes per second, the same block rewards must be distributed among miners.\n\nRelated: An ETF will bring a revolution for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\n\nThis competitive environment encourages miners to prioritize energy efficiency and the use of cost-effective hardware. With each halving event, where block rewards are cut by 50%, this trend toward efficiency gains momentum. As the cost of producing a single BTC is set to approximately double shortly after the next halving, miners will need to explore ways to optimize their profitability and focus on these three critical factors.\n\nBitcoin miners\u2019 survival rests on these three whales\n\nThe first and most important \u201cwhale\u201d is the cost of electricity. Even a modest fluctuation of 1 cent per kilowatt-hour (kWh) can lead to a substantial $3,800 variance in the production cost of BTC, according to JPMorgan. To bolster their post-halving profitability, miners are exploring sophisticated contracts and contemplating relocation to countries or regions where electricity prices are lower. They even consider power generation from stranded gas options. I believe that it\u2019s crucial for miners to secure electricity rates at or below 5 cents/kWh to maintain profitability beyond April 2024.\n\nThe second major factor demanding miners\u2019 attention is the efficiency of their equipment. For instance, daily BTC mining costs can be slashed by more than 63% when upgrading from a rig with a 60 joules per terahash (J/TH) efficiency rating to one with a 22 J/TH rating. Miners boasting hardware efficiency and benefiting from lower electricity costs will be the most profitable. They are the ones most likely to weather significant market events like the upcoming halving.\n\nAdditionally, I suggest miners employ the third strategy that involves accumulating excess capital in mined BTC during profitable periods. This reserve can serve as a buffer against the impact of reduced block rewards post-halving. When the post-halving rally occurs, miners can capitalize on their reserves by selling mined assets at a higher profit margin, helping to offset the losses.\n\nWhile strategies such as securing lower electricity rates, adopting more energy-efficient mining equipment, and utilizing reserve capital can mitigate the adverse effects, the 2024 halving will bring substantial pressure on miners. It can lead to the potential closure of numerous mining operations. Thus, miners will also need to explore alternative revenue streams. One promising opportunity for miners lies in projects like Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nOther ways\n\nBitcoin Ordinals have recently garnered significant attention by driving transaction fees within the Bitcoin network to new highs. Ordinal \u201cinscriptions,\u201d the metadata attached to each satoshi, are unique assets created directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, similar to a nonfungible token (NFT). To obtain one, users typically engage with the platform or protocol responsible for Ordinals.\n\nRelated: 10 years later, still no Bitcoin ETF \u2014 but who cares?\n\nAs the number of inscriptions rises \u2014 surpassing 25.5 million as of August \u2014 so does the revenue generated from transactions, which presently stands above $53 million. This trend suggests that alternative income streams for miners may gain prominence in the long term.\n\nOrdinals shift the profitability equation for miners, increasing user demand for creating inscriptions, initiating processing transactions on the Bitcoin network and incentivizing miners to include their transactions in the next block.\n\nWe can certainly expect more developments on top of the Bitcoin network that will enable miners to adapt more effectively to the post-halving landscape. As we move closer to the halving event, miners must prioritize the aforementioned strategies to optimize their profitability and stay open to new alternatives on the horizon.\n\nDidar Bekbauov is the CEO of Bitcoin mining company Xive, which he co-founded in 2019.

        "title": "What Happens After A Spot Bitcoin ETF is Approved? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "One of the latest developments in the Bitcoin market is the potential approval of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). An ETF is a financial product that allows investors to gain exposure to an asset without having to directly own it. In the case of a Bitcoin ETF, it would provide investors with a convenient way to invest in Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. But what would happen if a Bitcoin ETF is approved? Let's dive into the potential implications and outcomes.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe Basics of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nA Bitcoin ETF would function similarly to other ETFs, in that it would be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and subject to strict reporting requirements. This would provide investors with a level of transparency and oversight that is often lacking in the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, a Bitcoin ETF would bring institutional-grade custody solutions, reducing the risk of theft or loss of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Role of ETFs in the Financial Market\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF would likely lead to increased market liquidity. As more investors enter the market through the ETF, the overall trading volume of Bitcoin would likely increase. This increased liquidity could help stabilize the price of Bitcoin and reduce volatility, making it a more attractive investment option for both retail and institutional investors.\n\nAdditionally, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could have positive implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. It would signal a greater acceptance and recognition of Bitcoin by regulatory authorities, potentially leading to increased adoption and mainstream integration of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Regulatory Hurdles\n\nRegulators have expressed concerns about the potential for market manipulation, lack of investor protection, and the possibility of fraud in the Bitcoin market. These concerns have led the SEC to reject multiple Bitcoin ETF proposals in the past.\n\nHowever, proponents of a Bitcoin ETF argue that the market has matured significantly since those rejections. They highlight the introduction of regulated exchanges, increased transparency, and the growing interest from institutional investors as signs of a more robust and regulated ecosystem.\n\nThe Current Status of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nAs of now, the SEC has not approved any Bitcoin ETFs. However, several companies have filed proposals, with some making significant progress towards approval. The industry eagerly awaits a decision from the SEC, which could have far-reaching consequences for the Bitcoin market.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF holds significant implications for the Bitcoin market and the broader financial industry. It would provide investors with a regulated and convenient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially driving increased demand and liquidity. Additionally, it could attract institutional investors, bringing stability and validation to the market. However, risks and challenges, such as market volatility and regulatory uncertainties, must be carefully considered. Only time will tell how the journey towards Bitcoin ETF approval unfolds, but the potential outcomes warrant close attention from investors and regulators alike.\n\nBitcoin Backstage with Dylan LeClair\n\nDylan\u2019s advice in a bear market\n\n\u201cJust understand what you own. You cannot borrow someone else\u2019s conviction. You need to understand what bitcoin is, where it is potentially going, think of the long term game, and stay humble and stack sats.\u201d\n\nDylan\u2019s advice to newcomers\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of work to understand what bitcoin is, but ultimately bitcoin is a savings mechanism that no one can mess with if you safely self custody your bitcoin.\u201d\n\nDylan left us off with \u201cBitcoin fixes the government monopoly on money and currency debasement.\u201d\n\nQuick Bitcoin News Recap of the Week\n\nPaxos Fat Fingered Bitcoin\n\nWhile at first it looked like PayPal overpaid by over a whopping half a million dollars, or about 19 bitcoin worth of transaction fees with on-chains analytics, it was actually Paxos that caused the error.\n\nCoinbase Integrates Lightning\n\nCoinbase announces plans to integrate the Lightning Network onto their exchange platform. CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted out saying that Bitcoin is the most important asset in cryptocurrency.\n\nCEO of Binance US Leaves Company\n\nBrian Shroder, the CEO of Binance.US, leaves the company, news that preceded 33% of the Binance workforce being laid off. It seems the pressure from the SEC lawsuit back in June is boiling up quickly.\n\nFTX Clawbacks\n\nIt was disclosed in court papers that they analyzed certain payments dished out to athletes before the company unraveled last November and found that some can be claimed through clawbacks during Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nThey want to clawback payments to athletes such as Shaquille O\u2019Neal, tennis star Naomi Osaka, and other athletes and teams that promoted FTX.\n\nPresident Nayib Bukele of El Salvador meets with the Emir of Qatar\n\nPresident Bukele and the Emir of Qatar met to discuss commercial corporations between both countries, and presumably about Bitcoin.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

We\u2019re in the depths of crypto winter. $2 trillion in value wiped out last year.\n\nToday, On Point: Tales from the world of cryptocurrency and casino capitalism.\n\nGuests\n\nZeke Faux, investigative reporter for Bloomberg Businessweek. Author of \"Number Go Up: Inside Crypto\u2019s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall.\"\n\nBook Excerpt\n\nExcerpted from Number Go Up: Inside Crypto\u2019s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall by Zeke Faux. Copyright \u00a9 2023 by Zeke Faux. Excerpted by permission of Crown Currency, an imprint of Crown Publishing, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.\n\nTranscript\n\nPart I\n\nDEBORAH BECKER: Two weeks from today, perhaps the most well-known cryptocurrency billionaire faces trial on fraud charges. It's been a spectacular fall for Sam Bankman-Fried, who was arrested 10 months ago, going from running one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX, from his $30 million Bahamas penthouse, to now sitting in a jail in Brooklyn.\n\nShortly after FTX filed for bankruptcy, Bankman-Freed said no one had been intentionally defrauded. There were just some management failures. Here's what he told George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America.\n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED: I wasn't spending any time or effort trying to manage risk on FTX. Trying, and that, that obviously --\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: That's a stunning admission.\n\nBANKMAN-FRIED: What?\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That's a pretty stunning admission.\n\nBANKMAN-FRIED: Yeah, I mean it, I don't know what to say. What happened. And if I had been, if I had been spending an hour a day thinking about risk management on FTX, I don't think that would have happened. I think I stopped working as hard for a bit. Honestly, if I look back on myself, I think I got a little cocky, maybe more than a little bit.\n\nBECKER: What Bankman-Fried banked on was the volume of people investing in crypto. Celebrity endorsements were used to try to convince people not to miss out on investing in digital currency. Celebrities like former Patriots quarterback Tom Brady urged others to use FTX, Bankman-Fried's digital exchange.\n\nHere's Brady holding a portable flamethrower in an ad for FTX.\n\nTOM BRADY: You don't need a flamethrower to buy, sell, or trade Bitcoin and crypto safely. You just need FTX.\n\nBECKER: The Justice Department is now reviewing those ads as the investigation continues into Bankman-Fried and other crypto moguls after the staggering fall of crypto with $2 trillion estimated to have been wiped out in the last year.\n\nI'm Deborah Becker, in for Magna Chakrabarti, and this is On Point. Our guest this hour has spent some time talking with Sam Bankman-Fried and dozens of others for his new book about the cryptocurrency world. He spent years talking with those who won and those who lost in the complex digital currency universe.\n\nZeke Faux is an investigative reporter with Bloomberg Businessweek. He's author of the new book titled \"Number Go Up: Inside Crypto\u2019s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall.\" Zeke Faux, welcome to On Point.\n\nZEKE FAUX: Thanks so much, Deborah.\n\nBECKER: So you wrote in your book that you had done a piece about Sam Bankman-Fried earlier when FTX was still riding high in the crypto bubble, and that may have been why he agreed to talk with you again as his arrest was imminent.\n\nExplain to us how that interview took place and tell us, who was Sam Bankman-Fried?\n\nFAUX: I was fascinated by his story from the start. What really got me was that, here was a kid that when he was in college at MIT, he was really committed to this idea he wanted to do something good for the world.\n\nAnd he met a philosopher who pitched him this idea of earning to give. He said, \"Hey, you've been handing out pamphlets for this vegan group. Anyone could do that. You're really smart. How about you get rich and then give that money away?\" And then when I met him, it's less than 10 years later. He's 29 years old.\n\nHe's one of the richest people in the world, and he's saying that he did it all out of this motive of altruism. And yet he hadn't really given very much away. So, I was really fascinated by this idea of whether he would follow through. Or whether he'd be corrupted by his quest to amass as much power and money as possible.\n\nAnd, as you said, when things were going well, I flew down, I spent a couple days with him, I wrote a profile of him that was focused on that point, and not so much about, is there a giant fraud going on? And then, cut to only a few months later, now, FTX had failed. And there were $8 billion missing. And if you're baffled by some of these cryptocurrency terms, it's really, it's not that complicated.\n\nYou can think of FTX as like an e-trade, but instead of buying Apple shares or Exxon, you're buying Bitcoin or Dogecoin, you send them your money. You buy these coins, you trade them. And then later you ask for your money back. And what had happened was that a lot of customers had asked for their money back, they'd found it wasn't there, there were $8 billion missing, it sure looked like a giant fraud had occurred, but Sam Bankman-Fried had yet to be arrested, he was holed up in his penthouse in the Bahamas, and I decided to fly down there and see his side of the story.\n\nBECKER: And what did he tell you? So what was his defense here?\n\nFAUX: So what he said was that, so what had happened was that he had this e-trade, this FTX, and then he also controlled a hedge fund called Alameda Research. And Alameda had borrowed the customer's money from FTX and then gone and gambled it away. They'd spent tons of it on like this real estate spending spree in the Bahamas.\n\nThey'd been giving tons of political donations. They'd been, and it all looked like this had come from customer money. And what Sam told me, which was just truly bizarre. First off, I walk into this this $30 million penthouse, not part of the tour on the first profile, when he was trying to paint this picture of himself as someone who's above caring about things like fancy apartments.\n\nHe famously liked to say he drove a Toyota Corolla and slept on a beanbag at his office.\n\nBECKER: And he was doing it all just to give it away.\n\nFAUX: Yes, so I walk into this penthouse, and the first thing that struck me were the shoes. There were just tons, this giant pile of shoes right at the entrance. And it was that all of these FTX employees, who had lived there, had fled the island in such haste that they left behind all their things.\n\nAnd these are like, young kids who'd moved to, mostly Americans, who'd moved to Hong Kong with him, when he was running his company there, and then to the Bahamas, and when things started to look bad, they'd fled. And some of them had, they'd been in tears, they'd moved back with their parents, it's really, imagine that. Your first job, and then it collapses just like that, it's really, it's really wild to see.\n\nAnd Sam led me into the most modest room of this fancy apartment, and just started talking and going on and on about how he just hadn't been paying attention. He had, he'd lost track. He hadn't done anything intentionally wrong. But none of it seemed very credible to me. Because here's someone who, even if you take him at his word that he was doing it all to give it all away, he's someone who dedicated his life to making a lot of money.\n\nAnd he was basically trying to tell me, \"I wasn't even paying attention to how much I had, I lost track.\" And at one point he said that he'd misplaced $8 billion. And I'm like, \"Are you really telling me you just misplaced $8 billion?\"\n\nBECKER: Billion with a B, we should say.\n\nFAUX: With a B, yeah.\n\nAnd he says to me, \"Misaccounted.\" And he almost sounded like proud of himself with this explanation, but I'm just sitting there in disbelief. I couldn't imagine that this was really the case.\n\nBECKER: And so do you think then, was any of that altruism true? Was that the truth? Did he really start this because he just wanted to amass a large amount of wealth and give it away and quote-unquote, save the world?\n\nWas any of that true and then it just got corrupted? Or what happened?\n\nFAUX: So feel free, you may think that I'm too committed to my original thesis.\n\nBECKER: (LAUGHS)\n\nFAUX: But I actually believe that I spoke with him. I spoke with people who've known him his whole life. Many of his colleagues. These people really were spending all their time thinking about effective altruism, which takes you to some weird places.\n\nThey were thinking about the risk to the world posed by out-of-control AI. Or the next pandemic, and they really thought that by directing their billions to the right causes, they could change the course of human history potentially. And this kind of hubris, I think, made them more dangerous, made them willing to take huge risks.\n\nBecause what's like a little cryptocurrency fraud if you might be able to save the world on the other end?\n\nBECKER: So did they just get corrupted then by the amount of money involved? Or did they just make really bad mistakes and take too many risks? So without getting into all of the boring crypto details, essentially at one point from what I'm told by my sources, Sam and his top lieutenants, other young people like him, they learned in the summer of 2022 that essentially their hedge fund was out of money, and it was time to call it quits. And they had a meeting and decided, \"Hey, should we just admit our failure?\n\nOr, should we dip into these customer funds, take this gamble and maybe we can keep this going.\" And if crypto keeps going up and up, no one will ever know. And from what I was told, they decided to take that gamble. And if that's true, it's a very illegal gamble. And it didn't work out. And now Sam's top lieutenants have all pleaded guilty.\n\nThey're going to be testifying against him. It's going to be a very dramatic trial to see these old friends who conquered the crypto world together. All turning against each other.\n\nBECKER: So let's explain a little bit of the basics for folks who don't understand the crypto world, myself included here.\n\nSo when we're talking about FTX as an exchange, let's explain what that is and what that means in cryptocurrency.\n\nFAUX: If you want to buy a Bitcoin, you have to somehow exchange your real dollars for that Bitcoin. And the place where you do that is called an exchange. And you could do that on a more mainstream app like a Robinhood, or you could go to FTX and it's just like a, it's a user-friendly app.\n\nThat's why they had Tom Brady and Larry David pitching it. You send them money. And then once your money is in the app, you can trade whatever cryptocurrencies you want. And then win or lose, you're going to take it out later. And like I was saying before, you would be very surprised to find the money wasn't there.\n\nYou sent this money to gamble on crypto. And once you have your winnings, you expect them to be available to take out just like at a casino. So I think of them, these crypto exchanges, just like offshore casinos, the reason it was in the Bahamas is that there's a lot of rules around investing in the U.S.\n\nIt didn't follow them, so it was based in the Bahamas where the rules are different.\n\nPart II\n\nBECKER: Zeke, it seems to me a real premise here is you've got to get a lot of people to believe in the value of this currency.\n\nSo it's value will go up. That's essentially what we're talking about, right? Is that how you would describe it?\n\nFAUX: Yeah. So if we roll back two years, when I was getting started in this world, that was the question that I had too. I was like, \"Isn't there, is there something more to this?\"\n\n'Cause I'm hearing about it all over the place. It's practically inescapable. And I didn't really, even as an investigative reporter, I didn't really want to investigate it, because I thought, \"What's to investigate?\" Oh, people just, everyone starts talking about Dogecoin, which for those who aren't educated on this, is a cryptocurrency that's based on a popular picture of a dog.\n\nAnd there's nothing more to it. You go on your Robinhood or FTX, you click buy, and you buy some Dogecoin. No one's promising it even does anything. For a couple years there, prices of Dogecoin and all these other cryptocurrencies were just going up so high that people started talking about it like this might be the future of finance.\n\nAnd I'm just sitting there being like, \"Is this all there is?\" Surely there has to be something to this. Like, all these smart people have been working on this for so many years. They must have some sort of real-world purpose. And I cut to two years later and I find that I'm talking to Sam in his apartment, and I find that in fact, this guy who had been hailed as like the crypto genius, the smartest trader in crypto, himself had totally bought into this thinking. And had made huge bets on things like totally asinine things like Dogecoin or that his supposed giant wealth, a lot of it consisted of stockpiles of totally made-up coins, even ones that he'd made up himself.\n\nAnd it was like this sort of unreality bubble that was created by the numbers, the prices of all these cryptocurrencies going up and up. It just became hard to question. Even the craziest things that all these people are saying.\n\nBECKER: I suppose it's easy to look at it now that there's been such a big fall and say, \"Wow, how did so many people believe that?\"\n\nBut I think, as you mentioned, two years ago, this was a very big deal. I remember, actually, one of my grown children saying he wanted to invest in Bitcoin. I said, \"I don't understand it.\" And I literally said this because I have a drawer of buttons in my house. I said, \"If I convince everyone that my buttons are worth a million dollars, then they are worth a million dollars?\n\nAnd that's Bitcoin.\" And he told me I was being ridiculous, but I still wonder whether that's true now. But also, I just want to point out that in 2021, the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, announced that his government was going to be betting on Bitcoin. And we actually have a bit of tape from him at that year's Bitcoin conference with a lot of cheers from crypto enthusiasts about his government's use of Bitcoin.\n\nLet's listen.\n\nNAYIB BUKELE: Next week, I will send to Congress a bill that will make Bitcoin a legal tender in El Salvador. In the short term, this will generate jobs and help provide financial inclusion to thousands outside the formal economy. And in the medium and long term, we hope that this small decision can help us push forward (CHEERS).\n\nBECKER: And following that announcement, the government of El Salvador encouraged businesses to use Bitcoin. Zeke Faux, you traveled to El Salvador. What did you find out there?\n\nFAUX: So I'm just returning to your button story for a minute, it would be hard to sell your buttons for a million dollars.\n\nBut imagine how happy you would be if the government of El Salvador announced that its new currency would be Deborah's buttons, right? That would obviously be very good for the price of, for Deborah's button prices. So that's why these crypto guys were so thrilled that this country announced that it would use Bitcoin as a currency.\n\nAnd people were literally, I was at this conference. People were, it was one of the first ones I went to, people were in tears, and I just, I was like, what is this weird world, and they all said, you got to go to El Salvador, you got to see, it's the future, it's going to help the poor, they're all using Bitcoin. And the listeners are probably asking themselves, \"What does this even mean, how does this make sense?\" And it doesn't make sense. I got there, and one of the first places I went to was this little roadside store.\n\nAnd the president had passed this Bitcoin law, which meant that all businesses were supposed to accept Bitcoin as payment. The country's main currency is the dollar, and they didn't abandon that. But they're supposed to also use Bitcoin. And I went to the store, and I pulled, I grabbed, I asked for a bottle of water.\n\nAnd the clerk gave it to me, so I'm holding the water. And then in my terrible gringo Spanish, I said, \"Puedo pagar con Bitcoin, por favor?\" And the clerk just said, \"Basura!\" Trash! And grabbed the water out of my hand, and just walked away. Get out of here, you dumb tourist. I don't want to use your Bitcoin.\n\nAnd that was the attitude I got all over the place. Despite this huge push from the president, the currency was totally rejected by the people. Stores would only use it begrudgingly. And what using Bitcoin means is that they would have a special payment terminal and I could use an app on my phone to send my Bitcoins to them instead of using my credit card or my dollars, but the terminals never worked right.\n\nThey're very slow on there and people complained. \"Hey, the price of Bitcoin goes up and down a lot. Why would I want to accept that for my surf lesson or to sell you a beer? How about you just give me some dollars?\" So the ones that did accept that it was just as like a courtesy for the annoying Bitcoin tourists, which I became one of.\n\nBECKER: If we go back to the buttons for a minute, the buttons are at least tangible. I understand the use of them, right? I can sew a button on and it will keep clothing together or whatever. But I don't get the, what are you getting here from, how do you explain that to people, what you're getting?\n\nIt's a new currency. And how is it safe? How are these merchants in El Salvador who are not taking Bitcoin because they're skeptical, how do they know that it's safe?\n\nFAUX: You've just made your first mistake with button currency. By giving it a purpose, now it's, we can say, okay, it's only worth like a nickel or something, we need to be like, it's better to never say what it's for, and you can just make it sound like an amazing story that, this is a, who knows what millions of uses it'll have in the future. This is the future of money. The price of buttons is going to the moon.\n\nBitcoin, yes, it isn't anything. And I spent a long time trying to understand how it worked. And honestly, my book is not the one to read if you really want to get into the details of the blockchain and how it works. But I realized that the gist is pretty simple. Essentially there's a database. And column A is a list of people and column B, think of a Google sheet, column B is how much money they have.\n\nAnd the Bitcoin database is maintained collectively by all these computers. And it keeps track of how many people, all the people. And the column B, instead of how many dollars they have, is how many Bitcoin you have. So when I send someone a Bitcoin, they're not receiving anything really tangible. Just we're subtracting one from my line on the database and adding one to their line. And people, even now, people will pay almost 30, 000 to make that happen.\n\nBECKER: Even now.\n\nFAUX: It's wild.\n\nBECKER: So again, I wonder. What do you find to be the, you've written a lot of anecdotes in this book, but what you find to be the, one of the most amazing anecdotes that you find yourself going back to, about getting people to believe in the potential of Bitcoin, let's say that, as its purpose and the reason to get on board?\n\nFAUX: One of my favorite stories, I traveled all around the world for this book, and one of my favorite stories comes from the Philippines, it's about a different cryptocurrency called Smooth Love Potions, which is a pretty silly name, and this was a cryptocurrency that you could earn by playing a mobile game called Axie Infinity, so you played this game on your phone, which it sort of looked like Pok\u00e9mon, except that the creatures were based on these Mexican axolotls, these very cute little monsters.\n\nYou have your team of monsters, and the more you fought in the game, the more Smooth Love Potions you earned. And crypto people were promoting this as not just a fun game, but a new form of work. A way that the world's poor could earn a living. And they said that this was the main example of Web 3, which is supposed to be a way that we would all own our data on the internet, and that we could use it to make money instead of just giving it away for free to the Facebooks and Googles of the world.\n\nSeriously, they said that this game could be a panacea for global poverty and you might be asking, \"Well, why would you want any Smooth Love Potions?\" And the answer is, \"Well, you need them breed your Axie monsters to play the game.\" And then you might say, \"Why do I want any Axie monsters?\" And the reason is you need them to earn the Smooth Love Potions. So like it never made any sense. But it totally took off in the Philippines. At its peak, there were maybe a million people playing it.\n\nWhole families were out of work because of the pandemic, and they were just playing Axie all day. And the price of Smooth Love Potions actually got pretty high, to the point that you could earn several, like a living wage, for a few months there, just clicking buttons on your phone and having these Axies play each other.\n\nBECKER: Because you would get a cut of the volume of people playing. In a way.\n\nFAUX: Yeah the game just kept making more and more Smooth Love Potions, and as long as there were new people coming in to buy the love potions to make the monsters. They had some value. But of course this whole thing collapsed. And I went out there to see it for myself and to meet some of the people who had invested in this, and I saw it as a test case for what the vision of the future that the crypto people were promoting.\n\nBECKER: And all of these people lost money.\n\nFAUX: Some people did okay because they had been working as hired game players, like they would be almost like renting monsters from others and earning an hourly wage for playing. But other people had borrowed lots of money to buy their monsters, because the price of the monsters got to be pretty high, like a team might be a thousand dollars.\n\nThey would borrow money thinking they could earn a living from this. And my cab driver said that he had lost $2,100 that he borrowed from his wife's sisters. And, this was so significant to him that he was contemplating suicide. And he said that he'd just been addicted to this game.\n\nHe was convinced it was the way he was going to earn his way to his financial goals. And when the thing collapsed, he was devastated. I talked with another woman who lived in a sort of shanty town in Manila, and she'd borrowed $1,500 from her mother. She still checked the price of Smooth Love Potions all the time on a cryptocurrency exchange like FTX where you could buy and sell them.\n\nBecause she was really hoping they'd come back up, but she'd lost so much money that she and her husband were considering leaving their small children with her parents and moving abroad to Dubai to find new jobs. And this all had collapsed, well before FTX, but it was memory hold by the crypto world. And I had wondered, would they adapt their products?\n\nWould they change because of this Axie collapse? And instead, all I saw, again and again, was people promoting new schemes that were similar. And so it seemed like so much of these cryptocurrencies were really like totally unsustainable bubbles at best.\n\nBECKER: And yet they kept attracting people.\n\nAnd the games would just evolve, the currencies would just evolve, the exchanges would just evolve. And we should say that the whole reason really you started writing about this was because of another exchange called Tether. And you describe Tether as the molten core, right?\n\nOf all of this. And it is actually supposed to be a stable coin that's matched dollar for dollar with the U. S. dollar, right?\n\nFAUX: Yeah. So this was a kind of mystery that I felt like I could really dig into. Tether, you can think of it as the central bank of crypto. And the major players in crypto use it to move their money around. And Tether tokens are supposed to always be worth a dollar because they're backed by real dollars in a bank somewhere.\n\nBut when I started out two years ago, there were about 50 billion Tether tokens in circulation, which meant that Tether was supposed to have 50 billion real dollars somewhere.\n\nThey weren't saying exactly where. There are a lot of rumors flying about whether that money was real or not. And there was so much concern about this that Janet Yellen had called a meeting of all of the top financial regulators, their meeting in Washington, D.C. to discuss Tether and whether it posed a risk to the global financial system.\n\nAnd now as I started researching this, it just started to seem silly to me. One of the founders of the coin was a child actor from The Mighty Ducks. The guy running the company.\n\nBECKER: The Disney movie.\n\nFAUX: Yes he plays the coach in a flashback, misses a penalty shot. And the guy running the company had never given an interview.\n\nHe was a former plastic surgeon from Italy. The CEO on paper was seen so little in public, people wondered if he existed, and the company wasn't even really based anywhere in the world.\n\nFAUX: So I'm like, how did this get so big? Why are concerns about this silly coin dreamed up by The Mighty Ducks guy reaching the highest levels of the U.S. government?\n\nWhere's this $50 billion? And it was just like this irresistible mystery that sucked me into the crypto world.\n\nBECKER: And where's the money?\n\nFAUX: The search took me a lot of weird places by the end, I was in Cambodia, looking into crypto fueled human trafficking and Chinese gangsters using Tether to run these multinational scams.\n\nSearching for this money was like the craziest adventure I've been on in my career.\n\nBECKER: And did you ever get a satisfactory answer?\n\nFAUX: Even as, in the summer of 2022, Crypto companies started collapsing one after another, and FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried came in November, a few months after the market really fell.\n\nAnd this whole time, a lot of people who were suspicious of Tether were watching and saying, \"This is going to be the time that if Tether doesn't really have the money, it's going to be revealed.\"\n\nBECKER: Okay, you're going to have to tell us. We're going to find out where the money was revealed after a break.\n\nPart III\n\nBECKER: Zeke, before the break, you were talking about how you got interested in writing about the cryptocurrency world and your look at the exchange called Tether, and whether Tether actually had stored the assets that it claimed to have stored. So can you tell us what you found out?\n\nFAUX: So now Tether has grown even bigger than ever. It seems it survived the collapse that destroyed so many other crypto companies. And if you believe their numbers, they now have $80 billion.\n\nAnd because interest rates have risen in general, the company, which is a tiny operation, can invest that money in relatively and totally safe U.S. treasuries. And earn 5% a year. So these, the people that run it, like this former plastic surgeon, are now billionaires. They came out the winners of this crypto collapse.\n\nBECKER: You had difficulty finding this. You mentioned Janet Yellen. But we're talking about billions of dollars. At the same time that words are coming out of your mouth, like buying Monsters and Mighty Ducks and things that just don't seem to all often go together. Let's just put it that way.\n\nSo what do you make of this? And why do so many people believe that this is safe? Why do companies like Tether continue to survive, perhaps even thrive, despite these things when there doesn't appear to be any sort of regulatory safety going on?\n\nFAUX: So I think that during this bubble, like if you were interested in getting in crypto, whether it's Tether or Smooth Love Potions, or trading on FTX or whatever, most people, they weren't really true believers.\n\nIt was more that they heard their neighbor had made a lot of money on Bitcoin and renovated their kitchen, the one that happened to me. And they're not thinking, \"I'm getting in early on the future of finance by buying Dogecoin.\" They're thinking, \"I'm smart. I'll buy Dogecoin. I'm early, I'm going to buy it now. Other people are going to get in later, the price will go up, and I'll get out, while the getting is good, and I'm going to make a lot of money.\"\n\nAnd the problem is that just can't be, it doesn't work for everybody, it can't be true for everybody.\n\nBECKER: Somebody's left holding the bag, right?\n\nFAUX: Yeah, and there's a Wall Street guy who got into crypto, named Mike Novogratz, and early on he said, \"This is going to be the largest bubble of our lifetimes, prices are going to get way ahead of where they should be.\n\nYou can make a whole lot of money on the way up, and we plan on it.\" And, he did, he made a lot of money. And so did a lot of other people who got in early. But, if you're like me, by the time you hear about something, it's probably too late, it's probably the real smart money was in at the beginning, they're the people who created these coins, and, if you're coming in at the end, by the time you're coming in, it's closer to the end than the beginning, and you're more likely to be the bag holder.\n\nBECKER: Right? Because you're making the money at the expense of others. Many people who probably, can't afford to lose their retirement savings to this.\n\nFAUX: Yes. I spoke to teachers, factory workers, students, people around the world who had sunk their money into crypto.\n\nWhether it was because of FOMO or whether they really thought this was safe and a good way to invest. And people lost real money. It changed their lives. They've had to put off buying houses or going to, paying for college. It truly was, caused a lot of harm. And it's not just people who had their money at FTX.\n\nAlthough, definitely those people too, even people who bet on crypto and won, if they happen to have their money at one of the many crypto companies that failed, now it's gone. It was a lot of fun while everything was going up and up. I certainly felt a tinge of sadness that I wasn't getting rich off Dogecoin myself.\n\nBut now that the whole thing has collapsed, it's hard to see the appeal.\n\nBECKER: Yet Tether is still thriving.\n\nFAUX: Yeah, no, one of the reasons I found that some people use Tether is that it can be used for illicit activities. So the one I mentioned in Cambodia is a kind of scam called pig butchering.\n\nThis is like a totally crazy story that you'll have to read about, but it would essentially, these scam, these spam text messages that we all get, they're meant to lure people into crypto scams, which happen to be run by often Chinese gangsters who are based in other countries in Southeast Asia.\n\nI spoke to one crypto tracing expert who estimated that $10 billion had been lost to these crypto scams. People really get these spam messages and then are convinced to send hundreds or even hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions of dollars to scammers who say, \"Hey, I've got this great trick for trading crypto.\n\nWouldn't you want to get rich?\"\n\nAnd I bet they're having a harder time now, but during the bubble, that was a pretty good pitch. We all knew people who had made a lot of money on crypto, and hey this kind stranger who sent me a message about whether I bought dog food on the way home seems to have the secret for me.\n\nWhy don't I give it a try?\n\nBECKER: I wonder, do you think, Ponzi schemes have been around for a long time. Scammers have been around for a long time. Certainly not to this scale, but is there something different about what's happening culturally right now? Why does it seem that this has been allowed to grow to the level that it has been able to?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nFAUX: To me, first off, a lot of people in crypto genuinely believe in it. And they got caught up in the hype like anybody else. And if you had some idea for a new app or something, wouldn't you be excited that everybody would, wanted to buy in? And even if prices got really high, I don't know that I would have the self-control to say, \"Hey, don't invest in my coin.\n\nIt's gone up too high,\" or something like that. But for the scammers, there were just so many people ignoring so many securities laws. It was almost like a January 6th riot of securities violations. There's, the cops don't even know where to start. And I think that they're going to be, with these cryptocurrencies, it made it so easy to start a new investment scheme.\n\nIt's the authorities are going to be like digging through these companies for years to come, trying to see if they violated the laws that have protected investors for almost 100 years and in traditional markets.\n\nBECKER: I wonder, there is a story in the book that I wonder if you could briefly tell about NFTs, which are part of this whole world.\n\nFirst explain what it is and why you actually bought one? Because that part of the book made me a little nervous.\n\nFAUX: Yeah, I was very nervous too, but if you really want to try out crypto, just sending your money to an exchange and trading it is not really, there's nothing that crypto-y about that.\n\nThe appeal of crypto is that you could, it could, it's decentralized and you could control your coins yourself in on your wallet and there'd be no need for a bank or an exchange or some sort of intermediary to help you handle your money.\n\nSo many people told me I should check this out. I decided to do it. One of the people who teased me about how I hadn't tried it was trying to get me to buy into his club, which was called Solana Monkey Business. And in order to join this club, you had to buy this NFT, which is a kind of crypto token, for $25,000.\n\nBECKER: Non fungible.\n\nFAUX: Non fungible token. It's like digital art. What it essentially boils down to, often, are like these ugly cartoons that cost thousands of dollars. I decided if I was going to join one of these clubs to buy one of these NFTs, I wanted the one that celebrities have. That's called the Bored Ape Yacht Club.\n\nIt's been promoted by Jimmy Fallon, Paris Hilton, Brady, Tom Brady had one, Justin Bieber. It was really, it was a trend in Hollywood and in sports for a while. And people, once you bought one, you could make it your profile picture. And they went for as much as, $500,000, a million dollars at the time.\n\nI decided I was going to try it out. I sat my wife down one night after the kids were in bed. And I was like, \"Nikki, I got to talk to you about something for the book.\" And I explained this whole thing about the Bored Ape Yacht Club and they were having a party. And you had to come, it was headlined by Snoop and Eminem.\n\nIt's going to be a weeklong festival; you needed an ape to come. I told her this would be great material for the book, but it's expensive. And she's like, \"How much are we talking?\" And I said, the cheapest ones, which are these ape derivatives, they're like these kind of ugly, even uglier, melted apes, were going for $40,000.\n\nThat's what it's going to be. She was totally horrified, but she was very supportive of the project. I explained that I didn't intend to lose this money, hopefully I could sell my mutant ape and recover it. And she said, \"That does sound like good material for the book, give it a try.\"\n\nAnd I found it actually a lot more educational than I expected. Because, when I went to go buy this ape, alright, first off, the price had gone down to, by the time I got around to it, the price was down to $20,000, which was cool because I didn't want to spend $40,000, but also bad because it showed that the price could go from $40,000 to $20,000 really fast.\n\nBECKER: For a digital cartoon of an ape.\n\nFAUX: Yes.\n\nBECKER: Okay. This is a picture, just to make clear.\n\nFAUX: The one I got, it's orange, it's just like a pretty simple cartoon of a melted ape smoking a pipe with a sweater. Made of maggots.\n\nBECKER: And okay. And the only way we can buy this digital ape is with crypto.\n\nFAUX: Yeah. And this is, I had spent so long looking into this, but then I started to actually do it. I had to learn how to send my money into crypto land. And what it boiled down to is, in your web browser, there's the place where you type the URL, and then maybe you've got a little red icon next to that for the ad block.\n\nNow, I installed one that was a picture of a fox, and now my money would live in the picture of the fox. And, before I installed the picture of the fox icon, I had to watch a video, in which they instructed me that if I made any typos, or lost the password, my $20,000 would be gone. And that I should engrave the password on a metal plate, and bury it in my backyard.\n\nWhich I did not do, despite their instructions. And I'd never been so happy to get a call from Bank of America customer service. I was trying to wire the $20,000 to a crypto exchange. It's a very convoluted process and this friendly rep said, \"Zeke like we see you're trying to wire Money to buy crypto, this is often a scam.\n\nYou might be getting scammed right now. Are you sure that you want us to?\" And I was just like, \"Oh, thank you traditional financial system. So very, so nice of, so thoughtful of you to check out my transactions and call me. Representative I am being scammed and please put it through I need to buy my ugly cartoon monkey.\" So yes, I acquired this mutant ape. I went to Ape Fest, and what I found was first off, the idea of owning one of these is supposed to be this big flex, impress everybody, but my friends and family were just, they just thought I was stupid for buying the ape.\n\nAnd I sent it to my mom, I sent the picture of the ape, and then she just sent it back to me. She said, \"It's my ape now.\" And, I was like, \"No mom, this is the future of art. I own this ape on the blockchain. I can't really explain how I own it, but I do own it. Even though you have the exact same picture on your phone now.\n\nI'm the only one who paid $20,000 for it. It's not yours.\" But that wasn't very satisfying. And then at ApeFest, the other ape people, they would pretend to be nice, but I could see what they were thinking. They all were like, \"This is the worst Ape I've ever seen.\" Even pimply teenagers would be like, \"My ape cost a million dollars.\n\nYou're a loser. You barely got into this party.\" It didn't serve its purpose. And the whole time I had it, I was just terrified. Even though I could see that every day people were buying and selling these apes, I just had this feeling that no one will ever, I would be the last sucker to pay $20,000 for the cartoon monkey.\n\nNo one will take it off my hands.\n\nBECKER: Okay, did you get your money back?\n\nFAUX: Someone did buy it. I was very happy, very relieved. I lost about $2,000, mostly on transaction fees.\n\nYou think crypto is pitched as this great easier, faster, cheaper way to move money around. But in my experience, I always got hit with a ton of fees.\n\nAt least like $1,000 in fees on selling this ape. But I've never been so relieved to lose $2,000. I was just glad that nobody stole it. And that I got most of the money back.\n\nBECKER: We have just a couple of minutes left, and I think I want to end with the question of, \"Is there use for crypto?\"\n\nIs there really solid, legit use, are we just figuring our way to a new world of finance or currencies or whatever here? Or has this just been one big experiment that hasn't gone that well? How would you describe it?\n\nFAUX: You can hear a lot of ideas about crypto that sound totally convincing for a minute or even like an hour or two, but I think we can only really judge it by what it's done so far.\n\nAnd Bitcoin's as old as Uber. It's as old as WhatsApp and ask yourself, have you ever used it for anything? Do you know anyone who's ever used it for anything? And if the only good use that crypto had come up with, was it was this fun thing you could gamble on at these offshore casinos. Now, some of those casinos have been revealed to be frauds.\n\nPeople have lost all their money and it's not even fun thing to gamble on anymore.\n\nBECKER: So basically, no. No use.\n\nFAUX: I see it as like a crazy moment in history, a mania, the likes of which we'll never see again."

        "content": "There may be over 10 financial giants filing to launch a Bitcoin ETF, but according to one analyst, BlackRock's application may be the one to watch.\n\nIn a CNBC video released Monday, Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman called BlackRock's filing \"much more important\" than the other prospective offerings. To date, other applicants include Fidelity, Digital Currency Group, and most recently Franklin Templeton, which joined the race just last week.\n\n\"If Blackrock has an ETF, you know that they are going to win. They have the marketing and distribution to put new people into Bitcoin,\" Dorman said.\n\nAccording to the CNBC, BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset management firms, has been closely monitoring the cryptocurrency market for some time, even quietly exploring ways to incorporate Bitcoin into its investment strategies.\n\nThis prospective move by BlackRock could signal a major vote of confidence in the cryptocurrency and might encourage other institutional investors to follow suit.\n\nElsewhere in the video, experts shed light on how a spot Bitcoin ETF could provide traditional investors with a regulated and accessible gateway into the cryptocurrency market. Experts believe that once the SEC approves a Bitcoin ETF, it will likely attract a broad spectrum of investors, from retail traders to institutional players, who have been waiting for a regulated vehicle to enter the crypto space.\n\nAlready, Bitcoin Futures ETFs are publicly traded, though these funds notably do not buy or sell Bitcoin on the open market.\n\nFinally, the experts noted Bitcoin's broader narrative as a decentralized digital currency and store of value, as well as how the upcoming halving, in which the rewards Bitcoin pays out to the miners that secure the protocol will be reduced, could put a positive pressure on its price dynamics.\n\nTaken together, the CNBC report was confident enough to declare a \"next bull market\" may soon be in store.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Remains Above $27K as Fed Not Likely to Close the Door on Rate Hikes: Analyst - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Us, traders are anticipating no change in rates as the Federal Open Markets Committee two day meeting kicks off today. Joining us now to discuss the crypto markets is Forex dot com. Global head of research, Matt Welner. Good morning, Matt. Hey Martin, thanks for having me on. So I assume you are with the vast majority of humanity that thinks that there will be no change in rates today uh this week. But uh do you see uh at least even a potential for another sad 25 basis points uh increase before the end of the year just because? Yeah, absolutely. I, I do not think we should close the door on rate hikes and I do not expect the Federal Reserve tomorrow to close the door on rate hikes. In fact, I expect the median dot in their dot plot where they forecast where interest rates and other economic variables will be that could well still signal another interest rate hike. Probably in the December time frame. Inflation continues to remain above expectations. So right now, it's a good opportunity for the fed to, to sort of sit on their hands, be data dependent as they've argued they have been for, for years now and uh see if that data continues to support another rate hike. But if we just take a step back, the broader trend is the fact that we're nearing people interest rates really across the globe. We might see one more rate hike in England. We might see one in Switzerland this week. But at the end of the day, we're, we're probably one and done in a lot of these countries and that, that peak interest rate phenomenon and the potential for future rate cuts is something that could be supportive of the crypto asset markets as we move into 2024 and beyond. Yeah, that, that has to do, of course, with the idea that uh if rates stay the same or even lower, it makes it easier for uh people to take on risk and, and the cost of borrowing if, if rates fall uh becomes cheaper and they could take on leverage. But something interesting happened yesterday. We had a, we, we had this flash sell off if you will. Um And I'm wondering how much of that it, it, it doesn't seem at least to be based on macro issues, but it does. Do you think that it was specifically related? I don't know, I wanna say potentially Binance, it could well be um this is something that perhaps is of most interest to very short term traders. It, it, it was a, a big drop. On a short term basis. But I, if we take a step back again, we're still in that broader range. As the chart shows, we're, we're finding a lot of support around 25 K. We're finding resistance up at 32 K. We dropped from the mid 20 sevens, I believe in this, this flash crash back down to 27 K or so. And we're, we're sort of in no man's land in the middle of that range. I would say if we can get sustainably above 28 K that opens up the highs of the year near 32 K. Meanwhile, if this 25 K range breaks, which is certainly a possibility, especially if central banks do start to squeeze in a couple last rate hikes, maybe we'll, we'll see some downside toward 24 K. But uh the short term outlook is very much range bound. II, I guess my question has to do is I, I mean, are there any structural issues that the market seems to be concerned about? I, I think it, I think it all relates back to the macro environment. It's just much less favorable than it has been for the entirety of Bitcoin's life and uh Ethereum and all the other crypto assets. We, we were in essentially a 0% interest rate regime for almost that entire period. Now, we have to see how these assets perform in a higher interest rate uh regime and And frankly, I think some of the performance we've seen this year from Bitcoin and Ethereum and other crypto assets has sort of, um, uh, put to rest, some concerns that it was solely a low interest rate phenomenon. We're still seeing decent performance, uh, at least prices holding up despite the high interest rates. And I think that's something that's very bullish long term. Is there anything interesting going on in the market besides Bitcoin? Well, there's always interesting stuff going on. I think we, we're still in that sort of, uh, maybe, uh crypto spring period. Everyone talks about a crypto winter. We've certainly seen a bounce back in prices, but there's a lot of building underneath the surface. Um, if we're talking about Bitcoin, some of the things like ordinals and inscriptions are, are essentially types of NFTS almost on Bitcoin that I think has, uh, provided a bit of a lift to the crypto asset. And of course, in Ethereum and other smart contracts, we see, uh, apps being built gaming, I think is, is an area that got overhyped a couple of years ago but is starting to find a little bit of product market fit. So, uh, it, it's, it, nothing is really broken through to the mass consumer adoption stage, but we're, we're sort of in that period of the cycle and there's certainly some green shoots that, uh, that I think we, we should keep our eyes on to see if something starts to get momentum uh whether that could help lead us to the next stage in, in a new uh crypto bowl cycle. Matt. Let's take a look at this chart on Bitcoin dominance. It shows it's at 50% and still trending higher unpack what we're seeing here. Yeah, of course. So Bitcoin dominance is just the proportion of the total crypto market cap. Uh uh Bitcoin makes up it historically, it was very high when crypto, when Bitcoin was the only crypto asset, uh it, it dropped very low. I I in bull markets as traders kind of invest in higher volatility, riskier alt coins that are seeing bigger returns. The key thing to watch with this chart moving forward is the fact that Bitcoin dominance tends to trend higher in bear markets. And and we are seeing Bitcoin dominance trending higher, in fact is right about at 50% after getting as low as below 40%. Uh it uh in the in the peak bull market period. So what traders will be looking at to sort of signal the the next leg higher in crypto assets as a whole would actually be Bitcoin dominance falling. That indicates that investors in the space are feeling more optimistic, get optimistic, more uh eager to take on risk and buying what's a little bit further out on the risk curve. Of course, all of this is pretty far out uh relative to traditional investments. But if you start to move towards some of those alt coins. That's when we see Bitcoin dominance rolling over. And that's when we can really see, uh of course, Bitcoins still rising, maybe not as fast as small coins, but that's really what investors will be looking to see uh for the next full, you know, 111 thing that we've, uh you know, a, a common theme that a few of our guests have had is that the, this kind of seems to be the apocalypse, which is a term that I brought up yesterday that there are fundamental issues that are involved, which uh is scaring people away from the alt it. Do, do you think that that's going to affect Bitcoin dominance in a different way? I mean, I mean, you know, you talk about risk on, risk off or increased appetite for risk would put people into all. But uh doesn't that hurdle rate get higher and higher? Uh actually, because of the fundamentals behind the adoption of all coins and people just saying, you know what, I'm not getting anything out of this. Why do I need this? Is that, does that kind of change that equation a bit? I, I think it, it, it's a, a savvy observation. I, I think a lot of it relates again to that macro environment where previously we had 0% interest rates, we had venture capitalists eager to spray money at anything having to do with crypto and, and getting again themselves further out on the risk curve. Now we're in a more reserved environment and I think that's going to take some of those long tail assets and, and just frankly make them not, not investable and, and not at a stage where they can start to get some momentum. But uh alt coins is a very broad topic. I do think uh some of the smart contract platforms obviously ethereum, things like solana and avalanche are getting some traction. So I, I think there's certain um chains, coins tokens that have made it over the threshold, but certainly to your point, it's gonna be uh I think a lot more difficult for things to come out of nowhere and get a lot of sustainable momentum and be, be uh tokens that we're talking about in the next cycle and beyond Matt, what are the whales doing? Are you doing any whale watching? How important is it to watch these big wallets? Uh When it comes to what's going on in the markets? Yes, it's absolutely essential what I like to look at, especially when it comes to Bitcoin are long term holders. Um different providers uh define this in different ways. But essentially, uh the, the numbers show if, if someone's held Bitcoin for about half of a year, that indicates they're not a trader, they're not trying to flip it for quick profits. And a lot of times those are the coins that, that essentially go into the cold storage and are never seen again. And uh that figure, if you look at Bitcoin long term holders is actually a approaching its highest level ever as a proportion of total supply near 75%. I think this is a potentially bullish sign and, and something we frequently see before uh big bullish moves because again, that that creates the environment for a supply shock. So if there is a catalyst that has traders rushing to buy Bitcoin, essentially, there's a much smaller proportion of that that's really liquid and available. And that can really juice prices. Again, if there's any sort of catalyst that causes demand to pick up, Matt, thank you very much for joining us this morning and providing that insight. My pleasure. Thank you. That was Forex dot com, Global Head of Research, Matt Weller."

        "title": "Bitcoin price eyes $28K as Binance legal battle spurs bullish momentum - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The ongoing legal battle between the Binance cryptocurrency exchange and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took a surprising turn on Sept. 18.\n\nMagistrate Judge Zia Faruqui rejected the SEC\u2019s request for access to Binance.US\u2019s systems. Instead, the judge suggested that the SEC should formulate specific discovery requests.\n\nWhile this decision only temporarily postponed the need for Binance to demonstrate the separation between Binance.US\u2019s custody solution and Binance International, the market responded positively.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) surged to its highest level in three weeks, breaking above the $27,000 resistance. Traders are now wondering whether the rally has been supported by leverage or genuine spot buying demand.\n\nThis is where metrics related to Bitcoin derivatives could potentially provide the solution.\n\nInvestors must wait three weeks for further rulings\n\nJudge Faruqui scheduled a follow-up hearing for Oct. 12 and called upon the involved parties to submit a status report before the event, as reported by Yahoo Finance. What might have seemed like a setback for the SEC, at least for the time being, could potentially increase the risks for Binance.\n\nBinance founder and CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao remains steadfast in asserting that Binance.US has never utilized Binance\u2019s global custody solutions, despite a document from Binance.US on Sep. 15 suggesting otherwise. Nevertheless, the SEC has yet to produce clear evidence of Binance attempting to mislead the court.\n\nRegardless of the current evidence, or more accurately, the absence of reliable information provided by Binance, the outlook for Bitcoin bulls has significantly improved for the next three weeks, with no anticipated changes until the upcoming court hearing.\n\nTo gauge the increasing optimism among professional traders, let\u2019s examine Bitcoin\u2019s margin and derivatives metrics.\n\nBitcoin margin, options show clear path toward $28,000\n\nMargin markets offer valuable insights into the positioning of professional traders as they enable investors to increase their exposure through stablecoin borrowing.\n\nConversely, Bitcoin borrowers can speculate on a cryptocurrency\u2019s price decline. A declining indicator suggests that traders are becoming less bullish, while a ratio exceeding 30 typically indicates excessive confidence.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin-lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nRecent data reveals that the margin-lending ratio for OKX traders has dropped to its lowest point in three months, standing at 19x, down from 27x just a week ago. These findings suggest that the overwhelming dominance of leverage long positions has diminished, although the current ratio still favors the bulls.\n\nMarket sentiment can also be assessed by analyzing whether more activity is occurring through call (buy) options or put (sell) options.\n\nA put-to-call ratio of 0.70 indicates that put option open interest lags behind the more bullish calls, implying a bullish momentum. Conversely, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, signifying bearish sentiment.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nThe put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options volume has recently shifted from favoring put options at 1.50 to a balanced 1.04 level on Sept. 20, indicating a reduced interest in protective puts.\n\nNotably, since Sept. 18, BTC options volume has either been neutral or slightly favored put options, suggesting that professional traders were caught off-guard by the price rally above $27,000.\n\nRelated: Binance CEO refutes report on $250M loan to BAM Management\n\nBoth Bitcoin margin and options markets indicate a balanced demand between long and short positions. From a bullish perspective, this suggests that excessive leverage hasn\u2019t been utilized as Bitcoin\u2019s price climbed from $26,500 to $27,500 on Sept. 19.\n\nHowever, bears may find solace in the fact that even as Bitcoin\u2019s price reached its highest level in three weeks, there was limited enthusiasm from buyers in the margin and options markets.\n\nNonetheless, the data does hint at buying support from spot orders, possibly indicating that big entities, or so-called whales, are accumulating regardless of price.\n\nNow, BTC and other crypto bulls have a window of three more weeks until Oct. 12, when the Federal Judge will convene another hearing and potentially issue orders that could pose challenges for Binance.US. In the meantime, a Bitcoin price rally above $28,000 is certainly on the table.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Reasons for Another Bitcoin Bull Run - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency aficionados and investors have been keenly following the moves of Bitcoin, the digital currency market's pioneer and bellwether. Bitcoin is displaying symptoms of a potential bull run after seeing unprecedented price rises and subsequent falls over the years. We examine the main causes for the renewed interest in Bitcoin, as well as the variables that may contribute to another large price gain.\n\nAdoption in Institutions\n\nThe increased institutional use of cryptocurrencies is one of the key drivers of Bitcoin's recent recovery. Institutional investors, such as hedge funds, asset managers, and publicly traded firms, have begun putting money into Bitcoin. The bitcoin market gains credibility and legitimacy as a result of this institutional involvement.\n\nHigh-profile endorsements and investments from firms such as Tesla and Square have gotten a lot of attention in the media, helping to shift the perception of cryptocurrencies from speculative assets to real stores of value and investment options. Institutional participation frequently results in increased liquidity and stability in the bitcoin market, which might attract more investors.\n\nFactors Affecting the Economy at Large\n\nGlobal macroeconomic factors have played a critical role in driving Bitcoin interest. Uncertainty in traditional financial markets has encouraged investors to seek alternative assets for diversification and as a hedge against inflation, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 epidemic and accompanying economic stimulus measures.\n\nBitcoin, also known as \"digital gold,\" is considered as a safe haven asset by certain investors, analogous to physical gold. Because Bitcoin has a fixed number of 21 million coins, it is resistant to inflationary pressures, this belief has gained popularity during times of economic crisis and currency devaluation.\n\nInstitutional Infrastructure Development\n\nWith the creation of institutional-grade infrastructure, the bitcoin ecosystem has evolved dramatically over the last few years. The addition of Bitcoin futures contracts on regulated exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has made it easier for institutional investors to obtain exposure to Bitcoin while remaining compliant with regulatory regulations.\n\nIn addition to futures contracts, the emergence of cryptocurrency custodial services, over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks, and cryptocurrency-focused investment funds has made institutional entry into the market more convenient and secure. These advances have lowered the entry hurdles for large investors, contributing to the overall expansion of the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nScarcity and Event Halving\n\nThe scarcity of Bitcoin is a key driver of its value. Bitcoin is supposed to be deflationary, with a maximum supply of 21 million coins. This scarcity is exacerbated by Bitcoin halving occurrences, which occur about every four years. During a halving event, the rewards for validating transactions are cut in half, lowering the rate at which new Bitcoins enter the market.\n\nBitcoin halving events have often accompanied large price gains. The slowing of new supply, along with rising demand, causes a supply-demand mismatch that can drive up prices. The most recent Bitcoin halving occurred in May 2020, and the market is currently feeling the effects of its effects on supply dynamics.\n\nAcceptance and Awareness in the Mainstream\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general have garnered considerable acceptance and recognition in the mainstream. Cryptocurrency developments are constantly covered by major financial news sites, and significant players in the financial and technology industries freely discuss and invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis enhanced visibility and awareness benefits retail investor participation. As more individuals become interested in cryptocurrencies, a natural flood of new investors occurs, which can fuel demand and contribute to price momentum upward.\n\nTechnological Advances\n\nThe blockchain, the underlying technology of Bitcoin, is constantly evolving and improving. Increased scalability, security, and efficiency have resulted from technological advancements in the bitcoin field. Layer 2 alternatives, like as the Lightning Network, seek to overcome Bitcoin's scaling issues by enabling faster and less expensive transactions.\n\nSecurity improvements, such as hardware wallets and multi-signature authentication, have made Bitcoin a more secure asset for investors. These technological improvements boost confidence in Bitcoin's long-term viability and appeal as a digital asset.\n\nClarity in Regulation\n\nWhile regulatory ambiguity has been a source of concern in the cryptocurrency industry, there have been some encouraging developments in terms of regulatory clarity in a number of places. Some countries have enacted explicit legislation controlling the usage and trading of cryptocurrencies, providing businesses and investors with a stable legal framework.\n\nThis regulatory clarity may entice institutional investors who need clear standards to meet legal and compliance needs. It also encourages the growth of cryptocurrency-related businesses and services, which helps to legitimize the market.\n\nEcosystem of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nThe rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has fueled interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Users of DeFi platforms can earn interest, lend, borrow, and trade digital assets without the use of traditional financial intermediaries.\n\nMany DeFi applications are developed on Bitcoin-compatible blockchain systems, allowing users to use Bitcoin as collateral for a variety of financial services inside the DeFi ecosystem. The incorporation of Bitcoin into DeFi enhances its utility beyond that of a store of value and presents it as an asset capable of generating passive income.\n\nBitcoin Surges Beyond $27,000 Ahead of Fed Meeting: What's Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally?\n\nAs reported by Cointelegraph, cryptocurrency markets saw a broad rally on Monday, with Bitcoin surging above $27,000, marking its first such rise this month.\n\nThe precise reason for this market movement remained unclear. However, there was a noticeable spike in trading volume during the Asian market's opening hours.\n\nThis surge in volume came following a report by Japan's Nikkei, suggesting that the Japanese government intends to permit startups to offer digital tokens to venture capital funds, in addition to traditional assets like shares and stock options.\n\nConclusion\n\nA number of factors are driving the resurgence of interest in Bitcoin and the potential for another bull run, including institutional adoption, macroeconomic conditions, growing institutional infrastructure, Bitcoin's scarcity, mainstream acceptance, technological advancements, regulatory clarity, and the expanding DeFi ecosystem. These elements have contributed to a favorable climate for Bitcoin as an investment asset as well as a store of value.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and prices can move dramatically in a short period of time. Before entering the cryptocurrency market, investors should perform extensive research, analyze their risk tolerance, and examine their long-term investing objectives. While these elements enhance Bitcoin's potential for another bull run, it is still vulnerable to market dynamics and investor sentiment."

The Bitcoin fund launched by its digital asset arm will now offer investors direct exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nThe Laser Digital Bitcoin Adoption Fund offers long-only exposure to Bitcoin. The financial giant has chosen Komainu as its regulated custody partner. The Bitcoin Fund is a portion of Laser Digital Funds Segregated Portfolio Company that has been registered as a mutual fund in accordance with the Cayman Islands Regulatory Authority.\n\nLaser Digital Asset Management head Sebastien Guglietta said that Bitcoin is one of the enablers of this long-lasting transformational change, and long-term exposure to Bitcoin offers a solution for investors to capture this macro trend.\n\nRelated: Bybit\u2019s MVP license in Dubai \u2018very restricted,\u2019 CEO says\n\nThe Bitcoin Adoption Fund might be the first of its kind launched by Nomura and its digital asset arm, but the Japanese investment banking giant has been investing in the digital asset ecosystem for quite some time already. In September 2022, the firm launched its digital asset venture capital arm to stay at the forefront of digital innovation. Earlier in August this year, Nomura\u2019s crypto arm, Laser Digital, also won Dubai\u2019s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) license to operate in the country.\n\nThe long-only Bitcoin Adoption Fund for investors in Japan comes amid a growing discussion around Bitcoin-based investment products from regulated and mainstream financial giants. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved two Bitcoin-based futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) even though there is a delayed decision on spot Bitcoin ETFs.

        "title": "Bitcoin futures open interest jumps by $1B: Manipulation or hedge? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) open interest on derivatives exchanges experienced a sudden surge of $1 billion on Sept. 18, prompting investors to question whether whales were accumulating in anticipation of the unsealing of Binance\u2019s court filings.\n\nHowever, a closer look at derivatives metrics suggests a more nuanced picture, as the funding rate did not exhibit clear signs of excessive buying demand.\n\nThe decision to unseal these documents was granted to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which had accused Binance of non-cooperation despite previously agreeing to a consent order related to unregistered securities operations and other allegations.\n\nBTC futures aggregate open interest, USD (green, left). Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe open interest spiked to $12.1 billion, while Bitcoin\u2019s price concurrently increased by 3.4%, reaching its highest point in over two weeks at $27,430.\n\nHowever, investors soon realized that, aside from a comment by the Binance.US auditor regarding the challenges of ensuring full collateralization, there was little concrete information revealed in the unsealed documents.\n\nLater in the day, Federal Judge Zia Faruqui rejected the SEC\u2019s request to inspect Binance.US\u2019 technical infrastructure and share additional information. Nevertheless, the judge stipulated that Binance.US must furnish more details about its custody solution, casting doubt on whether Binance International ultimately controls these assets.\n\nBy the end of Sept. 18, Bitcoin\u2019s open interest had receded to $11.3 billion as its price dropped by 2.4% to $26,770. This decline indicated that the entities behind the open interest surge were no longer inclined to maintain their positions.\n\nThese whales were likely disappointed with the court\u2019s outcomes, or the price action may not have unfolded as expected. In any case, 80% of the open interest increase disappeared in less than 24 hours.\n\nFutures\u2019 buyers and sellers are matched at all times\n\nIt can be assumed that most of the demand for leverage was driven by bullish sentiment, as Bitcoin\u2019s price climbed alongside the increase in open interest and subsequently plummeted as 80% of the contracts were closed. However, attributing cause and effect solely to Binance\u2019s court rulings seems unwarranted for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, no one anticipated that the unsealed documents would favor Binance or its CEO, Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, given that it was the SEC that had originally requested their release. Additionally, the Bitcoin futures contract funding rate, which gauges imbalances between long and short positions, remained largely stable throughout this period.\n\nBTC futures average 8-hour funding rate. Source: CoinGlass\n\nIf there had indeed been an unforeseen demand surge of $1 billion in open interest, primarily driven by desperate buyers, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the funding rate would have spiked above 0.01%. However, quite the opposite unfolded on Sept. 19, as Bitcoin\u2019s open interest expanded to $11.7 billion, while the funding rate plunged to zero.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s price rallying above $27,200 during this second phase of open interest growth, it becomes increasingly evident that, regardless of the underlying motives, the price pressure tends to be upward. While the exact rationale may remain elusive, certain trading patterns could shed light on this movement.\n\nMarket makers\u2019 hedge could explain OI spike\n\nOne plausible explanation could be the involvement of market makers in executing buy orders on behalf of substantial clients. This would account for the initial enthusiasm in both the spot market and BTC futures, propelling the price higher. After the initial surge, the market maker becomes fully hedged, eliminating the need for further buying and leading to a price correction.\n\nDuring the second phase of the trade, there is no impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price, as the market maker must offload the BTC futures contracts and purchase spot Bitcoin. This results in a reduction in open interest and may disappoint some participants who were anticipating additional buying fervor.\n\nRather than hastily labeling every \u201cBart\u201d formation as manipulation, it is advisable to delve into the operations of arbitrage desks and carefully analyze the BTC futures funding rate before jumping to conclusions. Thus, when there is no excessive demand for leveraged long positions, an increase in open interest does not necessarily signify a buying spree, as was the case on Sept. 18.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

He believes the best time to buy the assets is now, as they are cheaper.\n\nKiyosaki mentioned America being broke as his reason why people should purchase the leading crypto asset and the precious metals today. He wants them to be prepared for the impending crash in stocks, bonds, and real estate to avoid the rush for the assets once his prediction comes true.\n\nI am constantly asked \u201cWhat price will gold, silver, or Bitcoin be in 2025. My reply is that is a silly question. More important question is how many gold, silver, Bitcoins do you have TODAY? Gold, silver, Bitcoin are bargains today\u2026 but not tommow. America is broke.

He reiterated his opinion in July, explaining that the country\u2019s debt was on the rise and countering claims that the economy was strong. At the time, he stated that the stock market was rising because of the U.S. debt ceiling removal.\n\nKiyosaki frequently refers to bitcoin, gold, and silver as real assets and real money due to his belief that the U.S. dollar will die while they will act as protection measures.\n\nCrypto: The Future of Money\n\nEarlier this year, Kiyosaki disclosed that he is bent on buying more BTC, gold, and silver because the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and President Joe Biden are liars. He has always considered fiat fake money and reiterated his stance on Sunday when he revealed that he was at a \u201cmassive crypto conference\u201d in Singapore.\n\nThe renowned investor stated that crypto is the future of money while fiat is toast.\n\nMeanwhile, Kiyosaki recently predicted that BTC will soar to $120,000 in 2024 as Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa will soon launch a new cryptocurrency backed by gold, which would harm the U.S. dollar."

        "content": "Bitcoin BTC -0.60% 's recent price bounce \u2014 up more than 5% over the last week \u2014 is largely due to rumors of a delay for Mt. Gox repayments into 2024, according to trading firm QCP Capital. However, the firm still targets the $22,000 level for bitcoin in October.\n\nThe deadline for creditors of Mt. Gox, which collapsed in 2014, to provide their repayment information passed in April \u2014 opening the window for repayments to be carried out by Oct. 31. However, the deadline for repayments could be subject to change, the Mt. Gox trustee said at the time. Mt. Gox is set to distribute an unknown portion of the 142,000 BTC ($3.9 billion), 143,000 BCH +3.06% ($31.3 million) and 69 billion Japanese yen ($467 million) that it holds.\n\n\"A large reason we're seeing for this bounce are rumors of a Mt. Gox delay to 2024,\" QCP said in its latest market update. \"With the prior expected date just a month away, we believe many went short on this, and an official announcement will surely drive a short squeeze identical to the release of the SEC vs. GBTC judgment last month.\"\n\nHowever, the crypto trading firm expects the bounce to be short-lived, with any spike to fade quickly as global risks weigh on the crypto markets into Q4, in line with its $22,000 target.\n\n\"The current Wave 2 of our C Wave expanded flat has so far bounced which we expected, but we still need to see the crucial Wave 3 that breaks the local lows for our count to be intact,\" QCP said. \"The invalidation point would likely be a break of prior highs above $32,000.\"\n\nGlobal risks weigh on crypto markets\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nComing into another FOMC interest rate decision week, the S&P 500's volatility index (VIX) has marked its longest streak of trading under 19 since 2020, QCP said. This eerily mirrors the 2020 scenario, QCP argues, which culminated in the record volatility spike due to the Covid crash.\n\nWhile the market remains speculative about another potential volatility squeeze, it's unlikely that the upcoming FOMC meeting will be the trigger, with another pause widely anticipated. The FOMC's appetite for further rate hikes this year also seems minimal, according to QCP.\n\nHowever, \"At the same time, we do not see how Powell can assuredly call an end to this hiking cycle, given the surging pump prices and rebounding inflation,\" the crypto trading firm added, expecting higher for longer rates (no cuts) next year.\n\nA potential U.S. government shutdown at the end of September, with funding for the federal government set to run out unless action is taken by Congress, and rising oil prices all fuel the tail risks, QCP said. It claimed that the Fed was unlikely to act on suppressing volatility this time.\n\n\"In such a scenario without Fed easing, equities will likely be down, taking bitcoin down along with it until the Fed acts,\" the firm added."

        "content": "This week, Cointelegraph reporter Joe Hall takes podcast listeners back to school \u2014 Bitcoin (BTC) school.\n\nOn the latest episode of Decentralize with Cointelegraph, listeners can indulge in interview snippets, soundbites and pearls of wisdom from the likes of Blockstream CEO Adam Back and Tether chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino, as well as professionals in cybersecurity and from Chainalysis.\n\nPaolo Ardoino (left) in an interview with Joe Hall (right).\n\nPlus, hear from students who attended the school about what it\u2019s like to live, breathe, sleep and study crypto for two weeks, 24/7. An Italian Ethereum fan comments on Bitcoin maximalism, Latin Americans observe Europeans\u2019 behavior regarding recycling, and Taiwanese students settle into life around the cryptocurrency.\n\nThis week\u2019s episode of Decentralize also investigates how deep Bitcoin and crypto adoption reaches in Lugano, the distinctly Italian city in the southern section of Switzerland. The city adopted Bitcoin as de facto legal tender one year ago, and there has been noticeable progress since then \u2014 with the Bitcoin \u201cB\u201d logo hard to miss in the town center.\n\nMore than 200 vendors accept Bitcoin in Lugano. Big brands like McDonald\u2019s, Rolex and even Lamborghini will take the cryptocurrency, while some pharmacies, convenience stores and tobacco shops also accept it.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is still not deeply or broadly understood, and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done if Lugano is to one day fully embrace it, as Ardoino explained:\n\n\u201dI wish I was able to say that our job is done, but I think we are just at the beginning. The most important part is the education of the merchants.\u201d\n\nThe point-of-sale devices merchants use across Lugano also accept Tether (USDT) and Luga, a token that locals and residents can use.\n\nRelated: Pro-crypto city of Lugano and El Salvador sign economic agreement based on adoption\n\nTo hear a secret from Back concerning MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, learn what Paraguayans made of Switzerland on their first-ever trip to Europe, and discover why the efforts in Lugano could spread to other areas of Europe, plug in and listen in to this week\u2019s episode of Decentralize with Cointelegraph \u2014 available on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Cointelegraph\u2019s podcast page and more.\n\nThe episode also serves as a sneak preview of an upcoming Cointelegraph documentary about life in Lugano.

        "content": "Japan\u2019s Largest Investment Bank Nomura Launches Bitcoin Adoption Fund\n\nNomura Is Launching A Bitcoin Adoption Fund\n\nLaser Digital Asset Management, a subsidiary of the largest Japanese investment bank Nomura, has launched the Bitcoin Adoption Fund, the first in a series of digital adoption investment options. The fund offers \"long-only exposure to Bitcoin (BTC)\" and is a segment of Laser Digital Funds Segregated Portfolio Company. The aim of the fund is to provide institutional investors with a secure path into digital asset investment. Nomura Holdings is a $500 billion financial giant that provides brokerage, investment banking, and asset management services.\n\nThe Bitcoin Adoption Fund is designed to entice institutional investors to invest in Bitcoin. It will allow institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to hold the cryptocurrency directly. The fund is expected to attract a wide range of institutional investors, including pension funds, endowments, and family offices.\n\nNomura's move to launch a Bitcoin Adoption Fund comes as more institutional investors are showing interest in cryptocurrencies. The fund is expected to capitalize on the growing demand for Bitcoin among institutional investors. The launch of the fund is also seen as a significant step towards the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Bitcoin Adoption Fund is the latest in a series of moves by Nomura to expand its presence in the cryptocurrency market. In 2022, Nomura acquired a stake in a cryptocurrency exchange, and in 2023, it launched a cryptocurrency custody service. The launch of the Bitcoin Adoption Fund is expected to further strengthen Nomura's position in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nLaser Digital has picked Komainu as the fund's regulated custody partner. The Bitcoin Adoption Fund is a mutual fund registered in the Cayman Islands. Nomura has been an active participant in the digital asset ecosystem, establishing a digital asset venture capital arm in 2022 and acquiring a license from Dubai's Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Bitcoin price is making steady gains, heading toward the $27,000 level after bearish August.\n\nBTC holders are closely watching the Federal Reserve interest rate decision at the FOMC meeting that concludes on September 20.\n\nBitcoin price could benefit from upside volatility if there is no change in rates, but rate hike could increase selling pressure on BTC.\n\nBitcoin price action of late has fueled optimism among traders as the asset climbs toward $27,000 after a weak performance throughout August and the first two weeks of September. BTC holders are likely watching the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday closely for cues on where the asset\u2019s price is headed next.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision could act as a potential volatility driver for the asset as macroeconomic factors have had an impact on BTC prices throughout 2023.\n\nAlso read: XRP price fights risk of decline, sustains above $0.50 despite NYDFS action\n\nBitcoin price eyes $27,000 ahead of Fed rate decision\n\nBitcoin price is heading into a volatility-filled week with the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. This event is key to BTC as the US Central bank will make a decision on interest rates, a macroeconomic factor that has typically influenced the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nMarket participants do not expect the Fed to pivot from its stance on interest rates. CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool has gathered a 99% probability of no hike and a 1% probability of an increase to 5.5% to 5.75%.\n\nTarget rate probabilities for Fed\u2019s interest rate decision on September 20\n\nNo interest rate hike could result in Bitcoin price recovery gaining strength. An interest rate hike on the other hand could spring a surprise on BTC holders and increase the selling pressure on Bitcoin. Additionally, hawkish rhetoric may increase the odds of a hike later this year and thus lead to a sell-off in crypto assets.\n\nThe knee-jerk reaction in the past to interest rate hikes by the US Central bank has been a downside surprise to BTC price as market participants rapidly pull capital out of risk assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nTraders\u2019 focus will be on the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), a consensus among Fed governors for how the economy will shape up during the current calendar year and the next two years. This forecast is likely to set the tone for the rest of 2023 and help determine the direction in which BTC price is headed for the end of the year.\n\nWhales sit on the sidelines, await FOMC outcome\n\nBased on data from crypto intelligence tracker Santiment, as of Tuesday, Bitcoin\u2019s large wallet investors are sitting on the sidelines. The surge in Bitcoin address activity and the short-lived price rally in response to the US CPI report acted as volatility drivers for BTC in September.\n\nThe Whale transaction activity chart shows relatively low movement ahead of the FOMC decision.\n\nWhale transaction count vs BTC price\n\nAs the FOMC approaches, on-chain analysts at Santiment highlight the need of a catalyst to drive BTC price recovery. In the short-term, there has been an increase in profit-taking among cryptocurrencies with large market capitalization.\n\nAmong these assets, BTC has recorded the highest ratio of profit vs. loss since the first week of July. This is typically considered a warning sign of an upcoming decline in BTC. The interest rate decision by the US Federal Reserve could alleviate BTC holders\u2019 concerns,while the absence of an interest rate hike could drive the asset\u2019s price higher and aid recovery."

It\u2019s another incarnation of the \u201csocial token\u201d concept, and social finance projects like these are often billed as being a way to bring new users into the crypto space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter the recent Friend.tech surge, pseudonymous Alpha founder Punk3700 described his Bitcoin-based platform to Decrypt as \u201cthe next big leap in the world of social finance.\u201d Despite building it in a weekend, he said the project \u201caims to bring a luxurious and exclusive experience to social interactions.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, new users are joining the network every few minutes, many of which amass tens or even hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers.\n\nPunk3700 is also one of the core members behind New Bitcoin City, an ecosystem that is dabbling in art, on-chain gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and AI as a way to \u201cexplore Bitcoin beyond just a currency.\u201d\n\nAlpha is the collective's latest development\u2014but its unique tech stack isn\u2019t entirely focused on Bitcoin. According to its founder, Alpha \u201cruns a rollup that rolls up to another rollup that rolls up to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhat does that even mean? In short, it\u2019s a way of using multiple blockchain networks to create an experience that can be responsive and scalable. In this case, the project leverages a hybrid blockchain architecture with several components: Bitcoin, Ethereum scaling network Polygon, and the project\u2019s own Bitcoin scaling network called Trustless Computer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to New Bitcoin City\u2019s website, a Trustless Computer is a low-cost and speedy layer-2 blockchain built on top of Bitcoin that can support things like a decentralized exchange (DEX), tokenized communities called decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and NFT marketplaces.\n\nIt is a no-code tool that allows for developers to choose whether they want to implement Optimistic rollups or zero-knowledge rollups (zkRollups) to facilitate apps built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nAlpha\u2019s hybrid design uses Optimistic rollups as a scaling solution by moving computation and data storage off-chain from Bitcoin. It currently taps into Polygon, the Ethereum scaling network, using it for data storage\u2014although Punk3700 says data availability can eventually live 100% on Bitcoin \u201cif need be.\u201d\n\nThis is one of the differences Alpha has with Friend.tech. Built on Base, Friend.tech leverages rollups directly on Ethereum, inheriting the network\u2019s security. Alpha has to look elsewhere for solutions.\n\n\u201cRollups on Bitcoin right now aren't true rollups because Bitcoin can't verify proofs,\u201d explained Bob Bodily, CEO of Bioniq, an Ordinals marketplace that runs on a Bitcoin sidechain. Lack of verification on Bitcoin\u2019s part means a certain degree of centralization will exist.\n\nThat said, he told Decrypt that \u201cpeople don\u2019t usually wait around for full decentralization,\u201d pointing to the billions locked in layer-2 networks on Ethereum. \u201cPeople are keen to experiment with new tech.\u201d\n\nEven so, Bodily isn\u2019t sold on the answers Alpha\u2019s team provided in response to some of the concerns expressed over the project. He said he still doesn't know who owns the smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) rollups, whether they\u2019re upgradeable or immutable, and more.\n\nTokenomics also raise some enormous red flags, which the team has yet to address. According to the Trustless Computer website, the token supply is approximately $100 million TC, with 99.8% of it sitting in one address.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI've been digging in the explorer, but it's very hard to figure it all out,\u201d Bodily said.\n\nEven amid such concerns, Alpha\u2019s launch has sent a ripple of excitement throughout the Bitcoin space, much as the NFT-like Ordinals protocol and its BRC-20 token standard did earlier this year.\n\nJake Gallen, strategy lead at Emblem Vault, has been at the forefront of the launch. Emblem Vault is a tool that lets users store tokens across blockchains without need for a bridge. \u201cThere is a more authentic feel to it,\u201d Gallen told Decrypt, citing a friendlier user experience, along with the fact that \u201cthere is no point in airdrop farming.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you're building a brand, the goal is to distribute awareness across platforms,\" he concluded. \u201cJust as most people have multiple social media accounts across multiple apps, crypto users will use SocialFi on whichever blockchain they prefer.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading higher on Tuesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting outcome, where the US central bank is expected to maintain the status quo. The market dominance of Bitcoin in the crypto market has increased to about 50 per cent, which is the highest in the last 26 months.\n\n\n\nBitcoin posted mild gains as the largest crypto token rose about a per cent, nearing $27,000-levels after briefly touching it. Its largest peer, Ethereum, also inched up marginally, to firm its position above $1,600-mark. Price action in the altcoins remained on the positive side in the early hours.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has traded sideways with an upward bias in the last 24 hours. It has been another positive day for Bitcoin as it touched $27,400 before pulling back slightly, In fact, the last 8 days have been pretty positive for the crypto market with Bitcoin rebounding about 10 per cent from its recent lows, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"Other cryptos worth highlighting are Solana and Chainlink as they have been showing significant momentum ever since the market started to recover. With giants like financial service provider SWIFT using Chainlink\u2019s infrastructure, we can see a significant upside if this momentum continues,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading higher on Tuesday. Toncoin surged about 5 per cent, while Solana gained about 4 per cent. Litecoin rose over 3 per cent, whereas XRP and Cardano were up 2 per cent each. Among the losers, BNB declined about a per cent, while Polkadot and Shiba Inu also retreated.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading slightly higher, rising to $1.07 trillion-mark, as it rose about a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged more than 63 per cent to $30.13 billion.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nChainlink(LINK) serves as a blockchain abstraction layer, facilitating seamless connectivity for smart contracts across various platforms.

        "content": "Bitcoin has been trending up since hitting a local low below $25,000 on September 11th. Yesterday\u2019s rally to $27,435 marked a 10% increase from the recent low. As NewsBTC reported, the rally was largely led by the futures market and a massive increase in open interest of over $1 billion, more than half of which was flushed out when BTC fell back below $27,000. Despite this, BTC is up around 7.5% from last week\u2019s low. A reason to be bullish?\n\nGlassnode Report Sheds Light On Market Sentiment\n\nAccording to Glassnode, the Realized HODL Ratio (RHODL) serves as a crucial market sentiment indicator. It measures the balance between investments in recently moved coins (those held for less than a week) and those in the hands of longer-term HODLers (held for 1-2 years). The RHODL Ratio for the year 2023 is flirting with the 2-year median level. While this indicates a modest influx of new investors, the momentum behind this shift remains relatively weak.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s Accumulation Trend Score further elaborates on this trend. It shows that the current recovery rally of 2023 has been significantly influenced by investor FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), with noticeable accumulation patterns around local price tops exceeding $30,000. This behavior contrasts sharply with the latter half of 2022, where newer market entrants showed resilience by accumulating Bitcoin at lower price levels.\n\nThe Realized Profit and Loss indicators also reveal a complex picture. These metrics measure the value change of spent coins by comparing the acquisition price with the disposal price. In 2023, periods of intense coin accumulation were often accompanied by elevated levels of profit-taking. This pattern, which Glassnode describes as a \u201cconfluence,\u201d is similar to market behavior seen in peak periods of 2021.\n\nAn assessment of Short-Term Holders (STH) uncovers a precarious situation. A staggering majority, more than 97.5% of the supply procured by these newcomers, is currently operating at a loss, levels unseen since the infamous FTX debacle. Using the STH-MVRV and STH-SOPR metrics, which quantify the magnitude of unrealized and realized profits or losses, Glassnode elucidates the extreme financial pressures recent investors have grappled with.\n\nMarket Confidence Remains Low\n\nThe report also delves into the realm of market confidence. A close examination of the divergence between the cost basis of two investor subgroups \u2014 spenders and holders \u2014 offers an indication of prevailing market sentiment. As the market reeled from the price plummet from $29k to $26k in mid-August, an overwhelmingly negative sentiment was evident. This was manifested as the cost basis of spenders fell sharply below that of holders, a clear signal of prevalent market panic.\n\nTo offer a clearer visualization, Glassnode has normalized this metric in relation to the spot price. A crucial observation is the cyclical nature of negative sentiment during bear market recovery phases, usually lasting between 1.5 to 3.5 months. The market recently plunged into its first negative sentiment phase since 2022\u2019s conclusion.\n\nCurrently, the trend lasts 20 days, which could mean that the end has not yet been marked by the recent rally, if history repeats itself. However, if there is a sustained bounce back into positive territory, it could be indicative of renewed capital inflow, signifying a return to a more favorable stance for Bitcoin holders.\n\nIn conclusion, Glassnode\u2019s on-chain data reveals a Bitcoin market that is currently in a state of flux. Although 2023 has seen new capital entering the market, the influx lacks strong momentum. Market sentiment, especially among short-term holders, is decidedly bearish. These findings indicate that caution remains the watchword, with underlying market sentiment offering mixed signals about the sustainability of the current Bitcoin rally.\n\nAt press time, BTC traded at $26,846 after being rejected at the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level (at $27,369) in the 4-hour chart.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap was trading higher, around $1.07 trillion, rising 0.62% in the last 24 hours.\"Bitcoin's price has surged beyond the $27,000 threshold, and this upward trajectory could likely be attributed to Nomura, one of Japan's leading investment banks, unveiling a Bitcoin-based fund designed for institutional investors,\" said Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder of Mudrex.Market sentiment currently varies from neutral to bullish as market participants await the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision regarding interest rates, set to be announced later today, Edul said.The total volume in DeFi is currently $2.23 billion, 7.94% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $25.78 billion, which is 91.89% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.The market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was around $527 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 49.16%, according to CoinMarketCap.Meanwhile, BTC volume stood at approximately $14.5 billion, falling 3.86% in the last 24 hours.Bitcoin recently broke the long-term resistance at $26,800, attributed to the \u201cdouble top\u201d pattern seen in the 4-hour period. This breach also marked a successful breakout of the previous downtrend line, signaling the potential for a continued bullish trend.A dominant bullish candle on the 4-hour chart suggests strong bullish momentum with an immediate resistance or target around $27,500 and the possibility of testing $27,900 if the momentum holds. A sustained upside run could push Bitcoin to the $28,800 level and beyond.Critical support now lies at $26,800, once a resistance level, with potential secondary support at $26,300.

        "content": "What is Bitcoin Bank? Bitcoin Bank Review\n\nBitcoin Bank is one of the numerous cryptocurrency robots that operate in the cryptocurrency industry to assist those who want to invest in Bitcoin. The auto trading platform claims to use trading bots powered by AI technology to make trades with the funds you deposit into your account. This technology reportedly scans crypto exchanges and monitors market trends to find investment opportunities.\n\nThe aim of cryptocurrency trading apps such as Bitcoin Bank is to buy Bitcoin at a low price and sell it for a profit later.\n\nHowever, as the cryptocurrency market is still very volatile, Bitcoin Bank encourages you to try auto trading in a bid to open a whole new avenue of investment opportunities.\n\nThe concept behind the platform is relatively simple. On the surface, you do not need any prior knowledge of Bitcoin to start investing your money in the market. However, while the company infers that a Bitcoin investment can be life-changing, the truth is far more complicated \u2014 particularly when auto trading is concerned. For starters, this type of trading is very high-risk, especially when you cannot verify the reputability of Bitcoin Bank\u2019s partnered brokers.\n\nBitcoin Bank Overview\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Robot Type: Auto Trading Robot \ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \ud83d\ude80 Claimed Win Rate: 88% \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: None \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: None \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: None \ud83d\udcb0 Software cost: Free \u231b Withdrawal Timeframe: 24 Hours \ud83d\udcb1 Supported Cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, XRP \ud83d\udcb2 Supported Fiats: USD, EUR, GBP \ud83d\udcca Leverage: 1000:1 \ud83d\udcf1 Native Mobile App: No \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Free Demo Account: Yes \ud83c\udfa7 Customer Support: Email, Live chat \u2705 Verification required: KYC \ud83d\udd01 Automated Trading: Yes \ud83d\udcc8 CFD Available Yes\n\nPros and Cons of Using Bitcoin Bank\n\nPros Low deposit of $250\n\nDemo account and video tutorials available\n\nNo service charges\n\nAvailable in countries that allow Bitcoin trading\n\n24/7 customer support Cons Withdrawing funds is difficult\n\nAuto trading bots are very risky\n\nSome testimonials and reviews are fake\n\nWho is Behind Bitcoin Bank?\n\nThe Bitcoin Bank team allegedly consists of professional traders and experienced software developers. We couldn't find the specific names of the owners, however.\n\nGetting Started With Bitcoin Bank\n\nBitcoin Bank is user-friendly and designed to be used by both new entrants and experienced traders in the crypto market. Take a look below at our brief overview of how to start. Remember, the bot is connected to regulated brokers, so ensure you choose the broker best-suited to your needs before starting.\n\nRegister for a trading account Deposit funds with your broker Customize your parameters and start to trade\n\nBitcoin Bank Markets, Assets, and Options\n\nWhat cryptocurrencies and products can you trade using Bitcoin Bank?\n\nThis trading robot is specifically tailored for digital assets, meaning you can\u2019t use it for assets like forex, stocks, commodities, etc. Therefore, if you want to diversify your portfolio with assets from different markets, consider other bots. For traders and investors in the crypto market, Bitcoin Bank offers trading options for some of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the crypto market. These include:\n\nWhat leverage trading options are there with Bitcoin Bank?\n\nDuring our research for this review, we could not find any conclusive information on the leverage trading options on the Bitcoin Bank platform. However, if the service is like other auto traders, you should expect potential leverages of 1000:1. While this may seem like an enticing proposition, most regulated brokers would never offer such massive leverage options. Trading with high leverage carries high risk, as it will increase your losses, as well as your profits.\n\nIf you want to know more about leveraged trading, take a look at our comprehensive guides:\n\nWhat are the spreads on Bitcoin Bank?\n\nDue to the volatility of the Bitcoin market, you can expect the buying and selling price of cryptocurrency to fluctuate every day. That being said, different brokers will offer you different spreads, all of which will have varying pip values.\n\nFees, Limits, and Payment Options on Bitcoin Bank\n\nHow Much Does Bitcoin Bank Cost?\n\nBesides offering free trade automation services, Bitcoin Bank has deposit bonuses you can enjoy from time to time. Signing up for an account is also free, and there are no subscription charges. You should test it out via its demo account to ensure it aligns with your trading or investment requirements.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Software cost: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Subscription cost: Zero\n\nWhat are the payment methods accepted by Bitcoin Bank?\n\nThere are several alternative payment methods for trading on this platform. These include:\n\nPayPal\n\nMastercard\n\nVisa\n\nAnd more\n\nDoes Bitcoin Bank also charge fees and commissions?\n\nAs we have stated in this Bitcoin Bank review, it does not charge any registration fees when you become a user. Also, you will not face any service charges when you place your initial deposit into your account. However, you can expect the platform to take a small commission of your profits - if you are lucky enough to make any.\n\nBitcoin Bank trade sizes and limits\n\nLike many other auto crypto traders, Bitcoin Bank has set a minimum deposit limit of $250 to purchase cryptocurrency. Interestingly, the platform offers zero information on the maximum trading limit. As such, you can assume that you can invest as much as you like. However, as we have said in this Bitcoin Bank review, auto trading is an unreliable way to invest in Bitcoin and comes with plenty of risks. Therefore, if you are thinking of using an auto trader, we strongly advise keeping to the minimum deposit limit.\n\nBitcoin Bank Platform\n\nHow does Bitcoin Bank work?\n\nThis is an auto trading system that reportedly utilizes AI technology to invest user funds into the Bitcoin market in the hopes of generating returns.\n\nBitcoin Bank claims to use AI bots to find cheap Bitcoin. Then the platform will prompt you to invest in those coins, or if you have selected the auto trade setting, it will purchase the coins for you. Bitcoin Bank will then hold these investments and prompt you when to sell. Sounds easy, right? Well, it also sounds too good to be true. Auto trading is undeniably risky and often ineffective, which means you are likely to lose your money rather than earn a profit.\n\nOn the Bitcoin Bank website, they suggest that your auto trading investments can have numerous benefits on your life, but we could not find many trustworthy testimonials or reviews that supported these claims. While the bots could scour the crypto market much faster than human crypto traders, we would not wholly trust them to help you earn a profit. There is a good chance you will not see a return on your investment given the nature of auto trading.\n\nWhat devices can I use Bitcoin Bank on?\n\nYou can use this platform on any device with a browser that can connect to the internet. This includes:\n\nSmartphones\n\nTablets\n\nDesktops\n\nLaptops\n\nCan I Use Bitcoin Bank in My Country?\n\nCountry Is Bitcoin Bank available? United Kingdom No Canada No Australia Yes USA No South Africa Yes New Zealand Yes Philippines Yes United Arab Emirates Yes Singapore Yes France Yes Spain Yes Italy Yes Germany Yes Nigeria Yes Mexico Yes\n\nWhich exchanges and brokers does Bitcoin Bank partner with?\n\nUnfortunately, we found it difficult to find any concrete information regarding the brokers and exchanges partnered with Bitcoin Bank. That being said, you should remember that high leverage rates are a strong indicator that brokers are probably unregulated and, therefore, less likely to help you earn a profit.\n\nIs Bitcoin Bank available in my language?\n\nBitcoin Bank is available in numerous languages. Unfortunately, the language will be automatically assigned to you based on your geographical location. You can expect to view Bitcoin Bank in:\n\nEnglish\n\nGerman\n\nSpanish\n\nItalian\n\nand more\n\nHow easy is it to use Bitcoin Bank?\n\nRegarding the app itself, Bitcoin Bank is straightforward to navigate. The user interface is relatively minimal and sleek. Account registration is speedy, but that is probably because the company wants you to deposit your funds and get trading. If you are confused by the Bitcoin Bank platform, you can use a demo account to practice making trades without spending any real money.\n\nHow much profit can you make using Bitcoin Bank?\n\nThe amount of profit you could make depends on factors such as how much you trade with and the conditions in the market. Profits aren't guaranteed, however, and you could easily lose your capital.\n\nBitcoin Bank Key Features\n\nBitcoin Bank offers numerous features on the platform to stand out to new users. These include:\n\nCustomer Support\n\nIn preparation for this review, we found that the customer support side of Bitcoin Bank is very attentive. When you create your account, you\u2019ll be contacted by a representative immediately to finalize your registration. If you miss their call, you can expect them to try your number repeatedly until you complete the sign-up process. You can also contact Bitcoin Bank by e-mail or live chat.\n\nLow Deposit\n\nOne of the most advertised Bitcoin Bank features is their low minimum deposit of $250. This makes the bot accessible to a wide range of potential investors.\n\nDemo Account\n\nAs we have already stated, Bitcoin Bank allows you to try out a demo version of the app, which has all the features of the live trading crypto experience, but you do not use your funds, eliminating any risk.\n\nBitcoin Bank Security and Regulation\n\nIs Bitcoin Bank legit?\n\nWe found plenty of Bitcoin Bank review sites online during our research, though many of them were obvious fabrications designed to direct traffic towards the site. Also, the high-leverage options make you wonder how many Bitcoin Bank partnered brokers are regulated. In our experience, regulated brokers and exchanges do not offer astronomical leverage options.\n\nThere have also been some reports that Bitcoin Bank makes it very difficult to withdraw your funds. Details can be found here.\n\nIs Bitcoin Bank safe?\n\nBitcoin Bank is technically safe in regards to your personal information being protected by SSL encryption. However, due to the issues surrounding the problematic withdrawal process and the large amount of risk involved with leveraged trades, we cannot guarantee safety.\n\nAre my money and I protected?\n\nOverall, Bitcoin Bank is highly encrypted and aims to ensure your email and data are protected from hackers\u2019 access.\n\nIs Bitcoin Bank regulated?\n\nThis is difficult to say. We found little information regarding regulated exchanges and brokers on the Bitcoin Bank website. However, as we have stated, we recommend that you avoid any broker that offers obscenely high leverage on your deposit, as they will most likely be unregulated. The best crypto trader regulators are the CySec, FCA, ASIC, and FSB - look for any of these authorities before conducting business with any platform.\n\nDo I have to verify my account with Bitcoin Bank?\n\nYes, when you create your account, you\u2019ll need to provide documents and verify your identity and address. Then you can use your Bitcoin Bank login.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Bank Work? Trading Strategies and Algorithms\n\nBitcoin Bank is AI-powered, using trading signals and algorithms to monitor the cryptocurrency market and trade on your behalf based on potentially profitable market trends it identifies. The robot is designed for high-speed performance. Bitcoin Bank has a claimed win rate of 88% and like any trading product doesn't guarantee successful trades. It does, however, improve trading efficiency through the following strategies and tools.\n\nAutomated Trading Tools\n\nArbitrage Trading\n\nReactive News Trading\n\nPrice Trend Analysis\n\nExtra Information About Bitcoin Bank\n\nEducational Resources\n\nTraders and crypto investors can learn more about cryptocurrency trading from website blogs, podcasts, and YouTube channels. All these resources are free, but you can pay for financial advisors\u2019 services should you require extra guidance.\n\nBitcoin Bank comes with plenty of charts and metrics to show you the Bitcoin market projections. You can also set parameters to customize your trading experience.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nBitcoin Bank Customer Support Details Bitcoin Bank support email Not available Bitcoin Bank support contact number Not available Bitcoin Bank live chat option Yes Bitcoin Bank other support options Online Form\n\nDemo Account\n\nBitcoin Bank has a demo account to try out the platform and gauge your skill level before venturing into the live market using real money. The demo account is risk-free, but you must make a minimum deposit of $250 to use it. This is a good way to get started, especially if you are entering the crypto space with zero experience.\n\nHow to get started with Bitcoin Bank? 3 simple steps\n\nBelow you\u2019ll find instructions to help you get started with Bitcoin Bank:\n\nRegistration Registration is a relatively quick and painless process. Simply input your details, and you\u2019ll be contacted by a representative who will see you through the verification procedure. Make a Deposit Once you have created your Bitcoin Bank account, you need to pay a deposit of $250 to trade Bitcoin. You can deposit more funds if you prefer, though we strongly recommend that you stick to the minimum. Begin to Live Trade If you\u2019ve completed the above steps, you are ready to start trading crypto on Bitcoin Bank. Remember to set parameters such as stop losses, and you can always try things out in the demo version first.\n\nHow to Delete Your Bitcoin Bank Account?\n\nTo delete your account, go to Bitcoin Bank's menu at the top corner of the page and access the settings command to initiate the process. Alternatively, you can delete your Bitcoin Bank account by deleting your account with the broker, thus losing your data with that broker as well. You can contact Bitcoin Bank's customer care for guidance.\n\nHow to Withdraw Money From Bitcoin Bank?\n\nBitcoin Bank does not have a cryptocurrency wallet for storing your assets and earnings. The brokers it is connected with do the storing, meaning that your funds can only be accessed through the brokers. Below is the procedure for withdrawing your money from a partnered broker.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Bank\u2019s connected broker\u2019s platform and sign into your trading/investment account Go to your wallet, where you should click withdraw to start the withdrawal process Enter your preferred payment method, such as PayPal or bank transfer Enter an amount to withdraw Click continue to initiate the withdrawal process, which should take up to 24 hours to complete\n\nRemember, most cryptocurrency brokers do not process payouts in crypto assets, and that is why Bitcoin Bank supports various fiat currencies to streamline the withdrawal process. Therefore, choose your preferred fiat currency to successfully withdraw your funds.\n\nBitcoin Bank Celebrity/Company Endorsements\n\nYou may have come across online reviews claiming that top celebrities or companies endorse Bitcoin Bank. We did our research to verify these claims, and below are our opinions based on our findings.\n\nIs Elon Musk Related to Bitcoin Bank?\n\nNo. Elon Musk is a Bitcoin investor and the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX.

He is Amazon\u2019s founder and has no interest in cryptocurrency trading and investments.

        "content": "Bitcoin halving countdown is on \u2013 will crypto prices rise?\n\nNew Bitcoin \u2018halving countdown clocks\u2019 are popping up everywhere online again as the crypto community looks ahead to the next halving event, which is most likely, say experts, going to happen between April and May 2024.\n\nBitcoin halving is a programmed event that occurs approximately every four years, reducing the rewards miners receive for validating transactions by half.\n\nThe halving happens every 210,000 blocks. The 2024 halving will happen on block 840,000.\n\nI believe that the cryptocurrency\u2019s price will experience a significant surge in the run-up to this next halving event. Here\u2019s why.\n\nFirst, with each halving, the rate at which new Bitcoins are created decreases. This supply reduction is akin to a rare and predictable event in the world of traditional assets.\n\nBasic economic principles suggest that when supply diminishes and demand remains strong, prices tend to rise. As we draw nearer to the 2024 halving, investors can anticipate this supply reduction, driving up demand for Bitcoin.\n\nSecond, when we examine the history of Bitcoin halvings, a clear pattern emerges. Both the 2012 and 2016 halvings were followed by significant price rallies.\n\nThis historical precedent has established a strong expectation within the crypto community that the 2024 halving will produce similar results. The anticipation of a price surge often leads to increased buying activity in the lead-up to the event, which, again, would likely contribute to a substantial price increase.\n\nThird, the cryptocurrency market has come a long way since its early days. It has matured and gained greater acceptance among institutional investors and the general public.\n\nLarge financial institutions, including hedge funds and asset management companies, have begun to allocate significant capital to Bitcoin. This growing institutional interest lends greater credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class and suggests that more capital will flow into the market as the 2024 halving approaches.\n\nFourth, Bitcoin\u2019s digital scarcity, with a maximum supply capped at 21 million coins, makes it an attractive asset to hedge against inflation.\n\nAs major economies continue to grapple with economic uncertainty and rising inflation rates, investors are increasingly seeking alternative assets like Bitcoin to preserve their wealth. This influx of capital into Bitcoin as a hedge would drive up its price in the months leading up to the halving.\n\nThousands of Bitcoiners held parties in cities across the world to celebrate the 2016 halving, and I imagine there will be more at next year\u2019s event.\n\nMany more savvy investors will likely be quietly celebrating already in anticipation of a possible price surge in the run-up."

        "title": "How bitcoin is revolutionizing cross-border transactions - Business Insider Africa",
        "content": "Funds movement between nations or cross-border remittances is vital to the global economy. Many people depend on the funds they receive from foreign business partners and relatives.\n\nTraditionally, people have relied on conventional remittance options, including transaction delays and high fees. However, Bitcoin is revolutionizing cross-border transactions due to its decentralized and borderless nature. This blog post explains how this cryptocurrency changes how people transact across borders.\n\nAdvantages of Using Bitcoin in Cross-border Transactions\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBitcoin users benefit from using it in cross-border transactions in several ways. Here are some of the reasons to use this cryptocurrency in international payments.\n\nImproved Transaction Speed\n\nBitcoin allows individuals to complete cross-border transfers almost immediately. Conventional financial service providers like banks take days or weeks to settle an international transaction. However, miners confirm a Bitcoin transaction within minutes. And it doesn\u2019t matter the recipient\u2019s or the sender\u2019s location. Bitcoin expedites financial transactions, which is vital in time-sensitive or critical circumstances.\n\nLow Transaction Costs\n\nMany people prefer Bitcoin over conventional payment methods because it\u2019s relatively cheaper. Completing a cryptocurrency transaction costs a small amount or nothing. Therefore, people can save money when sending money abroad or receiving it from foreign senders when using Bitcoin.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFinancial Inclusivity\n\nThe traditional financial system has locked many people out of the banking system, especially in developing countries. That\u2019s because they lack the necessary infrastructure or do not qualify to open bank accounts. Bitcoin gives the underbanked and unbanked access to various financial services. Anybody with a smartphone that accesses the internet can set up a digital wallet and use it to complete financial transactions. Also, platforms like immediate alpha enable individuals to access and use Bitcoin in international trade.\n\nEnhanced Security\n\nMany people fear transacting internationally due to their exposure to fraud. For instance, some merchants fear engaging in global trade with payment methods like credit cards due to chargebacks. However, Bitcoin provides secure transactions due to its underlying technology. Blockchain protects Bitcoin users against transaction manipulation, fraud, and unauthorized funds access. Blockchain records all Bitcoin transactions on a transparent, unchangeable digital ledger. And this builds trust while increasing accountability.\n\nChallenges\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile Bitcoin brings numerous benefits to cross-border remittances, it has its drawbacks. Here are the primary challenges of using this cryptocurrency in cross-border transactions.\n\nDiffering Regulations\n\nBitcoin is legal in some countries, meaning citizens can use it in cross-border transactions. However, other nations strictly regulate and control Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Some have even banned Bitcoin use, mining, and trading. Therefore, individuals and organizations that want to use Bitcoin to transact internationally may need help in countries where Bitcoin is illegal.\n\nVolatility\n\nBitcoin and other virtual currencies are highly volatile. Their prices can fluctuate rapidly within a short period. Therefore, determining the amount you\u2019ll receive in fiat money when cashing out Bitcoin can be challenging. You can lose money if Bitcoin\u2019s value drops or make a profit if it increases. Therefore, volatility is among the primary challenge for Bitcoin use in international payments.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLimited Knowledge\n\nSome people are yet to understand Bitcoin and how it functions. Some think it\u2019s a digital asset, while others see it as a currency. Also, some people need more time to understand crypto wallets and how to use private and public keys to receive and safeguard their Bitcoins. Until more people understand Bitcoin and its functioning, its use in cross-border transactions will remain limited.\n\nParting Shot\n\nBitcoin is transforming cross-border transactions. This virtual currency eliminates intermediaries, enabling users to send funds faster and affordably. Additionally, Bitcoin is straightforward due to the low entrance barrier since you can use it without opening a bank account. Thus, anybody with a smartphone can use it to set up a crypto wallet and transact with Bitcoin internationally. Nevertheless, challenges like volatility, ambiguous laws, and limited knowledge delay its adoption in cross-border transactions.\n\n--\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and the promising newcomer, Kangamoon (KANG) \u2013 may also experience significant surges.\n\nSummary\n\nShiba Inu positions itself for strong growth\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nKangamoon projected to dominate the P2E NFT gaming market\n\nDon\u2019t Miss Out On The Kangamoon (KANG) Presale \u2013 Reserve Your Spot!\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): Strong Growth Potential\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) has made waves with its charismatic branding and an ever-growing community of supporters.\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF could further legitimize cryptocurrencies in the eyes of institutional investors and the general public. As a result, the broader crypto market, including meme coins like Shiba Inu, might experience increased attention and investment.\n\nThe strong community backing and exciting developments, such as Shibaswap 2.0 and the TREAT reward token, position the Shiba Inu coin for potential growth. Not only that, experts remain bullish for the Shiba Inu coin. In fact, they forecast that the Shiba Inu price will sit between $0.00000946 and $0.00001078 within Q4 of 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH): A Crypto Giant\n\nEthereum (ETH) has always been pivotal in the crypto ecosystem. If a Bitcoin ETF gains approval, it could set a precedent for further cryptocurrency ETFs, potentially including Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s significance lies in its smart contract capabilities and vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). An ETF approval could bring fresh investment into the Ethereum network, supporting its ongoing upgrades. Thus driving further Ethereum adoption.\n\nRegarding Ethereum price predictions, market analysts forecast that the value will surge to $2,335.71 by the end of 2023.\n\nKangamoon (KANG): A Meme Coin With a Unique Twist\n\nKangamoon (KANG) will be a newcomer who brings an innovative twist to meme coins. This upcoming project aims to merge gaming and cryptocurrency, offering a unique play-to-earn experience. If a Bitcoin ETF receives the green light, it could surge Kangamoon interest as well.\n\nIt takes its inspiration from the world of memes and infuses it with the adrenaline-pumping world of boxing. At the heart of this crypto sensation is Kangamoon, a spirited kangaroo with an insatiable passion for boxing. Taking on the role of Kangamoon, players embark on an all-immersive journey where they can fight with players from all over the globe.\n\nWhat sets Kangamoon apart is its commitment to the play-to-earn concept. In the Kangamoon gaming universe, players can earn virtual currency and rare in-game items through their skills and dedication. Winning matches and participating in special events are all avenues to accumulating rewards, which can be sold or traded on its marketplace.\n\nIn sum, Kangamoon will be fresh air in the crypto space. Currently, one KANG native token costs only $0.005. Unlike Shiba Inu and Ethereum, KANG taps into the gaming market (seeing $200B in yearly revenue as per Newzoo). Thus, its long-term growth potential is outstanding. As a result, market analysts predict a 22x value growth before its presale finishes.\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Kangamoon (KANG) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://Kangamoon.com/\n\nJoin Our Telegram Community: https://t.me/Kangamoonofficial\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The absence of a specific procedure rule requiring a paying party\u2019s name and address in costs assessment proceedings does not permit the party to conceal their identity from the court, an appeal judge has ruled.\n\nIn Persons Unknown v Wright - the latest in a series of judgments concerning the self-proclaimed inventor of bitcoin - the Honourable Mr Justice Richard Smith dismissed an appeal brought by 'C\u00f8bra', the pseudonymous operator of the bitcoin.org website, over the right to challenge a costs bill of \u00a3569,000. The High Court ruled last year that 'C\u00f8bra' is not entitled to take part in proceedings over a copyright dispute even with legal representation.\n\n'C\u00f8bra' had intended to challenge a default judgment in a claim brought by computer scientist Dr Craig Wright for infringing copyright in the 2008 'Satoshi' white paper which launched the bitcoin peer-to-peer digital cash system.\n\nThe latest appeal, at which C\u00f8bra was represented by Erica Bedford, instructed by Mackenzie Costs Limited, relied partly on the point that no requirement for the paying party's name to be stated appears in Part 47 of the Civil Procedure Rules and the related practice direction. Finding this omission 'unremarkable', Smith observed: 'Although comprehensive, the CPR do not purport to be an exhaustive code as to the conduct of proceedings, nor do they purport to address every specific situation that might arise.'\n\nWright's legal team, Shaman Kapoor, instructed by Travers Smith LLP, commented that the appeal was the first time that the English court has been asked on appeal to determine whether a party has the right to participate in assessment proceedings whilst maintaining their anonymity both to the court and to the opposing party.\n\nWright commented that allowing such anonymity would amount to an attack on the principle of open justice. 'This is a core component of the rule of law and generally requires justice to be administered in public,' he said. 'C\u00f8bra has shown flagrant disregard towards these important principles and now pays the price.\u2019\n\nWright's claim to be 'Satoshi' is expected to be tested in a High Court case scheduled for January and February next year."

Most of the consolidated data used in this story was provided by Arkham Intelligence and the Buy Bitcoin Worldwide website.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto holdings (estimations): 750,000 to 1.1 million BTC Binance holdings: 643,546 BTC Grayscale holdings: 627,779 BTC US Government holdings: 207,189 BTC Mt. Gox holdings: 200,000 BTC Bitfinex holdings: 196,252 BTC China Government holdings: 194,000 BTC MicroStrategy holdings: 152,800 BTC Block.one holdings: 140,000 BTC Robinhood holdings: 118,300 BTC\n\nTogether, these top 10 Bitcoin holders have 3,479,866 (3.48 million) BTC. Accounting for 16.5% of the maximum supply of 21 million BTC, or 17.8% of the current circulating supply of 19.49 million BTC, by press time.\n\nBitcoin circulating supply on September 19, 2023. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nBitcoin holdings by the top 5 largest known entities explained\n\nNotably, it is impossible to know the exact amount of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin holdings, but the above estimations are the most accepted by renowned researchers, according to BTC mining data from the early days, suggesting the creator of Bitcoin was able to mine around 22,000 blocks.\n\nWhile Binance is the second largest holder, its holdings are mostly made of third-party ownership using the centralized exchange to custody their coins that are ready to be traded. Grayscale holdings are mostly made of reserves for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), with the on-chain proofs recently revealed by Arkham.\n\nAccording to Forbes, the United States Bitcoin holdings are mostly made of seized assets from regulatory crackdowns against businesses, or from criminal activities such as hackings, financial fraudulent schemes, and money laundering activities.\n\nMt. Gox is probably one of the most monitored Bitcoin holders in history, as the remaining stash is locked by a Tokyo Court ruling on the Mt. Gox case, which will supposedly be used to pay the crashed exchange\u2019s creditors. With recurrent delays and speculation about when they will be released for a possible sell-off."

        "title": "Mark Yusko predicts a \"parabolic top\" for Bitcoin price with $300 billion after the advent of the ETF - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The founder of Morgan Creek Capital, recently had his say on the possibility of a parabolic rise in the price of Bitcoin in succession to the approval of ETFs.\n\nMorgan Creek Capital founder and his hypothesis on the price of Bitcoin once ETFs are approved\n\nIn the ever-changing cryptocurrency landscape, Bitcoin has consistently proven to be the pioneer and leader. Mark Yusko, founder of Morgan Creek Capital, recently shared his insights on the future of Bitcoin in an interview with Paul Barron Network.\n\nAccording to Yusko, Bitcoin is poised for a parabolic rise, led by an institutional capital inflow of hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nWe delve into Yusko\u2019s analysis, the significance of Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycle and the potential impact of ETF approval on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe halving cycle and the price trajectory of Bitcoin\n\nYusko\u2019s analysis begins with an examination of Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycle, a crucial event that occurs every four years.\n\nDuring this event, the rewards given to Bitcoin miners are halved, reducing the rate at which new Bitcoin is generated.\n\nThe next halving is scheduled for April 2024. Yusko highlights an intriguing pattern observed in Bitcoin\u2019s price history: after each halving, Bitcoin tends to add a zero to its price.\n\nFor example, after the first halving, the price went from $100 to $1,000.\n\nSubsequently, after the second halving, it rose from $1,000 to $10,000.\n\nAccording to this pattern, the next logical step would be to reach a fair value of $100,000. Currently trading at $26,000, Bitcoin appears to be on a rapid trajectory toward this fair value.\n\nThe parabolic Blow-Off Top phenomenon\n\nWhat makes Yusko\u2019s analysis particularly interesting, however, is his mention of the \u201cparabolic top,\u201d which tends to occur after each half-life cycle.\n\nIn the previous cycle, Bitcoin\u2019s fair value was estimated at around $30,000, but it eventually rose to $69,000.\n\nThis dramatic increase was largely attributed to excessive leverage, speculative trading, and rampant gambling in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nYusko, however, offers a more conservative estimate for the current cycle.\n\nHe suggests that instead of seeing a 2 or 2.5-fold increase, Bitcoin could experience a 1.5-fold surge this time around. This is indicative of a more cautious and calculated approach by investors and market participants.\n\nThe role of Bitcoin ETFs as catalysts for the price increase\n\nOne of the key catalysts that Yusko believes will drive Bitcoin\u2019s rise is the potential approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Bitcoin.\n\nHe predicts that these ETFs could gain regulatory approval by late 2023 or early 2024. Once this is achieved, it could pave the way for a massive influx of capital into the cryptocurrency space.\n\nYusko\u2019s estimate is bold: He predicts that about $300 billion in capital could flow into Bitcoin after the approval of a spot ETF.\n\nThis influx of capital could be a game changer, as a significant portion of Bitcoin\u2019s supply is held by long-term investors or remains dormant.\n\nThe combination of increased demand and limited supply could push the price of Bitcoin to unprecedented levels.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, Mark Yusko\u2019s analysis presents an interesting perspective on the future of Bitcoin. His observation of Bitcoin\u2019s historical price patterns following halving events, along with the potential impact of ETF approval, offers valuable insights for investors and enthusiasts.\n\nAlthough the cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile and unpredictable, Yusko\u2019s assessment suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s journey to new heights may be well underway, thanks to institutional investment and a cautious market approach.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency space continues to evolve, only time will tell if his predictions come true."

        "content": "If someone asked you how many blocks (or minutes) they should wait to make sure their Bitcoin (BTC) transaction is irreversible, would you know what to say? The \u201crule of thumb\u201d would be between three to six blocks (around 30 to 60 minutes), but experts say it should be even more.\n\nDifferent people could give different answers, and a recent post by Luke Dash Jr. (@LukeDashjr) \u2014 a Bitcoin Core developer \u2014 on X suggests that a 12-block waiting (around 120 minutes) is the safer approach, considering Bitcoin mining\u2018s current state.\n\nIndeed, probably should wait a good 12 blocks now \u2014 Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) September 19, 2023\n\nWith that in mind, Finbold went deeper into understanding what is the safer confirmation time for a Bitcoin transaction.\n\nBitcoin transactions have probabilistic finality\n\nDue to Bitcoin having what is called \u2018probabilistic finality\u2019, transactions\u2019 irreversibility increases for each new block added to the blockchain after the block that included the transaction.\n\nWhen someone sends BTC from one address to another \u2014 which could be depositing BTC to a centralized exchange in order to sell \u2014 the Bitcoin transaction sits in a mempool, waiting for the next miner to find a block and include this sending there, before broadcasting this block to the network, that will be added to the blockchain.\n\nHowever, according to the Bitcoin whitepaper, if another miner spends more hashrate and broadcasts a block with the same block height, the first block could be invalidated, as Bitcoin nodes would follow the chain with the highest work (hashrate) put into it.\n\nEach new block broadcasted after the first increases the work put into this given chain, which makes it harder for the block sequence to be invalidated. Probabilistic increasing irreversibility of all the transactions that were validated by this sequence, or chain.\n\nWhy does Bitcoin confirmation time need to increase?\n\nAnother renowned Bitcoin contributor, Jameson Lopp, wrote an article called \u201cHow Many Bitcoin Confirmations is Enough\u201d, addressing all the technical and mathematical aspects that answer this question.\n\nAccording to Lopp, the needed confirmation time for a 99.9% certainty of irreversibility increases according to the percentage of a theoretical attacker would have from the network\u2019s hashrate. Going from 5 blocks (50 minutes) for a 10% hashrate, to 340 blocks (over 56 hours) for a 45% hashrate.\n\n% Attacker Global Hashrate vs # Confs for 99.9% Certainty. Source: Jameson Lopp\n\nNotably, this aligns with the answer Luke Dash Jr. gave about the 12 confirmations needed considering that two Bitcoin mining pools already have over 20% of the global hashrate. These are Foundry USA and Antpool, with 29.67% and 22.75% of the total hashrate in the last month, respectively.\n\nBitcoin mining pools 1-month hashrate ranking. Source: mempool.space\n\nTherefore, the recommended waiting time will vary depending on the state of the network but also on the risk tolerance of the receiving part. Some centralized exchanges have chosen to wait for three blocks depending on the deposit size, while others require four, five, or even six blocks \u2014 each block having an average interval of 10 minutes."

To ensure maximum security and regulatory compliance, Nomura has chosen Komainu as its trusted custody partner.\n\nThis Bitcoin fund operates under the umbrella of Laser Digital Funds Segregated Portfolio Company, having successfully registered as a mutual fund under the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands Regulatory Authority.\n\nSebastien Guglietta, head of Laser Digital Asset Management, rightly pointed out the transformative potential of Bitcoin. He noted that Bitcoin stands as a catalyst for a profound and lasting paradigm shift in the financial world.\n\nLong-term exposure to Bitcoin, facilitated by the Bitcoin Adoption Fund, offers institutional investors a means to capitalize on this far-reaching macroeconomic trend.\n\nAlthough this is Nomura\u2019s first foray into a fund dedicated to Bitcoin adoption, the financial giant has long been actively engaged in the digital asset ecosystem.\n\nBack in September 2022, the institution launched its venture capital arm for digital assets, positioning itself at the forefront of digital innovation.\n\nIn addition, in August of the same year, Nomura\u2019s crypto arm, Laser Digital, secured the coveted Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) license to operate in Dubai, further consolidating its global presence.\n\nJapan follows the entire world when it comes to Bitcoin adoption\n\nNomura\u2019s venture into the long-only Bitcoin Adoption Fund aligns with a broader trend of regulated financial giants exploring Bitcoin-based investment products.\n\nIn the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted approval for two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Bitcoin futures, underscoring the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in traditional financial markets.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that the decision on Bitcoin spot ETFs remains pending. Meanwhile, regions such as Canada and Europe have also given the green light to several Bitcoin-focused investment products in recent years.\n\nNews: a deeper dive into Nomura\u2019s Bitcoin Adoption Fund\n\nThe Bitcoin Adoption Fund, created by Nomura\u2019s digital asset subsidiary, Laser Digital Asset Management, is no ordinary investment vehicle. It was meticulously designed to offer institutional investors a vehicle for long-only exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nThis strategic choice is in line with the idea that Bitcoin, as a store of digital value, is an attractive asset class for long-term investment strategies.\n\nTo safeguard the digital assets held within the fund, Nomura entrusted Komainu with custodial responsibility.\n\nKomainu\u2019s reputation for robust security protocols and regulatory compliance makes it a logical choice for such a critical role.\n\nIn addition, the Bitcoin Adoption Fund operates under the Laser Digital Funds Segregated Portfolio Company, a registered mutual fund supervised by the Cayman Islands Regulatory Authority, which ensures transparency and regulatory compliance.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Nomura\u2019s launch of the Bitcoin Adoption Fund marks a pivotal moment in the integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial landscape.\n\nWith its esteemed reputation and large assets, Nomura\u2019s endorsement of Bitcoin as a long-term investment option speaks volumes about the evolving perception of digital assets within the institutional investment community.\n\nIf this trend continues to gain momentum, it could pave the way for further innovation and adoption within cryptocurrencies, opening new avenues for investors and ushering in a new era of financial diversification."
