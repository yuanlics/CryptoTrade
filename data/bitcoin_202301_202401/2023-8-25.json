        "title": "The 'Budget Ryan Reynolds' Taking Bitcoin FC to the Big Leagues - WIRED",
        "content": "A melt, a muppet, a fraud, a bungler, a Judas, a taker of bribes. A good boy, a lad, a maestro, a beauty. To the crowd at Real Bedford Football Club on a sun-bleached evening in August, the referee was all of these things within the span of half an hour. The Bedford fans, separated from the soccer field by a crooked metal railing and about a meter, held a running dialog with the players throughout the game: \u201cNumber 3! Number 3!\u201d shouted Simon, one especially vocal supporter, \u201cThat was a fucking exquisite touch!\u201d Number 3 returned a knowing grin and a thumbs up.\n\nThis is nonleague, semiprofessional English soccer: the ninth rung of the national ladder, where players are paid tens of pounds per week, not tens of thousands, and matches attract at best a few hundred spectators. The regulars know one another well\u2014they live and mostly work nearby. The game was a replay of an earlier match against F.C. Clacton, from a coastal town 100 miles away, the winner of which would go on to the next round of the FA Cup, the oldest and most prestigious knock-out tournament in England. The previous encounter had ended in a large-scale brawl and a 2-2 tie.\n\nSoccer at this level is rarely glamorous, but Real Bedford\u2019s new owner and chair, Peter McCormack, has the grand ambition of taking the club to the Premier League, the top flight of English soccer. McCormack, who took over the club in April 2022, made his money first in advertising, then by investing in Bitcoin and producing Bitcoin-related content. He is a prominent member of the cryptocurrency community, courtesy of his podcast, What Bitcoin Did, and his plan is to parlay his standing in the crypto world into an international fanbase and lucrative sponsorship for Real Bedford.\n\nThis match, like all home games, is being streamed live on YouTube. The club has set up fan groups across the globe\u2014from Ghana and Tanzania to China and Cambodia. The club badge and shirts bear the Bitcoin logo, in an attempt to turn it into something for all Bitcoiners to rally behind. And big-name sponsors have followed, like Gemini, the crypto exchange run by the Winklevoss twins.\n\nRags to riches stories are few and far between in English soccer, and the blending of crypto and sports has previously led to hostilities between clubs and their fans. But McCormack is confident that this time will be different, and he\u2019s taking a decidedly hands-on approach to prove it.\n\nMcCormack had agreed to host me at the match, but it soon became clear he wouldn\u2019t be able to complete our first interview. Three hours before kickoff, he was busy laying out merch, curating the changing room playlist, and shuttling boxes of gear from the trunk of his car. Later, I squeezed in a few questions while he was marshaling the car park, but the rest would have to wait. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You ask someone else to do something, they won\u2019t do it properly,\u201d he said over his shoulder, as he jogged off to intercept another wayward driver."

Solana\u2019s SOL was the day\u2019s biggest loser, failing to capitalize on Thursday\u2019s rally fueled by its partnership announcement with e-commerce firm Shopify on Thursday.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin falls below US$26,000 following Evergrande\u2019s bankruptcy\n\nSOL erases Shopify boost\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token fell 4.69% in the 24 hours to 4:30 in Hong Kong to US$20.67, as the day\u2019s biggest loser in the top 10, giving up most of the gains made Thursday, when Solana announced a partnership with Shopify to offer crypto payments via Solana Pay, a peer-to-peer payments protocol built on the blockchain.\n\nThe XRP token was the day\u2019s second biggest loser in the top 10, falling 3.18% to US$0.5115, which marks a six-week low for the coin, reversing nearly all the progress made since Ripple\u2019s partial victory over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month.\n\nBitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia at US$26,098 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after briefly dipping US$25,966 earlier in the day.\n\nThe world\u2019s first cryptocurrency has been weighed down by numerous factors, including large holders selling during a low-liquidity period, according to Alex Konanykhin, the chief executive officer and founder of Unicoin, an equity-backed crypto that pays dividends.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is inherently volatile. Its price can be driven down by negative news or by a large sale, especially in late summer when liquidity is at its lowest.\u201d\n\nInvestors are also cautiously anticipating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday, which may signal more rate hikes or a negative attitude towards digital assets.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies compete with fiat currencies, so a Fed Chairman may not possibly see Bitcoin as anything but a pesky competitor. Chairman Powell is likely to be negative about Bitcoin but it\u2019s nothing new: many regulators have made negative statements about cryptocurrencies,\u201d wrote Konanykhin in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nStory continues\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 1.62% to US$1.05 trillion while market volume decreased 12.34% to US$28.43 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nForkast 500 sees rare rise\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.41% to 2,279.88 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 6.90% in the past week.\n\nSolana\u2019s non-fungible token (NFT) sales rose 124.43% to US$2.29 million after the new Meegos collection reached over US$1.1 million in sales during the past 24 hours. The Forkast SOL NFT Composite fell 1.23% in the past 24 hours, suggesting that liquidity from established Solana-native collections is flowing into the Meegos collection.\n\ngmaz2xwjXEM7LnSswmJFAnqAXsccdBdRfJHpI25G3eRkY2irRfqW2FfS6UlNsciWKx C760jlxaMfav3hLoMdTscdt1OXMUlKLcqYcQ6nU7KIVMej3v8\n\n\u201cSolana is having a big day of sales, up over 122% and now in the #2 spot on CryptoSlam\u2019s blockchain rankings. A majority of these sales are behind a new PFP collection called Meegos, which was created by Blocksmith Labs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 11.89% to US$8.67 million, but that of the largest Ethereum-based collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, fell 11.33% to US$1.23 million. DeGods sales rose over 309% to US$883,229, making it the third largest NFT collection across all chains by 24-hour sales volume.\n\nAsian equities fall, U.S. stock futures gain ahead of Powell\u2019s speech\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities fell as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong on Friday, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all declining.\n\nBeijing proposed that local governments scrap a rule that disqualifies people with previous mortgages from being considered first-time homebuyers in major cities, in an attempt to halt the slump in the mainland\u2019s residential property market. Yet, the move failed to boost investor sentiment.\n\nInvestors worldwide were cautiously anticipating key speeches by Fed Chair Jerome Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium later today, for signs on future interest rate decisions.\n\nBoth the euro and the British pound hit a new two-month low ahead of today\u2019s speeches.\n\nMajor U.S. stock futures rose for a fourth consecutive day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures all posting gains.\n\nSee related article: Singapore\u2019s Stablecoin framework, Australia\u2019s crypto landscape & Binance shuts \u2018Connect\u2019\n\n(Updates with equities section)"

        "content": "Bitcoin dropped to around the US$26,000 level Friday morning in Asia, giving up much of the previous day\u2019s gains. Ahead of the U.S Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s Friday speech at Jackson Hole, investors are looking for signs of an end to the rate hike cycle, with repercussions for the crypto market. Ether moved lower to near the US$1,600 support level, while most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged losses. Solana led the losers after its own day of gains Thursday. The Forkast 500 NFT index gained slightly as the Solana blockchain\u2019s new partnership with e-commerce platform Shopify points to better times ahead for NFTs. U.S. stock futures traded mixed after Wall Street closed lower on Thursday, with all three major U.S. indexes logging losses of over 1%.\n\nBitcoin gives up gains as cautionary mood prevails\n\nBitcoin dropped 1.40% in the last 24 hours to US$26,081.21 as of 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong and traded 2.90% lower for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached a low of US$25,914.93 on early Friday, a 2.9% decline from its high daily high of US$26,688.48 on Thursday.\n\nAccording to Samer Hasn, market analyst at Australia-based global multi-asset broker XS.com, the current caution in the crypto market is due to increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has brought lawsuits against a number of digital asset firms, including Ripple Labs, Binance.US and Coinbase. Luxembourg-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp said Thursday it will stop Ether staking services for U.S. customers from Sep. 25 in light of recent regulatory developments.\n\nHasn said the \u201cnegative sentiment may continue to put pressure on the cryptocurrency market in the coming weeks or months until a regulatory and legislative environment that regulates the cryptocurrency market becomes clear.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to data from blockchain intelligence firm Santiment that shows Bitcoin whales moving large amounts of the token to their wallets as a further sign of a decline in market sentiment.\n\n\u201cThe relatively huge movements in cryptocurrency wallets, led by Bitcoin, may continue to weaken the confidence of participants and fuel a state of caution about what may happen in the future in the market and lead to collapses or wide fluctuations,\u201d Hasn added.\n\nGreta Yuan, head of research at Hong Kong-based digital asset exchange VDX, said that investors have to recognize that \u201cthe bear market is not over yet.\u201d With trading volume across the market still weak, Bitcoin\u2019s price could remain in the range of US$25,000-27,000 for some time, she added.\n\nAlongside Bitcoin\u2019s losses, Ether also dipped 1.40% to US$1,652.77 and was down 3.27% over the past seven days.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower over the past 24 hours. The exception was Binance\u2019s BNB token, which edged up 0.58% to US$217.48 but still logged a weekly loss of 1.87%.\n\nMastercard said it will end four crypto card programs in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Bahrain by September 22. The global payment giant was partnered with Binance on the four programs. No reason was provided for the cancellations, first reported by Reuters on Thursday.\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token led the losers, falling 3.09% to US$20.90 for a weekly loss of 4.98%.\n\nSOL reached a four-day high of US$21.99 on Thursday as it announced that Solana Pay \u2014 a free-to-use payment protocol built on the Solana blockchain \u2014 has partnered with Canada-based e-commerce platform Shopify to allow USDC stablecoin payments for online shopping without intermediary fees.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.23% to US$1.05 trillion. Trading volume fell 22.52% to US$27.41 billion.\n\nSigns of life for NFTs?\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.20% over the past 24 hours to 2,274.13 as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still down 7.36% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum and Cardano NFT indexes dropped, while the Solana and Polygon indexes moved up.\n\n\u201cGlobal sales are up to over US$15m in the past 24 hours and the Forkast 500 has been flashing green over this period. I wouldn\u2019t expect this to last though,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, via a note.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 24.48% in the past 24 hours to US$15.20 million. Volumes on the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon and Cardano blockchains all logged increases, while the Bitcoin network\u2019s volume dropped, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nSolana spearheaded the increase in NFT trading volumes, surging over 125% in the past 24 hours to US$2.24 million and second place in CryptoSlam\u2019s volumes ranking.\n\n\u201cA majority of these sales are behind a new profile-picture (PFP) collection called Meegos that was created by Blocksmith Labs. In just a few hours the collection has 10x the sales as the second ranked Solana collection, totaling over US$1 million in sales today,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana\u2019s recently-announced partnership with e-commerce platform Shopify has provided a much-needed boost to the NFT market.\n\n\u201cMost NFTs you have to pay for with crypto, and we need crypto adoption,\u201d Petscher said in a video posted to YouTube Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is just an inevitable step to bring people into Web3, like what we\u2019re seeing with Paypal and their introduction of a stablecoin, so mass adoption is happening,\u201d he added.\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) continued to top the 24-hour sales volume for NFT collections. It rose 6.64% in the past 24 hours to US$1.28 million. Solana-based Meegos and Mythos Chain-based DMarket placed second and third in the ranking.\n\nMeanwhile, art NFTs \u2014 especially generative art \u2014 remain a big seller, despite the bear market.\n\nMomentum, a generative art collection by Dutch artist Rik Oostenbroek, was released on Thursday as part of Velocity \u2014 an NFT series launched by crypto exchange Bybit and Formula One racing team Oracle Red Bull Racing. It sold out within the day.\n\nElsewhere, Eric Calderon, founder of generative art platform Art Blocks, released his \u201cheart + craft\u201d NFT collection on the Arbitrum blockchain on Friday. Each of the NFTs in the collection contain a generative art piece and a 3D printable model that can be used to generate physical replicas of the artwork.\n\nPowell speech to shed light on Fed policy\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell|Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading mixed as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong. Wall Street closed lower at the end of regular session trading Thursday. All three major U.S. indexes fell more than 1% as the Nvidia-led tech rally subsided.\n\nMain stock indexes across Asia also dipped on Friday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged losses\n\nAll eyes are now on the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday, which will be attended by central bank leaders from across the world. The speech will provide further insights into the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\nThe Fed raised its interest rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% in July, the highest level in 22 years. Powell said following July\u2019s meeting that the central bank will take a \u201cdata-dependent\u201d approach when deciding how to reduce the country\u2019s annual inflation below its long-term goal of 2%.\n\n\u201cFading expectations of recession have brought the focus back to inflation and a potential tight Fed,\u201d analysts at Bank of America said in note viewed by Reuters.\n\n\u201cRisk assets have started showing more signs of weakness than at any other point this year,\u201d they added. \u201cWe therefore think equities are more at risk of a macro-driven shock than the market is pricing in.\u201d\n\nAhead of Powell\u2019s speech, Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins told Yahoo! Finance on Thursday that the Fed might need to raise the interest rate further and keep it elevated for longer.\n\n\u201cI think it is going to take some time to really be sure we are seeing sustained realignment of demand and supply that is needed in order to bring inflation back on a path that will get back to 2%,\u201d said Collins.\n\nMeanwhile, Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker told CNBC on Thursday he thought the Fed should keep the interest rate as it is \u201cfor a while.\u201d The economy could see rate cuts in 2024 depending on the data, he added.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 19.5% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September, up from 13.5% on Thursday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "Robinhood accumulates $3B of Bitcoin in 3 months \u2014 What does this mean for markets? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In a swift and intriguing turn of events, a previously enigmatic Bitcoin (BTC) address managed to catapult itself to the esteemed position of the third-largest holder of BTC. As reported by Cointelegraph on Aug. 22, the address in question accumulated a staggering 118,000 BTC.\n\nWhile its identity has now been attributed to Robinhood, questions still linger, as the financial giant has neither confirmed nor denied that it owns the address. Some on-chain analysts posit that the stash actually belongs to MicroStrategy, the U.S. business intelligence and analytics software firm, which holds 152,800 BTC, as per their recent submission to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIs TradFi dethroning crypto-focused intermediaries?\n\nShould Robinhood\u2019s ownership of the 118,000 BTC be validated, the consequences could reverberate across the cryptocurrency landscape. Traditionally, the largest Bitcoin addresses have predominantly been linked to crypto-native exchanges. However, Robinhood\u2019s role as a conventional broker focused on equities and options sets an intriguing precedent.\n\nA glance at Robinhood\u2019s latest 10-Q filing reveals that they held $4.24 billion in Bitcoin. Given Bitcoin\u2019s price neared $30,500 on June 30, this equates to approximately 139,016 BTC \u2014 a fact that aligns seamlessly with the on-chain analysts\u2019 contentions regarding Robinhood\u2019s substantial crypto holdings.\n\nIf Robinhood is the owner of the \u201cmystery\u201d Bitcoin address, this makes one point pretty clear. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t rely on big institutions to succeed. Analysts used to argue that for Bitcoin to really take off, more big investment firms or companies like Tesla and Block needed to get on board. But those hopes fizzled out as recent reports from Apple and Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) revealed they hadn\u2019t taken the Bitcoin plunge after all.\n\nRegarding Robinhood, reports say that by June 2023, they had around 23.2 million active users. If just 10% owned some Bitcoin, they would need an average of about $1,828 each to reach the reported $4.24 billion in Bitcoin holdings. This shows that regular people, like those on Robinhood, can play a significant role in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nThe downside of Bitcoin being held by Robinhood\n\nWhile some investors want Bitcoin mass adoption by any means possible, getting there is not without risk. Robinhood\u2019s user base is known for its penchant for speculative trading, notably in meme stocks like AMC, GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond. These traders also boast substantial holdings in Dogecoin (DOGE) \u2014 amounting to a staggering $2.63 billion.\n\nTheir propensity for short-term investments raises questions about their approach to Bitcoin. If these investors purchased BTC in anticipation of U.S. spot-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, the prospect of a prolonged price decline or delayed approval might trigger mass sell-offs.\n\nFurthermore, a more remote yet conceivable risk emerges from the possibility of U.S. government intervention. Although the probability of a scenario akin to the 1933 Executive Order 6102, which mandated private gold holdings be exchanged for paper currency, seems slim, potential actions by U.S. authorities could potentially jeopardize these holdings.\n\nEven in the unlikely scenario where the U.S. justice system or the Internal Revenue Service opts to lock down those assets while investigating users for tax or similar issues, the substantial stash of Bitcoin held by Robinhood only amplifies the potential risks. Robinhood\u2019s expansive pool of assets heightens the risk of such actions affecting a larger portion of the market.\n\nRelated: ARK, Glassnode propose Bitcoin economic analytics framework using new metric\n\nParadoxically, this vast accumulation of cryptocurrency holdings by Robinhood clients could potentially serve as ammunition for ETF applicants. While offering a comparable service, Robinhood\u2019s potential lack of investor protections could incentivize the establishment of more secure and regulated ETFs.\n\nThe newfound prominence of Robinhood in the cryptocurrency sphere underscores the ever-evolving nature of the market. Whether or not spot Bitcoin ETFs materialize, investors will find alternative avenues to enhance their exposure to cryptocurrency, be it through MicroStrategy shares, Robinhood or other innovative means. This adaptability aptly demonstrates that in the realm of finance, innovation and progress are inevitable, much like nature\u2019s unyielding drive to find a way.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Is the cryptocurrency market back? That\u2019s one of the most common questions we hear on the web, as Coinbase was recently approved to offer cryptocurrency futures trading to retail investors in the United States by the National Futures Association (NFA). This is a big win for crypto enthusiasts, as Coinbase previously only offered the derivatives to institutional investors. Some say this has opened the floodgates to potential buyers and sellers of BTC and ETH futures, increasing the currency's adoption in the financial market. How does this regulatory approval affect the market as a whole?\n\nAccording to industry expert Denis Sklyarov, co-founder and CEO of WiFi Map, \u201cThe approval granted to Coinbase for listing regulated and leveraged crypto futures in the US is a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency industry. It demonstrates digital assets' growing acceptance and integration into traditional financial markets\u201d.\n\nIf you are uncomfortable buying the currency derivatives themselves, you may check out companies that mine them as a potential proxy for the currencies\u2019 possible performance. Here are three buy-rated Bitcoin mining companies we think you should watch.\n\nCleanSpark Inc. (\n\nCLSK\n\n)\n\nCleanSpark, Inc. is an industrial-scale Bitcoin mining and infrastructure company. Its subsidiaries, CleanBlok, Inc. and ATL Data Centers LLC, operate the company\u2019s Bitcoin mining operations. CLSK also owns and maintains actual property holdings through its other subsidiaries, CSRE Property Management Company, CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, LLC, and CSRE Properties, LLC; it maintains real property holdings for ATL Data Centers LLC and CleanBlok Inc. The company also owns Mawson Infrastructure Group Inc., which provides a Bitcoin mining facility with an output of nearly 560 petahashes per second (PH/s)in Sandersville, Georgia.\n\nCleanSpark recently announced that its acquisitions of new facilities will be going live to further assist in mining operations. These acquisitions are predicted to provide substantial output efficiency in its operations.\n\nAnalyst Rating\n\nAnalysts have high expectations for CLSK, as everyone covering the company issued it a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d recommendation. The mean target price for CLSK is $11.25, with a high target of $14.00, an upside potential of almost 3x.\n\nCipher Mining (\n\nCIFR\n\n)\n\nCipher Mining Inc. is a technology company that operates and develops bitcoin mining data centers on an industrial scale. Cipher Mining\u2019s operations include four Bitcoin mining data centers in Texas. Its Odessa, Texas facility has a production capacity of approximately 4.2 exahash per second (EH/s).

The mean target for RIOT is $18.61, and the high target price is $24.00, with an upside potential of 132%.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile some may argue that the cryptocurrency market is still in its early stages, we can\u2019t deny that some investors are bullish on their technological outlook. The increasing adoption and application of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technologies are slowly building a foundation for continued progress. These and their inclusion in the financial markets have added another win for pro-crypto investors.\n\nMore Stock Market News from Barchart\n\nApple Stock: Buy the 10% Dip Because the Future Looks Bright Stocks Tumble on a Sell-Off in Mega-Cap Tech Stocks 3 Energy Stocks to Add to Your Dividend Portfolio 5 Proven Ways to Cut Travel Costs in RetirementOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Must Reads On Bitcoin, Options & SPY Returns - ETF Trends",
        "content": "By Cinthia Murphy\n\nResearch is often a collective effort. This week, we wanted to highlight some interesting work we\u2019ve come across from our friends in the industry \u2013 our midsummer reading list, if you will.\n\nThe Latest on Spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs may be upon us\u2026sometime \u2018soonish.\u2019\n\nWe have certainly spilled an enormous amount of ink on this issue, especially since BlackRock\u2019s muscle entered the fight mid-June with an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. We are now approaching 10 providers in this race, which is now 8 years in the making, and the SEC remains reluctant to bite.\n\nWe also have the existing Bitcoin-futures and Bitcoin-related funds that are already navigating the space. They include:\n\nContent continues below advertisement\n\nIf you are an advisor, you probably need to stay relatively informed so that you can field client questions.\n\nTo that end, Ric Edelman, veteran investor, advisor, and author who\u2019s also founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, just published a white paper that may be an interesting resource to you. Titled \u201cWhat You Need to Know About Spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201c the paper explores the history, the current state and the potential future impact of accessing Bitcoin through ETFs.\n\nConsider this: \u201cOnly 12% of financial advisors currently recommend Bitcoin to clients, but more than three-fourths of advisors (77%) say they will recommend a spot Bitcoin ETF when they become available,\u201d Edelman says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that two-thirds of the nation\u2019s investors rely on financial advisors for investment recommendations,\u201d he adds, suggesting that a go-ahead from the advisory space could unleash a massive wave of demand. If true, this could be huge because Bitcoin has inelastic, finite supply. It\u2019s that kind of thinking that has many of us in the industry seating on the edge of our seats waiting to see what happens next in this approval race.\n\nFor now, Edelman shares his views on what\u2019s at stake, and offers 5 key risks to consider when investing in a spot Bitcoin ETF, whenever they are available. It\u2019s a handy guide that addresses market risk, regulatory risk, operational risk, liquidity risk and tracking risk.\n\nA Little About 0DTE Options\n\nOptions seem to be everywhere these days in ETF land. Roughly 20% of ETF launches so far in 2023 have been options-based ETFs.\n\nBroadly speaking, options can serve many roles in a strategy, but in ETF wrappers they are often being implemented to achieve one of two outcomes: income generation or downside protection. (Think, for example, ETF lineups such as YieldMax and Innovator, among many others.)\n\nThe single largest actively managed ETF today is an options-based ETF seeking income, JEPI. The fund is nearing $30 billion in assets and its massive asset-gathering success has now several copycats from other providers currently sitting in registration. Options-based ETF investing, as a segment, has serious momentum behind it both in terms of product development and investor demand.\n\nAs an advisor, it is important to understand how options work and how they work within ETF portfolios \u2013 their benefits and their risks. (We\u2019ve written about the innerworkings of JEPI recently for that reason.) To quote Joshua Wilson, head of advisory group United Ethos, there\u2019s a lot to consider when looking at options-linked ETFs. At a high level, consider for instance:\n\nThe timing of entry and exit from a buffer-type fund, which has a big impact on the upside capture and downside protection levels achieved outside of reset day. \u201cIt\u2019s something people often look over.\u201d\n\nThe cost of transacting in the options market, which can vary over time. Price to volatility, time cost \u2013 all these variables matter. \u201cWith options, there are several variables that stocks don\u2019t have to consider. That\u2019s best understood by remembering that options are nothing more than publicly traded insurance contracts. When fear goes up, costs go up.\u201d\n\nThe risk of poor trading execution for ETFs, which run the risk of seeing rollover of options gamed by the market on expiration. \u201cIt\u2019s like an index. Around reconstitution, some stocks benefit and some are hurt by it. If you get ahead of those days and know what big institutions are going to do, you can trade that to your advantage. There can be a gaming of these large positions at rollover period, especially as these ETFs grow very large.\u201d\n\nMore granularly, one of the quickly growing areas of the options market is 0DTEs (zero days to expiration options). Cboe Global Markets just released a white paper titled \u201cThe Rise of SPX & 0DTE Options\u201d that could be an interesting resource for options research.\n\nSenior Derivatives Analyst Jonathan Zaionz, author of the paper, points out that options volume growth, annually, has more than doubled since 2019 from its earlier stride of 11% annual growth since 2000. That\u2019s largely thanks to the surge in usage in index (SPX) and 0DTE options.\n\nHe notes that trading in SPX options neared 3 million contracts a day, on average, in the first half of the year, and more than 40% of that volume was in 0DTEs. \u201cWhile only accounting for approximately 6% of total options volume traded daily, SPX options represent approximately 33% of total dollars in premium traded, and over 50% of notional exposure traded.\u201d\n\nAccording to Zaionz: \u201cInitially, options volume growth was the largest in options on single name equities as investors took a liking to stocks such as Tesla, GameStop, and AMC. Since late 2021, several types of investors have shifted their preference away from single stock options to broad based index options such as SPX. Growth in SPX options is more than double that of the rest of the options market since 2020, with a substantial portion of that growth coming from 0DTE trading.\u201d\n\nThe white paper is full of interesting data that explores use cases, popular strategies, costs, market impact, benefits, and risks of investing in these options. It\u2019s on our must-read list this summer.\n\nShout Out to Data Nerds\n\nAs a final note, our friend Nick Maggiulli, COO at Ritholtz Wealth Management and author of personal finance blog Of Dollars And Data, released this week his latest data tool: a S&P 500 Historical Return Calculator. You can play with it here: https://ofdollarsanddata.com/sp500-calculator/\n\nThis tool allows you to research both nominal and inflation-adjusted returns (with and without dividend reinvestment) for the S&P 500 dating back to 1871.\n\nMaggiulli offers best practices, how-tos and things to consider when playing around with the calculator. It\u2019s a cool little piece of tech that can come in handy when you are looking for that market perspective.\n\nHappy reading!\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the ETF Strategist Channel.\n\nDisclosure\n\nAll investments involve risk, including possible loss of principal.\n\nThe material provided here is for informational purposes only and should not be considered an individualized recommendation or personalized investment advice.

The new offering arrives as stablecoins, a roughly $124 billion subset of digital assets, are increasingly in demand in emerging regions with frail financial systems such as Latin America and Turkey. People also use these cryptocurrencies to send remittances and store value, according to a report by crypto research firm Chainalysis. \"Currently, Colombia is one of the main recipients of remittances in Latin America, with nearly USD 10 billion flowing into the country,\" Agust\u00edn Liserra, CEO of Num Finance, said in a statement. \"Num Finance aims to provide a new possibility for people to send and receive nCOP as remittances and receive a yield on it.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin fell 1.45% from Aug. 18 to Aug. 25 to US$26,095 as of 8:00 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading below US$30,000 since Aug. 9. Ether, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, fell 1.84% over the week to US$1,654.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bitcoin dropped to US$25,628, its lowest point in two months.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has been weighed down by numerous factors, including large holders selling during a low-liquidity period, according to Alex Konanykhin, the chief executive officer and founder of Unicoin, an equity-backed crypto that pays dividends.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is inherently volatile. Its price can be driven down by negative news or by a large sale, especially in late summer when liquidity is at its lowest.\u201d\n\nCoinbase Global, the company behind the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., announced Monday that it acquired an equity stake in Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. While the size of the equity stake is unknown, Coinbase noted that it will share the revenue from interest on USDC reserves with Circle, based on the amount of stablecoins held on the two platforms.\n\nThe Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which is a multifactorial measure of crypto market sentiment, sank to 37 on Wednesday, its lowest point since March 12 when the index plunged to 32 just two days after the third-largest bank failure in the U.S., the collapse of crypto-friendly Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will be speaking at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium later today, along with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. Investors will be following the speech for signs on future interest rate decisions.\n\n\u201cParsing the July Fed minutes, it is clear that policymakers are grappling with the decision to implement further rate hikes as they acknowledge the threat of resurgent inflation,\u201d cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex said in its research report. \u201cAll eyes are now on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s upcoming Jackson Hole speech on the economic outlook.\u201d\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.05 trillion on Friday at 8:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 10.25% from US$1.17 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$508 billion, Bitcoin represented 48.4% of the market while Ether, valued at US$198 billion, accounted for 18.9%.\n\nNotable Movers: BONE & SUI\n\nBone, the governance and reward token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, was this week\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 100, rising 15.71% to US$1.44. Pseudonymous Shiba Inu developer, Shytoshi Kusama, shared a \u201cShibarium scaling\u201d update on Wednesday. Shibarium, an Ethereum layer-2 chain for Shiba Inu, is currently preparing for a reopening after botching its launch earlier this month.\n\nSui blockchain\u2019s native coin (SUI) was this week\u2019s second biggest gainer in the top 100, rising 14.22% to US$0.5472.\n\nNext Week: Will Bitcoin fall to US$25,000?\n\nBitcoin could retrace to the US$25,000 support level next week, but that could set the stage for the next price rally, according to Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App.\n\n\u201cAt this point, US$25,000 serves as the next support level, and after that US$20,000. If Bitcoin drops below US$20,000, it could revisit this cycle\u2019s low of US$15,700, especially if the stock market drops to its October 2020 lows. If the stock market stays firm, Bitcoin will likely stay around the current levels,\u201d wrote Kiely, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nUnicoin\u2019s Konanykhin said he expects Bitcoin and Ether to close the month of August near their current levels of US$26,000 and US$1,650.\n\nNext week, investors will be looking ahead to the release of the U.S. jobs report on Friday, which includes economic indicators such as nonfarm payrolls typically used by economists to gauge the Fed\u2019s next monetary policy decision.\n\nIn the crypto space, U.S.-based crypto exchange Bitstamp will halt trading for SOL, SAND, NEAR, MATIC, MANA, CHZ and AXS, starting next Thursday, to evaluate \u201crecent market developments.\u201d The exchange said that customers in the U.S. will still be able to hold and withdraw these assets.\n\nSee related article: Hackers hit Curve, China announces blockchain link & is FTX back?"

During this period, Bitcoin has historically consolidated,\u201d he explained.\n\nUploading various comparative charts, Filbfilb predicted that miners should begin to bid price higher into the Bitcoin halving \u2014 with this occurring around 1,276 days after each prior halving.\n\n\u201cMiners are incentivized to ensure that prices are well above marginal cost prior to the halving.

        "content": "Crypto asset management company Hashdex has joined the competition for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. The firm has submitted an application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a Bitcoin futures ETF that will hold spot Bitcoin.\n\nETFs are investment funds that trade on a stock market, with their value derived from an underlying basket of assets such as stocks, bonds, commodities and other financial instruments. Similarly, Bitcoin ETFs track BTC\u2019s value and trade on traditional stock exchanges rather than crypto exchanges.\n\nHashdex\u2019s approach differs from recent filings as it won\u2019t depend on the Coinbase surveillance sharing agreement, opting to acquire spot Bitcoin from physical exchanges within the CME market. According to a 19b-4 filing by NYSE Arca with the U.S. SEC, Hashdex intends to include spot Bitcoin in its Bitcoin futures ETF and modify the name, changing its ticker to Hashdex Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBreaking: NYSE files a modification to another ETF, to be now called the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF\n\n\n\nTheir application is unique in that it will not use Coinbase, they will use prices and acquire spot BTC via CME.\n\n\n\nIt will hold a mixture of spot & futures positions\n\nHard to reject imo pic.twitter.com/K1ABKKZX5o \u2014 Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) August 25, 2023\n\nSome experts have responded to Hashdex\u2019s unique Bitcoin ETF filing. James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg, observed that the strategy involves exclusively conducting exchange for related positions transactions. This entails swapping futures contracts for an equivalent spot exposure instead of direct cash purchases from exchanges.\n\nSeyffart anticipates a higher likelihood of SEC approval, considering the pressure on Gary Gensler stemming from the Grayscale lawsuit, Ethereum futures submission, and BlackRock\u2019s incorporation of the Coinbase surveillance sharing agreement.\n\nRelated: Former Binance\u200b.US CEO joins Hashdex board\n\nOther specialists, including Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, investor Alistair Milne and finance attorney Scott Johnsson, have responded to Hashdex\u2019s distinctive Bitcoin ETF submission.

        "content": "Asian cryptocurrency exchange HashKey is set to start offering Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) crypto trading services to retail customers in Hong Kong starting on Aug. 28, according to a local media report. Investors will only be allowed to invest up to 30% of their net worth into cryptocurrencies when using the platform.\n\nHashKey became the first crypto exchange in Hong Kong to get regulatory clearance to offer crypto trading services to retail traders after upgrading two major licenses issued by the country\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). The first license, known as Type 1, made way for HashKey to start a virtual asset trading platform under Hong Kong\u2019s securities laws. The second license, called Type 7, allows the crypto exchange to provide automated trading services to both institutional and retail users.\n\nApart from HashKey, another crypto platform called OSL also received a regulatory nod from the SFC to offer BTC and ETH retail trading services. The new license regime has made way for Hong Kong to establish itself as one of the few countries that allow crypto retail trading services under the pureview of law.\n\nHong Kong started the year 2023 with a focus on building a crypto friendly environment in the country. Hong Kong\u2019 Financial Secretary Paul Chan noted at the start of the year that the local government and regulators are looking forward to building a crypto and fintech ecosystem in 2023.\n\nRelated: Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia collaborate on tokens and payments\n\nBy March, more than 80 crypto firms had expressed interest in opening their offices in Hong Kong, including several crypto heavy weights. In April, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) called on banks to provide services to cryptocurrency firms. By May of the same year, the HKMA had announced a licensing regime for the crypto platforms with a deadline of June 1. By August, a couple of crypto platforms had been approved to offer crypto trading services to retail and institutional clients.\n\nThe role of the regulatory framework that helps to protect investors is quite evident in the case of Hong Kong, where retail traders will have access to only BTC and ETH, which the exchange believes is enough for the retail traders\u2019 need.\n\nHashKey didn\u2019t respond to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comments before publication time.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Hall of Flame: Wolf Of All Streets worries about a world where Bitcoin hits $1M"

        "content": "On the latest episode of Macro Markets, Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman explains why United States consumption remains strong while auto-loan and credit card balance delinquency is accelerating. According to Pechman, consumers built a cushion of extra cash savings as the U.S. government injected money to avoid a recession and temporarily forgave student loan repayments.\n\nBut, according to investment bank JPMorgan, \u201cconsumers have spent down the entirety of their excess savings from the pandemic, which at one point totaled more than $2 trillion,\u201d as reported by Business Insider. Pechman believes that if JPMorgan\u2019s predictions are correct, the stock market should have been trading much lower. Still, Pechman doesn\u2019t think that betting against the S&P 500 is sound advice, given that inflation is right around the corner and the government will be forced to inject liquidity to avoid a recession.\n\nFor the show\u2019s next topic, Pechman dissects the Chinese central bank\u2019s intervention after the yuan hit a 16-year low against the U.S. dollar. For Pechman, the biggest risk is the market doubting the country\u2019s ability to sustain a stronger yuan, meaning betting that the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s reserves won\u2019t be enough to sustain the desired level.\n\nIn essence, what the Chinese central bank is doing has limits and ultimately is a risky bet, argues Pechman. For now, according to the analyst, there seems to be no imminent risk coming from the yuan, but it is worth keeping an eye on.\n\nFor further insights into these matters, tune in to the latest episode of Macro Markets, exclusively available on the newly launched Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel."

Discover SCENE\n\nAmid a protracted bear market, a new conceptual framework for understanding the Bitcoin economy was launched Thursday.\n\nDavid Puell, research associate for ARK Invest, and James Check, lead analyst for Glassnode, co-authored a whitepaper dubbed \u201cCointime Economics: A New Framework For Bitcoin On-chain Analysis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt provides a toolkit to properly understand the economic realities of Bitcoin,\u201d Check told Decrypt, detailing that it \u201cadds a new lens to assess the market.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe whitepaper provides insight into the differences between the current unspent transaction (UTXO) a new \"cointime \" model for understanding what the authors call the \u201creal economic weight of a Bitcoin.\"\n\n\n\nCointime economics approaches Bitcoin from a time-based perspective, proposing that the importance of Bitcoin is based on the last time a coin moved. The model introduces a new concept called a \"coinblock,\" which essentially multiplies the number of Bitcoin and the number of blocks produced while the Bitcoin remains unmoved.\n\nFor example, 10 coins held during the time necessary to produce 10 blocks represents 100 coinblocks.\n\n\u201cHeavy coinblock destruction suggests that long-term holders are selling,\" the report explains. Bitcoin\u2019s \u201csmart money,\u201d in other words, and they \u201ctypically hold larger bitcoin balances and trade from lower cost bases, generating higher profits.\"\n\nAccording to the document, two new metrics can also be used to analyze Bitcoin\u2019s economic state.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Liveliness\" refers to how active or alive the network is, or how often coins have been \u201cdestroyed\u201d or moved. \"Vaultedness\" measures coins that are stored, alluding to how \u201cinactive\u201d the protocol is.\n\n\u201cWe believe the Cointime framework provides a highly consistent, mathematical framework measuring the economic importance of each bitcoin through time,\u201d the report read.\n\nFor Check, unlike the traditional UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) analysis\u2014which he says is \u201cvery granular and requires bespoke data engineering\u201d\u2014Cointime offers a \u201cmacro view.\u201d\n\nHe explained to Decrypt that \u201cit is simple to calculate and easy to replicate without proprietary data science.\u201d\n\nJames Check, co-author and Glassnode\u2019s lead analyst, told Decrypt that under this framing, \u201cthe bear market is much worse than expected.\u201d\n\nIn the Cointime\u2019s model, \u201csince lost coins were largely in the early years, they hold tremendous unrealized profits (over $35 billion),\u201d said Check. \u201cHowever, when we use 'cost basis' models like realized price, the losses held by active investors are masked by the profits held by lost coins.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder this framework, the true cost basis of the market is actually at around $32,000, which we are still underneath,\u201d Check added.\n\nPuell and Check highlight several value propositions of cointime economics, including reassessing Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate and the network\u2019s valuation. Check suggested that cointime economics has two possible areas of use.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOn-chain analysts who are deep in the field and will use it to inspire new ideas,\u201d he said, and \u201cinstitutional investors looking for simpler models with higher signal.\u201d\n\nThe co-authors concluded that \u201cat the core, we have a simple mathematics toolkit to achieve vastly superior economic and valuation models which account for both the supply and demand side of the market.\u201d"

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price has failed to recover from the more than 11% crash, resulting in the cryptocurrency trading at $25,899.\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty is at its all-time high, which is a good sign for the network but not for the miners.\n\nTo adjust the losses borne from BTC crashing, miners are shedding from their reserve, selling $72 million worth of BTC in a day.\n\nBitcoin price crash brought losses to everyone - investors and traders and did not even spare miners. The people who have been validating the blocks on the network bore the brunt of the market as they faced unprecedented losses, forcing them to move to sell for a long time.\n\nBitcoin price crash causes distress to miners\n\nBitcoin price had been hovering around $30,000 before it crashed this month, and at the time of writing, the cryptocurrency could be seen under the $26,000 mark. The biggest cryptocurrency in the world has already failed all its attempts to chart a recovery and is presently declining further below the lows of the August crash.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart\n\nFollowing the crash, the Bitcoin mining difficulty hit an all-time high, which, while a good thing for the network, is actually concerning for the miners. An increase in mining difficulty is usually a sign of growing competition as more miners join the network in a bid to make profits. This bolsters the security of the network, keeping it safe from a 51% attack (an attack where one miner(s) controls 51% of the blockchain validation, killing decentralization).\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty\n\nThis increase in competition, combined with an increase in block validation difficulty as well as the low price of BTC, thanks to the recent crash, dropped a bomb of losses on the miners. Consequently, these miners had to sell the BTC they held in their reserves. The miner reserve currently holds about 1.843 million BTC, which 24 hours ago was around 1.846 million BTC.\n\nIn the span of a day, Bitcoin miners sold about 2,803 BTC worth approximately $72.8 million, the highest to cover the losses they have been experiencing. Since operation costs (costs amounting to constantly running mining rigs) are consistently increasing, the miners are forced to sell their holdings in order to pay their bills.\n\nBitcoin miner outflows\n\nThese losses are expected to be minimized going forward, provided Bitcoin price bounces back to reclaim $26,430 as a support floor. However, if the bearishness does not subside, BTC could slide to June lows of $25,126."

        "title": "Hacking Incidents Shake the Crypto World: How Bitcoin Stands Strong - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency landscape has captured the imagination of individuals and institutions all around the world, with its promise of decentralized finance and safe transactions. However, recent hacking instances have raised concerns about the security of digital assets.\n\nIn the face of these problems, Bitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, holds firm, demonstrating resilience and providing vital lessons on security, innovation, and the future of digital money. We look at the impact of hacking attacks on the crypto world, investigate how Bitcoin remains strong, and reveal the metrics that demonstrate its resilience in a fast expanding digital era.\n\nThe Cryptocurrency Security Paradox\n\nSecurity Concerns in the Crypto Landscape\n\nThe attractiveness of cryptocurrencies arises from their potential to reshape financial systems by removing geographical restrictions and intermediaries. However, because these assets are digital, they are subject to cyberattacks. Recent high-profile hacking instances have sounded the alarm, emphasizing the critical necessity for effective security measures inside the crypto ecosystem.\n\nCrypto Hacks and Losses: Second Quarter 2023 Insights\n\nThe digital realm of cryptocurrencies faced another quarter of turmoil, as revealed by CertiK's quarterly report on blockchain security. More than $300 million in digital assets fell victim to crypto hacks and exploits in the second quarter of 2023, based on on-chain data compiled by the blockchain security company.\n\nThe report highlighted 212 security incidents during the quarter, resulting in a staggering $313,566,528 drained from Web3 protocols by malicious actors. Despite this concerning trend, there was a noticeable 58% decline in losses compared to the same period in 2022 when $745 million was lost to hacks and exploits.\n\nHowever, the quarter also witnessed some shifting dynamics. Exit scams saw a striking surge, contributing to almost $70 million in losses, almost doubling the losses incurred from similar scams in the previous quarter, which amounted to around $31 million.\n\nInterestingly, flash loans and oracle manipulation exploits experienced a sharp drop in the second quarter, contrasting their significant presence in the first quarter of 2023. The first quarter recorded 52 oracle manipulation attacks, resulting in approximately $222 million in losses. Notably, the Euler Finance hack constituted a substantial 85% of these losses. In the second quarter, the figures declined drastically, with 54 flash loan and oracle manipulation attacks leading to approximately $23 million in losses, marking an 89% reduction from the previous quarter.\n\nBitcoin's Persistence\n\nDespite these obstacles, Bitcoin remains a testimony to the potential resiliency of digital currencies. How has Bitcoin survived the assault of hacking attacks and market volatility? Let us look at some of the aspects that contribute to Bitcoin's strength:\n\nThe Immutability of the Blockchain: Bitcoin is built on the blockchain, a decentralized and immutable database that records transactions. Once a transaction has been added to the blockchain, it is nearly hard to change or reverse it. This immutability gives an additional degree of security, lowering the possibility of fraudulent activity. Decentralization: Because Bitcoin is decentralized, no single entity has complete control over the network. When compared to centralized databases that are vulnerable to single points of failure, this distributed structure makes it more difficult for hackers to infiltrate the entire system. Work Proof Consensus: Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism forces miners to solve challenging mathematical problems in order to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. Because this procedure necessitates a large amount of processing power and energy, bad actors will find it difficult to influence the network. Strong Cryptography: To secure transactions and wallets, Bitcoin employs complex cryptographic techniques. Private keys and digital signatures guarantee secure authentication, making illegal access extremely difficult. Community Vigilance: When it comes to security issues, the Bitcoin community is extremely watchful. Constant monitoring, peer-reviewed code, and collaborative efforts to address vulnerabilities all contribute to the network's ongoing security. Mt. Gox and Beyond: Lessons from the Past: Bitcoin's resilience is based on lessons learnt from previous incidents. Mt. Gox, one of the first and largest Bitcoin exchanges, went bankrupt, emphasizing the significance of secure custody solutions and regulatory compliance. Since then, the sector has matured, with exchanges and custodians adding strict security procedures.\n\nThe Big Picture: The Evolution of the Crypto Ecosystem\n\nWhile Bitcoin's robustness is admirable, the hacking episodes reveal bigger issues and potential in the crypto ecosystem:\n\nSecurity Innovations: Hacking incidences inspire the creation of novel security solutions. The industry is investing in solutions that improve user protection, including as multi-signature wallets, hardware wallets, and secure custody services. Regulatory Implications: The developing regulatory landscape seeks to achieve a balance between encouraging innovation and protecting consumers. Regulation can play a critical role in protecting investors and discouraging bad behaviour. Education and Awareness: It is critical to educate users. Individuals must comprehend the significance of secure behaviors such as choosing strong passwords, activating two-factor authentication, and being wary of phishing attempts. Technological Evolution: The crypto ecosystem is constantly evolving. To address known vulnerabilities, new consensus mechanisms, privacy upgrades, and scalability solutions are being developed. Collaboration for a Safer Future: Hacking incidents highlight the importance of collaboration among developers, exchanges, regulators, and users. Collective vigilance is required for the development of a secure and sustainable crypto environment.\n\nConclusion: How to Navigate the Crypto Landscape\n\nRecent hacking incidents in the crypto industry serve as a sharp reminder of the difficulties inherent in the digital financial arena. Despite the chaos, Bitcoin's tenacity shines as a beacon of optimism and opportunity. Its core principles of decentralization, immutability of the blockchain, and cryptographic security provide vital insights for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nThe lessons learned from these occurrences will impact the future of digital money as the crypto ecosystem evolves. While obstacles continue, they also spur innovation, collaboration, and a renewed dedication to secure procedures. The crypto community can pave the road for a safer, more resilient, and revolutionary financial future by embracing lessons learnt and aiming for continual progress."

        "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin\u2019s halving events have historically been pivotal moments, capturing the attention of both longtime Bitcoin maxis and crypto onlookers in general. These halvings, tied intrinsically to the underlying mechanics of Bitcoin, play a significant role in determining its future mining rewards rate and scarcity. However, as the crypto universe expands, newer tokens and innovative platforms are emerging, challenging the status quo and offering fresh tokenomics. One such new contender is ApeMax. While Bitcoin\u2019s anticipated halving in 2024 looms on the horizon, it\u2019s essential to also turn our gaze towards fresh faces like ApeMax that are making waves in the crypto sea. Let\u2019s dive deep into the intricacies of Bitcoin halving and explore the exciting realm of ApeMax.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Halving?\n\nBitcoin halving is a blockchain event that occurs roughly every four years, where the rewards miners receive for confirming and adding new transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain are halved. This mechanism was introduced by Bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, as a means of ensuring that the cryptocurrency remained deflationary. By the year 2140, all 21 million Bitcoin will have been mined. Given that nearly 89% of all Bitcoin has already been mined, these halving events are seen by some as crucial in prolonging the mining lifespan of Bitcoin and controlling its supply.\n\nWhat is ApeMax?\n\nAmidst this backdrop of the Bitcoin ecosystem, a new entrant has emerged in the crypto world \u2013 ApeMax. While Bitcoin halvings have dominated conversations in recent years, new tokens like ApeMax are gaining attention for their innovative approach. ApeMax, the latest sensation in the meme coin universe, stands out with its mascot, Max the Ape. Beyond its playful facade, ApeMax holders can enjoy features whereby they can earn rewards in a fun way.\n\nThe ApeMax presale is an event that crypto enthusiasts should keenly observe. During this phase, eligible early bird buyers get the opportunity to purchase ApeMax tokens at presale prices, with the chance to access the Early Birds Loot Boxes for discounts. But ApeMax\u2019s allure doesn\u2019t stop there. Its \u2018Boost to Earn\u2019 staking approach allows coin holders to boost entities they are passionate about while earning ApeMax tokens. Moreover, ApeMax emphasizes security, using audited smart contracts and offering immediate self-custody of purchased coins. This means holders can stake their tokens without delay, even during the presale phase.\n\nAs the crypto world anticipates the next Bitcoin halving, projects like ApeMax are alternative crypto opportunities with new types of innovation. While Bitcoin remains a significant player, the diverse world of cryptocurrencies offers various new opportunities, with ApeMax being one to watch.\n\nWhen is the Next Bitcoin Halving Event?\n\nThe last Bitcoin halving occurred in 2020, reducing the miner reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. The next halving event is expected around April 2024, further cutting down the reward to 3.125 BTC. This reduction in rewards, in tandem with rising operational costs, will require miners to reassess their strategies and become more efficient.\n\nHow will Bitcoin Halving Affect BTC Price?\n\nHistorically, some past Bitcoin halvings have triggered or coincided with a bull run in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. This is primarily attributed to the decreased supply and increased demand. But it\u2019s also worth noting that while Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate decreases with each halving, its actual impact on price can be influenced by a myriad of other factors including technological advancements, adoption rates, and global economic factors. While past performance can be studied, the future of Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies remains unpredictable.\n\nDelving into the world of cryptocurrencies necessitates meticulous research. The realm of crypto is characterized by its unpredictability and significant price fluctuations. It\u2019s imperative to remain informed, consult with impartial financial experts, and brace yourself for and understand the inherent risks present in all cryptocurrencies. For prospective ApeMax buyers, please be aware that it\u2019s not accessible for purchase in certain regions. Ineligible countries include the USA, Canada, and other specific zones. Always check the ApeMax website to confirm eligibility based on your region before proceeding with any purchase.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Bitcoin, as well as other crypto, has had a wild run in the past year. In the face of this, however, the African Bitcoin community has remained unfazed.\n\nAnita Posch is a digital nomad who has spent the past two years travelling Africa as a Bitcoin educator and teaches Bitcoin at grassroots levels. For Posch, who started a learning platform titled Crack The Orange, Bitcoin has one goal; facilitating a more just financial system. She believes in the potential of Bitcoin as an equaliser, giving people across the world access to the same monetary system and is committing a lot of time and effort to that gospel.\n\nOn Thursday, August 18, 2023, Bitcoin hit a new low as it fell over 8% to rest at $26,172, its biggest one-day drop since FTX collapsed in November 2022. Hundreds of thousands of traders liquidated about $500 million worth of the digital currency in 24 hours amid rumours that Space X had sold off all the Bitcoin they were holding.\n\nThe past year has been a wild ride for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The collapse of FTX triggered a lot of speculation around the legitimacy and fate of crypto, with investors liquidating their remaining assets and startups folding in the face of loss and limited capital. All of these sent the prices of digital assets plummeting, as the price of Bitcoin fell 22% percent in a day. The asset has since regained its losses since then.\n\nIn 2022, I spoke to a number of Bitcoin maximalists working on Bitcoin-related projects across the continent. There were a lot of elaborate plans on what Bitcoin could do for Africa, including plans for a Bitcoin village in Lagos, and Machankura, a custodial wallet that allows people to send and receive Bitcoin via USSD codes. One year and multiple scandals later, Bitcoiners still believe that real Bitcoin has largely been unaffected.\n\nAccording to Posch, who is currently in Zambia, people who really understand Bitcoin aren\u2019t bothered by the price fluctuation and donations to her non-profit haven\u2019t really been affected.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is not a game for you to win quick, free money, and that is the mentality we are working to combat. Sometimes people are short-sighted, and understandably so, because they need money and they need it fast, which is what causes a lot of the problems we keep hearing about. The goal of many people using Bitcoin is to save for the long term, and going by that, Bitcoin is the best currency to do that with. You might say the dollar or pound are better but even those currencies are currently being racked by inflation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ensure that we tell people in our communities to only invest money for the long-term and not the one they need immediately. Don\u2019t risk all your money just because you\u2019re looking for quick returns. Bitcoin has a lot of functionality, but it is not a get-rich-quick scheme,\u201d she shared.\n\nAnita Posch at a Bitcoin workshop\n\nPosch\u2019s Bitcoin platform, Crack The Orange, teaches people about the complexities of Bitcoin and its uses. For her, it is crucial at this stage where there are a lot of wrong assumptions about the currency and a lot of ignorance surrounding its potential.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked on Bitcoin education and have reached hundreds of people. However, the point of this is to build something that\u2019s long-lasting and sustainable because there\u2019s only so much that I can do. I\u2019m doing this so that people from these communities can learn themselves even when I\u2019m not there, and even teach others. There are a lot of opportunities for people who understand Bitcoin out there and my goal is to get people enlightened and possibly plugged into these opportunities.\u201d\n\nAll across Africa, there are people like Posch, who still believe in the power of Bitcoin, regardless of the scandals and fluctuations in price. Abubakar Nur Khalil, CEO of Bitcoin VC firm, Recursive Capital is one of such people. According to Khalil, a big mistake that the Bitcoin community made was allowing themselves to be lumped into a broader crypto industry.\n\n\u201cThis kind of framing harms people, as they are often unfamiliar with the technicalities behind how projects, including Bitcoin, work and their differences, which encourages misinformation. This misinformation puts unsuspecting people on a path of becoming bankrupt, ultimately disillusioned with the space, uninterested in any legitimate benefits of Bitcoin, and only poisons the well,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAccording to them, their operations as a Bitcoin organisation have continued per usual despite everything that has happened. In his article, Khalil shared that there has even been a significant increase in the quality of projects that come through their pipeline. \u201cPreviously, the messaging of \u2018crypto VC\u2019 only filled our inbox with projects that were either outright scams, well-dressed yet-to-be-uncovered scams, or impractical ideas.\u201d\n\nFor years now, Bitcoin maximalists have insisted on a large difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, asserting that Bitcoin is the only digital currency worth paying attention to. In this article from the Bitcoin Magazine, Jimmy Song writes that \u201cBitcoin is the original and very different from \u2018crypto\u2019 projects, which are all basically cheap knockoffs. Bitcoin has no central controller, there aren\u2019t misaligned incentives, the people involved have no special rights and there\u2019s no marketing team.\u201d According to Bitcoiners, it is this difference that will make Bitcoin stand the test of time and continue to operate even while the price is shaky.\n\nFor Heritage Falodun, the founder of the Bitcoin advocacy community, DigiOats, they\u2019ve been working extra hard to shift the interest in Bitcoin beyond being an investment with the possibility of high returns to its other functionalities like facilitating financial innovation. According to Falodun, the bubble of crypto has burst and a lot more people are open-eyed and more critical of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cWe have to teach people how to protect themselves from centralised exchanges in terms of creating private keys to store their Bitcoin. These days, it is not enough to just tell people revolutionary objectives or theories like \u2018Bitcoin has the potential to change lives\u2019, you have to show them how and give realistic, practical examples. Bitcoin advocacy now involves doing the actual work, and although the adoption rates have slowed due to all the recent happenings\u2014 including the forex exchange rates, we\u2019re doing the work to advocate for more innovation as opposed to only ways people can make a profit,\u201d he shared with TechCabal.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology is truly innovative and has become a game-changer in the finance world, a considerable amount of interest in the currency stemmed from its potential to yield high returns as quickly as possible and its promise of decentralisation. In the past year, a lot of faith and interest in Bitcoin has waned, and this shift in public perception will undoubtedly affect what Bitcoin advocacy on the continent looks like in the future.\n\nHave you got your tickets to TechCabal\u2019s Moonshot Conference?

        "content": "In recent weeks, Bitcoin (BTC) has encountered a formidable downturn, with its value receding to approximately $26,000. This comes barely a month after the cryptocurrency tantalizingly grazed the $30,000 milestone.\n\nThe journey downhill can be attributed to a blend of factors, encompassing dwindling market participation, the absence of significant advancements concerning the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), and rare reports indicating that SpaceX, helmed by Elon Musk, reduced its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nSeeking further insights regarding BTC\u2019s future price trajectory, Finbold consulted with Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) artificial intelligence (AI) bot, Google Bard, on August 25.\n\nNotably, we asked Bard to predict how much Bitcoin\u2019s price will fall in 2023, and outline key factors that could make a notable impact on its price action.\n\nBard\u2019s response\n\nFirstly, Google Bard stressed that the direction of Bitcoin\u2019s price in the coming months is uncertain because it depends on a high number of factors. In addition, Bitcoin is still a volatile asset, the chatbot noted, meaning it can undergo sharp price changes in a brief period of time.\n\nNevertheless, Bard predicted that the average lowest price Bitcoin could hit in 2023 is $20,759, citing an analysis of multiple financial experts. The consensus projection is based on the lowest estimates of $12,000 and the highest of $30,000, Bard noted.\n\n\u201cAccording to the experts I have researched, the average lowest price that they think Bitcoin will reach by year-end 2023 is US$20,759. Some are more bearish and believe it could drop as low as US$12,000. However, there are also some experts who are more bullish and believe that Bitcoin could reach US$30,000 or even higher by the end of the year.\u201d \u2013 Bard said in its response.\n\nMeanwhile, at press time, BTC was changing hands at $26,099, down 1.4% on the day. The maiden crypto asset gained less than 1% over the past week while losing more than 10% on the month.\n\nFactors that could influence BTC price\n\nIn its extensive response, Bard said there is a combination of factors that could influence Bitcoin\u2019s price in 2023, both positively and negatively.\n\nNotably, the chatbot highlighted that Bitcoin has been in a bear market since late 2021, and it is possible that the market could continue experiencing a downturn in the coming months.\n\nSome of the factors that could contribute to this scenario are sticky inflation drivers, which could force the US Federal Reserve to continue hiking interest rates, even after bringing them to the highest level in more than 20 years.\n\nAdditionally, increased regulatory scrutiny could also have an adverse impact on crypto prices, Bard noted.\n\n\u201cThis could make it more difficult for people to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and could also lead to a decline in their price.\u201d \u2013 Bard added.\n\nOn a positive note, the AI bot outlined several potential catalysts for Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory throughout the remainder of 2023.\n\n\n\nThese include increased adoptions by major institutions such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and MicroStrategy, as well as growing institutional adoption that could be fueled by the launch of a new Bitcoin ETF.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
