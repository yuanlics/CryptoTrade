        "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: Celebrating the $250 Million Pizza Order - Investopedia",
        "content": "Each year, May 22 marks the anniversary of when a Florida man paid for two pizzas in the first Bitcoin transaction. The day has become legendary, less because it was the first commercial use of bitcoins, but because of Bitcoin\u2019s worth in the following years. For the two pizzas, the man in question paid 10,000 bitcoins, which, as of Sept. 11, 2023, is worth over $250 million.\n\nOn May 22, 2010, now known as \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day,\u201d Laszlo Hanyecz, the Florida man, agreed to pay 10,000 bitcoins for the delivery of two Papa John\u2019s pizzas. On the Bitcoin Talk forum, Hanyecz reached out for help. \u201cI\u2019ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas \u2026 like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day,\u201d Hanyecz wrote.\n\n\u201cI like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I\u2019m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don\u2019t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a \u2018breakfast platter\u2019 at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you\u2019re happy!\u201d\n\nA British man took up Hanyecz\u2019s offer and bought the two pizzas for him in exchange for 10,000 bitcoins. Even then, the recipient of the bitcoins got a bargain, paying $25 for the pizzas, while 10,000 bitcoins were then worth around $41.\n\nSince that purchase, Hanyeczs\u2019 pizzas have become far more costly. Nine months after the purchase, Bitcoin reached parity with the U.S. dollar, making the two pizzas worth $10,000. In 2015, the fifth anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day, the two pizzas were valued at $2.4 million. On May 22, 2023, Bitcoin was at just over $26,850, making the pizzas worth \u2026 you get the point.\n\nDespite the massive rise in the price of Bitcoin, Hanyecz says he is not phased about his deal. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,\u201d Hanyecz has said.\n\nWhat Was Bitcoin's Highest Price? As of September 2023, Bitcoin reached its all-time peak in November 2021, exceeding $65,000 per bitcoin.\n\nWhat Type of Transaction Is Bitcoin Mostly Used for? Bitcoin is primarily used for digital transactions. This includes ecommerce purchases, peer-to-peer transfers, and cross-border payments. Moreover, it's used for international transactions and, increasingly, for banking by those who don't have access to traditional financial institutions. Among these transactions, though, are those linked with illicit activities, such as darknet trades.\n\nWhat Is the Average Number of Bitcoin Transactions Daily? As of 2023, there are an average of almost 500,000 Bitcoin transactions within the blockchain per day, a significant increase from previous years. This surge reflects the growing adoption and use of Bitcoin for digital transactions across the globe.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin's value has gone up significantly since the first Bitcoin Pizza Day, illustrating the cryptocurrency's impressive growth since its early days, when its worth was fungible for not more than a couple of pizzas. The rise in Bitcoin's value is a testament to its increasing acceptance and use in digital transactions worldwide. However, Bitcoin has been highly volatile. Its price can fluctuate rapidly, potentially leading to momentous gains and significant losses. Thus, while the growth trajectory of Bitcoin attracts investors, caution and informed decision-making are paramount when investing in this cryptocurrency because of its elevated risk."

        "content": "The largest crypto exchange in the United States announced on Thursday that Bermuda\u2019s financial regulator has given it the green light to let retail traders outside the U.S. buy and sell perpetual futures.\n\nAs of Thursday, small-time investors, as opposed to only deep-pocketed institutional traders, will be able to apply to trade the risky financial products, which allow investors to speculate on the future price of an asset. Trading will begin in the coming weeks, Coinbase said in a blog post announcing the Bermuda news.\n\n\u201cWe chose to build our business and become a public company in the U.S. believing that the U.S. should be at the forefront of efforts to update our financial system,\u201d wrote the exchange.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s move to open up its international exchange to small investors is the latest in the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to expand its footprint beyond the U.S. where it has faced growing regulatory scrutiny.\n\nFollowing the collapse of competing exchange FTX and the arrest of its now-disgraced CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, the Securities and Exchange Commission soon cracked down on a slew of high-profile crypto companies and founders, including Genesis, Gemini, Justin Sun, the crypto celebrity behind TRON, and Do Kwon, creator of the so-called stablecoin TerraUSD.\n\nIn March, Coinbase, which has long styled itself as the white knight of the crypto industry, revealed that it has also become the target of impending SEC litigation after it received a so-called Wells Notice, which informs companies that they are the targets of soon-to-be litigation.\n\nShortly after, the U.S.-based exchange, headed by CEO Brian Armstrong, announced that it had received regulatory approval in Bermuda to operate an offshore exchange, and in May, the publicly traded company unveiled Coinbase International Exchange for the use of institutional investors.\n\nThe SEC eventually filed an outright lawsuit against Coinbase in June, but that hasn\u2019t stopped billions of dollars of crypto from flowing through both its domestic and offshore entities. Its Bermuda outpost has seen $5.5 billion in trading volume\u2014strictly from institutional investors\u2014as of the second quarter of 2023. (By comparison, Coinbase reported $92 billion in total trading volume in the same period.)"

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs: A $600B tipping point for crypto - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A United States appellate court directed the Securities and Exchange Commission in August to reassess its denial of Grayscale\u2019s application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). A little-noted consequence of that decision is that it could open the floodgates for $600 billion in new cash to enter the cryptocurrency market.\n\nETFs provide investors with a regulated way to gain exposure to different asset classes, including Bitcoin (BTC). The approval of a Bitcoin ETF could democratize investment in the cryptocurrency sector, drawing parallels to how the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF and the VanEck Brazil Small-Cap ETF have democratized investing in the Brazilian market.\n\nDespite some hurdles, market analysts anticipate potential Bitcoin ETF approval by early 2024. A Bitcoin ETF could unlock an estimated $600 billion in new demand, according to a September report by analysts at Bernstein, more than doubling the approximately $550 billion fully diluted market cap at which Bitcoin stands today.\n\nRelated: 10 years later, still no Bitcoin ETF \u2014 but who cares?\n\nHowever, these predictions are speculative, with the actual outcome depending on various factors such as market dynamics, company strategies and regulatory responses. Notably, the SEC has delayed the decision on Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF application several times already. In August, Wood expressed her expectation for these delays, stating that she believed the SEC would approve multiple Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously. But on Sept. 26, the SEC extended the decision period further, to Jan. 10.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s delays and rejections of Bitcoin ETF applications have drawn criticism and fueled investor frustration. A bipartisan group of lawmakers urged Gensler this month to grant immediate approval for an ETF, arguing that post-Grayscale court decision, there\u2019s no reason to deny spot crypto ETFs, which they believe would enhance investor safeguards. This congressional pressure further complicates the path to Bitcoin ETF approval, adding to the uncertainty as the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF decision date approaches.\n\nIn tandem with the SEC\u2019s deliberations over Bitcoin ETFs, major players in the crypto industry are actively lobbying for new rules. Coinbase, for instance, is spearheading one of the largest lobbying pushes in the crypto industry, aiming to garner support among lawmakers for the introduction of new regulations. As we continue to observe these unfolding developments, it becomes increasingly clear that the future of crypto regulations is being hotly contested.\n\nRecent developments suggest more potential delays in the approval of Bitcoin ETFs on the whole. James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, speculated that the SEC\u2019s recent decisions may have dampened prospects for ETF approval in 2023. Filings from major players such as BlackRock, Bitwise and Wisdomtree are slated for review in the third week of October. However, the SEC\u2019s recent actions on ARK 21Shares have sparked speculation that other filings due for review in mid-October \u2014 including those from VanEck, Invesco, Fidelity and Valkyrie \u2014 could also experience delays. So, it remains to be seen whether there will be any significant updates on these applications soon.\n\nTo better understand the implications of these ETFs, let\u2019s delve into the concept of assets under management (AUM), which represents the total market value of the financial assets an entity or adviser manages on behalf of their clients. This crucial metric in the investment world serves as an indicator of performance. Consider the following table for more insight.\n\nFinancial institutions with higher AUM, like BlackRock, could generate more revenue from management fees if they successfully launch a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAs competition in the Bitcoin ETF market intensifies, it may drive down management fees, impacting revenue.\n\nInvestment firms charge these fees for managing funds, typically ranging from 0.2% to 2%. A trend of decreasing management fees has been observed recently due to increased competition, cost-effective investment strategies and investor demand for transparency.\n\nHow does Grayscale generate revenue from ETFs?\n\nGrayscale generates its revenue from its exchange-traded funds, such as the proposed Bitcoin ETF, through management fees. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the total AUM.\n\nFor its existing product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the company charges an annual fee of 2%.\n\nLet\u2019s break down how this works with some real numbers. If we take the reported $16.2 billion in assets in the Bitcoin Trust and apply the 2% management fee, it means that Grayscale would generate $324 million per year in management fees from the Bitcoin Trust alone.\n\nIf Grayscale succeeds in converting GBTC to a Bitcoin ETF, the AUM could potentially increase due to the appeal of ETFs to institutional investors, boosting management fees. However, Grayscale plans to lower fees upon conversion to an ETF, although specific figures have not been provided.\n\nRelated: BlackRock\u2019s misguided effort to create \u2018Crypto for Dummies\u2019\n\nThe conversion is subject to SEC approval. Grayscale recently won a legal case against the SEC, paving the way for spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Simultaneously, the SEC extended its decision-making period on ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBitcoin ETF approval would be a significant step toward mainstream crypto acceptance. The court ruling questions the SEC\u2019s sole authority over digital assets, suggesting other entities like courts and Congress can influence crypto regulations. This could lead to wider crypto acceptance, making Bitcoin investing more accessible and regulated, attracting more capital to the crypto market.\n\nThe potential approval could also have geopolitical implications, setting a precedent for other countries and accelerating global adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nOf course, numerous hurdles remain, notwithstanding the court\u2019s ruling. But it signified progress, and rewards await those ready to embrace change.\n\nConstantin Kogan is a co-founder of BullPerks and GamesPad, a partner at BitBull Capital, the founder of Adwivo and a former managing director at Wave Financial.

        "title": "What Historically Happens to Bitcoin During a US Government Shutdown? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Bitcoin is a digital asset that is well-known for its durability and independence from traditional financial systems. However, even this decentralized powerhouse is vulnerable to the effects of big external events, such as US government shutdowns. We'll look at previous occurrences, the cryptocurrency's behavior, and the lessons learnt from these events to better understand the historical relationships between Bitcoin and US government shutdowns.\n\nThe Coincidence of Bitcoin and Government Shutdowns\n\nWhen the US Congress fails to pass legislation funding federal agencies and services, the government shuts down. Non-essential government services are temporarily halted during such times, and federal employees may be furloughed or work without pay. These occurrences are frequently the result of political deadlock and fiscal conflicts.\n\nAs a decentralized digital money, Bitcoin works independently of government control. Market forces, supply and demand dynamics, and investor mood all influence its value. The bitcoin market, however, is not insulated from the broader financial environment, and events such as government shutdowns can have repercussions.\n\nGovernment shutdowns and market turpitude\n\nIncreased market uncertainty is one prominent characteristic of Bitcoin's behavior during US government shutdowns. As the shutdown's duration and possible economic consequences remain unknown, investors and traders may become more risk-averse. This sentiment may spread to the bitcoin market, increasing price volatility.\n\nBitcoin has historically seen price changes during government shutdowns, with both upward and downward moves. The magnitude and direction of these price swings are frequently determined by a variety of factors, such as global economic conditions, investor sentiment, and the overall stability of financial markets.\n\nIs Bitcoin a Safe Haven?\n\nDuring times of economic and political crisis, Bitcoin has been promoted as a \"safe haven\" asset, similar to gold. Proponents believe that because of its decentralized nature and limited supply, it is an appealing store of value when traditional assets, such as fiat currencies or stocks, confront uncertainty.\n\nSome investors may flock to Bitcoin during government shutdowns as a hedge against potential economic disruptions. This inflow of cash has the potential to enhance demand and, as a result, put upward pressure on Bitcoin's price. However, it is important to emphasize that Bitcoin's designation as a safe haven asset is debatable, and its behavior can vary from crisis to crisis.\n\nA potential surge?\n\nThe looming threat of a United States government shutdown and debt ceiling standoff has once again sparked interest in Bitcoin's price performance. Historically, Bitcoin has responded positively to economic uncertainties, particularly during government shutdowns, witnessing price increases. However, the question on many minds is whether the current political deadlock will lead to a significant Bitcoin price surge.\n\nBitcoin's response to past government shutdowns has been mixed. For example, during the 2013 shutdown, Bitcoin's price surged over 80%, while during the 2018-2019 shutdown, its gains were more modest. The 2013 rally saw Bitcoin's price jump from around $133 to over $1,000, while during the 2018-2019 shutdown, its price increased from $3,207 to $4,244, but with higher volatility.\n\nBitcoin's price behavior during government shutdowns remains uncertain, but its potential as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty continues to attract attention and speculation from investors worldwide. As the U.S. grapples with its current challenges, all eyes are on Bitcoin to see how it responds to the evolving economic landscape.\n\nHistorical Illustrations\n\nTo obtain insight on Bitcoin's behavior during government shutdowns, let's look at two recent shutdowns:\n\n1. The Government Shutdown of 2013:\n\nDue to differences over the federal budget, the US government shut down for 16 days in 2013. During this time, Bitcoin saw significant price volatility. The price of cryptocurrencies fluctuated significantly, initially rising to record highs as some investors sought refuge in digital assets. However, as the closure continued, Bitcoin's price retraced, reflecting the concern in the broader market.\n\n2. The Government Shutdown of 2018-2019:\n\nThe 35-day government shutdown, which began in December 2018 and lasted until January 2019, was the longest in US history. During this time, Bitcoin's behavior was more nuanced. While there was fluctuation, there was no continuous trend. Some investors viewed Bitcoin as a viable hedge, while others remained cautious in the face of persistent economic concerns.\n\nImportant Takeaways\n\nSeveral major takeaways may be drawn from past data on Bitcoin's performance during US government shutdowns:\n\nIncreased Volatility: During government shutdowns, Bitcoin's price volatility often spikes, indicating market uncertainty and shifting investor opinion.\n\nMixed Reaction: The cryptocurrency's reaction to government shutdowns is not consistent. Depending on the circumstances, it might exhibit both upward and downward price swings.\n\nBitcoin is occasionally regarded as a potential hedge against economic turbulence, drawing investors looking for alternative assets during times of crisis.\n\nMarket Independence: Because Bitcoin is decentralized, it can operate independently of government activities, giving it some independence from existing financial institutions.\n\nBitcoin may reflect certain patterns during government shutdowns, but there are no certainties about how it will react in future occurrences. A complicated combination of factors influences the bitcoin market.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nAs the cryptocurrency world evolves, it is critical for investors and traders to approach Bitcoin and other digital assets with a comprehensive grasp of their distinct qualities. While past data might provide insights, it's crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is still in its early stages and can be influenced by a variety of internal and external factors.\n\nPrudent risk management measures are essential for people contemplating Bitcoin as part of their investing portfolio. Diversification, rigorous study, and a long-term view are useful strategies for navigating the volatility and flexibility of the bitcoin market.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin's interaction with US government shutdowns highlights its status as a dynamic and changing asset class. While it may show signs of resilience and hedging potential, it is nevertheless vulnerable to the broader dynamics that affect financial markets. As government shutdowns and other external events continue, the cryptocurrency market's reaction will be widely followed, providing vital insight into Bitcoin's increasing role in the global financial scene."

        "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States have already witnessed tremendous growth, and now there\u2019s an increasing number of solid applications to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs by some of the largest traditional financial institutions.\n\nBy taking those two factors into account, along with Grayscale's recent court battle win and Franklin Templeton's spot Bitcoin ETF application, it seems that it\u2019s a matter of when spot Bitcoin ETFs will be available to investors rather than if this will happen.\n\nWhen they\u2019re available, they will help to streamline and facilitate mainstream institutional adoption of digital assets in the United States.\n\nETF Growth in the United States and World\n\nETFs can be a logical choice for investors: cost-efficient and easily accessible.

According to BlackRock\u2014which shows a global total of $10T USD in ETFs in 2022\u2014this financial product could reach $14T in value, worldwide, by the end of 2024.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs are a natural progression in this financial product.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nAlthough debate still exists about whether a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States would create a pathway to mainstream crypto adoption, many people in the digital asset world are increasingly optimistic\u2014both about the potential for approval and its impact.\n\nWe believe this approval will help to bring fresh capital into the market through demand for the product. Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow people to directly invest in Bitcoin in simplified ways. Investments are based on current market prices with the owners holding the crypto like they would a stock within the fund, which would make it feel familiar to people who are used to investing but new to crypto.\n\nThese opportunities already exist in Canada and are launching in Europe; currently, though, eyes are on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the spot Bitcoin ETF application from BlackRock\u2014which was quickly followed up by applications from additional traditional finance mainstays; the following have filed for a Nasdaq spot Bitcoin ETF listing: Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, and Bitwise.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo date, the SEC has not approved any spot Bitcoin ETF applications, citing market manipulation of Bitcoin prices as the primary reason for most rejections. BlackRock\u2019s (BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust application, though, contains an element that may cause the SEC to agree to the fund\u2019s creation: a proposed surveillance-sharing agreement with Nasdaq and a large U.S. digital asset exchange that will serve as a barrier against market manipulation.\n\nThis surveillance-sharing agreement would provide transparency in market trading and clearing activities as well as customer identification. Plus, if this approach meets the SEC\u2019s approval, it would serve as a guidebook for other companies to follow.\n\nOnce these spot ETFs are available, providing ease of investing in Bitcoin, it will naturally lead to more institutional flows of funds\u2014especially as the number of distribution sources increases. Because Bitcoin supply is limited to 21MM, this capped availability could provide a positive price action as increasing numbers of institutional investors have more seamless access to the coins.\n\nBecause the likelihood of SEC approval seems high, several major asset managers have recently applied to offer Ethereum ETFs: Van Eck, Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Grayscale, Roundhill, and Proshares.\n\nHedge Funds Increasing Exposure to Digital Assets\n\nOn a related topic, \u201cRebuilding confidence in crypto: 5th Annual Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report (2023)\u201d notes how traditional hedge funds have continued to look at increasing their digital asset exposure despite the volatile 2022 environment.\n\nMore than half of the traditional hedge funds currently investing in crypto-assets intend to maintain the same levels of capital deployed this year while nearly half (46 percent) intend to deploy more capital into this asset class by the end of 2023. Notably, none of the respondents said they planned to reduce their exposure.\n\nCrypto curiosity has edged up among those funds not yet investing in crypto-assets. More than one-third (37 percent) of survey respondents confirm that they\u2019re simply waiting for further maturity before investing\u2014with more than two-thirds (69 percent) of the curious survey participants being hedge funds managing over a billion dollars.\n\nOptimism about the future reigns: 93 percent of crypto hedge funds expect crypto-asset market capitalization to be higher at the end of 2023 than it was at the end of 2022.\n\nAs for the investors in crypto hedge funds, they want the following: mandatory asset segregation; mandatory financial audits; independent statements of reserve assets; and platform security. To further build confidence with these investors, the hedge fund industry is increasing their use of standard liquidity management tools and enhancing their counterparty risk management policies. They\u2019re focusing on optimal custody solutions, and use for third-party custodians is strong with 80 percent of crypto and traditional hedge funds selecting this as their primary custody route.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s proposed rule on qualified custodians would further regulations in that direction, appropriately segregating assets and otherwise protecting investors\u2014which meshes with what the hedge fund industry and its investors desire in risk management.\n\nETFs Offer the Best Avenue to Traditional Financial Adoption Today\n\nSpot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs available through trusted traditional financial institutions will break down barriers and streamline mainstream adoption, helping investors navigate a crypto ecosystem that might seem complex and feel intimidating.\n\nOnce available through familiar traditional financial institutions, the process will feel more comfortable and welcoming. Some investors may limit digital asset exposure to ETFs while others may ultimately expand beyond that into the broader world of crypto investing. Traditional asset managers increasing allocations to digital assets will also help to drive mainstream adoption going forward.\n\nAdam Sporn is BitGo\u2019s Head of Prime Brokerage and US Institutional Sales.\n\nRead the original post on The Defiant"

Regulators earlier this week had postponed a decision on a similar application from 21Shares and Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management.\n\nIndustry watchers are closely monitoring the race for a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF, given the winner is expected to enjoy a significant first-mover advantage. At least 10 firms currently have applications pending with the SEC, according to a tally from Bloomberg Intelligence. The ETFs would be physically backed by the largest virtual currency.\n\nThe SEC had already postponed decisions on applications from BlackRock, Invesco, Bitwise and Valkyrie in August. It has also denied numerous past applications, citing scams and market manipulation among reasons as to why such ETFs shouldn\u2019t trade in the U.S.\n\nBut a recent legal victory in federal court by Grayscale Investments, another firm seeking to debut a Bitcoin ETF, has fueled speculation among market watchers that such a structure would soon be approved.\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, on Thursday traded around $27,000. It hit a record high of around $69,000 in 2021."

        "content": "Three finalists have been selected for the Bitcoin Alpha Competition, a crowd-sourced campaign to find the next top Bitcoin fund manager. The manager with the most promising approach for generating alpha in the bitcoin market will be awarded $1 million USD in seed capital and announced on the Main Stage of the Bitcoin Amsterdam Conference on Friday, October 13th by Samara Alpha Management.\n\n\n\nSamara Alpha Management and Bitcoin Magazine PRO reviewed more than 150 applications from traditional finance and digital asset fund managers, and have selected the following finalists: Andrey Aakelyan (Theta Digital), Jaron Abbott (Armor Strategy), and Maximilian Pace (Animus Technologies). Of these three, one winner will walk away with one million dollars in seed funding \u2013 as well as all the necessary operational infrastructure to launch and run their fund strategy \u2013 thanks to the generous support of Samara Alpha Management and their signature seeding platform.\n\n\n\nBelow are insights into each of the finalists\u2019 fund strategies:\n\n\n\nAndrey Arakelyan - Theta Digital\n\nTheta Digital is focused on taking discretionary Long or Short positions in Bitcoin Futures at varying timescales to achieve incremental alpha denominated in BTC preserved by systematic risk management.\n\nJaron Abbott - Armor Strategies\n\nThe Armor Strategy utilizes a portfolio of indicators to quantitatively describe and measure the psychological behavior of panic selling in its early stages. Signals are aggregated and translated to predict and extract alpha from impending price moves.\n\nMaximilian Pace - Animus Technologies\n\nAnimus Technologies is an AI-platform designed to develop data-driven trading strategies for cryptocurrencies. The result, developed over the past 6 years, is a systematic solution to reducing market volatility and enhancing investor returns over market cycles.\n\n\n\nBitcoin Magazine spoke with Roy Tse, Chief Risk Officer at Samara Alpha Management, for his thoughts on the competition and why Samara Alpha Management has made such a decisive move into the Bitcoin ecosystem:\n\n\u201cWe have a belief that we can find interesting managers that are really adding accretive value to the Bitcoin space. At Samara, a lot of us believe in the power of Bitcoin and what it can do for the world.\n\nEvery day, we hear tons of great investment ideas and strategies. Given the current regulatory environment, and the disjointed-ness of the exchanges and markets, that is why many of these market opportunities emerge, similar to the early days of other traditional finance businesses that we\u2019ve seen such as mortgage-backed trading and CLOs. Any time there is a new industry, there is a chance for novel financial strategies to succeed. But, to capitalize on that, the difficulty lies in the environment to set up the required infrastructure in such a new market, like Bitcoin and digital assets.\n\nWe are Bitcoin maximalists, we want to increase adoption. If folks can\u2019t enter the market because of things like setting up their fund, or not knowing who to call \u2013 those are the pressure points we want to alleviate.\n\nBecause of that, we created the Samara seeding platform, which is essentially a fund in a box. We provide the ability for a manager to come in with a great idea and subscribe to a technology platform complete with all of the different disciplines needed to set up a Bitcoin investment management company. You have fund administrator connectivity with data coming through from the exchanges, pre-existing exchange partners and accounts, risk management functions complete with analytics, calculations and customization, liquidity management functions etc.\n\nThe million dollar prize for the Bitcoin Alpha Competition is very exciting for us, but the true excitement we have is for the seeding platform \u2014 being able to provide this functionality to fund managers with great strategies and helping them bring their ideas to life at the push of a button.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the crowning of the Bitcoin Alpha Competition winner at Bitcoin Amsterdam fast approaching, stay tuned for the announcement on Friday, October 13th for who will take home the $1 million prize as well as full access to Samara\u2019s fund management platform.\n\n\n\nFor media inquiries and additional information on the competition, please contact: kristyna.mazankova@btcmedia.org\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Why Cryptocurrencies Like Bitcoin and Ethereum Surged Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nThursday was a fine day for cryptocurrencies nearly across the board, with the sector's leaders driving the rally. No. 1 and No. 2 -- respectively, Bitcoin (BTC -1.43%) and Ethereum (ETH -2.09%) -- were trading around 3% higher over the 24 hours preceding late afternoon.\n\nAs the top dogs go, the remaining pack typically follows, so a host of other coins, tokens, and related assets also moved higher, albeit at different paces. Fellow crypto Aave (AAVE -2.42%) was enjoying a nearly 9% surge, while miner Riot Platforms (RIOT -6.39%) was defying gravity at a nearly 5% clip.\n\nSo what\n\nThe trajectory of cryptocurrencies (and stocks closely tied to them, like Riot Platforms) frequently depends on the performance of low-risk assets. When the latter start to weaken, this emboldens certain investors to stack up on the riskier goodies, and coins and tokens are still considered to be model high-risk plays.\n\nOn Thursday, those safe havens weren't looking infallible. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, considered by many to be the most secure investment on the scene, weakened from a 16-year high on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, everybody's favorite fossil fuel investment, crude oil, also saw a price retreat (in its case, from year-to-date highs). Finally, the reserve currency of this planet (the U.S. dollar) lost a bit of its value too.\n\nThese weren't the only factors driving Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their many relatives higher on the day.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) late Wednesday, Bloomberg reporter Eric Balchunas wrote that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is making moves to accelerate the rollout of certain Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Specifically, according to Balchunas, the SEC has requested ETF filers to update their applications in an effort to get those instruments up and running for trading next week.\n\nWhile this apparently only concerns Ethereum ETFs, it's easy to imagine that if the regulator is ready to turn on the light for that crypto, it's ready to do so for a host of other coins and tokens. There still is much crypto resistance in official corners -- particularly at the SEC, ahem -- but at least to some degree, it seems to be melting a bit.\n\nNow what\n\nOther factors playing in the background are also contributing to the current crypto bullishness. The equity market continues to be generally frothy, which not only fuels optimism for riskier assets but also gets investors to consider non-stock plays like cryptocurrencies. Interest rates remain relatively high and look set to stay that way for some time or even rise. So, we likely haven't seen the last good day for coins and tokens."

        "content": "Patient bitcoin investors may have to hold their composure for at least another quarter as the Federal Reserve's outlook on interest rate policy dampens what might have been an even stronger month for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has had a difficult but decent year so far. The flagship cryptocurrency is up more than 60% for the year, according to Coin Metrics, thanks to a big run up in the first quarter. Not much has happened since, however. Bitcoin is down about 5% since April 1, and subsequent gains from any of several positive developments in the industry this year \u2013 like Ripple's win in the SEC's lawsuit against it, Grayscale's victory in its SEC suit, and several financial giants putting their names in the hat for a bitcoin ETF \u2013 have failed to hold. In the final quarter of the year, bitcoin is likely to see continued chop and although there's room for some upside, it may be limited. \"If we have positive ETF developments, I could see us going back to the top of the range that we saw this year,\" said Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto data provider Amberdata. Bitcoin has traded in a narrow range of between $25,000 and $30,000 since about March. A bitcoin ETF getting the green light is widely regarded as a key event that would push bitcoin to a new high and bring liquidity and trading volumes back into crypto. Read more from CNBC Pro's Quarterly Investment Guide Wall Street sees the market's bumpy ride continuing in the 4th quarter. Here are the risks in store Danger, 'pothole' ahead: Economic growth slowing to a near-halt to end the year Oil prices and the dollar surged in the third quarter. These ETFs can help you reset your portfolio After a rough third quarter, here's what to expect from technology stocks into the end of 2023 These underperforming stocks are due for a fourth-quarter comeback, according to Wall Street Supply cuts from Saudi Arabia remain price drivers for oil heading into the fourth quarter \"One of the big problems with us breaking out into new high territories is we still have this backdrop of a hawkish Fed that's dragging on risk assets across the board,\" he added. \"A crypto-specific catalyst could bring us up to the top of that range, but the macro is still a headwind. That probably prevents us from breaking to new highs on the year.\" Last week, at the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting, the central bank hit pause on rate hikes but indicated it could hold rates at higher levels for longer than previously thought. Rob Ginsberg, a chart analyst at Wolfe Research, said he wouldn't be surprised to see bitcoin break below $25,000, a key support level for the cryptocurrency, when rates break out to new cycle highs. When the Fed pivots on rate hikes, investors could expect a \"violent\" rotation back into risk , he said. Still, bitcoin is currently on pace to end September, typically its worst month of the year, up more than 3%. That would mark its first positive month in the quarter. Typically, it has ended the month in the red in eight of the last 10 years, according to CoinGlass. Despite this, it remains on pace for an 11% decline in the third quarter, historically a weaker quarter for the cryptocurrency. That would make it its sixth third-quarter loss in 11 years. Bitcoin is entering a historically upbeat period. The cryptocurrency has posted a monthly gain in eight out of the last 10 Octobers and a fourth-quarter gain in six of the last 10 years. Blame it on interest rates In a year when the Fed has continued to raise rates \u2013 and following a year when its rate hiking drove much of bitcoin's price \u2013 inflation data and monetary policy haven't been big drivers for bitcoin the way industry-specific catalysts have been. That influence may be back in play in Q4, however, after it hinted at higher rates for longer last week. \"The Fed has put markets and the economy in conservation mode by forcing investors to make hard choices with their money, and it reminded us last week that they may not switch back to innovation mode any time soon,\" said Callie Cox, analyst at investment company eToro. \"People are more concerned about protecting their portfolios than taking a shot at the next, hot thing in crypto. That's weighed on trading volumes, liquidity and speculation within the industry.\" With bitcoin as the digital gold play for investors and ether as the crypto tech play, higher rates could continue to weigh more heavily on ether, which is up about half as much as bitcoin in 2023 and on pace to post a more than 13% loss for the quarter. Meanwhile, holding a non-yielding asset like gold or bitcoin could become \"less interesting\" as rates go higher, Amberdata's Magadini said. BTC.CM= ETH.CM= YTD mountain Bitcoin's biggest gains may be in for the year, but there's still some room for more limited upside in Q4. But that could be good for bitcoin, which is sitting in the middle of a shift from speculative to quality investments, according to Cox. While bitcoin as a risky investment to traditional-minded investors lining it up against stocks and bonds, for the crypto-focused investor, bitcoin is a relatively stable store of value and a hedge against the traditional financial system, which has shown cracks this year that supported that narrative. There's a significant crowd on both sides, Cox said \u2013 \"that's why bitcoin is up 60% in a year when the Fed has hiked interest rates so aggressively.\" \"Bitcoin is at levels where it could struggle technically, but in a weird way, you may continue to see money flow into well-known cryptocurrencies because of the focus on quality,\" said Cox. \"That's the story of the fourth quarter: how does the appetite for quality collide with the appetite for speculation? The answer to that depends on interest rates, which will probably stay high.\""

A breakdown from this level means BTC price will see $21,500 as the next major support level, down 17.75% from current levels.\n\nStrong dollar adds to Bitcoin\u2019s downside risks\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback\u2019s strength against a pool of top foreign currencies, has reached its highest level since November 2022.\n\nThe index has been negatively correlated with Bitcoin throughout 2023, as shown below.\n\nBTC/USD vs. DXY weekly price chart.

        "title": "3 reasons why Bitcoin miners are selling BTC \u2014 and why it's not capitulation - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Crypto analysts, traders and anonymous influencer Bitcoin pundits on X (formerly known as Twitter) frequently interpret what Bitcoin miners do with their block rewards as a sentiment gauge for where Bitcoin's price might go.\n\nAccording to the theory, Bitcoin (BTC) miners sending rewards to exchanges foreshadows pending sell pressure on the asset\u2019s price and possibly reflects distress among miners.\n\nSeveral publicly listed Bitcoin miners challenged aspects of this methodology at last week\u2019s Bitmain World Digital Mining Summit (WDMS) in Hong Kong at a panel hosted by Cointelegraph\u2019s head of markets, Ray Salmond.\n\nBitmain WDMS panel on Bitcoin mining and renewable energy. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nAccording to Jeff Pratt, Core Scientific\u2019s senior vice president of growth and partnerships, \u201cCore Scientific might be the poster child for the hodl strategy. We built a 10,000 Bitcoin hoard, and we rode it up to the top, and then it led to some financial struggles that we are trying to emerge from now. So, what we\u2019re doing today, we sell our Bitcoin production each day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it goes back to those three things: How and where can you drive costs out, how and where do you drive efficiency up, and what are the new financial innovations that you can bring to your treasury or to your power programs to basically stabilize your overall companies\u2019 profitability.\u201d\n\nPanelists Taylor Monnig of CleanSpark and Will Roberts of Iris Energy agreed with Pratt, mentioning that their respective companies also sell a majority of their mined BTC.\n\n\u201cCleanSpark\u2019s strategy was wildly different, right? So we were very conservative during the bull market, and we got a lot of grief for that,\u201d Monnig said. \u201cWe sold Bitcoin all the way at the top at $60K, and we got a lot of grief for that as well. But, I think everybody has kinda seen our strategy pay off this year with the expansion that we\u2019ve taken to 9.5 exahashes, and now we\u2019re starting to increase our hold, as you guys have probably seen over the last couple of months now that Bitcoin price is at a much lower rate.\" Monnig added:\n\n\u201cWe took a lot more conservative approach in the bull market. Building in the bear has been the motto inside our company, and I think we will continue to expand on that. I think people learned a lot over the last market cycle, and I think the CleanSpark strategy will be adopted by a lot of the other miners moving forward.\u201d\n\nRoberts shared, \u201dWe\u2019ve sold all our Bitcoin daily since we started mining. I mean, our view of this is mining Bitcoin and operating data centers is a very different business model to investing in an asset like Bitcoin. We\u2019re in the business of generating shareholder value. What we\u2019re good at is operating data centers, generating cash flows for investors.\u201d Roberts added:\n\n\u201cOur view is that we can actually generate more value by selling a Bitcoin today and earning that Bitcoin, plus some back in the future, and we\u2019ve got the opportunity and the expansion capabilities to do that, or at some stage in the future potentially paying out a dividend, whether it\u2019s cash or Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAccording to TeraWulf co-founder Nazar Khan, \u201cThe last bull market seems like two lifetimes ago. So any approaches that we had then I think are long gone, and we\u2019ve kinda tweaked and modified where we\u2019re at.\u201d Khan added:\n\n\u201cSimilar to some of the other folks here, we\u2019ve been selling every Bitcoin that we produce, and fundamentally we at TeraWulf think we\u2019re a converter. We\u2019re taking a kilowatt hour of power, running it through the wonderful ASICs that Bitmain makes and producing hash on the back end. Every single day, how we judge this is how efficient we are in that conversion process. We tell our investors that we\u2019re converters and measure us on how efficient we are in that conversion process and that means we monetize every Bitcoin we sell on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners double down on efficiency and renewable energy at the World Digital Mining Summit\n\nSo, are Bitcoin analysts doing it all wrong?\n\nWhen questioned on the accuracy and methodology of on-chain metrics like Charles Edward\u2019s hash ribbons indicator, Khan quipped, \u201cI think that the business of being an analyst is an extremely difficult one because, by definition, you\u2019re probably wrong. Besides that, I think that historically, that might have been a good measure. Historically, when we were recognizing margins of 80%-plus, there wasn\u2019t a need to sell. You didn\u2019t need to monetize every Bitcoin that was produced.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think as we look at most of the companies today, given our growth plans that we have, the only source of income that we have is the margins that we have by mining Bitcoin or raising incremental capital, and the capital markets we use to grow our businesses have been tight the last couple of years,\u201d Khan added.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I think, at least for the publicly listed miners, looking at their Bitcoin selling strategies is not necessarily a direct indicator of capitulation or distress \u2014 it\u2019s more of how does that fit into where they sit today and where their growth plans are for tomorrow and how does that meet their capital needs.\u201d\n\nStatements from Foundry vice president Kevin Zhong also aligned with the perspectives of the publicly listed miners at the WDMS.\n\nFoundry senior vice president Kevin Zhang speaks about the Bitcoin halving. Source: Cointelegraph\n\n\u201cThe ideal scenario is to rely on our hopium that Bitcoin does go up and that our woes go away on their own, it's not guaranteed. The economic incentives of Bitcoin going alone may not be there or may come 6 months or 12 months after the halving. In that scenario, you\u2019ve got to get really creative. What do we do with block space, how do we drive fees up. What other ways are there to subsidize ourselves and subsidize miners. You also have to be very critical and strategic with what you do with the Bitcoin that you mine. Are you hedging it out, are you doing covered calls? What are your treasury plans? If you have a bullish outlook on Bitcoin are you going to be liquidating all of it or holding on to some of it. It requires a lot of stratification and models, endless models.\u201d\n\nTo hear the full conversation on Bitcoin miners\u2019 pivot to renewable energy, the growing synergy between energy producers and BTC miners and miners' views on the upcoming halving check out the WDMS panel here.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Why investors are taking bitcoin off exchanges - Yahoo Finance UK",
        "content": "Investors appear to be taking Bitcoin off exchanges. Illustration: Getty (Namthip Muanthongthae via Getty Images)\n\nAnalysis suggests investors are taking bitcoin off exchanges for long-term holding. In the past month, nearly 18,000 bitcoins, representing a decrease of nearly 1%, have been withdrawn from cryptocurrency exchanges, as per CryptoQuant data.\n\nThis suggests they want to hold the digital asset because they expect a future price rise.\n\nThe consensus amongst traders is that prices could rise if one of the spot bitcoin ETF applications that have been filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is approved.\n\nA spot bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) is a financial product that investors hope will open the gateway for mainstream capital to flood the crypto market.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETF delays\n\nHowever, this week US regulators chose to postpone making a decision on more of the ETF filings. This time it involved the highly anticipated ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn Tuesday the SEC delayed its ruling on the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, and a similar filing from fund manager Global X.\n\nArk Investment Management and 21Shares have been seeking an ETF approval since 2021. They made their latest spot bitcoin ETF application in April.\n\nAfter the filing, the SEC said it needed more time to rule, setting a deadline for November 11. However, the SEC said on Tuesday it would now take until January 10 to come to a decision on the application.\n\nRead more: Institutional investment brings new momentum to crypto\n\nThe regulator is also giving itself at least another 45 days to make a decision on Global X's proposed bitcoin ETF.\n\nThese delays signal the SEC could be planning to use the full amount of time it is allowed to decide on each filing. The regulator is allotted 240 days to consider approving spot bitcoin ETF applications. It is not immediately clear whether the SEC will do the same for competing proposals by BlackRock, Fidelity, WisdomTree and other companies.\n\nBitcoin trading flat\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) has traded flat after the recent postponements. The digital asset is locked in a tight range around the mid-$26,000 mark. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation is currently changing hands for $26,432, a slight rise of 0.2% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe digital asset is still down 60% from its November 2021 all-time high of around $68,000. However, it has fared better than most risk assets so far in 2023. When looking at the year-to-date price chart, bitcoin has gained 60% since January. This is significant considering the digital asset bottomed out at around $16,800 in November 2022, after the calamity of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange collapse.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nMost analysts believe the current price is being supported by investor optimism that an exchange traded fund approval is only a matter of time. But after the recent delays from the SEC, this optimism could be wearing thin.\n\nBlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF\n\nThe highest hopes are held for BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF filing. With most analysts suggesting that the world's largest asset manager would not make such an application without the understanding that its approval is a foregone conclusion.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) filed for their spot bitcoin ETF on June 15. This prompted several other institutions to refile previous applications.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) was detailed as the crypto custodian and spot market data provider for BlackRock's filing. BNY Mellon (BK) was listed as its cash custodian. The filing was a surprise for many after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink had previously said bitcoin was an index for money laundering.\n\nFink now seems bullish about the digital asset. During an interview on CNBC following his company's second-quarter earnings report, Fink stated that \"more and more\" gold investors have been inquiring about the role of cryptocurrency over the last five years. He added that ETF approvals could democratise access to bitcoin in the same way they have done for gold.\n\nOngoing crypto winter\n\nThe optimism that a spot bitcoin ETF could finally be approved cannot disguise significant fault lines showing throughout the crypto-ecosystem. Trading volume across centralised exchanges has slumped, venture capital funding is drying up, and in August volatility in bitcoin markets hit an all-time low.\n\nAlso, according to a recent study, over 95% of NFTs are now worthless. A recent study by dappGambl said that of the 73,257 NFT collections identified, 69,795 of them have a market cap of zero ether (ETH-USD).\n\n\"This statistic effectively means that 95% of people holding NFT collections are currently holding onto worthless investments,\" the analysts said.\n\nWatch: Can web3 emulate the success of the $350 billion traditional gaming market? | The Crypto Mile\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "title": "Bitcoin's inflation-hedge theory tested as rising interest rates bring turbulence to markets - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The United States economy has been facing turbulent times lately, with the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation index rising by a significant 3.5% over the past 12 months. Even when excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, it\u2019s evident that the efforts made by the U.S. Federal Reserve to curb inflation have fallen short of their 2% target rate.\n\nU.S. Treasurys have lost a staggering $1.5 trillion in value, primarily due to these rate hikes. This has led investors to question whether Bitcoin (BTC) and risk-on assets, including the stock market, will succumb to heightened interest rates and a monetary policy aimed at cooling economic growth.\n\nTheoretical losses of U.S. Treasury holders, USD. Source: Joe Consorti\n\nAs the U.S. Treasury keeps flooding the market with debt, there\u2019s a real risk that rates could climb even higher, exacerbating the losses to fixed-income investors. An additional $8 trillion in government debt is expected to mature in the next 12 months, further contributing to financial instability.\n\nAs Daniel Porto, the head of Deaglo London, pointed out in remarks to Reuters:\n\n\u201c(The Fed) are going to play a game where inflation is going to lead, but the real question is can we sustain this course without doing a lot of damage?\u201d\n\nPorto's comments resonate with a growing concern in financial circles \u2014 a fear that the central bank might tighten its policies to the point where it causes severe disruptions to the financial system.\n\nHigh interest rates eventually have devastating consequences\n\nOne of the primary drivers behind the recent turmoil in financial markets is the rise in interest rates. As rates increase, the prices of existing bonds fall, a phenomenon known as interest rate risk or duration. This risk isn\u2019t limited to specific groups \u2014 it affects countries, banks, companies, individuals and anyone holding fixed-income instruments.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Index has experienced a 6.6% drop in September alone. Additionally, the yield on the U.S. 10-year bonds climbed to 4.7% on Sept. 28, marking its highest level since August 2007. This surge in yields demonstrates that investors are becoming increasingly hesitant to take the risk of holding long-term bonds, even those issued by the government itself.\n\nBanks, which typically borrow short-term instruments and lend for the long term, are especially vulnerable in this environment. They rely on deposits and often hold Treasurys as reserve assets.\n\nWhen Treasurys lose value, banks may find themselves short of the necessary funds to meet withdrawal requests. This compels them to sell Treasurys and other assets, pushing them dangerously close to insolvency and requiring rescue by institutions like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or larger banks. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank and Signature Bank serves as a warning of the financial system instability.\n\nFederal Reserve shadow intervention could near exhaustion\n\nWhile emergency mechanisms such as the Federal Reserve's emergency loan Bank Term Funding Program can provide some relief by allowing banks to post impaired Treasurys as collateral, these measures do not make the losses magically disappear.\n\nBanks are increasingly offloading their holdings to private credit and hedge funds, flooding these sectors with rate-sensitive assets. This trend is poised to worsen if the debt ceiling is increased to avoid a government shutdown, further raising yields and amplifying losses in the fixed-income markets.\n\nAs long as interest rates remain high, the risk of financial instability grows, prompting the Federal Reserve to support the financial system using emergency credit lines. That is highly beneficial for scarce assets like Bitcoin, given the increasing inflation and the worsening profile of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as measured by the $1.5 trillion paper losses in U.S Treasurys.\n\nTiming this event is almost impossible, let alone what would happen if larger banks consolidate the financial system or if the Federal Reserve effectively guarantees liquidity for troubled financial institutions. Still, there\u2019s hardly a scenario where one would be pessimistic with Bitcoin under those circumstances.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "In brief A futures contract is an agreement that obligates a trader to buy or sell an asset at a specific time, quantity and price.\n\nBitcoin futures help to bring in additional liquidity to the market and also provide opportunities for arbitrage.\n\nAs the trading value of Bitcoin varies, so too will the value of different Bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCoinbase announced on September 28, 2023 that it plans to launch its regulated perpetual futures contracts on its Coinbase Advanced platform (initially for non-US customers). Why futures? Partly because they offer investors a way of potentially taking advantage of the high volatility of most crypto. Let's use Bitcoin as an example.\n\nSpot trading\u2014the practice of buying and selling Bitcoin\u2014forces traders to exchange cryptocurrencies at their current prices. But what if there was a way to lock in that price of $4,000, picking up the Bitcoin a couple of months later? So even if Bitcoin\u2019s price hit $12,000, the counterparty would have to deliver the Bitcoin purchase with $4,000.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is! It\u2019s called a futures contract. A futures contract is an agreement between two traders that obligates a trader to buy or sell an asset at a specific time, quantity and price. For example, you might enter an agreement in mid-March to buy one Bitcoin for $4,000 for August 30. You could also be on the other side of the deal, agreeing to selling a Bitcoin for a fixed price. If you\u2019re a buyer, you want the trading price of Bitcoin to go up, as you will be able to buy the cryptocurrency at below market value, while sellers want the opposite, profiting if Bitcoin were to decrease in price.\n\nFutures contracts and the evolution of asset classes\n\n\"Futures are an important part of the evolution of asset classes,\" Nick Cowan, CEO of the GSX Group, told Decrypt. \"They provide a benchmark\u2014a Fair Value, or FV\u2014of what the future value is, allowing arbitrage and liquidity to enter the market.\"\n\nDid you know? Futures contracts originated with 17th-century Japanese samurai, who were paid in rice but were out most of the year doing whatever it is that 17th-century samurai do. But they wanted to ensure that the rice they were paid in, say, February held its value until August, so they traded contracts that obliged the signee to pay out the equivalent amount of rice in August, regardless of its current value.\n\nThe reason why you might trade Bitcoin futures as opposed to just, say, buying lots of Bitcoin worth $4,000 at the time, is that you don\u2019t have to hold them yourself. (Our Japanese samurai analogy is helpful here\u2014the Japanese samurai traded futures contracts so they wouldn\u2019t have to store the rice themselves).\n\nSome crypto exchanges, such as OKEx, have lower trading fees for futures contracts, which means that traders can squeeze a bit more out of their accounts by using futures.\n\nHow a trader exits their futures position\n\nNick Cowan, CEO of the GSX Group, told Decrypt: \u201cBTC futures are a great way to bring in additional liquidity to the market and also provide great crypto arbitrage opportunities.\u201d That\u2019s because futures contracts are generally not held until their expiration date. Instead, they are traded like other assets. As the trading value of Bitcoin varies, so too will the value of different Bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nWhen entering a futures contract, there are three ways a trader can exit their position: offsetting, rollovers and expiry. Offsetting is the most common, and occurs when a trader creates another futures contract with an equal value and size, making their effective obligations zero as they balance out. Rolling over is done by offsetting a position, but with an expiry date that is further into the future. Expiry is what you\u2019d expect: it\u2019s when a contract reaches its end date and the parties who hold the contract buy or sell at the agreed price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFutures contracts and hedging\n\nAnother trading method for futures is hedging. Hedging is a way to reduce risk, which is useful for traders dealing with the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\n\nConsider a trader who just bought three Bitcoin at a $10,000 a pop:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 She believes that the price of Bitcoin will rise by the end of the month, but wants to protect her position in case it goes down.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 To protect her position, she can enter a futures contract to sell one Bitcoin for $10,000 at the end of the month.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 At the end of the month, if Bitcoin has gone up, she will make a profit by selling the remaining two Bitcoin.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 If it goes down, she will lose money, but this will be limited as she can still sell one Bitcoin for $10,000.\n\nHedging reduces a trader\u2019s overall risk, although it does also limit their potential profits.\n\nThe pros and cons of Bitcoin futures\n\nFirst things first: Bitcoin futures are\u2014by their very definition\u2014speculative investments. In its decade-plus year history, Bitcoin has proven that the only constant is price volatility, and while the famed cryptocurrency might be on a bull run now, there\u2019s no telling what tomorrow might bring for Bitcoin. If you speculate at the wrong time, you could be left stranded with a future asset that just isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nThere\u2019s also something to be said for being an experienced investor. To successfully utilize futures, an investor needs to understand market behavior, have enough knowledge to pay attention to reasonable market predictions, and enough sense to discard unfounded claims. Ultimately, Bitcoin futures are speculative, but it is possible to leverage good information on a best effort basis. Doing that, however, is not exactly easy, so one might argue that Bitcoin futures are not very accessible for the average person.\n\nThe inverse of this is that Bitcoin futures are a great way of getting ahead of a positive market price. If an investor times it right, there could, at least hypothetically, be major profit to be had by leveraging the Bitcoin Futures market.\n\nBitcoin futures also\u2014counterintuitively\u2014don't involve holding any Bitcoin whatsoever. Instead, it simply involves trading Bitcoin at a future, pre-agreed upon date, whatever the price at that time may be. Understanding the market might not be the most accessible task, but you don\u2019t even need an ounce of technology to get involved, not even a Bitcoin wallet.\n\nCash settlements\n\nBitcoin futures are settled with cash. Because no active Bitcoin trading takes place in a futures market, agreements are satisfied by trading at future, pre-agreed prices. Another oft-cited advantage of the Bitcoin futures market is that the possibility of settling in cash means that no complex software or technological expertise is really necessary in order to get involved in this arena.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMargin trading\n\nOne aspect of Bitcoin futures is margin trading, which essentially means that an investor only requires a percentage of a contract\u2019s total in order to participate.\n\nLeveraging 10-20% of a Bitcoin future means that an investment has both a high potential for profit, but also for a loss.\n\nBitcoin futures: a note of caution\n\nThe world of Bitcoin futures isn\u2019t all fun and games. Taking on a contract is a serious obligation, and if it reaches its expiry date, the trader has a legal obligation to fulfill it.\n\nFutures could lose you a lot of money, as you could be forced to buy Bitcoin way above its current trading price. Cryptocurrencies are one of the most volatile asset classes available; as with all cryptocurrencies, trading Bitcoin is very risky.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "title": "SEC drags on with spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum futures get a nod - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "The SEC gave a big present to crypto ETF firms late last week ahead of the government shutdown that appeared inevitable, reportedly granting approval for a number of ethereum futures strategies that could start trading soon.\n\nFirst on its list appears to be Valkyrie Funds, which had filed with the regulator to add ethereum futures to its existing Bitcoin Strategy ETF. Another firm, VanEck, announced Thursday that it would soon launch its Ethereum Futures ETF, declining to give a precise date. And according to reporting by Reuters, the biggest bitcoin futures ETF shop, ProShares, was also granted approval. That firm similarly announced on its site that its three ETFs featuring ethereum futures would be available soon.\n\nThe development, much as any previous indications that the SEC might be moving forward with approval of crypto-themed funds, led to a mass of additional filings for products. Other firms that essentially got in line for approval by the SEC include Kelly ETFs and Bitwise.\n\nBut the apparent approvals of ethereum futures ETF followed news that likely upset crypto fund proponents, with the SEC indicating a further delay in approving spot bitcoin products. Since Grayscale Investments\u2019 recent court win over the SEC\u2019s denial of its application, there has been mounting pressure on the agency to begin approving spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has been clearing their desks ahead of the possible government shutdown, which means issuing delays for spot bitcoin ETF filings while likely allowing ether future ETFs to potentially begin trading early next week,\u201d Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at VettaFi, said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that these products will be accelerated to launch sooner than later before the government shutdown occurs.\u201d\n\nThat shutdown was temporarily averted on Saturday, with Congress approving a spending bill that will continue to keep the government open for 45 days.\n\nOn Friday, Valkyrie filed an update with the SEC in which it appeared to back away from an immediate launch of an ethereum futures strategy within its bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cEffectively immediately, the fund will not purchase ether futures contracts until the effectiveness of an amendment to the fund\u2019s registration statement contemplating the addition of ether futures contracts to the principal investment strategy of the fund. Until such time, the fund will unwind any existing positions in ether futures contracts,\u201d the company stated.\n\nWhile the approvals are a step forward for crypto ETF providers, it\u2019s only a minor development compared with the eventual launch of spot products, demand for which is expected to quickly eclipse that of crypto futures ETFs.\n\nAlthough there has been significant interest in the biggest bitcoin futures ETF, the $952 million ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, advisors who want crypto funds are waiting for spot products, said Tyrone Ross, CEO and co-founder of Turnqey Labs.\n\n\u201cFinancial advisors have no interest in futures ETFs. Most advisors want a spot bitcoin or spot ethereum ETF,\u201d Ross said. \u201cAs far as advisors go, it\u2019s a miss.\u201d\n\nThere could be demand among retail investors and hedge funds, but the complicated nature of futures products, on top of the crypto asset class that many people do not understand, make them a tough sell to advisors, he said.\n\n\u201cCrypto is hard enough. But now I have to explain a crypto futures product?\u201d Ross said, adding that the fees for the products can also be discouraging. \u201cFrom a compliance standpoint, it\u2019s going to be hard to get a futures product [approved].\u201d\n\nRoss is not a fan of ETFs for crypto in any form, but said that the \u201cbroader wealth management space is a little giddy\u201d as the ethereum futures ETF approvals \u201cmeans more pressure is being put on [SEC Chair] Gary Gensler and that we are closer to approval of a spot ETF.\u201d\n\nGiven that anyone who wants to hold ethereum can do so through a U.S. exchange, the futures ETFs approval \u201cis kind of a nothingburger,\u201d said Mike Alfred, whose hedge fund Alpine Fox focuses on bitcoin and bitcoin-related equities.\n\n\u201cIt may be bullish for ethereum traders in the short term,\u201d as the approvals mean another avenue of quasi access to it, he said.\n\nSpot products will offer lower fees compared with those of futures products, Alfred said.\n\n\u201cThe real embedded cost of owning a futures product is a lot higher,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the risk of underperforming the actual asset is high.\u201d\n\nFor example, while the price of bitcoin has increased by 62% so far this year, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF has returned less than 32%.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think an ethereum futures [ETF] approval is much of a watershed moment,\u201d Alfred said. \u201cIf anything, it shows how backwards-thinking the SEC is on this.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated to reflect the temporary spending bill passed on Saturday by Congress."

        "title": "Want to Buy a Bitcoin Mining Stock? Read This Before You Invest. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -1.43%) mining companies are some of the best-performing stocks of the year. Top Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT -6.39%) is up a dizzying 172% year to date. Marathon Digital Holdings has gained 153%. And shares of eco-friendly Bitcoin miner CleanSpark is up by a head-turning 92%. So it's no surprise that investors are scooping up these mining stocks as a way to pump up their portfolio returns.\n\nBut there might be a better way to get access to the Bitcoin mining sector, and that's through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). The one ETF that I have in mind is the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI -6.83%). This specialized fund invests 80% of its net assets in companies that derive at least one-half of their revenue or profits from Bitcoin mining, or that provide specialized chips, hardware, software, and services to Bitcoin mining companies.\n\nDiversification benefits\n\nInstead of trying to choose a winner in the hyper-competitive Bitcoin mining sector, it could make sense to invest in an ETF that covers the broader Bitcoin mining market. That way, you get access to a wide range of Bitcoin miners without being overexposed to any particular stock. Moreover, you can gain access to the companies that are selling the \"picks and shovels\" to the Bitcoin miners without having to invest in them directly.\n\nAs of Sept. 22, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF held stakes in 21 companies. The largest holdings include several pure-play Bitcoin mining stocks: Riot Platforms (10.6%), CleanSpark (10.2%), and Marathon Digital Holdings (9.8%). In addition, the ETF holds smaller stakes in several other Bitcoin mining stocks, including Hut 8 Mining (4.7%), HIVE Technologies (4.8%), and Terawulf (5%). Thus, approximately one-half of the ETF's holdings are in the largest Bitcoin mining stocks.\n\nBut what's most interesting is what else the fund holds. For example, it holds a 10.5% position in Iris Energy, which builds, owns, and operates data centers and infrastructure for the mining of Bitcoin. And it holds a 9.4% stake in Cipher Mining, a company dedicated to expanding and strengthening Bitcoin's critical infrastructure in the U.S. The fund also holds much smaller positions in top tech names such as Nvidia (4.8%), AMD (1.2%), Samsung (1.2%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (1.2%).\n\nPotential trade-offs\n\nThe trade-off for diversification, though, is returns well below the hottest single stocks. While the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF is now the top-performing ETF through the first nine months of the year, its performance doesn't come anywhere close to that of star performer Riot Platforms. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF is up 110% for the year, but Riot is up by 172%. Thus, you are definitely sacrificing some return on your investment in exchange for all of the diversification benefits you are getting.\n\nIn addition, it needs to be pointed out that with an ETF, you are paying a management fee for the portfolio rebalancing that needs to occur on a regular basis. Currently, the expense ratio for the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF is 0.75%, which is generally considered to be a good ETF expense ratio. However, every dollar paid out in management fees is a dollar whose value is not compounded over the long haul.\n\nFrom my perspective, though, the trade-off between diversification and returns is one worth taking. For one, it makes my job as an investor much easier. Instead of having to compare each Bitcoin mining stock against the other in order to find the \"winner,\" I can simply buy one fund and let it do all the heavy lifting. All I have to do is find a fund that invests in several of the top Bitcoin mining stocks.\n\nMoreover, the broad diversification of an ETF that holds 20 different companies means that I am much more protected from the downside of a crypto bear market. In 2022, for example, Bitcoin lost 65% of its value and Bitcoin mining stocks went along for the ride. So you definitely want some downside protection in order to smooth out your annual returns. Because the ETF holds tech companies that are only tangentially related to Bitcoin mining, you are basically getting insurance that you won't lose as much as if you were holding just a single Bitcoin mining stock.\n\nDiversification reduces risk\n\nIf you are new to crypto investing, diversification could be a great way to reduce your risk. By holding a basket of Bitcoin miners, instead of just the \"best\" Bitcoin miner, you get access to more diversification as well as protection against a crypto downturn. You lose some upside, but you're not forced into picking a winner.\n\nSo the next time you are thinking about investing in a Bitcoin mining stock, consider the alternatives. If you are risk-averse, new to crypto, or unwilling to manage your portfolio actively, a fund like the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF could be a great option."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nGet ready: Roughly $3 billion in Bitcoin options contracts will expire later today. But what does that mean for the price of the biggest cryptocurrency?\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was up 0.2% in the past 24 hours\u2014trading hands for $26,921, according to CoinGecko. The asset has brought the rest of the market with it, with most digital coins and tokens in the green.\n\nBut with Bitcoin options contracts set to expire, the price of cryptocurrency could dip or swing up even higher, right?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot necessarily. According to experts who spoke to Decrypt, it\u2019s unlikely the price of Bitcoin will budge that much.\n\nData from CME Group shows that $9 billion worth of open interest\u2014or unexpired options contracts. And of those, $3 billion will expire today.\n\nA Bitcoin options contract is a deal that lets buyers snap up Bitcoin at an agreed-upon price\u2014regardless of whether the price changes by the time the contract expires, which can be many months later.\n\nThis means traders don\u2019t have to buy the Bitcoin when the contract expires\u2014they just can if they want to.\n\nThis means that if all that Bitcoin isn\u2019t bought by Friday, it will be either held or dumped. This would lead one to believe that it could cause price volatility.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t usually happen. Anders Helseth, head of research at K33, told Decrypt that \u201cin general, options expiries in crypto don\u2019t affect prices much.\u201d\n\nWhile CryptoQuant contributing analyst BaroVirtual added that the current data \u201cindicates no clear bullish or bearish sentiment.\u201d\n\nHe added that it \u201cwas likely\u201d Bitcoin would continue to trade between $26,500 and $27,250 in October.\n\n\u201cThe tiny options volume by expiration also confirms the thesis that Bitcoin will probably not expect large-scale price spikes in the coming days,\u201d he noted.\n\nAlthough the price of Bitcoin has historically been volatile, that looks like it is changing. And it doesn\u2019t look like $3 billion in options contracts will make much of a difference, either."

        "title": "The Lightning Network Makes Bitcoin Unstoppable: Bitcoin Backstage with David Marcus - Nasdaq",
        "content": "One of the biggest challenges Bitcoin faces is scalability. Transactions can be slow and costly, making mainchain settlement less efficient for everyday transactional use. Enter the Lightning Network, an innovative solution that has the potential to make Bitcoin unstoppable. In the latest episode of Bitcoin Backstage, we explore the concept behind the Lightning Network, its role in Bitcoin's growth, the involvement of David Marcus with LightSpark, and the unstoppable nature of Bitcoin itself.\n\nUnderstanding the Lightning Network\n\nBefore we delve into the incredible impact the Lightning Network has had on Bitcoin, it is essential to understand how it works. The Lightning Network is a second-layer, off-chain scaling solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It addresses the scalability issue by enabling faster and cheaper transactions. The Lightning Network has revolutionized the way Bitcoin transactions are conducted.\n\nThe Concept Behind the Lightning Network\n\nThe Lightning Network operates by creating payment channels between two parties, allowing them to transact without broadcasting every transaction to the blockchain. These channels are then connected to form a vast network, enabling payments to be routed through multiple nodes securely and efficiently.\n\nHow the Lightning Network Enhances Bitcoin\n\nThe Lightning Network enhances Bitcoin by significantly reducing transaction fees and speeding up settlment times. With the Lightning Network, users can make near-instantaneous transactions, making it ideal for micropayments and everyday transactions. This scalability solution opens up new possibilities for Bitcoin to be used as a medium of exchange, similar to traditional currencies.\n\nBefore the Lightning Network, Bitcoin faced challenges in terms of scalability. As the number of users increased, the Bitcoin blockchain became congested, resulting in high transaction fees and slower confirmation times. This made it impractical for small-value transactions and hindered Bitcoin's potential as a widely accepted form of payment.\n\nHowever, with the Lightning Network, these limitations are overcome. By conducting transactions off-chain, the Lightning Network relieves the majority of the burden on the main blockchain, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. This scalability solution has made Bitcoin more accessible and practical for everyday use.\n\nThe Lightning Network has also sparked innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Developers are now creating applications and services that leverage the Lightning Network's capabilities, such as instant payment processors, decentralized exchanges, and microtransaction platforms. These developments are expanding the use cases of Bitcoin and driving its adoption.\n\nThe Lightning Network has revolutionized the Bitcoin landscape by providing a scalable and efficient solution for transactions. Its concept of payment channels and off-chain transactions has opened up new possibilities for Bitcoin to be used as a medium of exchange. As the Lightning Network continues to evolve, we can expect even more exciting developments in the world of Bitcoin.\n\nDavid Marcus: A Key Player in Bitcoin's Evolution\n\nLet's take a closer look at David Marcus's role in the Bitcoin ecosystem and his vision for its future.\n\nMarcus's Vision for the Future of Bitcoin\n\nAs a prominent figure in the financial technology world and the Co-Founder and CEO of LightSpark, David Marcus has been vocal about his optimism for Bitcoin and its underlying technology. He believes that the Lightning Network has the potential to unlock new possibilities for Bitcoin, making it more accessible and efficient for global transactions. Marcus envisions a future where Bitcoin becomes a mainstream medium of exchange, providing financial inclusion to the unbanked and revolutionizing cross-border payments.\n\nThe Unstoppable Nature of Bitcoin\n\nFactors Making Bitcoin Unstoppable\n\nBitcoin's decentralized nature, robust blockchain technology, and scarce supply all contribute to its resilience and immutability. These factors make it highly resistant to censorship and external control, making it a truly people-centric currency.\n\nThe Role of the Lightning Network in Bitcoin's Unstoppability\n\nThe Lightning Network strengthens Bitcoin's unstoppable nature by introducing a layer of trustless, decentralized payment channels. By utilizing these channels, Bitcoin transactions occur off-chain, making them less susceptible to network congestion, censorship, and high fees. The Lightning Network ensures that Bitcoin retains its unstoppable nature on a global scale.\n\nLooking Ahead: The Future of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network\n\nThe Lightning Network's Potential Impact on Cryptocurrency\n\nThe Lightning Network sets a precedent for scalability solutions on Bitcoin. Its success demonstrates the feasibility of off-chain payment channels, inspiring innovation and development within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nThe Lightning Network has emerged as a game-changer for Bitcoin, addressing its scalability challenges and propelling it towards mainstream adoption. With its potential to make transactions faster, cheaper, and more efficient, the Lightning Network is instrumental in making Bitcoin unstoppable. Combined with visionaries like David Marcus, Bitcoin's future looks bright, with the unstoppable nature of this revolutionary cryptocurrency set to transform the way we transact and interact with money.\n\nNews Recap of the Week (9/22/2023)\n\nAnti CBDC Bill\n\nThe First Anti-CBDC [Central Bank Digital Currency] Bill in the USA was passed out of the Financial Services Committee. The Bill was brought up by whip Tom Emmer. This bill prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC directly or indirectly to individuals or maintaining accounts on behalf of individuals. This is to thwart the ever expanding digital surveillance state that has been plaguing the world.\n\nFree Julian Assange\n\nThis week a cross-party delegation of Australian Politicians met with US officials, members of congress, and civil rights groups to urge the US government to abandon efforts to prosecute Wikileaks' Founder Julian Assange who is being accused of leaking classified US military documents. He is facing up to 175 in an American high security prison. What happened to freedom of press?\n\nNigeria is Bullish on Bitcoin\n\nCryptocurrency usage is growing as the country of Nigeria grapples with a weakening currency and soaring inflation. Nigeria\u2019s volume of crypto transitions has grown 9% year-over-year to over 56.7 billion dollars between July 2022 and July 2023.\n\nEurope tightens its grip on Crypto\n\nEurope plans to tighten its grip on crypto in 2026. European Union's eighth version of the directive on administrative cooperation or the DAC8 law will come into full force. This law is designed to help EU tax authorities track digital asset transactions and any efforts made trying to reduce potential tax fraud and evasion.\n\nStanford University returns money\n\nStanford University will return the $5.5M in donations from Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX. This donation was done directly by Joe Bankman, Sam\u2019s father and a long time faculty member at Stanford. The same man who was unhappy with his compensation at FTX, triggering an email to SBF asking for more money, pulling the \u2018I am telling your mother\u2019 while CC\u2019d Sam\u2019s mom Barbara.\n\nUS hits new milestone\n\nThe US has officially hit a new milestone of gross national debt just passed $33 Trillion dollars meaning it has spiked $1.58 Trillion since the debt ceiling was lifted in June.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "REDMOND, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Metagood launches Osura.com, the premier marketplace curated for high-end Bitcoin Ordinal collections.\n\nSince early 2023, Ordinals saw a meteoric rise, with over 33 million inscriptions as of earlier this month. Ordinals are quite different and offer many benefits compared to NFTs stored on Ethereum. NFTs on Ethereum are designed around digital certificates, or pointers to data and images stored off-chain on services like AWS (Amazon Web Services) or IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). In contrast, Bitcoin NFTs are designed as digital artifacts that are immutable, uncensorable, self-sovereign, permissionless, and stored fully on-chain (all data lives on Bitcoin).\n\nThese properties have led to a community of early adopters who believe Bitcoin is now the natural home for high-end NFTs. With the NFT market showing impressive adoption for both Ethereum and Solana during the last crypto bull run, the Osura team believes Ordinals on Bitcoin will see rapid adoption over the next year.\n\nWhen obtaining digital assets, users need to trust that they get the highest quality product when transacting. Osura is a destination for true digital art connoisseurs. It offers collectors a curated marketplace and enables them to collect, buy and sell digital artifacts. With a strategy to curate only the highest-quality digital assets, Osura debuts with two exceptional Bitcoin Ordinals NFT collections: OnChainMonkey (OCM) Dimensions 300 and the Asprey Bugatti Egg Collection by Asprey Studio, Bugatti, and Metagood. Both collections are 3D, interactive, and use recursion. Metagood co-founder Danny Yang developed new technology to create 3D animated and interactive art for the OCM Dimensions collection on Bitcoin.\n\nOCM Dimensions 300 is arguably the most innovative art collection on Bitcoin. Inscribed in February 2023, OCM Dimensions stands out among Bitcoin collections. It is a high-resolution, 3D art collection that pioneered recursion, one of the most significant aspects of Bitcoin Ordinals. The animated art scales with display size, presenting pixel-perfect clarity even on 8K screens. Remarkably, this quality is achieved with a file size of less than 1 kilobyte per inscription. These are some of the many things Dimensions achieved that were thought impossible on Bitcoin.\n\nFollowing the OCM Dimensions 300 innovation is the Asprey Bugatti Egg Collection. The Asprey Bugatti Egg is a cutting-edge 3D digital artifact. Working with Asprey Studio, Metagood crafted the generative code to encapsulate the essence of nature\u2019s perfection. Only 111 in the whole collection, all eggs have a different motion of lighting that is unique to each of them. This exclusive collection is inscribed on uncommon satoshis (sats), with one of these sats being the oldest inscribed uncommon sat to date.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bI\u2019ve spent the last decade building on Bitcoin and the last few years focusing on creating high-end digital artifacts on Ethereum and now on Bitcoin. Now is a truly exciting time in NFTs - the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol just launched a few months ago. With our background creating digital artifacts, we understood the significance immediately and focused on Bitcoin Ordinals early on,\u201d Danny Yang, co-founder and CEO of Metagood, said.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the largest, most decentralized, and secure blockchain, and now Ordinals will see the most significant and high-end NFTs being stored on Bitcoin, too. At Osura, our focus is to foster and shepherd this new market and curate the best works in a trusted manner,\u201d Amanda Terry, co-founder and COO of Metagood, said.\n\n\"Metagood played an instrumental role in delivering the technical backing for our Asprey Bugatti Egg Collection,\" Ali Walker, Chief Creative Officer at Asprey Studio, said. \"Their deep expertise and knowledge of Bitcoin technology set them at the forefront of putting digital assets on chain. The Osura marketplace will set a new standard for luxury Bitcoin NFT collections.\u201d\n\nWhat sets the Osura marketplace apart is the curated art, the cutting-edge technology, the experienced and reputable team, and the seamless and secure product.\n\nAs a trusted pioneering authority in shaping the future of digital assets, Metagood built Osura to continue to launch collections for renowned brands and esteemed creators. The Osura team also plans to put together an Osura Curation Board for Digital Artifacts (with names to be announced shortly) as a new asset class that includes creators, collectors, historians, and technologists.\n\nOCM Dimensions and the Asprey Bugatti Egg Collection NFTs will be displayed in Asprey Studio\u2019s Mayfair Gallery during their London Frieze event \u201cDigital Muses\u201d on October 10. Metagood COO Amanda Terry will speak at \u201cThe Art of Ordinals\u201d Asprey Studio event in Paris on October 11, where the NFTs will also be displayed.\n\nAbout Osura\n\nOsura Bitcoin NFT Marketplace will host only the highest quality high-end digital assets. The team behind Osura, Metagood, has been building on the Bitcoin blockchain for over a decade. Their expertise allowed them to develop pioneering technology such as recursion, parent-child collection provenance, and launch the first on-chain randomization and reveal for an NFT collection on Bitcoin.\n\nMetagood proved its tech expertise by inscribing the first 10,000 image art collection of NFTs in one transaction on Ethereum in 2021 and on Bitcoin in 2023. It also launched the first 3D art collection fully on-chain on Bitcoin in June 2023. Osura enables renowned brands and creators to inscribe their high-end digital art on the Bitcoin blockchain. The platform caters to both seasoned and budding collectors, ensuring they discover unique and valuable Bitcoin NFT art of the highest quality.\n\nAbout OnChainMonkey\n\nOnChainMonkey, by Metagood, is a pioneering digital art collection. It is the first 10,000-image art collection created on-chain in a single transaction on Ethereum in 2021. In 2023, OnChainMonkey made history again, becoming the first 10,000-image collection inscribed on Bitcoin, and all done in a single inscription (#20219).\n\nThe collection is led by an experienced team: Danny Yang, who founded Taiwan\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Maicoin; Amanda Terry, who served as a digital media business development executive at Twitter and NBC; and Bill Tai, a legendary VC and the first investor in Zoom and early investor in Canva, Dapper Labs and over 20 companies that have become publicly listed. The OnChainMonkey community is building businesses in Web3 and making real-world impact.\n\nAbout Metagood\n\nMetagood is a leader in blockchain technology and digital assets, setting a new standard for innovation in the crypto industry that blends technology, art, and community. Metagood was recognized in Fast Company\u2019s 2022 Best World Changing Ideas Awards for Impact Investing.\n\nMetagood strives to build a better future for Web3. Through its innovative NFT collection OnChainMonkey (OCM), Metagood has created value and contributed to important causes, such as funding the successful evacuation of Sharbat Gula (known as \u201cAfghan Girl\u201d from the iconic 1984 National Geographic cover) and her family from Afghanistan, donating to humanitarian aid in Ukraine, Coral Reef conservation, and more.\n\nMetagood was founded by veterans with decades of business experience. Its chairman, Bill Tai, a legendary venture capitalist, has been at the forefront of the crypto space since 2010. Danny Yang, the CEO, founded both Maicoin, Taiwan's largest cryptocurrency exchange, and Blockseer, a blockchain technology company providing services to customers like the FBI, US Secret Service, and the DHS. He also founded the Stanford Bitcoin Meetup in 2013. Amanda Terry, the COO, is a former business development executive at Twitter, NBC, and the co-founder and managing partner of ACTAI Ventures.\n\nAbout Asprey Studio (aspreystudio.com)\n\nAsprey Studio was founded in 2022, part of the 242-year-old luxury house, Asprey. Asprey Studio creates unique artworks that make use of innovative and groundbreaking production techniques. The Asprey Studio Gallery is a multi-purpose gallery space that will host exhibitions and showcase Asprey Studio creations. Located on the second floor of the Asprey London flagship store in Mayfair, the Gallery\u2019s primary focus will be on creating a new way to exhibit, release, and purchase artworks.\n\nIn a recent pioneering collaboration with Bugatti, the Studio designed one hundred and eleven precious metal eggs linked to generative art in Bitcoin. The release showcases not only the art of coding but also creates a new form of art expression that bridges physical and digital creations."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm Marathon Digital has confirmed it mined an invalid Bitcoin block during an \u201cexperiment\u201d aimed at optimizing the firm\u2019s operations.\n\nIn a Sept. 27 X post, Marathon said it utilizes a small percentage of the firm\u2019s hash rate toward these experiments and stressed they weren\u2019t trying to alter the network in any way.\n\n\u201cIn no way was this experiment an attempt to alter Bitcoin Core in any way,\u201d Marathon said, emphasizing that they corrected the error as soon as they noticed the invalid block.\n\nWe can confirm that Marathon did mine an invalid block. We utilize a small portion of our hash rate to experiment with our development pool and research potential methods to optimize our operations. The error was the result of an unanticipated bug that came from one of our\u2026 \u2014 Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) (@MarathonDH) September 27, 2023\n\nMarathon said the bug, which emanated from the firm\u2019s internal development environment, wasn\u2019t related to Marathon\u2019s Bitcoin production pool or Bitcoin Core, the leading software used to connect to the Bitcoin network and run a node.\n\nThe incident occurred on Sept. 26 at 9:42 pm UTC on block 809,478, according to Mempool.space.\n\nSeveral Bitcoin developers, along with BitMEX Research, attributed the invalid block to a \u201ctransaction ordering issue.\u201d Bitcoin developer \u201cmononaut\u201d believes Marathon mistake came from re-sorting the transactions in order of ascending absolute fees.\n\nThis is what MARA's invalid block at 809478 looks like:\n\n\n\n- pink transactions no longer exist in the main chain\n\n- blue transactions are invalid due to ordering (they spend an output from a transaction included later in the block) https://t.co/SJI1azOB5Z pic.twitter.com/5gY9TRA2eG \u2014 mononaut (@mononautical) September 27, 2023\n\nBitcoin analyst Dylan LeClair suggested that Marathon should have conducted this experiment on a testnet before attempting it on Bitcoin\u2019s mainnet.\n\nIn reflection, Marathon said Bitcoin \u201cfunctioned exactly as designed\u201d by excluding the invalid block:\n\n\u201cThis incident, while unintended, underscores the robust security of the Bitcoin network, which rejected and rectified the anomaly.\u201d\n\nRelated: Marathon Digital Q2 results miss revenue and earnings forecasts\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Marathon for comment but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nMarathon\u2019s (MARA) share price fell 2.91% to $8.01 during opening hours on Sept. 27, according to Google Finance.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Elegant and ass-backward\u2019: Jameson Lopp\u2019s first impression of Bitcoin"

        "title": "Costo sells out of gold bars, but is it a better investment than Bitcoin? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Costco has made headlines this week after it rapidly sold out of gold bars. In times of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, it's no surprise that investors are turning to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. The question is whether gold\u2019s performance will eventually catapult its price above $2,050, a level last seen in early May.\n\nIn the past 12 months, the price of gold has surged by an impressive 12%. This rally has been partially fueled by the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to combat inflation by maintaining higher interest rates, a move that benefits scarce assets like gold. While gold\u2019s performance is commendable, it\u2019s essential to put it into perspective.\n\nGold (yellow) vs. Bitcoin (orange), S&P 500 (green) and WTI oil (black), last 12 months. Source: TradingView\n\nOver the same period, gold\u2019s returns have roughly matched those of the S&P 500, which saw a gain of 15.4%, and WTI oil, which increased by 12%. However, these gains pale in comparison to Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) staggering 39.5% rise. Still, it\u2019s important to note that gold\u2019s lower volatility at 12% makes it an attractive choice for investors looking to manage risk.\n\nRisk-reward scenarios favor gold\n\nOne of gold\u2019s strongest selling points is its reliability as a store of value during times of crisis and uncertainty. Gold\u2019s status as the world\u2019s largest tradable asset, valued at over $12 trillion, positions it as the primary candidate to benefit from capital inflows whenever investors exit traditional markets like stocks and real estate.\n\nGold (yellow) vs. Bitcoin (orange), S&P 500 (green) and WTI oil (black), Feb/Mar 2020. Source: TradingView\n\nFor example, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, gold only dipped by 2.2% in the 30 days leading up to March 24, 2020.\n\nAccording to data from the World Gold Council, central banks have been net buyers of gold for the second consecutive month, adding 55 tons to their reserves, with notable purchases by China, Poland and Turkey.\n\nBloomberg reported that Russia plans to bolster its gold reserves by an additional $433 million to shield its economy from the volatility of commodity markets, especially in the oil and gas industries.\n\n200 years of gold production. Source: Visual Capitalist\n\nTaking a closer look at production figures, Visual Capitalist estimates that approximately 3,100 tonnes of gold were produced in 2022, with Russia and China accounting for 650 tonnes of this total. The World Gold Council also predicted that if gold prices continue to rise, total production could reach a record high of 3,300 tonnes in 2023.\n\nOne crucial metric to consider when evaluating gold\u2019s investment potential is its stock-to-flow ratio, which measures the production of a commodity relative to the total quantity in existence.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price holds steady as S&P 500 plunges to 110-day low\n\nGold\u2019s stock-to-flow has remained stable at around 67 for the past 12 years. In contrast, Bitcoin has experienced three scheduled halvings, effectively reducing its issuance, and currently boasts a stock-to-flow ratio of 59. This suggests that Bitcoin has a lower equivalent inflation rate compared to the precious metal.\n\nBitcoin can outperform gold even with lower inflows\n\nBitcoin\u2019s performance could surpass gold\u2019s as the U.S. government approaches a shutdown due to reaching the debt limit, causing investors to seek alternative scarce assets. Bitcoin\u2019s $500 billion market capitalization makes it easier for the price to jump even if its inflow is much smaller. Additionally, central banks could be compelled to sell their gold holdings to cover expenses, further boosting Bitcoin\u2019s appeal.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility of new gold discoveries. While gold remains a stalwart in the world of safe-haven assets, Bitcoin\u2019s impressive gains and lower equivalent inflation rate make it a strong contender for investors seeking alternative stores of value. Despite this, the ongoing economic uncertainty and the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policies will continue to benefit both assets.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "The US Dollar Index is presently at its highest point since November 2022.\n\nDXY rising has been a bearish signal for SPX and Bitcoin price in the past two years.\n\nBTC has been standing strong and sharing a negative correlation with the S&P 500 Index might prevent a decline.\n\nBitcoin price has always been affected by macroeconomic developments along with other major indices such as the S&P 500 Index, NASDAQ 100, and even Gold. However, this time around, the situation might differ slightly as, unlike the rest of the investment options, the cryptocurrency has held its own.\n\nBitcoin price avoids a steep fall\n\nThe US Dollar Index is known to impact Bitcoin price along with the stock market and precious metals\u2019 value. Since 2021, the rise in the DXY has resulted in a drawdown in the SPX, Gold and BTC. Following this pattern, the S&P 500 index, along with Gold, noted a decline in their market value over the past couple of days.\n\nBitcoin price was expected to do the same, however, the cryptocurrency managed to surprise the market as it has stood firm above $26,000. The DXY hitting a ten-month high of 106.65 seems to bear no impact on BTC. What this means for the world\u2019s largest crypto asset is that a rally might not be too far away.\n\nUS Dollar Index 1-day chart\n\nThe DXY is presently overheated, as noted on the Relative Strength Index, sitting in the overbought zone above 70.0 and is probably looking at some correction or sideways movement until the market cools off.\n\nThis would be just the opportunity needed by Bitcoin price to make a move. The development, according to market analysis platform Santiment, suggests that a breakout might be in store as BTC has managed to stay afloat above $26,000.\n\nWhat moves to expect from BTC price\n\nThe optimism in the crypto market is building up as investors are looking for Bitcoin price to recover and post new year-to-date highs. Trading at $26,317, BTC would need a minor push to flip its 50- and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) into a support line. This is crucial in bringing about a recovery in the value of the digital asset.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart\n\nThe reason why it has managed not to fall considerably akin to SPX while the US Dollar Index rallied is that it shares a negative correlation of -0.2 at the moment. This has kept the digital asset safe from noting a drop in value over the past few weeks.\n\nBitcoin correlation with SPX\n\nThe next major target for Bitcoin price now stands at $30,000 and is likely to reach there provided no sudden bearish development in the crypto market occurs. However, in the event that a decline does take place, it would be crucial for BTC not to fall through the support line at $24,986. This would invalidate the bullish thesis and potentially send the cryptocurrency towards $21,468.\n\nRead more - This short-term Bitcoin holder indicator forecasts another rally for BTC"

        "title": "Bitcoin, XRP Price Receive Boost Following This Coinbase Announcement - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Bitcoin and XRP price are showing some green on low-timeframes as certain narratives around the crypto space gain momentum. The cryptocurrencies stayed about two critical levels and could be poised to extend the trend in the coming days.\n\nAs of this writing, the XRP price trades at $0.50 with a 1% profit in the last 24 hours. In the meantime, Bitcoin recorded a 2.4% profit over a similar period, but the number one cryptocurrency by market cap could underperform XRP and other altcoins.\n\nCoinbase To Launch Crypto Futures Trading Worldwide\n\nCrypto exchange Coinbase recently announced the launch of a derivatives platform for its international clients. The US company has been trying to increase its presence overseas as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tightens regulatory conditions in the country.\n\nIn that sense, the crypto trading venue launched an international arm to grow revenue as spot trading volumes decline with the crypto market. Today, the exchange is confirmed to have secured a license with the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) to allow institutions to trade perpetual futures outside the US.\n\nThe company said in an official statement:\n\nToday, we are excited to announce that Coinbase International Exchange has received additional regulatory approval from the BMA to extend perpetual futures trading to non-US retail customers. In the coming weeks, we will begin to offer eligible customers access to regulated perpetual futures contracts on Coinbase Advanced.\n\nThis announcement could onboard more traders to the crypto ecosystem to benefit Bitcoin, the XRP price, and the entire market. XRP has been among the most popular coins in the past few months following a critical legal victory in the US.\n\nXRP Price Ready For A Surprise Soon?\n\nWhile the legal scenario in the US is still uncertain for the nascent sector, analyst Brett Hill believes that XRP is one of the coins that will benefit due to its victory against the SEC. The analyst claims that the \u201cFar West,\u201d the era where everything was allowed, is \u201cvirtually over\u201d for the nascent industry.\n\nIf this scenario plays out, tokens with legal support will thrive, and XRP and Bitcoin seem the two likely winners in this new era. Just yesterday, SEC Chair Gensler reiterated that Bitcoin is not a security, according to US law, and a court did the same for XRP.\n\nIn that sense, the analyst says that the XRP could \u201ctake you all by surprise\u201d in the coming 48 hours while adding:\n\nThe golden age of cryptocurrency in the far west is virtually over; coming forward, everything will be regulated by white hats.\n\nCover image from Unsplash, Chart from Tradingview\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Q4 Crypto Market Outlook: Bitcoin and Ethereum Consolidation Continues - City Index UK",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Takeaways\n\nGlobal interest rates are finally reaching their peak, presenting a more favorable backdrop for cryptoassets in Q4 and beyond.\n\nMarket internals show the market is poised for a new bullish cycle if a catalyst emerges.\n\nBitcoin remains relatively strong vs. Ethereum, but both are generally consolidating within their mid-year ranges.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Fundamental Analysis\n\n\u201cThe opposite of love isn\u2019t hate; it\u2019s indifference.\u201d \u2013 Elie Wiesel\n\nDespite a dramatically fluctuatuating macroeconomic outlook, the highest interest rates seen in decades, and a complicated regulatory backdrop, Bitcoin and Ethereum have spent the last 6+ months consolidating within a few thousand points on either side of the $28K level. More to the point, all speculative interest in the entire cryptoasset space has been gobbled up by the latest investment theme du jour, Artificial Intelligence.\n\nIn other words, traders have gone from loving Bitcoin and Ethereum two years ago, to hating them at this time last year, to being completely indifferent to them today.\n\nUnder the surface though, there are signs that the cryptoasset space may be ever so gradually entering a new bullish cycle. From a monetary policy perspective, global central banks appear to be approaching their peak interest rates, barring a surprise resurgence of inflation, with fewer and fewer central banks raising interest rates each month:\n\nSource: Alphacast\n\nEven if the Fed or Bank of England is able to squeeze in another rate hike this quarter, it would likely be a \u201cone and done\u201d scenario before a longer period of either holding interest rates steady or outright cutting them if economic growth stumbles.\n\nKeying in on crypto market internals, the proportion of Bitcoin\u2019s supply that is held by long-term holders (>155 days) is approaching record highs above 75%. In contrast to short-term traders who try to capture quick moves, these investors tend to be \u201ctrue believers\u201d who rarely ever sell their coins, suggesting that the true supply of Bitcoin available to buy and sell may be lower than it has been in nearly a decade:\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nLike a pile of dry kindling, this situation sets the stage for a potential \u201csupply shock\u201d if there is a catalyst that leads to an increase in Bitcoin demand. Meanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cdominance,\u201d or Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization relative to the total market cap of all cryptoassets, continues to trend higher above 50%. Traders will be watching for this ratio to roll over to signal increasing speculative appetite in the crypto market and the next bull market to start in earnest:\n\nSource: TradingView, StoneX\n\nBitcoin Technical Analysis \u2013 BTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nSource: TradingView, StoneX\n\nTurning our attention to Bitcoin itself, prices remain within the broad $25K-32K range as we go to press. Looking ahead, the first zone of support to watch will be from $25,000-25,500, which has put a floor under prices multiple times already this year; a break below this zone exposes the Fibonacci retracements at $23,700 and $21,700 next. To the topside, there\u2019s little in the way of resistance until the top of the 6-month range in the $31,000-32,000 area, and on the off chance that resistance zone is overcome this year, the next level to watch will be closer to $36,000, the 38.2% retracement of the 2021-2022 drop.\n\nEthereum Technical Analysis \u2013 ETH/USD Daily Chart\n\nSource: TradingView, StoneX\n\nLooking at Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptoasset has trailed Bitcoin of late. Ether is arguably in a bearish channel since peaking for the year in early April, with prices failing to exceed $2,000 since then (though bulls are putting up a fight to defend support in the $1,500-1,550 area as of writing at the end of September. Looking ahead, a break below $1,500 support would leave little in the way of nearby support until the Q4 2022 lows around $1,150. In terms of levels to watch on the topside, a recovery back to $2,000 would certainly satisfy many bulls after starting the year below $1,200, and a move much beyond that may be too much to ask in the current environment.\n\n-- Written by Matt Weller, Global Head of Research\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter: @MWellerFX"

        "content": "The state\u2019s meteoric rise was propelled by affordable energy prices and a welcoming regulatory environment.\n\nIt further gained momentum after China\u2019s crackdown on crypto mining activities in 2021.\n\nTexas has solidified its position as a dominant force in the world of Bitcoin [BTC] mining, accounting for more than 28% of all Bitcoin hash rate in the United States, according to recent data from crypto mining service provider Foundry USA.\n\nThe state\u2019s meteoric rise as a crypto mining hub is attributed to favorable factors such as affordable energy prices and a welcoming regulatory environment.\n\nIn Foundry\u2019s updated Hashrate Map, Texas emerged as the undisputed leader in Bitcoin hash rate. The state boasts 28.5% of the country\u2019s total rate accounted for. This places Texas far ahead of its closest competitors, with Georgia claiming 9.64% of the hash rate.\n\nNew York claims 8.75%, and New Hampshire contributes 5.33% of the total. Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate signifies the speed at which mining machines work to calculate valid block hashes.\n\nA glimpse back to December 2021 offers a stark contrast with Texas holding a mere 8.43% of the nation\u2019s hash rate. Meanwhile, Georgia dominated with 34.17%. Kentucky and New York claimed 12.40% and 9.53%, respectively.\n\nThe shift in mining dynamics demonstrates the growing participation of U.S. states in Bitcoin mining throughout 2023.\n\nBy July 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s global hash rate surged to a remarkable 400 exahashes per second (EH/s). This was nearly double its level at the close of 2021, which stood at 174 EH/s, as reported by Foundry.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the data collected between 21 and 27 July 2023, coincided with power curtailments in Texas. During these periods, Bitcoin miners reduced their production to align with the grid\u2019s energy supply and demand.\n\nThis practice is essential for maintaining a stable energy grid, especially during peak consumption times. Large energy consumers like Bitcoin miners receive incentives for their flexibility in energy usage.\n\nTexas: The Lone Star of Bitcoin mining\n\nOne prominent player in Texas\u2019 curtailment program is Riot Platforms, a Bitcoin miner that experienced a reduction in mining output from July to August. However, the company received more than $31 million in power credits from the state during this period.\n\nThe Lone Star State has steadily emerged as a hub for cryptocurrency mining, thanks to its cost-effective energy resources and supportive regulatory framework. Data from the Energy Information Administration reveals that Texas boasts electricity prices below the national average.\n\nAs of January 2023, the average residential electricity tariff in Texas stood at a competitive $0.14 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), offering an 8.3% discount compared to the national average of $0.15 per kWh. For large consumers like crypto miners, the cost advantages are even more pronounced.\n\nTexas\u2019 ascent as a cryptocurrency mining powerhouse gained momentum after China\u2019s crackdown on crypto mining activities in 2021. With a combination of abundant and affordable energy resources, a favorable regulatory landscape, and competitive electricity rates, Texas is poised to maintain its leadership position in the Bitcoin mining arena."

        "title": "A Review of Privacy Pools, an Improved Tornado Cash? - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "This privacy paper is basically covering the app, or I guess the concept of the app, that Amin came up with called \u2018privacy pools\u2019 earlier this year in March.\n\nLet\u2019s discover how Privacy Tools works.\n\nWhat is Privacy Pools?\n\nPrivacy Pools is a project aimed to \u201cfix\u201d the popular open-source solution for anonymizing Ethereum transactions in order to make it regulator-friendly. It\u2019s basically the concept of making Tornado Cash or at least forking Tornado Cash, and making it regulatory-compliant.\n\nThis clip gives a good idea of what @VitalikButerin is thinking with Privacy Pools. He thinks that \"guilt\" & \"innocence\" are antiquated terms. According to Vitalik, there should be no expectation of being treated as \"innocent until proven guilty\" when using Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/XNK7mfsy3F \u2014 Chris Blec (@ChrisBlec) September 19, 2023\n\nThe way they do this is by splitting the pools into isolated pools, where you can prove to a regulator that your funds didn\u2019t co-mingle with bad actor funds while still preserving your privacy. This idea is interesting in theory, but it will be interesting to see how it plays out in practice. There are some concerns, such as normalizing censorship and financial surveillance on blockchains. However, when building practical privacy tools, you have to consider the trade-offs.\n\nWe can say Privacy Tools operates similarly to Tornado Cash by mixing multiple user transactions to obscure their true origins. However, when users choose to withdraw funds, they have the option to generate a zero-knowledge proof. The zero-knowledge proof confirms that they are not utilizing a criminal blockchain address while safeguarding their identity.\n\nMore About Privacy Tools\n\nIf we build privacy tools without the ability to prove to authorities that funds didn\u2019t co-mingle with bad actors, they are likely to get sanctioned. Sanctioning may not kill the tools but can have a chilling effect on their usability, locking out users from certain countries. There\u2019s a practical trade-off between providing privacy and satisfying regulatory needs.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that governments around the world may need to understand the practical challenges of enforcing regulations on a global scale. If different countries start sanctioning different privacy protocols, the network could become fragmented.\n\n1/ New privacy paper with @VitalikButerin, Jacob Illum (@chainalysis), @mat_nadler, @fschaer!https://t.co/ovH1iYXXY6 We explored new compliance opportunities made possible by https://t.co/Nt4b2Tgx1D, where users can provably dissociate from illicit funds. story below \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/Tq0zYfbwlL \u2014 Ameen Soleimani (@ameensol) September 6, 2023\n\nSoleimani commented on the paper that they did their best to explain: \u201chow Privacy Pools tech can serve as neutral infrastructure for bringing public blockchains into regulatory compliance\u2014across jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nRegulatory Compliant Privacy\n\nIn order to ensure regulatory compliance, privacy pools can use \u201cassociation sets\u201d to represent a group of wallets that are connected via zero-knowledge proofs. Association set providers (ASPs) are responsible for generating association sets. These ASPs can be entirely constructed on-chain, requiring no human or AI intervention. Alternatively, ASPs can independently generate association sets and publish them on-chain.\n\nCentralization Concerns\n\nThe researchers also address centralization concerns in pool management. They propose a system where pool managers are selected in a decentralized manner and their actions are auditable.\n\nAn excerpt from the paper states that \u201cIn some instances, ASPs- association set providers, tasked with generating association sets can be entirely constructed on-chain, requiring no human (or AI) intervention. Alternatively, ASPs may independently generate association sets and subsequently publish them on-chain.\n\n.@Chainalysis chief scientist Jacob Illum sheds light on how user privacy would be safeguarded in the proposed privacy pools, helping in filtering good deposits from the bad.

It is important to ensure that privacy pools are designed and implemented in a way that minimizes the risk of censorship and financial surveillance. It is also important to educate regulators and authorities about the benefits and challenges of privacy pools so that they can develop sound policies.\n\nEducating regulators and authorities about these challenges may be the only way to make them consider alternative approaches. However, this is challenging, and it\u2019s an ongoing battle.\n\nIn any case, you can check out the paper for more details. It presents an interesting approach to achieving privacy while navigating regulatory complexities.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.
