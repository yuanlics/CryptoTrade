        "title": "This Investing Phenomenon Could Be Why Bitcoin Prices Are Down After ETF Approval - Money",
        "content": "Bitcoin began the year primed for growth. Big things were on the horizon in 2024 \u2014 including the long-awaited approval of bitcoin spot ETFs. But the cryptocurrency community notched that victory in early January, and bitcoin isn\u2019t hurtling into the stratosphere. In fact, it has lost $7,000 in value since the news broke.\n\nThe decline of bitcoin prices despite this recent development might come as a surprise to some, but it\u2019s actually a great example of a broader financial phenomenon in which investments perform poorly in the face of good news.\n\nHere\u2019s why that happens \u2014 and what you should know about buying bitcoin right now.\n\nBitcoin drops in days following spot ETF approvals\n\nOn Jan. 10, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gave the crypto market exactly what it wanted: approval for a spot bitcoin ETF. These exchange-traded funds allow investors to get exposure to bitcoin\u2019s steep rises (and its troughs) without having to actually own the asset, so crypto optimists expected them to bring in lots of new capital (BTW: Financial advisors generally suggest investors devote no more than 5% of their portfolio to risky assets like crypto).\n\nThe news was massive, given that bitcoin fans have been asking for these ETFs for years. The fervor reached a peak recently, with Grayscale taking the SEC to court over its denial of the company\u2019s ETF and finance giants like BlackRock and Fidelity applying for their own. In total, 11 companies saw their applications approved. Crypto enthusiasts predicted a 2021-esque bull run.\n\nIndeed, in the days after the SEC's approval, over $2 billion flowed into bitcoin ETFs. But bitcoin prices themselves sunk. Immediately afterward, the crypto shot up by about $3,000 to a price of $48,600; since then, it has dropped down to $41,000 \u2014 its lowest price since early December.\n\nHow 'selling the news' turns good news into losses\n\nCryptocurrency prices are far more volatile than stocks, but their general movement tends to align closely with the stock market. It makes sense, then, that the crypto market suffers from many of the same peculiarities as stocks. One such quirk is that if a stock performs strongly during earnings season, smashing expectations, there\u2019s a chance that shares will still depreciate.\n\nThis counterintuitive phenomenon is caused by \u201cselling the news,\u201d or the act of profit-taking by shareholders after good news breaks. Active investors might opt to take the short-term profits of good news instead of holding on for future gains. It\u2019s not an act that\u2019s inherently harmful when done by an individual, but a large group of traders selling their shares at once can easily influence prices.\n\nAnd when a group of sellers is larger than the group of potential investors, the flood of shares back into the market can cause a shift in supply and demand that drives share prices lower as a result.\n\nThis helps to explain how bitcoin suffered at the hands of its own success. Bitcoin spot ETFs have been sought out for over 10 years (and for the last two years especially). As it became increasingly more probable that these ETFs would see approval in January, it\u2019s likely that active traders loaded up on bitcoin ahead of time with the expectation that they could take profits on the post-approval boom.\n\nWe can see this reflected in not just the price of bitcoin declining but also the billions of dollars in outflows from exchanges and crypto funds. Grayscale reportedly saw over $2 billion in liquidations from its bitcoin-trust-turned-bitcoin-ETF after the SEC approved it.\n\nAll said, does the decline in bitcoin\u2019s signal that the ETF news isn\u2019t actually as good as once believed? Not really.\n\nExperts still anticipate spot funds for bitcoin will unlock the market for a ton of new investors and send prices back toward all-time highs. They see these losses as just a small setback in the bullish bigger picture; if anything, potential bitcoin investors may take the opportunity to buy bitcoin while it's quote-unquote \"discounted.\"\n\nNewsletter Make smarter money decisions in just a few minutes every day Subscribe to Daily Money to get more of the latest personal finance news, stories, and analysis delivered everyday to your inbox.

        "title": "$13.9B traded in Bitcoin ETFs during week one. - S&P Global",
        "content": "DOWNLOAD PDF VERSION HERE\n\nAfter one week, $13.9B has been traded across the newly approved ETFs. The first week of data has started to show some clear trends.\n\nOn January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved eleven US-Listed exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest in Bitcoin. This has opened up a new asset class for many investors, as the move has simplified the process of gaining direct exposure to the cryptocurrency. The ease of investing in Bitcoin through an ETF structure will not only increase the popularity of this asset class but is also likely to catapult it into the financial mainstream. One week after these new ETFs started trading, and following $1.15B of net flows, some interesting trends have started to emerge.\n\nFund flow data for week one (01/11/24 - 01/18/24):\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ($1.2B) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) ($1B) experienced the largest inflows across all newly formed ETFs during the first week of trading. Blackrock and Fidelity have proved popular amongst investors, receiving a combined 68% of all week one inflows (BITI 37%, FBTC 31%).\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was the first of the group to amass more than $1B in assets, accumulating the largest inflows during the week, and boasting an AUM of $1.17B on January 18th. The value of both ETFs combined inflows ($2.2B) was equal to the value of the outflows seen across the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) ($2.2B) during the period.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced $2,216.3B of outflows during the week. This ETF was the only fund to experience daily outflows during its first week of trading. The meteoric rise in the price of Bitcoin, which pushed ever higher as investors anticipated the approval of these new funds, is believed to have led to profit taking by existing investors in the former closed-end fund. Now converted, existing units can now be traded freely on exchange which lowers the bid /offer spread for investors who would have previously had to trade over the counter, often at a substantial discount to the Bitcoin price.\n\nFund flows have been affected by the decision of some Bitcoin ETF issuers to charge 0% fees for a limited amount of time, with the agreement to raise them when a defined AUM is reached. The majority of the funds are expected to charge between 0.2% and 0.4% in the future. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) continues to charge 1.5%, stating its track record as its differentiating competitive factor. When looking outside the fee, the Grayscale ETF had the lowest average trading spread across the group during the week and experienced the highest trading volumes and values (as seen in the graph below). This suggests that liquidity and price remain important factors for a substantial proportion of the investor base.\n\nAcross all of the newly approved ETFs, the Hashdex Bitcoin Future ETF (DEFI) experienced the lowest traded value over the week ($7.1M). This fund continues to trade Bitcoin futures rather than physical assets. After the fanfare of the most recent approvals, it appears that investors' appetites for the futures equivalent, now that they can access the real thing, are muted.\n\nThe Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) appears to be the ETF of choice when speculating on the price of Bitcoin. As of January 19th, just over 11% of the ETF's shares were borrowed. This is often used as a proxy for short selling, where speculators sell a borrowed stock in anticipation of the price falling, before buying it back at a lower price. This ETF had a significantly higher percentage of its outstanding shares on loan in comparison to the other funds.\n\nSince the launch of these new products the price of Bitcoin has dropped circa 11%. How that impacts investor flows and demand going forward remains to be seen. During the first week of trading, investors have shown a clear interest in the asset class with $13.9B traded and two dominant front runners seen in iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC).\n\nAs the initial flood of new money starts to slow, the landscape is likely to remain competitive. Given the level of investor demand and the fact that the asset class does not provide a yield as returns are based solely upon pricing speculation, these most recently approved ETFs are likely to represent the start of a growing trend of investment strategies to generate returns across this increasingly popular asset class.\n\nFor more information on how to access this data set, please contact the sales team at:\n\nh-ihsm-global-equitysalesspecialists@spglobal.com\n\nS&P Global provides industry-leading data, software and technology platforms and managed services to tackle some of the most difficult challenges in financial markets.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Etherium Fell Today - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Several major cryptocurrencies slumped on Tuesday as investors grappled with the implications over capital inflows to the crypto market following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) landmark approvals of the first spot Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) almost two weeks ago on Jan. 10, 2024.\n\nWhen all was said and done during today's regular trading session, the price of Bitcoin had fallen 2.2%, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) was down 6.4%, and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) had declined 5.9%.\n\nCompany card for Bitcoin CRYPTO:BTC\n\nExcitement is waning for spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe price of Bitcoin, in particular, has declined around 20% from its post-ETF approval highs of around $49,000 as the excitement surrounding the approvals has seemed to wane. That marked a three-year high on Jan. 11, the day after the SEC's formal approval of 11 competing spot Bitcoin ETFs hit the wires.\n\nTo be fair, Bitcoin is also still up more than 70% over the past year. The bulk of that gain came in a multi-month rally that began in Oct. 2023 after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's ruling in August that prevented crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nMany investors considered this a huge deal for the cryptocurrency market in general. ETFs are a much more accessible medium for investors putting their capital to work in cryptocurrency assets, after all, compared to setting up separate crypto accounts or wallets with a crypto-specific broker. ETF shares can be bought and sold throughout the normal trading day through virtually any broker, similar to how retail investors can easily buy and sell publicly traded stocks.\n\nCrypto-industry watchers also mused that once the first spot Bitcoin ETFs were finally approved, it would not only serve as validation for crypto assets as a mainstream investment medium but could also present an enormous windfall for ETF providers as capital surged into crypto assets. According to research from data analytics firm CryptoQuant, the capital influx stemming from spot Bitcoin ETFs has the potential to increase the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization by a total of more than $1 trillion over the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is more than a simple \"sell the news\" event\n\nWhile some investors are undoubtedly taking their quick crypto profits off the table given the massive rally, I think this situation is more than a simple \"sell the news\" event.\n\nAccording to a report from digital asset manager CoinShares this morning, for example, crypto funds saw inflows of \"only\" $1.25 billion in the first week after the launch of the first Bitcoin ETFs. That influx turned to an outflow of $21 million last week, however, as some large institutional investors took advantage of the rally to pare their own positions.\n\nBut even that surprising news requires more perspective. As Bloomberg Intelligence's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out on X this week, the outflows have been primarily fueled by more than $2.2 billion in withdrawals from Grayscale's spot bitcoin ETF alone. Among those large sellers was the estate of former cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which liquidated around $1 billion of its holdings as part of its bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThat could signal a light at the end of this tunnel for crypto bulls, however. There's certainly plenty of work to be done for the cryptocurrency market to gain true acceptance as a mainstream investment option. But it's also not exactly common to see a bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange liquidating its massive positions on the heels of what otherwise should have represented a watershed moment for the crypto asset class.\n\n\n\nOnce the dust settles surrounding the recent spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, I won't be the least bit surprised if the crypto market's outflows turn back to inflows as more investors begin dipping their toes into the crypto pool. If that happens, this pause in Bitcoin's rally might just prove to be short-lived.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Bitcoin price falls 15% following launch of ETFs - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nBitcoin has lost 15 per cent of its value over the past two weeks, as some investors use the much-hyped launch of bitcoin exchange traded funds earlier this month to take profits and exit their holdings of the volatile cryptocurrency.\n\nThe price of bitcoin sank as much as 3 per cent on Tuesday, dipping below $39,000 for the first time since early December, before recovering slightly in afternoon trading.\n\nThe recent losses have unwound part of a huge rally late last year, which came amid fevered speculation that the launch of mainstream stock market funds tracking the world\u2019s leading crypto token would draw in new investors to bitcoin.\n\nBut the flows into the ETFs \u2014 many launched by big Wall Street players such as BlackRock \u2014 have underwhelmed and investors who bought them have been left with hefty losses.\n\nThe 10 new funds launched on January 11, after they were approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, had collectively pulled in $4.7bn by the end of Tuesday, according to crypto investment group CoinShares. Bitcoin traded at $46,100 on the day the ETFs were launched, but has fallen steadily since.\n\nAt the same time, $3.4bn has left Grayscale\u2019s fund, the world\u2019s largest bitcoin investment vehicle, since it converted to an ETF alongside the new launches.\n\nAnalysts think much of the money in the 10 new funds is likely to have come from investors exiting Grayscale, which charges much higher fees than its competitors.\n\n\u201cWhat people didn\u2019t realise is that you would have an enormous exit from Grayscale,\u201d said Douglas Comin, a senior crypto options trader at XBTO. \u201cIf you scratch the surface, you see that most inflows are not new money, it\u2019s just investors moving from Grayscale to another ETF.\n\n\u201cThese ETFs were super highly anticipated, and now we see that [a bitcoin bull run] is not going to materialise, at least not as quickly as the market wanted,\u201d he added.\n\nThe conversion of Grayscale\u2019s 10-year-old bitcoin trust has allowed some of its investors \u2014 who have for years only been able to sell shares in the trust at a large discount to the price of bitcoin \u2014 to exit their holdings altogether. The fund\u2019s overall size has fallen from $28bn earlier this month to $22bn by close of trading on Monday.\n\n\u201cETFs bring liquidity, and while they enable people to come in, they also enable people to exit,\u201d said Varun Paul, director of market infrastructure at blockchain platform Fireblocks. \u201cSome investors are exiting positions after buying bitcoin a long time ago, so they\u2019re in the money.\u201d\n\nGrayscale reduced its 2 per cent management fee to 1.5 per cent as it prepared to launch its ETF, but that rate remains considerably more expensive than its competitors.\n\nIn contrast, BlackRock charges just 0.12 per cent. However, that figure will rise to 0.25 per cent in the next year if its ETF pulls in $5bn in assets under management. The US group has drawn in $1.7bn to date."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency investors spent much of 2023 waiting for good news. Following the late 2022 collapse of FTX \u2014 at the time the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange \u2014 popular digital currency bitcoin traded just north of $16,000 to start the year, a far cry from the more than $60,000 it traded for during 2021's crypto boom. Over the last few months, though, things began looking up. Crypto investors became more and more convinced that the SEC would approve a years-long effort from fund companies to bring a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund to market, a move crypto boosters expected to stoke demand for the popular coin. By the time news broke on Jan. 10 that 11 new bitcoin ETFs would begin trading, crypto investors were taking a victory lap, having bid the coin's price up by 155% in calendar year 2023. So, what now? Are we off to another crypto bull market, or have bitcoin enthusiasts gotten ahead of themselves? \"This is definitely an inflection point,\" says Brian Vendig, president of MJP Wealth Advisors in Westport, Connecticut. Here's what he and other experts say to expect from here.\n\nExpect more demand, and more new funds\n\nThe new wave of bitcoin ETFs makes it easier than ever for investors in more traditional assets, such as stocks and bonds, to dip their toes into crypto. Instead of having to open a separate account to buy crypto \u2014 often with high trading fees \u2014 investors in the ETFs can hold bitcoin right alongside their other investments in their brokerage accounts. That's just the beginning, says Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, an investment firm that offers one of the 11 new funds. \"We think it was a huge step forward that will unlock significant demand, given the cost savings for the retail buyer and security available to institutional purchasers,\" he says. The new ETFs will soon allow advisors who deal with high net worth clients and big money institutions to start incorporating crypto into their portfolios, he adds. \"They don't have the ability to put these bitcoin ETFs into client discretionary portfolios, yet,\" Sigel says. \"But we can observe several banks and brokers already preparing these models, which we expect to emerge later this year.\" Expect more new crypto ETFs, too \u2014 and in different flavors. \"It seems inevitable that we'll have ETFs tied to ether, as a secondary cryptocurrency for people to invest in,\" says Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFI. In the meantime, he says, \"the door is now open for a range of ETFs that include bitcoin as well as other assets.\" Experts say these might be as simple as portfolios that combine bitcoin exposure with mainstream investments, such as those in the S&P 500. More complex so-called alternative strategies are likely to emerge as well, such as funds that use a bitcoin holding to hedge against the performance of other investments.\n\nThe outlook for crypto: 'It's all still speculation'"

        "content": "The price of the cryptocurrency was last lower by nearly 2% at $39,362.00, trimming earlier losses but still adding to its 4% decline from the previous day .\n\nBitcoin extended its recent declines on Tuesday, falling further below $40,000 to its lowest level since the beginning of December.\n\nSome have pointed to short-term selling pressure from exits from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has seen about $2 billion in outflows since Jan. 19 while BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund have each seen more than $1 billion in inflow.\n\n\"The outflow from GBTC should not matter that much as bitcoin's inflow into other ETFs have offset the outflow by $1.2 billion so far,\" said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank. \"It seems that the seemingly large amount of daily outflows from GBTC is affecting the market in a psychological way.\"\n\nInvestors have been waiting out this correction, which was expected by many as a \"sell the news\" phenomenon following the well-telegraphed approval of bitcoin ETFs. Expectations around the event emerged last summer intensified in August, pushing the bitcoin price steadily higher.\n\nNow, traders are sitting on large unrealized profits and analysts say bitcoin's price has a long way to fall before reversing higher. In the near term, $36,000 is the support level to watch, chart analysts have said. Still, chart experts say a new all-time high for bitcoin is still in sight for this year.\n\nThe move in bitcoin continued to pull the rest of the crypto market lower. Ether , fell 7% to $2,170.55. Solana slid 7% along with the token tied to decentralized finance protocol Uniswap. Ripple's XRP fell 5% and dogecoin lost 6%.\n\nCrypto-related equities were under pressure as well. Microstrategy , which has long traded as a proxy for the bitcoin price, lost 4%, while the biggest miners, Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms , each fell about 2%. Coinbase slipped 4%, in part due to a downgrade by JPMorgan, which cited concerns of crypto rally fizzle.\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

        "content": "It can seem silly to apply some traditional market terminology to crypto, such as when a \u201cbear market\u201d is declared because an asset or index has fallen 20% from a recent peak. Historically, a move like that is enough to mark a big regime shift in the stock market, but just another day in the office for the volatile world of crypto trading.\n\n\n\nYet the latest 20% drop in Bitcoin from its recent high is worth some scrutiny. In fact, it could be the most-scrutinized dip of that size in recent memory, given how much hype accompanied the run-up to the launch of exchange-traded funds that invest direct in the original cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nThere are an assortment of reasons being offered for the drop, including the old standby clich\u00e9 of \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d when it comes to ETFs, and some of the usual macro suspects: Interest rates have crept higher in the new year, so has the dollar. Even the ghost of FTX is in the mix! The bankrupt exchange\u2019s estate has been dumping its position in the newly converted Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, and those outflows are destined to be used to pay off creditors rather than recycled into competing Bitcoin ETFs with lower fees.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of what catalysts caused the 20% drop, the key question now is whether the tumble itself will prove to be its own catalyst to frost over the green candles that seemed to have been marking the end of the latest crypto winter. Let\u2019s face it, FOMO \u2013 fear of missing out \u2013 has always been one of the most important drivers in crypto moonshots.\n\n\n\nA recent survey by Deutsche Bank showed that more than one-third of respondents expect Bitcoin to drop below $20,000 by year end, and most consumers expressed concern about the potential collapse of a major cryptocurrency by 2026.\n\n\n\nIn other words, missing out is not exactly the main fear these days in the post-FTX crypto landscape, regardless of how much cheaper, safer and more-convenient the ETFs make it to gain exposure to Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nSo for the moment, all the breathless predictions that the launch of the ETFs would send Bitcoin to a new record high \u2013 or even to $100,000, as some forecast \u2013 seem a little suspect.\n\n\n\nBut after all, tomorrow is another day and the Bitcoin hype machine is poised to pivot to a new talking point: The upcoming halving, when supply of new tokens gets cut in half. How much that\u2019s able to get the FOMO juices flowing again could be the ultimate near-term test of the potential demand for the new ETFs."

        "content": "Just over a year after the crypto winter sent bitcoin miner Core Scientific spiraling into bankruptcy, the Texas-based company is back on the Nasdaq. Trading is scheduled to resume Wednesday morning.\n\nCore, which has operations in five U.S. states \u2014 Texas, North Dakota, North Carolina Georgia, and Kentucky \u2014 mines for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by packing data centers full of specialized computers that crunch math equations to validate transactions and create new tokens. The process requires expensive equipment, technical expertise and a lot of electricity.\n\nAs recently as 2021, Core was one of the largest publicly traded crypto mining firms in the U.S., hitting the market in July of that year via a special purpose acquisition company in a deal that valued it at roughly $4.3 billion. However, bitcoin lost over 60% of its value in 2022, meaning all that digital currency Core was producing was suddenly worth a lot less while operating costs remained high.\n\nWithout sufficient cash on hand to repay the financing debt owed on equipment it was leasing, Core was forced to enter bankruptcy in December 2022. The stock had fallen more than 98%.\n\n\"When bitcoin prices declined and power prices increased, obviously that hurt our levered free cash flow position, as well as hurt our balance sheet, since we were carrying bitcoin on balance sheet,\" Core CEO Adam Sullivan told CNBC in an interview.\n\nRather than liquidating, Core continued to operate and reached a deal with senior security noteholders who hold the bulk of the company's debt.\n\nThe restructuring plan announced Tuesday has slashed $400 million in debt from Core's balance sheet by \"converting equipment lender and convertible note holder debt to equity,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nCore said the new credit facility along with projected operating cash flow will allow the company to \"emerge and continue executing its multi-year growth plan.\"\n\n\"We went through a very successful Chapter 11 bankruptcy process,\" Sullivan said. \"It accomplished exactly what we wanted to accomplish, which was reducing debt and giving us time to pay down any remaining debt on our balance sheet over the course of five years.\"\n\nAlso helping Core as it reenters the public market is an expansive footprint of mines across the country, and investors' renewed enthusiasm toward bitcoin, which jumped 150% in 2023.\n\nEven in bankruptcy, Core invested in developing its infrastructure. In 2023, the company minted 13,762 bitcoin from its fleet of mines, or around $540 million at the token's current price. That doesn't include the profit Core generates from mining coins on behalf of other companies.\n\nCore is in the process of deploying tens of thousands of more mining rigs with the goal of increasing its capacity by more than 50% over the next four years.\n\n\"Our focus is not going to be on the market leadership position, it's going to be on being the most efficient bitcoin mining company and looking at all of our assets inside of our portfolio, so that we can ensure that we're refining power into the highest value compute that we can,\" he said.\n\nThe public markets have been going big in mining since bitcoin started rebounding. Marathon Digital soared more than 590% in 2023 while Riot Blockchain jumped more than 350% and CleanSpark gained over 400%.\n\nChardan Research said in a note on Jan. 8 that Marathon's \"acquisition of hosting facilities signals a shift in management's strategy from asset-light to owner-operator,\" a move that it called a \"meaningful improvement.\"\n\nHeadwinds remain.\n\nBitcoin miners have pared back gains in the last few weeks as the price of bitcoin has fallen, and in April, a market-moving event dubbed the \"halving\" will cut the prize that miners receive in half.\n\nThe halving, which happens roughly every four years, is written into bitcoin's code and is designed to stave off inflation. Though it will immediately impact miner profits, it's also historically proven to be a catalyst for a run-up in the price of bitcoin. During the crypto market's previous bull market run, the world's largest cryptocurrency rose more than 560%.\n\nThere are also new potential opportunities for miners to collect fees, as a startup ecosystem is built on top of bitcoin's base chain, Bernstein said in a note on Jan. 17.\n\n\"It is not surprising that listed U.S miners are investing aggressively to 'land grab' a higher share\" of the $900 billion bitcoin network, the analysts wrote. The firm added that bitcoin miners are \"best positioned to benefit from growing institutionalization and financialization of bitcoin,\" including the buildout of the bitcoin-based payment infrastructure called the Lightning Network, as well as the rising popularity of nonfungible tokens and ordinals minted on bitcoin.\n\n\"We expect 2024 to be a break-out inflection year for crypto,\" Bernstein analysts wrote. \"We recommend achieving Bitcoin exposure via Bitcoin miners.\" The firm said Riot and CleanSpark are its preferred picks.\n\nWATCH: Bitcoin in 2024 - Risks and rewards"

        "content": "According to every key benchmark, the new spot Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) appear to be a remarkable success. In just the first few days, they attracted more than $1 billion in assets. Trading volume has been \"insane,\" according to market participants. And even though Bitcoin actually fell 12% in the week after the introduction of these ETFs, investor appetite still appears to be very strong.\n\nHowever, there are two Bitcoin ETF risks that you won't hear a lot of people talking about. And either could affect how well your investment performs over time.\n\nTracking error risk\n\nThe primary purpose of the new ETFs is to give you exposure to the performance of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin goes up by 10%, your ETF should go up by 10%. And if Bitcoin goes down by 10%, your ETF should go down by 10%. While it might be naive to expect an exact 1:1 match in price, the difference should be fairly negligible, right?\n\nAnd yet, over the first week of trading, the performances of the different Bitcoin ETFs have sometimes been all over the place. I first noticed this when watching an analyst on CNBC explain why the price of Bitcoin was down while in the background, all the tickers for the Bitcoin ETFs were flashing different numbers!\n\nFor example, the new offering from BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT), was down 6%. The new offering from VanEck, the VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF (NYSEMKT: HODL), was down 7%. And the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: BTCW), was down 12%.\n\nWhat concerns me is not that the ETFs are down. That's to be expected, with the price of Bitcoin down. What concerns me is that performance can vary so widely. Such discrepancies are known as tracking errors, and they highlight the potential difficulty of tracking Bitcoin. Keep in mind that Bitcoin is a truly global asset that trades 24 hours a day. That makes it harder to track than, say, the S&P 500 index, which trades during regular market hours.\n\nStory continues\n\nCustodial risk\n\nThe other risk is called custodial risk. This is the risk of incurring a loss on your assets in the event of a custodian's insolvency, negligence, fraud, poor cybersecurity standards, or inadequate record-keeping.\n\nThis matters because the custodian for much of the Bitcoin held by the big Wall Street players will be cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN). In fact, eight of the 11 Bitcoin ETFs have chosen Coinbase as their custodian.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nTo conceptualize this, imagine Coinbase having a vast digital vault filled with safe deposit boxes where 70% of Wall Street's Bitcoin is being held. In this analogy, each safe deposit box would correspond to a different blockchain wallet and could be opened only with the right cryptographic keys.\n\nThis doesn't sound risky, but to understand what could go wrong, all you have to do is think back to November 2022, when cryptocurrency exchange FTX went belly up. As it turns out, the crypto exchange was commingling customer funds with funds from its own trading desk. And there are plenty of examples from the early days of Bitcoin, when cybercriminals specifically targeted large crypto exchanges such as Mt. Gox in order to steal Bitcoin.\n\nThis is not to say that there excessive risk right now with Coinbase Global. I'm sure that multiple layers of security protect the Bitcoin holdings. But articles musing about the potential for something to go very wrong have already appeared in financial media. What if, for example, cybercriminals decide to target Coinbase as part of some coordinated hacking exploit to steal Wall Street's crypto?\n\nUnderstand what you're buying before you buy it\n\nPerhaps the biggest takeaway here is that it's important to understand what you're buying before you buy it. You don't need in-depth knowledge of how the crypto market works or even how an ETF works, but you should have a basic understanding of the potential risks of buying Bitcoin via an ETF.\n\nThat said, I'm still long-term bullish on Bitcoin. But I'll definitely be keeping a close eye on how Wall Street deals with any potential risks unique to the new spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market started 2024 on a positive note after an impressive rally last year. The much-hyped reformation in the cryptocurrency space took place on Jan 10. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved rule changes to allow the creation of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As many as,11 spot bitcoin ETF\u2019s are expected to be launched this year.\n\nThe game-changing decision of the SEC will allow individuals, money managers and other financial institutions to get exposure to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency without having to own it. For a long time, the SEC was reluctant to approve the so-called spot bitcoin ETFs. However, the situation changed after the SEC lost a lawsuit to Grayscale in August 2023.\n\nFollowing the news, the price of bitcoin (BTC) jumped above the technical barrier of 47,000 to reach 47.893.70. However, Bitcoin price has since fallen sharply. On Jan 22, Bitcoin traded lower by nearly 3% at $39,854.61, hitting its lowest level since December 2023.\n\nNevertheless, bitcoin continues to hold a lot of potential. The SEC\u2019s latest decision is likely to turn out to be a landmark, positioning the entire crypto space as an integral component of mainstream finance.\n\nTechnically, the Fed is set to initiate the first cut in interest rate in 2024 since March 2020, which saw the advent of the coronavirus pandemic. A lower interest rate regime should be very helpful for high-growth sectors like technology and cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the largest thrust for the crypto space has come from institutional investors.\n\nMoreover, the next Bitcoin Halving will occur in the first half of 2024. When a halving occurs, the reward for mining new blocks is halved, making it more challenging for miners to earn net Bitcoins. Historically, this event has led to increased scarcity and has driven up the value of Bitcoin due to reduced supply.\n\nStocks in Focus\n\nNVIDIA Corp. NVDA is a semiconductor industry giant and one of the biggest success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the NVDA stock usually soars on a booming crypto market. This is because GPUs are pivotal to data centers, artificial intelligence, and the creation of crypto assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 63.1% (ending January 2025).

        "title": "MacOS Malware Targets Bitcoin, Exodus Cryptowallets - Dark Reading",
        "content": "Fresh malware targeting Apple users in the US and Germany is infecting Bitcoin and Exodus cryptowallet applications with a Trojan distributed through pirated software, according to Kaspersky researchers.\n\nThe malware is delivered via cracked applications and can replace Exodus and Bitcoin cryptowallet applications installed on the user's machine with infected versions that steal secret recovery phrases after the wallet is unlocked.\n\nThe report, issued this week, noted the attackers use DNS TXT records to deliver an encrypted Python script to their victims as the second stage of infection.\n\n\"The wallet application replacement process is straightforward because, at this stage, the malware already has root access to the computer, granted during the first stage of infection,\" explains Sergey Puzan, security expert at Kaspersky.\n\nThe malware simply removes the old application from the \"/Applications/\" directory and replaces it with a new, malicious one. After installation and the patching process, the applications become operational, and the user is unaware of the malware running in the background.\n\nWhen users launch these compromised wallet applications, the malware sends data, including seed phrases or wallet passwords, to a command-and-control (C2) server controlled by the attackers.\n\nThis can result in the attackers having full control of a victim's digital wallet.\n\n\"We don't know why the malware specifically targets 'fresh' macOS versions, but it appears this campaign was still in the development process,\" Puzan says. \"We managed to receive functionality updates for the final stage backdoor but received no commands from the server.\"\n\nHe added there are no specific reasons why attackers focus on macOS 13.6 (Ventura) and higher.\n\n\"The only reason malicious actors use cracked versions of applications is to lower the user's guard and prompt them to enter the admin password, thereby granting root access to the malicious process,\" Puzan explains.\n\nHe says the form protection from such threats is to avoid downloading any cracked or modified applications, even from well-known and trusted sources.\n\n\"While this isn't a foolproof method, it significantly reduces the chances of compromise,\" Puzan says.\n\nJohn Bambenek, president at Bambenek Consulting, says while the use of pirated applications as a vehicle for malware isn't a particularly new technique, the selection of macOSX applications with functionality to steal cryptocurrency wallets is unique.\n\n\"As the security to prevent stealing cryptocurrency relies on the privacy of the private wallet key and passphrase, stealing both means the attacker can immediately monetize the victim,\" he explains.\n\nEvolving Threats to Cryptocurrency Wallets\n\nIn 2023, there were numerous malicious campaigns targeting cryptocurrency wallet owners, but the Kaspersky findings indicate that some attackers are now going to greater lengths to ensure they access the contents of their victims' crypto wallets while remaining undetected for as long as possible.\n\n\"While it's challenging to predict the threats we'll face in 2024, the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies is attracting heightened criminal activity,\" Puzan says.\n\nAdam Neel, threat detection engineer at Critical Start, notes that malicious actors are adapting their techniques to take advantage of cryptocurrency users' behaviors and preferences.\n\n\"They use social engineering tactics, such as offering pirated software, to lure victims into downloading malware,\" he says. \"The malware's ability to replace legitimate wallet applications and continue operating even when the C2 server is unresponsive demonstrates a level of persistence that can be challenging for users to detect and remove.\"\n\nBambenek notes many of the OS-provided protections needed to be explicitly disabled to get these applications on the system in the first place, so the biggest defense mechanism is to avoid pirated software and source applications only from the official app store.\n\n\"For those users who still want pirated applications, they should keep cryptocurrency applications and their private wallets on secure machines that do not have such software downloaded and installed on it,\" he says.\n\nNeel says users must continue to take precautions, especially when storing large amounts of digital currency.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency remains an attractive target for cyber criminals, so malicious actors will be motivated to advance their behaviors and technology,\" he says."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nA false post on the official X social media page of the US Securities and Exchange Commission that prematurely claimed it had approved new bitcoin investment products appeared after a hacker took control of the mobile phone number linked to the account, according to the regulator.\n\nThe widely shared post on January 9 saying that the SEC had given the green light to the first bitcoin exchange traded funds momentarily sent the cryptocurrency sector into a frenzy. It was quickly disavowed by the agency, which announced its bona fide approvals a day later.\n\nThe SEC on Monday said it determined that an unauthorised party had deployed an apparent \u201cSIM swap\u201d, which involves transferring a mobile phone number to a different device without the owner\u2019s permission. The password for the SEC\u2019s account on X was then changed.\n\nThe number transfer occurred via the telecommunications carrier rather than through the agency\u2019s systems, the SEC said. The regulator added it had not found any evidence that the hacker gained access to its systems, devices, data or other social media accounts.\n\nThe agency also disclosed that X in July had disabled multi-factor authentication at the SEC\u2019s request \u201cdue to issues accessing the account\u201d. The procedure was reinstated after the page was breached and was enabled for all SEC social media accounts offering such authentication, the regulator said.\n\nThe mishap was an embarrassment for the agency after its chair Gary Gensler made cyber security a pillar of his agenda, adopting rules that require businesses be more vigilant about cyber risks.\n\nWhile the hack was not serious by cyber standards, given that it did not affect the SEC\u2019s own systems, analysts found the absence of two-factor authentication, first disclosed by X, to be an easily avoidable faux pas. \u201cWe encourage all users to enable this extra layer of security,\u201d X said the day of the incident.\n\nThe fake post came as Wall Street eagerly awaited SEC authorisation of the first-ever spot bitcoin ETFs, which enable ordinary investors to hold the cryptocurrency in their brokerage accounts. Gensler has expressed scepticism over crypto, calling the markets the \u201cwild west\u201d.\n\nGensler has adopted a tough enforcement stance against crypto and argued that many digital tokens are securities that fall directly within the agency\u2019s purview. The SEC already regulates ETFs.\n\nThe day of the hack, Gensler posted on his own X account 10 minutes after the fake post was published, saying the regulator\u2019s account had been \u201ccompromised\u201d and no ETF approvals had been granted.\n\nThe regulator on Monday said it was still co-ordinating with law enforcement as well as federal agencies including the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. According to the SEC, the probe\u2019s focus includes how the hacker had the telecoms carrier change the SIM and how they became aware of the account\u2019s number."

ETF options saw average daily volumes amounting to roughly 17.9 million contracts in 2023, according to Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) data \u2014 a 12% increase from the prior year.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF Tracker\n\nThe Cboe Options Exchange submitted a proposal to the SEC on Jan. 5 seeking to list options on exchange-traded products (ETPs) that hold bitcoin. The filing came about a week before the regulator officially greenlit such ETFs.\n\nNYSE Arca and Nasdaq followed suit days later, separate disclosures indicate.\n\nThough Cboe\u2019s rules generally permit it to list options on ETPs three days after they start trading, they don\u2019t apply to such products holding commodities like BTC, the company said in a filing.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\n\u201cCboe intends to list these options as soon as all regulatory approvals are received, which is expected later in 2024,\u201d the company noted.\n\nThe SEC noted in Jan. 19 filings that it would seek comments on the three stock exchanges\u2019 proposals during a 21-day period.\n\nThe Nasdaq-related filing refers directly to BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The exchange would open at least one expiration month for options on the trust. It could also list such options for trading on a weekly or quarterly basis.\n\nNasdaq believes that options on IBIT would offer investors \u201can additional, relatively lower cost investing tool to gain exposure to spot bitcoin as well as a hedging vehicle to meet their investment needs in connection with bitcoin products and positions,\u201d the disclosure states.\n\n\n\nRead more: BlackRock beats spot bitcoin ETF rivals in race to $1B assets\n\nChase White is a senior analyst at Compass Point Research and Trading. He told Blockworks that options on the spot bitcoin ETFs are likely to appeal to institutional investors looking to hedge their downside risk in the funds, whether they\u2019re long or short the ETFs.\n\n\u201cWe also expect some level of institutional investor speculation via the options, because many of them don\u2019t have the mandate to transact in options [and] derivatives directly tied to BTC \u2014 much like they don\u2019t have the mandate to trade BTC itself,\u201d White said.\n\nAs more financial advisers start to allocate a portion of client funds to the ETFs, such professionals could use options to protect against downside risk without having to take taxable gains on the ETF positions, he added.\n\nMatt Lason, chief investment officer of crypto hedge fund Globe 3 Capital, said options on spot bitcoin ETFs reflect the \u201cnatural progression of financial instruments\u201d given that \u201cthe dam has broken open\u201d following the SEC\u2019s approval of such funds.\n\nRead more: The crypto world reacts to day one of bitcoin spot ETF trading\n\n\u201cWe believe the SEC would be quick to allow the listing of options on spot bitcoin ETFs as it does not require the ownership of the underlying asset,\u201d he told Blockworks. \u201cEven though these options and derivatives do not create direct ownership in bitcoin, it brings additional liquidity to bitcoin, and that is the more important piece of the equation for this asset.\u201d\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said in an X post last week the SEC could allow options on spot bitcoin ETFs by the end of February. The regulator, however, could wait until as late as September to make a decision, he added.\n\nBecause the ETFs were approved and are already trading, the SEC doesn\u2019t have a good legal reason to reject the applications, White argued.\n\nHe added: \u201cGiven it\u2019s an election year, the SEC will probably not want to do anything controversial close to the election, so we tend to think we\u2019ll get approvals sometime before summer.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin would be in a bear market going by old-world definitions. Luckily they don\u2019t apply well to crypto.\n\nA parable of legacy finance says that bear markets start when a broad index of stocks, say the S&P 500, sinks 20% or more from recent highs.\n\nBitcoin is practically the exact opposite of something like the S&P 500, but it has done exactly that since spot bitcoin ETFs went live earlier this month.\n\nThe price of bitcoin briefly hit $49,000 moments after BlackRock, Fidelity and eight others launched their funds on Jan. 11.\n\nTwelve days later, bitcoin changed hands for $38,500 \u2014 a 21% drop. Anyone holding spot bitcoin ETFs since they went live are well in the red.\n\nRead more: Let\u2019s pour one out for the first-day spot bitcoin ETF investors\n\nThe timing of bitcoin\u2019s recent correction is unfortunate and it may even be the result of Grayscale losing the management fee war.\n\nBut drops of this magnitude are common in bitcoin bull markets. This would be the fourth pullback of this size in our current cycle.\n\n(Calculations of the exact beginning and end of bitcoin market cycles vary, but for the purposes of this article, our current bull market started on Nov. 21, 2022 per analysis from IOSG Ventures.)\n\nPrice discovery is very rarely a straight line\n\nAnalyzing daily bitcoin price movements shows similar retracements occurred in March, June and August 2023. Bitcoin\u2019s price has still doubled its lowest point from last year.\n\nThere have been six bull cycles in bitcoin\u2019s history, not counting the 500-fold explosion in the highly eventful two years following the genesis block in 2009, which included the rise of influential platforms Silk Road and Mt. Gox, as well as the disappearance of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe first proper bull cycle, between February 2011 and April 2013, included 19 corrections of 20% or more \u2014 often extremely close to each other with June 2011 alone seeing four.\n\nThe next cycle, in 2013, was the shortest, running only 150 days. There were five corrections akin to bitcoin\u2019s recent movements and they generally occurred once every two weeks or so.\n\nIn fact, the length of time between 20% corrections is increasing over time. They happened once every 64 days on average during the 2015-2017 bull market, during which time ballooned up to 8,900%.\n\nBitcoin has grown up but it hasn\u2019t yet totally shaken these kinds of corrections\n\nThe next cycle between 2018 and 2019 felt comparable shocks every 73 days, around the same frequency as the 2020-2021 run. Bitcoin more than tripled in about 200 days, from $4,100 to nearly $12,800, to start the decade.\n\nThis time around, bitcoin\u2019s is giving up one-fifth of its value every 102 days on average \u2014 40% more than during the previous two bull markets. This trend is also illustrated well by bitcoin\u2019s historic volatility, which is flatlining over time.\n\nThen again, this kind of analysis only works with the benefit of hindsight. All bull markets, of course, end with a collapse in prices of 20% or more and nobody knows whether this month\u2019s pullback was our cycle\u2019s last.\n\nAt least they\u2019re getting rarer.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Better Buy: iShares Bitcoin Trust or Actual Bitcoin Tokens? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "All of a sudden, investors have access to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the real-time value of Bitcoin (BTC -4.70%). American regulators finally approved 11 applications for Bitcoin-tracking ETFs, opening a whole new type of digital asset investments.\n\nMaybe you haven't dipped your toes in the unpredictable cryptocurrency waters yet, but you're thinking about your first Bitcoin investment. Should you dive into the deep end with a direct buy of Bitcoin tokens, or is a robust ETF like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT -5.82%) a better choice?\n\nThe answer, of course, is that it depends on your needs and preferences. Let me walk you through the pros and cons of these two options for Bitcoin exposure.\n\nWhy iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF may be for you\n\nThis is not the only Bitcoin ETF on the market today, but it's an early leader for several solid reasons.\n\nThe largest and most popular Bitcoin ETF in the early days has already built a $1.2 billion portfolio of Bitcoin holdings. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust runs a close second with a net asset value (NAV) just north of $1 billion as of Friday, Jan. 19. Beyond Fidelity, it's not a close race. Each of the other nine Bitcoin ETFs is worth less than half of the iShares fund so far.\n\nThe fund trades at a 0.3% discount to its underlying NAV, reflecting the live Bitcoin price of an index called the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate-New York Variant (BRR). In turn, the BRR index tracks the average Bitcoin price in U.S. dollars across six leading crypto exchanges. This methodology ensures a stable Bitcoin price, shielded from the sudden price swings you sometimes see in a cryptocurrency (or stock) on a single trading platform.\n\nThe iShares fund is managed by BlackRock, one of the world's largest and most respectable financial asset managers. Investors have relied on the iShares brand of index-trading funds for decades, with 29 ETFs holding at least $20 billion in NAVs.\n\nSuppose you want ultimate stability in a strictly regulated investment vehicle, with the backing of a true financial services giant under a household name brand of ETFs. In that case, the iShares Bitcoin Trust should be right up your alley. And if you're planning to add Bitcoin exposure in an account that doesn't offer direct Bitcoin trading, an ETF may be your only choice. For example, many IRA retirement accounts provide access to stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs, but not to cryptocurrency tokens.\n\nWhy you might prefer buying Bitcoin directly\n\nHere's why making the effort to open an account on an exchange with cryptocurrency trading such as Coinbase Global or Robinhood Markets may be worth it for some people.\n\nAll ETFs charge an annual fee. Most of the new Bitcoin ETFs carry very low fees of 0.3% or less, and most of them are pausing their fee collections for a few months in order to earn more investor attention. The iShares Bitcoin Trust's sponsor fee stands at 0.25%, cut in half for the first year or until the fund's asset value exceeds $5 billion.\n\nThat's not a deal-breaker for most investors. Still, a low fee is more expensive than no fee, and nobody will charge you an annual fee for holding Bitcoin tokens in a digital wallet.\n\nThat digital wallet is another popular selling point. Direct ownership gives you full control over your cryptocurrency assets, much like carrying dollar bills in a leather wallet instead of a bank account.\n\nThe iShares fund comes with a significant market footprint, managing one of the largest Bitcoin portfolios in the world, but it's just 0.16% of the entire Bitcoin asset. The leading cryptocurrency's total market value stands at $804 billion today, with a daily trading volume of $11.7 billion. I wouldn't be surprised to see a Bitcoin logo when I look up \"liquidity\" in a dictionary.\n\nSome investors prefer to keep their holdings as pure and simple as possible. For some, that quest for simplicity will point to the stock-like trading process of an ETF. For others, it means going straight to the source and buying the real thing. True purists like MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor will never buy Bitcoin ETFs as long as the digital tokens are readily available.\n\nBrief summary: Which Bitcoin bet is better for you?\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrency investments, choosing the right path can feel like navigating a labyrinth. Today I explored two distinct paths: the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF and buying Bitcoin directly. Each alternative offers unique advantages tailored to different investor profiles.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF might be your beacon if you seek a regulated, stock market-traded avenue into Bitcoin with a diversified risk profile. In some cases, an ETF may be the only available option.\n\nOn the other hand, purchasing Bitcoin directly could be your next step forward if you aim for a more hands-on approach with potentially higher rewards (and risks).\n\nSo, which path should you take? The answer isn't set in stone; it depends on your investment style, risk tolerance, available brokerage account types, and goals. I hope this overview helps you make the best choice for your particular situation. Mind you, this is far from a complete analysis, and you could spend hours getting deeper into the details.\n\nWhatever you do, your favorite Bitcoin investment should be a small part of a diversified investment portfolio. \"Backing up the truck\" to a single investment is never a good idea -- unless that all-in investment involves an inherently diverse instrument such as an index fund."

        "content": "Bitcoin kicked off the cryptocurrency revolution with Satoshi\u2019s white paper more than 15 years ago. First-mover advantage and strong security make bitcoin a great store of value \u2014 to the extent that some nations have made it legal currency \u2014 but bitcoin isn\u2019t really used for lending, yield farming and other DeFi services.\n\nThat\u2019s a market that\u2019s worth $50 billion right now, according to DeFiLlama data. Not only are bitcoin holders missing out on a chance to monetize their digital asset, but DeFi projects are missing the vast liquidity bitcoin \u2014 and its $850 billion market cap \u2014 has to offer. Bringing bitcoin into the Web3 fold is an immediate opportunity that stands to benefit all of Web3.\n\nEarly promise\n\nInitially, technology was the inhibitor to bringing bitcoin into DeFi, but the introduction of Bitcoin\u2019s Taproot upgrade a year ago went some way to changing things. It enabled newer features and options that Ethereum and other chains boast without the need for a layer-2 such as the Lightning Network.\n\nTaproot enabled truer DeFi services and NFTs, including Ordinals \u2014 which in turn enabled NFT-like inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain and launched with the simple goal to \u201cMAKE BITCOIN FUN AGAIN,\u201d according to its creator Casey Rodarmor. Taproot Wizards, a NFT collection enabled by Ordinals, went further still. Its high-profile creators Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer promise to make Bitcoin \u201cmagic again.\u201d\n\nBut Bitcoin doesn\u2019t need to be fun or magic \u2014 it just needs to seize the opportunities that other chains and communities have enjoyed for years.\n\nThe issue is both an educational and a tooling problem. As a result, the Bitcoin community misses out on opportunities to monetize their assets, including using their bitcoin in DeFi for lending, yield farming, liquidity farming, staking and even easy access to NFTs, gaming, emerging services like SocialFi, and more.\n\nThese services are important not just because they encourage owners to hold on to their assets, (rather than selling), which can help maintain price stability, as well as directly monetize through yield, but they encourage bitcoin holders to do so away from centralized exchanges. DeFi protocols offer better prices and also puts security of assets into an individual\u2019s own control, which is in line with keeping to the principles for freedom of money set out by Satoshi.\n\nTechnologies introduced over the last year have taken the opportunities with Bitcoin to new levels. Rather than relying on services enabled by Taproot, Bitcoin chains like Stacks or the likes of Lightning Network, multichain networks have emerged to enable smart contracts to effectively be deployed on Bitcoin.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Gary Gensler lost the bitcoin ETF battle. Can he win his crypto war?\n\nThis is important because institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies \u2014 which will officially begin after this recent approval for the long-anticipated bitcoin ETFs \u2014 will drive demand for financial products on Bitcoin, not to mention opportunities to connect Bitcoin to other smart contract financial services such as restaking, DeFi and more.\n\nRestaking is a particularly powerful concept, with Eigenlayer adding the primitive to not only offer additional yield but enhance security. The growth of Lido (a top 10 token), Rocketpool (a top 50 token) and others on Ethereum made liquid staking a red hot topic. Similar offerings on Bitcoin would enable passive bitcoin holders to go after new yield opportunities while also holding their assets for the long term.\n\nNew use cases arise\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Bitcoin is its strong community. This is one area where there has been pushback to building on the blockchain. Ordinals, for example, were initially criticized by so-called Bitcoin maximalists who believe the asset\u2019s sole purpose is to store value. But they became a mainstay, racking up 350,000 daily inscriptions this summer and indicating that there\u2019s strong interest in new types of services on Bitcoin even if the entire community isn\u2019t convinced.\n\nIndeed, just this month, top exchanges Binance, Gate.io and KuCoin listed BRC-20 memecoins based on Ordinals, showing another side to their rising appeal.\n\nOrdinals and memecoins sit on the more playful side of crypto, but their popularity gives a glimpse at the interaction and demand that could be tapped by including Bitcoin in the broader decentralized app ecosystem.\n\nThese opportunities won\u2019t appeal to all bitcoin holders, of course, but more options is always preferential to scant few. Moreover, it stands to strengthen Bitcoin by enabling broader adoption among new audiences, which is ultimately the goal as articulated in Satoshi\u2019s white paper.\n\nInstitutional adoption looks promising, there\u2019s general optimism now that the US has approved a bitcoin ETF, which stands to benefit Bitcoin and add new stakeholders. In the long term, many of these new owners will demand options for putting their digital assets to work, especially those financial institutions. Outside of Bitcoin, the broader crypto industry stands to only benefit by including Bitcoin, particularly in this winter period.\n\nIt\u2019s high time Bitcoin was no longer siloed.\n\nBrandon Truong is lead product contributor for ZetaChain. He previously co-founded social platform Yada (which was acquired in 2020) and spent time building products for BuzzFeed and Udacity.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "This Bitcoin News May Spell Trouble for MicroStrategy in 2024. Here's Why - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Huge news rocked the cryptocurrency sector last week. After many years of waiting, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved investment companies to start listing Bitcoin ETFs that people can buy or sell to get exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. Now, there are numerous ETFs that anyone reading this can buy and sell, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.\n\nWhile new ETFs will make it easier -- for better or worse -- for people to get exposure to Bitcoin, this could spell trouble for certain companies in the crypto space. One is Coinbase, which earns large trading fees when people buy or sell crypto on its platform. Another is MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.06%), a software company that has pivoted in recent years to bet big on the future of Bitcoin. Here's why these new ETFs may have just ruined MicroStrategy's Bitcoin pivot, and why it may spell trouble for the stock in 2024.\n\nMicroStrategy: Unprofitable software, betting on Bitcoin\n\nMicroStrategy came of age during the dot-com bubble. It sells business intelligence software, although it hasn't seen much success in recent years. Despite the huge boom in software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies over the past decade, MicroStrategy's software segment has struggled. Revenue has stagnated for years, and in fact, it's actually down compared to 10 years ago.\n\nThe segment is not consistently profitable, either. Over the first nine months of 2023, MicroStrategy has posted an operating loss of $72 million on just $372 million in revenue.\n\nYet MicroStrategy's stock is up over 250% in the last five years. Why? One word: Bitcoin. The company's former CEO, Michael Saylor, made a huge pivot to treat MicroStrategy as an investment vehicle for Bitcoin. According to its latest update, the company held 189,000 Bitcoin on its balance sheet, which has a value of $7.77 billion at the time of this writing. Given the enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies among a good chunk of the world's population, it is unsurprising to see MicroStrategy's shares up so much in the past few years.\n\nETFs spell trouble for its strategy\n\nBefore these ETFs, it was much harder for people to get exposure to Bitcoin without paying high trading fees. On platforms like Coinbase, you might have to pay 1% or more of your purchase in trading fees, which can add up if you are frequently buying and selling shares. MicroStrategy, as a separate publicly traded company that you can buy through commission-free brokerages, ended up as a bit of a loophole for investors looking to get exposure to Bitcoin. Why pay a 1% fee to Coinbase when you can get the same Bitcoin exposure by owning MicroStrategy?\n\nWell, that loophole looks unnecessary today with these new ETFs, some of which have annual fees as low as 0.20%. Now, anyone can easily get exposure to Bitcoin as simply as they would for a publicly traded company. With the software business losing money and probably worth little -- if anything at all -- to shareholders, shareholders in MicroStrategy are likely questioning their investment in the company.\n\nIf you add back the debt, the math doesn't make sense\n\nLet's say MicroStrategy was equivalent to a Bitcoin ETF. We can even add that you have confidence in Phong Le as the CEO and that you want to bet on him over the long term. Even if this were the case, MicroStrategy looks overvalued.\n\nKey Figure Value MicroStrategy Net Asset Value $5.7 billion MicroStrategy Market Cap $7.6 billion MicroStrategy Premium (discount) to Net Asset Value $1.9 billion\n\nIts Bitcoin holdings are currently worth $7.77 billion. Its market cap is roughly $7.6 billion at the time of this writing, which is slightly less than the spot value of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. But to buy this Bitcoin, MicroStrategy has taken out long-term debt worth $2.1 billion, which has an estimated annualized interest expense of $35.5 million. MicroStrategy will have to pay this debt back eventually (in dollars, I might add). Subtract this from its Bitcoin holdings, add back the $45 million in cash on the balance sheet, and MicroStrategy's net asset value held on its balance sheet is under $6 billion -- much lower than its market cap. And it still has an unprofitable software company and these interest payments that it will have to deal with every year going forward.\n\nInvestors are paying a significant premium when buying MicroStrategy if they want to get exposure to Bitcoin. With much easier methods emerging in these Bitcoin ETFs, it is likely that MicroStrategy shares will run into trouble in 2024. Avoid this stock right now -- there are much better ways to get exposure to Bitcoin these days."

        "content": "The price of bitcoin tumbled to its lowest level last Thursday since the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of spot bitcoin ETFs on 10 January.\n\nFollowing the greenlight, the world's largest cryptocurrency has dropped over 11%, with its value stooping by 4.5% last Thursday, falling to a monthly low of $40,800.\n\nThis fall in value sat in contrast to predictions of crypto advocates who viewed spot ETF approvals as a pivotal development for bitcoin, solidifying its place as a large-scale traditional investment.\n\nFurther compounding challenges was $1.5bn flowing out of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), revealed by a JP Morgan research report last Friday.\n\nGBTC was touted as a key player in advocating for legal spot ETFs in the US and was converted to an ETF last week.\n\nThe report highlighted that those investing in GBTC \u2013 who over the last year had been buying at a marked discount to NAV position ahead of its ETF conversion \u2013 are now cashing in following its ETF conversion by exiting the bitcoin space entirely rather than shifting to cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nNikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director of global markets strategy at JP Morgan, said: \u201cWe had previously estimated that up to $3bn had been invested into GBTC in the secondary market during 2023 in order to take advantage of the discount to NAV.\"\n\n\u201cIf the previous $3bn estimate proves correct and given $1.5bn has exited already then there could be an additional $1.5bn still to exit the bitcoin space via profit taking on GBTC, therefore putting further pressure on bitcoin prices over the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nGBTC's challenges are further intensified by its hefty management fee of 1.5%. The report noted the ongoing outflows from GBTC are mounting pressure on the ETF to lower its fee structure.\n\nThe figure lies markedly above other key market players, with BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) both charging a competitive 0.25% fee.\n\nLow fees explain the draw from investors, with Bloomberg data revealing that IBIT received $371m from investors last Wednesday, closely followed by FBTC, witnessing a record $358m inflows, the largest single-day amount since its inception last week.\n\nBlackRock and Fidelity together have garnered 68% of the total inflows into the nine new ETFs in the market, amounting to nearly $2bn.\n\nThe report concluded that competition could pose a risk of further outflows from GBTC, with the ETF carrying the most expensive fee among its counterparts."

        "title": "SEC blames \u2018SIM swap\u2019 attack for disastrous X hack ahead of Bitcoin ETF approval - Fortune",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission provided an update on Monday to a hacking incident from earlier this month that sent ripples through the crypto industry ahead of the agency\u2019s anticipated approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn a statement shared with Fortune, an SEC spokesperson said the agency was the victim of a \u201cSIM swap\u201d attack\u2014a technique in which cybercriminals convince mobile carriers to transfer phone numbers to a new account.\n\nWhile Monday\u2019s explanation provides additional context as to how a hacker gained unauthorized control of a key government office\u2019s social media account, the SEC said it\u2019s still working with law enforcement agencies to determine who carried out the attack.\n\nThe hack\n\nOn Jan. 9, crypto industry onlookers monitored SEC accounts for any notice of the agency\u2019s decision on Bitcoin ETFs, a financial vehicle that would allow investors to trade the popular cryptocurrency as shares on major exchanges. After years of rejecting applications for Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC was poised to approve the applications of a dozen-odd firms, including BlackRock.\n\nWhile analysts predicted the decision would come on Jan. 10, the SEC\u2019s official X (formerly Twitter) account made a surprising announcement just after markets closed on Jan. 9: The agency had approved every application. Many on the social media platform were celebrating.\n\nStill, something seemed off. There were no new filings to support the decisions, and the SEC did not post any updated news on its website. Soon after, Chair Gary Gensler posted on his own account that the SEC\u2019s account had been \u201ccompromised\u201d and that the agency had not yet approved the listing or trading of any of the ETFs.\n\nAs speculation swirled, SEC staff clarified that someone had gained unauthorized access to the agency\u2019s X account, and officials were working with law enforcement officials to find the culprit.\n\nCriticism poured in from all sides, with gleeful crypto advocates pointing to past SEC guidance on cybersecurity practices, and lawmakers from both parties calling for an investigation into what happened.\n\n\u2018Issues accessing the account\u2019\n\nThe SEC is still investigating how the hacker was able to persuade the carrier to change the SIM for its account, and how they knew which phone number was associated with the account.\n\nSIM swaps are often carried out through social engineering: A cybercriminal calls a cell phone provider such as T-Mobile and convinces an agent to transfer over the control of a phone number to a new SIM card. With control of the phone number, the attacker can reset passwords and take over the victim\u2019s accounts.\n\nThe attacks are common in crypto, with Vitalik Buterin\u2014the cofounder of Ethereum\u2014losing access to his X account in an incident in September, with a hacker posting a malicious link to Buterin\u2019s page and stealing over $691,000 from unsuspecting victims.\n\nOne protection against SIM swaps is multifactor authentication, which provides an additional layer of defense. According to the SEC spokesperson, the agency\u2019s X account had multifactor authentication enabled but removed it in July because of \u201cissues accessing the account,\u201d adding that the feature since has been enabled on every SEC social account where available.\n\nUnder Elon Musk\u2019s ownership, X has faced criticism over cybersecurity, including for removing SMS-based multifactor authentication for nonsubscribers in February. Still, cybersecurity experts have long warned that SMS-based multifactor authentication is weaker than other forms because it is vulnerable to SIM swapping and urged users to rely instead on authentication apps or physical security keys.\n\nThe SEC did not have any multifactor authentication enabled. The spokesperson said that the hacker reset the password once in control of the number, although did not specify the exact mechanics.\n\nThe spokesperson said the agency is coordinating with different law enforcement and federal oversight agencies, including the SEC\u2019s Office of Inspector General, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice.\n\nThe spokesperson said there\u2019s no evidence that the hacker gained access to SEC systems, data, devices, or other social platforms."

After that it will charge 0.21 per cent.\n\nBlackRock investors will pay 0.25 per cent for its product, although early investors can access it at 0.12 per cent for the first year until assets reach $5bn.\n\nThe US \u201cprice wars\u201d have settled at a level around 30 basis points, said HanETF chief executive Hector McNeil.\n\nBelow 30 bps, providers \u201ccan\u2019t make money\u201d unless they attract \u201cbillions\u201d of assets under management, McNeil said. He suspected \u201cmost\u201d would not and would therefore close in the \u201cmedium term\u201d.\n\nWisdomTree and Invesco have reacted by cutting fees by over 60 per cent on European-listed bitcoin exchange traded products.\n\nFees on the $325mn WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin ETP will fall from 0.95 per cent to 0.35 per cent, while fees on the $137mn Invesco Physical Bitcoin ETP will drop from 0.99 per cent to 0.39 per cent.\n\nBoth changes were announced within days of each other and will come into effect before the end of the month.\n\nInvesco\u2019s US product will waive its fees for six months or when it reaches $5bn, at which point it will charge 0.39 per cent \u2014 the same as the newly announced price on its European product.\n\nWisdomTree Europe head Alexis Marinof said the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US had \u201ccaptured a lot of attention in Europe\u201d.\n\nMany investors \u201caren\u2019t aware\u201d that they have been able to access the same exposure through physically backed ETPs since 2019, Marinof said.\n\n\u201cThe launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US is helping the crypto market to evolve as the asset class continues to stake a claim for a place in client portfolios,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Europe virtually all digital assets exchange traded products are structured as exchange traded notes, rather than funds. Investors in ETNs own a debt security, while ETF shareholders owns a portion of a fund\u2019s underlying assets.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings\n\nUS-based ETF specialist VanEck has said it plans to be \u201cmore aggressive\u201d in marketing its crypto products in Europe following the SEC decision.\n\nMartijn Rozemuller, chief executive of VanEck\u2019s European business, said that as well as boosting investor interest in cryptocurrency, the SEC\u2019s decision had \u201cprobably helped\u201d VanEck\u2019s brand in Europe due to the media coverage of its bitcoin ETF.\n\nUS-listed products may be more liquid and therefore attract European investors, said 7IM senior investment manager Peter Sleep. This is because it is a bigger market and is not spread across multiple exchanges like in Europe, he says.\n\nSpreads, tax and custody arrangements are also important considerations, said McNeil.\n\n*Ignites Europe is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

        "title": "Bitcoin has gone mainstream. For crypto, that's controversial. - Marketplace",
        "content": "It\u2019s been almost two weeks since several investment products tied to bitcoin started trading on old-school financial markets.\n\nThese exchange-traded funds have made it easier for everyday investors to place bets on the cryptocurrency market, like they would buy and sell stocks on Wall Street.\n\nIn the days since federal regulators finally gave the green light, investors have poured nearly $2 billion into the new bitcoin funds. But probably not the crypto purists, says Joel Khalili, who reports on the industry for Wired.\n\nMarketplace\u2019s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Khalili about crypto early adopters, who, he says, are quite happy to stay on the fringes of the financial system.\n\nThe following is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nJoel Khalili: It harkens back to the underlying ideology of bitcoin, that it would be a technology that underpinned a payment network whereby people would store their own wealth and transact directly with one another, essentially cutting these large Wall Street intermediaries out of the picture. And the reality is that the ETFs are just not that, they\u2019re kind of the opposite. They\u2019re a vehicle exclusively for financial speculation. They\u2019re managed by a host of kind of the \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of Wall Street, these large financial institutions. Users don\u2019t hold the underlying bitcoin themselves, they\u2019re kind of investing in a representation. You can\u2019t use ETF shares as a means of peer-to-peer payment, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nMeghan McCarty Carino: So, investing in ETFs is not direct ownership of a cryptocurrency, but that kind of ownership is kind of a core principle for this group.\n\nKhalili: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s one of the reasons why crypto ideologues like the idea of bitcoin ETFs, partly because they see it as a kind of source of new legitimacy for bitcoin and they hope that it will legitimize the asset in the eyes of large, institutional investors. They also see it as something that will kind of unlock this pent-up demand for bitcoin among people who have typically been unwilling to deal with the hassles, the frictions, the perils of storing crypto themselves. So, on one hand, bitcoiners are excited about the arrival of bitcoin ETFs, but they won\u2019t touch them themselves, because as you say, what ETF investors aren\u2019t doing is buying bitcoin directly, they\u2019re buying a representation. There\u2019s a saying among bitcoiners: \u201cNot your keys, not your coins.\u201d And that means effectively that unless you keep bitcoin in a self-managed wallet, it\u2019s not really under your control. That is the case with the ETFs. A third-party custodian has control of the underlying bitcoin.\n\nMcCarty Carino: Can you explain some of the hassles and frictions of buying and storing bitcoin directly?\n\nKhalili: One issue is that some people have tended to prefer not to do business with crypto exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini or offshore exchanges like FTX, which is a name familiar to everyone that ended fairly poorly. So, purchasing crypto directly still involves transacting with a crypto exchange, where you take dollars and they will, in return, give you a cryptocurrency, and then you can choose if you\u2019d like to take the cryptocurrency off the exchange and keep them in a wallet of your own. But it\u2019s that piece where most of the friction lies. The reality with cryptocurrency is that there is no room for error. So, I can take the cryptocurrency and put it in my own wallet. But if I lose access to that wallet, if I forget my password, if I haven\u2019t correctly recorded what\u2019s known as a seed phrase, which is a 12-word sequence of words that will allow you to recover access to a wallet. If you forget any of those pieces and you lose access, then your crypto is gone. It\u2019s into the ether. It\u2019s unrecoverable. So, it\u2019s that piece, that\u2019s where the peril really lies in terms of people participating in what\u2019s known as self-custody. That\u2019s the term that bitcoiners would use.\n\nMcCarty Carino: So, who is excited about this?\n\nKhalili: It\u2019s a funny one. Bitcoiners believe that the greater awareness surrounding the asset among regular people can only be a good thing in the long term. One person put it to me, they think that it\u2019ll have a kind of mosquito bite effect. It\u2019s a bit of a crude turn of phrase, but effectively infecting people with bitcoin fever, right? So they\u2019re kind of excited about this prospect that bitcoin is going to be effectively passing into the hands of a much broader range of people, and a much broader range of investors are coming to the space, and potentially, a lot more cash in terms of dollar value will be entering the bitcoin system and potentially driving up the price. But then on the other hand, none of that means that they\u2019ll be buying ETFs themselves, for the kinds of reasons we\u2019ve discussed.\n\nMcCarty Carino: If we do see this kind of sustained flood of mainstream investment into crypto, could that sort of stabilize this ecosystem?\n\nKhalili: Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s one theory. I\u2019m not a market analyst, but the analysts that I spoke to generally do believe that the arrival of ETFs and the arrival of capital from these kind of large institutional investment houses into the asset class will kind of result in an upward trend in demand. Perhaps that will have a stabilizing effect. But on the other hand, something analysts predicted was that there was a lot of hype in the lead-up to ETF approval around what it might do to the bitcoin price. There were a lot of posts flying around on Twitter peppered with rocket ship emojis, and there were predictions that ETFs would suddenly drive bitcoin to new all-time highs. And the reality \u2013 and this is something that analysts had predicted \u2013 is that the preapproval hype kind of drove up the price, but then the approval itself led to a dip. People bought the rumor, so to speak, and then sold the news.\n\nMcCarty Carino: This moment comes after a tough couple years in crypto. Things seem to have been kind of on the upswing lately, but how would you define this moment in, in crypto after the last few years?\n\nKhalili: People within the industry have a sense of optimism in the wake of the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, which is the collapsed crypto exchange I referred to earlier. There is a sense that there\u2019s an opportunity for crypto to start fresh now. Whether that\u2019s borne out in reality is another question, but there\u2019s a sense of optimism and part of it is surrounding the approval of these ETFs. And I can\u2019t understate how much this was something that members of crypto circles latched on to as something to celebrate. It was the talk of the virtual town for months in the lead-up. So, you know, there is a sense of optimism in crypto circles that the industry can move on from the trauma that was caused by the collapse of FTX and the series of other companies that fell in, in around the same time frame in 2022.\n\nMore on this\n\nIn my conversation with Joel Khalili, we talked about some of the big philosophical tensions with crypto going mainstream, but there are also practical considerations.\n\nOne of the perceived benefits of bitcoin is real-time, around-the-clock availability. The blockchain stays online 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. But stock exchanges and investment firms are more of a 9-to-5 kind of crowd.\n\nSo, that first weekend after ETFs hit the scene, bitcoin\u2019s value fell more than $1,000 after markets closed. As The Wall Street Journal noted, \u201cthose who owned it directly or via a crypto broker were able to keep trading, as bitcoin runs 24/7. Those who held a bitcoin ETF could only watch and wait for Wall Street to open.\u201d"

        "content": "Crypto skeptics aren't changing their tune just because they can now buy bitcoin exposure through an exchange traded fund, according to a Deutsche Bank survey. Since the launch of the ETFs on Jan. 11, bitcoin has fallen about 20% to roughly $39,000, according to FactSet. So far, institutions have been slow to adopt the new funds in portfolios and retail investors aren't entirely convinced they need to, London-based Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure said in a note Tuesday. The bank polled 2,000 consumers across the U.S., U.K. and Europe after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the ETFs earlier this month. It found that more than a third of respondents believe bitcoin will fall below $20,000 by the end of this year. Furthermore, more than half of participants indicated they believe a \"major cryptocurrency\" will collapse entirely in the next two years. Looking at bitcoin specifically, Deutsche said 39% of survey participants think it will stick around in the coming years, while 42% anticipate it will disappear. \"The survey's results clearly indicate a lack of understanding of cryptocurrencies, as two-thirds of consumers possess minimal or no understanding of these digital assets,\" Laboure said. She added that the negative sentiment could be tied to past events, including the collapse of FTX in 2022 as well the SEC's lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, two of the biggest exchanges in the world. The price of bitcoin rallied in the second half of last year, largely on market expectations that the U.S. would approve its first spot bitcoin ETFs this year, bringing the asset class legitimacy as well as an easy, convenient way for investors to add it to their holdings. Despite bitcoin's January sell-off, the crypto asset still has potential tailwinds in coming months, including an upcoming SEC decision on spot ether ETFs in May and the Bitcoin halving expected in April, Laboure wrote. \"The crypto world is gradually moving towards greater institutionalization as traditional financial players (tradFi) enter the market,\" Laboure said. \"Overall, the evolving ETF landscape and participations of institutional players are helping crypto mature into a more established asset class.\" \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

As it turned out, though, there was still some institutional doubt remaining, and not every major player is in agreement about BTC\u2019s prospects, either as an investment choice or for any other purpose, as revealed when customers with Vanguard discovered that the firm had opted not to provide access to those hugely hyped-up new spot ETFs.\n\nIn fact, not only did Vanguard choose not to offer the new BTC products, but it then made the decision to stop offering BTC futures ETFs, which had previously been available on its platform. The upshot being, then, that while other firms were setting about promoting BTC as a necessary component in an up-to-date portfolio, Vanguard was going out of its way to make sure its customers were shepherded well clear of anything blockchain Blockchain Blockchain comprises a digital network of blocks with a comprehensive ledger of transactions made in a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or other altcoins.One of the signature features of blockchain is that it is maintained across more than one computer.

And, as BTC is sometimes directly advocated for as digital gold, just this month, BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink stated that bitcoin is \u201cno different than what gold represented over thousands of years. It is an asset class that protects you.\u201d Then there is consistency in Vanguard\u2019s approach, regardless of whether the assets under consideration happen to be physical metals or entries on a digital ledger.\n\n\"It is an asset class that protects you.\" - Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock on #Bitcoinpic.twitter.com/jO1YAj99ju \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) January 12, 2024\n\nWe can also find evidence of this consistency if we look back to 2020, when Vanguard took a reserved, wait-and-see approach towards ANT (active non-transparent) ETFs, while other firms were, by contrast, keen to include the new products. Notably, State Street took a similar approach to Vanguard, sitting back when others were enthusiastic, and the same is true now when it comes to crypto, as State Street has chosen, for the moment, not to offer spot BTC ETFs.\n\nAll in all then, it would be an unusual shift in approach if Vanguard had chosen to rush into a spot BTC ETF, and it fits comfortably with the Vanguard brand for the firm to visibly step away from crypto when others are riding in on a wave of hype.\n\nThe Impact on Bitcoin\n\nWhen it comes to whether Vanguard might change its approach to crypto, considering the company\u2019s long-term stance, not just towards BTC but also on similar assets, a significant shift appears improbable at this time.\n\nIf such a change were ever to occur, it might require deeper and more long-term mainstream adoption of BTC, although even then, the digital currency might still remain outside the firm\u2019s investment boundaries. However, considering the possibility of increased bitcoin adoption raises another question, which is whether rejection from Vanguard, despite a regulatory greenlight from the SEC, might exercise a drag on Bitcoin\u2019s movement towards greater acceptance.\n\nThat sounds initially plausible, but at the same time, the opposite may be true, as Vanguard\u2019s decision appears to have created even more headlines and debate focused on Bitcoin, thereby pushing the asset further into mainstream awareness. Or as Lubka put it: \u201cIt doesn't matter for BTC, if anything it's free publicity. As long as you can still buy it at other brokers, people have all the on-ramps they need.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin Drops Below $40,000 As Investors Cash Out of GBTC\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has continued its downward trajectory over the past week, dropping below the $40,000 mark for the first time in over two weeks. According to CoinMarketCap, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $39,847, having shed nearly 3.44% of its value in the past 24 hours, and 6.40% over last week.\n\nThe latest price dip comes just days after the much-anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. These investment vehicles, which allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly purchasing the cryptocurrency, were seen as a major milestone for the digital asset industry.\n\nHowever, instead of triggering a surge in demand, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs appears to have led to a sell-off. Analysts believe that investors are cashing out of ETFs, particularly Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust, which recently converted to a spot BTC ETF. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust previously traded like a closed-end investment vehicle, making it difficult for investors to redeem their shares. Following the conversion, investors have been quick to cash out, leading to a significant outflow of Bitcoin from the fund. This, in turn, has put downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe broader cryptocurrency market is also feeling the heat, with altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) both experiencing notable declines. ETH is down more than 4.45% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $2,330, while SOL declined by 6.09% in a day, currently priced at $84.80.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Reach $100,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There's no doubt that the cryptocurrency asset class has been one of the best-performing in recent times. Just take a look at Bitcoin (BTC -4.79%), whose price has absolutely skyrocketed over the past decade.\n\nEven in 2023, the world's most valuable digital asset soared 154%, a gain that crushes the overall stock market. However, Bitcoin remains 38% off its all time high.\n\nThe bulls aren't deterred; they are encouraged by the momentum. They have their sights set on $100,000 per coin. Can Bitcoin rise 130% from today's levels to reach this major milestone?\n\nA favorable setup\n\nBitcoin has been in the news a lot lately. That's because the digital asset achieved something that has long been overdue. And this is the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nEarlier this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission finally allowed these financial products to come to market. And perhaps Bitcoin's gain in 2023 was due to the anticipation from the investment community about ETFs being approved. Many are considering this a monumental event in Bitcoin's history, finally making this a legitimate financial asset in the eyes of the government and Wall Street.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs now make it cheap and incredibly easy to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements. Investors don't have to open a separate brokerage account with a cryptocurrency exchange or worry about self-custody issues anymore. Bitcoin bulls are hoping that the ETFs will introduce a new wave of capital to the asset, which could drive up the price over time.\n\nBesides a regulatory stamp of approval, there's another event that should propel Bitcoin to a higher price. Set to happen this April, the blockchain network will undergo what's known as a halving. This is when the Bitcoin rewards that miners receive to approve transactions and secure the blockchain get cut in half. It happens roughly every four years, and it has historically created a bullish environment for Bitcoin.\n\nJust look at the last time this happened. In May 2020, Bitcoin had its last halving event. The cryptocurrency soared in the two months before. And in the 18 months following the halving. Bitcoin skyrocketed 661% to eventually reach its all-time high of nearly 69,000 in November 2021.\n\nShould something similar play out this time around, the digital asset could reach a new peak price 12 to 18 months following the upcoming halving. Maybe the $100,000 mark is the new achievement to be had.\n\nSolving a problem\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in Bitcoin's short-term price action, but investors should take the time to understand what makes this cryptocurrency really special.\n\nBitcoin supporters have incredibly strong views about this digital asset because of the problem that it solves. By being a decentralized and global peer-to-beer payments network that isn't controlled by any central authority, Bitcoin is basically trying to disrupt the Federal Reserve and current monetary system. Some people argue that central bankers have caused more harm than good by constantly manipulating interest rates to solve inflationary and economic issues that they seem to not have any grasp over.\n\nPlus, consider that the U.S. government currently has $34 trillion in debt, a figure that has surged over the past four decades. This doesn't even include underfunded liabilities like Social Security and Medicare. The thinking is that the government will have no choice but to continue printing money going forward, thus making the debt burden even more insurmountable.\n\nThis troubled monetary situation seems unsustainable. Bitcoin's properties, mainly the fact that it has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, coupled with it not being controlled by anybody, makes it an attractive asset to own in one's portfolio.\n\nWhile near-term price movements are hard to predict, there is a chance that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 in a short period of time. However, investors should only buy this asset if they believe in its long-term potential, with the intention of holding it for the next decade. With that time horizon in mind, the price could eventually be much higher than $100,000."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission has linked a SIM swapping attack to its account breach on X earlier this month, which led to the creation of a fake post announcing approval of Bitcoin ETFs that caused the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to spike. In an update on Monday, the SEC says an \u201cunauthorized party obtained control of the SEC cell phone number associated with the account in an apparent \u2018SIM swap\u2019 attack.\u201d\n\nA SIM-swapping attack occurs when a bad actor obtains a victim\u2019s phone number through techniques like social engineering. That allows the attacker to intercept calls and texts intended for the victim, including two-factor authentication codes, which they can then use to sign in to their victim\u2019s accounts.\n\nIn the SEC\u2019s case, a bad actor reset the password for its X account after gaining control of the phone number linked to it. While the SEC says multifactor authentication was previously enabled on the agency\u2019s X account, it was \u201cdisabled by X Support, at the staff\u2019s request, in July 2023 due to issues accessing the account.\u201d The SEC only reenabled MFA after it realized its account was compromised on January 9th, and says it has MFA active on all of its other social media accounts that have the option."

        "title": "Missed Out on Bitcoin Mining Stocks? 2 Crypto Stocks to Buy Right Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "One of the easiest investment plays of 2023 was buying Bitcoin (BTC -4.79%) mining stocks. All they seemed to do was go up, with popular mining stocks like Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA -7.46%), Riot Platforms (RIOT -6.82%), and CleanSpark (CLSK -7.42%) all up more than 400% by the end of 2023.\n\nBut it could be an entirely different story in 2024. Due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving, only a handful of Bitcoin mining companies are likely to be profitable for the year, and that could lead to a massive shakeout in the industry. So, with that in mind, here are two crypto stocks to buy instead.\n\nCoinbase Global\n\nFirst up is Coinbase Global (COIN -7.17%), which continues to be a favorite of crypto investors. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest was consistently bullish on Coinbase throughout 2023 -- and for good reason. Coinbase remains the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, with a business model that is easy to understand for investors.\n\nCoinbase also remains one of the best indirect ways to get exposure to Bitcoin. Among publicly traded companies, Coinbase is the sixth-largest holder of Bitcoin in the world, with 9,181 bitcoins worth nearly $400 million on its balance sheet. Moreover, Bitcoin accounts for approximately one-third of all trading on the Coinbase platform. Generally speaking, upward momentum for Bitcoin also results in higher trading volume for other cryptos as well, so Coinbase could get a nice overall boost if investors return to the crypto market in 2024.\n\nThe big question, of course, is what the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) mean for the future of Coinbase. At year end, Ark Invest was selling off Coinbase stock, and some took that as a signal that it was time to get out of Coinbase. After all, if people were going to be buying Bitcoin indirectly via ETFs instead of directly via a crypto exchange, that would likely mean a direct hit to Coinbase's bottom line.\n\nBut if you take a closer look at the structure of the Bitcoin ETFs, Coinbase is designated as a custodian for 8 out of 11 of them. In other words, Coinbase is going to be holding onto a lot of Wall Street's Bitcoin in its digital vaults. In a best-case scenario, new custodial and service fees will help to patch over any loss in Bitcoin trading volume on its platform.\n\nMicroStrategy\n\nNext up is MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.06%), which continues to be the single-best Bitcoin proxy stock. If you take a quick look at how much Bitcoin that MicroStrategy is holding on its balance sheet, it's easy to see why. MicroStrategy now holds 189,150 Bitcoins worth nearly $8 billion at today's prices. For those of you keeping score at home, that's approximately 1% of the world's total Bitcoin supply.\n\nAs in the case of Coinbase, there's some debate about what the new Bitcoin ETFs will mean for MicroStrategy. Presumably, the company will lose some of its allure as a Bitcoin proxy stock. In just the first 48 hours after the new Bitcoin ETFs went live, the stock lost 20% of its value.\n\nHowever, some of that appears to be an overreaction by the market. Investment giant Vanguard Group, for example, has said that it won't be making the new Bitcoin ETFs available for its client base. Instead, it will be investing heavily in MicroStrategy as a more efficient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin. That might sound counterintuitive at first until you consider that MicroStrategy's vast Bitcoin holdings are worth more than the company itself!\n\nWhat is the best way to get exposure to Bitcoin?\n\nNow is the time to get your Bitcoin exposure right, especially with the narrative around Bitcoin shifting. With that in mind, there are a variety of different ways to get access to Bitcoin. You can buy Bitcoin mining stocks. You can buy Bitcoin proxy stocks such as MicroStrategy. You can buy the new Bitcoin ETFs. Or you can buy Bitcoin directly via Coinbase.\n\nLooking ahead, the next big catalyst to keep an eye on will be the Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April. Between now and then could be a fantastic opportunity to find crypto stocks such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy that are most likely to benefit from any long-term appreciation in the price of Bitcoin."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has struggled since spot ETFs launched in the US earlier this month, having now given up practically all price gains made since the start of December.\n\nBitcoin was on its way to retesting $40,000 early Monday morning after sinking almost 5% over the past five days.\n\nBTC almost hit $49,000 as ETFs backed by the cryptocurrency opened trade on Jan. 11 \u2014 which converts to a near-20% retracement since that point. BTC is still up 80% over the past year.\n\nBlackRock, Fidelity and Bitwise and six other issuers have been accumulating bitcoin on behalf of ETF shareholders over that time, with the former first to reach $1 billion in assets under management last week. Fidelity\u2019s fund quickly followed.\n\nGrayscale meanwhile has seen $2.8 billion in bitcoin flow out from its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), with its comparatively high fees believed to blame.\n\nPreviously, GBTC was a closed-ended fund through which shares could not be redeemed for bitcoin. The firm won a key SEC court battle late last year, setting GBTC to be converted into an open-ended spot ETF along with all the others.\n\nThat meant capital potentially locked up for years could finally be pulled and reallocated without selling GBTC shares (while its NAV discount has now all but dried up). Bitcoin\u2019s sagging price could be related to GBTC outflows and subsequent sales, although the exact impact is difficult to know for certain.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin at $31K as court formalizes Grayscale win over SEC\n\nGBTC first launched in 2015 and its head start means GBTC is by far the biggest ETF by assets under management, even after the billions in outflows, with $23.55 billion in the fund as of Friday\u2019s close.\n\nOverall, spot bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen about $1.15 billion in net flows over their six trading sessions.\n\nThe latest figures shared by Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas show that spot ETFs without counting GBTC hold 95,300 BTC ($3.87 billion) \u2014 less than half a percent of the circulating supply.\n\nGBTC meanwhile holds almost seven times that amount. Altogether, US spot ETFs account for 3.3% of the supply, about one third of the bitcoin sitting with crypto exchange hot wallets, per CryptoQuant data.\n\nWhile bitcoin has floundered over the past few weeks, markets appear to have gravitated towards ether (ETH) in anticipation over its own suite of spot ETF applications.\n\nRead more: After spot bitcoin ETF approval, eyes shift to ether fund decision\n\nETH is up nearly 1.5% over the year to date, after gaining as much as 11%. Other major cryptocurrencies including solana (SOL) and XRP have meanwhile dropped 20% and 16% while BNB is about flat.\n\nThe sudden attention paid to ether even knocked its 20-day correlation with bitcoin into rare negative territory for the first time in almost three years.\n\nStill, practically the entire crypto market is in the red today and looks primed for consolidation, especially considering the health of the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq so far this year.\n\nThe bitcoin halving sometime in April is the next anticipated potential catalyst for crypto volatility.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Someone even hacked the SEC\u2019s account on the X social media platform to break the news early! But that enthusiasm hasn\u2019t translated to a rise in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nThe Financial Times reports that bitcoin prices are down 15% since Jan. 10, the day the SEC gave its blessing for ETFs, which enable lay investors to jump in and out of commodities more easily than if they had to figure out how to buy them directly. The price is now below $40,000 for the first time since early December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of the reason for the decline is because Grayscale, the trust that had planned to pioneer bitcoin ETFs, is now losing business to lower-priced competitors. Grayscale charges customers 1.5% of their invested assets; a similar BlackRock ETF charges 0.12%. The Wall Street Journal reports that Grayscale has seen $2.8 billion in outflows over the past couple of weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough many people remain interested in bitcoin, very few people own very much of it.

        "content": "FTX sold 22 million shares from Grayscale's bitcoin fund, worth $900 million, Coindesk reported.\n\nThat accounts for a large chunk of the $2 billion in outflows the fund saw after its conversion to an ETF.\n\nThe exodus comes as Grayscale's ETF fees stand well above those of competitors.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FTX bankruptcy estate is responsible for a massive portion of the outflows from Grayscale's bitcoin fund since its conversion to an ETF earlier this month, according to Coindesk.\n\nThe failed crypto firm sold 22 million shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, worth $900 million, zeroing out its holdings in the fund, CoinDesk reported, citing anonymous sources and related data.\n\nThis figure is part of a larger wave of outflows from GBTC, amounting to over $2 billion in shares sold since the investment vehicle became an exchange traded fund this month. Though Grayscale's was the first to start trading, it's seen higher outflows, which the report says can partly be attributed to the selling by FTX.\n\nPrior to its conversion to an ETF on the approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 11, the $27 billion trust was a closed-end fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's only been a few days since GBTC launched as the world's largest spot Bitcoin ETF,\" John Hoffman, managing director of sales and distribution at Grayscale, told Business Insider in a statement. \"GBTC has been dominating trading volume, has already solidified its role as a true capital markets tool for risk transfer in Bitcoin, and has had the best performance of all spot Bitcoin ETFs since its launch. Broadly speaking, large capital markets ETFs are used in a variety of investing strategies, and we anticipate GBTC's diverse shareholder base will continue to deploy strategies that impact inflows and outflows.\"\n\nA fee war had been heating up even before the SEC gave the green light to the spot ETFs, with Grayscale's competitors in the space charging fees of 0.2%-0.9%. GBTC charges a 1.5% fee.\n\nAlthough many hoped the ETFs' approval would boost bitcoin's price, the token has slumped alongside GBTC shares, with the two falling 13.69% and 12.68%, respectively, since January 11.\n\nPrior to the SEC's approval, Standard Chartered said the ETFs could send the price of bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This assumes that between 437,000 and 1.32mn new bitcoins will be held in spot US ETFs by end-2024,\" Head of FX Research Geoff Kendrick wrote, estimating that inflows this year alone could be $50 billion-$100 billion.\n\nThis story has been updated to include a comment from Grayscale."

        "title": "Bitcoin devs can undo 21M supply cap but can't force changes \u2014 Analyst - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin developers can theoretically remove the 21-million-Bitcoin (BTC) supply limit from the source code, but miners are unlikely to accept such a change, according to one analyst.\n\nThe 21-million hard limit of Bitcoin is one of the fundamental principles of the Bitcoin network, which is designed to provide scarcity \u2014 the gap between limited resources and unlimited wants.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 21-million supply limit is written in the open source code by anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto and is publicly available on GitHub, though it is not explicitly stated in the code.\n\nThe limit can be found by searching the \u201cvalidation.cpp\u201d file of the code and getting to the part of the code called \u201cGetBlockSubsidy.\u201d The code mentions that miners\u2019 subsidy is \u201ccut in half every 210,000 blocks, which will occur approximately every 4 years.\u201d The code implies that the miners\u2019 reward will eventually fall to zero from the initial subsidy of 50 BTC as a result of 33 Bitcoin halvings, which are programmed to occur every four years.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 21 million supply cap is implicitly mentioned in the source code. Source: GitHub\n\nLike most other codes, Bitcoin\u2019s source code can be modified, meaning the 21-million limit is theoretically changeable. However, such a change will have to be accepted by miners to be effective, according to Josef T\u011btek, a Bitcoin analyst at the hardware wallet firm Trezor.\n\n\u201cDevs can potentially introduce anything they like, but they cannot force the changes on anyone,\u201d T\u011btek said, adding:\n\n\u201cThe main say in what gets accepted have the node runners \u2014 people around the world that run Bitcoin full nodes.\u201d\n\nThe analyst cited a related historical precedent involving the \u201cBlocksize War\u201d in 2017, where some developers, miners and exchanges wanted to increase the size of Bitcoin\u2019s block from the original size of 1 megabyte.\n\n\u201cThe node runners rejected such change, as it would lead to greater centralization of Bitcoin,\u201d T\u011btek stated. According to estimations from the website Buy Bitcoin Worldwide, there are likely more than 1 million unique individuals mining BTC.\n\nSome commenters in the Bitcoin community echoed similar sentiments on the cryptocurrency forum Bitcointalk, with many expressing confidence that miners will not support the removal of Bitcoin\u2019s 21-million supply cap.\n\nRelated: JPMorgan CEO\u2019s dig on Bitcoin and Satoshi spark BTC hodl rumors on Reddit\n\n\u201cNetwork participants will not run that code and it will have to go to a hard fork that almost nobody would support,\u201d Bitcointalk user Kakmakr wrote. They added:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is not like fiat currency, you cannot simply switch on the money printers and increase the supply... You need consensus from the participants in that network.\u201d\n\nThe comments came in response to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon doubting the finality of the 21-million Bitcoin supply maximum and slamming BTC for alleged use cases like \u201csex trafficking, tax avoidance, Anti-Money Laundering\u201d in a CNBC interview on Jan. 17.\n\nDimon\u2019s hostile stance on Bitcoin didn\u2019t prevent JPMorgan from getting involved in crypto. On Dec. 29, JPMorgan Securities was named as one of the authorized participants for BlackRock\u2019s exchange-traded fund tracking Bitcoin.\n\nMagazine: 10 best long reads about crypto in 2023"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has fallen more than 10% since the Securities and Exchange Commission's approval for spot bitcoin ETFs. One company that is exposed to the ups and downs of the crypto market is Coinbase (COIN).\n\nOwen Lau, Executive Director at Oppenheimer, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the state of bitcoin and the impacts it can have over financial institutions, investors, and the crypto market itself.\n\nWhen asked about the how the price of bitcoin impacts Coinbase, Lau states: \"I would say this is one of the most important factors for now. The other important factor is they are going on a lawsuit with the SEC. So there's still a regulatory overhang. We still don't have clear regulations in the United States right now, even though there are more clarity outside of the United States. So I would call out bitcoin price, the SEC lawsuit and also I think the overall health of the industry are all important factors for Coinbase. \"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Bitcoin extending declines, now trading near $39,000. The optimism over spot Bitcoin ETFs evaporating. And the declines are also hitting crypto-related stocks, including Coinbase. Joining us now is Owen Lowe, Oppenheimer Executive Director and Senior Analyst. Owen, it's good to see you. So some of your colleagues, Owen, making headlines today. They're getting kind of pessimistic, skeptical on Coinbase. And their worry here, as they're watching Bitcoin, they watch these Bitcoin spot ETFs, Owen, maybe a kind of sell-the-news event. Do you share that caution here, Owen?\n\nOWEN LAU: So first of all, thank you for having me. I think in the near term the stock could be volatile because, think about that, if you go back to Coinbase, the stock was up 400% in 2023. And Bitcoin price was also up a lot and there was a sell-the-news event happening after the spot Bitcoin ETF approval. I do think that in the near term there may be some downward momentum on Bitcoin until the next catalyst. So I would say near-term you probably see the stock to be pretty volatile for Coinbase.\n\nStory continues\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Owen, is the Bitcoin price the most important factor for Coinbase's stock price?\n\nOWEN LAU: I would say this is one of the most important factors for now. The other important factor is they are going on a lawsuit with the SEC, so there is still a regulatory overhang. We still don't have a clear regulations in the United States right now, even though there are more clarity outside of the United States. So I would call out Bitcoin price, the SEC lawsuit, and also the, I think, the overall health of the industry are all important factors for Coinbase.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And Owen, I'm also interested when we talk about Coinbase, the business, and you look at non-trading revenue, Owen. What percentage of that is now the total? And how do you see that sort of evolving from here? Because obviously, they've put a lot of emphasis and priority in diversifying the business, right?\n\nOWEN LAU: Yeah, at the end of the third quarter, I would say around 50%, half of the revenue, came from non-trading. And those revenue came from interest income and also blockchain income, which is the revenue they got from the USDC stablecoin. They have a revenue-sharing agreement with Circle.\n\nAnd then the other smaller revenue items are the staking revenue and also custody revenue. So you're right that Coinbase has been making a lot of effort to diversify away from just trading. So that's why Bitcoin is important, but not the-- I wouldn't say it's like only one Bitcoin-- like only Bitcoin is the, like, predominant factor.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: And then, when we look at the Bitcoin ETFs as well, right? There was a lot of debate ahead of time as to whether this is going to be a boon or neutral, or even negative for Coinbase. So now that the introduction has come and gone, what do you think?\n\nOWEN LAU: So when we look at the fourth quarter trading volume. So when we bake in a lot of the optimism of Bitcoin, spot Bitcoin ETF approval, there are two key things that I think not many people talk about. Number one, Bitcoin price went up a lot. And Coinbase January revenue base part on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe second part was about higher trading volume. So what that means is this Bitcoin ETF can bring in new investors, it support higher prices, it also support higher trading volume. That actually benefit Coinbase longer term. So to me, I think it's a net positive for Coinbase longer term because it bring in new investors."

This massive divestment comes in the aftermath of the recent approval granted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, a prominent cryptocurrency analytics platform, Grayscale's Bitcoin holdings have diminished by approximately 52,227 BTC, equivalent to $2.14 billion, since the SEC greenlit spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month. Grayscale currently holds 566,973 BTC, valued at $23.21 billion. In comparison, iShares (BlackRock) boasts 33,431 BTC ($1.37 billion), Fidelity holds 24,857 BTC ($1.02 billion) and Bitwise holds 10,152 BTC ($415.6 million).\n\nStrategic move?\n\nThis strategic move by Grayscale is noteworthy, given the recent wave of approvals granted by the SEC for various spot Bitcoin ETFs. Notable financial players securing approval include ARK Invest, BlackRock , VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise and Valkyrie. Additionally, Grayscale Investments received the green light to convert its $28 billion Bitcoin trust into the GBTC spot ETF, signifying a significant shift in the investment landscape.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is abuzz with speculation regarding Grayscale's decision to offload a substantial portion of its Bitcoin holdings. Analysts suggest that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs may have prompted Grayscale to relocate its assets strategically, capitalizing on the increased institutional interest in the cryptocurrency market."

        "content": "While much has been made of spot bitcoin ETF trading volumes and the net inflow of fresh capital after they were approved and began trading earlier this month, the lion\u2019s share of buying and selling has been spread over a select few of those instruments.\n\nFranklin Templeton's spot bitcoin ETF has, so far, not been part of that elite group of products offered by BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, the three of which have accounted for about 90% of total trading volume. But the Wall Street firm, which was founded in 1947, remains confident that its spot bitcoin ETF product will become popular among financial advisors and investors.\n\n\"It\u2019s just a matter of time \u2026 as education moves forward about how these assets complement and help deliver potentially better long-term solutions alongside of other assets in their portfolio,\" Franklin Templeton Head of Digital Assets Roger Bayston told The Block. \"That\u2019s something that takes time.\"\n\nFranklin Templeton's core business is partnering with financial advisors and wealth platforms to provide solutions, products and services they can deliver to their clients, said Bayston, who believes his firm will emerge as a \"digital asset provider of choice\" as the investment community becomes more familiar with spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\"You have a brand new product that has never existed before. These platforms are doing their fiduciary responsibilities to filter through those providers and find differentiations that end up making sure that their clients have the best long-term results \u2026 that\u2019s the process that is occurring right now,\" Bayston said.\n\nAs of Monday, total trading volume for spot bitcoin ETFs registered above $14 billion, according to data posted to X by Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Franklin Templeton had accounted for $101 million in trading volume, his data also showed.

        "content": "JPMorgan analysts downgraded Coinbase to underweight on Tuesday.\n\nThe stock was previously neutral. Analysts said that while they see Coinbase as the \u201cdominant US exchange in the crypto ecosystem,\u201d they\u2019re concerned that the catalyst which pushed bitcoin to highs not seen in nearly two years won\u2019t last.\n\nThe \u201ccatalyst in bitcoin ETFs that has pushed the ecosystem out of its winter will disappoint market participants.\u201d\n\nCoinShares data Monday showed outflows of $2.2 billion from just Grayscale\u2019s bitcoin ETF, with multiple media reports claiming that sales of GBTC from the FTX estate led to nearly $1 billion worth of the total sum.\n\nThe downgrade, however, didn\u2019t impact the price target of $80. Coinbase (COIN) currently trades around $122 at time of publication. The stock is up nearly 129% in the past year, though it\u2019s dropped 28% in the past month alone.\n\nThe price target now reflects the analyst views on the stock\u2019s \u201cnormalized earnings\u201d rather than their \u201cprevious discounted cash flow approach.\u201d Analysts switched their approaches due to the overall crypto market capitalization. The approach allows them to compare Coinbase\u2019s trading volume to the industry\u2019s market cap.\n\nRead more: As bitcoin ETFs continue fight for assets, here\u2019s where they all stand\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that analysts have voiced concern about the bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cWe have benchmarked bitcoin ETFs to the Gold ETF GLD when it launched to similar market enthusiasm in 2004. Despite the enthusiasm, GLD raised $3.5 [billion] in its first year after launch.\u201d\n\nAnalysts led by Kenneth Worthington found the first week net flows of $1.2 billion to be \u201cdisappointing.\u201d\n\nThe Grayscale outflows have now put the overall aggregate net sales below GLD, they noted further.\n\nOutside of bitcoin ETFs, the court battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Coinbase poses a few potential risks, though analysts don\u2019t believe that these risks could impact operations in the near-term.\n\nHowever, if Coinbase isn\u2019t granted a motion to dismiss then it could face a longer legal path against the SEC, and that would also raise the risk that the SEC could win and force Coinbase to stop offering services such as its Wallet or staking.\n\nRead more: Coinbase, SEC set for courtroom face-off tomorrow\n\nThe SEC has alleged that both services violate securities laws. Coinbase and the SEC attended a hearing last week to put forth arguments both for and against the motion to dismiss.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news for Coinbase, the analysts note that the exchange is a beneficiary of \u201cgreater revenue opportunities\u201d and could even see \u201chigher trading commission potential\u201d and ecosystem engagement.\n\nOutside of the focus on bitcoin ETFs, JPMorgan noted that ethereum staking is on the rise, which could benefit the stock.\n\n\u201cWe believe Coinbase\u2019s earnings power is up significantly \u2014 largely driven by the bitcoin ETF news which is supporting digital asset levels elsewhere,\u201d they wrote.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin has plunged below the critical threshold of $40,000, marking a significant downturn in the cryptocurrency\u2019s value.\n\nBitcoin was trading at $39,640 as of press time, down 18% from its peak of $49,000 earlier in January.\n\nThe decline to around $40,000, Bitcoin\u2019s lowest level since mid-December of the previous year, has been driven by a sustained sell-off amid a series of macroeconomic and market-specific factors.\n\nDollar headwinds\n\nA key contributor to Bitcoin\u2019s recent woes is the unexpectedly robust U.S. economic data, which has led to a tempered outlook for rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThis situation has bolstered the U.S. bond yields and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), creating substantial headwinds for cryptocurrencies at large.\n\nThe U.S. interest rate futures market is still pricing in a near 50% chance of a 25-basis point rate cut in March, despite recent data and Federal Reserve policymakers suggesting otherwise. This dynamic poses potential macroeconomic challenges for Bitcoin.\n\nThe approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has also played a key role in the volatility. While these ETFs initially drew significant capital inflows, they also triggered a \u201csell-the-news\u201d reaction, contributing to the bearish momentum.\n\nGBTC outflows\n\nNotably, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced substantial outflows, with 52,800 BTC sold since its conversion to a spot ETF, reflecting both a shift towards new investment products and profit-taking activities.\n\nAccording to recent reports, FTX has sold $1 billion worth of GBTC shares since it was converted to an ETF, making up a significant portion of the total outflows. The defunct exchange has sold-off almost the entirety of its holdings as of Jan. 22, which could lead to a reduction in the recent recent sell pressure.\n\nDespite the heavy sell-off, the nine newly launched ETFs have accumulated more Bitcoin than Grayscale has sold over the same period, as their assets under management hit $4.1 billion within six days of trading.\n\nThe \u201cNewborn Nine\u201d had purchased 95,000 BTC as of Jan. 20, led by BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s ETFs \u2014 the two make up over 50% of the collective $4.1 billion in assets under management.\n\nCryptoSlate research revealed that the selling pressure was further compounded by short-term holders and traders selling their positions after the ETFs were approved \u2014 confirming a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d event. Additionally, whales have been securing profits on their holdings after 12 months of gains."

        "title": "Home Renovations with Bitcoin - Redfin Blog",
        "content": "In an era defined by digital innovation and the rise of cryptocurrencies, the use of Bitcoin extends far beyond the realm of traditional finance. Homeowners and design enthusiasts now turn to Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized and borderless nature to fund their home improvement projects.\n\nThis article explores the innovative ways Bitcoin is reshaping the world of home renovation, providing a glimpse into the future where Bitcoin meets interior design and construction. Whether you\u2019re contemplating adding a home feature or a comprehensive overhaul of your living space, the possibilities with Bitcoin are endless.\n\nThree ways to use Bitcoin for home renovation projects\n\n1. Find companies that accept Bitcoin\n\nThe use of Bitcoin in home renovations has become remarkably feasible and convenient, thanks to its surging popularity and widespread acceptance across industries. Builders, like Naples Luxury Builders servicing homes in Naples, for example, recognize the growing demand for cryptocurrency transactions. They readily accept Bitcoin as a payment method for their services. Also, major retailers like The Home Depot have adapted to this evolving trend, now accepting Bitcoin as payment through their Flexa\u2019s checkout systems.\n\n2. Use a crypto-backed loan\n\nCrypto-backed loans, like SALT, are on the rise, letting individuals leverage their cryptocurrency assets for personal or business financial needs. Financing home renovation projects using Bitcoin has become prominent among homeowners with these types of loans.\n\n3. Convert your Bitcoin to traditional currency\n\nThere are various cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms available that convert Bitcoin to cash. These platforms are a great option if desired home renovation companies don\u2019t accept Bitcoin as payment.\n\nHave questions about the housing market? We're here to help. Contact a Redfin agent What to consider when using Bitcoin for home renovations\n\nWhen using Bitcoin for home renovation projects, there are several crucial considerations to bear in mind. Firstly, the volatility of Bitcoin\u2019s value can significantly impact the budget. Monitoring the cryptocurrency market and potentially converting Bitcoin to a stable fiat currency when rates are favorable, is essential. Next, ensure that the contractors and service providers are willing and able to accept Bitcoin payments, as not all may be familiar with this currency. Legal and tax implications also play a vital role, as reporting requirements and tax laws regarding cryptocurrencies vary by region.\n\nAdvantages of using Bitcoin for home renovations\n\nUsing Bitcoin for home renovations can be beneficial for homeowners and contractors alike. From lower fees to secure payments, here are a few benefits.\n\nReduced transaction fees\n\nBitcoin transactions typically have lower fees than traditional financial institutions, especially international payments. This can result in cost savings when transferring funds to contractors or suppliers.\n\nFast and secure payments\n\nBitcoin transactions can be processed quickly, often within minutes, regardless of the recipient\u2019s location. Blockchain technology provides high security and transparency, reducing the risk of fraud or disputes.\n\nPrivacy\n\nWhile Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger, they are pseudonymous and do not require the disclosure of personal information. This can enhance privacy and security for both homeowners and contractors.\n\nDisadvantages of using Bitcoin for home renovations\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to understand the disadvantages of using Bitcoin for home improvement. Regulatory uncertainties and price volatility are just a few challenges homeowners may face.\n\nPrice volatility\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value is highly volatile, which means its purchasing power can change significantly over a short period. This can make budgeting and cost estimation for a renovation project challenging.\n\nRegulatory uncertainty\n\nCryptocurrency regulations vary by country and region, and they are still evolving. Homeowners must navigate potentially complex legal and tax implications for using Bitcoin for renovations.\n\nLimited adoption\n\nWhile Bitcoin acceptance is growing, it is only universally accepted by some contractors, suppliers, or service providers. Finding professionals who are comfortable with Bitcoin payments can be a hurdle.\n\nUsing Bitcoin for home renovations: Bottom line\n\nBitcoin offers new ways to finance and transact in home renovation, from direct payments to crypto-backed loans. While its volatility, legal aspects, and limited adoption are concerns, its benefits, like lower fees, speed, and privacy, make it attractive for home renovations. As the use of Bitcoin continues to grow, it\u2019s changing the way we think about and finance home renovations and improvement projects.\n\nRedfin does not provide legal, tax or financial advice.

        "content": "What Is Bitcoin? Everything You Need to Know in 2024\n\nThe Bitcoin network launched in 2009, promising a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Largely unknown at the time, Bitcoin has since changed the way many of us perceive money, offering a decentralized alternative to traditional assets.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll answer the question, \u201cWhat is Bitcoin?\u201d as well as how Bitcoin works and ways to buy and use BTC in March 2024.\n\nKey Takeaways Bitcoin\u2019s supply is limited to 21 million bitcoins. By comparison, fiat currencies like the USD grow in supply, decreasing their value.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain serves as an immutable record of transactions. By contrast, traditional finance requires banks and financial institutions to track transactions accurately.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value comes in part from its security. The Bitcoin network uses proof of work as both an incentive to keep the blockchain going and a disincentive for bad actors due to the cost involved with proof of work.\n\nUnderstanding the Basics of Bitcoin\n\n\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have a storied past dating as far back as the late 1980s and 1990s, including early efforts like eCash and BitGold. Borrowing from and improving upon existing ideas while adding innovations of its own, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to achieve escape velocity.\n\nA cryptocurrency is a digital asset independent of governments or financial institutions, although companies like Ripple manage some cryptocurrencies.\n\nUnlike gold or silver, both of which have a long history as money, Bitcoin is completely digital, an electronic currency created by software. This allowed its anonymous creator(s) to build features similar to gold, namely scarcity and divisibility. Unlike gold, however, Bitcoin can be divided infinitely. Bitcoin\u2019s supply is capped at 21 million bitcoins, with the smallest denomination being a satoshi (one 100 millionth of a bitcoin).\n\nWhat\u2019s a Bitcoin? A single Bitcoin is one of a 21 million capped supply of bitcoins, the cryptocurrency of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin (singular and capitalized) often refers to the network, whereas bitcoin (lowercase) is used when referring to the currency itself. Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning that balance tracking and transactions occur on a distributed network of computers around the world. The code itself is also decentralized, requiring approval by the worldwide network for code changes. In traditional financial systems, we have to trust banks for reconciliation and to ensure no double spending occurs. If you pay out more than you have in your bank account, the result is often reversed transactions or overdraft fees \u2013 as determined by the bank. By contrast, the Bitcoin network prevents double-spending by design. More on that in a bit. As a decentralized peer-to-peer payment network, Bitcoin also offers censorship resistance, meaning you can spend your bitcoins for whatever you wish, and no one can close your Bitcoin address due to political beliefs. By comparison, banks and payment services can decline transactions or close accounts without warning. In short, Bitcoin promises financial sovereignty. But how did it start, who made it, and why?\n\nThe Origin and Development of Bitcoin\n\n\n\nIn October 2008, a person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper, a now-famous document that explained the purpose of the project and how it would work. By January of 2009, Satoshi mined the first Bitcoin block, the Genesis Block.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain functions as a ledger, a record of transactions and balances.\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, transactions are grouped into blocks for validation. Think of a block as a box holding the details of who sent what to whom. These blocks each link to a parent block using a cryptographic hash. Simply put, a hash value (a long string of letters and numbers) from the previous block becomes part of the data in the following block, thereby forming a chain. More on how that works in a bit.\n\nBlocks are just data, including transactions. The Genesis Block contained both a transaction and a message. Satoshi sent 50 bitcoins to an unrecoverable address.\n\nIn addition, the first block held a message:\n\n\u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\u201d\n\nThe message was a headline from The Times, a well-read British newspaper. Satoshi\u2019s message serves as a timestamp for the Genesis Block but may also indicate why Satoshi built Bitcoin. The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) had left the financial system teetering on the precipice of the abyss. People were frightened, and many were angry that the actions of governments and banks threatened to destroy modern life.\n\nMany believe Bitcoin was created as an alternative to not just financial institutions, as mentioned in the whitepaper, but as an alternative to traditional currencies entirely.\n\nThe Genesis Block started it all, with each subsequent block linking to it, making an unbreakable chain. Today, over 820,000 Bitcoin blocks have been mined.\n\nThe Mysterious Creator \u2013 Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\nLong after Bitcoin\u2019s creation and Genesis Block, we still don\u2019t know Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s real identity. Satoshi might have been an individual or perhaps a group of people.\n\nSatoshi first mentioned the Bitcoin whitepaper on a cryptography mailing list (metzdowd.com), publishing the PDF on Bitcoin.org, where it still resides at the same URL today. This led many to speculate that Satoshi was a cryptography or coding expert.\n\nAn archived user profile on a peer-to-peer discussion site suggests Satoshi was a 37-year-old male residing in Japan. However, an email address used by Satoshi ([email protected]) suggests a US-based IP address. GMX used different domain extensions for email addresses, depending on location.\n\nAdding to the confusion, Satoshi sometimes used British English, while switching to American English in others. For many speculating about Satoshi\u2019s identity, this inconsistency points to a group rather than an individual. Others suggest the variation may have been an intentional part of operational security for the project.\n\nOver the years, several potential \u201cSatoshis\u201d have emerged in speculative discussions, including:\n\nHal Finney\n\nNick Szabo\n\nDorian Nakamoto\n\nCraig Wright\n\nAdam Back\n\nElon Musk\n\nYonatan Sompolinsky\n\nTo date, the question remains unanswered in the minds of many in the Bitcoin community. Of note, Craig Wright claims to be Satoshi and describes a competing cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) as the original Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBitcoin wallet addresses presumed to belong to Satoshi currently hold about 1.1 million bitcoins, or nearly $50 billion, assuming the current Bitcoin value of $44,000.\n\nHow Bitcoin Works: The Technology Behind the Currency\n\n\n\nWe briefly covered the Bitcoin blockchain earlier. To understand how Bitcoin works, it\u2019s helpful to trace a transaction and how transactions are recorded.\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to send 0.2 bitcoin (about $9,000 at current BTC price) to someone to buy a used car. Here\u2019s how the transaction flow works on the Bitcoin network.\n\nInitiate the transaction. You open your Bitcoin wallet (an app) and choose the seller\u2019s address.\n\nYou open your Bitcoin wallet (an app) and choose the seller\u2019s address. Broadcast the transaction. Your wallet communicates with the network, broadcasting the new transaction to all nodes. The nodes then check the ledger to be sure you have enough bitcoin to cover the transaction and its associated fees.\n\nYour wallet communicates with the network, broadcasting the new transaction to all nodes. The nodes then check the ledger to be sure you have enough bitcoin to cover the transaction and its associated fees. Miners discover a block. Miners are always working to mine a new block to hold transactions. In the interim, the transaction is stored in the mempool, a digital waiting area for transactions awaiting a block. More on how mining works later.\n\nMiners are always working to mine a new block to hold transactions. In the interim, the transaction is stored in the mempool, a digital waiting area for transactions awaiting a block. More on how mining works later. The winning miner includes the transaction in the block. Once a new block is mined, the transaction is included in the block, and subsequent blocks become \u201cconfirmations.\u201d Typically, for high-value transactions, six or more confirmations are considered irreversible. Your wallet address is debited 0.2 bitcoin (plus fees), and the seller\u2019s is credited 0.2 bitcoin.\n\nAt the end of the transaction, the seller receives 0.2 bitcoin in an unspent transaction output (UTXO).\n\nThe miner earned a block reward consisting of a fixed amount of bitcoin plus the network fees associated with the block\u2019s transactions.\n\nBitcoin mining is cost-intensive, making it impractical to reverse a transaction. Because the blocks are linked, and a new block is added every ten minutes on average, a rogue miner who wanted to change a transaction would have to re-mine all the blocks after a given transaction and do so faster than the network mines new blocks.\n\nThe Role of Blockchain in Bitcoin\n\nIn the previous section, we looked at a basic transaction on the Bitcoin network. All transactions are stored in blocks and these blocks are then linked together in sequence, forming a chain.\n\nExcept for the Genesis Block, each block in the Bitcoin blockchain has a parent block. Bitcoin uses SHA-256 encryption to link the blocks together. SHA-256 turns data into a hash value.\n\nHere\u2019s an example.\n\nInput Output Hash To be, or not to be, that is the question. d899dd565cdb385855a5099025cdc90b7eee44fa504d0c1d17ce781c49529a9a\n\nBut if the input changes even slightly, the hash value changes dramatically.\n\nInput Output Hash To be, or not to be, that is the question! 89415f39f627327c5a21e5da0e73ae1f6b1813f1993986622595401c38ec8430\n\nEach new block contains the hash value of the parent block. If a transaction is changed in block 80,000, it will change block 80,000\u2019s hash value and the hash value of every subsequent block. The network would discard this revised version of the chain as invalid because the subsequent blocks are not linked.\n\nThe hash keeps the chain linked, and the Bitcoin network chooses the longest chain.\n\nBlockchain technology allows a constant ledger without a trusted third party. In traditional finance, a bank decides if you have enough money to complete a transaction \u2014 and may even decide if you can complete the transaction at all. Generally, the Bitcoin blockchain is permissionless, tracking wallet balances and immortalizing successful transactions on the blockchain.\n\nWhile a miner can choose not to include a transaction in a block, as recently happened with a US-sanctioned Bitcoin address, these transactions will be picked up by another miner in a subsequent block.\n\nThe nearly immutable Bitcoin blockchain, combined with Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity and the belief that others will accept Bitcoin as payment, are what give Bitcoin its value.\n\nEncryption and Security Measures\n\nBitcoin uses encryption in several ways. We discussed how an encryption hash links one block to the next. Hashing is one-way encryption, meaning the source data for the hash can\u2019t be derived from the hash.\n\nEncryption and hashing are also used in Bitcoin wallets. First, let\u2019s look at how Bitcoin wallets work.\n\nBitcoin wallets generate and store two types of keys.\n\nTypes of Wallet Keys\n\nPrivate keys control the assets at a given Bitcoin address on the blockchain. Anyone who has the private keys can control the assets, spending the bitcoins or sending them to another wallet. Private keys are encrypted. The Bitcoin Core wallet, for example, uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256-CBC) to protect the private keys. Most wallets generate the private keys using a seed phrase, a series of 12 to 24 words.\n\ncontrol the assets at a given Bitcoin address on the blockchain. Anyone who has the private keys can control the assets, spending the bitcoins or sending them to another wallet. Private keys are encrypted. The Bitcoin Core wallet, for example, uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256-CBC) to protect the private keys. Most wallets generate the private keys using a seed phrase, a series of 12 to 24 words. Public keys are generated by the private keys using one-way encryption. Public keys then generate Bitcoin wallet addresses. These are the addresses visible in transactions using a block explorer such as blockchain.com. Public keys can also be used for digital signatures, a way to show you have the private key for an address.\n\nWhile a public key is derived from a private key, the private key can\u2019t be derived from the public key or its Bitcoin addresses.\n\nBelow, find an example of the first Bitcoin address, which was owned by Satoshi. The wallet address holds the first Bitcoin transaction (50 bitcoins) as well as several subsequent transactions.\n\nThe private key for this address is only known to Satoshi, however.\n\nAs you can see, Bitcoin transactions are not encrypted, but the technology used to complete a transaction requires encryption. Anyone can see a Bitcoin transaction on a block explorer. What remains unknown, in most cases, is the address\u2019s owner.\n\nPseudonymous vs. Anonymous People often assume the crypto is anonymous, meaning no one can identify you. That\u2019s not accurate. Crypto blockchains use addresses that act as your identity in transactions. This makes crypto pseudonymous rather than anonymous. Often, the real owner of a crypto address can be revealed through their transactions. Encryption appears again in Bitcoin mining. To use a simple explanation, Bitcoin mining consists of guessing a correct hash (the SHA-256 encrypted hexadecimal value) of the block header before other miners. The first miner to guess the hash \u2014 plus a randomly generated nonce (number only used once) \u2014 gets to add the next block and reap the rewards.\n\nBitcoin Mining Explained\n\n\n\nThe Bitcoin network provides a financial incentive to validate transactions called mining rewards. But the process of mining for rewards paid in bitcoins is also what keeps the network secure.\n\nWe discussed some of the basic structure of the network earlier.\n\nSomeone initiates a Bitcoin transaction. The wallet broadcasts the transaction to the Bitcoin network.\n\nWhile people all over the world are transacting, Bitcoin miners are searching for a block to store those transactions. They\u2019re working to find a new block.\n\nBitcoin mining requires computing power. Essentially, it\u2019s a process of guessing \u2014 a lot. Bitcoin network is trying to guess the correct hash and nonce to find the next block.\n\nAs shown below, the current hash rate (number of guesses) is over 542 trillion hashes per second.\n\nAs the hash rate increases with more computing power added to the network, the difficulty of solving for the nonce also increases. The Bitcoin network automatically adjusts the difficulty every 2,016 blocks (about two weeks). The goal is to average one block every ten minutes based on the hash rate.\n\nWhen a miner finds a block, that miner earns block rewards consisting of newly created bitcoins and the fees for transactions in the block.\n\nThe Process of Mining Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of finding new blocks in which to store transactions. The process is called proof of work (PoW).\n\nIn proof-of-work consensus mining, the miners must show they have done work, expending energy (and money) to find a block. The idea comes from Hashcash, a spam-prevention concept pioneered in 1997 by Adam Back, one of the people some think might be Satoshi.\n\nThe PoW process makes it expensive to mine a new block, which in turn makes it extremely difficult to change the transaction in a block that\u2019s been mined. As more blocks are added to the blockchain, the odds approach zero, even if a group of miners controls a significant amount of the network\u2019s hash rate.\n\nWe covered the basic process earlier.\n\nMiners work to solve a nonce.\n\nA nonce is a random number used once, which is appended to a block header\u2019s hash.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol creates a hash value of the block header, including:\n\nBitcoin version number\n\nA hash of the previous block\n\nMerkle root (a hash of all the transaction hashes in the block)\n\nA nonce\n\nThe only variable miners can change when hashing (guessing) is the nonce. Miners then create hashes of the block header combined with the nonce.\n\nOne recent block (block height 822,140) had a nonce of 3,175,838,978. The winning miner (ViaBTC) earned 7.98439474 BTC, including 6.25 newly minted bitcoins.\n\nWhat is BTC?\n\nThe trading symbol BTC refers to bitcoin.\n\nOnce a miner finds a block, it broadcasts the nonce, which other nodes can verify with a single hash. The block is then added to the chain, and the process begins again. This is proof-of-work consensus (agreement across nodes).\n\nSolo Mining and Mining Pools In the early days of Bitcoin mining, solo miners used CPUs to crank out hashes and guess nonces. As the network grew, the processing power needed to be competitive also increased. Today, Bitcoin miners use Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASICs) that are designed to hash at much higher rates. Solo Mining is unlikely to net a reward in today\u2019s competitive mining world, so mining pools have become a popular alternative. As the name suggests, individual miners contribute their hashing power to a pool of miners. Collectively, the pool has a better chance of earning a reward. When it does, the mining reward is split proportionately according to the hashing power contributed.\n\nAcquiring Bitcoin: Buying and Trading\n\n\n\nBecause mining has become so competitive, the easiest way to acquire bitcoin is to buy on an exchange like Coinbase or MEXC. Both platforms offer easy onboarding for new investors and both also offer a way to move your bitcoins off the platform to a self-custody wallet.\n\nFor example, to get started with MEXC, just follow these simple steps.\n\nVisit MEXC to open a new account. To open an account with MEXC simply head over to the official website and tap on \u2018Sign Up\u2019. Register your account. Users can register their accounts via their mobile phone numbers or email addresses. Deposit funds in your MEXC account. Depositing funds into your MEXC account is straightforward. Users can buy BTC via bank cards, P2P/OTC trading or via Blockchain transfer. Buy Bitcoin. Tap on the \u2018Buy Crypto\u2019 button to view the available methods in your location. For a more streamlined experience some expert traders purchase stablecoins like Tether and then use that to buy BTC via the spot market.\n\nBuy BTC on MEXC\n\nChoosing a Bitcoin Wallet\n\n\n\nAfter you purchase Bitcoin, you may want to move your holdings off the trading platform for safekeeping.\n\nEarlier, we discussed the role of crypto wallets to safeguard your Bitcoin. A wallet holds the private keys that control Bitcoin on the network.\n\nYou can choose from hot wallets or cold wallets.\n\nHot wallets generate and store the private keys on a device that\u2019s connected to the internet. A hot wallet is an app that runs on your phone or computer. For example, Electrum is a popular Bitcoin-only wallet. However, you could also choose a multi-chain wallet that supports Bitcoin, such as Coinbase Wallet. Most hot wallets are free to use.\n\ngenerate and store the private keys on a device that\u2019s connected to the internet. A hot wallet is an app that runs on your phone or computer. For example, Electrum is a popular Bitcoin-only wallet. However, you could also choose a multi-chain wallet that supports Bitcoin, such as Coinbase Wallet. Most hot wallets are free to use. Cold wallets generate and store your private keys offline. A cold wallet is usually a hardware device that can communicate with your computer or mobile device but which does not connect to the internet. Trezor is a popular choice because the device firmware and software suite are both open-source. Coders from around the world have reviewed the code to verify what\u2019s happening under the hood.\n\nHot wallets offer more convenience because you can send Bitcoin in just a few clicks. However, hardware wallets offer more security because nothing leaves your wallet until you confirm the transaction on your hardware device.\n\nConsider your risk level relative to the cost. Hardware wallets are an investment. Many popular Bitcoin hardware wallets range in price from $55 to $200 or more. Top choices like Trezor can pair with hot wallets such as Electrum. This allows you to keep smaller amounts in a hot wallet for convenience while safeguarding larger balances.\n\nUtilizing Bitcoin: From Payments to Investments\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s whitepaper describes Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Over the years, however, Bitcoin has become much more than just a payment system. It\u2019s become a hedge against inflation, a store of value, and an investment for many.\n\nBitcoin for purchases: Leading merchants like Newegg, Overstock, and even Microsoft now accept Bitcoin for some purchases.\n\nLeading merchants like Newegg, Overstock, and even Microsoft now accept Bitcoin for some purchases.

Some HR and freelance apps like Deel also offer the option of Bitcoin payments for work performed. Bitcoin as an investment: You can buy Bitcoin using an exchange, as described earlier, but Bitcoin spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are on the horizon in the US, and Bitcoin spot ETFs are already available in Europe and Canada.\n\nBitcoin in Everyday Transactions\n\nWhile more merchants accept Bitcoin as a payment method, we haven\u2019t reached universal acceptance yet. Traditional currencies still dominate.\n\nPart of the challenge is volatility. A dollar is always a dollar, but Bitcoin\u2019s value in dollars changes by the minute. If the use of Bitcoin grows, we may be able to expect more retailers willing to accept Bitcoin. In this scenario, the value of Bitcoin should increase due to the limited supply, making it more attractive to vendors.\n\nSpending your Bitcoin comes with some considerations, however. Because Bitcoin is not legal tender in most of the world, spending your Bitcoin can become a taxable event. In effect, you have to account for Bitcoin\u2019s value in your local currency at the time of the transaction. If there\u2019s a gain in value compared to your cost basis, you may have to pay taxes.\n\nCrypto tax software apps can help make accounting easier, but the tax ramifications should be considered before purchasing with Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to consider mining fees. Earlier, we discussed how miners earn the transaction fees for blockers they mine. Those fees can be expensive at times, especially if the network is busy. Mining fees are based on the transaction size in bytes rather than the amount, making Bitcoin a better option for larger transactions because the fees represent a smaller percentage of the transaction.\n\nInnovations like the Lighting Network promise faster transactions and much lower fees by bundling transactions.\n\nInvesting and Speculating with Bitcoin\n\nIn 2011, Bitcoin and the US dollar reached parity. Since then, a dollar is still a dollar (ignoring inflation) and a bitcoin is worth about $44,000.\n\nBitcoin rewarded early investors with staggering returns relative to other investments as well. Between November 2013 and November 2023, Bitcoin produced 3249.016% returns. By comparison, the S&P returned 153.09%. However, many investors think we\u2019re still early in the timeline.\n\nBitcoin can be part of a larger diversified investment portfolio or be used for trading.\n\nInvestment portfolios: You can invest in Bitcoin through trading platforms like MEXC or Coinbase. Because the price of Bitcoin can be volatile, it\u2019s prudent to match your investment to your risk tolerance. The ride gets bumpy.\n\nYou can invest in Bitcoin through trading platforms like MEXC or Coinbase. Because the price of Bitcoin can be volatile, it\u2019s prudent to match your investment to your risk tolerance. The ride gets bumpy. Speculative trading: Bitcoin\u2019s volatility makes it attractive to traders, however. Price changes offer an opportunity to trade the market\u2019s ups and downs rather than buy and hold. Exchanges like Kraken, MEXC, and OKX offer perpetual futures trading in some markets, providing a way to trade with leverage and settle the trade without buying or selling actual bitcoin.\n\nThe Risks and Challenges of Bitcoin\n\n\n\nBitcoin investors who bought at the all-time high of nearly $69,000 are still down significantly in percentage terms. Bitcoin\u2019s volatility brings meaningful risk. Bitcoin is also difficult to value relative to stocks or real estate investments in which you can measure profits or cash flow. This adds to price uncertainty.\n\nHowever, the largest risks facing Bitcoin investors may be regulatory.\n\nIn 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt banned private ownership of gold bullion in the US with the stroke of a pen. It\u2019s not hard to imagine something similar applied to cryptocurrencies that compete with fiat currencies worldwide.\n\nWhile bans remain a possibility, restrictive regulations or legislation are more likely possibilities and could affect the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor example, a recently proposed bill in the US called the \u201cDigital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act\u201d would threaten the ability to transact in cryptocurrencies, according to many experts. If similar laws were passed in other major markets, the value of Bitcoin and other digital assets would likely plummet.\n\nFortunately, the bill is considered unlikely to pass.\n\nRead More: Best Crypto Giveaways\n\nCommon Misconceptions and Myths about Bitcoin\n\n\n\nAs a new technology, cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t yet well understood by the public (or its legislators).\n\nHere are some of the most common misconceptions and myths about Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is a bubble. While Bitcoin has seen tremendous growth in value, relative to the world\u2019s population, Bitcoin\u2019s value is likely still low. By some estimates, less than 3% of the world\u2019s population uses Bitcoin.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has seen tremendous growth in value, relative to the world\u2019s population, Bitcoin\u2019s value is likely still low. By some estimates, less than 3% of the world\u2019s population uses Bitcoin. There are no real-world uses for Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin can be an investment or a store of value, there are many ways to use Bitcoin as a payment method for everyday transactions. And because Bitcoin is an asset, you can also borrow against it to buy real-world goods and services or invest in traditional real-world assets.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin can be an investment or a store of value, there are many ways to use Bitcoin as a payment method for everyday transactions.

More people using and investing in Bitcoin helps Bitcoin hold the top position. Bitcoin uses too much energy. Bitcoin mining uses more energy than some countries, according to estimates. However, large-scale miners have moved to areas where they can access renewable energy or areas where energy is \u201ctrapped\u201d and can\u2019t be transported elsewhere.\n\nBitcoin Regulation and Legal Aspects\n\n\n\nAnother misconception about Bitcoin is it\u2019s an unregulated security and will be banned by regulators like the SEC. While some cryptocurrencies may fit that definition, Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature makes it a commodity, similar to gold or silver, rather than a security.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin trading remains legal in major markets like the US and UK. Many governments treat Bitcoin as property for tax purposes. However, the road ahead could still hold peril. A competing currency shines a light on the falling values of traditional currencies.\n\nProposed legislation like US Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act could change the crypto landscape in years to come. Already, many exchanges and Bitcoin mining pools around the world require KYC (Know Your Customer) identity verification before you can transact.\n\nRegulations and future legislation could make trading in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies more difficult \u2014 or even impossible. To revisit the idea behind Bitcoin, the ability to transact without an intermediary, it\u2019s not too hard to imagine how governments might try to stifle that ability.\n\nEvaluating Bitcoin as an Investment\n\n\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies can bring more risk compared to traditional investments. However, the potential returns can also be much higher.\n\nBitcoin investing is best suited for:\n\nPeople who can accept price volatility.

You can\u2019t charge back a transaction and if you send bitcoins to an incorrect address, it\u2019s likely gone forever.\n\nAlso, consider the following tips to help ensure secure transactions.\n\nUse QR codes.

Beware of scams, phishing, and fake websites. Because cryptocurrency is easy to transfer, crypto holders are common targets for scammers, including phishing attempts to get your recovery phrase or fake websites that look like well-known sites.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin\n\n\n\nBitcoin price predictions are fun, although always speculative. Bitcoin\u2019s future hinges on adoption.\n\nWill more retailers start accepting Bitcoin? Will Bitcoin become a world reserve currency, replacing the dollar? The first situation is bullish for Bitcoin, whereas the second could send prices to the moon and beyond.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility of a decline.\n\nOur own market-based Bitcoin price predictions put the future price as high as $150,000 by 2030, more than a 3x increase compared to today\u2019s price. Others in the industry, including Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity Investments, put the target as high as $1 million to $10 million per bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s primary strength is in its ability to act as a store of value. Today, everyday transactions on the Bitcoin network remain costly, making it better suited to larger transactions. However, the Lightning Network or similar scaling solutions could make Bitcoin more practical for everyday transactions, dropping transaction fees from dollars to a fraction of a penny and eliminating the long wait between blocks.\n\nClosing Thoughts: Is Bitcoin Right for You?\n\n\n\nBitcoin began the crypto revolution in 2009, but it\u2019s still early for this new technology. Many believe that Bitcoin\u2019s best days are still ahead and that a sizeable opportunity still exists.\n\nThe journey ahead comes with risks but without guarantees, much like any investment. However, Bitcoin has outperformed every other asset class since its launch, suggesting it\u2019s not like any other investment.\n\nConsider your risk tolerance carefully before investing, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. But if you decide to invest in cryptocurrency, Bitcoin makes a logical first step. Bitcoin\u2019s security, bolstered by proof of work and its network effect as the largest cryptocurrency, will likely give it advantages over competing cryptocurrencies for years to come.\n\nVisit MEXC\n\nReferences"

        "content": "Bitcoin ecosystem is currently experiencing rapid expansion since the emergence of the Ordinals protocol. To foster further growth, there is a pressing need for a solution that not only enables seamless interactions across Bitcoin, Bitcoin Layer-2s, Ethereum, and Ethereum Layer-2s.\n\nAddressing this need for interoperability, Polyhedra Network introduced the Bitcoin Messaging Protocol powered by zkBridge, the interoperability protocol designed and implemented by Polyhedra Network. This pioneering development expands Bitcoin's functionality, enabling it to interact seamlessly with a range of blockchain networks, both Layer-1s and Layer-2s.\n\n\n\nUsing zkBridge, Bitcoin can now securely transmit its current and historical data, utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, to 20+ networks including Bitcoin Layer-2s, Ethereum, and Ethereum Layer-2s. This interoperability extends to recent Bitcoin innovations such as Ordinals, BRC-20, and Atomicals.

        "title": "Asic examines collapsed bitcoin company Blockchain Global after Guardian investigation - The Guardian",
        "content": "Australia\u2019s corporate regulator will examine details of the collapsed bitcoin company Blockchain Global after a Guardian Australia investigation revealed links between two of its directors and a series of failed crypto investment schemes.\n\nBlockchain Global collapsed in 2021 owing creditors $58m, with the liquidator referring its directors \u2013 Allan Guo, Sam Lee and Ryan Xu \u2013 to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission for potential breaches of the Corporations Act. This included possible breaches of director\u2019s duties, breaches of trust and unreasonable director-related transactions.\n\nAsic initially advised liquidators Pitcher Partners that it did not intend to take action after it received the first report on the company\u2019s activities in March 2022.\n\nBut after a Guardian Australia investigation into the HyperVerse crypto investment scheme, which has links to Lee and Xu, Asic has begun an examination of the liquidator\u2019s report. A final version was filed to Asic in October.\n\nAn Asic spokesperson told Guardian Australia: \u201cAsic confirms that it is assessing reports from the liquidator in relation to BGL.\u201d\n\nGuardian Australia has revealed widespread losses to the HyperVerse investment scheme, which escaped regulator attention in Australia despite being flagged by authorities overseas \u2013 by one as a possible \u201cscam\u201d and another as a \u201csuspected pyramid scheme\u201d.\n\nCourt documents filed in January in the US against Bitcoin Rodney, a senior US promoter of HyperFund and HyperVerse, allege the scheme operated with a network or promoters making \u201cfraudulent promotional presentations\u201d to investors and potential investors. He has been charged with operating and conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.\n\nAn affidavit filed by the US internal revenue service alleges that early investors were \u201cpaid with funds collected from more recent investors\u201d, and the company\u2019s claimed revenue-generating bitcoin mining operations did not exist. There is no mention of Xu or Lee in the court documents filed by authorities in that case.\n\nLee has denied being behind HyperVerse, saying his involvement was limited to technology provision and the funds management side of the organisation. Both Lee and Xu appeared in the HyperVerse global launch event in 2021, alongside a fake chief executive officer called Stephen Reece Lewis. Xu and Lee also both featured prominently in promotional material for the schemes that preceded HyperVerse, known as HyperFund and HyperCapital.\n\nReece Lewis has since been revealed by the Guardian to be the British man Stephen Harrison, who said he was hired for a short period via a talent agent to play a \u201ccorporate presenter\u201d and that he had no role in the actual business.\n\nLee relocated to Dubai in 2021, while the whereabouts of Xu is unknown. Guo is not involved in the Hyper group schemes.\n\nThe US-based crypto analysis firm Chainalysis estimates losses to HyperVerse in 2022 amounted to US$1.3bn (A$1.97bn).\n\nThe move by Asic to examine the Blockchain Global collapse comes as the liquidator also reveals a possible link in the company\u2019s records to the operation of HCash, which was a cryptocurrency linked to the Hyper investment schemes.\n\n\u201cThe liquidators have identified two debt transactions totalling $500,000 in Blockchain Global\u2019s main bank account [linked to HCash]. These transactions both occur on 5 August 2019,\u201d Pitcher Partner\u2019s liquidator Andrew Yeo told Guardian Australia.\n\n\u201cIt is not clear whether the funds were used for this intended purpose.\u201d\n\nRewards that were accumulated through the earlier Hyper schemes were converted to HCash before they could be converted to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Afternoon Update Free daily newsletter Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An application for it to be deregistered was made in May 2023.\n\nCollinstar Capital was owned by Xu until mid 2022, after which it was taken over by Cheng.\n\nAsic documents reveal shares of the company\u2019s 40 founders were transferred from Xu to Cheng for $5.50, while 200,000 noncumulative preference shares were transferred at no cost, with a value of $125,000 listed as unpaid.\n\nCheng did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia.\n\nLee did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia before the publication of a previous article about his involvement in the establishment and operation of HyperFund and HyperVerse. He has previously denied the schemes are a scam.\n\nIn a WhatsApp message after the article was published he alleged it included \u201cmisstatements\u201d about his role in running the Hyper schemes but did not respond when asked what they were. He also claimed that \u201cpeople on the internet continues [sic] to make things up\u201d.\n\nLee has also not responded to questions from Guardian Australia about the liquidators\u2019 findings in relation to Blockchain Global."
