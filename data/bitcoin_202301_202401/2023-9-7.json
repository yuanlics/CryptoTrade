        "title": "Texas paid bitcoin miner more than $31 million to cut energy usage during heat wave - CBS News",
        "content": "As a bitcoin mining enterprise, Riot Platforms runs thousands of computers in the energy-guzzling pursuit of minting digital currency. Recently, however, the company got big bucks from Texas to lower the mining operation's electricity usage.\n\nRiot said on Wednesday that the state's power grid operator paid the company $31.7 million in energy credits in August \u2014 or roughly $22 million more than the value of the bitcoin it mined that month \u2014 to cut its energy consumption during a record-breaking heatwave in the state.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the state's power grid, issues the credits to incentivize companies to reduce activities that might strain the state's already overloaded energy system.\n\n\"The effects of these credits significantly lower Riot's cost to mine bitcoin and are a key element in making Riot one of the lowest cost producers of bitcoin in the industry,\" CEO Jason Les said in a statement.\n\nRiot, which is publicly traded, in 2022 reported a loss of more than $500 million on revenue of $259.2 million. In its most recent quarter, it had a loss of roughly $27 million on revenue of $76.7 million.\n\nTexas' power grid has faced growing demand from consumers and businesses in recent years as climate change leads to more extreme weather. In 2021, residents faced a blackout when a snowstorm knocked out coal and gas facilities, nuclear plants, and wind turbines.\n\nThe strain on the grid persists. On Wednesday, Texas officials declared an emergency as sky-high temperatures again threatened to trigger rolling blackouts across the state. ERCOT asked that residents and business owners conserve energy between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., according to CBS News Texas.\n\n\"Operating reserves are expected to be low this afternoon due to continued high temperatures, high demand, low wind, & declining solar power generation into the afternoon & evening hours,\" the group said in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).\n\nBitcoin mining, in which virtual transactions are verified on a computer network in exchange for a certain amount of bitcoin, is highly energy-intensive. Bitcoin consumes roughly 110 Terawatt Hours per year, or 0.55% of global electricity production \u2014 roughly equivalent to that consumed by Sweden, data from the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance shows.\n\nRiot did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPublic concerns\n\nHeavy energy consumption from bitcoin mining has caused a stir in Texas, with some people expressing anger that their tax dollars are subsidizing energy credits for miners. Residents of Navarro County, Texas, started a petition last year opposing a bitcoin mining facility in their area.\n\n\"This factory-that-produces-nothing will affect every single citizen of Navarro County and MUST BE STOPPED,\" reads the petition, which has amassed nearly 1,200 signatures. \"We do NOT want this enormous burden on our already fragile infrastructure.\"\n\nSome Texas lawmakers have also grown wary of cryptocurrency mining. In April, the state's senate passed a bill that would limit incentives for miners participating in the state's energy grid load-reduction program.\n\nFor now, the credits are a boon for Riot and other bitcoin miners whose profits have dried up during a cryptocurrency market downturn deepened by the collapse of exchange FTX last fall."

        "title": "Texas Paid a Bitcoin Miner $31.7 Million to Use Less Electricity - Texas Monthly",
        "content": "After the deadly statewide power outage in 2021, academics, experts, and politicians floated a lot of blue-sky ideas about how to keep the Texas power grid running in all kinds of weather. Some were practical, such as increasing transmission capacity to use all of the solar and wind energy the state is capable of producing, while others were downright fanciful: what if, Ted Cruz posited, we relied on Bitcoin miners to help save the grid?\n\nTexas is, of course, a fanciful place, and while we\u2019ve yet to substantially scale up transmission, that Bitcoin idea won the support of Governor Greg Abbott\u2014and the Texas Legislature, which passed two mining-friendly bills in the last session\u2014and has gone from a bizarre idea to, essentially, plan A for preventing blackouts. Here\u2019s what the junior senator had to say about it back in 2021: \u201cBecause of the ability of Bitcoin mining to turn on or off instantaneously, if you have a moment where there\u2019s a power shortage in a power crisis, whether it is a freeze or some other natural disaster where power-generation capacity goes down . . . they become excess reserves that can strengthen the grid\u2019s resilience by providing a significant capacity of additional power to be available for critical services if and when it\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nAccording to a press release issued Wednesday from large-scale Bitcoin mining operation Riot, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, a state entity that manages the grid, paid Colorado-based Riot $31.7 million in energy credits to power down its computers during peak demand in August. On the bright side: the grid held, and we didn\u2019t experience rolling blackouts (to say nothing of the sort of huge failure we saw in 2021). On the other hand: that\u2019s $31.7 million handed over to just one Bitcoin miner, which we all pay for through our electric bills. And Riot is but one of several big Bitcoin miners operating in the state\u2014not to mention the smaller operations\u2014though we won\u2019t know how much those companies have been paid until they make announcements of their own. On Wednesday, Riot CEO Jason Les boasted about the company\u2019s \u201cunique power strategy.\u201d During the rest of the month, when Riot was performing its core operation\u2014mining Bitcoin\u2014it created $8.59 million worth of the cryptocurrency.\n\nPopular Videos Previous Next more\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining\u201d obfuscates what\u2019s actually happening here. Bitcoin \u201cmines\u201d are actually math problems that escalate in complexity as more coins enter circulation, and which require immense amounts of computing power to solve. That work takes place in expensively air-conditioned data centers the size of large warehouses. As the equations are solved, new bitcoins are minted, and they become the property of the person or entity whose computers found the solution.\n\nBitcoin mining is a significant driver of energy demand in the state, accounting for as much as two gigawatts of power\u2014or enough to power about 200 million LED lightbulbs. Using large amounts of electricity, and then agreeing to turn off that electricity when the state\u2019s total demand exceeds supply in exchange for millions of ratepayer dollars in payouts, doesn\u2019t seem fair to the rest of us, who just want to keep the lights on and the AC blowing.\n\nRiot operates two Bitcoin-mining facilities: one in Rockdale, between Austin and College Station, and one in Corsicana, between Dallas and Waco. On the one hand, the strategy of paying Bitcoin miners such as Riot to turn off their computers when Texas needs the electricity for other businesses and homes appears to be helping to prevent rolling blackouts. On the other hand, the resulting situation, in which it\u2019s vastly more profitable for Bitcoin miners to turn off their business than to actually operate that business, creates some curious incentives.\n\nAccording to Riot, the company mined 333 bitcoins in August. Bitcoin prices fluctuate. In the past month, its value has ranged from around $25,000 per coin to $30,000 (at press time, a single bitcoin was worth $25,757). At its 2021 peak, a single bitcoin was worth nearly $69,000, more than double today\u2019s price. Because the complexity of the problems that Bitcoin miners must solve keeps increasing, back in 2021 it was less energy-intensive to mine a coin. Now it requires more energy to produce something less valuable.\n\nIn July, when the grid was under less-severe strain, Riot mined 410 bitcoins, worth around $10.5 million, and the company received an additional $7.8 million from ERCOT. When things started to heat up in August, though, and the ERCOT power credits really started flowing, Riot lucked out\u2014it became significantly more lucrative to power down than to mine Bitcoin, and the number it produced dropped by nearly 20 percent. In a traditional situation, that sort of drop in productivity, along with the dip in market value Bitcoin experienced in August, would mean a company in the Bitcoin business was having a bad month. Instead, Riot sent out press releases touting the rewards it received for unplugging its machines for a while. While the press release doesn\u2019t attribute the difference in the number of bitcoins produced to Riot\u2019s participation in ERCOT\u2019s \u201cdemand response\u201d program or the power credits it received, the correlation seems clear: for Riot, Bitcoin in August was literally not worth the energy used to produce it."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF: The quiet 800-pound gorilla in the room is about to roar - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "A Bitcoin ETF will likely be approved in the U.S. by the end of 2023. The general public has no idea this is about to happen. Even crypto natives, dismayed by depressed markets and a decade of rejections by the Securities and Exchange Commission, are somehow brushing off the current state of affairs.\n\nBitcoin exchange-traded funds have been highly sought after since 2013 when the first application was submitted to the SEC and subsequently rejected. Over the past 10 years, the SEC has denied each of the several dozen ensuing proposals, including over 30 just since 2021. There are currently 10 active applications from major institutions. An uninformed observer may expect more of the same rejection, but this would be naive.\n\nTwo substantial developments in the past three months have drastically improved the prospects of an approval. Let\u2019s take a look at these developments and consider whether or not a spot ETF could revitalize Bitcoin and lift crypto out of its bear market.\n\nDevelopment 1: BlackRock\u2018s ETF bid\n\nMomentum kicked off on June 15 this year when BlackRock made waves by unexpectedly submitting a Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink has spoken favorably about Bitcoin since then. Bitcoin \u201chas a differentiating value versus other asset classes, but more importantly, because it\u2019s so international it\u2019s going to transcend any one currency,\u201d Fink said. His change of tune is remarkable as he previously denounced Bitcoin as an \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d back in 2017.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s track record of ETF application approvals is nothing short of superb. The asset management giant has submitted 576 applications and all but one have been approved. Have the Bitcoin ETF tea leaves adjusted, and BlackRock taken note? BlackRock\u2019s 99.8% approval rate suggests so.\n\nSeveral other high-profile institutions including Fidelity and Ark Invest have followed suit with pending applications under review. Their filing dates and decision deadlines are largely identical. There are four deadlines during the review process in which the commission may, and often does, opt for delay and further review.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhether the SEC decision arrives early or not until final deadlines, the caliber of the institutions currently applying and their optimism are signaling one result: approval.\n\nDevelopment 2: Grayscale\u2018s court win\n\nA separate but equally significant development in the direction of ETF approval is the Aug. 29 federal court ruling that the SEC was wrong to deny Grayscale Investments\u2019 filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale previously applied to convert their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. The SEC denied this application, and Grayscale responded with a lawsuit arguing that the decision was incorrect. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sided with Grayscale in its decision stating \u201cIn the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful.\u201d The court also ruled that the SEC\u2019s \u201cdenial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nThe court ordered the SEC to once again review Grayscale\u2019s application, effectively reversing the previous rejection.\n\nWhile the ruling does not equate to automatic approval, it strengthens the odds that approval is on the horizon. The SEC would need to provide strong support for further rejection. This begs the question: If such support exists, would it not have been included in their original rejection?\n\nOdds of approval\n\nWhile the SEC recently delayed all ETF applications on Sept. 1, as most applicants\u2019 first deadline for review was on Sept. 2, the delays were largely expected. The market responded accordingly with Bitcoin dropping about 5% from the delay announcement to around US$25,700 at the time of this writing. Despite the delays, the path to a spot ETF approval is much clearer after Grayscale\u2019s win in court. JPMorgan analysts believe this, as well as former SEC Chair Jay Clayton who says approval is \u201cinevitable.\u201d\n\nIt is reasonable to expect the SEC to approve several or even all of the filings at once. The applications are structured very similarly, and it may be considered unfair to grant any of the applicants a head start. Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest, told Bloomberg: \u201cI think the SEC, if it\u2019s going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once.\u201d Ark Invest has the earliest \u201cfinal deadline\u201d for its filing, which is slated for Jan. 10, 2024.\n\nEric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, believes there is a 75% chance of a spot Bitcoin ETF getting SEC approval this year. He ups the odds to 95% by the end of 2024.\n\nScreen Shot 2023 09 07 at 1.22.09 AM\n\nIf SEC approval is inevitable, how might we expect markets to respond?\n\nWhat crypto markets will do, post-ETF\n\nBitcoin ETFs already exist in the European Union, Canada, Brazil and Dubai. But as the U.S. is the center of world financial markets, including crypto markets, approval by its government would undeniably be a major event.\n\nAn ETF would shuttle new money into Bitcoin. While crypto exchanges such as Coinbase are the primary avenue for entering crypto today, the average American understandably has trust issues with them. KYC (know-your-customer) procedures and having to transfer funds to purchase crypto are also onerous as opposed to simply buying an ETF share. Crypto wallets, private keys and self-custody complicate matters further.\n\nThe institutions applying for a Bitcoin ETF deeply understand these hurdles. They know an ETF is an opportunity for a large segment of the population, who have thus far remained sidelined, to comfortably begin adding crypto exposure to their portfolio.\n\nBitcoin spot ETFs, in contrast to futures ETFs \u2014 which have traded in the U.S. since 2021 \u2014 may be particularly constructive to crypto markets. Spot ETFs, the type that all current applicants are applying for, would require the offering institutions to back the ETF with real Bitcoin. This differs from futures ETFs, which merely enable investors to trade an indexed derivative. In the case of futures ETFs, Bitcoin does not actually change hands. A new buyer of a spot ETF has a genuine positive impact on the price of the underlying asset.\n\nAnother way of thinking about a futures-based ETF is like two people betting on how the price of something will change. It\u2019s more akin to a side bet on what will happen. Their bet has no direct effect on the price of the asset they are betting on.\n\nA Bitcoin spot ETF issuer such as BlackRock or Fidelity must buy bona fide Bitcoin to back the shares of the fund that their customers hold. A Bitcoin spot ETF buy or sell will actually change the price of BTC.\n\nThe new source of fund flows into the space may provide the spark the industry needs to recover from a series of blows in 2022. The news itself will almost certainly cause a rush of buying in the short term. The volatility will breathe new life into the markets which have largely been subdued throughout this summer. The Grayscale decision on Aug. 29 produced a near immediate 6% Bitcoin price increase from US$26,100 to US$27,700. This increase fully re-traced on news of the SEC\u2019s choice to delay all of the outstanding applications on Aug. 31 as the first decision deadline for most filings approached.\n\nIf the ETF is approved, it is possible that market gains will extend longer than only in the short term.\n\nIn the short to medium term, a reflexivity loop may be created whereby:\n\nBitcoin price increases on ETF approval news.\n\n\u2b07\n\nInvestors desire Bitcoin allocation due to price increases.\n\n\u2939 \u2934\n\nInvestors purchase shares in a spot ETF, which drives Bitcoin prices up further.\n\nIn the long term, we will see BlackRock et al shepherding clients to diversify part of their portfolio into Bitcoin. Passive investors will buy and hold for the long term. As Bitcoin\u2019s supply is finite, the price is bound to be driven upward.\n\nGold appreciated eight years in a row after the initial spot Gold ETF was approved back in 2004. For all proclamations of Bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d it would be fitting for Bitcoin\u2019s next upward cycle to similarly commence following ETF approval.\n\nThe world is not paying attention to Bitcoin at the moment. That will change before the year ends."

        "title": "22-year-old who lost $80,000 in crypto: 'I was investing with money I didn't necessarily have' - CNBC",
        "content": "Ethan Nguonly, a 22-year-old software engineer, started investing in the stock market with the help of his parents before he was a teenager. Today, his investment portfolio includes close to $135,000 in retirement and brokerage accounts, plus two houses. But he didn't get there without making what he now calls his biggest financial mistake. Between November 2021 and June 2022, Nguonly says he lost about $80,000 by investing in crypto on margin. His losses include $30,000 of his original investment and an estimated $50,000 in unrealized gains. Investing with margin involves using borrowed funds to purchase an asset. Nguonly says he had already made pretty hefty crypto investments in bitcoin and ethereum of around $40,000, plus a few hundred dollars in altcoins like shiba inu and dogecoin. But as bitcoin's price went on a tear, he decided to buy more \u2014 about $15,000 worth \u2014 on margin. For a moment, Nguonly says he was up about $50,000 as the price of bitcoin reached its all-time high. But at the end of 2021 the crypto market took a turn, and by the summer of 2022 bitcoin's price crashed over 70%. \"I was investing with some money that I didn't necessarily have,\" Nguonly tells CNBC Make It. \"Once the crypto market kind of reversed, my losses were amplified.\"\n\nBuying on margin: Know the risks\n\nInvesting on margin is a sophisticated strategy that can prove lucrative if your investments continue to perform well. But it amplifies your losses if the market takes a dip. When you buy on margin, you're borrowing money from a broker in order to invest more than you otherwise could have. As a result, you can boost your earnings, but are also at risk of losing more if the market goes the other way, as Nguonly experienced. Bitcoin's price crashed so much he faced a margin call, meaning he had to sell a significant portion of his holdings to cover the cost of the loan. To make a profit when buying on margin, your investments have to outperform the cost of the loan itself, which is part of why your losses will be greater if your investments depreciate. This can happen with any kind of security, but particularly volatile assets like cryptocurrency may make you more vulnerable to losses like Nguonly's. Indeed, investing in cryptocurrency in any capacity has always been risky. Even during the run-up to bitcoin's November 2021 all-time peak, the investments remained speculative, volatile and mostly unregulated. While investing is an important factor in building wealth, it always comes with risk. Especially when it comes to crypto, experts recommend only investing what you can afford to lose. It's also important to avoid investing techniques you don't understand, such as options trading or investing on margin. \"Margin accounts can be very risky and they are not appropriate for everyone,\" the Securities and Exchange Commission warns in its guide for investors. There are rules, like minimum deposits and borrowing limits, from the Federal Reserve and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority aimed at ensuring people who open margin accounts know the risks and understand the financial commitment they're making.\n\n'Only invest money you have'"

        "title": "Firms can mark Bitcoin rebounds on their balance sheets in long-awaited accounting change - Fortune",
        "content": "The wonkier corners of Crypto Twitter were buzzing on Wednesday on news that the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a.k.a. FASB, had unanimously passed a measure that will bring a big change to how companies hold crypto on their balance sheets. This has immediate implications for the likes of Bitcoin-buying Block, Tesla, and MicroStrategy\u2014and could potentially lead other large firms to consider adding crypto to their treasuries.\n\nMost people are understandably reluctant to dive into the finer points of corporate accounting, but the big change is not hard to grok. It stems from the fact that, for the longest time, the head bean counters stayed silent on crypto\u2014refusing to provide guidance for how to value it on a balance sheet. This led to Bitcoin being chucked into a category called intangible assets along with things like trademarks and goodwill. In practice, this meant that any company holding crypto had to mark down its value as an \u201cimpairment\u201d if the price dropped\u2014but could not record a gain if the price shot back up.\n\nThanks to this week\u2019s FASB vote, that practice is out the window, and very soon firms will be able to tally a gain whenever their crypto holdings rebound from a price shock. While this has been in the works for many months, the new accounting regime is now official\u2014albeit with a few quirks. Namely, the updated rules apply to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, but not to the synthetic or \u201cwrapped\u201d versions of the currencies that power much of the DeFi landscape. Likewise, stablecoins and NFTs are not included, according to a helpful Bloomberg Tax report on the news.\n\nAll of this is unlikely to inspire most firms to rush out and add crypto to their balance sheets, especially in the current bear market. But the fact there are finally clear accounting rules in the first place is likely to make corporate finance departments less skittish if their company wants to experiment with Bitcoin and Ethereum in one way or another.\n\nMore broadly, the FASB rule change comes at a time when the financial landscape around crypto is maturing rapidly. Other recent changes include Coinbase announcing a crypto lending service for large investors, and firms in the hyper-volatile Bitcoin mining sector learning to employ hedging strategies in order to stabilize revenue.\n\nThese developments mean that, more than ever, the forces of traditional finance are likely to shape the next phase of crypto. For now, though, the crypto industry\u2019s main concern is coming up with a way to rekindle interest in the sector in the first place.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nGenesis Global Capital, which made large loans to the hedge funds Alameda and 3AC, is suing parent company DCG to recover over $600 million in unpaid loans even as the firms negotiate a bankruptcy settlement.

Below is a step-by-step guide to buying Bitcoin cash:\n\nStep 1 \u2013 Create a Bitcoin Cash Wallet\n\nSame as other cryptocurrencies, you have to open a bitcoin cash wallet in order to store the coin safely. There are many Bitcoin cash wallets providers that allow you to hold Bitcoin Cash as it is, usually, a similar wallet to Bitcoin. One of the most recommended wallet for Bitcoin Cash is BTC.com. Software wallets include JAXX and Exodus. For hardware wallets that provide the most secure method to hold cryptocurrencies, you can use Trezor or Ledger.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Find the Best Bitcoin Cash Exchange\n\nAs Bitcoin Cash is one of the most popular and used cryptocurrencies, there are many exchanges that support Bitcoin Cash:\n\nCoinbase \u2013 One of the biggest cryptocurrencies exchanges that provide Bitcoin cash trading with US dollars. In addition, You can store your Bitcoin cash coins in Coinbase platform.\n\nBinance \u2013 Currently, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange by volume allows traders and investors to purchase Bitcoin cash with other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. For those who own Bitcoin or Ethereum, the process is easier as all is needed is to register and open an account at Binance.\n\nFor those that do not own Bitcoin or Ethereum and prefer to trade via Binance as it has a wide selection of cryptocurrencies, we would advise you to acquire Bitcoin or Ethereum through Coinbase.\n\nBitcoin Cash Exchanges\n\nThe next method, if you don\u2019t hold Bitcoin cash, is to go to an exchange and buy it. Some of the major Bitcoin exchanges like CEO.IX, Kraken, and Bittrex have already started trading in Bitcoin cash and are witnessing surging volumes in them. So, all that you need to do is to visit these exchange sites, take a look at demand and supply and the price and go and get them. Though Kraken had begun trading in Bitcoin cash in the last few days, it is only today that they started accepting deposits and withdrawals in Bitcoin cash, which is a sign of the growing use of this cryptocurrency in the recent days.\n\nOnce you have received your Bitcoin cash, either from the exchange or by buying it from the exchange, you can use it any way you want, just like how you would spend any other altcoin for that matter. You could also convert it into Bitcoin again and use the bitcoins as well. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nBut there are a few things to keep in mind though. The addresses are identical for both bitcoin and bitcoin cash and hence, if you reveal one, it means that you automatically reveal the other as well and this is quite risky in terms of security and privacy.\n\nAlso, you reveal your public key and not your private key which would, in turn, mean that you are losing out on a specific layer of security that is inbuilt into the cryptocurrency industry. These are just a couple of things that you need to keep in mind before you start using Bitcoin cash. One of the ideas to overcome this problem would be to move the bitcoin or bitcoin cash to an entirely new address so that you can ensure the safety and security of the other part.\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Bitcoin Cash compare to Bitcoin?\n\nThe start of the Bitcoin cash market has been bright as it started off with a large market cap and it also started with a large price tag. Due to the split, Bitcoin cash is no longer associated in any manner with Bitcoin and has to survive on its own. How it survives will be known in the coming days as we wait for more and more miners to jump into the Bitcoin cash market and begin mining.\n\nJust like any other cryptocurrency, it is very important that Bitcoin cash gets enough processing power (hashrate) from the miners to keep building the blockchain, else it will slowly wither away and die. It is important for the Bitcoin cash industry to build itself a good ecosystem around it so that it would be able to keep those who invest in it satisfies. Those will be important parameters for such instruments to succeed.\n\nBitcoin cash has to develop its own market and show itself to be different and more useful than Bitcoin. So far, the pickup in Bitcoin cash, in the transactions market, has been slow but it is expected to pick up speed and strength in the coming days as more and more traders and investors begin to realize that it is here to stay. One of the major advantages it already has is the fact that anyone who owned Bitcoin on August 1 will automatically get an equal number of Bitcoin cash and with the proliferation of wallets and with exchanges accepting them, bitcoin cash is likely to do well.\n\nAnother major advantage of Bitcoin cash is its larger block limit. This was one of the major drawbacks of the Bitcoin market and this was the reason why the supporters of Bitcoin cash wanted a split in the first place. Now, with the higher limit, they would be able to perform a much larger number of transactions which would help the Bitcoin cash to propel the next stage of this technology.\n\nWhat\u2019s Gonna Happen with Bitcoin Network?\n\nWhat this means for the Bitcoin network is to set up the stage for the growth of technology and also a stance that the technology would keep everyone in mind as it grows. What this split has done is that it has shown the market that the technology is willing to listen to the market and its needs and adapt itself accordingly. Once the Bitcoin cash market begins to thrive, it will also show that this technology split does not necessarily mean one is better than the other or that one has to die to make the other survive but rather that both can survive and help in the growth of the network and the technology.\n\nThis could also result in lower transaction fees for both bitcoin and bitcoin cash which would, in turn, mean that investors and traders are more likely to pick up more bitcoins and bitcoin cash. This reduction in fees can be achieved due to the fact that Bitcoin cash has helped to expand the size of the network which would mean that there is less congestion now.\n\nSuch advantages are likely to drive more and more of Bitcoin\u2019s traders and miners towards Bitcoin cash and this would help this market to thrive, grow technologically and also mature to be an example for other cryptocurrencies. The recent split phenomenon will boost confidence in such instruments which would, in turn, lead to more countries beginning to adopt such technology.\n\nAlready, the Bitcoin market has begun to show its approval as the demand has grown and prices have shot through the $7000 mark as of this writing. This shows that the Bitcoin network is alive and thriving as well, which is likely to help Bitcoin cash achieve the same effect."

This bitcoin miner posted record profit, apparently all due to the heat.\n\nGetting paid to power down. This bitcoin miner posted record profit, apparently all due to the heat.\n\nA Bitcoin mining company with operations in Texas earned a record profit of $31.7 million in energy credits for reducing its power usage during the continuously high temperatures in August.\n\nJason Les, CEO of Riots Platforms, Inc. called August a \"landmark month\" after being paid through the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT's, demand response program.\n\nERCOT, who runs the state's power grid and has come under fire since the electricity failure during 2021's winter freeze, will pay entities, or in this case, miners like Riot who use a lot of power, to cut back during periods of peak demand, and hopefully, ease stress on the grid.\n\nRiot said in a release that it curbed its power usage by more than 95% during those peak periods, \"forgoing revenue from its Bitcoin mining operations to instead provide energy resources to ERCOT.\"\n\n\"The Company's curtailment of operations meaningfully contributed to reducing overall power demand in ERCOT, helping to ensure that consumers did not experience interruptions in service,\" the release said.\n\nTexans were asked to conserve many times last month, but as one energy expert explained it, ERCOT will call on large load carriers that have a contract with them to turn off at strategic times to help with generation.\n\n\"A normal conservation is hey can you turn up your A/C bit, try not to use your dryer, turn off the oven. An EEA2 action is they went and took an action and said, 'Hey, we're going to go and have these loads turn off to free up the grid,\" said David Kinchen, CEO of Energy Ogre.\n\nAs our partners at chron.com point out, Texas had made itself a welcome place for bitcoin miners, so much so that mining accounts for a large chunk of the state's consumption. For example, in 2022, bitcoin projects accounted for 33 gigawatts of energy compared to all Houston households combined using an estimated six gigawatts per year.\n\nCNBC did an even deeper dive into the payout and Riot's operations, noting that Riot has been powering down at its mine an hour north of Austin to help lessen the burden on the grid.\n\nThe boost from ERCOT also helped Riot at a time when it's been facing millions of dollars in losses."

        "content": "Texas paid bitcoin miner Riot \u2013 the most power-intensive bitcoin operation in the country \u2013 $31.7 million during the month of August to conserve energy, a CNBC article reported.\n\nRiot, located in Rockdale, an hour east of Austin, is by no means a successful operation \u2013 CNBC reported that they only made about $8.9 million this month. So they and other failing bitcoin operations are turning to \u201calternative sources of income,\u201d as CNBC puts it \u2013 like the Texas grid operator \u2013 to generate profits.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas relies on large industrial consumers for \u201cdemand response\u201d programs, where they offer credits in exchange for conservation. They rely on average residential customers for the same thing \u2013 just without the compensation. This practice has sparked outrage among Texans who have been repeatedly asked to conserve voluntarily amid triple-digit heat, while actually paying higher electric bills than usual. \u201cThis is a prime example of state officials putting corporate profits over people,\u201d said Public Citizen\u2019s Adrian Shelley. \u201cIt's fundamentally unfair to average Texans, many of whom struggled to pay the monthly bill to keep their homes cool this brutal summer.\u201d\n\nAnd Riot is being paid by those same consumers: A recent New York Times investigation found that 10 bitcoin mining operations in Texas have accounted for ratepayers\u2019 electric bills rising by 5% annually, and five of those have pocketed a combined $60 million since 2020. During the 2021 winter storm, the Bitdeer facility neighboring Riot got an $18 million windfall. The two combined use the same amount of energy as the nearest 300,000 homes.\n\nCurrently the only compensated demand response program available to Austin Energy ratepayers gives customers who install smart thermostats credits toward their electric bills."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Friday morning in Asia to trade above the resistance level of US$26,000, leading a rally across most top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. The exceptions were Cardano and Toncoin, which both posted minor losses. Ether logged moderate gains but remained below US$1,650. U.S. financial services giant JPMorgan Chase & Co. is reportedly exploring a blockchain-based payment and settlement system, raising optimism for more institutional adoption of blockchain. U.S. stock futures traded mixed, after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower on Thursday. Stronger-than-expected jobs data has added to U.S. rate hike concerns.\n\nBitcoin spearheads crypto winners\n\nBitcoin rose 1.62% in the last 24 hours to US$26,179.43 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, turning a weekly loss into a gain of 0.75%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency had been trading between around US$25,500 and US$26,000 since Saturday. It reached an eight-day high of US$26,409.30 early Friday morning.\n\nJPMorgan, the largest bank in the U.S. by asset size, is \u201cin the early stage\u201d of developing a blockchain-based digital deposit token for cross-border payments and settlements. The bank has already laid out most of the underlying infrastructure, but will wait for approval from U.S. regulators before making the token itself, Bloomberg reported Friday.\n\nDeposit tokens are transferable digital assets representing deposit claims against a commercial bank. Token transactions take place on blockchains, making deposits faster and cheaper than traditional methods.\n\n\u201cIt is another sign that large corporations continue to build their blockchain capabilities during this bear market,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to crypto, some traditional players are holding back while others are making strides,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock. PayPal\u2019s announcement that it will launch a stablecoin has started a domino effect of institutional action in crypto, he said.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOnce a large player kicks things off and competitors see that as a desirable/profitable set-up, it won\u2019t be long until other players launch their own solution, if only to stay relevant in an ever-advancing space,\u201d d\u2019Anethan added.\n\nThe market is currently waiting on a decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding another U.S. financial giant \u2014 BlackRock. On June 15, the world\u2019s top asset manager applied for approval to create a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\n\u201cWhile most expect the SEC Blackrock decision to hit the market in October, the news of a potential ETF approval can also come any time,\u201d Thielen said.\n\n\u201cOnce Bitcoin regains some momentum, the rally could have legs and bring prices back above US$30,000,\u201d he added.\n\nElsewhere, Martin Gruenberg, chairman of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), said on Thursday that despite the apparent good health of the U.S. economy, the country\u2019s banking industry \u201ccontinues to face significant downside risks from the effects of inflation, rising market interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty.\u201d\n\nBitcoin prices have historically benefited from uncertainties in the banking system, such as the crisis at Zurich-based lender Credit Suisse in March. The bank\u2019s sudden collapse sent the token\u2019s price from below US$27,000 to over US$28,000 on March 19.\n\nEthereum gained 0.77% to US$1,644.68 over the past 24 hours and edged down 0.07% for the past seven days.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged small gains. Cardano\u2019s ADA and the TON network\u2019s Toncoin were the only tokens that posted losses, dipping 0.14% and 0.70% respectively. But both coins posted gains for the week at 1.07% for ADA and 3.68% for Toncoin.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 1.37% to US$1.05 trillion. Trading volume dropped 11.95% to US$23.81 billion.\n\nStrong US jobs data; China restricts iPhone use for government employees\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading mixed as of 09:40 a.m. in Asia. The three major U.S. indexes also closed mixed on Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite posting a 0.89% loss. All the main Asian indexes were down Thursday morning, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng leading the losses with a 1.34% drop.\n\nInitial jobless claims in the U.S. fell to 216,000 for the week ending Sept. 2, the lowest level since February. That was short of the 234,000 forecast by experts in a Reuters poll.\n\nLast week\u2019s August jobs data pointed to a gradual softening in the U.S. labor market. But Thursday\u2019s jobless report shows \u201cthe labor market is still tight,\u201d Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told Bloomberg. She said the data could influence the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s thinking on interest rates,\n\n\u201cMore moderation in job growth will be needed to keep rate hikes further down the road off the table,\u201d Vanden Houten said.\n\nOn the other side, multiple Federal Reserve officials said on Thursday they thought the U.S. central bank should keep interest rates unchanged at its meeting on Sept. 20. In July, the Fed raised the rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% \u2014 the highest level in the past 22 years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not yet convinced that we\u2019ve extinguished excess inflation. But in today\u2019s complex economic environment, returning inflation to 2 percent will require a carefully calibrated approach\u2014not endless buckets of cold water,\u201d Lorie Logan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said on Thursday.\n\nLogan said that another rate hike pause would be \u201cappropriate\u201d when the Fed meets again later this month.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 95% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, up from 93% on Thursday. It gives a 57.4% chance for another pause in November.\n\nMeanwhile, multiple Chinese government agencies have instructed their staff not to bring iPhones to work amid tensions between Beijing and Washington. The government may also expand restrictions to state-owned enterprises and affiliated organizations.\n\nChina is one of Apple\u2019s largest foreign markets. It accounted for nearly a fifth of the firm\u2019s global revenue in 2022. Apple\u2019s shares closed 2.92% lower on Thursday following the reports.\n\n\u201cThe Nasdaq is sinking as one bad Apple spoils a bunch of mega-cap tech stocks,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst at U.S.-headquartered foreign exchange corporation OANDA, told Fortune on Friday.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s growth story is heavily reliant on China and if the Beijing crackdown intensifies that could pose a big problem to the bunch of other mega-cap tech companies that rely on China,\u201d Moya said.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

Getty Images\n\nOf about 200 people globally who trade bitcoin, just six are billionaires, Henley & Partners found.\n\nMeanwhile, 22 people worldwide have reached billionaire status by trading cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin rallied in the first half of the year but has since dipped.\n\nHundreds of millions of people trade crypto and bitcoin \u2013 but only six have reached billionaire status.\n\nAccording to Henley & Partners' Crypto Wealth Report, some 425 million people use crypto globally, with bitcoin accounting for just under half that number.\n\nThere are 88,200 crypto millionaires, 182 centi-millionaires (worth $100 million or more), while 22 individuals have crypto assets worth $1 billion, the report found.\n\nInvesting in bitcoin has also proved a lucrative investment for some \u2013 there's about 40,500 people who have crypto holdings worth $1 million, while six own bitcoin assets valued at $1 billion, per the report.\n\nThe findings come as bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, dropped 11% in August. That was the second consecutive monthly decline amid a broader sell-off in stocks and bonds.\n\nBitcoin was trading at about $25,758 on Thursday.\n\nThe token soared about 80% in the first six months of 2023 and is still up more than 55% year-to-date despite August's losses.\n\nThat's come as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates at a historically fast pace to combat inflation. Higher borrowing costs usually weigh on high-risk assets such as crypto.\n\nSome market experts remain bullish on bitcoin despite the recent signs of stress \u2013 and some even claim the token could hit $100,000 by 2025.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "title": "How to Buy Bitcoin? - FX Empire",
        "content": "Can I Use Regular Money to Buy Bitcoin?\n\nCash can be used to buy Bitcoin and there are a number of ways to do this. LocalBitcoins is the most popular exchange that allows Bitcoin to be purchased by cash. The Bitcoin trade can be carried out in person or by way of a cash deposit.\n\nLocalBitcoin locates a Bitcoin seller willing to accept cash and requests the prospective buyer to place the order for the number of Bitcoins wanted who then receives the account number of the seller for cash to be deposited. Once the buyer provides proof of the cash deposit, the Bitcoins are then sent to the buyer\u2019s LocalBitcoin wallet.\n\nThe alternative to depositing the cash into the seller\u2019s account would be to meet the seller face to face and give the money in person, though as always, it\u2019s important to make sure that buyers remain vigilant. Also, it\u2019s important to be aware of the fraud.\n\nBecause LocalBitcoin and similar agents ensure privacy, the price of Bitcoin is between 5-10% higher than the price on exchanges and there is a flat 1% fee for each transaction.\n\nOther companies that look to match cash buyers with Bitcoin sellers include:\n\nBitQuick, Wall of Coins, LibertyX, Bitit and then there are Bitcoin ATMs that also allow cash purchases of Bitcoins.\n\nDo note that buying and selling Bitcoins on LocalBitcoin and the other agents listed above are for smaller transactions. Buying a large number of Bitcoins is more difficult and Bitcoin ATMs will have limits that would require additional information for larger purchases.\n\nGetting a Bitcoin Wallet\n\nWhen looking to buy BTC, it is strongly recommended that the Bitcoins purchased are not stored on the exchange once purchased and that the Bitcoins are kept in a wallet created by the buyer.\n\nA wallet is essentially the same as a bank account and in very much the same way, allows the owner of the wallet to send, receive and hold Bitcoins\n\nTwo common forms of wallet used are software wallets and web / hosted wallets. Software wallets are installed on a computer or mobile, with the owner of the wallet in complete control over the security of the Bitcoins held. Hosted wallets are created on 3rd party websites and are considered much easier to create and use, the only issue is that the host would need to be trusted to ensure that adequate privacy measures are always in place.\n\nFor those looking to create a wallet, recommended sites include Coinbase and Blockchain.info.\n\nFace-to-face, or \u2018over-the-counter\u2019 (OTC) trades\n\nAs we discussed earlier, the two most common ways to buy or sell Bitcoin are either face to face with cash or on an exchange/broker.\n\nFace-to-face transactions are the small investor looking to buy and sell a small number of Bitcoins anonymously. In stark contrast is the OTC market, where particularly large amounts of Bitcoins are bought and sold, the buyers and sellers being referred to as whales within the crypto world.\n\nThe benefit of an over-the-counter trade for those looking to buy a substantial number of Bitcoins is that the entire transaction would be carried out at a negotiated price that is likely to be more favorable than an average price for Bitcoins bought through an exchange.\n\nExchanges will have significantly less liquidity and Bitcoin buyers would need to break down the total number of Bitcoins to buy through smaller lots. The issue here is that each purchase could push the price up and more so if there is a lack of liquidity, by the time the buyer purchases the final batch of Bitcoins, the price may have moved considerably. This is not only likely to be less cost-efficient, but also less time efficient.\n\nThe commonality between face to face and over-the-counter transactions is that, in both instances, a counterparty is located for the trade. The difference will be that there is unlikely to be a negotiation on price in a face to face trade, while OTC transactions will involve a negotiation on price.\n\nOTC transactions will be carried out through exchanges and broker/dealers. Dealers will generally trade using their own funds, while brokers link buyers and sellers and negotiate on price for the buyer, whilst charging a fee. Bitcoin exchange OTC trading desks are used for the more sizeable transactions that go into the millions of dollars.\n\nSuggested Articles: How to Buy Bitcoin Cash?\n\nBitcoin Exchanges\n\nIt\u2019s quite important to select the right exchange. Unlike deciding which bank account or credit card to apply for, Bitcoin and the crypto world is unregulated, making it essential to ensure that the exchange chosen is not going to put your money or your Bitcoins at risk.\n\nThe location of the exchange is the first consideration. Where the buyer lives and the laws and regulations differ by geography, so it would be recommended to buy Bitcoins on an exchange that is in the same country as the buyer.\n\nOnce the list of exchanges has been identified by geography, the next step would be to identify the most competitive and also the most widely used exchanges. Transaction fees vary across the exchanges and some may have additional fees. While looking to find an exchange with competitive fees, it is worth paying a little more to use an exchange that has a sizeable order book.\n\nExchanges that have a large number of customers will tend to make public their order book, which then shows how liquid the exchange is.\n\nOther factors to consider when deciding on the best exchange include:\n\nHow well known is the exchange? There are a number of forums on the internet where reviews are available on the exchanges and it is worth doing some due diligence.\n\nHow long it takes for Bitcoins to be received following a purchase and how quickly funds will be received in event of a sale. On this note, it would also be important to make sure that prices are locked in at the time of purchase or sale and not on the day on which the Bitcoins are received or funds are remitted.\n\nExchange security is of significant importance. For greater security, exchanges selected should be on an HTTPS site and should request secure logins to limit the possibility of being hacked.\n\nFinally, obviously knowing how you can buy and sell Bitcoins is of importance and will vary from person to person. Some exchanges will accept payments by wire transfer, credit/debit cards, PayPal and even cash.\n\nWhen considering the method of payment, exchanges may not always carry the currency of the country that the exchange is located in and it is important to gauge how competitive exchange rates and fees are across the exchanges available.\n\nBitcoin Mining\n\nWhile the majority are looking to buy and sell Bitcoin to try to make a tidy return on investment, there are those that are looking to enter the world of mining. Mining for Bitcoin is perhaps the most challenging of the mining environments within the cryptoworld, with miners needing significant computer power to be able to compete with existing miners.\n\nBitcoin mining is the validation of transactions that take place on each Bitcoin block. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin means that transactions are broadcasted to a peer-to-peer network and once broadcasted, needs to be verified, confirming that the transaction is valid and then having the transaction recorded on the public transaction database, which is known as the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMiners basically are the people involved in the processing and verifying of transactions before then recording the transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMiners will then receive transaction fees in the form of newly created Bitcoins.\n\nMiners compete with everyone on the peer-to-peer network to earn Bitcoins. The faster the processing power, the more attempts are made by the hardware to attempt to complete the verification, etc., earning the miner the Bitcoins that are highly sought after along with transaction fees.\n\nThe speed of processing power in Bitcoin mining is referred to as the hashrate and the processing power is referred to as the hashpower of the hardware.\n\nIn the early days, Bitcoin was mined using CPUs, but in the race to generate more income, miners shifted to Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). Then came Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) followed by Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that are used today.\n\nFor miners, the key metric is hashing power and the more hashpower, the more money miners can make. Today\u2019s miners have warehouses of mining equipment, with Bitcoin\u2019s mining community concentrated to a small number who account for the majority of the hashpower.\n\nBecause of the concentration of hashpower, not to mention the significant cost to set up a mining network, it\u2019s recommended to join a mining pool, where miners combine computing power or to mine via cloud mining. For those looking to mine using a CPU or laptop, entering a mining pool will be of little value, since the mining income earned is proportional to the computer power contributed. A CPU or laptop just won\u2019t be offering much compared with GPUs and ASICs hardware.\n\nFor cloud mining, you won\u2019t feel the mining experience, just the income, though after fees etc., it\u2019s not going to be earth-shattering.\n\nBitcoin cloud mining does provide a medium in which to receive newly mined Bitcoins, without the need to own costly mining hardware or even have any mining know-how, allowing the mining world to not only attract the technically minded but a far wider audience, who lack the technical knowledge needed to get into Bitcoin mining.\n\nOne of the major concerns over cloud mining is fraud, however. There have been plenty of reports of fraudulent activity, not to mention lower profits and even mining companies having the ability to halt operations should Bitcoin\u2019s price fall below certain levels, so some due diligence on a mining company is recommended, with some basic steps to reduce the risk of being defrauded including:\n\nNo mining address and/or no user selectable pool.\n\nNo ASIC vendor endorsement. If there are no advertisements from the ASIC vendor, the mining company may not even own the hardware.\n\nNo photos of the hardware or data center of the mining company.\n\nNo limit imposed on sales or does not display how much hash rate sold against used in mining.\n\nReferral programs and social networking. A mining company willing to pay high referral fees should be avoided as these may well be Ponzi schemes.\n\nAnonymous operators should certainly be avoided\u2026\n\nNo ability to sell your position or get the money out upon sale.\n\nSuggested Article: How Blockchain will change our Life, Economy and the World\n\nBitcoin ATMs\n\nBitcoin ATMs are not like your traditional bank ATMs that dispense with cash from your bank account. The purpose of Bitcoin ATMs is to facilitate the purchase and sale of Bitcoins on an internet connected machine.\n\nThe ATMs allow you to insert cash to purchase Bitcoins or dispense cash in the case of a sale. Unlike the traditional bank ATMs, Bitcoin ATMs are not linked in any way to banking networks and it\u2019s also worth noting that transaction fees can be particularly high.\n\nThe world\u2019s first Bitcoin ATM was reported to have been introduced in Vancouver, Canada back in October 2013.\n\nToday, Bitcoin ATMs are located worldwide, with a reported 30 different types of Bitcoin ATMs and as Bitcoin becomes increasingly more popular. ATM providers will likely widen the net to attract the traffic that can generate transaction fees of 7%, before even considering exchange rates that are certainly considered less competitive than high street banks.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt\u2019s a whole new world for many even though Bitcoin has been in existence since 2008. The continued rise in value and talks of $100,000 have brought in a new wave of investors. With the scheduled launch of Bitcoin futures in December and the likely influx of institutional money, there will be more interest and the Bitcoin net will be widening. Whether this is a Bitcoin bubble or something more sustainable remains to be seen, after all, even the dot.com saw a mix of institutional and retail investors get burned. For now, the key to Bitcoin\u2019s growth will be dependent on the Bitcoin world\u2019s ability to educate and facilitate the buying and selling of Bitcoin.\n\nA multitude of new companies has been established that have begun fundraising through the Initial Coin Offering market, with the cryptocurrency world in a hurry to catch up with the more mature, traditional financial markets.\n\nCertain countries have already begun accepting Bitcoin as a means to buy, Japan has been one of the first movers and this is likely to continue to evolve in time.\n\nCash may be king, but knowledge is wealth. Going into Bitcoin at such levels requires both cash and knowledge, not to mention a resilience to noise and volatility. After all, this is the only asset class that has left investors ruing an early sale when faced with adversity."

        "content": "NORTH TEXAS (CBSNewsTexas.com) \u2014 As the strain on the state's power grid continues, a bitcoin miner with operations in North Texas is making money off the situation.\n\nAt Texas-based Riot Platforms, thousands of computers are mining bitcoin. The operation is highly energy intensive.\n\nHowever, during last month's record-breaking heat wave, it cut down consumption. ERCOT paid the company $31.7 million in energy credits to do so. That's roughly $22 million more than the value of the bitcoin it mined that month.\n\n\"I have been saying throughout June, July and August that every time ERCOT put out an announcement that the grid was tight, we should conserve. Just know in your heart that bitcoin miners who are part of ancillary services or demand response are getting paid big bucks,\" Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining founder Jackie Sawicky said.\n\nFor more than a year, the Navarro County-based nonprofit has been expressing concern over operations. This latest news has left its 600 plus members furious.\n\n\"We have a 16% poverty rate,\" Sawicky said. \"We have single moms and senior citizens right now having to decide between feeding themselves and their kids and keeping the lights on and paying their electricity bills.\"\n\nIn a statement, Riot Platforms CEO Jason Les said:\n\n\"The effects of these credits significantly lower Riot's cost to mine bitcoin and are a key element in making Riot one of the lowest cost producers of bitcoin in the industry.\"\n\nERCOT told CBS News Texas that \"companies have to qualify for these programs and follow the rules. The service is the ability to curtail.\"\n\nSawicky said they are not alright with this. \"Real solutions are transmission lines to bring solar and wind to densely populated areas. We need battery warehouses and energy efficiency and conservation.\"\n\nThe Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining said they are hosting several events next month to continue demanding action against this.\n\nCBS News Texas reached out to Riot Platforms for comment, but so far has not received a response."

        "content": "Risk assets including crypto seem to be kind of going boring. Is kind of is the way I would describe it is going nowhere for a little while. Uh That's uh that's happening as new research from Chicago Fed economists suggests that the central bank has raised rates, interest, particularly fed funds rates enough to take care of that 2% inflation target without having a recession. Well, that's just one that's just one fed's opinion. What about everything else? Joining us now to discuss the e to us investment analyst, Callie Cox. Welcome back, Callie. Hey, happy to be back. Happy Friday. Oh yeah, you said it. Thank you. So I I let let, let's talk here economists here because and also fed fed presidents and, and the like because we kind of hear a lot of mixed messages. On the one hand here, we have a Chicago Fed economist saying uh yeah, this is enough. On the other hand, you hear from others like man, this there might be some room here, but it looks like the market kind of is betting and for the time being that September, no rate hike. First of all, I wanna get is it enough? Who, who do you think is right here? Second of all, will there be a hike? Are you gonna be an outlier here for September? Yeah. Two very good questions. So, let's start with the first one. Who's right. I don't, I don't know if the fed even knows what, what, uh, they're going to do in September. And I say this, uh, with a very serious undertone because, you know, the fed has said over and over again that they're data dependent. And yes, we do get mixed messages from fed speakers. I think that's one of the cons of, you know, having greater transparency from the FED these days. Um, you know, different fed members have different fed opinions. There are research teams at different fed banks, um, and I can say different things and I think the, the underlying, you know, motto that you need to grab from that is, you know, just be careful with what you listen to, um, on, you know, the rates part, you know, if we could see a rate hike in July, uh, excuse me, September, where are we, um, if we see a rate hike in September, you know, i it's plausible we could see it happen. But right now we're telling customers to focus on the fact that rates could stay high for a while because a 25 basis point rate hike if it happens, uh, is just a blip on the radar when you consider that rates have already been hiked 5% and there's already a lot of pressure on the economy. Yeah, I, you know, a couple of things on that point. First of all, I, I, you kind of almost missed the days when the only signals you got were like what briefcase, um, Callen Greenspan was holding. Uh, you're too young to remember that. But I, I remember that it was like different types of briefcases told us what could be happening like it became, it was like kind of a form of kremlinology. Another term you probably are too young to understand. Uh but it was a um and nonetheless that that's kind of like something that happened. And as you pointed out, it is maybe the fact that there is all this transparency particularly under Powell a problem, I mean, like is it, is it actually making things worse for the economy because people can't uh particularly the bond markets can't quite judge what's going to happen even more. So, I mean, it's sort of a is it, is it a, is it too much of a good thing? I actually think it's an effective tool from the Fed's point of view because the Fed can test out different policy stances and different, you know, ideas and see how investors and consumers react to them. Of course, that makes it more confusing for investors because you get more signals and people like to hang on to FED speakers every word these days. So I think it just depends on where you're sitting. And I, I also see some pros for investors too, you know, especially if you like trading volatility. Uh But, you know, it, it does require you to change your, you know, almost change your strategy when it comes to, you know, trying to read the Feds tea leaves. If you're a long-term investor and 99% of what the fed says doesn't really matter to you. And you need to focus on, you know, what you're seeing from the economy and earnings. Speaking of reading the tea leaves, it seems that economists are also divided on if a recession is looming in the US. What are your thoughts there? Yeah. So there's certainly a lot of pressure on the economy right now and we've been one of the more optimistic firms out there, you know, saying that the job market is strong, consumers are spending. It's really hard to be in a recession when consumer spending is 70% of the economy. And those two conditions are in place. Uh, obviously we're seeing the job market weakening. Uh, you know, I'm a little concerned about the pressure valves we're seeing in higher oil prices and a stronger dollar. I mean, both of those can drain the global economy and put a lot more pressure on consumers' wallets. So, you know, I see the, you know, bias towards cyclicals out there. I see the fact that speculative coins are picking up and, you know, we're just warning customers to be cautious here, you know, don't fully step out of risk. Um, but just be, be careful about the risks. You take, look for that quality risks or, you know, companies and protocols that could survive a recession if it happens. I getting back to this whole idea of risk, you know, here we are, we have the, uh, we have the fed funds rate at 5% probably headed north to, you know, further north. Um, what, uh, it doesn't that kind of create a, a hurdle rate for, uh, taking on that extra risk that, uh, some of these, these outliers, these alt coins just can't match, uh, given the cost of borrowing I, I, is, it, it, is there a long term problem uh ahead for alt coins? Uh, and, and by all coins, I don't just mean, uh, you know, kind of like the, the bottom of the barrel. I'm talking about some of the top, top twenties. Is there, is there something to be, um, I don't know, just kind of like, er, maybe that's just a risk too far. Yeah, Lawrence, I think you hit the nail on the head there when rates are high, investors have to be more skeptical about where they put their money because that hurdle rate is higher. I mean, we've seen that since the beginning of 2022 when the FED started raising rates and if rates remain at 5% or even higher than 5% for a bit, that hurdle rate is 5%. And investors are faced with this choice of, you know, putting money into a money market fund, getting 5% or a little bit more and, or, you know, taking the risk at higher rates and stepping into an all coin that's a little more speculative. Um, and that is essentially a projection of the future. Um And we all know the time value of money, you know, when rates are high, the future of a value dollar, uh the value of future dollar decreases. So take that all into consideration, there's less money out there, less appetite to take on risk. And you know, when there's a finite amount of money, a finite amount of funding, it may flow to more quality sources. And that's the base of our opinion here. I mean, look all coins are exciting. Um I understand the, you know, the reasoning and investing behind them and I think, you know, the types of investors who invest in them like to learn more and they like a little bit of action. Uh But at the same time, you know, if you're a long-term investor, you have to realize that all coins are a little behind the eight ball here. Um And they're at a disadvantage because they don't have that utility yet. They don't have, you know, those cash flows that people will, you know, search for in a high rate environment. All right, we got to get Bitcoin into the fold here before we go, you have a few encouraging storylines about Bitcoin, talk to us about what those are. Yeah. So speaking of utility, I mean, I think it's very encouraging for crypto ambassadors that we keep seeing headlines about how Bitcoin is finding its way into the mainstream market. I mean, yesterday we saw the news that JP Morgan was considering um decentralized tokens for, you know, showing different securities. Um Of course, we got the gray scale ruling last week. I mean, all of these are evidence that, you know, institutions are looking into Bitcoin. You know, we're taking it steps further and I'm not a Bitcoin Maxi, like let me be clear here. But when you look at crypto as a whole, you need to understand that there are different levels of risk there. Um And you know, I've been saying for a while, you know, crypto needs to prove its utility. I think it's happening in certain spaces and we're seeing that most prominently with Bitcoin and Ethereum and, you know, specifically Bitcoin over the past few weeks. All right, Kelly, thanks for joining us. It's always a pleasure having you on. I hope you have a good weekend. Yeah. Thank you y'all too. That was it to us investment analyst, Kelly Cox."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining outfit Riot Platforms earned $31.7 million from Texas power authorities last month for curtailing operations \u2013 far more than the value of the Bitcoin it mined in the same period.\n\nIn a press release yesterday, Riot said it produced 333 Bitcoin at its mining operations in Rockdale, Texas, which would have been worth just shy of $9 million on August 31. All the cash earned from those energy credits, on the other hand, equates to around 1,136 Bitcoin, Riot CEO Jason Les said in the company's monthly update.\n\n\"August was a landmark month for Riot in showcasing the benefits of our unique power strategy,\" Les said. \"Riot achieved a new monthly record for Power and Demand Response Credits \u2026 which surpassed the total amount of all Credits received in 2022.\n\n\"These credits significantly lower Riot's cost to mine Bitcoin and are a key element in making Riot one of the lowest cost producers of Bitcoin in the industry,\" Les said.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) operates a demand response program that allows big energy consumers, like Riot, to earn power credits for using less of it for operations and selling power back to the grid, as well as additional credit for being enrolled in its demand response programs.\n\nAs we reported in August of last year, the company earned $9.5 million in credits during a July 2022 heatwave as well \u2013 still far less than it earned in Texas's hottest August on record this year.\n\nEnergy prices have been generally up, and aren't coming down, but you know what has deflated? The price of a Bitcoin. Sure, the price of 1 BTC has been up from the depths it plumbed late last year, but hovering in the mid-$20k range all year is nothing like the heady late-2021 highs of near $70k per coin.\n\nThe combination of inflated electricity costs and a drop in the value of Bitcoin means mining simply isn't as profitable as it was in 2021, the year Riot's revenue soared as demand for, and the value of, Bitcoins rose.\n\nFast forward just a year and things began looking different. Losses followed as Bitcoin prices plummeted and trade volume started to shrink \u2013 a problem that has only continued in the crypto world.\n\nAnalysts see Bitcoin miners struggling, and JPMorgan Chase said recently that the market cap of the largest Bitcoin mining firms in the US dropped by 21 percent in August. Surprise, surprise \u2013 Riot, with a 39 percent drop in market cap over the month, was the worst hit. While Riot's stock is up this year, like Bitcoin its value has dropped precipitously since 2021, when the mining firm peaked at $71.33 a share. Today it's worth just $11.10.\n\nBut if ERCOT is going to pay the market mWh rate for not mining, it can't be that bad of a business model.\n\nNeither ERCOT nor Riot responded to questions for this story. \u00ae"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is about to test hodlers with a \u201cmid cycle lull\u201d before starting a bull run in late 2024, a new BTC price model states.\n\nAccording to its creator, popular analyst CryptoCon, the \u201cNovember 28th Cycles Theory\u201d demands the BTC price all-time high in 2025.\n\nCountdown to BTC price \u201cbull run launch\u201d\n\nAmid debate over the nature of the current Bitcoin four-year price cycle, CryptoCon believes that all may be simpler than many imagine when it comes to how BTC/USD behaves at a given time.\n\nUnveiling the \u201cNovember 28th\u201d chart on X (formerly Twitter), he delineated the date as a key pivot point in the year, along with a three-week period on either side.\n\n\u201cUsing 4-year time cycles against my Theory, produces Bitcoins exact behavior in time since its inception. Cycles are centered around the date of the first halving Nov 28th,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cBitcoin price action began at the first bottom October 8th, 2010. This is where cycle curves peak, every 4 years. Tops and bottoms come +/- 21 days from Nov 28th at their appropriate times on the curve. Tops on the upswing, bottoms on the pinnacle.\u201d\n\nThe chart describes November 28 as the date Bitcoin sees a \u201cbull run launch\u201d every four years. The last was in 2020 when BTC/USD broke beyond its prior all-time high (ATH) to hit its current $69,000 record a year later.\n\nThe next point of interest is thus November 2024. Until then, BTC price action will spend its time in a \u201cmid cycle lull.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter Bitcoin bottoms, price makes an early first cycle move (orange) and enters into a mid-cycle lull,\u201d CryptoCon continued.\n\n\u201cThis is the longest part of the cycle, where Bitcoin spends time around the median price (half of previous ATH), until the curve bottoms.\u201d\n\nBitcoin November 28th theory chart. Source: CryptoCon/X\n\nHe added that Bitcoin had \u201calmost certainly\u201d seen its early top, referencing the $31,800 local highs from July.\n\nA Bitcoin \u201cbull market fakeout\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, opinions on where BTC price action will go into the 2024 block subsidy halving differ.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin halving can take BTC price to $148K by July 2025 \u2014 Pantera Capital\n\nSome argue that modest gains will be all that hodlers will see before the event, scheduled for April next year.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph this week, Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, nonetheless delivered a $46,000 target for the halving, with $35,000 slated for year-end.\n\nIn his latest newsletter published on Sept. 5, meanwhile, CryptoCon summarized 2023 BTC price behavior as a \u201cbull market fakeout.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis makes it appear as if the bull market has begun with the trigger of many signals, but then at some point, price fails to continue,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is the most convincing example we\u2019ve seen of this yet. Personally, I think there is still some time to go for that and I am patiently awaiting its completion.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBTC/USD traded at $26,200 at the time of writing on Sept. 8, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin Miner Warns Lawmakers Of 'Chinese Takeover In Wyoming' - Cowboy State Daily",
        "content": "Chinese-connected corporations have allegedly acquired land next to Sean Murphy\u2019s bitcoin mining operation in the Campstool Business Park outside Cheyenne, which has killed an agreement his company had with the state of Wyoming.\n\nMurphy, who represents Bison Blockchain, told the Legislature\u2019s Management Audit Committee on Wednesday that a conglomerate of about eight \u201ccorporate entities\u201d run by Chinese nationals with varying levels of connections to companies in China \u2014 including the largest manufacturer of bitcoin miners in the world \u2014 have pushed his Wyoming-based company out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a diverse, complicated flow from Chinese nationals operating companies,\u201d Murphy said in warning lawmakers about the potential for Chinese companies to exploit Wyoming\u2019s business and land-use laws.\n\nHe said although some of the companies that buried Bison Blockchain are based in Wyoming, they are all connected to China.\n\n\u201cWe came to learn that they were Chinese,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a Chinese takeover in Wyoming.\u201d\n\nWhat Murphy didn\u2019t tell the committee is that his business had a prior relationship with at least some of these companies.\n\nIn May, Bison Blockchain filed a $22 million lawsuit in Wyoming federal court against five companies based in either Delaware or the Cayman Islands related to its bitcoin mines in Cheyenne. The lawsuit accuses the companies of breach of contract, covenants of good faith and fair dealing, enterprise liability and intentional interference with contractual relations.\n\nWhat Are They Doing?\n\nBlockchain mining is the process of adding transaction records to the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn June 2022, Black Hills Energy entered into a five-year service agreement with Bison Blockchain involving up to 45 megawatts of power, with an option to expand to as much as 75 megawatts at the North Range Business Park in Cheyenne.\n\nBlack Hills said at the time that the facility \"will represent one of the largest bitcoin mining operations in the region,\" according to a press release from the utility.\n\n\u201cWe were the largest bitcoin miners in the state until we weren't,\u201d Murphy told the committee.\n\nIn October 2022, Bison Blockchain broke ground on the future site of its MineOne Data Center at North Range. It is now suing MineOne as one of the parties in the lawsuit.\n\nHow It Works\n\nPower is an incredibly important valuable asset in bitcoin mining and the data centers that typically house these operations, as they need a significant amount of electricity to run their operations.\n\nBison Blockchain leased state land next to a large Black Hills Energy substation to run its operations off 30-45 megawatts of power. To put that number in perspective, Murphy said the entire city of Cheyenne runs on about 100-120 megawatts.\n\nTheir business model was to generate revenue for the state on a per-miner basis, the process of creating valid blocks that add transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger. For each Bitcoin miner, the company would pay the state $1 per month.\n\nBison Blockchain was paying the state $5,000 a year on its 10-year lease.\n\nMurphy said a large mine like Bison could result in 10,000-15,000 bitcoin miners, representing as much as $1 million to $2 million revenue for the state over the course of its 10-year lease.\n\n\u201cThe more bitcoin that we mined, the more money the state made,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a great win-win-win.\u201d\n\nMurphy said the other companies acquired private land next to the Black Hills substation and have since taken over Bison Blockchain\u2019s service agreement with Black Hills. Now, Murphy said the companies will be using Black Hills power to mine their own bitcoin, all of the proceeds of which he believes will eventually go to China.\n\n\u201cWhat we trying to do was generate more revenue for the state on this state land, but that\u2019s been wiped out,\u201d he said.\n\nMurphy said Bison Blockchain will continue to honor its lease agreement with the state and will compete with the new competition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to compete with the Chinese,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to roll over.\u201d\n\nBut he implored the committee to help shore up state regulations, saying the situation is \u201cnot good\u201d and needs to be addressed.\n\nDuring the 2023 legislative session, two bills were drafted that prohibited Chinese ownership of land in Wyoming. Both died before making significant traction.\n\nHow Committed?\n\nState Sen. Tara Nethercott, R-Cheyenne, questioned Murphy if he would commit to not selling his company out to a high bidder some day, which could be a company connected to China.\n\nMurphy didn\u2019t deny that his company is in business to make money and that they wouldn\u2019t pass up an ideal situation to sell someday. But he also said his company has \u201clearned our lesson\u201d from working with Chinese companies.\n\nHe said Bison\u2019s original 10-year lease agreement with the state could have led to more revenue through additional state land leases in the future, where even bitcoin could have gone to the state\u2019s coffers.\n\n\u201cThat is an asset I believe the state should look at acquiring,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, Murphy said, the U.S. government only takes in bitcoin by seizure.\n\nLeo Wolfson can be reached at Leo@CowboyStateDaily.com."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose 1.1% from Sept. 1 to Sept. 8 to US$26,267 as of 3:30 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading below US$30,000 since Aug. 9, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nAfter falling to a weekly low of US$25,413 last Friday, Bitcoin briefly rose above US$26,000 on Sunday and Monday before regaining the support level on Friday.\n\n\u201cDespite Grayscale\u2019s recent court win, investor confidence in Bitcoin remains subdued. The court victory failed to boost the Bitcoin price,\u201d Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cThe lackluster response indicates generally bearish sentiment in the crypto sector. Investors are increasingly diversifying their portfolios with assets other than Bitcoin, such as stocks or real estate. While the crypto markets have been relatively quiet in recent months, the stock market offers them more volatility and therefore opportunity.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, asset manager Grayscale\u2019s lawyers sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting a meeting with the agency about the path to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Grayscale\u2019s lawyers said that there are no grounds for the SEC to continue to block the conversion.\n\nThis pivotal ruling is not only a beacon of optimism for Grayscale but may also pave the way for other financial heavyweights, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, waiting for the SEC\u2019s decision on their own spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Image: Grayscale/SEC\n\nOn Wednesday, asset manager Ark Invest filed for a spot Ether ETF in the U.S., naming Coinbase as a custodian. If accepted, this would be the first publicly traded Ether ETF in the U.S. Despite the positive development, Ether, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, inched up 0.16% over the week to US$1,647.\n\nOn the same day, Bitcoin received institutional fair value accounting approval from the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The long-awaited rules will kick in in 2025, allowing companies with large Bitcoin holdings to report their assets at fair value, capturing the most up-to-date value of the asset and making it easier for companies to hold Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price action may also be affected by the September effect, which refers to the phenomenon where traditional equity performance is historically weaker during the month, according to Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto.\n\n\u201cWhile there is some statistical evidence from the last century supporting its existence, many economists and market professionals dismiss it as a reliable predictor. If one accepts the September effect as true for equity markets and given that correlations between Bitcoin and traditional markets are currently positive, it\u2019s conceivable that a weak September in the stock market could also influence Bitcoin prices negatively,\u201d Betz told Forkast.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.05 trillion on Friday at 3:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, maintaining the same value from a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$511 billion, Bitcoin represented 48.5% of the market while Ether, valued at US$198 billion, accounted for 18.8%.\n\nNotable movers: SNX, IOTA\n\nThe native cryptocurrency of decentralized finance protocol Synthetix (SNX) was this week\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 100, rallying 17.07% to US$2.26. The coin started gaining on Monday, shortly after the protocol announced details about the upcoming perpetual futures V3 testnet, including a trading competition on the new testnet with a US$5,000 reward for first place.\n\nThe utility token of the IOTA protocol (MIOTA), a blockchain designed for value and data transfers on the Internet of Things, was this week\u2019s second-biggest gainer, rising 14.57% to US$0.1791. The token started picking up momentum on Wednesday after the protocol announced that the victims of the 2018 online seed generation scam will have their losses refunded.\n\nNext week: Could Bitcoin fall to US$20,300?\n\n\u201cTechnical analysis of Bitcoin\u2019s price charts reveals concerning patterns. The formation of lower highs, price reversals to the downside, and failure to breach key resistance levels indicate a potential continuation of the ongoing downward trend,\u201d wrote Yield App\u2019s Kiely.\n\n\u201cWhile trend lines suggest Bitcoin could fall below US$20,000, it could also revisit US$23,000 in a Fibonacci retrace.\u201d\n\nArk Invest\u2019s The Bitcoin Monthly report also noted that Bitcoin has a downside risk of US$20,300, which is the market\u2019s average cost basis.\n\nNext week, investors will be looking forward to the release of the U.S. core consumer price index, which measures the inflation of goods and services, excluding foods and energy.\n\nOver in Europe, the European Central Bank\u2019s next interest rate decision is scheduled for next Thursday.\n\nSee related article: N.

        "content": "In this episode of \u201cThe Bitcoin Verdict,\u201d host and partner Hailey Lennon is joined by J. Gdanski, CEO and founder of cryptocurrency insurance company Evertas, to discuss how his company navigates an industry that doesn\u2019t fit into traditional insurance coverage and policies. Evertas is a client of Brown Rudnick.\n\nOne of the bigger challenges in providing insurance in the crypto space is complexities in calculating and covering risk, according to Gdanski.\n\n\u201cWhat is unique about what we\u2019re doing, which is different than what was done with cyber, is we actually have deep technical experts from the field and the industry that we\u2019re trying to insure, and we started with the kind of bottom-up risk management and risk assessment framework, and from there, it came to pricing its products,\u201d Gdanski said. \u201cWhat was done with cyber was just this sort of top-down thing; it was designed by insurance people who were not experts in anything except for insurance.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2017, Evertas is a crypto insurance company that develops regulated insurance and risk mitigation solutions for crypto assets. The Chicago-based company focuses on covering institutional holders of crypto assets including exchanges, custodians, traditional financial institutions, funds, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals.\n\nBefore starting Evertas, Gdanski was a leader in the enterprise blockchain space and was one of the first to work on institutional custody for crypto. He also served as an early contributor to blockchain consortia, including Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, of which he was a founding member.\n\nAs the need for crypto insurance develops, government agencies and regulators are starting to have an interest in people having coverage to protect themselves, Gdanski said.\n\n\u201cIt used to be \u2018have insurance, just show them a piece of paper that says insurance with your company\u2019s name on it or not,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s changed, shockingly. Sooner than I thought, actually. So people with money transmitter licenses, they would have these Fidelity insurance policies, they were relatively inexpensive, and I thought it would be sometime this year or next, but they started last year.\u201d\n\nHe said companies that are dealing in cryptocurrency and fiat started getting questions last year from regulators and the government about why their policies only covered the fiat transfers, not crypto.\n\nAnd now, those companies are being required to have crypto insurance, as well, which led to a number of panicked phone calls from people who couldn\u2019t operate their business until they got a new insurance policy, Gdanski said.\n\n\u201cI think certainly, when you look at Hong Kong, for years Hong Kong authorities had very stringent insurance requirements,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are likely to be some coming out of the EU, they\u2019re already in the UAE.

        "title": "10 years later, still no Bitcoin ETF \u2014 but who cares? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application, filed in July 2013, was denied in both 2017 and 2018. A decade has passed since that initial application, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected more than a dozen additional applications and repeatedly punted the date for deciding on others.\n\nThe ETF saga\u2019s latest iteration saw Bitcoin (BTC) jump more than 6% as industry advocates celebrated a court ruling that affirmed what we already knew \u2014 that the SEC\u2019s rejection of Grayscale\u2019s ETF application was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d This was, of course, followed by the SEC delaying its decision on all seven pending Bitcoin ETFs, and a subsequent price drop.\n\nNow we wait as the SEC deliberates on its next move and Grayscale pleads for approval.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: Even worse for crypto than central exchanges\n\nTo a degree, the case for a Bitcoin ETF makes sense in the spirit of adoption. The $7 trillion ETF industry is ripe with investors still on the crypto sidelines, awaiting a product that would grant them Bitcoin exposure without having to buy BTC directly and set up a wallet. Plus, as a community that\u2019s fought long and hard to have digital assets taken seriously, the crypto world is inclined to welcome the validation that a United States spot ETF would signal.\n\nBut crypto, Bitcoin especially, is predicated on the need for an alternative financial system \u2014 one that enables the financial sovereignty, transparency and consensus that traditional finance (TradFi) so glaringly lacks. The crypto industry\u2019s eagerness for an SEC ETF approval feels like a step backward, akin to American revolutionaries begging Parliament to intermediate colonial tax collection after rejecting its imperial rule.\n\nMainstream adoption is a ubiquitous goal among crypto champions, and an SEC sign-off on a BTC vehicle that resonates with TradFi is ostensibly a fast track to it. But fighting for approval from an opaque centralized agency for an intermediated investment product belies our industry\u2019s purpose. And frankly, it\u2019s unnecessary.\n\nThe irony of cautious investors waiting to buy Bitcoin ETF shares rather than taking the safer route of buying BTC directly is palpable. ETFs bear many layers of counterparty risk, including the sponsor, custodian and other partners. We saw how catastrophic this type of risk can be in crypto during the latest contagion, when customers lost more than $10 billion within months because they trusted third parties. Though the contagion appears to have dwindled, the major takeaway remains: If you don\u2019t have the private keys to your Bitcoin, your assets aren\u2019t in your control, and they may not even exist.\n\nThose of us who witnessed the fallout up close know this. But investors who\u2019ve been waiting on the sidelines for an ETF likely do not. It\u2019s our job as industry builders and veterans to help newcomers understand the new degree of security and risk aversion that Bitcoin\u2019s technology enables.\n\nThe downside of a spot Bitcoin ETF runs deeper than the conceptual contradiction and the unknowing purchases of a riskier investment. The potential cost for the crypto movement is immense.\n\nTake, for example, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust, the announcement of which drove Bitcoin\u2019s price to a one-year high in June. However, perhaps blinded by the prospect of monumental institutional inflows, much of the Bitcoin community, myself included, has thrown its support behind BlackRock\u2019s iteration of TradFi 2.0, haphazardly disguised as Bitcoin conviction.\n\nRelated: An ETF will bring a revolution for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\n\nBuried within BlackRock\u2019s submission is a clause on hard forks. It states:\n\nThe Sponsor will [\u2026] use its discretion to determine which network should be considered the appropriate network for the Trust\u2019s purposes, and in doing so may adversely affect the value of the Shares. [...] There is no guarantee that the Sponsor will choose the digital asset that is ultimately the most valuable fork. [\u2026] The Sponsor may also disagree with Shareholders, the Bitcoin Custodian, other service providers, the Index Administrator, cryptocurrency exchanges, or other market participants on what is generally accepted as Bitcoin and should therefore be considered \u2018bitcoin\u2019 for the Trust\u2019s purposes, which may also adversely affect the value of the Shares as a result.\n\nThat clause basically introduces ambiguity around the consensus mechanism for a protocol that already has a very well-defined and battle-tested mechanism.\n\nOn a broader level, BlackRock will undoubtedly amass an enormous Bitcoin supply, while its iShares ETF may be subject to opacity and possible rehypothecation. This puts shareholders at risk of having only a paper claim to Bitcoin that\u2019s been lent out, instead of the asset itself. It\u2019s one thing to have accepted this scenario pre-Bitcoin, but it\u2019s deeply unsettling to imagine this becoming the norm in a world where we have the opportunity to own Bitcoin on a transparent and immutable ledger.\n\nAs the coexistence of decentralized finance and TradFi becomes more of a reality, it is inevitable that the SEC will, at some point, approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. While this isn\u2019t innately bad, it\u2019s critical for the Bitcoin community to remain cognizant and committed to the reasons we\u2019re building a new financial system.\n\nWe can and should embrace legacy institutions\u2019 adoption of Bitcoin and the undoubted intertwining of traditional investment vehicles and Bitcoin. But we also need to remain vigilant about the implications of developments like spot ETFs, help market newcomers understand the novelty of Bitcoin\u2019s technology, and keep moving forward.\n\nJoseph Kelly is the CEO of Unchained, a Bitcoin financial services company he co-founded in 2016.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has a chance to end 2023 at $35,000 despite heading lower in between, veteran analyst Filbfilb believes.\n\nIn his latest interview with Cointelegraph, the co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader reveals some BTC price targets that should resonate with the long-term holder base.\n\nBitcoin faces multiple obstacles to its current uptrend, and the current cycle offers various key differences from those that came before it. It is not just the Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded fund (ETF) debacle; the entire macroeconomic environment looks markedly different from just a few years ago.\n\nFilbfilb predicts that the April 2024 block subsidy halving will nonetheless have a cathartic effect on BTC price performance. BTC/USD could even trade as high as $46,000 by that time, but losses are \u201clikely\u201d to come next.\n\nFilbfilb eyes \u201clikely\u201d BTC price dip to low $20,000 range\n\nCointelegraph (CT): On short timeframes, you recently predicted another BTC price dip to \u201ccrush the remaining hopium.\u201d Where do you see the long-term floor?\n\nFilbfilb (FF): This depends on circumstances; as we saw during the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, the floor was slightly north of $3,000, so I would expect the lows of around $16,000 seen following the FTX crash to be maintained. However, avoiding a black swan event, somewhere in the low $20,000s seems likely.\n\nCT: Do you still expect a reversal in price behavior in Q4 as miners and smart money \u201cbuy the rumor\u201d on the halving?\n\nFF: Based on the previous cycles, we have seen a contraction of new emitted supply to market in advance of the halving. Coupled by increased speculative demand, this dynamic is likely to repeat in my opinion.\n\nCT: Speaking of miners, what\u2019s your stance on price versus hash rate, considering how the latter continues to see new highs?\n\nFF: I\u2019ve not been able to attribute a direct correlation between hash rate and price.\n\nCT: What\u2019s surprised you about BTC price action this year compared to other pre-halving years?\n\nFF: There has been a failure to break the 100-week moving average thus far, which is a notable difference. In the past, this has confirmed the bull market to some extent. Timing-wise, the uptick from the 2022 lows is in line with what we have seen previously.\n\nCT: A lot has been made about the outcome of the Grayscale vs. SEC lawsuit last week. How significant do you think the news really is? Do you see a U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF approval on the horizon?\n\nFF: The SEC seemingly has a policy of \u201cdelay at all costs,\u201d which has now included unreasonable rejection. If you look at how the room is behaving \u2014 i.e., BlackRock et al. putting in a number of filings for ETFs \u2014 it would seem highly unlikely that the biggest institutional asset managers will have done little due diligence and would anticipate failure. In my humble opinion, it is a matter of \u201cwhen\u201d it will be approved rather than \u201cif.\u201d\n\nCT: You\u2019ve called U.S. inflation the \u201celephant in the room\u201d this cycle \u2014 how might this impact Bitcoin post-halving next year?\n\nFF: The longer inflation and rates remain high, the less disposable income retail has to invest. Additionally, the cost of capital has generally increased due to the risk-free rate of return being higher; this means asset allocation toward riskier assets becomes less attractive. The longer this remains the status quo, the less capital will seek investments such as Bitcoin.\n\nCT: What are your preferred noise-free metrics for tracking BTC\u2019s price?\n\nFF: On a high level, directional price momentum, coupled with market positioning (such as long/short ratios, funding rates and open interest), underpins what I am looking at in the market overall when determining shorter-term moves.\n\nCT: What\u2019s your BTC price target for the end of the year and at the 2024 halving?\n\nFF: Assuming no black swan event, around $35,000 by the end of the year and possibly as high as $46,000 some time pre-halving in Q1 2024.\n\nDOGE, XRP stand out among altcoins\n\nCT: Bitcoin aside, are you surprised by the NFT market collapse? Does it have a future?\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price metric copies move that last came before -25% FTX crash\n\nFF: I am unsurprised about the NFT collapse. I do think there is some utility in some forms of NFTs, such as for ticketing and music applications; however, massively overpriced works of \u201cart\u201d was never something I could understand.\n\nCT: Are there any altcoins in particular that you think can moon particularly hard in the new cycle?\n\nFF: At the moment, I am mostly focused on Bitcoin; altcoins tend to make their move after the halving. However, I would expect XRP (XRP) to do quite well next cycle due to its legal case with the SEC and effectively playing catch-up in market share. I\u2019d also not rule out Dogecoin (DOGE) doing well once again, particularly if Elon Musk integrates crypto into X.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "A widely followed analyst says a key Bitcoin (BTC) metric is looking strong despite the crypto market downturn.\n\nCiting an infographic from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode stating that 95% of the existing supply of Bitcoin has not moved over the past 30 days, the anonymous host of InvestAnswers tells his 447,000 YouTube subscribers that all the flagship crypto asset needs to rally is a buy-side catalyst.\n\n\u201cBreaking news: 95% of all Bitcoin has not moved in the last 30 days. So again, despite the weak market, only 5% is moving around \u2013 95% is sitting tight. And we know why\u2026\n\nBut the real magic of this, imagine there\u2019s a catalyst and imagine big money wants to jump in and buy a truckload of Bitcoin? Price will just go parabolic. And that\u2019s just economics, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nThat is kind of why I\u2019m so obsessed with Bitcoin. It\u2019s so scarce, so literally when the big institutions come, and they\u2019re fighting over that 5% and all the legacy holders are just sitting there watching. Anyway, it\u2019s a reason to be excited.\u201d\n\nThe anonymous host of InvestAnswers further says that the remaining supply of Bitcoin after accounting for long-term holders and the lost Bitcoin is also a bullish indicator.\n\n\u201cThe amount of Bitcoin that is either hodled or lost, or basically has not moved in the last five years, is nearly eight million Bitcoin. That means technically only 11 million, or thereabouts, have not.\n\nAnd in fact taking this five-year plus it doesn\u2019t include all the Bitcoin lost over the last five years or less. So we know it\u2019s just super scarce. It\u2019s mind-boggling how scarce it is.\n\nAnd I always get the question, \u2018well, if it\u2019s so scarce is that not bad?\u2019. No, it\u2019s not.

According to the theory, the fair value of Bitcoin can be estimated by the amount of energy it takes to produce it.\n\nThe model assumes that the more work that has been put into something, the more valuable it is.\n\nIn 2023, the amount of energy spent in Bitcoin mining has been on the rise as mining companies increased their capacity and share of hash rate with the installation of new ASICs and by preparing for the halving in April 2024.\n\nBitcoin price chart with energy value indicator. Source: TradingView\n\nAccording to Edwards, the Bitcoin energy value reflects its fair value.\n\nBitcoin's energy value has shown a strong correlation with Bitcoin\u2019s spot price and this suggests that the theory is at least somewhat valid. However, there are some caveats to the theory.\n\nOne limitation is that Bitcoin\u2019s energy value is not always accurate. This is because the mining energy efficiency can vary over time.\n\nRelated: Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index updated to reflect hardware distribution and hash rate increases\n\nAdditionally, the theory does not take into account other factors that can affect the price of Bitcoin, such as the market\u2019s current demand and supply and the steps taken by miners ahead of the halving next year.\n\nBitcoin looks primed for further downside\n\nBitcoin\u2019s spot liquidity data on Binance indicates that buyers are looking at the $24,600 level for support. However, the bullish momentum appears to be fading as most traders are crowding around the yearly low levels and hoping that these hold.\n\nThe liquidation levels of futures orders from CoinGlass show that buyers are expecting downside to $24,600, with smaller liquidations extending toward $23,000.\n\nNotably, the price range between $25,000 and $25,500 has the most leveraged orders in significantly high volumes, making them hot targets for traders.\n\nBitcoin futures liquidation heatmap.

        "content": "It's been a whipsaw 2023 for investor sentiment, and even though equities markets have defied expectations, a recent report from ARK Invest highlights reasons why the remainder of 2023 could present several economic challenges.\n\nARK manages $13.9 billion in assets, and its CEO, Cathie Wood, is a strong advocate for cryptocurrencies. In partnership with the European asset manager 21Shares, ARK Investment first applied for a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in June 2021. Its most recent request for a spot BTC ETF, which is currently pending review by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, was initially filed in May 2023.\n\nLong-term bullish, short-term bearish?\n\nDespite ARK\u2019s bullish view on Bitcoin, which is supported by its research on how the fusion of Bitcoin and artificial intelligence could transform corporate operations by positively impacting productivity and costs, the investment firm doesn\u2019t foresee a straightforward path for a Bitcoin bull run given the current macroeconomic conditions.\n\nIn the newsletter, ARK cites several reasons for its less-than-optimistic scenario for cryptocurrencies, including interest rates, gross domestic product (GDP) estimates, unemployment and inflation. One point is that the Federal Reserve is implementing a restrictive monetary policy for the first time since 2009, as indicated by the natural rate of interest.\n\nFederal Reserve natural rate of interest. Source: ARK Investment\n\nThe \"natural rate of interest\u201d is a theoretical rate at which the economy neither expands nor contracts. ARK explains that whenever this indicator exceeds the real federal funds policy rate, it puts pressure on lending and borrowing rates.\n\nARK anticipates that inflation will continue to slow down, which would drive up the real federal funds policy rate and increase the gap above the natural rate of interest. Essentially, the report holds a bearish macroeconomic view due to this indicator.\n\nThe analysts also focused on the divergence between real GDP (production) and GDI (income). According to the report, GDP and GDI should closely align, as income earned should equal the value of goods and services produced.\n\nHowever, the most recent data shows that real GDP is approximately 3% higher than real GDI, indicating that downward revisions in production data should be expected.\n\nAnother focal point was U.S. employment data, and the analysts note that the government has revised these figures downward for six consecutive months.\n\nU.S. nonfarm payroll revisions. Source: ARK Investment\n\nThe chart above highlights a labor market that appears weaker than initial reports indicated. The fact that the last time six consecutive months of downward revisions occurred was in 2007, just before the onset of the Great Financial Crisis, is also notable.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin short-term holders capitulate as data highlights potential generational buying opportunity\n\n\u201cStagflation\u201d is usually bearish for risk-on assets\n\nAnother bearish development to keep an eye on is \u201cstagflation.\u201d The writers highlight the reversal of the yearlong trend of price discounts driven by increased consumer spending. Referencing the Johnson Redbook Index, which encompasses over 80% of the \u201cofficial\" retail sales data compiled by the U.S. Department of Commerce, it becomes clear that total same-store sales rebounded in August for the first time in 12 months, suggesting that inflation may be exerting upward pressure.\n\nJohnson Redbook retail sales index. Source: ARK Investment\n\nThe metrics suggest that ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty could continue in the coming months. However, it does not provide a clear answer regarding how cryptocurrency investors might react if this trend confirms lower economic growth and higher inflation \u2014 a scenario typically considered highly unfavorable for risk-on assets.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "On this week's episode of \u201cMacro Markets,\u201d Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman delves into a thought-provoking discussion on the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s financial woes. Pechman opens by highlighting how the Fed is grappling with staggering losses and emphasizes a fundamental macroeconomic principle: that overall wealth cannot be universally enhanced as demand for goods and services grows.\n\nThis discrepancy underscores the challenges posed by inflation, real estate prices and the consequences of the Fed\u2019s policies. Pechman concludes that the Fed is now paying the price for its loose monetary approach during the pandemic, prompting a grim outlook for the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s finances.\n\nShifting gears, Pechman moves on to discuss European markets, with a spotlight on Novo Nordisk\u2019s remarkable ascent. The Danish pharmaceutical company has momentarily overtaken luxury goods giant LVMH as Europe\u2019s most valuable company. Pechman notes that the astonishing success of Novo Nordisk, particularly its weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, caused Denmark\u2019s gross domestic product growth forecast to be revised upward.\n\nIn a final intriguing twist, Pechman touches upon the intersection of traditional companies and cryptocurrencies as he speculates on the potential for traditional companies to adopt cryptocurrency-based revenue distribution methods through smart contracts. While he acknowledges the promise of this concept, Pechman underscores the current immaturity and complexity surrounding such endeavors, emphasizing that the sector is still in its infancy.\n\nFor additional details and the complete analysis, check out the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The next cycle top will be 21 days before or after Nov. 28, 2025 according to the model.\n\nBTC is currently in the cooling bear market phase according to this theory.\n\nThere are other theories that suggest Bitcoin market cycles have nothing to do with halvings.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s four-year cycles are just coincidences and have little to do with the halvenings,\u201d said industry observer \u201cPledditor\u201d on Sept. 5.\n\nThe cycles are more closely correlated with increases and decreases in the global M2 money supply, they said.\n\n\u201cGlobal M2 money supply has actually been having its own \u201c4-year cycles\u201d as of late, and those cycles have been reflected in most risk assets, including Bitcoin.\u201d I continue to believe that #bitcoin\u2018s 4 year cycles are just coincidences and have little to do with the halvenings.

        "content": "The team behind nonfungible token collection OnChainMonkey is shifting its entire collection of 10,000 NFTs from Ethereum to Bitcoin, in a massive undertaking expected to take several months.\n\n\"A historical transition is on the horizon as we prepare to migrate our flagship collection, OCM Genesis, from Ethereum to Bitcoin,\u201d Metagood co-founder and CEO Danny Yang said in a statement on Sept. 7.\n\nThe OnChainMonkeys were first launched in September 2021 on Ethereum, but Yang said the migration to Bitcoin Ordinals was due to its community seeing Bitcoin as offering a more secure platform for its users.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Ordinal protocol is better designed for decentralization and security than the Ethereum NFT protocol. High-value NFTs will win on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe proposal to migrate to Bitcoin was passed by 99% of OnChainMonkey tokenholders.

Spearheaded by the Ministry of Education and backed by the non-profit organisation Mi Primer Bitcoin (MPB), also known as \"My First Bitcoin,\" this visionary initiative aims to equip the nation's youth with the knowledge and skills necessary to embrace the digital currency revolution.El Salvador has been a trailblazer in adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender, and now it's taking its commitment to crypto education to the next level. The Ministry of Education is collaborating with MPB and Bitcoin Beach, a community-driven initiative in El Salvador, to integrate Bitcoin into the country's public school curriculum within the next three years.Students who complete the Bitcoin curriculum will be awarded a diploma, signifying their proficiency in Bitcoin-related concepts and applications. John Dennehy, the founder of Mi Primer Bitcoin, emphasised the program's crucial role in shaping the curriculum's content and direction.The journey toward Bitcoin enlightenment commences on September 7 with the launch of a pilot program. This inaugural phase will see 150 public school teachers from 75 institutions undergo comprehensive training to establish a solid foundation of Bitcoin knowledge. The aim is to equip educators with the necessary expertise to effectively teach their students about Bitcoin and its significance in the modern financial landscape.El Salvador's commitment to Bitcoin education aligns with its pioneering stance on crypto adoption. In June 2021, El Salvador became the first nation to embrace Bitcoin as legal tender, a historic move that captured global attention. The country's President, Nayib Bukele, has been a vocal proponent of crypto adoption and has initiated various initiatives to integrate Bitcoin into the nation's economy.John Dennehy sees the program as more than just an educational endeavour, as it's an opportunity for El Salvador to inspire the world regarding Bitcoin adoption and education. He believes that quality education is pivotal in ensuring that El Salvador's pioneering example sets a positive precedent for the global adoption of digital currencies.As El Salvador paves the way for Bitcoin literacy in its schools, it could inspire other nations to follow suit, accelerating the global understanding and acceptance of cryptos. The world eagerly observes El Salvador's progress as it takes a noteworthy stride towards a Bitcoin-savvy future."

        "title": "Gold ETF launch holds lessons for Bitcoin investors - DLNews",
        "content": "Gold\u2019s exchange-traded fund moment back in 2004 offers lessons for Bitcoin investors.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF now looks more likely than ever. Approvals and subsequent launches may share similarities with the launch of the first gold ETF, according to experts.\n\nHistory doesn\u2019t repeat but it rhymes, Joseph Hickey, founder at IntegraCess with previous experience in US ETF market making at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told DL News.\n\nThe gold listing, almost 20 years ago, was advantageously timed as central banks had just finished selling their gold at the time, Hickey said, adding that prices had bottomed and people started buying it as a hedge against policy failure.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nNow read: Larry Fink says Bitcoin is \u2018digitalising gold\u2019 in another sign BlackRock is all-in on crypto\n\nThe launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF could make the digital asset a better tool for lending or financing collateral, Hickey said, adding that it could also become more liquid and less expensive to transact.\n\n\u201cAll good things for the asset class,\u201d he said.\n\nGoing for gold\n\nThe launch of the first gold ETF provides an example of how spot ETFs can \u201cdemocratise\u201d an asset, said Jennifer Murphy, CEO and founder at Runa Digital.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nGold price after ETF launch (Runa Digital/TradingView)\n\nFollowing its launch, the first gold ETF reached more than $1 billion in assets in three days, she said, which was \u201cthe fastest ever to do so, a record it held for 18 years, and gold prices broke out and sustained a multi-year bull run.\u201d\n\nGold prices eventually doubled after its ETF launch; it took about four years.\n\nNow read: Coinbase\u2019s inscrutable fee model may backfire as Wall Street giants gun for Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe only ETF to hit that number in a shorter period of time was ProShares Bitcoin futures ETF in 2021. It attracted $1 billion in investment in just two days. The price impact on Bitcoin was negligible.\n\nBig events in crypto have been associated with peaks in crypto prices, Hickey told DL News, adding that this could play out similarly.\n\nBitcoin traded at about $60,000 when ProShares launched the first Bitcoin futures ETF in the US, reaching a record high just short of $69,000 a few days later. It\u2019s down almost 60% since.\n\nEric Balchunas and James Seyffart, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts, said Thursday that the SEC will probably want to avoid being a \u201ckingmaker\u201d again by approving one fund first. Cathie Wood also expects the commission to accept multiple applications at once.\n\nLong game\n\nThe crypto market hasn\u2019t properly valued Grayscale\u2019s win versus the US Securities and Exchange Commission last week, according to some analysts.\n\nInvestors may be dramatically underestimating the impact of US Bitcoin ETFs, Vetle Lund, a research analyst at K33 Research, formerly Arcane, said in a report Tuesday.\n\nOdds for US approval have \u201cnever been higher,\u201d Lund said, and in spite of this, Bitcoin continues to trade around or below its price when BlackRock joined the race in June.\n\nIf a spot ETF is approved, Lund expects large inflows into Bitcoin due to \u201ccompetition and simultaneous launches.\u201d Inflows into Bitcoin investment vehicles have had a strong relationship with Bitcoin price increases over the past four years, he added.\n\nStill, the expectation of big inflows may be exaggerated \u2014 it could take much longer for prices to soar.\n\nThe level of competition for spot Bitcoin ETFs may also impact inflows.\n\nProShares has the majority of the volume in the Bitcoin futures ETF market, with about $1.1 billion in assets under management. Other funds pale in comparison. VanEck and Valkyrie\u2019s products manage just $45 million and $29 million, respectively.\n\nAdam Morgan McCarthy is DL News\u2019 London-based Markets Correspondent.

        "title": "Environmental Concerns and Bitcoin: Exploring Eco-Friendly Solutions - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The meteoric rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has fascinated the financial world and beyond. However, as cryptocurrencies' popularity has grown, so have concerns about their environmental impact. The energy-intensive process of Bitcoin mining has sparked concerns about its impact on carbon emissions and environmental deterioration.\n\nIn this in-depth article, we look at the environmental concerns surrounding Bitcoin, the variables that contribute to its carbon footprint, and the inventive solutions being pursued to make cryptocurrency mining more environmentally friendly.\n\nCryptocurrency Mining's Carbon Footprint\n\nCryptocurrency mining, the process of creating new coins and verifying transactions, is based on sophisticated mathematical calculations performed by powerful computers. This method necessitates a significant amount of computer power, resulting in high energy usage. As a result, the carbon footprint of cryptocurrency mining has been scrutinized.\n\nFactors Influencing Energy Consumption\n\nSeveral factors contribute to cryptocurrency mining's high energy consumption:\n\nPoW (Proof-of-Work) Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use the PoW consensus method, in which miners compete to solve complicated mathematical puzzles. This necessitates massive amounts of computer power, which consumes enormous amounts of energy.\n\nMining Hardware: Using specialized hardware, such as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), consumes more energy. These machines are geared for mining, but they also consume a lot of power.\n\nMining Pools: To boost their chances of successfully mining a block, miners frequently join forces in mining pools. While this improves efficiency, the combined computational power increases energy consumption.\n\nGeographical Distribution: The location of mining operations is important. Cheap electricity, frequently produced from nonrenewable sources, attracts miners but contributes to a larger carbon footprint.\n\nIntegration of Renewable Energy\n\nThe use of renewable energy sources has gained traction as a solution to the environmental challenges related with bitcoin mining. Renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, provides a more environmentally friendly way to power mining operations. Some cryptocurrency miners are shifting their operations to places with ample renewable energy in order to lessen their carbon impact while retaining profitability.\n\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) Innovations\n\nPoS, an alternate consensus process, has developed as a more environmentally friendly choice than PoW. Unlike PoW, PoS does not necessitate miners solving complicated riddles. Instead, validators are chosen based on the number of coins they own and are ready to \"stake\" as collateral. Because it eliminates the need for resource-intensive computations, this method dramatically reduces energy use.\n\nMining Equipment that Saves Energy\n\nEfforts are being made to create more energy-efficient mining equipment. Some businesses are looking at using graphics processing units (GPUs) instead of power-hungry ASICs. GPUs, which are widely used in gaming and have a lower energy footprint, have the potential to make mining more sustainable.\n\nInitiatives for Carbon Offset and Sustainability\n\nSome cryptocurrency initiatives are taking proactive measures to reduce their carbon footprint. They accomplish this by investing in environmental projects or acquiring carbon credits equal to their emissions. These initiatives seek to mitigate the negative environmental impact of their operations.\n\nInitiatives Led by the Community\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is also pushing for environmentally friendly alternatives. Discussions regarding lowering energy consumption and shifting to PoS techniques are becoming more popular. Miners and fans can exchange ideas and work on sustainable mining techniques through online forums and social media platforms.\n\nAccountability and Regulations by the Government\n\nGrowing environmental concerns have generated ideas about governmental measures to ensure responsible cryptocurrency mining. Governments are looking for measures to encourage miners to use renewable energy sources or to impose energy usage caps.\n\nBalancing Responsibility and Innovation\n\nAs the bitcoin landscape evolves, it is critical to strike a balance between innovation and environmental responsibility. While cryptocurrencies have the potential to change economics and encourage technological growth, they must not come at the expense of the well-being of the world. The pursuit of environmentally friendly solutions is an important step toward ensuring that the benefits of cryptocurrencies do not jeopardize environmental sustainability.\n\nEthereum's Energy-Efficient Upgrade: A Game Changer for Blockchain\n\nAfter much anticipation, Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency, has successfully implemented a groundbreaking network upgrade, transitioning from a proof-of-work system to proof-of-stake. This transformation has had a significant environmental impact, reducing Ethereum's energy consumption by over 99%.\n\nThe move towards a proof-of-stake model is in response to growing criticism of the cryptocurrency industry's substantial energy usage. In contrast, Bitcoin, Ethereum's counterpart, is maintaining its proof-of-work system. In this system, highly specialized computers engage in a competitive process to validate transactions and generate new coins, a process commonly known as mining.\n\nNotably, the energy-intensive process of mining Bitcoin consumed 75.4 terawatt hours in 2020, surpassing the electricity consumption of entire countries like Austria or Portugal. Ethereum's shift from mining to validation represents a significant shift in its energy consumption model. Validators, responsible for verifying transactions, are rewarded with ether coins for their efforts.\n\nTo ensure the integrity of the validation process, validators are required to make a security deposit by staking a specified quantity of ether coins within the network. If a validator attempts to compromise the network's security, they risk losing their stake. Ethereum proponents argue that this penalty mechanism enhances the network's security.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts, however, continue to support the proof-of-work system, viewing it as a tried-and-tested approach to securing the network. Nonetheless, Bitcoin faces mounting scrutiny due to its energy consumption, particularly amidst global climate concerns. Consequently, some prominent Bitcoin miners are turning to renewable energy sources for their operations and attempting to reframe Bitcoin's energy use as a positive force, attracting investments to the aging national power grid.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe environmental concerns raised by Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining highlight the complicated relationship between technology, economics, and the environment. As cryptocurrencies become more widely accepted, the sector is being forced to find innovative and long-term solutions to lessen its carbon footprint.\n\nVarious paths are being studied, ranging from renewable energy integration to consensus process advances. In a world increasingly concerned with environmental well-being, the convergence of technological ingenuity with environmental consciousness will be critical in determining the future of cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "Aussie fintech prays for crypto clarity as it launches Bitcoin-backed loans - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Australian fintech firm Block Earner is charging ahead with plans to launch a crypto-backed loans product, despite staring down an upcoming court date with the financial regulator for allegedly offering financial products without a license.\n\nThe new crypto loan product allows Australian crypto investors to use crypto as collateral to borrow cash. Similarly, a Colorado-based lending platform called SALT offers crypto-backed loans to U.S. clients. The major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase once offered a similar service to its U.S. customers but shuttered it in May this year.\n\nThe initial rollout from Block Earner is expected at the end of September and will initially only allow loans using Bitcoin as collateral.\n\nBlock Earner co-founder Charlie Karaboga told Cointelegraph that the new loan products have been designed in a \u201cvery conservative way\u201d in a bid to fit neatly into an existing licensing model.\n\nAustralia's 1st Crypto-Backed Loans\n\n\n\nBorrow Australian dollars without selling your crypto, using your #Bitcoin or Ethereum as security\n\n\n\nThe first 1000 waitlist sign ups enjoy their first 30 days interest free*\n\n\n\nJoin the Waitlist https://t.co/cfbRiiuSwr\n\n\n\nThread \u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/V55z5BXfOa \u2014 Block Earner (@blockearner) September 7, 2023\n\nKaraboga\u2019s firm was burned in last November when it was sued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for allegedly offering crypto-linked fixed-yield earning products without an Australian Financial Services (AFS) license.\n\nAt the time, Karaboga lashed out against the regulator for its lack of clarity, claiming that his firm had spent considerable time and resources building out products he believed were compliant with ASIC\u2019s existing guidelines.\n\n\u201cOur position remains the same. There is no clear regulation in Australia.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike any company in the fintech ecosystem, before we launched the product we got legal opinions. We think that there was no sufficient regulation, or sufficient licenses for us to apply,\u201d Karaboga added.\n\nHowever, Charlie said that the regulatory moves against Block Earner and competitor crypto company Finder were largely reactive and likely due to the collapse of FTX in November.\n\n\"ASIC has commenced civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against fintech company Block Earner alleging it provided unlicensed financial services in relation to its crypto-asset based products...\" https://t.co/MpgKojxRRG #cryptolaw \u2014 Aaron Lane (@AMLane_au) November 23, 2022\n\n\u201cWe were impacted, unfortunately, most likely probably because we were more visible with our product compared to others, because they were using as an ancillary product, whereas we were using a core product.\u201d\n\nDespite being unaffected by the fallout of FTX, in the wake of ASIC\u2019s legal action, Karaboga said he closed the company\u2019s \u201cearn\u201d products and paid back all users.\n\nThe company appears to have learned its lesson. James Coombes, head of business at Block Earner, said the new launch wouldn\u2019t see the same fate as their Earn product, as it already fits within the rules of an Australian credit license.\n\n\u201cThere is a core difference,\u201d said Coombes. \u201cThe Earn product \u2014 there was no clear guidance on whether or not a license was required, and that\u2019s why we hold a conflicting view. Whereas this one, the clear guidance is that a license is required to provide consumer credit. So we went and got the license.\u201d\n\nHopes for clarity\n\nLooking forward, Karaboga said that faster regulatory progression in jurisdictions such as Singapore, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom will pressure the Australian government to catch up, or risk losing market share of crypto enterprises.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting within 12 to 18 months, we\u2019ll see some more clarity.\u201d\n\nKaraboga explained that because Australia is one of the wealthiest countries by way of per-capita GDP and because Australians were \u201cearly starters\u201d in the crypto industry, its citizens had become prime targets for scammers.\n\nUltimately, Karaboga asserted that domestic regulators are firmly pro-crypto and want to \u201cpush that innovation\u201d moving forward.\n\nThis is a view that was shared by Binance Australia General Manager Ben Rose, who recently told Cointelegraph he was confident that Aussie regulators would side with crypto in the long term.\n\nAs recently as Sept. 6, Coinbase listed Australia as one of its primary locations for expansion outside of the U.S.\n\nBlock Earner\u2019s Federal Court hearing is scheduled for November this year, with a decision to be handed down by January.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market \u2014 Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "title": "NFT Community OnChainMonkey Spends Over $1 Million USD to Migrate the Entire Digital Art Collection from ... - Business Wire",
        "content": "REDMOND, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Metagood, the creators of OnChainMonkey (OCM), are the first to move a 10,000 NFT collection, OCM Genesis, from Ethereum, the nominal home of smart contracts, to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, the most decentralized and secure blockchain. The OCM DAO voted to financially subsidize some of the substantial cost of the large migration from Ethereum to Bitcoin.\n\nOn 30 August 2023, the OCM team proposed subsidizing the cost of this migration and making it free for all OCM Genesis NFT holders with a Bitcoin Badge. The Bitcoin Badge was rewarded to OCM holders who participated in missions that took about a year to complete.\n\nThe DAO proposal will award a subsidy of 350 ETH (approximately USD $570,787 currently) for the migration to Genesis, and reached a quorum of 2,000 votes within 24 hours and finished with over 4,700 votes cast in favor of the proposal. This is the highest number of votes any DAO proposal has received within 24 hours since OCM\u2019s DAO was founded in 2021. The proposal had nearly unanimous support, with 99% of voters supporting the migration to Bitcoin.\n\nThe vote was not assured and involved an education campaign on Bitcoin Ordinals and the new technical development of Recursive Inscriptions led by the Metagood leadership team, who proposed the migration idea and wrote the DAO proposal.\n\nImportantly, the OCM community subsidy doesn't cover all of the costs of migration, which amount to around $1M. Metagood is covering the rest of the cost for their community of holders.\n\n\u201cOur OCM community has conviction in our move to Bitcoin,\" said Metagood CEO and co-founder and OCM Genesis Collection creator Danny Yang. \"We have been involved with Ordinals since the beginning of the year, and the OCM community, in particular, has a great understanding of the potential and benefits of the migration to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\"A historical transition is on the horizon as we prepare to migrate our flagship collection, OCM Genesis, from Ethereum to Bitcoin. Inscribed in early February in inscription #20219, Genesis represents our firm belief in the promising future that awaits digital artifacts on Bitcoin,\u201d said Metagood co-founder and COO Amanda Terry. \u201cIt is remarkable that the DAO almost unanimously voted for the Ordinals technology that only emerged in February this year.\u201d\n\nIn truth, part of the vote likely reflects the faith in Metagood and OCM co-founder Danny Yang, who has been building on Bitcoin since founding Maicoin, his first Bitcoin company, in 2013 (the largest cryptocurrency company in Taiwan today), and early in building on Ordinals. Yang helped pioneer recursive inscriptions, creating 3D generative art on Bitcoin with the OCM Dimensions collection. The recursive inscription technology gives Bitcoin new powers, previously thought impossible without changing Bitcoin\u2019s core protocol. Now, complex programs can be stored and run from the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nRecursion and other features of Ordinals allow for an on-chain kind of NFTs referred to as Digital Artifacts. These are more secure and decentralized NFTs.\n\n\u201cA migration of this order of magnitude is a monumental milestone for our OCM Community and a first-of-its-kind migration and upgrade for a 10K collection,\" mentioned Danny Yang. \"The Genesis collection will have a ton of innovative features to its name and be on Block 9 Satoshis (sats), the first sats in circulation. They will be in sequential order, matching the sats, and have clear collection provenance on Bitcoin, and provenance going back to their origin on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nYang said further: \u201cIn the past, other projects have been paid a substantial amount of money to move to another blockchain. We are doing the opposite. We are so convinced in our move that we are spending more than $1M of our own resources to make the move to Bitcoin and in an important and innovative way.\u201d\n\nClearly, OCM DAO members believe in this truly decentralized future for digital assets on Bitcoin. OnChainMonkey will celebrate its 2 year anniversary of the launch of its Genesis collection on Ethereum this Monday, September 11.\n\nAbout OnChainMonkey\n\nOnChainMonkey, created by Metagood, is a pioneering digital art collection. It is the first NFT profile pic collection created on-chain in a single transaction on Ethereum in 2021. In 2023, OnChainMonkey made history again, becoming the first 10k collection inscribed on Bitcoin in inscription 20219. The collection of 10,000 generative art NFTs is led by an experienced team, including Danny Yang, who founded Taiwan\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Maicoin; Amanda Terry, who served as a digital media business development executive at Twitter and NBC; and Bill Tai, a legendary VC who was the first investor in Zoom and early investor in Canva, Dapper Labs as well as over 20 companies that have become publicly listed. The OnChainMonkey community is building businesses in Web3 and making real world impact.

        "content": "Sustainable bitcoin miner Iris Energy reported receiving $2.3 million in power credits last month, primarily driven by voluntary curtailment at its Childress site in Texas during peak demand.\n\nThe company mined 410 bitcoin, creating a revenue of $11.4 million, according to its latest investor update for August. It spent $6.6 million on electricity, which was reduced to $4.3 million due to the credits.\n\nThis resulted in a profit of $7.1 million, averaging out at $17,300 profit per bitcoin.\n\nMining bitcoin with renewable energy\n\nAround 97% of the power used for its mining operations come directly from renewable energy sources, while the remaining 3% come via renewable energy credits.\n\nIris Energy situates its mining operations near renewable energy sources, such as hydro power stations. In the case of its Canal Flats operation, it absorbs some of the power station's excess capacity.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"Energy market volatility (e.g. lots of wind, solar, weather events) and our tech stack then dynamically trading bitcoin mining profitability against electricity market pricing. I.e. automatically pivoting between highest and best use of our power,\" said Iris Energy co-founder and co-CEO Daniel Roberts, in response to a query about the energy costs on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nThe power credits were received as part of a state program in Texas that offers energy credits to bitcoin miners to lower their energy use during periods of congestion on the grid. Rival bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms received $31.7 million for similarly lowerering its usage in August.\n\nLast month, Iris Energy also announced an initial purchase of 248 NVIDIA artificial intelligence H100 GPUs for around $10 million. While bitcoin mining remains its core operation, the company said next-generation data centers serving burgeoning computing markets like generative AI represent an additional opportunity.\n\nAverage bitcoin miner revenue per TH/s has fallen 40% since May, according to The Block's data dashboard \u2014 coinciding with a fall in the price of bitcoin and the increasing total hashrate on the network."

        "content": "Share:\n\nIf Bitcoin price slips below the $24,995 key support level, the odds of a bearish breakdown increase.\n\nEthereum price could fall below the $1,621 level over the weekend as investor aggression reduces.\n\nRipple price could fall back into the bearish technical formation with prospects for an 8% slump to $0.4600.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is trading without a directional bias, closing the week in a consolidation mode while extending the same aura to Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices. The outlook leaves investors cautious and the circumspect could extend into the weekend, which is known for low trading volume.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC could revisit $21,000 as sell signals multiply ahead of US CPI.\n\nBitcoin price lacks directional bias, make-or-break support nearby\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is moving west, consolidating within a narrow range after breaking below a crucial support level during the August 17 crash. With weekends known to be rather lulled, the odds of a move north are slim unless large holders act.\n\nThe $24,995 support level is a \u2018make-or-break\u2019 for Bitcoin price. A decisive break below would send BTC to the psychological $24,000 and mark a bearish shift in trend. In the dire case, seller momentum could see the king of crypto hit $21,915, levels last seen around mid-March.\n\nBoth the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator and the RSI recently gave buy signals. The RSI rose out of oversold territory at the end of August and the MACD line crossed above its signal line in negative territory at the same time. Despite these signals only reflecting a brief dead-cat bounce in price that quickly fell back at the start of September, there is still a possibility of a recovery evolving.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA resurgence by the bulls could provide such an impetus for Bitcoin price, fueling a recovery to the upside. Such a move could send BTC above the 200-, 50-, and eventually the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $27,066, $27,414, and $27,763 levels before ultimately restoring above the support offered by the ascending trendline at $29,692.\n\nIn a highly ambitious case, Bitcoin price could foray into the zone above the psychological $30,000 before tagging $31,518. While the possibility for a northbound move remains bleak in the near term, it would constitute a 20% climb above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin all-time high in 2025? BTC price idea reveals 'bull run launch\u2019\n\nEthereum price tests the $1,621 support\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is testing the $1,621 support level, which is shaky ground, considering momentum is fading.\n\nA drop below this buyer congestion level with a lot of uncollected liquidity hanging beneath could see ETH test the $1,529 support level.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, revitalized momentum among bulls could see Ethereum price pivot at $1,621 before forging north to the 50-day EMA at $1,734. The ascension could extend, possibly reaching the area where the 200- and 100-day EMAs appear to converge at $1,762 and $1,773, respectively.\n\nWith the right momentum, inspired by a strong move by Bitcoin, the price could see Ethereum price hit $1,841, an area last tested on August 15.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whales accumulate ETH as researchers explore scaling beyond EIP-4844.\n\nRipple price breaks out from a bearish trend, decisive?\n\nRipple (XRP) price has broken out from a descending parallel channel after the exhaustion blow-off move lower on August 17. These are both bullish signs that the downtrend has finished. Further confirmation would be provided should the remittance token record a daily candlestick close above the 200-day EMA at $0.5233.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nIf sidelined investors or late buyers come in, the increased buying momentum could see Ripple price tag, or in a highly bullish case, overcome the resistance presented by the confluence resistance area between the 100-day and 50-day EMAs at $0.5547 and $0.5580 levels respectively.\n\nOvercoming these hurdles could clear the way for Ripple price to reach the psychological $0.7000 level. This would indicate a 15% drop.\n\nFrom a bearish perspective, there is still a risk Ripple price could slip back below the upper boundary of the descending channel and potentially extend to the July 13 lows around $0.4600. This would represent an 8% fall. In a dire case, Ripple price could extend to the midline of the bearish technical formation at $0.4191.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price likely to slump as pro-XRP attorney Deaton analyzes the Howey memo and Hinman speech"

        "content": "Bitcoin was struggling to hold some gains on Friday. All eyes are set on India's G-20 presidency, where crypto regulations are likely to be discussed. Just banning cryptocurrency won't eliminate its risks, a joint policy roadmap published by global standard setters Thursday said.\n\n\n\nA joint policy paper on crypto published by the IMF and FSB warned jurisdictions against implementing blanket bans to mitigate risks associated with the sector, and recommended targeted restrictions and sound monetary policy instead. Targeted restrictions might come in handy for emerging economies in particular, it said.\n\n\n\nBitcoin posted smart gains on Friday as the largest crypto token rose more than 2 per cent to regain $26,300-levels. Its largest peer, Ethereum, also moved about a per cent up to hover around $1,650-mark. Price action in the altcoins remained on the positive lines with mild gains.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's value is currently trading around the $26,200 level. This positive price movement might be because of a paper that came out yesterday from the IMF and the G20\u2019s Financial Stability Board, said Edul Patel, CEO & Co-Founder at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"The paper said that banning all cryptocurrencies wouldn't work well in the long term and suggested using targeted restrictions and a comprehensive monetary strategy instead. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trading above the $1600 level,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading slightly higher on Friday. However, the gains were capped. Other than Bitcoin, Solana gained about 2 per cent. BNB, Polkadot and Litecoin added about a per cent each. Among the losers, Toncoin and Polygon shed about 2 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising to $1.05 trillion-mark, as it gained more than one per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped as much as 7 per cent to $24.98 billion.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has picked up for the second consecutive day. The fear and greed index also jumped 5 points since yesterday and is currently in the fear zone with a score of 46/100. Most of the top 10 cryptos by market capitalization are trading in the green, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\n\n\"The investor sentiment seems to have been slightly boosted after news about JPMorgan exploring a blockchain-based payment and settlement system,\" he added. \"The much-awaited synthesis paper that has been jointly prepared by FSB and IMF was published for the public yesterday, which underlines the importance of a global regulatory framework.\"\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nEthereum is currently attempting a rebound after failing to break the $1,675 resistance level.After recording short-term gains last month, the asset has declined 9.2% since mid-August.The price action has been registering short line candles in the daily chart, indicating that ETH will continue moving sideways in medium term.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-ETH\n\n\n\nThe asset is currently trading below its 20-day moving average of $1,670 which acts as an immediate resistance level.Its RSI reading is currently at 40, slightly in oversold territory.If ETH is unable to break through the $1,700 barrier this week, the price may consolidate around $1,650 levels for a while.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,625,$1,585\n\nResistance: $1,670, $1,700, $1,735\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

It has had some technical issues along the way, and on-the-ground adoption has been limited\u2014but tourism in the country has surged in response.\n\nSince launching in 2021, My First Bitcoin has already taught 25,000 in-person Salvadoran students. Last year, the non-profit developed a 10-week Bitcoin Diploma that is \u201copen-source\u201d\u2014meaning its contents are fully available and viewable online. Not unlike what colleges and universities have done with massive open online courses, or MOOCs.\n\nHaving already been used to help educate students across the nation, the Bitcoin Diploma was later used to teach staff from the Ministry of Education about Bitcoin and is now being used to train teachers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 187-page student workbook features economic education, touching on subjects like the role of money, its evolution, and the \u201cdark side of fiat.\u201d It includes English, German, Korean, and Spanish translations.\n\nThe workbook\u2019s contents echo themes from the famous Bitcoin book \"The Bitcoin Standard,\" whose author Saifedean Ammous now advises El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. \u201cDebasement of currency occurs when the government reduces the value of its currency by increasing the money supply or decreasing the quality of the currency,\u201d reads a passage in chapter 3.\n\nDennehy clarified that Ammous made no direct contributions to the course material, which was devised by a \u201csmall team of teachers\u201d in El Salvador and the United States. However, a version of the Diploma was once reviewed by popular Bitcoin and Lightning developer Giacomo Zucco.\n\n\u201cIt's been a bumpy road to get there but throughout the past two years the students have been extremely receptive,\u201d wrote Dennehy.\n\nMy First Bitcoin currently works with grassroots education initiatives in over 20 countries, including multiple states in the US, Canada, the UK, Hong Kong, Guatemala, Cuba, and others.\n\nRegarding state education, Dennehy said that two additional Latin American governments have already reached out to My First Bitcoin over the past month for potential collaboration on Bitcoin education.\n\nFurthermore, the non-profit is in early-stage collaboration with a state government in Mexico for a pilot teaching 250 students about Bitcoin, with help from Bitcoin-supportive senator Indria Kempis Martinez.\n\n\u201cWe expect to continue to expand at a rapid pace,\u201d said Dennehy. \u201cEl Salvador is the focus, but the mission is the world.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "MicroStrategy to avoid reporting massive Bitcoin loss\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) is set to change how it reports its bitcoin (BTC) holdings each quarter, as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has voted to alter the crypto reporting rules.\n\nOverall, the move is seen as a positive step for the crypto market and will provide investors with more transparency. Currently, cryptocurrencies are treated as intangible assets, resulting in conservative accounting that dings company earnings when crypto prices drop.\n\nThe new changes will allow MicroStrategy to avoid recognizing impairment losses if the price of bitcoin drops during a quarter. Since initiating its bitcoin acquisition strategy in August 2020, the Virginia-based business intelligence firm has reported $2.23 billion in cumulative impairment losses. The largest impairment loss of $917.8 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nThese losses have sometimes given the impression that the company\u2019s inherent value was negatively affected, even when it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe move comes after the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has voted to allow companies to use fair-value accounting, enabling them to immediately show gains and losses on their income statements. This means that businesses can recognize recoveries in value after price declines, which is an improvement over the current practice.\n\nThe FASB is expected to formally approve the final language of this change later this year, and companies can then adopt the new standards.\n\nMichael Saylor, Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, tweeted that this rule update eliminates a major impediment to corporate adoption of bitcoin as a treasury asset. While the FASB has stated that the new rules will take effect as soon as 2025, companies will have the option to apply them earlier, and MicroStrategy is expected to do so.\n\nMicroStrategy has long urged that US accounting standards should be reconsidered to accommodate companies that hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. Currently, MicroStrategy reports its cryptocurrency holdings as intangible assets, which are then impaired if the value dips. However, the value can never be revised upward if the crypto price increases.\n\nThe analytics software maker, led by bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, has taken advantage of any price drop in Bitcoin to continue beefing up its investment in the world\u2019s most-traded cryptocurrency.\n\nThis strategy, however, turned out to be a risky gamble. By the end of Q1 2022, MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings were valued at approximately $5.9 billion. However, since then, the value has declined by around 22%. Throughout its venture into Bitcoin starting in 2020, MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price has frequently mirrored the fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s price."

The Swiss city, which also runs the initiative called Plan \u20bf, has previously recognized BTC, USDT, and LVGA as \u201cde facto\u201d legal tender, with more than 400 merchants accepting all these three cryptocurrencies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe started to discuss with Lugano and its technical partner NOKU in 2022, with the purpose to explore ways to integrate the Internet Computer with the MyLugano app,\u201d DFINITY Foundation\u2019s founder and chief scientist Dominic Williams told Decrypt. \u201cIt naturally made sense that as a home for blockchain that the Internet Computer played a role in the city. Today, we are proud to launch ckBTC on the MyLugano app.\u201d\n\nFirst introduced in April this year, ckBTC uses open-source, verifiable smart contracts and is described as a more cryptographically secure alternative to existing cross-chain solutions such as bridges and wrapped Bitcoin. The developers claim that by removing the dangers of third-party intermediaries and the hacking risks related to bridges, ckBTC is bringing true decentralization to DeFi and the broader blockchain space.\n\nAccording to Williams, it also maximizes the Web3 experience of Bitcoin, making it easy to use and transact at web speed and neglectable fees.\n\n\u201cckBTC is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, and because it lives on ICP, you can transact it fast and cheap,\u201d Williams told Decrypt. \u201cAt the protocol level, ckBTC is seamlessly woven into the fabric of the Bitcoin network, creating a dynamic interplay that redefines transactional efficiency.\u201d\n\nDFINITY unveils $1 million grant fund for Lugano-based startups\n\nAs part of the collaboration, the DFINITY Foundation is launching a $1 million grant fund for Lugano-based blockchain startups. The fund will support projects working on decentralized applications that run on ICP and leverage ckBTC to create open internet services that have the potential to benefit the global community.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cConsidering its positioning as one of the fastest growing crypto hubs in the world, Lugano is driving innovation in the field of blockchain technology,\u201d Williams told Decrypt. \"These grants are intended to assist these startups in their efforts to improve, advocate for, and expand upon the Internet Computer platform.\u201d\n\nAccording to Williams, the grants will be awarded in $5,000, $25,000 and $100,000 bands, with the $100,000 grants generally reserved as a follow-on to a smaller grant.\n\n\u201cThis partnership is an excellent example of our new technology combined with Lugano\u2019s forward thinking in regard to blockchain technology to accelerate the mass adoption of Web3,\u201d he stated, adding that Lugano is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing blockchain hubs with \u201cmany exciting things happening.\u201d"

        "content": "In a recent series of tweets, Vetle Lunde, Senior Analyst at K33 Research, delved deep into the potential ramifications of the US Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs. Lunde\u2019s analysis suggests that the broader market might be significantly underestimating the transformative power of these financial instruments.\n\nLunde\u2019s assertion is rooted in five core reasons. He began with a bold proclamation: \u201cThe market is wrong \u2013 and dramatically underestimates the impact of US BTC ETFs (and ETH futures-based ETFs).\u201d\n\nWhy The Market Is Wrong On Bitcoin\n\nFirstly, Lunde believes that the current climate is ripe for the approval of US spot ETFs, suggesting that the odds have never been more favorable. As NewsBTC reported, Bloomberg experts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart recently raised their Bitcoin spot ETF approval odds following the Grayscale judgment to 75% this year, 95% by the end of 2024.\n\nSecondly, Lunde pointed out that BTC price has retraced to pre-BlackRock announcement levels. The third reason revolves around the potential competition and the simultaneous launches of multiple US spot ETFs. Lunde anticipates that these, if approved, could lead to robust inflows, potentially surpassing the initial trading days of both BITO and Purpose.\n\nFor context, he highlighted that Purpose saw inflows of 11,141 BTC, and in its wake, subsequent ETF launches in Canada resulted in a whopping 58,000 BTC worth of inflows within a mere four months. Given the vastness of the US market compared to Canada, the inflow potential is considerably higher.\n\nThe fourth reason Lunde presented is based on historical data from the past four years. He emphasized a noticeable correlation between strong BTC investment vehicle inflows and appreciating BTC prices. This relationship becomes even more pronounced during periods of extreme inflows, which have historically contributed to significant market uplifts.\n\nThe last crucial point for Lunde is that on August 17 the market got rid of from excess leverage, as NewsBTC reported.\n\nBy The Numbers\n\nIn conclusion, the research firm posits that US BTC spot ETFs could see at least 30,000 BTC worth of inflows in their first 10 days. Over a span of four months, the combined inflows into BTC investment vehicles could range between 70,000 to 100,000 BTC, driven by US spot ETFs and growing inflows to ETPs in other countries.\n\nBased on these flow assumptions and data from the past four years, Lunde suggests a potential 66% BTC rally, targeting a price of $42,000. However, he also cautioned that this projection is based on a \u201cna\u00efve assumption\u201d and doesn\u2019t account for other market-moving events.\n\nAt press time, BTC traded at $25,865.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

In the past week, the price has gone up by 12.96%, but in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has only gone up by 1.63%.\n\nHowever, the future of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is uncertain. While some analysts believe that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could go up in price, others have a bearish outlook about it.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Releases New Guide to Replace Outdated Yellow Paper\n\nEthereum (ETH) has created a new guide, called Ethereum EELS. It is replacing the old Yellow Paper, which is not up-to-date. The EELS is easy to use, and has all the latest information about Ethereum (ETH).\n\nThe EELS provides a complete guide to how Ethereum (ETH) works at every stage. This is important because previous Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) only suggested changes, without explaining how they would fit into the existing Ethereum (ETH) framework.\n\nAs of now, Ethereum's (ETH) price is $1,646.42. While Ethereum (ETH) has grown by 2.98% in the past week, it has declined by 1.13% in the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) is still 66.34% below its all-time high of $4,891.70.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG)\n\nThe average vacation rental owner earns $24,000 per year. But what if you could start earning passive income from vacation rentals without having to own, or manage a property? With Everlodge, you can do just that.\n\nEverlodge is a new platform that makes it easy to invest in vacation rentals. It is like Airbnb, but instead of renting out your own home, you can buy a share of a vacation rental for just $100, using Web3. The platform has already sold over 27 million tokens, and is valued at $0.012.\n\nELDG uses blockchain technology to make the process secure, and transparent. Each vacation rental is represented by a non-fungible token (NFT). NFTs are special digital items that you can buy and sell. When you buy an NFT, you are buying a share of the vacation rental.\n\nAdditionally, the marketplace will let you buy, sell, and invest in small parts of real estate properties, like villas, homes, and hotels. You can browse listings, purchase your vacation home, and start generating income, all in one place.\n\nThe platform will also have a launchpad where developers can raise money from the ELDG community. The Rewards Club will give members free stays at Everlodge properties. This is a great way to enjoy vacation rentals without having to pay full price. Members can also resell their free stays for extra income.\n\nFinally, co-owners of the properties can use their property-backed NFTs as collateral for loans. Thus, they can borrow money against the value of their property.\n\nFind out more about the Everlodge (ELDG)\n\nWebsite: https://www.everlodge.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/everlodge\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis is an advertorial.

        "title": "The Fate of Bitcoin After the Last Halving - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nBitcoin\u2019s enigmatic creation story and decentralized nature have made it a subject of intense scrutiny and speculation. One such notable event that has piqued the interest of investors and critics alike is the Bitcoin \u201chalving,\u201d where the rewards for mining new blocks are halved. The last such event occurred in 2020, and it brought with it a wave of questions, hypotheses, and projections. The mechanics of halving intersect with the broader macroeconomic concepts of supply and demand, creating a unique case study for those interested in financial markets. From hobbyist miners to institutional investors, the implications of this halving event are far-reaching, affecting not only the value of Bitcoin but also the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market as a whole. This article aims to explore the fate of Bitcoin following this recent halving, investigating its impact on price behavior, mining sustainability, and investor sentiment.\n\nThe Basics of Halving\n\nWhat is Halving?\n\nHalving is an event coded into the Bitcoin algorithm that reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half. Initially, miners received 50 Bitcoins per block. The rewards have halved three times: first to 25, then to 12.5, and finally to 6.25 Bitcoins as of the 2020 halving.\n\nThe Role of Scarcity\n\nBitcoin was designed to mimic precious resources like gold that have a limited supply. Halving contributes to this scarcity, theoretically making each Bitcoin more valuable as the reward for mining new blocks decreases.\n\nThe Psychological Factor\n\nBeyond the mathematical implications of reducing the mining reward, the halving events also exert a psychological impact on the market. The anticipation leading up to each halving often generates media buzz, drawing in new investors and speculators looking to capitalize on price fluctuations. This increased attention can further amplify demand, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts that increases Bitcoin\u2019s value temporarily, even if fundamentals may not fully support such a surge.\n\nIn the grand scheme of Bitcoin\u2019s history, each halving event has served as a crucial milestone, shedding light on the cryptocurrency\u2019s resilience, market dynamics, and the ever-evolving interplay between supply and demand.\n\nImpact on Bitcoin\u2019s Value\n\nHistorical Trends\n\nTraditionally, Bitcoin\u2019s price has seen a considerable uptick after each halving event. This could be due to the scarcity factor kicking in or investor sentiment, seeing the event as a bullish sign.\n\nPost-2020 Trends\n\nAfter the 2020 halving, Bitcoin experienced a substantial surge in price, briefly touching the $60,000 mark. However, it has seen some volatility, which is not uncommon for cryptocurrencies.\n\nReading the Crypto Charts\n\nIf you are using trading platforms like easyMarket, understanding how to read crypto charts is crucial. A comprehensive guide on this subject would include learning about candlestick patterns, moving averages, and volume indicators. Knowing these can greatly aid in making informed decisions in a volatile market.\n\nRisks and Considerations\n\nMining Costs\n\nOne significant consequence of halving is the increased cost of mining. As the rewards diminish, miners need more efficient hardware and cheaper electricity to maintain profitability.\n\nMarket Speculation\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is highly speculative. While historical trends have been optimistic post-halving, there is no guarantee that this pattern will continue indefinitely.\n\nFuture Predictions\n\nThe Next Halving\n\nThe next halving is expected to happen in 2024 and will reduce the mining reward to 3.125 Bitcoins per block. It\u2019s still too early to say definitively what impact this will have, but it\u2019s something investors are already keeping an eye on.\n\nLong-term Viability\n\nThe success of Bitcoin\u2019s model depends on various factors including technological improvements, mainstream adoption, and regulatory developments. While no one can predict the future, understanding the underlying mechanics and market indicators can go a long way in making informed investment choices.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe last Bitcoin halving in 2020 has had a pronounced impact on the cryptocurrency\u2019s value and the broader market. While the event has traditionally been seen as a bullish indicator, it brings along increased mining costs and market volatility. Therefore, traders and investors should equip themselves with the necessary tools and knowledge, such as how to read crypto charts, to navigate this complex landscape. Utilizing reliable trading platforms like easyMarkets can provide valuable resources for both beginners and seasoned traders looking to make informed decisions.\n\nThe fate of Bitcoin post-halving is subject to a myriad of factors, both predictable and unpredictable. Some of these include regulatory changes, technological advancements, and shifts in investor sentiment. Nonetheless, its historical resilience and adaptability give many a positive outlook on its future potential, making it a compelling subject for ongoing study and investment. With the right tools and information at hand, the risk-reward equation could tilt in favor of those who are well-prepared and well-informed."

        "content": "And while Canadian authorities moved against this funding source with the same alacrity and hammer-like intensity they displayed with the dollar-denominated fundraising sites, St. Louis was far more successful in distributing the money he raised to its intended recipients. According to the Rouleau Report, he managed to distribute 14.6 Bitcoin, or approximately $800,000, to the truckers. The remaining 6.7 Bitcoin, or less than $300,000, was eventually seized by police. (Note how the bulk of the left-hand orange line flows into the blue \u201cAvailable to protestors\u201d line on the chart\u2019s right side.)\n\nAs a recent documentary by the Reason Foundation explains, \u201cFinancial censorship, or cutting off access to the global banking system, is one of the most powerful tools that governments have for punishing people.\u201d The actions of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau government\u2019s during the convoy certainly meet the definition of financial censorship. Virtually anyone who tried to make a donation in Canadian legal tender via electronic means found their efforts ultimately stymied. At the same time, St. Louis\u2019 experience with Bitcoin suggests that cryptocurrencies may offer far greater personal privacy and, accordingly, stronger resistance to interference by third parties \u2013 including governments intent on exercising politically motivated financial censorship.\n\nHere is what you need to know about how it happened. And why Ottawa wants to make sure it never happens again.\n\nBitcoin for Beginners\n\nThe world\u2019s first cryptocurrency was created by an unknown person or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. \u201cWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party,\u201d Satoshi wrote in the seminal document Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\n\nBitcoin and newer cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin or Dogecoin rely on a foundational technology called blockchain. This is effectively a digital ledger, similar to the records of a banking statement, that allows a digital currency to fulfill the role of traditional money by acting as a unit of exchange. The necessary security is provided through advanced encryption \u2013 conversion of all data from a readable into an encoded form \u2013 hence the \u201ccrypto\u201d in cryptocurrencies.\n\nBlockchain has two key features. First, unlike traditional centralized databases, it exists on many computers, or nodes, around the globe. In this way it cannot be shut down; no single entity has control over it. Second, it is immutable. Every time a transaction occurs, it is recorded in an ever-lengthening chain of information blocks that cannot be tampered with. This chaining is done through a \u201cconsensus mechanism,\u201d which verifies the validity and security of any transaction. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, the consensus mechanism operates without the need for a trusted intermediary, such as a bank, to oversee the process.\n\nSince Bitcoins are electronic, they can reside in a trading platform similar to how stocks and bonds are bought and sold. They can also be held in a crypto \u201cwallet.\u201d A crypto wallet is simply a place that holds the private digital key (similar to a login ID and password) necessary to access and manage a user\u2019s cryptocurrency. While this wallet can be digital, it can also be as rudimentary as a piece of paper printed with the key, or a \u201cseed phrase\u201d \u2013 25 random words that can be used to recover the key. A wallet can also be a special physical device with sophisticated tamper-proof security features, or a digital application (either online or locally installed) that holds the key and is used to interact with the cryptocurrency.\n\nAnother important aspect of cryptocurrencies is how they are created. Bitcoins are \u201cmined\u201d rather than minted or printed. Bitcoin miners compete with each other to solve the complex cryptography problems required to maintain the consensus mechanism, and are rewarded for their effort with new Bitcoin. Anyone can become a miner, as long as he or she has the necessary computer hardware and a data centre with a sufficiently robust air conditioning system to deal with the heat generated by all that computing effort. Financial success in mining thus becomes a race between the Bitcoin the miner earns and their electricity bill.\n\nHow to Seize Crypto \u2013 Simple and Advanced Techniques\n\nIf you hold your Bitcoin in a trading platform or online application wallet, your wallet is technically controlled by the third party that manages that platform or app. This unfortunately means a government can issue an order that the funds be blocked or transferred to another, government-controlled wallet address. In this sense, Bitcoin is no different from funds held in ordinary bank accounts or on the crowdfunding platforms Ottawa froze during last year\u2019s imposition of the Emergencies Act."

        "title": "The Fintech Owner Accused of Laundering Drug Money in Huge Bitcoin Scheme - BNN Bloomberg",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A fintech owner in London is facing allegations that he helped notorious drug traffickers attempt to launder hundreds of millions of euros through a crypto exchange platform on a scale rarely seen by European prosecutors.\n\nAuthorities in Belgium are seeking the extradition of Caio Marchesani from the UK as part of their effort to dismantle a transnational gang. They accuse the 38-year-old Italian of \u201cknowingly and intentionally\u201d hoarding piles of cash for Sergio Roberto De Carvalho, a Brazilian described by Interpol as one of the world\u2019s most wanted kingpins before his arrest in 2022, and managing crypto accounts on behalf of Flor Bressers, a Belgian national known as the \u201cfinger cutter,\u201d who was also nabbed last year.\n\nMarchesani owns Trans-Fast Remittance, a payments business regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. He was arrested in May at Heathrow Airport.\n\nThe case puts the British financial-technology scene under fresh scrutiny amid fears that its weak controls are enabling the movement of illicit funds around the world. Transparency International UK has called for tougher supervision after finding that more than one-third of UK-licensed electronic-money institutions show red flags. In response to Bloomberg queries, the FCA said it is \u201cengaging\u201d with Trans-Fast \u201cas part of our ongoing supervisory work, including in relation to these matters.\u201d\n\nThe Belgian investigation kicked off three years ago after Dutch customs officials seized more than 12 tonnes of cocaine, worth more than \u20ac260 million ($283 million), from containers at Europe\u2019s busiest port, Rotterdam. Authorities traced the haul to Bressers and De Carvalho, later zeroing in on Marchesani after a breakthrough in decoding encrypted communications.\n\nIn all, 33 suspects have been identified, linked to countries including Brazil, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and France \u2014 five are in pretrial detention, with Bressers and De Carvalho in Belgium and Marchesani in the UK.\n\nThe case against Marchesani came to light at a series of extradition hearings in London. A request for bail was turned down by the court after prosecutors described him as a flight risk. The judge intends to rule on the extradition later in September.\n\n\u2018Large Cash Sums\u2019\n\nMarchesani managed 14 Binance accounts for Bressers, according to Belgian prosecutors. He also held cash for De Carvalho, charging suspiciously high rates of as much as 9% for transferring funds, the prosecutors said.\n\nAs many as 85% of Trans-Fast customers were Brazilian, filings from a separate employment case show. A recorded company telephone message says it is currently offline and unable to process orders.\n\nThe underground network is alleged to have essentially combined new technology with hawala, a centuries-old money transfer system practiced in regions including the Middle East, where international and local remittances are paid largely based on trust. Its use of crypto currencies increased after the Covid pandemic made cash deliveries much harder, according to Belgium prosecutors. Binance provided law enforcement with \u201cpractical operational assistance\u201d in relation to the investigation, a spokesperson for the crypto-trading platform said.\n\nAmanda Bostock, a lawyer acting for Belgium authorities, described Marchesani as \u201ca dark banker who receives money and moves it around at the will of the criminal organization in order to disguise its origins.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery large cash sums\u201d protected by a round-the-clock guard were said to have been stored at an apartment Marchesani rented near the US embassy in south London, prosecutors said. He was found with some \u00a31.5 million ($1.9 million) of cryptoassets. The electronic wallet holding them was subsequently frozen.\n\nMarchesani\u2019s lawyers deny the allegations. The money for Marchesani\u2019s bail surety had legitimate origins from a UK company with a \u201cthriving business focused on healthy eating in a cafe setting,\u201d the judge said in a reference to Acai Berry Foods Ltd. of which Marchesani is the chief financial officer and a 50% shareholder. The prosecution\u2019s case has \u201cfalse, vague, ambiguous or inaccurate particulars,\u201d his lawyers at Mishcon de Reya said. \u201cWhat is clear however, is that none of the allegations against him relate to any of his business interests in the UK.\u201d\n\nMarchesani, who interned at Deutsche Bank from October 2013 to January 2014, wanted to convert Trans-Fast into an online bank according the employment case tribunal ruling. Companies House filings from August show another owner added to the registry.\n\n\u2018Everything is Criminal\u2019\n\nIn an encrypted chat decoded by authorities, Marchesani, using the moniker \u2018Greysmith,\u2019 asked, \u201cfriend, this ted 60 is for crime or normal?\u201d to which \u2018Lucrativeherb\u2019, a pseudonym prosecutors say was used by De Carvalho, replied, \u201cNormal. Everything is criminal,\u201d the Belgian law enforcers alleged. The judgment did not mention what \u2018ted 60\u2019 referred to. In another message, Marchesani is alleged to have said: \u201conly risk is when the police are around.\u201d\n\nBressers, who has a masters in criminology, was wanted on charges including kidnapping, gang drug trafficking and theft, and was arrested in February 2022 in Zurich. De Carvalho was nabbed in Hungary in June 2022 and transferred to Belgium by the air force earlier this summer. He was subject of an Interpol Red Notice, with countries including Brazil demanding his extradition for drug trafficking, money laundering, forging documents and murder in connection with organized crime.\n\nThe Belgian prosecutor said in a July letter to the UK, that nearly all the evidence has been collected and that she aimed to conclude the probe in early September. She said she\u2019d already decided the case will go to a full criminal trial. A spokesperson confirmed the letter and declined to comment.\n\nIn London, Marchesani\u2019s lawyers said they planned a further challenge to his extradition because investigators were presenting different cases at different moments. If convicted, Marchesani faces a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment in Belgium, a country his lawyers say he\u2019s never visited.\n\n--With assistance from Stephanie Bodoni, Donal Griffin and Sarah Jacob.\n\n(Corrects to say that Marchesani isn\u2019t accused of converting cash into crypto in the sub heading and the second paragraph.)\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."

        "title": "Bitcoin price forecast: top in November 2025 - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Yesterday, a Bitcoin price prediction was published that reasons on the long term, i.e. on BTC cycles.\n\nIt was posted on X (formerly Twittter) by the crypto analyst who goes by the name CryptoCon.\n\nMaybe, I have finally cracked the #Bitcoin code.\n\n\n\nThe November 28th Cycles Theory has held the key.\n\n\n\nUsing 4-year time cycles against my Theory, produces Bitcoins exact behavior in time since its inception.\n\n\n\nCycles are centered around the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EI8BUk285I \u2014 CryptoCon (@CryptoCon_) September 7, 2023\n\nBitcoin\u2019s cycles\n\nBitcoin has a definite cycle that lasts on average about three years and ten months.\n\nThis is the cycle interrupted by the halving of miners\u2019 rewards, which is Bitcoin\u2019s only monetary policy measure, and it is quite predictable.\n\nIn fact, a halving always occurs exactly every 210,000 blocks, and it typically takes about 10 minutes to mine a block.\n\nIn theory, therefore, a halving should occur every 4 years or so, but so far the actual average block time has always been slightly less than 10 minutes.\n\nThis means that, on average, a halving has occurred every three years and ten months.\n\nThe first block of the Bitcoin blockchain was mined on 3 January 2009, and the first halving took place in November 2012.\n\nThere have been three halving events to date (2012, 2016 and 2020), and in all three cases the following year triggered a major bull run (2013, 2017 and 2021), followed by a bear market the following year (2014, 2018 and 2022).\n\nThe halving is thought to reduce the supply of BTCs on the market, as miners are forced to sell the BTCs they receive on the market to finance the high costs of mining (especially electricity).\n\nIf they collect less, they have less to sell and this reduces supply, although not immediately.\n\nThe next cycle\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next cycle will begin with the fourth halving, which will occur exactly at the 840,000 block that is expected to be mined in April 2024, or May at the latest.\n\nCryptoCon\u2019s forecast shows that the bottom of every bear market has marked a reversal in bitcoin\u2019s price trend, and this seems to have happened even after last November\u2019s bang.\n\nWe are now effectively in the fourth phase of the fourth cycle, although the first cycle is somewhat different from the others, so it is often not included in comparisons.\n\nThe next halving will start the first phase of the fifth cycle, which in all three previous cases has been characterised by a period of rising BTC prices.\n\nThis has always been followed by a second phase, the speculative bubble, which in turn is followed by the third phase, the bear market.\n\nCryptoCon\u2019s Bitcoin Price Forecast\n\nAccording to CryptoCon, the next bull run should start on the 28th of November 2024, with the next all-time high expected in a timeframe between the beginning of November and the end of December the following year.\n\nThe next bear market low should be recorded in a timeframe between the beginning of November and the end of December 2026.\n\nCryptoCon does not make any price predictions here, only about the course of the next price cycle.\n\nIn fact, although in theory there should be no certainty about Bitcoin\u2019s price trend, there is certainty about the halving cycle, i.e. the fact that BTC\u2019s monetary policy is updated every approximately three years and ten months.\n\nCryptoCon calls this prediction \u201cThe November 28th Cycles Theory\u201d, as the start of the bull run, the peak of the bubble and the trough of the bear market have historically occurred around this date. The 28th of November is also the date of the first halving, that of 2012.\n\nWe would then be in the pause phase of the fourth cycle, which should last until the next halving. This is historically the longest phase of the cycle, during which the price of bitcoin hovers around half of its all-time high ($69,000 in November 2021).\n\nHalving and price: The long-term forecast for Bitcoin\n\nAlthough it is clear from the chart published by CryptoCon that the price of bitcoin has so far slavishly followed the halving cycle, it is important to distinguish between the two.\n\nThe fact is that the halving is a safe and predictable technical process, whereas the price trend is not, as it also depends on external factors.\n\nWhat is surprising, however, is that in all these years, with very different macroeconomic conditions, the price cycle of bitcoin has continued to follow exactly the rhythm outlined by the 28 November theory, as if the halving cycle, fixed and certain, had managed to prevail over the uncertain and fickle external conditions.\n\nIt is possible that such an ironclad monetary policy does in fact produce relatively constant and predictable effects, with external conditions mainly conditioning its extremes and the magnitude of the rises and falls.\n\nOn the other hand, CryptoCon does not say in this forecast what prices bitcoin might reach in the future, but only when the various up and down phases will begin and when future peaks are likely to be recorded."
