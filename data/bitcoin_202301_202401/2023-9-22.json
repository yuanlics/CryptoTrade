        "title": "Bitcoin's first zero-knowledge light client seeks to drive innovation - Blockworks",
        "content": "A Swiss non-profit working on the world\u2019s first zero-knowledge light client for Bitcoin, has reached a major milestone towards bringing zero-knowledge proofs to the most valuable crypto network.\n\nZeroSync\u2019s verifier for the Bitcoin network\u2019s block headers makes it possible to build a zk proof-based light client for the network, the first step in a roadmap of permissionless innovation, according project lead Robin Linus.\n\nIn the near term, a light client might let you run a Bitcoin full node on, say, a mobile phone. But that roadmap includes a second-layer protocol on top of Bitcoin, that can bring tokens \u2014 such as stablecoins \u2014 to the Bitcoin network, along with a 20 to 50 times throughput increase, without requiring any sort of fork.\n\n\u201cWhat is cool about that solution is that, first of all, you can process about 100 transactions on the base layer,\u201d Linus told Blockworks. \u201cAnd in addition to that, we also get perfect privacy \u2014 you can encrypt both the transaction amounts and the transaction graphs, and then you basically get best-in-class privacy, comparable to Zcash.\u201d\n\nThe privacy benefit is essentially a byproduct of the protocol\u2019s use of STARKs, the proving system invented by StarkWare, not a deliberate design choice.\n\nZeroSync received a grant from Geometry Research in 2022, one from StarkWare earlier this year, and has since formed the foundation. The group\u2019s work is the first effort to use StarkWare\u2019s Cairo programming language outside of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nA soft fork would be required to enable trustless bitcoin bridging on the layer-2 network that ZeroSync envisions. Yet even without that, the network can permissionlessly support useful features, such as token transfers where the fees are paid in a stablecoins, removing the need for bitcoin (BTC) to pay for transactions.\n\nBitcoin is resistant to change by design, requiring consensus from Core developers, and near-consensus from full node operators, including miners. The prior soft fork in 2021, called Taproot, was years in the making and only activated after more than 90% of node operators signaled their assent.\n\n\u201cWe want it to be hard to change so that it can be hard money, but some changes are necessary,\u201d Linus said. \u201cIt seems to be that there is a consensus that at some point we do want to have some kind of [zk proof] verifier on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nLinus sees ZeroSync\u2019s role as helping figure out what kind of approach makes the most sense.\n\n\u201cWe try to participate in the community and push that forward,\u201d he noted. \u201cEverything has to be free and open-source, otherwise it will never get into the main layer.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the chain state proof they\u2019ve completed won\u2019t require any kind of fork.\n\nWaiting for Bitcoin Simplicity\n\nZk proof technology is still in its infancy. There are many different proof systems available with various different tradeoffs to consider. Those choices have ramifications for virtual machines built on top. Linus recognizes it would be quite hard to reach consensus on just one.\n\nEric Wall, a board member of the StarkNet Foundation, and a bitcoin thought-leader, articulated one of the challenges with Bitcoin\u2019s decision-making process in this area.\n\n\u201cHow is the Bitcoin community ever supposed to reach consensus on enshrining a specific zk-verifying opcode, when the zk community itself is not in any way in consensus on what type of zkVM would be ideal for Bitcoin for the next year, let alone the next 5 or next 100 years?\u201d\n\nFortunately, Linus sees a likely solution coming via the Simplicity programming language, first unveiled by Blockstream about five years ago.\n\nSimplicity, a smart contract language similar to Solidity on Ethereum, has been described as \u201cBitcoin\u2019s last soft fork.\u201d If it is activated, it will \u201cvastly increase the scripting capabilities of Bitcoin,\u201d Linus said.\n\n\u201cWe are already starting to experiment with it because Blockstream just activated it on the Liquid testnet\u2026that will be the first step for us to experiment with a [zk proof] verifier on Bitcoin\u2019s main layer.\u201d\n\nStarkWare\u2019s co-founder, Eli Ben-Sasson, unsurprisingly advocates for the Cairo+STARK stack.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nBut Linus said the adoption of Simplicity would allow zk proof teams to sidestep the need to rely exclusively on one proof system or another.\n\n\u201cYou can pretty freely choose what proof system you want to use\u2026it\u2019s a high level language for smart contracting and that allows you to do basically any kind of computation that you can do in regular programming languages,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd so there wouldn\u2019t be much drama anymore about the question of which [zk proof] verifier we want to activate \u2014 we would basically just implement what we think is best,\u201d he added.\n\nIf anyone else thinks they have a better proof system, they\u2019re free to implement it, without needing anyone\u2019s permission.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The Federal Reserve's hold on the bitcoin price may be back in play following the central bank's latest policy update. Bitcoin's price action was generally unchanged this week, even after the Fed meeting, where the central bank hit pause on rate hikes but indicated it could hold rates at higher levels for longer than previously thought. The cryptocurrency is currently at the lower end of the tight range it has been stuck at for months between $25,000 and $30,000. However, unlike the March and June rallies that followed oversold conditions, bitcoin has been trading sideways since its last major drop . \"This move in rates is impacting long duration, speculative assets and bitcoin definitely falls into that camp,\" Rob Ginsberg, an analyst at Wolfe Research, told CNBC. \"Oversold conditions are a great indicator that you should rebound \u2014 you get concerned when [prices] don't respond.\" BTC.CM= YTD mountain Bitcoin has struggled to rebound from its Aug. 17 drop \"[When] rates break out to new cycle highs \u2026 it wouldn't surprise me if we take out [the] $25,000 support level \u2026 and then something starts to break in the system,\" he added. \"That's when the Fed pivots and that's when you see a violent rotation back into risk.\" Last year's crypto winter was unlike others before it in that the Federal Reserve and its inflation fighting rate hiking campaign had perhaps the biggest influence over bitcoin's price action. Bitcoin is now up about 60% in 2023, but the long-anticipated developments in regulation and the bitcoin exchange-traded fund space that were expected to be positive catalysts haven't propelled prices higher. Apathetic investors are on pause as they await next moves from the Fed. If bitcoin breaks above $28,000, it could continue to as high as $32,000 in the short term, Ginsberg said. However, he said it's not very likely as the market's recent deterioration would have to be a head fake. If bitcoin takes out the $25,000 support level, it could fall further still to between $20,000 and $21,000, according to Ginsberg. \"Real rates are moving higher and they're breaking out to cycle highs,\" he said. \"That to me is still the biggest headwind for speculation and crypto in particular. So you need to see that breakeven and work lower to get people to come back into that part of the market.\""

        "title": "There Are Only Six Bitcoin Billionaires in the Whole World. Is Crypto Becoming Irrelevant? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A recent report from Henley Global into crypto wealth showed that there are only six Bitcoin (BTC) billionaires in the world. That's just six people who hold over a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin on the entire planet. When you think about the amount of hype around crypto, six Bitcoin billionaires really isn't a lot.\n\nThe report also says that the total value of the cryptocurrency market is $1.2 trillion. That's a drop in the ocean when you compare it with other assets. For example, the World Gold Council puts the market cap of the gold market at around $12 trillion. Last year, State Street Global Advisors said the total value of all investable assets was a whopping $179.0 trillion.\n\nSome might argue those figures show the huge potential of crypto -- right now, it accounts for less than 1% of the total investable assets. Just imagine what might happen if it could take even a slightly bigger chunk of that pie. But the opposite could also be true. Perhaps crypto just isn't that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin billionaire?\n\nThere are different ways you can define a Bitcoin billionaire. The report looks at people who own a billion dollars' worth of Bitcoin. But at one point in 2021, the same label was used for people who made their billions in crypto. The study, which also counts a total of 22 crypto billionaires globally, doesn't say how any of them came by their wealth.\n\nIt's certainly true that the net worth of several of the high profile crypto billionaires has significantly diminished since the crypto frenzy we saw a few years ago. In 2022, Forbes said there were 19 billionaires who'd made their money through crypto. That included Sam Bankman-Fried, who has since fallen from both rich lists and popular favor faster than an ice cream melts on a sunny day.\n\nIndeed, according to Forbes, this year, 10 of the 19 are no longer billionaires. And their collective wealth has fallen from $140 billion to $30 billion. That $110 billion drop is partly a reflection of the drop in crypto's value. It's also due to the collapse of several crypto platforms, including Bankman-Fried's empire. Bitcoin has mostly hovered between around $20,000 and $30,000 this year -- significantly down on its high of around $67,000 in November 2021.\n\nOur top crypto play isn't a token - Here\u2019s why We\u2019ve found one company that\u2019s positioned itself perfectly as a long-term picks-and-shovels solution for the broader crypto market \u2014 Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and all the others. In fact, you've probably used this company's technology in the past few days, even if you've never had an account or even heard of the company before. That's how prevalent it's become.

Learn more and get started today with a special new member discount. Get started\n\nIs crypto becoming irrelevant?\n\nIt is interesting to look at crypto billionaires. But, for the most part, they can handle losing money on a risky asset like cryptocurrency. It's the ordinary investors like you and me who may not be able to stomach the losses. Given that Henley & Partners report puts the number of crypto users at 425 million, that's a lot of people who could take a significant financial hit if crypto collapses.\n\nThe dramatic drop in crypto prices and collapse of several crypto platforms has been accompanied by a significant decline in both consumer interest and confidence. Many investors who had money on now-defunct platforms now await the outcome of what could be lengthy bankruptcy proceedings to see if they will get their money back.\n\nAs an investor, the current crisis of confidence is one thing. The bigger question is whether Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could perform well in the long term. And, given that cryptocurrencies are extremely risky, the related question is whether there are other, safer, assets that could perform as well or better over time.\n\nFor cryptocurrency to stay relevant and reach its potential, it needs to overcome a number of challenges. Putting aside the regulatory and confidence issues, there's still a long way to go with the actual nuts and bolts of crypto. For example, if it's to become more widely adopted, crypto needs to be as easy to use as email or online banking. It needs to become more widely accepted as a payment method. There are also issues of scalability, congestion, and network fees to address.\n\nThere are many different investment opportunities\n\nI hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and I plan to hold them for the long term. Bitcoin could have significant potential as a digital currency, particularly when it comes to global settlements. I also think smart contract cryptocurrencies could be transformative in a number of ways. However, there are no guarantees and it is still early days. Even if the cryptocurrency industry as a whole succeeds, the coins and tokens that are popular right now may not.\n\nUnless you're a billionaire with money to burn, the biggest takeaway is this: Don't count on crypto to make you wealthy. It can play a part in a wider portfolio, but only a small part. If you want to build up a nest egg for your old age, consider opening a brokerage account. Making consistent investments over time into a balanced portfolio that contains a mix of assets is a proven way to build wealth.

        "content": "Bitcoin dropped Friday morning in Asia to trade below the US$27,000 support level. Ether also retreated and lost control of the US$1,600 mark for the first time in the past week. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged losses in the past 24 hours. Solana led the losers with a slide of over 3%. The drop in crypto prices coincided with a decline Thursday in global equity markets as investors digested hawkish U.S. Fed remarks on monetary policy. U.S. stock futures were trading flat during opening hours in Asia after all three major U.S. indexes logged losses of over 1.0% Thursday.\n\nCryptos drop as US bond yields soar\n\nBitcoin fell 2.10% in the last 24 hours to US$26,580.90 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fell to US$26,389.30 on Thursday night, its lowest level in a week.\n\nAfter deciding to keep interest rates unchanged in September as expected, the U.S. Federal Reserve projected one more interest rate hike by the end of 2023. While it lowered its prediction for the pace of interest rate cuts in 2024, comments from Fed members were \u201cmore hawkish\u201d than analysts expected.\n\n\u201cThe drop in most tokens this morning could reflect the cautious stance of investors, who are carefully digesting the implications of the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent interest rate remarks,\u201d said John Stefanidis, CEO of blockchain infrastructure platform Balthazar DAO.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the surge in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to 16-year highs could have played a role in reshaping market dynamics,\u201d Stefanidis added.\n\nFollowing the Fed meeting Wednesday, benchmark 10-year U.S. treasury yields rose to a 16-year high of 4.49% on Thursday.\n\n\u201cU.S. equity and rates markets have broken some very key levels on the back of this (Fed projection), and reflexivity can take over with the bearish thesis from here,\u201d said digital asset trading firm QCP Capital in a Thursday Telegram market update.\n\nThe drop in equity markets and rising treasury yields \u201ccould seep into crypto markets and take BTC lower with it, albeit with a lower beta as compared to other very stretched macro markets like the NASDAQ,\u201d said QCP Capital.\n\nDespite macro pressures, Bitcoin can receive some support from the multiple spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications ongoing in the U.S., said Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport.\n\n\u201cIf the SEC approves a Bitcoin ETF, which we believe is a 70% probability over the next six months, then there could be an immediate re-pricing and Bitcoin could be +20% more expensive in an instant. Hence, it is essential to keep upside exposure to such an event,\u201d Thielen said in an emailed comment.\n\nEther fell 2.35% to US$1,585.53 and was trading 2.66% lower for the week. The world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency fell below the US$1,600 support level for the first time since last Thursday.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted losses in the past 24 hours. Solana\u2019s SOL led the losers, falling 3.73% to US$19.54. But it still posted a weekly gain of 3.35%\n\nMeanwhile, the collapsed Tokyo-based crypto exchange Mt. Gox delayed the deadline to repay its customers from October 2023 to October 2024, according to an announcement by Mt. Gox trustees on Thursday.\n\nAround 850,000 Bitcoins (worth about US$22.57 billion at the current price) were stolen from Mt. Gox in 2014, which was then the largest crypto exchange in the world. The crypto exchange currently holds about 142,000 Bitcoins. Analysts expect the return of the lost Bitcoin to Mt. Gox customers will exert selling pressure on the wider Bitcoin market.\n\n\u201c(Mt. Gox\u2019s delay) alleviates \u2014 at least for now \u2014 a wave of selling that many traders must have been prepping for and that can now be ignored,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\nElsewhere, Tether Holdings, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, expanded its USDT lending services during the latest financial quarter, less than one year after saying it would phase out the practice.\n\n\u201cMost investors and holders would see that as additional risk, as it means more assets will be used by third parties and, if market conditions were to turn for the worse, could pose liquidity issues,\u201d said d\u2019Anethan.\n\nUSDT traded at US$1.0001 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, slightly higher than its 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar. The valuation suggests \u201cinvestors are not worried and actually prefer it to most other stablecoin options,\u201d said d\u2019Anethan.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.67% in the past 24 hours to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume jumped 158.64% to US$72.41 billion.\n\nNo sign of US economic slowdown; BOJ maintains monetary easing\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading flat as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. Wall Street closed lower Thursday, the Nasdaq Composite leading the losers with a 1.82% slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 also booked losses of over 1%.\n\nMost major Asian stock indexes were down Thursday morning. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all booked losses. The Kospi led the losers with a 0.92% drop, while China\u2019s Shanghai Composite posted a marginal gain of 0.05%\n\nThe drop in equity markets followed the Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish tone on monetary policies at its September meeting Wednesday. Fed members projected the interest rate to reach 5.6% by the end of 2023, indicating another 25-basis-point rate hike to come within the year. The Fed also raised the projected median interest rate by the end of 2024 from 4.6% to 5.1% in a sign it intends to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nThe Fed may need to further raise the interest rate \u201cto make sure that core inflation especially continues to come down at an appropriate pace so the committee can get back to 2% inflation in a reasonable time frame,\u201d Former Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard told Bloomberg on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe prospects for a soft landing are very good, but you haven\u2019t landed until you get inflation back to 2%,\u201d said Bullard. The U.S. core consumer price index (CPI) for August rose 4.3% year-on-year, the smallest increase in almost two years.\n\nOn the economic data front, the initial jobless claims in the U.S. dropped to 201,000 in the week ending Sept. 16. The figure is lower than the analyst expectation of 225,000 and marks the lowest level since January. The data could add to the Fed hawkishness regarding monetary policy.\n\n\u201cThis economy is just not showing any sign of slowing down which hints that inflation will not be coming back down to target,\u201d Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York, told Reuters on Friday. \u201cThe Fed was wise to keep another interest rate hike in their back pockets just in case, and it now looks like another rate hike is warranted.\u201d\n\nThe Fed meets on Nov. 1 to make its next decision on interest rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 73.8% chance of no interest rate hike in November, up from 71.6% on Thursday. It also gives a 54.8% chance of another pause in December, up from 53.4% on Thursday.\n\nElsewhere, Russia issued a temporary ban on diesel and gasoline exports on Thursday with an unspecified end date. The announcement triggered a jump in diesel prices in Europe.\n\n\u201cDespite this being only a temporary ban, the impact is significant as Russia remains a key diesel exporter to global markets,\u201d Alan Gelder, vice president of refining, chemicals and oil markets at global consultancy group Wood Mackenzie Ltd., told Bloomberg on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe global refining system will struggle to replace those lost Russian volumes at a time when global diesel inventories are already at low levels,\u201d Gelder added.\n\nIn Japan, the country\u2019s central bank announced its own decision on interest rates Friday. The Bank of Japan will maintain its ultra loose monetary policy. That includes a short-term interest rate target of -0.1% and an effective cap of 1.0% on 10-year bond yields.\n\n(Updates with equity section, Stefanidis\u2019 comment)"

        "content": "Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies\n\nWith recent developments in the regulatory, legal, and compliance landscape surrounding Bitcoin and a spot Bitcoin ETF (i.e., an ETF backed by physical Bitcoins. If the value of the digital coins backing the ETF rises, the value of the investment will generally be expected to increase), some investment advisers may be considering how to potentially integrate Bitcoin (and/or other types of cryptocurrencies) into client portfolios. This Alert is intended to provide an update on the regulatory landscape and inform advisers how to fulfill their compliance and fiduciary obligations should they determine to integrate Bitcoin (specifically, the current GBTC (see below) and/or anticipated ETFs that will invest in Bitcoin or other types of cryptocurrencies) into client portfolios or assist a client with a requested purchase thereof. Please Note: This Alert is not, and does not serve as, an endorsement of Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency. Advisers must separately educate their investment professionals and clients about cryptocurrencies prior to integrating crypto into client portfolios or assisting with a client directed purchase.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin is considered to be speculative. The SEC has been aggressively reviewing cryptocurrency investments during examinations. Depending upon the scope of an adviser\u2019s assistance with/use of crypto (employing same as a courtesy/client directed accommodation vs. utilizing same as an asset class in client portfolios) both applicable clear and conspicuous ADV disclosure, and a separate Acknowledgment executed by the client, are strongly encouraged-we continue to assist our clients with such disclosures/acknowledgements.\n\nRegulatory Landscape\n\nOn August 29, 2023, the United States Court of Appeals of the D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of Grayscale Investments in Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit against the SEC for denying the company\u2019s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF. The Court\u2019s ruling vacated an order by the SEC denying Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application and requires the SEC to consider the application anew.\n\nThe ruling could have far-reaching implications for other spot Bitcoin ETF applications. As of August 30, 2023, the SEC is considering 14 spot Bitcoin ETF applications, including applications from financial behemoths like BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Invesco, to name a few. Analysts have predicted that odds of spot Bitcoin ETF approval are 75% in 2023 and 95% in 2024. With the imminent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, investment advisers could determine to consider adding a Bitcoin ETF to client portfolios. However, doing so comes with compliance implications, and it is critical for advisers to conduct appropriate due diligence to confirm that such integration is reasonable and suitable for clients.\n\nCompliance Program\n\nInvestment advisers registered at the federal and state level are required to maintain a robust compliance program. Advisers who want to integrate a Bitcoin (or other type of crypto) ETF should update their policies and procedures to address the unique risks and challenges that Bitcoin presents, including:\n\nSuitability \u2013 prior to proactively (vs. only per client request/direction) purchasing a Bitcoin ETF for clients, advisers should confirm that these assets are suitable for the client. Bitcoin is historically (and notoriously) volatile, and advisers should assess whether an investment in Bitcoin (or any other type of cryptocurrency) is consistent with a client\u2019s suitability, long-term objectives, and risk tolerance.\n\n\u2013 prior to proactively (vs. only per client request/direction) purchasing a Bitcoin ETF for clients, advisers should confirm that these assets are suitable for the client. Bitcoin is historically (and notoriously) volatile, and advisers should assess whether an investment in Bitcoin (or any other type of cryptocurrency) is consistent with a client\u2019s suitability, long-term objectives, and risk tolerance. Disclosures and Acknowledgements \u2013 advisers should request that clients execute an Acknowledgement which, among other disclosures, makes clear that cryptocurrencies are considered to be speculative investment, and that unlike conventional currencies issued by a monetary authority, currently, cryptocurrencies are generally not controlled or regulated, and their price is determined by the supply and demand of their market. Additionally, those advisers who are considering proactively incorporating crypto into client portfolios should amend their Brochure (i.e., Form ADV Part 2A) to include language that similarly describes the risks associated with Bitcoin and how the adviser can integrate crypto into a client\u2019s portfolio (i.e., on a discretionary/non-discretionary basis, or at specific client direction). Stark & Stark can assist with preparing the acknowledgement and appropriate ADV disclosure language.\n\nFiduciary Duty\n\nRegistered investment advisers are fiduciaries and are required to act in the best interests of their clients. As such, comes the responsibility to:\n\nConduct thorough due diligence, including understanding bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics, its correlation with other assets, and the technology behind it;\n\nEducate clients so that they can better understand both the risks and potential rewards of investing in Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrencies); and,\n\nDisclose the fees associated with such an investment (i.e., both the underlying investment\u2019s fees and the adviser\u2019s fee).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s ruling on Grayscale\u2019s spot ETF application, and the SEC\u2019s currently anticipated approval of a spot ETF, reflects Bitcoin\u2019s growing legitimacy as an asset (however, as indicated above, this Alert is not, and should not be construed in any manner whatsoever as, an endorsement of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency investment). However, integrating Bitcoin into client portfolios comes with compliance obligations. By adhering to a robust compliance framework, keeping abreast of regulatory changes, and educating themselves and clients on the both the risks and benefits of Bitcoin, advisers can seek to harness the potential of Bitcoin while fulfilling their fiduciary and compliance obligations."

        "title": "Bitcoin blasts past its 2021 all-time high in Argentina, but hyperinflation outpaces gains - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Argentina has grappled with hyperinflation for several decades due to failed policies that have led to budget deficits. As time marches on, the likelihood of Argentina \u2014 home to 47 million people \u2014 facing a full-scale currency collapse looms. But what are the prospects for increased adoption of Bitcoin (BTC), given its outstanding track record when priced in the local Argentine peso currency?\n\nThroughout its history, the Argentine government has frequently resorted to inflating the money supply through bank deposits or government bonds. Notably, Argentina\u2019s aggregate money supply M1 \u2014 comprising currency, demand deposits and other checkable deposits \u2014 has surged from 2.81 trillion pesos in July 2019 to a staggering 10.66 trillion pesos, marking a 277% increase over three years.\n\nWhat happened to Bitcoin\u2019s price in Argentine pesos?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price on domestic exchanges has soared to 19.6 million Argentine pesos, up from 14.2 million when BTC reached its all-time high in United States dollars in November 2021. This means that despite a 61.5% drop from $69,000, investors in Argentina have still managed to accrue gains of 38% when measured in the local currency.\n\nBitcoin price in pesos at Bitso exchange. Source: Bitso\n\nHowever, one may encounter a different result when consulting Google or CoinMarketCap for Bitcoin\u2019s price in pesos. The answer to this discrepancy lies in the official currency rate for the Argentine peso, which is more intricate than most investors are accustomed to.\n\nTo begin with, there is the official rate, known as the \u201cdollar BNA,\u201c set by Argentina\u2019s central bank and used for all government transactions, as well as for imports and exports.\n\nBitcoin price in pesos on Sept. 21. Sources: Google, Ripio, Bitso.\n\nObserve how the Bitcoin price in Argentine pesos, as effectively traded on cryptocurrency exchanges, is nearly double Google\u2019s theoretical price.\n\nThis theoretical price is calculated by multiplying the BTC price on North American exchanges in U.S. dollars by the official Argentine peso rate provided by the local government. This phenomenon is not unique to cryptocurrencies; it also affects other highly liquid international assets, such as stocks, gold and oil futures.\n\nBy artificially strengthening the official rate in favor of the Argentine peso, the government aims to stabilize the economy, reduce capital flight, and curb speculative trading by making it more expensive to purchase foreign currency and store wealth in U.S. dollars. This measure may also increase the cost of imports while boosting exports, with the goal of improving the trade balance.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin soars in Argentina as Javier Milei wins presidential primary\n\nHowever, manipulating the official foreign exchange rate, as seen in Argentina\u2019s case, ultimately contributes to inflation and impedes economic growth. Firstly, it creates incentives for the existence of an unofficial and unregistered market, known as the \u201cdollar blue,\u201d which also fosters illegal activities, undermines financial transparency and discourages foreign investment.\n\nThis leads to varying exchange rates, depending on the market in which the transaction occurs and whether or not it involves the government and official banks.\n\nIs Bitcoin a reliable store of value for investors in Argentina?\n\nAccording to Bitso exchange prices in Argentine pesos, Bitcoin has gained 150% over the two years ending Sept. 21, moving from 7.84 million pesos to 16.6 million pesos. However, the accumulated official inflation rate during this period has exceeded 300%, making it incorrect to claim that Bitcoin has been a dependable store of value.\n\nNotably, those who opted for U.S. dollars, whether in the traditional form or stablecoins, have seen their holdings increase by 297% during the same period, effectively matching the inflation rate. This analysis exclusively compares the two-year period between September 2021 and September 2023.\n\nNonetheless, the outcome is somewhat disappointing for BTC proponents and is likely to favor the adoption of stablecoins in the region.\n\nOn a positive note, investors have had the opportunity to learn about the advantages of self-custody and scarcity, given that the local currency has been decimated by its continuously inflating supply.\n\nIn the end, for Argentinians, as long as the U.S. dollar maintains its purchasing power by keeping pace with local inflation, there is little room for Bitcoin to become the preferred store of value.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin Miners' Digital Power Network Shows Off Industry Consolidation - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Political advocacy group Digital Power Network launches, representing 50% of total US hash rate. A look at consolidation in the mining industry before next halving.\n\nBy Landon Manning\n\nThe Chamber of Digital Commerce, a political advocacy group dedicated to Bitcoin and the crypto sphere, has turned heads with an announcement that the members of its new mining-specific group represent more than 50 percent of the entire US Bitcoin mining industry.\n\nThe Chamber of Digital Commerce has existed since 2014, with its own registered committee able to make contributions to political candidates. Although its existence represented a significant step for the growing relationship between a hostile political establishment and the new economic world of cryptocurrency, its footprint remained relatively small for most of its existence. Campaign disclosures have only recorded $2700 in donations for any Congressional races, in 2017, but in March 2023 they partnered with a Texas Representative to introduce a bill supporting proof-of-work mining.\n\nThe Chamber\u2019s work in getting this bill off the ground has apparently been quite useful in building up industry connections, because it made a major splash in late September by announcing the formation of a new working group: the Digital Power Network. With a mission statement of promoting the interests of American miners, the Network plans to partner with legislators to support fair and straightforward regulation over many aspects of the crypto industry. This is all well and good, but this new group has some real heft to back up these goals: its various members collectively represent more than half of the nation\u2019s entire Bitcoin hash rate.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why a group like this is so necessary, according to Perianne Boring, founder and CEO of the Chamber for Digital Commerce. She said in interviews that \u201cdigital asset mining, at its heart, is both an energy and national security matter, and we firmly believe that Bitcoin will drive policies that unite all political stakeholders to advance this crucial industry in the United States.\u201d The various representatives in the Digital Power Network seem to share her enthusiasm, with Riot Blockchain CEO Jason Les claiming that \u201cat its core, Bitcoin mining converts stranded, low-cost energy into a valuable commodity, which is why our industry has tremendous potential\u201d and Marathon CEO Fred Thiel declaring the group \u201cimportant for ensuring that the perspectives of digital energy stakeholders are considered.\u201d These two firms alone are some of the most productive Bitcoin miners in the United States.\n\nA development like this in the crypto mining world is vitally important not only for the possibilities of the group, but also for the state of the industry that such a group can even exist. Among these companies, one topic has been growing and growing in everyone\u2019s mind: the upcoming Bitcoin halving. A planned occurrence within the Bitcoin blockchain, halvings occur every few years to ensure a stable taper in the supply of available bitcoins, and the next one is coming soon. After some time around April 2024, the same exact amount of work from mining rigs will produce half as much Bitcoin, and it will be up to the miners to figure out how to keep their businesses profitable.\n\nSeveral strategies are immediately apparent for these companies: for one, most obviously, efficient equipment is key. Especially with growing concerns of the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, the halving will make it simply unviable to actually use outdated equipment at large scale. Similarly, firms have been encouraged to diversify investments, build up cash reserves and several other tactics that point to one overall strategy: consolidation of capital. Smaller firms that are unable to remain functional after the halving, to buy new equipment or stay in business without cash flow, will simply be pushed out, and the survivors will have a larger share of the new pie to split amongst themselves.\n\nThis consolidation is already evident from the emergence of the Digital Power Network. Their site lists 11 major players as members of this miner advocacy group, and their consortium represents most of the US Bitcoin mining industry. It is certain that every one of these firms has given a great deal of thought to the upcoming halving, and in all likelihood this group is part of their long-term plans. And even outside of these major players, signs of this increasing consolidation are ubiquitous. For example, Hut 8, a Canadian bitcoin mining company, has received approval from the Supreme Court of British Columbia on September 18th, authorizing them to carry out a merger with US Bitcoin Corp. This new company will be chartered within the United States, and upon incorporation the new \u201cHut 8 Corp\u201d will immediately become one of the largest mining companies in the nation. Hut 8\u2019s stock price went up by 6.5% after gaining this approval, showing off the market\u2019s confidence.\n\nBetween these firms that represent such a large chunk of the Bitcoin mining industry, and new mining giants forming by merger outside of the Digital Power Network, it seems clear that the consolidation of industry is a serious tactic for these companies to survive in a wildly competitive mining ecosystem. With all these giants, after all, how many smaller companies exist to make up the remaining share of the pie? And more to the point, how many of those companies will continue to exist a year from now? The world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is wide in scale and chaotic in temperament; it requires a deft hand to stay afloat. Yet, with moves like these, it seems clear that the miners have full confidence in their abilities to thrive, and this attitude is representative of the whole crypto scene. With an innovative and industrious mindset, Bitcoin has fostered a community of movers and shakers that can propel decentralized currency into the future.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "On this week\u2019s episode of Macro Markets, Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman discusses the real estate markets, highlighting stagnant mortgage demand, attributed to rising rates. With an average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage interest rate of 7.27%, refinancing and home purchase applications have dropped significantly.\n\nStill, Pechman speculates that house prices might rise if inflation continues to grow. While some sellers may be distressed, real estate, especially urban residential, has historically been a reliable store of value. He concludes by highlighting that other investment options may not provide a safer haven in the current economic climate.\n\nIn the second segment, Pechman discusses Instacart\u2019s initial public offering, which established its valuation at roughly $10 billion, significantly lower than its $39 billion peak valuation. This reflects the challenges faced by venture capitalists in the current economic climate. Pechman suggests a shift in investor metrics, emphasizing the need for a reliable store of value, where cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) could play a role.\n\nPechman notes that not all cryptocurrencies seek growth through user bases and fees. Bitcoin can operate as a transparent reserve system for banks and nations, issuing Bitcoin-backed digital assets without requiring a billion users. This shift in perspective highlights the need for a reliable store of value. Unlike precious metals with auditing challenges, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies can fill this role regardless of everyday user adoption.\n\nFor additional details and the complete analysis, check out the Cointelegraph YouTube channel."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency is a young asset class. Over its brief life span, it\u2019s developed a reputation for sharp price action in both directions. Bitcoin is a case study in that trait.\n\nDramatic, short-term declines by bitcoin have a way of unnerving smaller investors. This is especially so when it puts newly initiated positions at immediate deficits. That underscores the utility of equity-based crypto plays, including the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) and the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users and Decentralized Commerce ETF (BLKC) .\n\nThose Invesco exchange traded funds could be relevant to smaller investors seeking crypto/bitcoin exposure. This is the case because bitcoin\u2019s recent price action has been weak. Since popping above $30,000 on speculation, regulators could finally approve a U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF, the largest digital currency has stumbled, recently sliding below $27,000.\n\nBLKC, SATO Could Help New Bitcoin Investors\n\nBLKC, SATO and other equity-based crypto ETFs are not foolproof avenues for accessing digital currencies. In particular, SATO holdings are often highly correlated to bitcoin prices. Still, the ETFs could be safer avenues for short-term holders (STH) seeking crypto exposure.\n\n\u201cSTHs, which correspond to entities holding coins for 155 days or less, have seen their aggregate cost basis fail as market support,\u201d reported William Suberg for Cointelegraph. \u201cAs Glassnode notes, as of Sep. 17, the cost basis for those not spending BTC is now $28,000 \u2014 around 5% above current spot price.\u201d\n\nMany bitcoin newbies aren\u2019t buying significant stakes in the cryptocurrency right off the bat. Their behavior is relevant because data indicates smaller bitcoin investors who see quick profits are apt to add to their positions, while counterparts on the other end of the spectrum become skittish about buying more.\n\n\u201cFrom this perspective, we can see that the cost basis of STHs who are spending fell below the cost basis of holders as the market sold off from $29k to $26k in mid-August,\u201d according to Glassnode.\n\nAdditionally, smaller crypto market participants are pertinent in terms of gauging market sentiment. On that note, bitcoin market sentiment is currently dour because so many new entrants are in the red on their positions.\n\n\u201cThis has resulted in a negative shift in sentiment, with investors spending now having a lower cost basis than the rest of the cohort. This suggests a degree of panic is dominating this group, which is the first time since FTX collapsed,\u201d added Glassnode."

        "title": "Nic Carter doubles down on theory Bitcoin was invented by NSA - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin advocate Nic Carter has come out to reiterate his support for the theory that the United States National Security Agency (NSA) had something to do with the creation of Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nOn Sept. 15, Iris Energy co-founder Daniel Roberts seemingly revived the decade-old theory on X after posting screenshots of a 1996 paper titled \u201cHow to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash.\"\n\nThe paper discusses using public-key cryptography to allow users to make anonymous payments without revealing their identity \u2014 referencing a number of academic cryptographers.\n\nThe footer notes show the research paper was \u201cprepared by NSA employees.\u201d Sources included cryptography expert Tatsuaki Okamoto, who later co-invented the Okamoto\u2013Uchiyama public key cryptosystem in 1998.\n\nOn Sept. 21, Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, doubled down his support for the notion, stating, \u201cI actually do believe this,\u201d before adding:\n\n\u201cI call it the \u2018Bitcoin lab leak hypothesis.\u2019 I think it was a shuttered internal R&D project, which one researcher thought was too good to lay fallow on the shelf and chose to secretly release.\u201d\n\nCarter has actually held the theory for several years, proposing back in 2020: \u201cIf Bitcoin was written by NSA cryptographers as a monetary bioweapon, if you will, and the code escaped those sensitive confines... does that make it a virus... that escaped from a lab?\u201d\n\nIn 2021, he stated, \u201cThe only decent thing the NSA ever did from the world was let bitcoin leak from the lab.\u201d\n\nI actually do believe this. I call it the bitcoin lab leak hypothesis. I think it was a shuttered internal R&D project which one researcher thought was too good to lay fallow on the shelf and chose to secretly release https://t.co/qXJkQTciSK \u2014 nic carter (@nic__carter) September 21, 2023\n\nHowever, he went on to say that this doesn\u2019t imply that the United States government secretly controls all the Bitcoin, another theory that often piggybacks on the Bitcoin/NSA conspiracy theory, which suggests the NSA created a backdoor to the Bitcoin code.\n\n\u201cIn my version of this made-up idea, the researcher did it without permission of the NSA and chose to leave the coins behind so as to preserve his anonymity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of other circumstantial evidence which supports this [theory],\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, some users drew attention to one of the cryptography academics, Tatsuaki Okamoto, listed in the 1996 paper, suggesting the name sounds very similar to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe name could have been used as inspiration for Satoshi. That\u2019s not really a critical part of the theory, though,\u201d Carter said.\n\nRelated: This is how Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned crypto working\n\nMeanwhile, Matthew Pines, director of intelligence at cybersecurity firm Krebs Stamos, believes it was most likely a \u201ccross-fertilization of NSA crypto nerds and cypherpunk nerds,\u201d adding:\n\n\u201cI suspect Satoshi (or at least his/their close intellectual collaborators) has close NSA work associations \u2014 but I don\u2019t think Bitcoin itself or the white paper were officially sanctioned.\u201d\n\nFormer Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal has previously shared his own theory. In an interview with Impact Theory earlier this year, he said:\n\n\u201cI think the U.S. government and the U.K. government invented it... which is the NSA and the GCHQ in the U.K., who are the two world centers of cryptography.\u201d\n\nIn August, Cointelegraph did a deep dive into the conspiracy theory and interviewed former NSA cryptanalyst Jeff Man, who said that, while it was \u201cfeasible\u201d that the NSA could have created Bitcoin as a means to gather intelligence about its enemies, it is highly doubtful.\n\nHowever, Man concluded that even if they did, it is likely we\u2019ll never find out the real story behind the world\u2019s most popular digital asset until it doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin?\n\nUpdate (Sept. 26, 12:48 am UTC): This article has been updated to reflect that the 1996 paper titled \u201cHow to Make a Mint\" was not the first paper to describe a Bitcoin-like system."

        "title": "Bitcoin miners double down on efficiency and renewable energy at the World Digital Mining Summit - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitmain rolled out its next-generation Antminer S21 and S21 Hydro ASIC miners at the World Digital Mining Summit (WDMS) in Hong Kong on Sept. 22, revealing the crucial performance stats the entire industry has been waiting for. The S21 has a hash rate of 200 terahashes per second (TH/s) and an efficiency of 17.5 joules per terahash (J/T), while the S21 hydro hashes at 335 TH/s and 16 J/T, which is notable given that until recently, most Bitcoin ASICS were operating above the 20 J/T level.\n\nWith electricity costs continuing to rise year-over-year and the Bitcoin halving projected to occur in April 2024, ASIC efficiency is quickly becoming the paramount focus of miners, and many are also pivoting toward folding in renewable energy sources as a core component of their operations.\n\nBitcoin miners focus on efficiency and renewable energy\n\nSustainable development in the mining industry was a core theme discussed in a majority of the panels at the WDMS. In the opening roundtable, team members from Terrawulf, Core Scientific, CleanSpark and Iris Energy shared their perspectives on how further integration of renewable energy sources will become a critical strategy to implement for many miners after the April 2024 Bitcoin supply halving.\n\nBitmain World Digital Mining Summit. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nAccording to Nazar Khan, Terrawulf\u2019s chief operating officer:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a significant transition going on in the supply side of the generation process; there\u2019s a concerted effort to decarbonize the entire supply stack, and so when we talk about Bitcoin miners consuming more renewable energy, that\u2019s part of a broader theme that\u2019s happening across the United States without Bitcoin mining as well. The role that we play is locating our Bitcoin mining loads in places where that\u2019s happening and how do we facilitate that decarbonization process.\u201c\n\nOne impact of the upcoming supply halving is that miners will maintain the same capital and operational costs, plus the need to pay down any revolving debts, while essentially seeing their block reward distribution cut in half.\n\nFor this reason, miners will either need to increase the percentage of their hash rate derived from sustainable energy sources or make efficiency adjustments to their ASIC fleet to maintain or increase their profitability.\n\nRegarding the rollout of the Antminer S21 and its potential impact on the mining industry, BMC founder Justin Kramer said:\n\n\u201cThe S21, if reliable, fairly priced and readily available \u2014 and yes, that\u2019s a lot of ifs with Bitmain\u2019s history \u2014 could revolutionize the crypto mining landscape with its efficiency. It is basically packing the power of two S19 100T miners into one unit. Despite this, the burgeoning aftermarket firmware market, coupled with hydro/immersion systems, give miners more tools to keep older generation miners, such as the S19, profitable also. Thus, while the S21 represents a notable advancement, it may not render sub 110 TH/s miners entirely obsolete.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about what else caught this eye from the S21 release, Kramer noted that:\n\n\u201cI like that Bitmain is rewarding environmentally friendly mining farms with better pricing and advanced delivery with their new Carbon Neutral Certificate. But, I\u2019ll add that, it was a little surprising when I noticed that both new S21 models offer 33% more hash rate (S21 200T versus 151T on S19j XP; S21 hydro is 335T versus the S19 XP Hydro at 257T). Is this a coincidence? I\u2019m doubtful, and it likely signals more of the same systematic model releases from Bitmain where a slight tweak to the firmware and maybe a few other items that are adjusted results in a moderate increase in hash rate and a brand-new miner.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is en route to becoming an ESG asset\n\nA theme of the past few years has been an increase in Bitcoin miners and BTC advocates pushing back against the assertion that Bitcoin mining is bad for the environment, and that the industry\u2019s reliance on carbon-based energy production accelerates emissions.\n\nCountering this perspective, Hong Kong Sustaintech Foundation professor in accounting and finance, Haitian Lu, bluntly announced that:\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is promoting renewable energy adoption in many areas.\u201d\n\nLu explained that \u201cover the years, Bitcoin mining has become more efficient and is also using cleaner energy. History tells us that human development from an agricultural society to industrialization to the future of a digitalized economy goes with every increasing energy consumption per capita. What makes the difference is human\u2019s ability to use renewable energy increases, thus achieving sustainable development.\u201d\n\nLike the perspectives shared by other panelists, Lu said that Bitcoin miners\u2019 participation in demand response agreements with power producers and distributors leads to energy grid efficiency, and they \u201cprovide an economic incentive for the development of renewable energy \u201cpromotion and development of renewable energy projects.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin mining tapping into stranded energy, encouraging the development of renewable energy projects and helping to balance electric grids, the efficiency advancements of next-generation ASICs like the Antminer S21 reduce miners\u2019 energy consumption while also allowing them to boost their profits."

Apart from the mining hardware purchase deal, Bitmain and Core Scientific have signed a new hosting arrangement to assist Bitmain\u2019s mining operations.\n\nThe deal was finalized in August when a court filing highlighted Bitmain\u2019s plan to sell mining hardware in exchange for cash and equity as part of Core Scientific\u2019s restructuring plan.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nU.S. Senator and Bitcoin skeptic Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) has been charged with bribery after allegedly accepting swaths of gold, cash, and mortgage payments as part of a \u201ccorrupt relationship\u201d with three businessmen in his home state.\n\nThe charges follow years of criticism from the politician targeting cryptocurrencies, which he has accused of enabling a range of criminal activities while empowering foreign actors to evade U.S. sanctions.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom at least 2018 up to and including in or about 2022, Menendez and his wife, Nadine Menendez, agreed to and did accept hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribes in exchange for using Menendez's power and influence,\u201d read the Friday indictment.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege Menendez helped enrich three businessmen\u2014Wael Hana, Jose Uribe and Fred Daibes\u2014while also benefiting the government of Egypt by providing \u201csensitive U.S. government information,\u201d among other charges.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor example, prosecutors say Menendez used his influence to dismantle a criminal probe in New Jersey against Uribe, and to protect an Egyptian business monopoly granted to Hana by the Egyptian government that was partly responsible for paying Menendez\u2019s bribes.\n\nMenendez denied the allegations in a statement. \u201cI remain focused on continuing this important work and will not be distracted by baseless allegations,\u201d he said. All in all, the senator faces three federal charges: conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, and conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right. If convicted, Menendez faces up to 20 years in prison.\n\n\n\nAccording to the indictment, in June 2022, a search warrant against Menendez, his home, and a safe deposit box revealed some of the proceeds from the alleged bribes: over $500,000 in cash, a luxury vehicle, and over $100,000 in gold bars. Prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of the seized assets.\n\nMenendez\u2019s use of more traditional instruments to allegedly hide ill-gotten gains presents a stark contrast to his historic outlook on Bitcoin. In 2017, the senator sent a letter to FinCEN stating that the \u201canonymous nature of Bitcoin transactions\u201d makes it \u201can ideal choice for criminals.\u201d\n\n\n\nMenendez is well known in crypto circles for co-sponsoring the Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador (ACES) Act, which seeks to investigate how El Salvador\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender could create \u201crisks for cybersecurity, economic stability, and democratic governance in El Salvador.\u201d\n\nMenendez was also among many politicians to sound the alarm on Facebook\u2019s now-defunct stablecoin project, Libra, in July 2019. \u201cLibra could be the Wild West of cryptocurrency where money launderers, criminals, and countries seeking to avoid U.S. sanctions could operate,\u201d he said during a Senate hearing at the time."

So, I think it\u2019s very clear that you need to be aware that they\u2019re not in desperate need for a given crypto to increase significantly in value.\u201d\n\nNot everyone would be inclined to agree with Christensen, however.\n\nBen Simpson, founder of crypto education platform Collective Shift, said there\u2019s a wealth of data and indicators that suggest that we\u2019re already witnessing the initial stages of a Bitcoin bull market.\n\n\u201cThe drawdown from the all-time high chart and market-value-to-realized-value ratio suggest we\u2019re in the final stages of accumulation, often a precursor to a bull market,\u201d explained Simpson.\n\nWhen it comes to the assets most primed for a major boom, Simpson believes the next bull market will blow wind into the sails of Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and application-specific tokens and sectors such as gaming.\n\n\u201cDeFi tokens are risky but offer significant upside, and Bitcoin, I believe, emerges as the \u2019silent winner\u2019 amid broader adoption and one I\u2019m most bullish on.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Bitcoin ETF won\u2019t have any impact on the price\u201d pic.twitter.com/ArSTwskEec \u2014 Ben Simpson (@bensimpsonau) September 13, 2023\n\nThe last two-year period has been tough for the crypto industry.

As rates begin to fall and inflation subsides, investors will take on more risk, deploying more capital into financial markets \u2014 and crypto will be front and center,\u201d he said.\n\nLike many market commentators in recent months, Gilbert asserted that next year looks primed for a rally.\n\n\u201c2024 could be a strong year for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. The Bitcoin halving is the centerpiece of this theory, and it\u2019s the major catalyst optimistic investors are focused on.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tina Teng, a market analyst from CMC Markets, explained that it\u2019s far too early to start worrying about whether or not massive gains are on the horizon. Instead, investors should be bracing themselves for a new wave of uncertainty.\n\nRelated: China suffers worst capital flight in years, but could it pump Bitcoin?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say that it\u2019s the start of a bull market in crypto.

In history, the cryptocurrency market\u2019s boom happened during the Fed\u2019s rate cut cycle but not a hiking cycle.\u201d\n\nShe continued:\n\n\u201cThe rampant government bond yields and inverted bond yields repeatedly flash warning signals for economic uncertainty ahead.\u201d\n\n#Bitcoin is racing down to realized loss on the 50-day moving average of the RPV ratio.\n\n\n\nAnd if previous cycles tell us anything, this is the last time it happens until the next cycle top!\n\n\n\nEach cycle, Bitcoin makes a\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Rrw7wYKbvA \u2014 CryptoCon (@CryptoCon_) September 1, 2023\n\nTeng said that for an imminent bull market thesis to be validated, Bitcoin needs to break through the 50-day moving average and catch a ride on another surge upward.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market \u2014 Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "title": "How An \u2018Inconsequential\u2019 Mistake Saw Bitcoin Crash To $8,000 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin is known to be a very volatile digital asset as its price is often wont to rise and fall unexpectedly, and sometimes without a clear reason. One of these instances of the digital asset flash-crashing was back in 2021 when the price of Bitcoin had fallen 87% on some exchanges in a matter of minutes. However, the mystery behind this flash crash has been unveiled two years after it first occurred.\n\nFormer Alameda Research Engineer Spills Secret\n\nAlameda Research is the sister company of the now-defunct FTX crypto exchange run by Caroline Ellison who served as CEO until it collapsed. Following the bankruptcy, employees at the trading firm have, at various times, come forward to tell stories of what took place at the company. This time around, an ex-engineer Aditya Baradwaj is telling the story of how a simple mistake caused the company to lose tens of millions of dollars.\n\nBaradwaj took to his X (formerly Twitter) account to reveal how an Alameda employee had unwittingly triggered a Bitcoin flash crash in 2021. According to him, the error was a result of two trading systems operated at the company.\n\nPART 2: THE FAT-FINGER or The story of how a misplaced decimal point at Alameda Research caused a market crash that echoed around the world. (1/n) \ud83e\uddf5#SBF #FTX pic.twitter.com/jCykh6rg1o \u2014 Adi (e/acc) (@aditya_baradwaj) September 20, 2023\n\nThe ex-engineer explained that Alameda had semi-systemic strategies in which a complex automated trading system was controlled by model parameters set by traders. The second was manual trading which would be done when the former could not execute a trade due to a number of reasons.\n\nIn the case of the trader who triggered the flash crash, they had to manually enter a trade to sell a large tranche of BTC using Alameda\u2019s manual trading system. However, the trader had failed to realize that the decimal point in the trade was off by a couple of spaces, which meant that they were selling the BTC at much lower prices than the current price.\n\nThe result of this simple error was Alameda selling off a sizable portion of BTC at pennies on the dollar which resulted in a flash crash on multiple exchanges. The crash was most prominent on the FTX and Binance exchanges, where prices fell from $65,000 to $8,000 in a matter of minutes.\n\nCovering Up The Bitcoin Crash\n\nThe aftermath of the flash crash, according to the ex-engineer, involved Alameda rushing to put in place sanity checks that should have been available before any manual trades were executed. He notes that this was not out of the ordinary as they were always waiting for things to break before fixing them at the company.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s usually how things worked at Alameda \u2013 we would wait until something broke, and then rush to fix it,\u201d he said. Baradwaj also referred to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried saying that the utility gained after the events outweighed the costs incurred from poor risk checks and hacks.\n\nHe also pointed to Binance commenting on the flash crash with a statement that blamed a bug in the trading algorithm of one of their institutional traders. \u201cI guess Caroline had made some phone calls,\u201d Baradwaj said, referring to Alameda\u2019s CEO.\n\nBTC price holding support | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Nairametrics, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) could see \u201csubstantial inflows\u201d from China within the next few months amid a weakening Chinese yuan and one of the country\u2019s biggest capital flights in years.\n\n\u201cThe familiarity of Bitcoin by Chinese investors in times of a weakening domestic economy could see substantial inflows into Bitcoin over the next few months,\u201d said Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport.\n\nThe latest official data, compiled by Bloomberg, shows China\u2019s capital outflows hit $49 billion in August, the largest monthly capital outflow since December 2015, potentially spelling more pressure for the yuan.\n\nChina just experienced a capital outflow of $49 billion last month, the largest outflow in more than 7 years pic.twitter.com/X4Or9k3Oiu \u2014 Barchart (@Barchart) September 19, 2023\n\n\u201cThe USD/CNY exchange rate is trading at a 17-year high as the U.S. economy is strongly expanding while the Chinese economy appears to have weak growth momentum,\u201d said Thielen.\n\n\u201cThe post-COVID-19 consumption rebound underwhelmed, and the authorities have not implemented enough countercyclical measures to support the economy. Chinese companies are suffering from weak margins in the absence of growth.\u201d\n\nThielen believes continued pressure on the yuan and the \u201cabsence of growth\u201d among local companies could see investors searching for opportunities outside of China.\n\nHowever, considering the country\u2019s strict capital controls, crypto may turn out to be one of the few channels available, he said, arguing:\n\n\u201cCrypto might be one of the only viable options.\u201d\n\nIn a Sept. 20 post on X, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes alluded to a similar possibility, suggesting that Chinese capital may already be flowing into gold and paying down United States dollar offshore debt. He also shared hopes that some of the capital would \u201cfind its way\u201d to Bitcoin.\n\nAs long as the $JPY weakens, the $CNY must weaken so that Chinese exports remain competitive vs. Japan.\n\n\n\nWherever the Chinese capital is going, it will keep going in SIZE.\n\n\n\nI hope some finds its way to Lord Satoshi and $BTC \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) September 20, 2023\n\nIn fact, such a narrative seemingly played out for Bitcoin in late 2016, with reports that investors in China were increasingly looking to Bitcoin to get capital out of the country.\n\nAt the time, the trading volume out of China suggested a possible link between the value of the Chinese yuan and the price of Bitcoin, which eventually peaked around late 2017.\n\nRelated: Sky-high interest rates are exactly what the crypto market needs\n\nHowever, Singular Research crypto analyst Edward Engel argues that times have changed and a Chinese capital flight today may not have the same impact on Bitcoin as it did then.\n\n\u201cThis is not something I\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Engel in a statement to Cointelegraph. \u201cThe last time I heard of something like this was 2017\u20132018, when junkets were using Bitcoin to support underground banks, but we all know the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] plugged those holes a while ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s gotten pretty savvy when it comes to stopping outflows, so I\u2019d be surprised if people were using older ways.\u201d\n\nJunkets refer to organizations that helped wealthy Chinese gamblers move substantial sums of money overseas. China has since cracked down heavily on these firms.\n\nThielen, however, claims there may still be surviving methods for Chinese capital to use crypto, such as using domestic electricity to mine crypto or using over-the-counter traders to buy Tether (USDT) via Tron to send crypto internationally \u2014 seemingly in the face of restrictions.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has continued to hover between $25,000 and $27,000 since mid-August. It is currently trading at $26,621, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro.\n\nMagazine: Asia Express: PEX staff flee event as scandal hits, Mt. Gox woes, Diners Club crypto"

        "content": "Bitcoin price rests below the $27,500 level as those who profited in the September 12-18 rise recently await the next move.\n\nEthereum price is likely to fall 5% if BTC shows weakness, sending ETH for a liquidity grab below the $1,552 support level.\n\nRipple price must break and close above the mean threshold at $0.5337 or fall 10% retracing the $0.4600 level.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price holds steady with reduced trading volume as the weekend mood sets in. Ethereum (ETH) price hackens to the BTC cue, with both cryptos engaging low gear. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price is rejected from a key level but maintains an overall bullish outlook.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC downside likely after 20-week EMA culls bulls\n\nBitcoin price holds below $27,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price dropped below the $27,000 psychological level, with investors digesting the FOMC meeting reports following the Federal Interest Rate decision. The current stance could be attributed to the weekend mood, or more ideally, traders having taken profits from the September 12-19 upswing and are now waiting for the next move.\n\nIt is likely that Bitcoin price could extend the slump below the $26,000 psychological level before a possible pullback with the odds of a move below the $25,229 level increasing by the day. A decisive break and close below this level would confirm the downtrend.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if the Relative Strength Index (RSI) decisively moves above 50, Bitcoin price could shatter the downtrend line at $27,210, clearing the path for more gains. This could potentially deliver BTC above the $28,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin trading volume in spot and derivatives market points to dwindling liquidity, limits price growth\n\nEthereum price follows BTC to the heel\n\nEthereum (ETH) price could have little to say as far as its next move is concerned, considering the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token has been mirroring the price action of Bitcoin for quite some time now, owing to its strong correlation with BTC.\n\nIndependently, however, Ethereum price remains bare, with momentum falling as indicated by the RSI dropping. The immediate support at $1,624 is therefore critical for ETH, as losing it would plunge it back under a confining bearish trendline. The downtrend could go as low as the $1,552 level.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOtherwise, if bullish momentum increases, Ethereum price could very well rise above the immediate hurdle at $1,682, then $1,791, with a confirmed daily candlestick close above the $1,900 likely to kickstart an uptrend. The steady climb of the AO is a good sign, with the sustained green shade solidifying the case for the bulls.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum and Bitcoin are ready to dive\n\nRipple price repels the MT\n\nRipple (XRP) price has repelled the supply zone order block's mean threshold (MT) at $0.5337. However, the overall outlook is still bullish, with the RSI inclined north and the AO steadily climbing to the positive region. Nevertheless, investors should still wait for confirmation above the aforementioned level for the uptrend to be considered plausible.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA strong rejection from the mean threshold, potentially positioning Ripple price under $0.4600 could mean the supply zone will hold as a resistance level, with the ensuing selling pressure sending Ripple price toward the foot of the latest uptrend at $0.4600. In the dire case, the downtrend could continue, with the remittance token potentially tagging the May lows at $0.4191.\n\nAlso Read: XRP is the next Bitcoin if we solve a multi-trillion-dollar problem, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse"

The volume profile shows three significant resistance areas, with the first one getting broken now. I highly doubt this is a full reversal, but a bit more upside may be in store. Would be cautious with this one overall.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the next resistance level appears to be between the price range of $0.00000078 to $0.000000820.\n\nPepe is trading for $0.000000716 at time of writing, up 16.9% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext, the trader weighs in on Bitcoin (BTC) and says the market remains unclear as key exponential moving averages (EMAs) converge just above the crypto king\u2019s price, acting as resistance.\n\n\u201cBTC one-day thoughts: overall market structure hasn\u2019t changed much IMO (in my opinion). We\u2019re still either forming some sort of weird higher low OR consolidating for the next leg down.

Gut says we move up to $28,000 in the mid-term, but I don\u2019t really know. The last recent high established in mid-July was an equal high from before and not truly a higher high IMO.\n\nI think we\u2019re still in an overall chop fest similar to 2019, where we saw a big move up and we\u2019ll see a slow grind down for the rest of 2023. Probably slow grind down IMO and then we have some good times in December/January as always.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $26,595 at time of writing, up 0.1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader says he\u2019s keeping an eye on the AI-based altcoin Worldcoin (WLD). According to Altcoin Sherpa, WLD might be in a position to witness a price dip after a brief rally as it now trades close to a key resistance level.\n\n\u201cWLD: Total shitcoin, but I think that this one makes a lower high.

        "content": "Bitcoin managed to stay above the $26,000 mark for a week.\n\nMost metrics were bullish, but a few indicators suggested otherwise.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] has managed to remain above the critical $26,000 mark for a week now. But the king of cryptos has failed to breach the $27,000 resistance level it dropped back under after spiking a few times in the last seven days.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nWhile this happened, an interesting development took place. Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with the US Dollar Index has hit a remarkable milestone of zero. Should investors look at this update with a bullish notion, or is BTC awaiting another price correction?\n\nBitcoin breaks ties with the US dollar\n\nThe latest data revealed that BTC\u2019s correlation index with the US dollar just reached zero. The metric keeps track of the linear dependence between the prices or values of any two given commodities or assets.\n\nThus, this latest development means that the US dollar\u2019s performance will have no effect on how the king of crypto performs in the near future or until the index changes again.\n\nBitcoin's correlation with the US Dollar Index has hit a remarkable milestone\u2014zero. Interestingly, there is currently almost no correlation with any of the major indices. As Bitcoin charts its own course, the question arises: is this a bullish or bearish signal?\n\nExplore More\u2026 pic.twitter.com/M5IzB6nux6 \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) September 21, 2023\n\nThough this looked positive, things could also turn nasty for BTC. Therefore, a look at BTC\u2019s metrics could help us better understand whether this development was bullish or bearish.\n\nThe NVT Signal is a key metric that uses a 90-day moving average of the daily transaction volume in the denominator. As per Glassnode Alerts\u2019 latest tweet, BTC\u2019s NVT Signal just reached a 6-month high of 1,529.771. Historically, whenever the metric rose, BTC\u2019s price followed.\n\n? #Bitcoin $BTC NVT Signal (7d MA) just reached a 6-month high of 1,529.771 Previous 6-month high of 1,529.351 was observed on 24 March 2023 View metric:https://t.co/NIjFezJMgN pic.twitter.com/WnqHIg4UJS \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) September 21, 2023\n\nA closer look at BTC\u2019s on-chain performance revealed quite a few other bullish indicators as well. For example, BTC\u2019s exchange rate was declining, meaning that the coin was not under selling pressure.\n\nIts aSORP was green, suggesting that the market was in a fear phase. Additionally, Bitcoin\u2019s binary CDD revealed that the long-term holders\u2019 movements in the last seven days were lower than average.\n\nAre Bitcoin bulls already here?\n\nThanks to the aforementioned bullish metrics, BTC managed to stay above the $26,000 mark. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $26,650.84 with a market capitalization of more than $519 billion.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nThough the metrics were bullish, a look at BTC\u2019s daily chart suggested that investors can expect a few more slow-moving days. This seemed likely as both BTC\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) took a sideways path.\n\nNonetheless, the MACD displayed a clear bullish edge in the market, which could initiate a bull rally soon."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past week, the crypto market displayed a sideways trend, influenced by various industry developments and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin started trading at the $26,000 mark and briefly surged above $27,000. However, it faced resistance around the $27,500 level, leading to a subsequent downward movement. Presently, BTC is trading at approximately $26,600. If BTC continues its decline, it may retest the support zone at $25,400. Despite experiencing a 60% decline from its all-time high, BTC has posted a 2.34% gain month-to-date and a remarkable 60% increase year-to-date.Additionally, this week the U.S. Federal Reserve convened for a meeting to discuss interest rate hikes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank would consider additional rate hikes if the economy continues to outperform expectations. The benchmark interest rate presently remains in the range of 5.25% to 5.50%. Concurrently, market participants are reacting to the U.S. benchmark 10-year note yields reaching 4.490%, the highest level since November 2007. These events have induced a bit of bearish sentiments in the markets.Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) has mirrored BTC's movements. ETH encountered bearish momentum below the $1,600 level. A breakthrough above the $1,620 resistance could propel its price toward $1,650, while a failure to clear immediate support may lead to a decline towards the $1,565 level.In an interesting turn of events, Germany's largest lender, Deutsche Bank, announced a collaboration with Swiss startup Taurus to establish digital asset custody and tokenization services, highlighting the growing involvement of traditional financial institutions in the crypto space.On a different note, Nomura, a prominent Japanese investment bank, introduced a Bitcoin-based fund catering to institutional investors. Meanwhile, Grayscale, a notable player in the crypto investment space, has submitted an application to the U.S. SEC for a new Ethereum Futures ETF, further demonstrating the continued evolution of the crypto market and its integration with traditional finance.Coming to the price action, among the top 100 cryptos by market cap, here are the best and worst-performing cryptos over the past week:As per prices on Friday.1. Immutable is up by 32%2. Toncoin is up by 20%3. Aave is up by 16%4. GMX is up by 11%5. Terra Classic is by 8%1. IOTA is down by 10%2. Gala is down by 9%3. Klaytm is down by 8%4.

        "content": "Bitcoin is on track to close the second consecutive week in the green as the price continues to retest the resolve of investors. A \u201cdegree of panic and negative sentiment has taken hold in the near term\u201d as investors who bought BTC over the last three months see their aggregate cost basis fail as market support, according to data from Glassnode.\n\nAs a result, there is an overall sense of caution among Bitcoin traders and analysts, with many predicting a test of lower levels still to come. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index reinforces these views as market \u201csentiments and emotions\u201d remain fairly bearish according to data from Alternative.\n\nNonetheless, for smallholders, Bitcoin remains an attractive investment as they accumulate more in anticipation of good returns in the long run. Sentiments analysts unveiled a trend where non-whale wallets, which are defined as \u201caddresses with under 100 $BTC\u201d, have soared to all-time highs, \u201cnow owning 41.1% of the available supply.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc33\ud83d\udcc9 #Bitcoin\u2018s non-whale wallets, defined as addresses with under 100 $BTC, have climbed to new #AllTimeHigh levels, now owning 41.1% of the available supply. Meanwhile, whales with 100 to 100K, own 55.5% of the supply, their lowest amount held since May. https://t.co/JktSd6yM6Z pic.twitter.com/f2cwYZ3MTX \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 21, 2023\n\nThis points to massive accumulation, which is a bullish sign for the holders of the big crypto.\n\nCan Bitcoin Climb 50% Before the End of the Year?\n\nBTC is trading at $26,622, down 1.67% over the last 24 hours and up 0.5% over the last seven days. On the medium timeframes, Bitcoin looks bearish as it trades at 13% and 3% down over the last three months and six months respectively.\n\nOn the longer timeframes, the pioneer cryptocurrency is optimistically bullish. It is up 61% year-to-date (YTD) and 44% over the last 12 months.\n\nFor the last five weeks, the price has still successfully managed to stay above $26,000, and even when it dips below this level, it quickly bounces back up.\n\nThis suggests the bearish wave is trying to break the support at $26k. The support is holding for now, but if it breaks the price of the flagship cryptocurrency will drop to revisit the $23,500 to $24,500 demand zone. Note that this is a strong defense zone as it is where the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the Suptrend\u2019s green line lie.\n\nBTC/USD Weekly Chart\n\nMeanwhile, the most vigorous resistance limiting Bitcoin from heading further up is at $28,000, close to the 200-day SMA. Although BTC did manage to breach it a couple of times in March and June, even going to $32,000 on one occasion, thus making a YTD high.\n\nNote that the month of September and Q3 2023 will end in just over a week. Historically, this is the worst period for crypto prices, while Q4 is usually much more bullish.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that history will repeat itself, market participants are looking forward to entering the final quarter. Not only that, but the most optimistic predictions believe that BTC might recover to $40,000 before the year ends. This would mark a 50% uptick from the current price.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

My advice to crypto boy is to get to a shitcoiners anonymous (SA) meeting and get off the shitcoin crack pipe as soon as you can. It doesn\u2019t get better. If you keep OD\u2019ing on shitcoins your\u2026 https://t.co/zTV3wIbNG9 \u2014 Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) September 20, 2023\n\nBitcoin evangelist and the advisor to El Salvador\u2019s president Nayib Bukele, went on to explain that Armstrong first has to read the White Paper and \u201cget right with Satoshi\u201d.\n\n6. Were entirely ready to have Satoshi remove all these defects of character. 7. Humbly asked him to remove our ETH & XRP 8. Made a list of all 400,000 persons we had scammed, and became willing to pay them all back. 9. Made direct payments to such people wherever possible,\u2026 \u2014 Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) September 20, 2023\n\nEven though Keiser has been predicting the Bitcoin price to achieve 100x growth, recently he stated that rising rates will continue to challenge the Bitcoin price as more capital flows into high-yielding instruments.\n\nKeiser here made a statement that seemed bearish, which is out of character for a fervent proponent of BTC maximalism. This abrupt turn-around runs counter to his earlier forecasts of Bitcoin\u2019s price growth to ranges between $220,000 and $1 million. Many of his supporters look perplexed by this about-face as they try to make sense of his incoherent remarks.\n\nDonations in BTC, ETH, and ADA\n\nArmstrong sought donations for his legal defense, receiving significant support from the crypto community shortly after. Donations started to flood in. Armstrong\u2019s mission was enthusiastically supported by backers, who generously donated sums in several cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, donations made in Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Cardano (ADA) amounted to more than $80,000 .\n\nEthereum Donations: Armstrong\u2019s Ethereum address (0xa6079bC88540cC9360D3c8D6f9cE583cdC3dC6) received a total of 32 ETH, worth $53,843.44.\n\nBitcoin contributions: At the time of writing, donations to Armstrong\u2019s Bitcoin address stood at $227.50.\n\nCardano Donations: Cardano\u2019s support for Armstrong\u2019s campaign underscores the importance of community solidarity in challenging times, despite the unverifiable trackability of ADA donations.\n\nArmstrong has been having difficulties ever since the Hit Network, a business he helped start, removed his YouTube channel and other social media accounts following allegations of drug usage and extramarital affairs. The crypto influencer, unable to use the BitBoy name, has decided to be called just \u2013 Ben.\n\nArmstrong solicited donations at three different addresses: a Bitcoin address, a Cardano address, and an Ethereum address. He claimed to be in need. The greatest donation to yet looks to be approximately 11,000 USDT from an unidentified source.\n\n\u201cThe fact is I was under duress, I\u2019ve been under duress.\u201d Armstrong said in the latest livestream, \u201clike, when people see what they did to me with this Lamborghini, trying to bleed me out, that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nHit Network took possession of Armstrong\u2019s Lamborghini Huracan Performante because it was registered in their name.\n\nThe influencer explicitly stated that he would not return the funds he is collecting as a \u201clegal fund\u201d to the donors."

        "content": "In the past years, it has been possible to observe a gradual, but constant trend of fewer Bitcoin (BTC) mining pools dominating the majority of the global network hashrate and block discovery. In this report, Finbold uses a data-based approach to analyze the decentralization state of the leading cryptocurrency network and explains why it is important.\n\nGoing from an unknown number of Bitcoin miners having the majority of its hashrate since the first block was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, to four mining pools having mined over 59% of all blocks in the last three years, and only two of these institutions dominating over 52% of the new BTC distribution in the last three months.\n\nBitcoin mining decentralization state\n\nThis data was gathered from mempool.space pools ranking, which analyses the hashrate dominance by looking at who was responsible for each block ever added to the Bitcoin blockchain in each timeframe. Consequently receiving the reward in BTC through the creation of new coins \u2014 until the maximum limit of 21 million is achieved in the next 120 years (approximately).\n\nAll-time Bitcoin blocks discovery\n\nAt the time of publication, a total of 808987 Bitcoin blocks were mined and added to the blockchain. Resulting in a total of 19,493,656 BTC being distributed to each of the lucky miners (or mining pools) that discovered each of these blocks by providing Proof of Work (PoW) through hash calculations.\n\nInterestingly, from these 808,987 blocks, 220,716 (27.29%) were mined by unknown entities \u2014 mostly in the early days of the network, probably by individual and domestic miners, or yet unidentified mining companies.\n\nBitcoin mining all-time pools ranking.

Bitcoin domestic mining is not feasible anymore, smaller companies are not able to survive while operating underwater, and the remaining survivors get more concentrated in fewer pools for even higher revenue predictability.\n\nIn the last three months, only two mining pools received more than half of all the Bitcoin supply distribution which is set as 6.25 BTC per mined block \u2014 that happens on average every 10 minutes, for around 900 BTC/day.\n\nFoundry USA received around 24,831.25 BTC for mining 3,973 blocks (29.66%), while AntPool received around 19,018.75 BTC for mining 3,043 blocks (22.72%). This results in a total of 43,850 BTC accrued by these pools in the last 90 days, equal to $1.16 billion considering Bitcoin is priced at $26.500 by press time.\n\nBitcoin mining 3-month (3M) pools ranking.

It also diminishes the effect of a single entity sell-off, as seen recently by F2Pool \u2014 currently the third largest mining pool.\n\nBitcoin: Miner reserve \u2013 F2Pool.

It is the pool coordinator who adds transactions to the block template, signs and broadcasts the block to the network, and receives the block reward to be distributed later among the miners.\n\nAll things considered, the more decentralized cryptocurrencies\u2019 networks are, the more secure and valuable they can become long-term."
