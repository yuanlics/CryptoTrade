        "title": "Bitcoin mining energy use doubled in 2023 as crypto prices rose - S&P Global",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency mining rigs use large amounts of energy to cool and operate.\n\nSource: South_agency/E+ via Getty Images.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal energy consumption from bitcoin mining has grown 101% since Jan. 1 to reach 141.2 TWh as of Dec. 20, according to data from Digiconomist, a platform managed by Dutch economist and blockchain expert Alex de Vries.\n\nThe US is one of the largest bitcoin miners in the world, a separate analysis by the University of Cambridge estimated.\n\nThe rise in power demand reflects a rebound in bitcoin prices from a low of $16,611 on Jan. 1 to top $44,000 on Dec. 20. Observers attribute the rise in prices to the Federal Reserve signaling an end to rate increases and investors anticipating a bitcoin exchange-traded fund getting approval from US regulators in 2024, among other things.\n\n\"There's a very direct relationship between prices and electricity consumption,\" de Vries said in an interview. \"The more the value of the resource goes up, the more the miners are paid and the more they mine.\"\n\nAs bitcoin prices continue to move higher by the day, de Vries predicted, the industry's footprint will likely grow even more before the end of the year. But he stressed that the trajectory can change suddenly, if bitcoin's turbulent history is any indication.\n\nThe global crypto mining industry currently consumes as much electricity annually as Ukraine, Digiconomist estimated, and emits 78.7 million metric tons of CO 2 per year, as much as the nation of Oman.\n\nEnvironmental impacts are not limited to the energy the industry consumed from power plants burning fossil fuels. A paper de Vries published in late November in the journal Cell Reports Sustainability analyzed water usage from cooling power plants that produce electricity for bitcoin mining and water used to cool mining datacenters.\n\nAs mining continues to grow, the total US water use in 2023 could reach the equivalent of 27 billion gallons, the study estimated. That is about what Washington, DC, households use in a year, it said.\n\nLawmakers react\n\nBitcoin mining companies use powerful computers housed in sprawling datacenters to verify, process and record cryptocurrency transactions. A single bitcoin transaction using the \"proof-of-work\" process today requires 705 kWh of electricity, according to Digiconomist. By comparison, Ethereum uses 0.02 kWh after switching to a new approach in September 2022 known as \"proof of stake,\" cutting energy use 99%.\n\nNew York in 2022 imposed a two-year moratorium on bitcoin mining over concerns that the industry was using up too much of the state's renewable energy resources. Members of Congress have also voiced concerns over the industry's impact.\n\nA bill reintroduced by Senate Democrats in March called on the US Environmental Protection Agency to issue a rulemaking requiring cryptocurrency mining operations that use more than 5 MW of power annually and emit greenhouse gas emissions exceeding 25,000 metric tons to monitor and report such emissions. The bill never made it out of committee.\n\nThe same month, Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) sponsored an opposite resolution declaring that \"energy development should be a key pillar to the growth of the United States economy, infrastructure, and national security, and Proof-of-Work mining can help develop advancements in all of these sectors.\"\n\nIndustry lobbyists weigh in\n\nBy August, the bitcoin mining industry had established an advocacy group in Washington, the Digital Energy Council, with a message that digital asset mining can help stabilize the electric grid. In October, another trade group, the Digital Power Network, lobbied Congress in support of Sessions' resolution.\n\n\"We met with nearly 40 members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, sharing tangible, real-world examples that underscore how the bitcoin mining industry is playing a pivotal role in advancing America's energy security in four significant ways: grid stability, national security, decarbonization and sustainability,\" Perianne Boring, CEO of the Chamber of Digital Commerce and organizer of the network's lobbying event, said in a release at the time.\n\nThe industry is also pointing to miners that invest in their own renewable energy sources to power datacenters, or that employ underutilized power sources that might otherwise go to waste. In Texas, the epicenter of US bitcoin mining, companies also take advantage of the state's demand response programs to help conserve energy during peak demand.\n\nRiot Platforms Inc., the largest bitcoin miner operating in Texas, collected $49.6 million in power curtailment credits from Texas during the third quarter, more than it made from mining, the company reported.\n\nTo date, however, no independent analysis has shown that the industry is getting greener or shrinking its carbon footprint, de Vries said.\n\nS&P Global Commodity Insights produces content for distribution on S&P Capital IQ Pro."

In its wake, myriad smaller tokens ranging from Sam Bankman-Fried -backed Solana to dog- and frog-themed memecoins took off as investors embraced risk again.

        "title": "An NYC bathhouse is mining Bitcoin to heat its pools\u2014and score a \u201crebate\u201d on its $20,000-a-month energy bill - Fortune",
        "content": "On the surface, Bathhouse is a classic Brooklyn wellness hangout. The city\u2019s spa-ficionados make the trek to Williamsburg and pay upwards of $45 a day to soak in its pools, relax in its saunas, and socialize with other peak performers.\n\nBut beneath the wellness oasis lies a hidden operation: a dozen Bitcoin mining units are churning away 24/7 to power the spa\u2019s two heated pools.\n\nInside the 11,000-square-foot refurbished factory, Bathhouse began its pre-crypto days in 2019 with three thermal pools (one hot, one tepid, one cold), two saunas, a steam room, and two hammams\u2014heated marble stones for patrons to lay on. The permanently toasty environment translates to a whole lot of energy use.\n\n\u201cOur ConEd bill kind of makes us want to throw up,\u201d Bathhouse cofounder Travis Talmadge recently told Fortune.\n\nBathhouse began mining Bitcoin on its premises in 2021, using miners as \u201cfancy pool heaters\u201d to generate cryptocurrency in addition to heat. Miners now power its two heated pools using residual heat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically in the heat-delivery business, or that\u2019s a big portion of what we do,\u201d Talmadge said. \u201cThe ability to pull heat off of mining Bitcoin made all the sense in the world\u2014like we get a rebate for the energy that we buy.\u201d\n\nFrom dingy to designer\n\nTalmadge met his cofounder, Jason Goodman, in 2014 thanks to a serendipitous Airbnb booking. Talmadge was vacationing at a property Goodman owned in Montauk, and the pair struck up a friendship over campfire hangouts on the beach.\n\nGoodman had been going to New York City bathhouses for post-gym recovery for years, and was mulling over starting one of his own. In 2016, Talmadge tagged along on one of his visits\u2014and became an instant convert. \u201cI get it now,\u201d he remembers saying.\n\nGoodman and Talmadge, who have backgrounds in real estate and in institutional brokerage, respectively, loved the communal wellness experience but were frustrated by the \u201cdingy\u201d quality of some bathhouses. They saw an opportunity to update the 5,000-year-old tradition for a modern crowd.\n\n\u201cNobody was doing it from a place of New York City\u2019s best hospitality standards, and from a place of modern design standards,\u201d Goodman said.\n\nDown the rabbit hole\n\nWhile considering various ways to \u201ctrim the fat\u201d of the business\u2014particularly its \u201cstaggering\u201d $20,000-per-month energy bill\u2014Goodman and Talmadge each developed an interest in cryptocurrency, which Goodman chased down several YouTube rabbit holes.\n\nIn mid-2021, he came across a video of a man in middle America who had figured out how to heat his pool by mining Bitcoin. He sent the video to Talmadge with no additional context. \u201cOh my God, this makes the most sense in the world,\u201d Talmadge remembers thinking.\n\nThey started running experiments with two miners made from off-the-shelf parts from Home Depot, PlumbingSupply.com, and DCX. In late 2021, they scaled up the operation to power the two heated pools in Bathhouse\u2019s Williamsburg location using 12 Bitcoin miners that generate about 1,200 terahashes per second.\n\nAt Bathhouse\u2019s location in the Flatiron District that\u2019s set to open in the new year, all four hot pools and three hammams will be heated by 14 bigger, better Bitcoin miners at a 2,600-terahash-per-second rate.\n\nBack to ASICs\n\nBathhouse uses off-the-shelf ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuit)\u2014essentially computers designed specifically for Bitcoin mining. \u201cThey have a huge problem\u2014they have to dump heat,\u201d Goodman said.\n\nAt Bathhouse, Goodman and Talmadge converted the miners for immersion cooling instead of air-cooling. \u201cWe strip the fans off, we put them in a special dielectric fluid,\u201d Talmadge explains. \u201cAnd so now, instead of that heat going into the air or being hot to touch on your computer, it\u2019s much more powerful than that. It goes and heats the oil around it, and then you pull that heat out eventually on a heat exchanger.\u201d\n\nThe heat exchanger on the tank has four ports: hot oil in, cold oil out, cold water in, and hot water out. The water from the \u201chot water out\u201d port runs in a loop from the heat exchangers on the mining tanks to the heat exchangers in the pool plumbing, recycling the energy used by the miners to heat the water in the pools.\n\nCourtesy of Bathhouse\n\nBull market\n\nGoodman and Talmadge say Bathhouse\u2019s energy bills have not changed much compared to the pre-crypto days.\n\n\u201cWe have to buy this energy anyway,\u201d Talmadge said. \u201cWhereas before, we got just heat out of it. Now we\u2019re getting heat, and we\u2019re getting assets.\u201d\n\nBathhouse does not have any plans to sell the Bitcoin it mines. Instead, proceeds are stored in self-custody as the property of the company.\n\n\u201cWe are not trying to recover our energy costs necessarily with Bitcoin,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cWe want to treasury the Bitcoin because we\u2019re long-term believers in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMoral compass\n\nIn June, Bathhouse posted an Instagram Reel explaining its mining process. Users flocked to the comment section, voicing their concerns about the environmental impact of mining cryptocurrency and asking Bathhouse for more transparency. Bitcoin is estimated to consume 127 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy a year\u2014more than some countries, including Norway, according to the Rocky Mountain Institute.\n\n\u201cI think this is an important topic,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cWho decides which use of energy is moral, and which use of energy is not moral? Why is a pool heater a moral use of energy and a Bitcoin miner not?\u201d\n\nGoodman and Talmadge pointed to the massive amounts of energy used by internet servers, the stock market, and even mobile phones\u2014and reiterated that Bathhouse is buying the same amount of energy as it did before it began mining Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI would argue that Bitcoin is a very moral use of energy,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cBecause having fair and equitable money is a very important thing for society.\u201d\n\nTo the moon\n\nGoodman and Talmadge hope to see more businesses mine cryptocurrency on their premises. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of use cases for this,\u201d Talmadge said. \u201cYou could heat all the domestic hot water in a building with Bitcoin miners. Hotels, anybody with big pools.\u201d\n\nFollowing the opening of its new 36,500-square-foot location in the Flatiron District, where a day pass will cost $70 on weekdays and $85 on weekends, Bathhouse has plans to expand to Chicago and other cities. And yes, they\u2019ll be bringing the Bitcoin miners with them.\n\n\u201cOur plan is to continue building great bathhouses, continue heating our pools by recycling heat from mining operations, continue to treasury that,\u201d said Goodman. \u201cTo go along for the ride.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin leaves the rest of the crypto market behind - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Fintech myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nHello and welcome to the final edition this year of the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week, we\u2019re looking at the digital coin that bitcoin is threatening to leave behind. We\u2019ll be back on January 13th.\n\nOne common \u2014 and not always unfair \u2014 criticism made by crypto enthusiasts is that the wider world conflates bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf the subject comes up over Christmas, chances are family and friends will use the two interchangeably. In their minds bitcoin IS the crypto market. Yet people working around it, or even have more than a passing interest, know there is much more going on.\n\nRight now, bitcoin is in a happier place than it has been for 18 months, supported by speculation that the SEC will approve a bitcoin exchange traded fund after Christmas. But the rest of the market doesn\u2019t quite have that same warm fuzzy feeling.\n\nA large chunk of \u201cthe rest\u201d is ether, the second largest cryptocurrency on the market, because of the blockchain it represents, ethereum.\n\nEthereum has always been a more ambitious project than the bitcoin blockchain, which is a database for transactions. It can hold assets and lets programmers code functions for buying and selling into smart contracts. That means it is the foundation for so much of the industry\u2019s non-bitcoin activity ranging from decentralised finance (DeFi) projects and NFTs to gaming.\n\nHistorically, these markets have given ethereum a unique position of strength over competing blockchains: if one sector of the industry explodes, so should ether.\n\nBut while ether has climbed a respectable 93 per cent this year, it has underperformed bitcoin (up 162 per cent), Solana (up over 550 per cent), and Cardano (up 154 per cent).\n\n\u201cThis year ether has been totally outshined by the excitement related to bitcoin,\u201d said CK Zheng, co-founder and chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund ZK Squared Capital.\n\nFor ether, the problem is that these cutting-edge crypto projects, like decentralised finance, NFTs and gaming \u2014 the ethereum network\u2019s bread and butter \u2014 still haven\u2019t shaken off their past.\n\nProjects like DeFi crypto exchange Uniswap have yet to generate any mainstream buzz, crypto-inspired games like Axie Infinity are today synonymous with North Korean hacking exploits, and NFTs have only recently made headlines for blinding party goers in Hong Kong.\n\nAs far as the non-bitcoin crypto market is concerned, the coins that have performed best this year are the ones exploring the links between crypto and artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe demand for AI investments has found its way into crypto,\u201d said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive at investment adviser at Lumida Wealth Management. \u201cCrypto tokens linked to AI have emerged as one of the strongest crypto investing themes,\u201d he added.\n\nWhether there are overlaps between crypto and AI is a theme for another day. For now, they are the kingfishers catching the sunlight. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to see the far superior returns of AI-related tokens compared to other tokens,\u201d added Zheng, adding that these tokens will be \u201cthe most exciting theme going into 2024.\u201d\n\nBut ethereum\u2019s lacklustre year behind bitcoin is not all down to being superseded by the latest tech hype cycle. US regulators are still pursuing cases that could end up defining ether and other crypto tokens as securities.\n\nAnd ethereum also has to face up to its own disappointments. In September last year the network underwent a supposedly revolutionary surgery with the \u201cMerge\u201d. It was a technical operation, blending one ethereum blockchain with another, but came with big promises.\n\nBefore the Merge, if the ethereum network were a country, it would have ranked in the world\u2019s top 35 by energy consumption, surpassing nations like Belgium and Finland.\n\nThe Merge virtually eliminated the network\u2019s carbon footprint, and when I dedicated 2,500 words to ethereum\u2019s supposed revolution, everyone I spoke to told me it was the removal of the biggest obstacle to mainstream adoption. Ether would even come on to the radars of ESG-conscious investors.\n\nIn fact, the anticipation for a record-setting future was so intense that YouTube\u2019s former head of gaming Ryan Wyatt told me that crypto could soon focus on \u201conboarding the next billion users.\u201d\n\nBut the price of ether fell in the months after the Merge, and while it has recovered, those billion users haven\u2019t materialised.\n\n\u201cIf the expectation was that the Merge would boost investments from ESG-minded investors I think that expectation would be premature,\u201d said Alex de Vries, co-founder of Digiconomist, a website that tracks the environmental impact of the crypto industry.\n\nInstead, ether is at risk of being eclipsed by bitcoin. At the time of the Merge, bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation represented roughly 40 per cent of the entire crypto market and ethereum\u2019s share was 18 per cent, according to industry data aggregator CoinMarketCap.\n\nToday ethereum accounts for 17 per cent while bitcoin\u2019s share has expanded to 52 per cent.\n\nIf conversations with family and friends this Christmas do veer down the cryptocurrency road, good luck in explaining it. And even better luck in explaining how it\u2019s not all about bitcoin.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on ether\u2019s future? As always, email me your thoughts at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nEarlier this week failed crypto exchange FTX settled with its debtors after its collapse in November last year. The agreement, subject to the approvals of the US bankruptcy court and Supreme Court of The Bahamas, will pool the assets of the FTX debtors and exchange\u2019s Bahamian unit to ensure customers receive \u201csubstantially identical relative distributions.\u201d\n\nETF speculation heated up yet again this week when BlackRock \u2014 the largest asset manager in the world \u2014 disclosed in a fresh filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its proposed fund would only allow new shares to be created with cash, instead of bitcoin. The move, while hardly groundbreaking, was taken as yet another sign that the Wall Street giant is making headway with the regulator.\n\nSoundbite of the week: A big freeze from the BVI\n\nRemember Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, founders of collapsed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital? Sadly the courts won\u2019t leave them alone to continue painting and surfing.\n\nA court in the British Virgin Islands this week issued a worldwide freezing order hitting over $1bn of their assets. The order also goes after Kelly Chen, Davies\u2019s wife, representing the latest effort by the liquidators to return assets to creditors of the collapsed business.\n\nThe order turns up the heat on the disgraced founders by closing as many possible avenues available to access funds. Zhu was imprisoned in Singapore in September for four months for failing to co-operate with investigations into Three Arrows\u2019 failure; the whereabouts of Davies remains unknown.\n\n\u201cThe order is specifically designed to prevent the founders and Ms Kelly Chen from disposing of or otherwise dealing with assets in any way that might frustrate eventual enforcement by the liquidators.\u201d\n\nData Mining: Tether\u2019s Christmas naughty list\n\nLast month Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin, signed up the US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the US Secret Service to help prevent illicit use of its USDT token.\n\nUnsurprisingly the number of blacklisted Tether wallets has shot higher. Total numbers of banned wallets are up 20 per cent to 1,236 so far this month, according to CCData.\n\nFT Cryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford.

        "title": "SEC holds calls with spot bitcoin ETF hopefuls as possible approval nears - Fox Business",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is wasting no time preparing the financial industry for possibly the biggest regulatory event in the history of the $1.6 trillion crypto market: The potential approval of a \"spot\" bitcoin ETF in the new year.\n\nSEC staffers held separate telephone conference calls with spot bitcoin ETF hopefuls on Thursday afternoon, FOX Business has learned. The calls involved some minutiae on the application process, but also delivered a definitive message on how the ETFs need to be structured. The agency staffers said the SEC will only consider applications that structure an ETF that allows issuers to only buy the product using cash instead of so-called \"in kind\" purchases using bitcoin. Similarly, redemptions of the ETF must be provided only in cash.\n\nAny mention of in-kind purchases or redemptions must be stricken from the application, SEC staffers said, FOX Business has learned.\n\nSEC COULD MAKE CRYPTO HISTORY IN NEW YEAR WITH FIRST SPOT BITCOIN ETF APPROVAL\n\nThe cash-only structure is key for the SEC and has been controversial for the money managers seeking approval. Most other ETFs allow both in-kind purchases and redemptions as well as cash. But the SEC believes that bitcoin ETFs present additional regulatory challenges not found in such plain vanilla offerings. It\u2019s demanding cash only because it\u2019s worried about possible malfeasance involved in using crypto for purchases and redemptions. Additionally, the agency doesn\u2019t currently allow broker-dealers to trade spot bitcoin directly like it does other commodities.\n\nAt least two money managers are seeking SEC approval for the product: BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, and crypto asset manager Grayscale have been hesitant to give up the fight for in-kind creations, arguing that the process is more efficient and will result in a more robust trading market.\n\nVALKYRIE INVESTMENTS FIRST TO OFFER ETHER FUTURES THROUGH ETF\n\nFOX Business was first to report about the SEC's outreach. It is unclear whether the SEC called all prospective issuers of the spot bitcoin ETF, but FOX Business confirmed that calls were held with BlackRock, Valkyrie, Grayscale, Ark 21Shares and Bitwise.

However, the SEC is a government agency, and many staffers will be off over the Christmas period.

The SEC could reject the applications, of course, given Chairman Gary Gensler's long-held criticism of the digital coin market as the \"wild west\" of investing and rife with fraud, typified by the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the conviction of its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nStill, based on conversations with the SEC staff, asset managers remain confident that a favorable decision from the SEC will be made on or before Jan. 10, as FOX Business first reported Wednesday.

        "title": "Unveiling the factors impacting bitcoin's price - Omaha World-Herald",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency has emerged as a promising investment channel for traders, entrepreneurs, and investors alike. However, volatility remains the hallmark of the crypto market, making it challenging for even seasoned investors to assess the price swings of digital currencies. The giant cryptocurrency Bitcoin is no exception here. Deciphering the value of Bitcoin poses its challenges, but experts propose that staying vigilant about factors influencing the digital currency's worth can yield insights. Let's delve into the intricacies of Bitcoin to better understand the question \"What is the price of Bitcoin?\" and assess its potential valuation.\n\nSupply and Demand\n\nThe fundamental economic principle of supply and demand forms the core of Bitcoin's price determination. With a limited supply of 21 million, Bitcoin can create a scarcity factor that will, in turn, influence its market price. When more investors flock to own this decentralized digital gold, the demand for Bitcoin soars. On the contrary, when the demand dwindles, the price also experiences a corresponding decline.\n\nThe scarcity of Bitcoin, despite its growing popularity as a digital asset, can affect the supply and demand dynamics of the currency. Investors, closely tracking these fluctuations, gauge market sentiment to make informed decisions. This makes the supply and demand of Bitcoin a delicate equilibrium that shapes its valuation.\n\nCost of Production\n\nBitcoin mining is the process through which new Bitcoins are created and transactions are verified. What is the price of Bitcoin? The cost of production includes expenses such as electricity, hardware, and maintenance. These expenses determine the minimum threshold at which miners are willing to sell their newly minted bitcoins. When the market price dips below this threshold, miners are likely to slow down, potentially constraining the supply to create an upward curve of Bitcoin price.\n\nDuring bullish market conditions, the price of Bitcoin surpasses the cost of production. In such a scenario, miners are incentivized to accelerate their activities to meet the overall supply. This intricate balance between production costs and market value can directly impact Bitcoin price.\n\nAvailability on Exchanges\n\nCrypto exchanges act as the marketplace for crypto buyers and sellers where the ease of trading impacts liquidity and price discovery. This is where Bitcoin price can be impacted based on its availability in various cryptocurrency exchanges. Popular platforms like CNN Money, Financial Times, Binance, and Investopedia have contributed significantly to the market dynamics of Bitcoin.\n\nWith the surging demands of Bitcoin, its availability on these exchanges becomes a crucial factor. Limited availability in such market conditions can trigger prices as buyers compete for the finite supply. On the other hand, more than adequate availability can lead to price stabilization or even corrections. Traders tracking exchange dynamics will scrutinize order books and liquidity levels, often leading them to ask, \"What is the price of Bitcoin at present, and what will it be in the coming months?\"\n\nCrypto exchanges also act as the gateway to the world of digital assets. Apart from providing liquidity and accessibility to Bitcoins, these platforms also act as trendsetters, introducing new assets and advanced trading features that impact market sentiment and influence investors' decisions. Inclusions, such as listing new tokens or integrating innovative technologies, can spike Bitcoin's price as it facilitates the trading of giant currencies on the platform.\n\nCompetition with other Cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin might have dominated the crypto space for a while, but even this giant currency faces stiff competition from numerous altcoins. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin vie for market share and investor attention. The competitive environment directly influences Bitcoin's price as investors try to allocate funds across different digital assets to minimize risks.\n\nRecent advancements in blockchain technology and the introduction of several new crypto projects can divert attention and funds away from Bitcoin. This can dwindle its market dominance, affecting Bitcoin's valuation.\n\nGovernance and Regulatory Policies\n\nThe regulatory landscape can significantly influence the price of Bitcoin. As there are no globally accepted regulations on crypto transactions, Government policies, legal frameworks, and country-specific regulatory decisions can impact the adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin. Clarity in regulatory frameworks provides a sense of security to investors and financial institutions, leading the cryptocurrency to thrive.\n\nSimilarly, uncertainty or restrictive regulations can decline Bitcoin acceptance, leading to increased volatility and price swings. The regulatory backdrop is a critical factor that directly or indirectly influences all other factors that determine the price of Bitcoin.\n\nSeveral factors determine Bitcoin's price while also impacting the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. Supply and demand dynamics, production costs, exchange availability, competition, governance, and regulatory framework form the basic analytical factors that have the potential to influence Bitcoin's price. As investors and crypto enthusiasts continue to invest in Bitcoin, closely examining all these factors can help them make informed decisions to minimize financial risks.\n\nInformation is intended for educational purposes only and is not to be used as investment advice.

        "content": "Argentina's Foreign Minister Claims New Decree Legalizes Bitcoin and Other Crypto Assets for Contracts and Payments\n\nDiana Mondino, Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Trade, and Worship, has asserted that a recently passed decree legalizing the use of certain currencies in contracts and for payments applies to Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn a December 21 post on Twitter, Mondino stated that the \"Bases for the Reconstruction of the Argentine Economy\" decree, approved on December 20, allows for the use of BTC and other cryptos in the country under specific conditions.\n\nWhile the decree does not explicitly mention cryptocurrencies, it includes provisions that allow debtors to pay in currencies not recognized as legal tender in Argentina. \"We ratify and confirm that in Argentina contracts can be settled in Bitcoin,\" Mondino said. \"And also any other crypto.\"\n\nArticle 1196 of the decree states that parties have the liberty to specify the amounts and type of currency used for bonds or security deposits, as well as the method for reimbursement upon the lease's conclusion.\n\nThe decree follows the election of President Javier Milei, who appointed Mondino as foreign minister. Milei's victory was seen as a positive sign for crypto adoption in Argentina, given his previous statements supporting Bitcoin and his belief in the private sector's role in money creation. Milei came to power amid pressing inflation in the country, and the economic decree was part of his first national address, detailing measures to address Argentina's economic concerns.\n\nWhile Milei has not publicly spoken about digital assets since taking office, his appointment of Mondino and the inclusion of crypto-friendly provisions in the decree suggest a potential shift in Argentina's stance on cryptocurrencies.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "The spot bitcoin ETF race could quickly reach your 401(k) retirement plan - CNBC",
        "content": "Paul Yeung | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nRight now, interest in bitcoin is high. The cryptocurrency is up over 150% this year after a dismal 2022, and the spot bitcoin ETF race has helped push its value higher. But it remains an extremely volatile asset class with as many enemies as true believers. Many major pension funds have earmarked dollars to crypto as an asset class in recent years. According to the 2022 CFA Institute Investor Trust Study, 94% of state and local pension plans had some crypto exposure. Fidelity Investments, the largest 401(k) plan administrator in the U.S., first added a bitcoin fund option in the fall of 2022 to allow employees who are comfortable with the risks and volatility of cryptocurrency to invest in bitcoin within their company-sponsored 401(k) plan. Here's what retirement savers who do see long-term potential in cryptocurrency as an asset class need to know about the potential use cases for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOptions to own crypto in retirement accounts are limited\n\nMany employers have been hesitant to offer crypto in a 401(k) based on 2022 guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor, according to industry experts. With options to own crypto within retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs being limited, most people who own crypto today do so outside of retirement accounts. Many take a self-custody approach or use an exchange such as Coinbase or Gemini. Options are also available in nonretirement accounts at Fidelity and Betterment, for example. Accordingly, retirement savers seeking to hold crypto assets in a retirement account typically need to find a self-directed provider that allows crypto investments, and that list is also limited. Once spot bitcoin ETFs are approved, however, expect more providers to allow them, and more options for retirement savers to invest in this fashion, say industry experts.\n\nIf SEC approves over Department of Labor concerns, what happens next\n\nAssuming the SEC gives an affirmative nod to spot bitcoin ETFs, as expected, more companies might decide to offer it within their 401(k) lineup, said Steven T. Larsen, a certified financial planner and founder of Columbia Advisory Partners in Spokane, Washington. The question is how many. The Department of Labor doesn't prohibit crypto in company retirement plans, but in its March 2022 guidance, \"it put a pretty heavy thumb on the scale for plan sponsors considering it,\" said Joshua Rubin, vice president of legal at Betterment. \"At this early stage in the history of cryptocurrencies, the Department has serious concerns about the prudence of a fiduciary's decision to expose a 401(k) plan's participants to direct investments in cryptocurrencies, or other products whose value is tied to cryptocurrencies,\" the Department of Labor wrote in a compliance assistance release.\n\nwatch now\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF may solve some of the hesitancies the DOL outlined, including concerns related to custody and recordkeeping and valuation, Rubin said. Still, employers may be hesitant to jump on board, at least initially, some industry watchers said. \"Employers will be very reticent about being the first ones out there to allow this,\" said Tim Picciott, a CFP with Lexington, Massachusetts-based Innovative Advisory Group. \"I don't see most HR departments and plan trustees just signing on. I think it's going to have to be a move from the workers\" asking for it, he said.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs likely to 'be everywhere'\n\nWhile market-leading custodians such as Schwab and Fidelity don't allow investors to invest directly in cryptocurrencies within individual retirement accounts, they have become more involved in the crypto market on multiple fronts, from venture investments both financial services giants made in a crypto trading infrastructure company to a thematic crypto fund launched by Schwab. But to invest directly, retirement investors need to work with other providers such as Bitcoin IRA, BitIRA and iTrustCapital. However, market watchers predict more mainstream custodians will offer spot bitcoin ETFs once they become available. \"It will be everywhere once these come out,\" said Larsen, who is also the founder of Defi Steward, which helps investment advisors manage digital assets for clients. \"This is great for people who want exposure to bitcoin as an asset class,\" he said.\n\nTax advantages for long-term crypto investors\n\nThere are a lot of factors that go into whether bitcoin has a place in your retirement portfolio. First and foremost, bitcoin is extremely volatile and many investors don't have the risk appetite to invest even a portion of their retirement dollars in this emerging asset class. Investors also need to consider whether they want to hold bitcoin directly in a self-directed IRA, or solo 401(k), if applicable, or invest in bitcoin through an ETF. With a spot bitcoin ETF, having a professional manager who is going to be diversifying access to crypto could lessen \u2014 though not eliminate \u2014 risk, said Mark Parthemer, chief wealth strategist at Glenmede, a wealth management firm.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nOn the other hand, there can be advantages to owning bitcoin directly through a self-directed IRA, Kline said. For instance, when it comes time to take your withdrawals after age 59\u00bd, you may be able to receive your distribution as the crypto asset itself, instead of taking the cash. When you sell the spot bitcoin ETF, the redemption would likely be for cash, he said. It's an approach the SEC regards as safer. In either case, there can be tax advantages for long-term investors who invest in crypto through a retirement account versus a brokerage account, Parthemer said. Assuming the investment increases dramatically, a retirement account allows investors to avoid the tax at the time of sale. If it's in a Roth IRA and you meet the holdings requirements, the withdrawals aren't subject to tax. By contrast, if you held it in a regular brokerage account and sold it, you could be subject to capital gains taxes at the time of sale, Parthemer said.\n\nOptions if your employer won't offer a spot bitcoin ETF\n\nIf your employer won't offer a spot bitcoin ETF in its 401(k) plan, you could always ask your employer to reconsider. If the answer is no, you can still open an IRA with a provider that makes spot bitcoin ETFs available. The new spot bitcoin ETFs will be eligible for use in all types of IRA accounts \u2014 deductible, nondeductible, Roth and SEP, as well as solo 401(k) plans, said Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Services, in an email."

I'm Sarah Crespi. This is our last episode of the year, and we get to hear what happens when you make a cryptocurrency legal tender. Researcher, Diana Van Patten, joins me to discuss what happened after El Salvador adopted Bitcoin in 2021. But first, the hunt for the elusive Majorana fermion particle. With freelance science writer, Zack Savitsky, we talk about why so many think something like the Majorana is the best bet for a functional quantum computer. Zack also tells the mysterious tale of the disappearance of the particle's namesake, Ettore Majorana.\n\n[music]\n\n0:00:57.4\n\nZack Savitsky: Reclusive and disaffected physicist Ettore Majorana liked to work in the shadows. But after his friend, Emilio Segr\u00e8 dragged him into Enrico Fermi's elite Roman physics club in the late 1920s, Majorana's stature in atomic physics quickly grew. His mostly unpublished premonitions were eerily prescient. Among others, he famously intuited the existence of the neutron from prior experiments. And in 1937, he conjured up a completely new kind of particle. Physicists had learned that every fundamental particle seems to have an antimatter counterpart, an idea that Segr\u00e8 would later earn a Nobel Prize for verifying. Majorana realized the equation that leads to this duality could also describe a single particle with identical matter and antimatter personas, making it prone to annihilate itself. This hypothetical particle became known as the Majorana fermion.\n\n0:01:55.6\n\nSC: Hello, Zack. Welcome back to the Science Podcast. I guess my first question is, how much do you think we need to understand about quantum physics to understand the story?\n\n0:02:05.4\n\nZS: I think it depends on which part of the story you want to understand. But we certainly don't need to do a whole crash course right now.\n\n0:02:13.1\n\nSC: Yeah. I really do feel like the themes and the characters and the sequence of events can almost be abstracted away from the physics. And it's still a really interesting story. But I think we should start with, what is Majorana fermion?\n\n0:02:29.9\n\nZS: Ettore Majorana proposed this idea that there could exist a particle that was its own antiparticle. And that has caught on as with the moniker Majorana fermion. What happens when you bring like an electron and a positron together is that they annihilate. And if you were to bring two Majorana fermions together because they are their own antiparticle, they would annihilate as well.\n\n0:02:51.6\n\nSC: We're talking about Majorana and his titular fermion today. Because millions of dollars and decades of time have been spent searching for either Majorana fermions or something very similar to them. Researchers and industry are particularly interested in using something Majorana-like to form the basis of a quantum computer.\n\n0:03:12.3\n\nZS: Yeah. So I think one thing to emphasize throughout this is that what they're trying to make in the quantum computer is like an equivalent of the Majorana fermion, but it's not a fundamental particle in the way that a Majorana particle would be. And that is a really important distinction because if Majorana fermions do exist in nature as like elementary particles, they could not form the basis of a computer.\n\n0:03:38.2\n\nSC: Okay, so we'll just call them Majoranas from here on out. And that's gonna denote something like a Majorana fermion, but not exactly that fundamental particle. Okay, let's get into quantum computing now.\n\n0:03:51.1\n\nZS: The idea for building a quantum computer has been around for decades. And the general concept is that, rather than relying on the little electrical switches called transistors to encode zeros and ones as information, which is how the basis of all modern computing works, you could encode those zeros and ones in different properties of sub-atomic objects. So that could be an atom or an electron and the thing that you're encoding, it could be a property like its spin or its polarity. That allows you to harness these weird quantum laws to, in principle at least, do computations in a fundamentally different way.\n\n0:04:34.6\n\nZS: In order for a quantum computer to do the computation, you need to have a bunch of these qubits that are entangled with each other, which is this weird quantum phenomenon in which different particles that are separated in space can share properties. That's really useful for doing these computations sort of simultaneously, but the problem is that those particles can also entangle with the environment around them. And that when that happens, you mess up the computation. And so what you want to do is have entanglement between the qubits, but not entanglement between the qubits and the rest of the world.\n\n0:05:13.4\n\nSC: Okay. And this is where we learned that entanglement is something like fire.\n\n0:05:19.8\n\nZS: One of my sources, physicist Charlie Marcus, has a really nice way of describing this. He talks about it as akin to learning to control fire. Humans, when we first started using fire, there was this problem that the fire could light up the entire forest. So it was really a trial and error process of learning to control fire enough to harness its effects, but not let it get out of control so that it spreads and ruins everything. And that's really the same process that we're trying to do here with quantum computers. We want to maintain and preserve and utilize entanglement without letting it get out of hand.\n\n0:06:01.9\n\nSC: One of the key things you need to know about this field, about trying to use Majoranas to control entanglement and make a quantum computer, is that it's not just academics toiling away, there are a lot of power players from industry hunting for Majoranas.\n\n0:06:18.1\n\nZS: Corporations and governments have been understandably really interested in the prospect of building a quantum computer. The one thing we're pretty sure that a quantum computer could do is break modern cryptography. That has generated a lot of commercial and national interest in making these things work. And in the early 2000s, Microsoft, I guess, caught wind of this proposal to build a topological quantum computer, a quantum computer based on Majoranas. They essentially bought all in. They established a whole research arm that has been dedicated to making a topological quantum computer a reality. With that interest and funding has come a lot of other private interests and has sort of muddled the waters between academic and corporate goals.\n\n0:07:14.4\n\nSC: One of your sources said, you need thousands, millions of qubits, but when you put any few of them together, error goes up. Is that kind of the state of the business now?\n\n0:07:24.8\n\nZS: Yeah, that's the big hold up with the current iteration of quantum computers is that they're not what they call fault tolerant. What you want is a computer where the more qubits that you add, the more powerful it becomes, the more computations it can do, the faster. But right now we're at a point where the more qubits you add to an array, the worse your errors get. The way that traditional computers get around this problem is by redundancy. If you have three bits that are recording the same information and one of them flips, then you know that the answer was probably what the other two have. It works pretty well for normal computers. But for quantum computers, that becomes a lot more difficult and essentially impossible because of this weird rule of quantum mechanics where you can't exactly clone a quantum state, so you can't just build in redundant qubits.\n\n0:08:18.7\n\nSC: Yeah, and Majorana is going to help with that.\n\n0:08:21.3\n\nZS: In theory, if we could get the Majoranas to work as qubits, you shouldn't have this same problem. The errors shouldn't skyrocket in the same way because of the way that their information is encoded.\n\n0:08:31.7\n\nSC: What about the Majorana method is so compelling?\n\n0:08:35.6\n\nZS: As one of my sources, Sankar Das Sarma puts it, you can think of the effort to build a quantum computer like climbing Mount Everest. The traditional routes toward building qubits have made it really far. They've trekked hundreds of miles already, but they started in California. Whereas this Majorana approach has made zero steps, or very few steps [chuckle] toward climbing the mountain, but they started at base camp. And so if they are able to actually follow through and produce functional logical qubits and eventually build a computer out of them, they have fewer hurdles to overcome than the other route does because of the way that they're more protected from errors and shielding themselves from fire than the other groups are.\n\n[music]\n\n0:09:25.2\n\nZS: Months after proposing his particle, the 31-year-old Ettore Majorana withdrew a large sum from his bank account, took a boat across the Tyrrhenian Sea, and vanished. To this day, nobody's sure what happened to him, and the jury is also still out on whether his particle exists. Before Ettore Majorana vanished in 1938, he sent a series of cryptic messages to his family and colleagues about his impending sudden disappearance, leading many to suspect he'd taken his own life. But over the following years, purported sightings of Majorana multiplied, as a beggar enables a monk in Calabria and a vagabond in South America. The search for the ghost of his particle has been similarly confounded by imposters.\n\n0:10:10.9\n\nSC: We really haven't gotten into the specifics of why Majoranas might be so helpful. What's different about them than these other approaches that people have tried in the past or are still trying for using different things as qubits?\n\n0:10:23.5\n\nZS: There's another weird thing about quantum mechanics in which when you have electrons in a certain system, so we're talking about, for the most part, flat surfaces in a high magnetic field, you can get electrons to pair up with spaces where there aren't electrons, something called a hole, and they can form what's called a quasiparticle, where it looks as though the electron is in two different places at once. They call these anyons for their ability to do seemingly anything, and they're essentially like fractional charges of electrons. And there's a certain subset of these fractional charges that can do this really weird thing that could be really helpful for quantum computing. And they have this property where if you move multiple of them around each other, it changes their shared state. What it allows you to do is essentially tie knots in the histories of these particles.\n\n0:11:28.5\n\nZS: A good way to think about this is anyons as like balls on a table, and beneath them there are like strings hanging down underneath the table. And when you move these particles around each other, like do the old shell and cup game, the strings get knotted underneath the table. And you can use those knots as a way to encode different numbers and information.\n\n0:11:52.3\n\nSC: How are the anyons, these partially charged electron, hole, quasiparticle things, how are they related to Majoranas?\n\n0:12:01.4\n\nZS: The simplest one of these class of anyons that can do this weird braiding thing is in a sense related to Majorana fermions. And the reason is that the most basic way to construct something that can play this weird electron game is to create a quasiparticle that is... You can think of it as like it's 50% electron, 50% hole.\n\n0:12:26.6\n\nSC: Okay. So the braiding would like help with the operations that the quantum computer would be able to do?\n\n0:12:31.3\n\nZS: Yes. The braiding is the operations that the quantum computer is doing. So rather than encoding zeros and ones through the spin of an electron, for example, as some classes of qubits work, we're talking about encoding information in the way that these Majoranas are wrapped around each other in space.\n\n0:12:50.9\n\nSC: Okay, so I'm just going to point out here that that's why it's called topological computing because you're talking about the shape of something in space. But Zack, I have a question. Have researchers been able to braid these Majoranas?\n\n0:13:03.8\n\nZS: It depends a bit on who you ask. [laughter] I think the general consensus is, no. So this question has been the subject of great debate for like two decades now. Basically, the real controversy over this stems from the idea that we're not exactly sure what these things would look like and we're therefore not exactly sure what signals they would produce, or if those signals are unique to the thing that we're actually looking for. So that has been the lingering struggle.\n\n[music]\n\n0:13:35.6\n\nZS: In 2011, Rome's Public Prosecutor's Office reopened its investigation into a Ettore Majorana's disappearance. Detectives had come across an alleged photograph of Majorana from 1955 in Venezuela, where he had supposedly been living under the alias Mr. Bini. They attempted to match the man's facial structure to an old photo of Majorana and concluded that he had run away to South America, perhaps because he foresaw how his colleagues work on atomic energy could lead to nuclear weapons. Content with the explanation, the prosecutor's office officially closed the case in 2015, but many were left dissatisfied. Francesco Guerra, a physicist at the University of Rome who continues to investigate the case, says the conclusion was completely ridiculous.\n\n0:14:21.1\n\nSC: It's been decades and theorists have come up with benchmarks or hallmarks that would indicate to someone trying something in the lab that you found a Majorana. Then you'd publish on that and say, here, we've met these benchmarks, but it turns out something else could have also met that benchmark or those peaks are not unique to Majoranas. And so experimentalists go back to the bench, say we've met a new definition from theorists, so on and so forth. Things are retracted. People don't believe each other. The state of the field is basically no one will believe that you have Majoranas until you've built a quantum computer from them. But despite all these bumps, and it's been years, there's still hope out there.\n\n0:15:03.6\n\nZS: There are multiple avenues of research that people have been pursuing to get to this Majorana. Each of them thinks at least that they're at sort of a turning point and that they're close to having a breakthrough. The main technique that people have been using to get the Majorana, which is the strategy that Microsoft has really honed in on, is creating them at the ends of these really thin, small wires. A few months ago, Microsoft put out a paper that they believe is really strong evidence that they have Majorana's there, although people have their doubts, and the next step is for them to make a qubit out of it. And so they're sort of in their minds on the verge of showing that this thing has potential.\n\n0:15:45.4\n\nSC: But there's doubt.\n\n0:15:46.3\n\nZS: There's always doubt. [chuckle] So there's another approach that has emerged in the past few years. Basically, it's all thanks to these researchers who have figured out that graphene, which is basically the graphite that makes up your pencil lead. You can extract a single atom thick layer of that graphite, which is called graphene, and that you can turn that graphene into structures that seem to be really conducive for creating these quasiparticles. That has gotten a lot of people really excited because it's a totally new approach. It faces its own challenges, but they're at least new challenges, and they seem to be making rapid progress with this. Those researchers are pretty confident that they can get to a qubit without any major miracles happening in the next few years, which is exciting.\n\n0:16:38.9\n\nSC: One of the things that comes up a lot in your story is the fact that industry got involved, a lot of money got involved, and the field maybe wouldn't have gotten as far as it did without that involvement, but not everyone thinks that it's been good news or it's been all positive.\n\n0:16:54.4\n\nZS: Totally. Yeah. One of the researchers I talked to described this as a sort of double edged sword because there has certainly been an influx of funding to do this kind of research. People made the claim that Microsoft's involvement alone made this study of topological materials worthy of pursuing and like a household name in the field. That certainly had a positive effect on getting people excited about this and believing that there's potential in it. However, just the nature of having a corporation inside of a field that would otherwise be largely academic is that they have different interests here. They have different needs for protecting their information and some of the information that might otherwise be peer reviewed and open access has been kept behind closed doors. People also often note that it's not just the presence of Microsoft, first off, there are many other large and small corporate entities that are involved in this.\n\n0:17:55.4\n\nSC: Can't forget Google.\n\n0:17:56.6\n\nZS: Google is here as well. There's a huge number of startup companies, smaller tech companies that are also involved in this, so it's definitely not just a Microsoft thing. Also, people often point to other factors that are influencing the sort of rush to claim Majorana detections, including the pressure from high-impact journals such as Science.\n\n0:18:19.1\n\nSC: We've been hearing a lot about the hunt for the missing physicist, Ettore Majorana. One of the things that came up in your interviews, though, was that basically Charlie Marcus has this opposition to calling this a hunt for Majoranas. Why shouldn't we be calling this a hunt?\n\n0:18:34.3\n\nZS: Charlie's point here was that one of the big issues, like the overarching issue with this field is that people have been treating this as though it's a manhunt and that one day we'll just wake up and we're gonna find Ettore Majorana's corpse at the bottom of the ocean. We're gonna say, Majorana zero modes exist and they're right here and now I can make a computer with them. And his point was that that's not how experimental physics works. I think a lot of people agree that there's not just going to be one moment where the whole community agrees, we've done it, we've found Majorana. Rather, there will be this iterative process where through various experiments and replication through other labs, that the community will come to a consensus that this is beyond reasonable doubt existence of Majorana and then we will slowly go along the road of turning that quasiparticle into a computer.\n\n[music]\n\n0:19:35.4\n\nZS: Over the years, accounts of Ettore Majorana's disappearance have degraded into baseless conspiracies and fictional spinoffs, featuring alien abductions and time travel machines. But Guerra and Nadia Robotti, a historian of physics at the University of Genoa, think that the truth is out there. They have uncovered new documents from government, religious, and familial archives that seem to reference Majorana's death about a year after his disappearance. Guerra and Robotti still do not know where or how Majorana died, but they think his descendants are concealing documents that would shed more light. And three years ago, they flew to UC Berkeley to visit the archive of Emilio Segr\u00e8, the physicist whose friendship with Majorana soured in the years before his disappearance. The researchers came across a folder that per Segr\u00e8's instructions cannot be opened until the year 2057.\n\n0:20:27.8\n\nSC: Zack Savitsky is a freelance science writer.

Up next, a look at El Salvador's adoption of a cryptocurrency with researcher Diana Van Patten.\n\n[music]\n\n0:20:56.2\n\nSC: In 2021, El Salvador became the first country to make a cryptocurrency legal tender, Bitcoin in this case. Basically this means that government and all businesses in the country must accept Bitcoin as payment. There were several motivations for this, but a big one was that a large percentage of the people in El Salvador do not have bank accounts. So it's not easy to access electronic money. It's been a few years and Diana Van Patten and colleagues have published a study in science that took a look into how cryptocurrency has been taken up in the country and why people have adopted it or not. Hi, Diana, welcome to the Science Podcast.\n\n0:21:34.7\n\nDiana Van Patten: Hello, Sarah. Thank you very much for inviting me.\n\n0:21:37.3\n\nSC: Oh, sure. So up until this point, we really don't know how cryptocurrency could be incorporated or might be incorporated into an economy as a currency, as a medium of exchange. People might use it to buy things or pay debts or store money, but how this integration might happen is kind of the big question.\n\n0:21:57.5\n\nDP: Yes. And there are some hypothesis as to why it is that crypto has not been used as a medium of exchange. One of them is that there's something that we call the coordination failure, meaning that you don't use it because you don't believe that other people are gonna accept it. Another one is that there are relatively large fees in order to conduct transactions in crypto. And so the feeling is that, oh, if this fees were lower, maybe it would be used as a medium of exchange.\n\n0:22:29.5\n\nSC: So there you're saying there's some hypotheses about why it's not accepted?\n\n0:22:32.9\n\nDP: Yes.\n\n0:22:33.4\n\nSC: And one is that people don't think everybody else has it. People think that it's too costly.\n\n0:22:38.8\n\nDP: Yes. And finally, people claim that another reason why crypto is not being widely accepted is that governments do not accept it to pay for taxes.\n\n0:22:47.7\n\nSC: El Salvador or the government of El Salvador is trying to do away with some of these barriers to entry, which may encourage the citizens to adopt cryptocurrency. This could also help researchers understand which of these elements is important as a barrier.\n\n0:23:05.6\n\nDP: So you described that now Bitcoin is legal tenders. So in some sense, the government is solving this coordination issue because it is saying by law now everyone has to accept it for transactions. Moreover, the government is accepting it to pay for taxes. And then finally, the government was subsidizing all the transaction fees associated with paying in crypto. And so like if there was a chance for Bitcoin to be used as a medium of exchange, this kind of set up a nice opportunity for that to happen.\n\n0:23:38.4\n\nSC: We're talking about cryptocurrency, which I guess people have a general sense what that is, but could we just do a really quick what? Is cryptocurrency primer here?\n\n0:23:48.4\n\nDP: A cryptocurrency is gonna be a digital currency. What defines a digital currency as crypto in particular, is that transactions are verified and recorded in a decentralized system as opposed to centralized authority.\n\n0:24:03.9\n\nSC: So I spend money all the time like with my card through my bank, and there's a place there that records our transactions, but that's different than crypto. What's the difference?\n\n0:24:14.3\n\nDP: All transactions that you do are being recorded by your bank, but in the background, you're using dollars.\n\n0:24:20.2\n\nSC: Okay. So what are some of the reasons that El Salvador decided that it would be a good idea to incorporate cryptocurrency as a legal tender?\n\n0:24:28.0\n\nDP: When the policy was announced, the official stance of the government was that it would generate jobs, provide financial inclusion, and facilitate sending remittances. This last part is important in the context of El Salvador. El Salvador is a dollarized country where remittances are a very large percentage of GDP.\n\n0:24:49.7\n\nSC: What's a remittance?\n\n0:24:50.9\n\nDP: Suppose someone migrates from El Salvador to the United States, this is the most popular destination for Salvadorian migrants. They send money back to their families in El Salvador, and that money is called remittances. Usually you would have to use a service that is gonna charge a fee, and so sending it in Bitcoin could potentially avoid some of the fees or delays associated with sending remittances, particularly if the government is subsidizing the fees.\n\n0:25:19.4\n\nSC: What do they do to make this easy for people to encourage the use of Bitcoin to launch it out into the country?\n\n0:25:27.4\n\nDP: The government also launched an app called Chivo Wallet. Chivo means cool in El Salvador. This was a way to facilitate take-up. People will be able to conduct transactions both in Bitcoin and in dollars with subsidized fees if they downloaded the app. They also gave a big incentive for people to download this particular app. Anyone who downloaded the app would get a $30 bonus in Bitcoin just because they downloaded it, which doesn't sound like a lot, but because El Salvador has a GDP that is much lower than the United States, GDP per capita is about $40,000 a year. $30 represents almost four daily minimum wages. So a big incentive in order to download the app.\n\n0:26:14.8\n\nSC: Okay. So they have these incentives in place and everybody's supposed to be able to take this as payment and you're supposed to be able to pay your debts with it or taxes and get remittances. How did it do? What was usage like? Were people buying things with cryptocurrency or paying their taxes?\n\n0:26:34.3\n\nDP: Yeah, so that was the big question. We found a challenge, which was that the government revealed only selected information, most of it through the president's Twitter account. And so for example, the president would claim that more than 2 million Salvadorians were actively using the app and that it was a big success. However, there was no kind of more systematic, reliable data in order to assess if that was actually true. And so our solution was to conduct our own survey, collect the data ourselves. And we conducted a nationally representative face-to-face survey. We also collected information on transactions of Chivo from the blockchain. The blockchain is a public ledger that records transactions in Bitcoin.\n\n0:27:26.4\n\nSC: Was the Bitcoin ledger able to tell you about every single transaction that happened with the app?\n\n0:27:31.9\n\nDP: No. So this app that I described, the Chivo Wallet, which was launched by the government, is a non-custodial wallet, which means that you do not have the key to your Bitcoin. So the government kind of does these transactions in Bitcoin within the app, but this is not something that is being really recorded in the public ledger. And so the transactions that are going to be recorded in the public ledger have to do with, for example, a person that has a different wallet and that is sending you Bitcoin into your Chivo Wallet. So if tourists go to El Salvador or if there are remittances going on from people that have different wallets in the US to their relatives in El Salvador that have Chivo Wallet, that would be recorded.\n\n0:28:15.8\n\nSC: Okay. But does it give you some insight into how often people are using it for those purposes at least?\n\n0:28:22.0\n\nDP: Yes. And it will also allow us to further validate the survey. Also Chivo Wallet as a whole conducts transactions in order to exchange Bitcoin for dollars, for example. So we can see roughly what is the volume of transactions in Chivo as a whole.\n\n0:28:39.9\n\nSC: What did you find was the uptake of Bitcoin by people in El Salvador? Were they likely to use it? Did many people do it? Or was it a little bit of a dud?\n\n0:28:51.9\n\nDP: So according to statements by the president, like almost everyone was already using Chivo. So like starter was to say, okay, do you know that Chivo exists? And actually only about 68% of people in El Salvador knew about Chivo at all. These are also not random people, the ones that knew about Chivo. So the characteristics of these people are people that already have a cellphone with internet, but also people who are already bankerized, so people who already have a bank account, people who are relatively educated, people who are relatively young. And so if you're thinking of the motivations that the government had at the beginning of increasing financial inclusion, it seems like the people that you really like to reach were the ones that didn't even know about the app.\n\n0:29:41.7\n\nSC: Yeah. Of the people who did know about the app, how many of them or what percentage of them ended up using it to do something?\n\n0:29:49.4\n\nDP: Out of the people who knew about the app, about 48% tried to download the app. So about half of those people tried to download the app. Again, when we see who are these people, they are not random people, they're the ones that are like more likely to have a bank account, more likely to have more education, cellphone with internet. Men, in general, men had more take-up than women. We start like getting a population that's every time more selected.\n\n0:30:18.3\n\nSC: So did people actually use it to pay their taxes?\n\n0:30:21.7\n\nDP: No. So when we look at taxes and remittances, which again, were kind of in the part of the discourse of why this was gonna be successful, the share of people that are using Chivo Wallet to pay for taxes, that are using Chivo Wallet to receive remittances is extremely small. So about 5% of people are paying their taxes with Chivo and only 3% of people are receiving remittances in Bitcoin. About 8% of people are receiving remittances in dollars. Remember, Chivo Wallet can be used for transactions in Bitcoin and in dollars. Always, usage is much lower in Bitcoin than in dollars. Even though overall it's low, it's gonna be even lower if we're thinking about Bitcoin in particular.\n\n0:31:02.5\n\nSC: So what are some of the motivations that you heard about when you asked people about Bitcoin and this app?\n\n0:31:08.4\n\nDP: Well, the main reason to download the app, not surprisingly, was the very large bonus that you could get just because of downloading it. Most people stopped using the app after spending the $30 bonus. The ones that continued using the app were the ones that were more likely to have been using cryptocurrency even before this program was launched. And so again, if we're thinking of financial inclusion and changing people's behavior towards this new method of payment, the program did not seem that successful. Why is it that people did not download Chivo or use Bitcoin? Overwhelmingly, the answers point to lack of trust, concerns with privacy, and a lack of understanding. So a lot of people didn't really know what Bitcoin was, for example, and therefore they did not use it.\n\n0:32:00.4\n\nSC: In my mind, cryptocurrency is associated with privacy. Were people not understanding that or is this less private because it's through the government and it's an app run by the government?\n\n0:32:12.9\n\nDP: In order to download the app and get the $30 bonus, you needed to input your ID into the app. The privacy that people usually associate with cryptocurrencies was not present in this setting. Lack of privacy can really deter people from using a technology.\n\n0:32:30.1\n\nSC: Yeah.\n\n0:32:30.5\n\nDP: This is very related to another question we ask where people say, I just prefer cash. Cash is anonymous and so that's something that at least in the context of us how other people really, really value.\n\n0:32:42.4\n\nSC: Now the fact that the government is holding the Bitcoin, how does that relate to what we think of, oh Bitcoin is up, Bitcoin is down, people are holding it to invest and to wait to trade it off. Is all of that volatility now in the hands of the government and the people that are using the wallets don't have to worry about it?\n\n0:33:01.5\n\nDP: So the government is actually not holding a lot in Bitcoin at least according to the data we have from the blockchain. In that sense, the government doesn't seem to be extremely exposed to what is happening to the prices in Bitcoin. If you look at the market as a whole, at the whole blockchain, whenever the price of Bitcoin goes up, the volume transacted is gonna go up and vice versa, if the price goes down, the volume goes down. So there's this response and this interaction between volume and price.\n\n0:33:31.5\n\nDP: This is how you would expect a market like this one to work. However, in Chivo, if you look only at Chivo, there's a no relationship whatsoever between changes in volume and changes in prices. This indicates that activity in Chivo Wallet is mostly driven by idiosyncratic features of El Salvador like how much is being deposited at a particular moment in time because of the needs of the country at that moment, but it's not driven by Bitcoin prices. So we don't see evidence of the government kind of speculating or exposing itself in terms of the Bitcoin price.\n\n0:34:05.2\n\nSC: Okay. The effect of the Bitcoin market doesn't seem to have a role to play here in this app. So going back to the main result here, which is this was not very well taken up. Since 2021 when this was adopted in El Salvador, a couple other countries have decided to start accepting cryptocurrency as legal tender. Are we seeing the same trends in those places?\n\n0:34:27.3\n\nDP: So at least through the lens of our results, we have some extrapolations that we can do. And so for example in the Central African Republic that was the second country to make Bitcoin legal tender, to best of our knowledge, there's not a study that is similar to ours to know exactly what happened there, but we would expect that because the Central African Republic is more bankerized than El Salvador, we would see a higher share of adopters than we saw in El Salvador.\n\n0:34:56.3\n\nDP: Now, it's also good to mention that the Central African Republic is similar to El Salvador in that the alternative to crypto is also a very stable currency, it is the franc. And so if we had a country like the Central African Republic but that had a currency that was unstable, let's call that country Argentina because one of the co-authors of this paper is Argentinian, in that case, there would be a potentially an even larger incentive to adopt because you're not comparing Bitcoin to a super stable currency, you're comparing Bitcoin to an unstable currency as well.\n\n0:35:30.4\n\nSC: What's your main takeaway from the study now that you've kind of looked across all these different questions you had about using Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador?\n\n0:35:39.8\n\nDP: So the government provided this so-called big push in order to incentivize Bitcoin, providing conditions that were much better than you would find in an environment that had no intervention. Regardless, Bitcoin usage remains quite low. Kind of to tie this up with how we started, Bitcoin is not being used as a medium of exchange. So we see it being transacted a little bit, but mostly by a very selected group of people, and so it was not successful in promoting financial inclusions. Regardless, there are lessons to be learned for Salvador, but also for other countries that might want to make Bitcoin legal tender and for countries that are attempting to implement central bank digital currencies. So we document that trust and privacy play a key role. We documented the cost of adoption seems to be quite large, not even a very large subsidy convinced a larger of people to adopt and these are lessons that could apply to other settings.\n\n0:36:40.6\n\nSC: Great.

        "content": "TP Icap's Duncan Trenholme spoke to DL News about how his clients are seeking out Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives.\n\nHe also spoke about trends in the industry, including soaring Bitcoin prices and the Binance settlement fallout.\n\nHe plans more hires for the digital assets unit amid more institutional interest in the sector.\n\nTP Icap\u2019s Duncan Trenholme got animated when speaking about a recent milestone in crypto \u2014 that he says went under the radar.\n\nEarlier this year, CME Group leapfrogged crypto-native exchange Binance to become the largest exchange for Bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nIt happened even before US regulators slapped a $4.3 billion fine on Binance in November.\n\n\u201dThat was huge. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s talked about enough in general,\u201d said Trenholme, global co-head of digital assets at the world\u2019s largest inter-broker dealer.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n\u201cIt points to more traditional financial firms, more institutional firms, wholesale firms, coming into crypto.\u201d\n\nThis move could be the beginning of a trend Trenholme expects to develop in 2024 \u2014 as the hard border between traditional finance and crypto begins to blur.\n\nTP Icap, which matches buyers and sellers who trade more $1 trillion a day in a range of asset classes, has seen this first-hand.\n\nThere\u2019s been a steady flow of customers from across the firm\u2019s business that are eager to onboard and trade digital assets \u2014 including customers from fixed income and equities, global markets worth a combined $200 trillion.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nRecord monthly volume\n\nAnd the FTX scandal has helped lure traders from crypto-native firms, helping drive monthly volume at TP Icap to a record in October, Trenholme said in an interview at TP Icap\u2019s offices in London\u2019s Victoria area.\n\nOne big reason: \u201cPrice action that has been caused around Bitcoin, Bitcoin\u2019s run recently and I\u2019m sure, some of that is down to anticipation of the spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\u201d\n\nWhile trading slowed down in November, Trenholme says the firm has seen a boost in trading activity in wholesale regulated crypto asset derivatives for the last year and half.\n\n\u201cDecember has been more active than November for us on the derivatives side,\u201d said Trenholme, who started off in equity derivatives at the firm and moved to crypto in 2018.\n\nAnd in 2024, he sees more client interest coming for the crypto world as prices soar.\n\n\u201cWe expect more focus on over the counter derivatives, non-deliverable forwards, over-the-counter options\u201d he said.\n\nTwo big developments\n\nBitcoin\u2019s more than 150% surge this year has piqued curiosity from investors old and new.\n\nBut two big events in 2023 have been clutch.\n\nThis year saw the New York trade association dubbed ISDA, or the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, incorporate key terminology for digital assets.\n\nAnother big step, Trenholme noted, was the introduction of the first International Securities Identification Numbers for digital assets. ISIN numbers are prerequisites for clearing, reporting, and settlement of trades.\n\nBitcoin miners and Ethereum stakers\n\nThat has helped bring crypto into the fold of traditional trading structures, and has helped drive client demand, he said.\n\nHe sees increased interest in so-called hash-rate derivatives, financial instruments that offer volatility hedging for Bitcoin miners, as well as staking rate derivatives, that help with the interest clients earn when they stake Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more questions asked about those types of products,\u201d Trenholme said. \u201cWe expect there to be a continued trend of our traditional customers either coming back to the market or getting into the market for the first time. If the market continues to be more of a bullish nature, then that\u2019s only going to increase.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a trend that has been slowly but steadily gaining traction for about 18 months, he said, since the collapse of FTX and the US conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nThe FTX effect\n\nSince FTX, there has been a change in institutional investors\u2019 attitudes \u2014 a \u201cgeneral shift in volume moving off unregulated offshore platforms onto regulated entities in major financial jurisdictions,\u201d Trenholme said.\n\nAmong those also poised to cash in from this trend: Larry Fink, the boss of $9 trillion fund giant BlackRock, whose Bitcoin ETF is awaiting regulatory approval amid what he called a \u201cflight to quality\u201d in these trying times for crypto.\n\nHis line was echoed by CME Group\u2019s Giovanni Vicioso, who told DL News in November that the 125-year old Chicago derivatives exchange was able to jump above Binance thanks to punters seeking out regulated \u2014 and thus safer \u2014 alternatives.\n\nSuch a flight to safety following scandals, fines, and convictions in the industry this year has been a double edged sword.\n\nOn one hand, the potential for a spot Bitcoin ETF from traditional fund giants including BlackRock and Fidelity has helped lift crypto prices, underpinning a new bull market.\n\nOn the other, crypto native firms may start to feel the pinch from an onslaught of regulated, compliance-savvy rivals.\n\nDid clients flee Binance after that bombshell settlement?\n\nIt\u2019s tricky to say, particularly because the flow data mostly comes from Binance, a private company that is not subject to public disclosure rules.\n\nThe industry, Trenholme says, has looked at the issue optimistically \u2014 as a hurdle that has been surmounted, and now everyone can move on.\n\nAnd CME inflows are a signal that next year will see more evolution, that will include more mainstream financial peers.\n\nMeanwhile, Trenholme says he sees a change in approach from big banks, which are thinking more \u201cexternally about the wider market,\u201d beyond secondary markets and financial market participants.\n\nHiring and expansion\n\nTrenholme and fellow global co-head of digital assets Simon Forster have been busy building their team, pulling talent with strong finance backgrounds.\n\nDigital assets product director Nithya Sridharan joined in September after almost a decade at Credit Suisse. And Hina Sattar, a former trader at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, joined in October as sales director of digital assets.\n\nHe said he\u2019s hiring \u201ca couple more\u201d for TP Icap\u2019s Fusion Digital Assets spot crypto-asset exchange.\n\nTrenholme said he\u2019s seen some leave crypto and go back to traditional markets, which is a good thing, \u201cbecause it brings people who are advocates for crypto back into financial services.\u201d\n\nWintermute explained a similar dynamic in October.\n\n\u201cOur team is growing,\u201d Trenholme said. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing a very organic pace, in line with our products maturing.\u201d\n\nDo you have a tip?

        "title": "Ethereum loses its shine as Bitcoin dominates, Solana climbs - Fortune",
        "content": "The rising crypto tide of 2023 has lifted all boats, but some of those vessels are floating higher than others. Bitcoin, riding a wave of ETF optimism, is worth far more than all of the other digital assets combined and is up a handsome 132% on the year. Ethereum rival Solana appears to have shaken off its Sam Bankman-Fried association once and for all and this week eclipsed XRP to become the fifth-biggest token in the market while climbing over 400% in 2023. And Ethereum? It\u2019s up a relatively modest 66%.\n\nPrice movements are hardly the only way to judge a currency of course. Meme coins like Doge or BONK or whatever regularly pop up by crazy amounts on the heels of social media hype but still lack any logical value proposition. Still, price reflects sentiment\u2014vibes if you prefer\u2014and right now the vibe around Ethereum feels decidedly stale.\n\nAs we embark on what looks like a new crypto bull market, Ethereum is facing familiar problems of absurdly high gas fees that make simple transactions unviable. Meanwhile, its vaunted layer-2 solutions do make the blockchain affordable but also introduce an unwelcome layer of complexity for casual crypto users. It\u2019s the same old story and there are no signs it\u2019s going to change anytime soon.\n\nMessari founder and crypto wiseman Ryan Selkis makes this case in his annual industry prognosis, writing that Ethereum is losing some of its luster:\n\n\u201cETH is straddled. BTC outperforms ETH as digital money thanks to institutional allocators\u2019 interest in the digital gold \u2018pure play\u2019 while broad availability of Ethereum substitutes (L0s, L1s, L2s) will likely lead to those substitutes\u2019 outperformance as they sop up onchain volumes relative to the Ethereum main chain. I don\u2019t see a scenario where ETH outperforms bitcoin AND its up-and-coming, higher-beta peers.\u201d\n\nSelkis, however, also points out that Ethereum losing a step was likely inevitable as competition increased in the smart contract industry that it pioneered:\n\n\u201cIf anything, being bearish on ETH relative to the field is not an indictment of Ethereum, but rather a clear-eyed realization that ETH as an asset has been incredibly dominant so far, and has set the bar impossibly high to maintain over a 60% market share in its network token peer group. When I think of Ethereum vs. Solana, I think of Visa vs. Mastercard, not Google vs. Bing in terms of relative strength.\u201d\n\nThat sounds about right. Ethereum has many strengths, including its inclusive developer ecosystem and the pedigree of integrity that its creator Vitalik Buterin bequeathed, but there was no way it was going to remain the only game in town. And for now, its role as the second-most-important blockchain remains unchallenged but, if the blockchain doesn\u2019t increase its vibe game in 2024, that could change.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCrypto scammers are using a flaw in Twitter to create tweets containing URLs that look like they come from Binance, Ethereum, and other real sites.

        "content": "The launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States could cause a shortage of \u201cregulated\u201d Bitcoin (BTC) and hurt one popular trading strategy, according to Coinbase researchers.\n\nThere are less than three weeks left until a potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, with many believing trading could begin not long after. However, Coinbase\u2019s head of institutional research, David Duong, and senior sales trader, Greg Sutton, said two key risks could appear once they begin trading.\n\nIn a Dec. 19 podcast, Duong and Sutton said the launch could cause an issue for institutions sourcing BTC, referring to issuers needing to buy enough Bitcoin to hold in their ETFs.\n\n\u201cYou need to buy Bitcoin from certain regulated places, what if demand is so great that these guys are unable to acquire the Bitcoin they need?\u201d\n\nCrypto venture firm Bitwise predicted that a spot Bitcoin ETF would be the most successful launch of an ETF product of all time.\n\nWhile he admitted that this is a good problem to have when compared to low inflows, Duong said the sourcing risk was one worth keeping in mind moving forward.\n\nSutton said a second risk concerns one of the more popular institutional trading strategies, known as the \u201cbasis trade\u201d \u2014 which refers to taking advantage of the difference between the spot price of Bitcoin and the price of BTC futures contracts.\n\nDue to the massive uptick in volume on both spot Bitcoin and futures contracts, the potential profit on the basis trade has surged as high as 20% in the last fortnight, according to data from Velo.\n\nHowever, as institutional investors gain increasingly direct exposure to Bitcoin \u2014 by way of a spot ETF product \u2014 the basis will narrow, causing there to be far less profitability in the trade.\n\nRelated: Spot Bitcoin ETF \u2018nailed on\u2019 for 2024: K33 report\n\nThere are currently 13 applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF pending with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There is a wide consensus that one or all of these products could be approved by as early as Jan. 10, with Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart pinning the chance of an approval at 90%.\n\nAccording to a Dec. 21 X post from Seyffart, crypto asset manager Grayscale met with the SEC once more, in a bid to to push for in-kind redemptions instead of cash creation.\n\nAn in-kind redemption model is typically seen as more efficient for ETF issuers, as it avoids bid/ask spreads and broker commissions that come from selling the asset to raise cash for issuing shares.\n\nMagazine: DeFi\u2019s billion-dollar secret: The insiders responsible for hacks"

        "content": "December 22, 2023 02:39 pm | Updated 02:39 pm IST\n\nThere is far more to the world of crypto than just that day\u2019s price of Bitcoin. 2023 marked momentous shifts in the blockchain playing field as U.S. regulators brought tech billionaires to task while India became a major crypto adopter, setting the stage for what could be a 2024 filled with legal drama and strife.\n\nHere are just five compelling sagas which unfolded in the blockchain sector this year:\n\nThe FTX saga comes to a close (almost)\n\nThe FTX cryptocurrency exchange run by the eccentric, wild-haired billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, known for his luxurious lifestyle and multi-million dollar political donations, collapsed in November 2022. Almost a year later, the ex-CEO was convicted on seven criminal charges related to fraud and money laundering, as it was learned that FTX customer funds were misused to support a sister company called Alameda Research.\n\nDuring the legal proceedings that stretched through this year, Bankman-Fried\u2019s former colleagues, including a past romantic partner, testified that he knowingly broke laws and issued orders that hurt his customers. Bankman-Fried\u2019s court appearances during the trial were chaotic, he was jailed for witness tampering, and he presented himself as a businessman let down by his officials rather than as a malicious crypto criminal.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\nHis sentencing is set for March 2024 and could lead to him spending decades in jail. Meanwhile, FTX debtors and liquidators in December agreed on a global settlement to help customers get back some of their assets.\n\nBinance\u2019s billionaire CEO steps down\n\nThe Chinese-born Canadian crypto tycoon and billionaire Changpeng Zhao was known as the head of Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Binance has in the past halted operations in several countries due to regulatory crackdowns, but this year saw the exchange agreeing to pay a massive settlement of roughly $4 billion to the U.S. government in late November for its illegal activities. In addition to this, Zhao pleaded guilty to a felony related to his failure to prevent money laundering on Binance, and stepped down as CEO.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Binance enabled more than 100,000 transactions violating U.S. sanctions, including ones linked to Hamas\u2019 al-Qassam Brigades, al-Qaeda, and even sexual abusers. The crypto exchange will be monitored as it is forced to formally exit the U.S. market.\n\nZhao\u2019s vocal influence in the sector is undeniable; his critical tweets about FTX\u2019s business practices in 2022 are credited with sparking the mass panic in which users all tried to pull out their funds from FTX, accelerating the exchange\u2019s collapse. Zhao\u2019s sentencing is due to take place in the U.S. next February.\n\nWorldcoin\u2019s formal launch\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman was a controversial figure in the crypto community long before he became a major player in generative AI this year. His blockchain project, Worldcoin, aims to create a biometric database of the human population in exchange for giving them access to crypto and a digital ID which has been compared to India\u2019s Aadhaar number. The initiative was severely criticised by privacy advocates, including Edward Snowden, during its trial run in 2021. Altman this May raised $115 million for the project, whose crypto tokens are not available to U.S.-based users.\n\nAs OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT sparked off an AI boom and Altman flew around the world to discuss AI regulation with state leaders and top technologists, he formally launched Worldcoin. \u201cOperators\u201d across the world began collecting millions of iris scans by giving people the Worldcoin cryptocurrency in return. Worldcoin has also penetrated India, with \u201corb operators\u201d in cities such as Delhi and Bangalore encouraging people to get scanned. Activists in countries such as Indonesia have accused Worldcoin volunteers of coercing impoverished people to hand over their biometric data, without getting their informed consent.\n\nWorldcoin token prices fluctuated wildly in November this year as Altman was fired as the CEO of OpenAI, before getting hired by Microsoft and then being reinstated at OpenAI.\n\nIndia tops in grassroots adoption\n\n2023 was another year in which India\u2019s grassroots adoption of crypto raced far ahead of the legislation meant to regulate it, as blockchain analytics platform Chainalysis ranked the country first in its 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index released in October. Furthermore, India ranked second in terms of raw estimated crypto value received between July 2022 and June 2023, recording around $250 billion in crypto value in the past year. For comparison, the U.S. recorded roughly $1 trillion in crypto value during the same period.\n\nHowever, as grassroots crypto adoption grows, so does the number of scammers targeting victims who may not be familiar with blockchain technology. In the latter half of 2023, Indian authorities investigated the Solar Techno Alliance (STA) Ponzi scheme. The STA crypto scam may be one of India\u2019s largest so far, as it involved an amount of around \u20b91,000 crore and 2 lakh people, per the Odisha police.\n\nRise of Bitcoin\n\nFrom prices as low as below $17,000, Bitcoin [BTC] has made a slow but significant recovery as it moves towards the $45,000 mark, which it has not yet successfully touched this year. Geopolitical shocks such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 shook the sector badly, but 2023 has seen price consolidation and relative stability in what is a naturally volatile market. Bitcoin\u2019s rise has a similar effect on other top crypto coins and tokens, so several popular assets are on an upward trajectory. Out of the maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin, more than 19 million BTC were in circulation as of late December.\n\nBitcoin is up by 161.26% in the past year, according to CoinMarketCap statistics, but crypto\u2019s largest coin by market capitalisation is far from its 2021 highs when it crossed $65,000 in price. Ethereum\u2019s Ether [ETH], the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, is up by 83.54% in the past year."

Credit: Photon photo via Shutterstock.\n\nAn exchange-traded fund or ETF is a type of investment that tracks a particular index, sector, or commodity that can be traded on a stock exchange like a regular stock.\n\nA bitcoin ETF would make it easier for both individuals and institutions to gain exposure to bitcoin, as well as signalling mainstream acceptance of the digital asset.\n\nFor the time being, investors buy their bitcoins from disreputable cryptocurrency exchanges and risk losing them if they leave their coins on the exchange, as was the case for customers of FTX, Mt. Gox, and many other failed cryptocurrency custodians.\n\nImage Source: GlobalData\n\nThe chart above shows the subsequent price rise of gold following the listing of the first gold ETF in March 2003. When gold ETFs were introduced, they provided an accessible and cost-effective way to invest in gold compared to buying physical gold.\n\nETF rejection\n\nThe first spot bitcoin ETF was submitted (and rejected) over a decade ago by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss when bitcoin was trading at $90. Today, bitcoin trades above $40,000, and over a dozen asset managers await SEC approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, including the world\u2019s largest asset manager Blackrock.\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

When Bitcoin\u2019s 840,000th block is mined (expected on April 17, 2024) the block reward will be cut in half to exactly 3.125 bitcoins in a preordained event known as the halving.\n\nImage Source: GlobalData\n\nBitcoin halving occur every 210,000 blocks or roughly four years, and in the past, this supply shock has been followed by an impressive bull run.\n\nScarcity can be difficult to quantify, but one way of doing this is by using a stock-to-flow ratio. At block height 839,999 (just before the next halving) the stock of bitcoin will be 19,687,500\u2013the total number of mined bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s flow is the number of bitcoins mined per year, after the halving this works out to 164,250 bitcoins per year, resulting in a stock-to-flow ratio just shy of 120 years. Meaning, at the post 2024 halving it would take 120 years to mine all the bitcoins in existence. Gold on the other hand is not so programmatic or auditable, but using data from the World Gold Council we can see that its stock-to-flow ratio can be estimated at 60 years.\n\nGreater demand for risk assets\n\nCentral banks around the world have been raising interest rates and keeping them high since Q1 of 2022 to fight inflation. Generally, in high-interest environments, low-risk fixed-income investments, such as government bonds, are favored over risky investments like bitcoin. When interest rates are cut you can expect greater demand for risky assets, including bitcoin.\n\nThe house view at GlobalData\u2019s TS Lombard is that the Federal Reserve will cut rates at the first sight of the economy wobbling. The broader view of the market can be gauged by looking at Fed Funds futures, these are tradeable contracts that enable investors to speculate or hedge against the target federal funds rate. FedWatch by CME Group is a handy tool that gives probabilities of rate cuts, as implied by the futures price data.\n\nImage Source: GlobalData\n\nThe chart above shows these probabilities over the next three FOMC meetings. We find that investors are expecting the Fed to keep rates high but are expecting a rate cut as early as March 2024, giving a March rate cut a probability of almost 80%. Investors give a 1.6% probability that there will not be a rate cut by May 2024.\n\nETF: Final thoughts\n\nWith bitcoin up over 160% year to date, you could argue that a lot of what I\u2019ve talked about is already priced in. The anticipated approval of a Bitcoin ETF, the impending halving event, and the possibility of rate cuts by central banks have likely contributed to the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price, but I believe there\u2019s still a lot of upside left for bitcoin."
