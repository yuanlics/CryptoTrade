        "title": "Proof of problems: Bitcoin mining's pollution toll on U.S. communities - Environmental Working Group",
        "content": "Once-dead coal-fired power plants roaring back to life and spewing hazardous emissions, overheating trout chopped up by utility water pipes, nonstop low-frequency noise \u2013 these are just some of the ways bitcoin mining is polluting communities across the U.S.\n\nIn six case studies, EWG profiles how a cryptocurrency mining process known as \u201cproof of work\u201d can create air, climate, water, waste, and noise pollution for those living nearby. The report spotlights the experiences of locals in six states and how the arrival of cryptocurrency mining has changed their lives and environments for the worse.\n\nNot all bitcoin mines are alike. Some rely on the resurrection of dormant fossil fuel power plants, some find low-cost high-pollution fuel sources like burning coal waste in Pennsylvania, and others flare gas from oil wells to generate the necessary electricity, like the mines blighting Montana\u2019s scenery.\n\nThey all use the same technology, individual computer hardware no bigger than a shoe box or two, all competing to solve the same puzzle and earn a few bitcoin. But it takes thousands of these mining computers, called rigs, to become competitive in the mining industry. That\u2019s why some companies are placing multiple shipping crates full of bitcoin mining rigs in communities across the U.S. \u2013 in one of the stories this report covers, an industrial-scale bitcoin mine sits just a few hundred feet from a home.\n\nWhat these mines have in common is their use of proof of work, which is wasteful by design. This system, a type of software to record and manage bitcoin transactions, has proven highly inefficient, requiring massive amounts of fossil fuel-generated electricity to operate. Proof of work is a source of constant noise, a blight in communities across the country, and a hotbed of fraud and corruption that bilks consumers and ratepayers out of billions of dollars.\n\nChange is needed, and it\u2019s needed urgently.\n\nDespite staunch opposition nearly everywhere bitcoin is mined, Wall Street bankers and other large financial backers manage to continue this assault on climate and communities across the country.\n\nCurrently, the most efficient bitcoin mining computers release more than 105 metric tons of carbon dioxide per bitcoin mined, but average emissions per bitcoin are easily double that. To fight the climate crisis, we need to cut emissions \u2013 not increase them.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. The bitcoin community is full of innovators who have changed its code before. Other processes also exist that use much less electricity and have none of the pollution implications outlined in these six case studies.\n\nImage\n\nWhile communities suffer, Wall Street cashes in\n\nIn the wake of a tidal wave of cryptocurrency bankruptcies that have seen average consumers\u2019 bitcoin and other crypto deposits completely wiped out, big Wall Street players have used this moment as a chance to invest in a largely unregulated industry that actively contributes to the climate crisis and harm of communities across the country. Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Fidelity all have climate commitments, but they invest in and offer crypto trading and management services that cause average Americans more harm than good.\n\nDespite its anti-establishment decentralized-finance roots, bitcoin is now the darling of big banks, multi-billion-dollar hedge funds, and private equity interests. The days of individual entrepreneurs and local businesses carving a niche out of the bitcoin business have long passed.\n\nAs its cycle of endless growth, energy consumption, and increasing emissions continues, the only question remaining is how much will bitcoin cost us all in rising electricity prices and emissions?\n\nMuch to the distress of their neighbors, bitcoin mining operations, in search of low-cost electricity, cheap land, and limited local planning or zoning regulations, are taking root in small rural communities located in pristine natural environments across the country.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s insatiable need for ever-more energy has led the industry to revive shuttered coal-fired power plants, siphon off energy resources from more economically productive uses, and even burn piles of waste coal too dirty for coal companies to sell.\n\nIn other places, the incessant din created by mining operations continues 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and is driving nearby residents to desperation. Many local governments have found themselves unable to effectively address the noise, leaving residents in these places to fend for themselves against the well-funded crypto mining menace.\n\nDespite staunch opposition nearly everywhere bitcoin is mined, Wall Street bankers and other large financial backers manage to continue this assault on climate and communities across the country.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy published a report last fall that calls on federal agencies to take more steps to assess the potential environmental and energy problems associated with proof of work digital assets. It also recommended Congress consider legislation.\n\nThe report even went so far as to suggest the federal government should limit or eliminate the use of highly energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining methods, such as proof of work, should the measures outlined in the report fail to reduce climate impacts.\n\nInitiatives are needed \u2013 whether regulatory, legislative, or voluntary \u2013 to identify less harmful approaches that would retain the potential benefits of blockchain technology, like proof of stake or some as-yet-undiscovered method that would make bitcoin both efficient and environmentally friendly."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is \u201cuntouchable\u201d despite ongoing regulatory pressures in the crypto sector, and those who don\u2019t have some crypto exposure are \u201cseriously silly\u201d according to Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone.\n\nDuring an April 3 stream with crypto podcaster Scott Melker, McGlone argued that unlike other cryptocurrencies such as Ether (ETH), Bitcoin couldn\u2019t be killed by regulators because it\u2019s more decentralized.\n\nCan #Bitcoin replace the banks? And can it remain uncorrelated if markets crash again?\n\n\n\nDiscussing with weekly guests @mikemcglone11 and @daveweisberger1.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s Macro Monday at 9:30 am EST. https://t.co/WDVCbkkWyU \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) April 3, 2023\n\n\"There\u2019s so much disdain about regulators pushing back on the whole space, and that\u2019s the key thing where Bitcoin sticks out,\u201d McGlone said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do anything to this, and you can\u2019t kill it and it\u2019s just unprecedented; it is untouchable.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could make a case that Ethereum is a security when you hear about all these upgrades and people doing this and people doing that to make it better, I\u2019m like okay, well that\u2019s kind of scary, can\u2019t do that to Bitcoin, it\u2019s why it\u2019s fine and impressive,\u201d McGlone added.\n\nThe crypto sector has faced a wave of crackdowns in the United States recently, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing charges against crypto exchange Kraken for its staking services, then suing stablecoin issuer Paxos over Binance USD (BUSD). The regulator also proposed rule changes targeted at crypto firms operating as custodians.\n\nMcGlone stated he is still bullish on BTC but expects the price to go down again in step with other assets if a recession hits.\n\nBack in January, he warned BTC might not see the surge being predicted just yet, as there are challenging macroeconomic conditions and pressure from interest-rate hikes.\n\nAccording to McGlone, the April 2 decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to reduce daily oil output makes a recession more likely, as does interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to clamp down on inflation.\n\n\u201cWe had our morning call this morning and our economist Anna Wong said, Yeah, their base case is for that recession to kick in Q3,\" he said.\n\n\u201cOPEC is helping that. Fed tightening is helping that. So all assets have to go down. That means Bitcoin too. It\u2019s the fastest horse in the race. So I\u2019m overall, certainly relatively bullish.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitcoin likely to outperform all crypto assets following banking crisis, analyst explains\n\nIn McGlone\u2019s opinion, it\u2019s \"seriously silly\u201d to risk not having some exposure to crypto or trying to stand in its way.\n\n\u201cThe key thing I look at simplistically for Bitcoin is, if you\u2019re a money manager, why take the risk of not having some of this revolutionary asset, particularly because it\u2019s so controversial you want to have at least some in it because you don\u2019t want to look like an idiot over history,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe smart guys get it; we\u2019re not gonna be a Blockbuster or Sears, and we\u2019re going to be part of this technology.\u201d\n\nMagazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime"

        "content": "The Bitcoin white paper has been discovered hidden deep inside Apple\u2019s system files for machines running macOS Catalina or later.\n\nLabeled as \u201csimpledoc.pdf\u201d the file appears to showcase Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision for decentralized cash, based on a public ledger, in all its nine pages of glory.\n\nThe subtle nod to the world\u2019s oldest blockchain \u2014 on the day of Nakamoto\u2019s 48th birthday \u2014 was first reported by an independent blogger, Andy Baio, on his Waxy blog.\n\n\u201cI was really trying to fix my printer,\u201d Baio told Blockworks. \u201cI was trying to scan a document with my wireless printer/scanner, but the device wasn\u2019t showing up in Image Capture after I upgraded macOS recently. Just this \u201cVirtual Scanner II\u201d device that I\u2019d never seen (or noticed?) before.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went googling for \u201cVirtual Scanner II\u201d to find out more, and there were virtually no references to it online at all, mostly just the old Twitter thread I linked to.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that thread, he mentions where the files are located on the filesystem, which I was able to confirm. I asked some friends to confirm they could see the same thing, using the little command I wrote for Terminal and they could, so I wrote about it!\u201d\n\nBaio has no explanation for why the document appears buried in an obscure folder in macOS, but says that all modern versions of the OS appear to contain it. Apple did not immediately respond to Blockworks\u2019 request for comment.\n\nBaio explains that the way to access the document is to open Terminal and type a specific command:\n\nWaxy.org\n\nHe says that if you\u2019re not an Apple aficionado, the alternative method is to \u201copen Finder and click on Macintosh HD, then open the System\u2192Library\u2192Image Capture\u2192Devices folder. Control-click on VirtualScanner.app and Show Package Contents, open the Contents\u2192Resources folder inside, then open simpledoc.pdf.)\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s more. In order to actually view the document, Baio states that there is another step: \u201cIn Image Capture, select the \u201cVirtual Scanner II\u201d device if it exists, and in the Details, set the Media to \u201cDocument\u201d and Media DPI to \u201c72 DPI.\u201d You should see the preview of the first page of the Bitcoin paper.\u201d\n\nBaio says that the document has been found by multiple friends, and Blockworks confirmed independently that it does indeed exist in the location he specifies.\n\nApple\u2019s relationship with the crypto and blockchain industry is checkered, following the tech giant allowing NFTs to be bought and sold via applications listed on its App Store in the latter half of last year.\n\nThe move was designed to enable app developers to sell NFTs in-app and new apps to install tokens within them, albeit with a catch.\n\nIn a bid to capture some of the fervor (and monetary gains) surrounding the nascent tech, Apple decided to take a 30% cut from App developers generating more than $1 million via its store, and 15% for those making less.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

A Frenchman sitting in the historic university town of Clermond-Ferrand conjures up the designs in use on CFA notes used by millions of Africans across 13 countries \u2014 despite the fact that they might never have set foot in Africa.\n\nThe CFA is currently pegged to the euro at a fixed rate of 655.957 to one. In 1994, the peg with the former French franc was slashed from 1:505 to 1:100. The currency devaluation, instigated by France and in collaboration with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, wiped out the savings of the Senegalese people. To cap it all off, French officials sit on regional central bank boards across French-speaking Africa and still hold substantial powers, including veto rights.\n\nAlex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation once explained, \u201cUnlike a typical fiat currency, the system was far more insidious. It was monetary colonialism.\u201d\n\nFrom Cuba to Turkey, South Africa to Serbia, I have never seen a greater demand or need for monetary emancipation than in Central or West Africa, and the most likely candidate for West Africa\u2019s economic and monetary freedom is Bitcoin.\n\nMaking lightning connections\n\nOn Twitter in January 2022, I noticed that a few bars in the ex-pat area of Dakar have begun accepting Bitcoin. You can pay for a cr\u00eape or a bissap (a refreshing local drink made with hibiscus flower) over the Lightning Network, at a spitting distance from the beach.\n\nMy thoughts immediately go to El Salvador\u2019s grassroots adoption initiative, Bitcoin Beach, the efforts of which culminated in Bitcoin becoming legal tender in El Salvador. I know at once that I must speak to the person behind these efforts.\n\nA tall, softly-spoken Senegalese man who spent a chunk of his professional life working in France, Nourou (not his real name), is a Bitcoin advocate like no other.\n\nNourou points to the wings of Africa during an interview.\n\nHe returned to Senegal in 2021 and was disappointed to see that his friends and even family members had lost money to \u201cPonzi schemes like Petronpay \u2014 things like that \u2014 or limo\u201d and other popular crypto scams in Africa. \u201cSo, we set up the Bitcoin in Senegal community,\u201d he tells Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cI was the first one in our first e-meet on Clubhouse. We were maybe three or four, but I kept going with two sessions per week, then one session per week because we used to have 10, 20 [\u2026] sometimes hundreds of people listening in.\u201d\n\nHe arrived in Senegal at the onset of COVID-19. However, the pandemic chaos did not dash his dreams of making Bitcoin the go-to currency in his homeland.\n\nPeer to peer\n\nWhile traveling in Senegal in February 2022, I attended the country\u2019s first-ever Bitcoin meetup. Not only was this a milestone event in of itself \u2014 as previously meetups were conducted online or on the application Clubhouse \u2014 but the caliber of the guests in attendance is jawdropping.\n\nThe room is brimming with nonfungible token promoters, Bitcoin maximalists, entrepreneurs, central bankers and even professors from Dakar\u2019s most prestigious universities. The atmosphere is a stark contrast with the Bitcoin meetups I usually attend in Europe or America, where, to be frank, it\u2019s a bunch of white Millennial males preaching the fall of fiat currencies.\n\n\n\nSenegal\u2019s first in-person BTC meetup in February 2022. Nourou is second from right, while I am fifth from left (back row).\n\nI also see Nourou onboard three more restaurants onto the Bitcoin network. Interestingly, a lot of these merchants use Bitcoin in its purest form: a peer-to-peer cash system.\n\nThey accept Bitcoin-based or Lightning transactions, and they hold onto it with the intent of using Bitcoin as money in a circular economy. Nourou is building an app that allows merchants to cash out into local currency and offers a personalized service where they can get their hands on cash if need be.\n\nI left Senegal in March 2022 with a spring in my step. I felt inspired by the fact that, in the places that need it most, there are enthusiastic Bitcoin people devoting their time and efforts to educating others about money and, ultimately, Bitcoin.\n\nNow, fast-forward to August 2022, and I couldn\u2019t quite believe that Nourou is texting me, saying he had plans to host a Bitcoin forum in Senegal. It will be the first time that Bitcoiners from all over the world would assemble on the African continent to share their passion for Bitcoin and strategize how best to adopt the currency.\n\nI vowed to myself that I absolutely must attend. Not only is this a country that I\u2019m increasingly attached to but I fully want to observe, participate and report on the Bitcoin movements in Senegal and greater West Africa.\n\nDakar Bitcoin Days\n\nDakar Bitcoin Days gathered enthusiasts and economists from across Africa, in a pan-African celebration of magic internet money. From Cameroon to the Congo, Mali to the Ivory Coast and the Central African Republic, there were interested parties from all over the continent. As Nourou says in an interview while pointing at the continent of Africa, \u201cAfrica will fly if we all go together.\u201d\n\nWith Nourou backstage ahead of the start of the conference.\n\nFrance is the official language in Senegal, while Wolof is by far the most widely spoken. One of the unique and well-thought-out aspects of this conference is that there are Dakar Bitcoin Days talks in three languages \u2014 English, French and Wolof \u2014 with events in the latter attracting the highest attendance.\n\nThe conference features beginner-friendly seminars that touch on the economy, finance, security and Bitcoin fundamentals. For experts, panels on cryptography take place, while debates such as \u201cIs Bitcoin Halal?\u201d provide cultural insights into using Bitcoin in Senegal, a 97% Muslim country. Plus, the demographics skew incredibly young: The average age in the country is roughly 19 and the conference is brimming with students and young people.\n\nDuring the conference and in conversations, Nourou shares his vision for Senegal with me. Senegal will lead West Africa out of the darkness of currency colonization, he explains. However, there needs to be a level of decentralization in the messaging regarding Africa:\n\n\u201cI want the message to switch. Africa is not a country \u2014 it is a continent. That\u2019s why we call it Dakar Bitcoin Days: If you come to Senegal, you will meet Senegalese; if you go to Mali, you meet Mali people.\u201d\n\nThere might be some similarities, such as some shared histories and overlapping cultures in Africa, but he explains that Africa is just as varied or more than Europe. Much like Bitcoin, the movement is decentralized. Each region and area of Africa will eventually run with and adopt Bitcoin.\n\nThat\u2019s not to take away from the tremendous sense of Pan-Africanism that Africa benefits from. It\u2019s something that that Europeans or Americans as a continent may not relate to. I am British and European, but I do not relate with a Serbian the way that a Senegalese may relate to a Zimbabwean, despite being thousands of miles apart.\n\nBitcoin in Senegal\n\nDuring the conference, I also set out to interview merchants who accept Bitcoin. I speak to the owner of a French ex-pat bar that has recently begun accepting Bitcoin. Despite being completely new to decentralized currency, the proprietor, Gary, is happy to see new customers coming to his bar thanks to Bitcoin. While we were there, we managed to convince him to accept Bitcoin at his brand-new tattoo parlor.\n\nA tattoo parlor now accepting BTC.\n\nSenegalese surf team coach Ren\u00e9e Laraise managed Pra\u00efnha, the first restaurant to accept Bitcoin. As one of Senegal\u2019s best sporting exports after football (Senegal won the African cup of Nations in 2022), he\u2019s a leader and a trusted voice in the community.\n\nI also interview Mama Bitcoin, who has been trading Bitcoin for fish on the Atlantic coast for the past three years. It\u2019s a visionary move in a country where cash reigns king and banking services are generally for the financially privileged. Banks in West Africa charge high fees and incur strict user requirements: Withdrawing cash, for example, can cost a few dollars.\n\nThroughout my second trip to Senegal, I give out Bitcoin to more than 70 people. The process is simple: I ask them to download a Lightning wallet, usually Wallet of Satoshi, and they tap receive.\n\nThe wallet is custodial, meaning they don\u2019t actually hold the keys to their Bitcoin. As a result, they are trusting that Wallet of Satoshi will not perform a Sam Bankman-Fried and run off with the funds, but for newbies, I think it\u2019s a great place to start.\n\nI send them a few thousand satoshis, which is maybe a dollar or two in Bitcoin. I find it easy to hand out sats in Senegal in comparison with other countries to which I travel. People are eager to get hold of money, and they are eager to learn, trade or simply save with a currency that cannot be debased or stolen in the way that the CFA can.\n\nI give away free Bitcoin to conference-goers. As you can see from onlookers smiling away, it became part of the conference\u2019s entertainment.\n\nI gave away sats on the beaches, on the sidewalk, during the conference, in restaurants and bars, to taxi drivers, and in tips to the hotel staff.\n\nFor the most part, I give Bitcoin to young people, boys and girls aged anything from 16 upward and young men. Whereas the average age in the United States is about 40, Senegal is a very young population. It\u2019s no surprise that a mobile native, internet-based currency would fly if it was given the right to take off in Africa.\n\nIt makes me wonder, Why are people so keen to get hold of Bitcoin here? Well, it\u2019s because, in the West, we buy Bitcoin through exchanges; a select few individuals buy peer-to-peer, and a tiny slither of Bitcoin enthusiasts actually earn Bitcoin. In West Africa, it\u2019s very hard to get your hands on the coin.\n\nWorse still, it\u2019s very hard to secure Bitcoin. None of the established hardware wallets like Ledger, Trezor or ColdCard ship to Senegal. Ledger sponsored the conference and may start shipping to West Africa, but it\u2019s currently a serious pain point.\n\nIn light of these barriers and opportunities, it gives greater credence to the idea that a Bitcoin-circular economy could take off in Senegal. People want Bitcoin; there are no exchanges to buy from, and international tourists coming to Senegal can spend Bitcoin. Bitcoin could, therefore, tread a path to becoming peer-to-peer money, as its white paper intended, in the country.\n\nMobile money meets Lightning\n\nPlus, mobile money networks have taken root and flourished across Africa. First rising to fame in Kenya, where the globally recognized mobile money company M-Pesa was founded, mobile money companies have popped up across Africa like Apple Stores in European cities. Most Africans nowadays have a smartphone \u2014 they might not have regular electricity or access to free drinking water \u2014 but they can get online.\n\nFailing that, it is highly likely that individuals possess an SMS mobile phone: an old-style phone that can send and receive texts. Thanks to mobile money, users can send and receive payments much like a bank transfer. You can simply text your friend\u2019s phone with credit. In Senegal, the biggest mobile payments company is called Wave.\n\nThe Wave logo is found in taxi companies, restaurants, bars and caf\u00e9s. It\u2019s a bit like the Lightning Network, but it\u2019s slower, a lot more expensive, and it uses local currency.\n\nI try to track down an employee at Wave to orange-pill them \u2014 and introduce them to the Bitcoin network \u2014 and as luck would have it, I bump into one in a bar while watching the World Cup. I immediately ask him to download a wallet and sent him some Bitcoin. The internet connectivity was very patchy where we sat, so it wasn\u2019t the best, and it took a few seconds, cue \u201cNetwork Error.\u201d\n\nI connect to the bar\u2019s WiFi and send him the Bitcoin. He was impressed and said he\u2019d come along to the conference the following day, but I didn\u2019t see him again.\n\nThere was a funny moment during the interview with the marketing director from Wave. He shared that he met and hung out with Satoshi in Senegal. Apparently, he was a VC kind of guy who went around, drunk as a skunk, partying and investing in companies.\n\nThe face you make when someone says they know Satoshi.\n\nHowever, it gets me thinking \u2014 you have a country that is accustomed to transacting via mobile phone, using nothing but a mobile number. That\u2019s despite the fact that the UX for mobile money is quite clunky. Yet everyone and their goat (yes, I try to interview a goat about Bitcoin \u2014 see our documentary), knows how to use it.\n\nSenegal has a power-sapping currency, a young, digitally native population, Bitcoin leaders and mentors in respected positions in society, an annual conference, an increasing number of merchants accepting Bitcoin, and as evinced: It is culturally acceptable to send money via mobile phones.\n\nIt\u2019s another instrument in Africa\u2019s Bitcoin toolbelt and a way in which the continent could effectively leapfrog the developed world. Why can\u2019t we leapfrog mobile money with the Lightning Network?"

        "title": "Bitcoin Miners Making Critical Energy Moves - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining is a notoriously energy-intensive endeavor. As a result, pro-renewable energy politicians and regulators frequently criticize bitcoin miners for their heavy carbon footprints.\n\nRecent data from the University of Cambridge\u2019s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index indicates the power consumed to mine blocks recently hit an all-time high. Perhaps that\u2019s a symptom of the cryptocurrency\u2019s 2023 rebound, but the point is that miners need to reduce their carbon footprints and increase consumption of green energy.\n\nSome are already doing that, and if the industry proves it\u2019s making material progress on reducing its dependence on fossil fuels, exchange traded funds such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) could benefit.\n\nSATO, which turns two years old in October, holds 37 stocks \u2014 a slew of which are classified as crypto miners. Already under siege from policymakers to reduce emissions and embrace renewables, bitcoin miners, including SATO components, don\u2019t need to be compelled to go green. After all, some experts believe high energy costs were part of the problem for the sector last year.\n\n\u201cMiners aren\u2019t out of the woods just yet. Inflated power costs will remain a stubborn thorn in the industry\u2019s side, and could quickly worsen if governments succeed in saddling miners with an added energy tax,\u201d according to a recent report from Coin Metrics. \u201cEven with the latest rally in Bitcoin price, daily revenue for the S19 has barely cracked $7, making every penny count. Without a sustained uptrend, mining margins may soon revisit the cold depths of winter 2022, when the average S19 briefly operated at a loss of more than $1.22 per day.\u201d\n\nThe good news for some SATO member firms is data, as measured by bitcoin mining emissions intensity, indicates miners are making strong headway on reducing carbon emissions.\n\nAs Beincrypto.com reports, venture capitalist Daniel Batten recently noted bitcoin mining\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels has declined by more than 6% a year since the start of 2020.\n\n\u201cAs reported by BeInCrypto in late March, Bitcoin mining is now greener than electric vehicle technology. Hydroelectric energy is Bitcoin\u2019s major power source, according to Batten,\u201d reported the publication. \u201cAccording to Cambridge University, the BTC network currently consumes around 140 TWh per year. However, this is still less than the 206 TWh per year lost in the U.S. due to transmission and distribution.\u201d\n\nSATO components have good reason to trim emissions in an effort to placate regulators, but there\u2019s more benefit in that strategy. By delivering from fossil fuels, miners can potentially lower costs, boost profits and support sustainability credentials.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel .\n\nThe opinions and forecasts expressed herein are solely those of Tom Lydon, and may not actually come to pass.

        "content": "\u2018Miners are setting up operations without telling anyone\u2019\n\nRob Altenburg, director, PennFuture Energy Center\n\nVENANGO COUNTY, Pa. \u2013 Coal is the environmental problem that keeps finding ways to harm communities across this state, with proof of work bitcoin mining creating another way to pollute as crypto companies look to waste coal to power their operations.\n\nWith two bitcoin mining operations in the Keystone State, Stronghold Digital Mining has a sleek website with a glossy video boasting that its energy intensive operations are actually an \u201cenvironmentally beneficial\u201d way to \u201cremediate the impacts of 19th and 20th century coal mining in some of the most environmentally neglected regions of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe company talks a good game, claiming to be more of a coal refuse reclamation company than a bitcoin miner. Stronghold\u2019s co-chairman and CEO boasts that his company is saving communities living near coal refuse from further environmental harm in addition to cleaning up dangerous coal refuse piles. He says this burning produces no nitrogen oxide emissions.\n\nBill Spence, co-chairman and CEO of Stronghold Digital Mining, shows off the Scrubgrass Power Plant, where large shipping containers house thousands of bitcoin mining machines.\n\nImage\n\nPhoto credit: Associated Press/Andrew Rush, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nStronghold mixes waste coal with limestone and then sends it to a circulating fluidized bed combustor that produces steam to generate electricity.\n\nA byproduct of the process is coal combustion waste, or coal ash, which can be reused in small amounts in products like wallboard and fertilizer, but which also has a notorious history. In 2008, a coal ash storage pond in Tennessee collapsed, sending more than 5 million cubic yards of the waste into the Emory River. A similar coal ash spill in North Carolina, in 2014, sent unburned carbon and various metals, including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, selenium, and zinc into the Dan River, threatening drinking water, wildlife, and agriculture.\n\nStronghold, a publicly traded company, has two waste coal-fueled generating facilities: the 85 MW Scrubgrass Plant, in Venango County, Pa., and the 80 MW Panther Creek Plant, in Carbon County, Pa. Before the company bought these coal plants, in 2021, they were all but closed, with electricity generation and coal consumption dropping 95 percent between 2014 and 2020.\n\nStronghold claims to be saving Pennsylvania communities by taking piles of waste coal stored out in the open and burning it for bitcoin mining. But the process still ends up producing more coal ash. During 2022, the company combusted about 1 million tons of waste coal and returned nearly 700,000 tons of coal ash to waste coal sites.\n\nThe waste coal the company burns to mine bitcoin is low-quality coal discarded by previous coal-mining operations. That\u2019s because its low energy content and high contamination levels rendered the coal unfit for commercial sale. So burning waste coal is not only more inefficient but also more pollution-intensive than burning even commercially marketed coal.\n\nStronghold takes the ash leftover from burning coal refuse and spreads the ash back over land areas in what is termed \u201cbeneficial use\u201d as fertilizer by the state. Coal ash is known to contain all the heavy metals and a wide variety of other toxic substances found in coal that are concentrated when the coal is combusted. When coal ash is spread over the ground, every time it rains these toxic pollutants like arsenic, cadmium, and many others, are washed into nearby streams and rivers, polluting groundwater throughout the watershed.\n\nNot only does burning coal waste create carbon emissions that contribute to the climate crisis, but it also increases emissions of heavy metals, acid gasses and air toxics. These pollutants can hurt communities living closest to the facilities that are powering crypto mining, including some areas that have been historically disproportionately affected by pollution.\n\nDespite environmentally friendly claims, under Stronghold\u2019s ownership the plant has burned 830 percent more waste coal, compared to 2020, and in 2022 waste coal consumption was up by about 1,800 percent over 2020 \u2013 the most since 2014.\n\nAfter more than six years of steadily declining emissions at the waste coal plants, Environmental Protection Agency monitoring data show the company\u2019s bitcoin mining activity increased emissions of sulfur dioxide by 351 percent in 2022, to 1,965 tons, and nitrogen oxides by 1,224 percent, to 645 tons, compared to 2020 levels. The company\u2019s waste-coal-fueled crypto mines also released over 1.4 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2022.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re turning the ground pollution into air pollution and really not paying attention to the downwind impacts,\u201d says PennFuture Energy Center Director Rob Altenburg.\n\nOther bitcoin miners in the state are cropping up at natural gas well pads almost overnight, with some detected only by accident, says Altenburg. \u201cMiners are setting up operations without telling anyone,\u201d he adds, often with huge shipping containers stacked with mining hardware.\n\nThat makes the fight against proof of work bitcoin operations almost like a game of environmental whac-a-mole, with communities often surprised by the arrival of so-called data centers, which turn out to be bitcoin mines that promise jobs and other boosts to the local economy that often fail to materialize. But it doesn\u2019t mean the fight is impossible.\n\nIndeed, PennFuture and other environmental advocates are leading the charge against bitcoin operations because of their reliance on coal and other dirty fossil fuel power sources, particularly those that are reviving once-shuttered fossil fuel power plants.\n\n\u201cFossil-based crypto mining operations pose the same environmental and public health threats as their underlying methods of energy generation,\u201d wrote Altenburg and representatives from Clean Air Council and Earthjustice in a January 17, 2023, letter to state regulators. The advocates were opposing the use of a gas well pad in Elk County, Pa., that had the goal of powering proof of work mining.\n\nNot only does burning coal waste create carbon emissions that contribute to the climate crisis, but it also increases emissions of heavy metals, acid gasses and air toxics.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Proof of work is a ridiculously energy-guzzling approach to crypto mining that bitcoin remains wedded to, despite the existence of alternative consensus mechanisms. Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, last year \u201cmerged\u201d to using a process known as proof of stake, which uses 99 percent less electricity than proof of work. It obviates the need to harness dirty fossil fuel power, as the energy demands of proof of work no longer exist.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective as an environmental advocate, if you are going to do crypto blockchain . . . do it with proof of stake and don\u2019t waste energy \u2013 change the code,\u201d says Altenburg. \u201cThere\u2019s no unique thing that bitcoin brings to the table, aside from name recognition and a highly inflated market cap, that other coins don\u2019t do and probably do better.\u201d\n\nBut communities have few options to force bitcoin miners to change their ways, and fights over planned or existing crypto mines remain largely case-by-case, he notes."

        "content": "There\u2019s another wave of NFTs starting to flood the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014and they\u2019re not in the form of Ordinals.\n\nThe emergent STAMPS (Secure Tradeable Art Maintained Securely) protocol is proposing a different method of embedding image data into the OG blockchain, making different tradeoffs compared to the inscription technology that exploded in popularity earlier this year.\n\nRather than storing image data within prunable transaction witness data, \u201cBitcoin Stamps\u201d store it directly within spendable transaction outputs.\n\n\u201cBy doing so, the data is preserved in such a manner that is impossible to prune from a full node, preserving the data immutably forever,\u201d wrote pseudonymous Stamps creator Mike In Space on the project\u2019s GitHub page. The developer noted that he is already in discussions with Emblem and Hiro Wallet to arrange protocol integrations, the former of which will allow users to buy and sell Stamps on OpenSea.\n\nMagic Eden\u2019s New Bitcoin NFT Marketplace Dominates Ordinals Market\n\nAs Ordinals growth surged in early February, proponents argued that they were superior to NFTs on other platforms because they store image data within the Bitcoin blockchain. By contrast, Ethereum NFTs are usually just image pointers to centralized hosting services, which can be changed by anyone with control of the image URL.\n\nYet even Ordinals data can be pruned by choice by individual node runners, limiting the immutability and decentralization benefits of such NFTs. As such, Bitcoin Stamps go all the way, forcing nodes to store their image data across many different unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).\n\nThe NFT is then broadcast across the network using Counterparty\u2014an old protocol that ushered in Bitcoin images back in 2014 before the term \u201cNFT\u201d even existed.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are good for the preservation of art forever by storing them securely on the strongest ledger ever devised by man backed by Proof of Work,\u201d the creator told Decrypt via DM. He added that other services are already being built atop the STAMPS protocol, such as a Name Service by Rarity Garden.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith 11,000 NFTs Minted to Bitcoin, Are Bitcoin Maxis Coming Around?\n\nBut storing data across all Bitcoin nodes comes at a cost\u2014quite literally. In fact, the protocol creator suggests using Stamps for lightweight \u201c24x24 pixel, 8-color-depth PNG or GIF\u201d files to make up for their implicit storage costs.\n\n\u201cThe constraints of this \"canvas\" are ideal for pixel art,\u201d he wrote on GitHub. \u201cIn particular, the CryptoPunks use a native resolution of 24x24 pixels.\u201d\n\nStamps also come with the benefit of being \u201csemi-fungible\u201d: they can be issued as \u201c1 of 1\u201d or \u201c1 of many\u201d digital assets. Trevor.btc on Twitter, host of The Ordinals Show, recognized this feature as similar to the Ethereum ERC-1155 multi-token standard, and as a reason for their remarkably fast growth.\n\nThe Stamps website shows that over 8,300 Stamps have been minted since their launch on March 7, compared to under 500 Ordinals within the same time period after their launch.\n\nThat said, the number of Ordinals on Bitcoin only continues to grow, now standing at over 910,000 inscriptions to date, according to Dune Analytics. Major brands including Bored Ape Yacht Club and Bugatti have already adopted the tech."

        "content": "\u2018They almost look like fortresses, with barbed or razor wire surrounded by open prairie\u2019\n\nMelissa Nootz, Montana Environmental Information Center campaigns and advocacy director\n\nBIG HORN COUNTY, Mont. \u2013 Big Sky Country has a big air pollution problem, thanks to cryptocurrency mining. Air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise as a result of flaring, coal-fired power plants and other energy sources working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, just to \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin.\n\nSnapshots of some of the bitcoin mining operations blighting the Montana landscape show just how out of place the operations can be: Rolling prairie land, bales of hay, the very image of peace and serenity \u2013 then row after row of metallic gray rectangular facilities that house mining machines whirring on a never-ending schedule. Noisy giant fans atop the mining containers stand out like oversized pimples on the horizon. And dramatic orange flames twist skyward from nearby gas flares used to power the mining computers, individually no bigger than two shoeboxes but gathered together by the hundreds or thousands.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the flaring of natural gas that powers these mines, because Montana illustrates perfectly how this smoke-and-mirrors industry has turned to resurrecting once-closed coal-fired power plants in order to generate the electricity needed by bitcoin mining. Proof of work crypto mining is putting these dirty fossil fuel power sources back to work.\n\nPreying on the impoverished\n\nAs residents of the second poorest county in Montana, the people in Big Horn County could have been forgiven for thinking there might be a jobs boost after cryptocurrency miner Marathon Digital Holdings agreed to let the owner of a local coal-fired power plant generate the electricity for its bitcoin mining needs.\n\nInstead, the county got spikes in emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides once energy-intensive bitcoin mining operations began. Emissions increases can have devastating impacts on people living nearby, costing the U.S. economy billions through premature deaths and illnesses, and carbon dioxide adds to the climate crisis.\n\nPrivate property sign posted in front of Hardin Generating Station, in Hardin, Mont.\n\nImage\n\nPhoto credit: Associated Press\n\nThe Montana plant, known as the Hardin Generating Station, owned by Beowulf Power, was first slated to close by 2018, until the deal with Marathon extended the facility\u2019s life for years.\n\nIn Hardin\u2019s prior life as a coal-fired power plant generating electricity for the surrounding area, the Montana Environmental Information Center, or MEIC, an environmental advocacy group, successfully fought to impose modern air pollution controls. But even with those safeguards, the revived Hardin plant still produces emissions that threaten public health and add to the climate catastrophe as it works overtime for crypto mining.\n\nPolluting pristine wilderness\n\nThe American Lung Association\u2019s 2022 \u201cState of the Air\u201d report gave Missoula County, Mont., an \u201cF\u201d for the air pollution caused by particulate matter, also known as soot, emissions over 24 hours. MEIC warned it could put at risk the health of people breathing that air. Energy generation for bitcoin mining \u2013 whether that\u2019s flaring gas in an open prairie field or bringing a coal-fired power plant back to life \u2013 inevitably leads to more air pollution.\n\nFlare gas burning outside of mine in Hardin, Mont.\n\nImage\n\nPhoto credit: Montana Environmental Information Center\n\nIn 2021, Marathon\u2019s operations at the Hardin plant produced 755,700 tons of carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 its highest annual emissions since 2014. That year it also generated 304 tons of sulfur dioxide and 245 tons of nitrogen oxides.\n\nThe amount of coal used to generate electricity at the facility had declined over 82 percent from 2014 to 2017, when the Hardin plant\u2019s closure was originally announced. But in 2021, when Marathon began mining bitcoin at an adjacent facility, the coal plant\u2019s output increased by 816 percent. During the first three months of 2022, it was on track to raise its output by another 45 percent over the 2021 level, with emissions increases an inevitable byproduct.\n\nToday, even the crypto mines using renewable sources of power draw criticism. Opponents say the facilities leech power and further stress already strained renewable energy supply chains that should be used for communities and other critical infrastructure.\n\nBitcoin miners \u2018not upfront\u2019\n\nNeighborhoods are often not told when crypto mines will appear, finding out only when they see flare gas burning or hear the constant noise from the machines and cooling fans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very opaque,\u201d says Anne Hedges, MEIC director of policy and legislative affairs. \u201cThese companies are not upfront about what they are doing.\u201d\n\nMarathon last year announced plans to shutter the Hardin plant and transition to 100 percent carbon-neutral bitcoin production with renewable power sources.\n\n\u201cMarathon made a commitment for our mining operations to be 100 percent carbon neutral by the end of 2022,\u201d said Marathon Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel in an April 2022 statement.\n\n\u201cTo achieve that goal, we have endeavored to ensure our miners are as sustainably powered as possible. . . . [W]e believe it is an appropriate time to transition our legacy operations away from fossil fuel generation and towards more sustainable sources of power,\u201d Thiel said.\n\nHardin is still operating, Hedges says, despite Marathon\u2019s pledges to move its operations to Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear whether there\u2019s another operation in there.\u201d\n\nNoisy giant fans atop the mining containers stand out like oversized pimples on the horizon.\n\nSome crypto mines are incongruous with the otherwise picture-perfect landscapes of Montana, further harming the quality of life for residents exposed to the facilities\u2019 air and noise pollution, while also having to put up with jarring images of unsightly mining operations.\n\n\u201cSome of these mines are just rows on rows of shipping containers in the most remote parts of Montana,\u201d says Melissa Nootz, MEIC campaigns and advocacy director. \u201cThey almost look like fortresses, with barbed or razor wire surrounded by open prairie.\u201d\n\nHedges wants to see federal action rein in crypto mining and is calling for strict regulation of the industry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But in the absence of comprehensive federal policy, communities are left to fight proof of work mines on their own.\n\nThat requires people to be vigilant, monitoring the news for stories about bitcoin mines coming to town. Hedges warns some operations might call themselves \u201cdata centers\u201d \u2013 a term that describes a very different type of facility, and that companies sometimes use to disguise what\u2019s actually a bitcoin mine. She also suggests tracking environmental permits and pushing to restrict the zoning of bitcoin proof of work operations.\n\nBut, she notes, it can be an uphill fight. Missoula County in 2021 established first-in-the-nation zoning regulations restricting where and how crypto mines can be located. \u201cWe got really lucky, because that\u2019s the most progressive county in Montana,\u201d Hedges says. \u201cIn the rest of the state, zoning is a four-letter word.\u201d"

In prior four-year cycles after previous halvings, BTC/USD has displayed patterns of behavior that continue to hold true today.\n\n\u201cWhen using Days from the Bitcoin Halving (where the inflation rate of new Bitcoins is halves); we can see that Bitcoin peaks around 368\u2013550 days post halving and then bottoms 779\u2013914 days post cycle,\u201d Filbfilb summarized.\n\nRelated: Crypto winter can take a toll on hodlers\u2019 mental health\n\nGenerating a so-called \u201cprice curve,\u201d his analysis shows that it may be possible to get a rough idea of where BTC/USD will top and bottom in the coming halving cycles.\n\n\u201cBy combining expected halving dates and days to cycle tops and cycle bottoms alongside extrapolated regression of price data, it is possible to use this model in predicting where Bitcoin price may reside at the peak and trough of future cycles,\u201d he continued.\n\nBitcoin price curve chart (screenshot).

        "content": "On April 4, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback\u2019s performance versus a basket of six leading foreign currencies, dropped by 0.5% after demand for workers in the world\u2019s largest economy declined.\n\nBTC\u2019s price eyes breakout with dollar at two-month lows\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has since grown 3.5% to around $28,800, continuing its extremely negative correlation with the dollar.

        "content": "Hedge fund manager Jesse Myers believes Bitcoin is on its way to a staggering $10 million per BTC.\n\nIn a new interview with Coin Stories, Myers breaks down the math and the timeline behind his big prediction.\n\nMyers says Bitcoin is emerging as a hard and scarce store of value in a world of ever-increasing debt and currency devaluation.\n\n\u201cWe have now entered an era where the value proposition of holding bonds or holding fiat money is very bad, because the national debt and the unfunded liabilities going forward are going to necessitate a level of printing that will outpace the nominal yield on holding bonds.\n\nThat\u2019s the only way out we have. We now have $31 trillion of national debt, $170 trillion of unfunded liabilities in the US alone.\n\nThen you\u2019re talking about $3 trillion a year in interest expense when we\u2019re already running a multi-trillion dollar deficit in our budget. So you\u2019re talking about something like $4 trillion dollars of deficit going forward that you have to print in order to make that up\u2026\n\nSo that\u2019s what Bitcoin is competing with as the lowest hanging fruit, I think in terms of where people have their value parked.\u201d\n\nMyers says Bitcoin is competing in an asset world that totals about $900 trillion in size, with a current level of global crypto adoption that is far less than some analysts believe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of how much can Bitcoin win, how much value can Bitcoin actually take here. It is currently a $400 billion asset in a $900 trillion ocean. That means it\u2019s 1/2000th of the world\u2019s value, and that means collectively the world has a 0.05% percent allocation to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMyers says Bitcoin\u2019s maximum supply of 21 million BTC will create a massive supply shock as the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s rate of adoption increases.\n\nHe then breaks down the math that brings him to $10 million per BTC in today\u2019s dollar terms, which is centered on Bitcoin capturing half of gold\u2019s market cap as well as additional percentages of the world\u2019s top store of value categories.\n\nAs for his timeline, Myers says the key factor is how long it will take for the general public to gradually learn more about Bitcoin and understand its true value proposition. He believes his price target will become a reality within the next few decades.\n\n\u201cI think we have begun the Bitcoin era, where having BTC as a major if not primary pillar of your personal savings strategy is the winning formula. And it will take a generation for people to really get the picture.\n\nSo when I when I say Bitcoin has, I think, a conservative chance of becoming $10 million dollars a coin in today\u2019s dollars, that means going from 0.05% of the world\u2019s value to 25% of the world\u2019s value.\n\nBitcoin is just going to suck it in, ingest it like a black hole. That\u2019s what I think we\u2019ve embarked on now and it will only be really clear in hindsight that those are the mechanics that were playing out right before people\u2019s eyes while everyone was convinced that this was just Monopoly money.\u201d\n\nAs for the potential risks to Bitcoin\u2019s future, Myers says regulatory roadblocks are a top concern.\n\nHe also believes Bitcoin\u2019s virality is key to its future, and that it\u2019s imperative for those who understand its benefits to spread the word and educate the next wave of investors.\n\nYou can check out the full interview here.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere\u2019s another wave of NFTs starting to flood the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014and they\u2019re not in the form of Ordinals.\n\nThe emergent STAMPS (Secure Tradeable Art Maintained Securely) protocol is proposing a different method of embedding image data into the OG blockchain, making different tradeoffs compared to the inscription technology that exploded in popularity earlier this year.\n\nRather than storing image data within prunable transaction witness data, \u201cBitcoin Stamps\u201d store it directly within spendable transaction outputs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBy doing so, the data is preserved in such a manner that is impossible to prune from a full node, preserving the data immutably forever,\u201d wrote pseudonymous Stamps creator Mike In Space on the project\u2019s GitHub page. The developer noted that he is already in discussions with Emblem and Hiro Wallet to arrange protocol integrations, the former of which will allow users to buy and sell Stamps on OpenSea.\n\nAs Ordinals growth surged in early February, proponents argued that they were superior to NFTs on other platforms because they store image data within the Bitcoin blockchain. By contrast, Ethereum NFTs are usually just image pointers to centralized hosting services, which can be changed by anyone with control of the image URL.\n\nYet even Ordinals data can be pruned by choice by individual node runners, limiting the immutability and decentralization benefits of such NFTs. As such, Bitcoin Stamps go all the way, forcing nodes to store their image data across many different unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).\n\nThe NFT is then broadcast across the network using Counterparty\u2014an old protocol that ushered in Bitcoin images back in 2014 before the term \u201cNFT\u201d even existed.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are good for the preservation of art forever by storing them securely on the strongest ledger ever devised by man backed by Proof of Work,\u201d the creator told Decrypt via DM. He added that other services are already being built atop the STAMPS protocol, such as a Name Service by Rarity Garden.\n\nBut storing data across all Bitcoin nodes comes at a cost\u2014quite literally. In fact, the protocol creator suggests using Stamps for lightweight \u201c24x24 pixel, 8-color-depth PNG or GIF\u201d files to make up for their implicit storage costs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe constraints of this \"canvas\" are ideal for pixel art,\u201d he wrote on GitHub. \u201cIn particular, the CryptoPunks use a native resolution of 24x24 pixels.\u201d\n\nStamps also come with the benefit of being \u201csemi-fungible\u201d: they can be issued as \u201c1 of 1\u201d or \u201c1 of many\u201d digital assets. Trevor.btc on Twitter, host of The Ordinals Show, recognized this feature as similar to the Ethereum ERC-1155 multi-token standard, and as a reason for their remarkably fast growth.\n\nThe Stamps website shows that over 8,300 Stamps have been minted since their launch on March 7, compared to under 500 Ordinals within the same time period after their launch.\n\nThat said, the number of Ordinals on Bitcoin only continues to grow, now standing at over 910,000 inscriptions to date, according to Dune Analytics. Major brands including Bored Ape Yacht Club and Bugatti have already adopted the tech."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFor Bitcoin miners the motive to power their operations with renewables is clear\u2013it's economical.\n\nPer data from MacroMicro, it costs $26,979 to mine a Bitcoin on average. With the price of the leading cryptocurrency hovering around $28,500, cutting costs is key to fattening miners\u2019 margins.\n\nMining outfits that can tap cheaper energy powered by renewables, such as wind, hydro, or nuclear, are thus at a clear advantage over their competition.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s more, beyond heftier profits, these miners also claim to be using \"excess\" energy that might not otherwise be used to power their operations.\n\nAccording to Marathon Digital Holdings\u2019s corporate communications VP Charlie Schumacher, Bitcoin can be helpful for renewable energy grids, in particular, by offering a profitable use of energy in places where there is higher energy production than demand.\n\nMarathon draws energy from more than 200 wind turbines to power its mining operation in McCamey, Texas.\n\n\"Renewables don't always happen to be where we have large populations,\" Schumacher told Decrypt. Such is the case at King Mountain Wind Farm which is hundreds of miles from the nearest large city.\n\n\"Because electricity can only travel about 500 miles before it's fully wasted, you need to be close to the source,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you're further away, it's less efficient.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMiners also serve as ever-buying consumers for energy producers in these regions. Bitfarms\u2019 chief mining officer Ben Gagnon makes a similar argument regarding his firm's use of hydropower in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nGagnon told Decrypt that to reduce energy costs, Bitfarms ends up \"seeking out energy sources that don't have other customers' demand.\"\n\nThis has led the company toward a pattern of essentially filling in the gaps left behind by old manufacturing hubs.\n\n\"We took over former industrial buildings\u2026paper mills and metal shops\u2026[industries] that basically were outsourced to third world countries,\" Gagnon said. \"The dams are still there. They've been paid off. The water still falls from the sky. It still melts from the snow. It still flows through the rivers, but there's just no demand for that electricity.\"\n\nIs it really \u2018excess\u2019 energy?\n\nWhether the energy being used can actually be called excess, however, is still up for debate.\n\nA representative from Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, the public utility company that provides energy for Bitfarm's Canadian operations, told Decrypt that \"there is no such thing as excess energy for Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. We manage our network in order to produce electricity in real time to answer the demand.\"\n\nHydro-Qu\u00e9bec is also expecting an energy demand increase of 14%, or 25 terawatt hours (TWh), over the next ten years.\n\nBut even if there isn\u2019t an excess of energy, many firms claim that Bitcoin mining is nonetheless easier on the grid than other types of production such as heavy industry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Miners have the capacity to turn on and off very quickly, in a matter of minutes,\" Marathon Digital\u2019s Schumacher said. \"That load can be turned on and soak up energy, or it can be shut off\u2026faster than most other industries.\"\n\nHe added that because wind and solar power are intermittent power sources\u2013generating more or less power at different times throughout the day\u2013it's important to have more consumers, like miners, who can be flexible with how they consume energy as grids transition to these sources.\n\nFrom Bitcoin to fuel cells\n\nPeople working on renewable energy systems tend to look to other processes for using or storing surplus energy.\n\nGreen hydrogen production is one alternative solution because electricity is used to generate hydrogen fuel which can be stored and converted back to power when it's needed.\n\n\"Hydrogen can make grids more efficient because it's an energy storage material,\" senior consultant of political affairs for the German Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association Johannes Drijkoningen told Decrypt. \"What's stored in H2 are electrons.\"\n\nElectricity can be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen in a process called electrolysis, and the resulting hydrogen can then be used to make clean fuels for vehicles, or stored and converted back into electricity via fuel cells when energy is needed later.\n\nOther projects that commonly compete for renewable energy contracts include solar panel production or green-aluminum or steel production.\n\n\"We always have to think twice about where our energy is going,\" Drijkoningen said. \"When it comes to [Bitcoin] mining, I personally don't see an added value for society or myself, compared to using electricity for heating, food production, or other basic human needs.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBroader conversations about energy use and priorities on local and national levels will continue to develop into the future.\n\nBut for Bitfarm\u2019s Gagnon, Bitcoin mining still offers an economically productive use of energy in the short term. He suggested that he understands the growing interest in projects related to battery manufacturing, hydrogen, and solar, but added that these types of projects can take decades to construct and launch.\n\nHe argues that in the shorter term, Bitcoin miners can create jobs and tax revenue with the energy that is available today.\n\n\"It's a 20-year hypothetical versus a 12-month implementation schedule [for Bitcoin mining],\" he said. \"A Bitcoin miner could be promised, 'You've got the power for the next 15 years, but after that, you've got to move on.' And Bitcoin miners would take that\u2013they'd absolutely do that.\""

I remain the largest individual shareholder and Cathedra is the most promising investment I have in the space. If I had any doubts about the Company\u2019s prospects, I would not have made this decision. Indeed, it is my confidence in the existing Board along with the management team which gives me peace of mind as a long-term shareholder.\n\nI have enjoyed my time on the Board and would like to thank my fellow directors for their diligent work over the past few years.\"\n\nStatement from Drew Armstrong:\n\n\"We thank Roy for his service during his five-year tenure at Cathedra. Roy\u2019s vision and prudence have directly benefited shareholders, employees, and partners alike. We look forward to Roy\u2019s continued support as a shareholder.

Now, MicroStrategy has spent a total of $4.1 billion on the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency\u2014making it the public company with the largest stash of Satoshis in the world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIts long-term bet on the cryptocurrency is close to becoming profitable after the asset had wild price swings since 2020: its 140,000 BTC were bought at an average price of $29,803 per coin\u2014meaning that if the asset jumps in value by 6%, or $1,780.91, the company will have made a profit.\n\nThe latest buy comes as Bitcoin has a great start to 2023: it is currently trading for $27,958 per coin, according to CoinGecko data. At the start of the year it was priced at $16,615.\n\nBut despite soaring in value this year, Bitcoin is still down 60% from the all-time high of $69,044 it touched in November 2021.\n\nMicroStrategy has acquired an additional 1,045 #bitcoin for ~ $29.3M at an average price of $28,016 per bitcoin.

Please withdraw them and, if you can, self-custody.\u201d\n\nBitcoin peer-to-peer markets are getting getting a lot more pressure. @paxful just suspended its marketplace. pic.twitter.com/UKLkICZcfm \u2014 calle \u26a1\ufe0f (@callebtc) April 4, 2023\n\nThe blog post cited \"key staff departures\" and \"regulatory challenges for the industry,\" but Youssef said during a Twitter space on Tuesday that the decision to close the platform was also influenced by a lawsuit brought by a Paxful co-founder who is suing Paxful and Youssef after being \u201ckicked out of the company\u201d more than a year ago.\n\n\u201cMy co-founder sued the company and sued me,\u201d Youssef said. \u201cI have a lawsuit over my head right now.\u201d\n\nThough he did not name the plaintiff explicitly, Youssef is likely referring to co-founder Artur Schaback, who filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against Youssef in January, according to a court docket hosted on CourtConnect.\n\nSchaback could not be reached for comment by Decrypt.\n\n\u201cPaxful is a nominal defendant in the litigation, so we cannot share much around the case,\u201d a Paxful spokesperson told Decrypt, also declining to identify the plaintiff. \u201cBut I can confirm that Artur Schaback is a co-founder and current board member of Paxful.\u201d\n\nPaxful Vows to Refund Celsius Earn Bankruptcy Victims\n\nThe announcement of Paxful\u2019s closure comes just days after Youssef promised to make Paxful Earn customers whole. The service had allowed Paxful customers to earn a yield on Bitcoin through a partnership with Celsius, a prominent crypto lender that filed for bankruptcy last July.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Paxful spokesperson told Decrypt that, despite the company\u2019s impending closure, Paxful\u2019s wallet is operational, and \u201cusers can get their funds out safely.\u201d\n\nPaxful database is a bit overloaded now as everyone is withdrawing funds. It is making transfers slow. I promise funds r safe and they will clear soon \u2014 Ray Youssef (@raypaxful) April 4, 2023\n\nYoussef claimed that Paxful\u2019s senior staff were largely driven away from the company because of actions taken by the unnamed co-founder\u2019s legal team. Youssef added that the co-founder refused to pay some of Paxful\u2019s employees.\n\n\u201cHis litigation team was really nasty,\u201d he said. \u201cThey drove away all of our senior-level staff who just couldn't deal with this guy anymore.\u201d\n\nBy this past Friday, it had gotten to the point where there were no engineers, compliance team members, or security personnel left working at the company, Youssef said. Ultimately, he said he decided at that point to shut the company down due to security concerns.\n\nYoussef claimed he subsequently hired an engineering team to assume control of Paxful\u2019s digital wallet\u2014presumably still being used for safekeeping funds. He said it was the right thing to do, even though it conflicted with a court order that he\u2019s received.\n\n\u201cI've managed over the weekend to get an engineering team to secure everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to make an ethical decision.\u201d\n\n'Integrity Over Revenue' Says Paxful CEO After Booting Ethereum From Platform\n\nPaxful was originally founded in 2015, and it is the latest firm to succumb in the midst of crypto winter. The company is headquartered in New York and has offices in Estonia, the Philippines, and Russia, according to a press release.\n\nAt one point, the company allowed customers to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2014the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization\u2014along with the leading stablecoin Tether. But the company dropped support for Ethereum last December.\n\nYoussef said that Paxful was ultimately successful in the sense that it fostered Bitcoin adoption in West Africa and other areas of the Global South. According to Coin Dance, trading volume on Paxful totaled around $35 million in the past week, with users based in countries like Argentina, Kenya, and India."

That remains to be seen. While BTC is unproven as an inflationary hedge, it is definitely the highest beta monetary irresponsibility hedge out there.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the increase in oil prices was initially thought to risk a return of inflationary forces, allowing the Fed to continue its rate hikes.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "title": "Debunking the myth: Cryptocurrency is used for criminal activity - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency is often associated with criminal activity, but this is mostly a myth, especially today. Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies don\u2019t provide complete anonymity due to the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policies implemented by most crypto exchanges. Even without KYC scanning, law enforcement agencies can easily track crypto transactions to identify criminal activity, as the blockchain is transparent and immutable.\n\nIn 2019, United States Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that Bitcoin was a national security issue, since it had been used for illicit activities. To him, cryptocurrencies were dominated by illegal activities and speculation. But the facts say otherwise.\n\nThough illicit crypto volumes reached an all-time high at $20.6 billion in 2022 (primarily due to sanctioned entities), the share of all crypto activity linked with illegal activity was only 0.24%.\n\nSource: Chainalysis\n\nThis pales in comparison to the $800 billion\u2013$2 trillion laundered through traditional financial systems in fiat \u2014 about 2% to 5% of the global GDP.\n\nOne of blockchain\u2019s defining features is its inherent transparency. All transactions are logged on a publicly accessible ledger, allowing anyone to view the entire codebase at any time. Utilizing cryptocurrencies for illicit activities leaves a clear trail of evidence that prosecutors can use to secure convictions. Europol and the Basel Institute on Governance have emphasized the importance of cryptocurrencies in combating organized crime. It is virtually impossible to transfer significant amounts of crypto without getting noticed.\n\nCrypto exchanges share expertise and resources with law enforcement agencies\n\nContrary to popular belief, crypto exchanges continue to be one of the primary allies in the fight against criminal activity. For example, Binance, the world\u2019s largest exchange by trading volume, has been very active in helping authorities in line with its mission to further security of the larger crypto ecosystem.\n\nIn 2022, the Binance Investigations team responded to over 47,000 law enforcement requests, with an average response time of three days, which is significantly faster than any traditional financial institution.\n\nBinance has assisted many critical operations that brought down criminal groups operating with dozens to hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. In 2021, the Binance Investigations team played a vital role in an international investigation with law enforcement agencies from Ukraine, South Korea, the U.S., Spain and Switzerland that dismantled a cybercriminal ring responsible for over $500 million in illict activity. The group, known as Fancycat, had been running multiple criminal activities, such as distributing cyberattacks, operating a high-risk exchanger, and laundering money from dark web operations and high-profile cyberattacks like Cl0p and Petya ransomware.\n\nIn most cases, crypto exchanges are not used in order to harbor criminals, but act as intermediaries for laundering stolen or otherwise ill-gotten profits.\n\nSource: Binance\n\nBesides sharing resources and being involved in cybercrime investigations, Binance is actively helping law enforcement staff with understanding how blockchain and cryptocurrencies operate and may be used in illicit activities. In September 2022, the crypto exchange formally launched its Global Law Enforcement Training Program, which includes individual and group training, workshops and other activities. The training program is led by a team of skilled professionals, including security experts and former law enforcement officers who participated in the crackdown on Silkroad and Hydra.\n\nBinance is proactively building a more secure crypto ecocystem and working with law enforcement around the world to help detect financial and cybercrimes and assisting the prosecution of bad actors.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies remain the spearhead of the collective fight against crime. Acquiring the required resources, skills and tools to reduce illicit crypto activity is imperative, and crypto exchanges like Binance play a crucial role, thanks to their position.\n\nLearn more about Binance"

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nCrypto options exchange Deribit's forward-looking bitcoin volatility index (DVOL) offers clues about the market's expectations for price turbulence over the next 30 days, just as the Chicago Board Options Exchange's volatility index, VIX, does for equities.\n\nA key difference has emerged this year. While the VIX continues to serve as Wall Street's fear gauge, rising during bouts of risk aversion, the DVOL has developed a positive correlation with the cryptocurrency's price. The 30-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin's price and the DVOL index flipped positive in early January and rose to a high of 0.85 last week. At press time, the coefficient was 0.72. That has made call options tied to bitcoin (BTC) more attractive than ever, according to observers.\n\n\"Since the start of 2023, bitcoin has displayed a strong spot/implied volatility regime of positive correlation. That has flipped 2022 on its head,\" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto data provider Amberdata, told CoinDesk. \"It's been rewarding call buyers with directional spot gains and increasing volatility gains.\"\n\nDVOL, introduced in early 2021, measures bitcoin's 30-day implied or expected volatility using Deribit's options order book. The VIX is based on the options prices of the S&P 500 stock index.\n\nOptions are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, a signal the holder has a bullish stance, while a put option gives the right to sell. Options prices are determined by several factors, including market direction as well as implied volatility, which is influenced by the supply and demand for options.\n\nDVOL's positive correlation with the cryptocurrency's price means call options stand to benefit from both favorable directional movement and an uptick in implied volatility. In other words, calls are likely to see faster price appreciation during bullish moves than puts during bearish moves.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Assuming the spot/vol correlation persists, this raises the appeal of owning calls as a call buyer can hit a 'double whammy,' winning on both Delta [directional gains] and Vega [implied volatility gains] in a sharply rising market,\" Spencer Hallarn, an over-the-counter trader at crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR, told CoinDesk.\n\nCaught off guard\n\nThe positive correlation is in stark contrast to last year, when bitcoin's turn lower after an 18-month bullish trend caught traders off guard, leading to panic buying of put options. At the time, DVOL spiked during notable price declines and puts saw faster price appreciation during bearish price action than calls during corrective rallies.\n\nCBOE's VIX index rises during bearish market environments and falls or holds steady when the market rallies. That's because stock traders tend to be long-term bullish and are quick to snap up puts for protection on the first signs of weakness in the stock market. Demand for protection dissipates when the market rallies, leading to a decline in the VIX. The net effect is that puts see faster appreciation in value during market swoons than calls do during risk-on trends.\n\nDVOL acted as a fear gauge in 2022, spiking during notable price sell-offs. The situation has changed this year with implied volatility moving in lockstep with the cryptocurrency's price.\n\nBitcoin rallied almost 70% in the first three months of the year, contradicting expectations for a continued market decline. According to OTC tech platform Paradigm, funds have been piling into bullish positions via options.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, could soon kick in, driving stronger demand for options and pushing DVOL higher.\n\n\"The crypto market can sometimes spike up and everybody then wants to be fully in it (FOMO, especially since we came down from the $68K level),\" Pierino Ursone, head of options at Deribit, said while explaining DVOL's positive correlation with the price. \"When extra demand for out-of-the-money higher strike calls kicks in for crypto, one should beware it can be really strong and persevering.\""

Despite both being publicly traded companies, how they account for that bitcoin in their financials has created controversy and generated headlines.\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s proposed guidance, released March 23, aims to \u201cimprove the accounting for and disclosure of certain crypto assets.\u201d When it sought comments from stakeholders in June 2021, the FASB received an overwhelming number of responses seeking clarity on crypto accounting and reporting. That December, FASB Chair Richard Jones added a project to explore accounting for and disclosure of crypto holdings.\n\n\n\nCurrent guidance states that companies should classify crypto as long-lived intangible assets in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350. Businesses that don\u2019t qualify as investment companies should record cryptocurrency at historical cost and only adjust it if the fair value declines. Once holdings are written down, companies can\u2019t revise the value back up if the price recovers.\n\nThis accounting often doesn\u2019t reflect the economics or the nature of how a company is using digital assets. Many market participants believe it limits overall transparency and comparability of financial reporting information.\n\nThough the FASB proposal has a narrow scope, it represents a significant milestone. Crypto assets covered by the exposure draft include those that:\n\nMeet the intangible asset definition in the Codification Master Glossary;\n\nDon\u2019t provide the asset holder with enforceable rights to, or claims on, underlying goods, services, or other assets;\n\nAre created or reside on a distributed ledger or blockchain;\n\nAre secured through cryptography; and\n\nAre fungible.\n\nThe proposal doesn\u2019t cover items such as:\n\nNon-fungible tokens;\n\nStablecoins;\n\nWrapped tokens;\n\nGovernance tokens; and\n\nCrypto created or issued by the reporting entity or its related parties.\n\nAccording to the new proposal, crypto assets would be measured at fair value under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, with any changes in fair value reported in comprehensive income each reporting period. Certain costs incurred to acquire crypto assets, such as commissions, would be recognized as an expense unless a company follows specialized industry measurement guidance that requires otherwise.\n\nThe aggregate amount of crypto assets would be presented separately from other intangible assets that are measured using other measurement bases. Gains and losses on crypto assets would be reported in net income separately from the income statement effects of other intangible assets, such as amortization or impairments. Crypto assets received as noncash consideration during the ordinary course of business that are converted nearly immediately into cash would be classified as operating cash flows. Finally, disclosures would mirror those in ASC 820 with a few added disclosures to capture the types of significant crypto assets held, activity, and any restrictions on sale.\n\nFollowing the current accounting model, companies mark down the value of their crypto to the lowest fair value observed during the holding period. This reduces net assets and requires companies to record an impairment expense that reduces net income.\n\nWhen or if the fair value of the crypto goes back up, the company isn\u2019t permitted to increase the value of the asset on its balance sheet; the value of the crypto on its balance sheet remains at the lower value despite its higher trading value. These effects often paint a distorted picture of a company\u2019s financial results and may dissuade companies from holding crypto assets at all.\n\nFor example, Tesla bought bitcoin in the first quarter of 2021. Because of a decline in the value of bitcoin, its holdings are now valued at less than the original purchase price. As a result, Tesla recorded $305 million in impairments of its crypto since the purchase date.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean it sold and lost $305 million worth of bitcoin or that its bitcoin was worth $305 million less at the end of 2022. What it does mean is that in the past couple of years, Tesla\u2019s bitcoin holdings declined in value by $305 million, which presumably reflects a write-down to the single lowest bitcoin price over that period. The markdown was included as an impairment expense on the income statement, meaning Tesla reported lower earnings per share than if it hadn\u2019t purchased bitcoin.\n\nUnder the existing rules, if bitcoin were to recover to $65,000 per coin in 2023, Tesla wouldn\u2019t be allowed to increase the value of its bitcoin to $65,000, despite having the ability to sell on the open market and realize substantial gains (which it did to the tune of $192 million over the same period). It\u2019s a lose-lose situation from a financial reporting perspective.\n\nThe new FASB proposal is widely seen as a step in the right direction for companies that hold crypto, but there are still several unanswered questions. For example, how does a company treat stablecoins, NFTs, wrapped tokens, or governance tokens?\n\nFor the time being, the industry likely will have to chalk up FASB\u2019s new guidance as a win, albeit maybe not the resounding blow-out win they were hoping for when this first started.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin OGs are skeptical of a report published by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) on Wednesday, detailing how Bitcoin miners are \u201cpolluting\u201d communities across the United States.\n\nWorking through six case studies, the non-profit group says it has documented how the mining industry is interfering with the day-to-day life of Americans through air, water, and noise pollution.\n\n\u201cThe incessant din created by mining operations continues 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and is driving nearby residents to desperation,\u201d the report stated. One of its case studies followed a married couple in Cook County, Georgia, whose hearing has reportedly been \u201cdamaged\u201d thanks to one of Blockstream\u2019s neaerby Bitcoin mining facilities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnother case study focused on Stronghold Digital Mining in Venango Country, Pennsylvania. The company combusts coal refuse to power Bitcoin mining machines, then spreads the leftover coal ash over land areas to be used as fertilizer. EWG argued that the toxic pollutants within that ash fertilizer are carried into nearby rivers and streams when it rains, thereby polluting the water.\n\n\u201cWhat these mines have in common is their use of proof of work, which is wasteful by design,\u201d the report asserted, calling it \u201chighly inefficient\u201d to require vast amount of \u201cfossil-fuel generated electricity\u201d to operate.\n\nProof of work is a consensus mechanism used by Bitcoin and other decentralized blockchains that allows all network participants to agree on the sequential order of transactions, while also issuing new coins in a non-subjective manner. Powerful computers compete in a race to construct Bitcoin\u2019s next block of transactions by solving a complex math problem and are rewarded with new BTC for solving it first.\n\nMany modern blockchains use an alternative consensus mechanism called proof of stake, which uses cryptocurrency rather than energy to secure the network. EWG has long called for Bitcoin developers to change its code and cut its energy use in a similar fashion, backing another well-funded environmental campaign to do so.\n\nHowever, prominent Bitcoin developers are not remotely interested in such a high-stakes protocol change. Blockstream CEO (and suspected Bitcoin creator) Adam Back says energy costs for producing new Bitcoin are necessary for it to function as money.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople are buying digital gold, to protect against inflation and monetary erosion. Central banks are buying physical gold for similar reasons at a record pace,\u201d he said to Decrypt via Twitter. \u201cGold is costly to mine analogously, and that's also inherent to hard money.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by EWG about Blockstream\u2019s noise pollution, Blockstream mining head Chris Cook described the facility as \u201cbarely audible... crickets are definitely louder.\u201d\n\nLong-time Bitcoin developer Luke Dash Jr. also contested that Bitcoin was a source of environmental harm, arguing that the fiat currency system is much more harmful.\n\n\u201cPoW is actually good for the environment,\u201d he told Decrypt via DM. \u201cIt makes clean energy like solar viable on its own, where previously it would typically require fossil fuel to compliment it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the developer dismissed proof of stake as a \u201cscam,\u201d referencing a 2015 essay describing the system as \u201cunworkable.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy depending only on resources within the system, proof of stake cannot be used to form a distributed consensus, since it depends on the very history it is trying to form to enforce loss of value,\u201d stated the report\u2019s author Andrew Poelstra."

LunarCrush, a crypto and NFT stock trading platform founded in 2018, has chosen a more prosaic motivation: cold hard cash.\n\nA stash of 62 Bitcoin, currently worth approximately $1.5 million (although who knows how long that will last), is to be sent to the surface of the moon, the company announced recently \u2013 where it will wait to be claimed by anybody who happens to make it up there first.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTo obtain the lunar millions, the prospective crypto hunter will need to locate a specific private key \u2013 a code that is planned to be etched onto a MAPP Rover provided by commercial space startup Lunar Outpost.\n\nAfter receiving the code, the craft will then be launched into space via a SpaceX rocket in the latter quarter of this year. When exactly that\u2019s going to happen is yet to be confirmed, however \u2013 an omission that LunarCrush puts down to \u201csecurity reasons\u201d.\n\nWhatever those reasons, the delay is likely welcome: as it stands, the digital treasure chest is sitting pretty empty. LunarCrush is hoping to fund the prize by selling a collection of Bitcoin-secured NFTs, priced at $250. Of that, they say, one-fourth will go into the lunar stash; the same amount again will fund a \u201cCommunity Marketing Wallet\u201d dedicated to funding Bitcoin core development and STEM education-related causes (the destination of the other half of the total is left to our imaginations).\n\nIt's arguably something of a gamble to count on NFTs \u2013 a medium that is equally as famous for its flops and failures as its successes at this point. Worldwide interest in the once-Zeitgeisty tech has pretty much never been lower, with the average price dropping by close to 90 percent last year to well below the $250 price tag asked by LunarCrush.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile $1.5 million may sound like an enticing bounty, it pales in comparison to what a jaunt to the moon would likely cost, at least using current tech. It was less than a year ago that NASA boasted of how cheap its upcoming CAPSTONE moon mission was set to be \u2013 a trifle at just under $10 million. Even at that price tag, NASA isn't sending up any astronauts or rovers \u2013 just a single, microwave-oven-sized robotic probe that is only designed to orbit.\n\nOf course, the teams behind the Bitcoin campaign refuse to let a simple thing like the limits of current human progress cow their aspirations: \u201cWhen you put out a seemingly unachievable goal, the innovation that happens can be incredible,\u201d said Joe Vezzani, CEO of LunarCrush, in a statement for PR Newswire.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to inspire people to build communities that will unlock a new era of exploration,\u201d he said. \u201cWe envision classrooms, groups, companies, and even DAOs [decentralized autonomous organizations, referring to an organization running on blockchain] coming together to reach the Moon and split the treasure chest's rewards. It's like Willy Wonka's \u2018golden ticket\u2019 for the Web3 era, and we couldn't be more excited to see how it all unfolds.\u201d\n\nIt's a surprising comparison: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is pretty famously a rags-to-riches story about how the purity of heart can triumph over greed and determination. Should anybody end up winning the stash of Bitcoin, on the other hand, they\u2019ll need to be the kind of person or group able to drop at least seven figures on a pet project that will, perhaps, earn them back 10 percent of their spend.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSo, less Charlie, more Veruca Salt. And we all know how that ended up, don\u2019t we?"

        "content": "Toronto police investigators say they have recovered a portion of funds lost by a senior who fell victim to a bitcoin scam that cheated he and his wife out of $400,000.\n\nIn a news release issued Tuesday, police said the couple wanted to invest their savings and were allegedly approached online by a scammer who communicated with them over the phone.\n\nPolice say the scammer presented as \"professional and knowledgeable in the field\" and asked the man to invest in an online platform called \"cryptos-seed.com.\"\n\nThe couple was then persuaded to send funds via a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange to a cryptocurrency wallet provided by the scammer, according to investigators.\n\nPolice say the man was then provided with credentials for the scam website where it appeared his investment was growing \"significantly,\" when in fact, he had sent his money directly to the person in question.\n\nThe man eventually asked to withdraw his funds, but was met with multiple excuses and was told to invest more money or pay large fees to have the funds released, police say.\n\nInvestigators were able to recover a \"significant portion of lost funds\" and return them to the couple, though the news release does not state exactly how much money was lost.\n\nPolice say investigators are still trying to identify the suspects involved, who may be located in another country.\n\nInvestigators are appealing to anyone who believes they may have been a victim of a similar scam to contact police.\n\nTips on how to avoid being scammed\n\nDet. Const. Sean Vandecamp says scams like this are very common. He is urging the public to be cautious when solicited online for any investments.\n\n\"It is not likely that the funds are recovered via cryptocurrency, that's why this is such a great success story,\" he said in an interview with CBC Toronto.\n\nIt's not just crypto \u2014 a recent CBC Toronto investigation revealed that fraud reports in Ontario have skyrocketed over the last decade, with only a sliver of annual reports leading to criminal charges. Those scams include everything from Ponzi schemes, to romance scams and fraudsters selling people's houses out from under them.\n\nAndreas Park, a professor of finance at the University of Toronto, says crypto users are particularly vulnerable because they can hold their assets in self custody and, as a result, are free to send their money to anyone they want.\n\n\"With this great freedom that you have comes the responsibility \u2014 and the problem \u2014 that if you send it to the wrong person, it's just gone,\" he said.\n\nPark says the best way to combat the problem is with education around crypto scams.\n\n\"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,\" he said.\n\nVanessa Iafolla, a fraud prevention consultant and instructor at Wilfred Laurier University, agrees.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency is designed to be anonymous. It's designed to be something that's meant to be difficult to trace,\" she said.\n\n\"If you're not familiar with cryptocurrency, don't touch it. Educate yourself, speak with someone who's part of a legitimate organization.\"\n\nPark urges people to consider holding their assets with a registered investment company like Wealthsimple. If people decide to keep their assets in their own digital wallet, he encourages them to use what's known as a \"hard wallet\" \u2014 a psychical device that stores a person's private keys and allows them to securely access their cryptocurrency.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ontario Securities Commission has a list of registered and approved cryptocurrency exchanges that can be found on its website."

On-chain data indicates that in the medium term the upward momentum may be maintained although a correction after impressive gains in Q1 2023 seems likely.\n\nBitcoin's spot price is currently well above the average blockchain BTC purchase price i.e. Realized Price (around $19,800). According to Glassnode, the cryptocurrency market is currently in a key transition phase between a bull market and a bull market. The upper limit of this phase is marked by the Realized Price to Liveliness Ratio in the vicinity of $33,000, which could be an important resistance level. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe ratio compares the value of BTC held by long-term investors in one cycle (6m-2y) to short-term holders (1d-3m). The structure of the RHODL indicator indicates a sharp change in trend that began with the collapse of FTX, with BTC sold by long-term investors to a new group of buyers. The sudden drop in the index in earlier cycles was seen as a turning point. Source: Glassnode The indicator measures the change in supply based on the length of time BTC is held in portfolios. It is positive (green) when BTC 'ages' at a faster rate (low propensity to sell) and negative (red) when the rate of sales exceeds the accumulation and conviction rate of HODLers. The period of spending was relatively short-lived (the collapse of FTX) and we again see a green color advantage with more than 60,000 BTC added to HODLers' balances per month.

        "content": "MicroStrategy is unrelenting with its Bitcoin purchases as it recently spend more than $29 million on over 1,000 BTC.\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) has continued amassing more Bitcoin and has purchased an additional 1,045 BTC. The business intelligence firm announced it spent $29.3 million on the recent purchase, at an average of $28,016 per Bitcoin. According to a tweet from co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy\u2019s portfolio now has 140,000 Bitcoins. The company spent a total of $4.17 billion at an average of $29,803 per coin.\n\nThe American intelligence company has been buying Bitcoin for a few years. Its first purchase was in August 2020, when it spent about $250 million on 21,000 Bitcoins. At the time, Microstrategy made headlines as one of the first public companies to keep crypto as a store of value after transferring funds from its treasury.\n\nMicroStrategy Bought More Bitcoin Last Week, Paid Off Silvergate Loan\n\nIn March, MicroStrategy announced that it bought 6,455 Bitcoins, spending $150 million on the transaction. The company said it bought the Bitcoins at an average of $23,238 per coin over five weeks. At the time, the company had a total portfolio of nearly 139,000 Bitcoins.\n\nIn addition to buying more Bitcoin, MicroStrategy announced that it prepaid the loan from the collapsed crypto-focused Silvergate Bank. According to an SEC filing, the company paid a total of $161 million of the $205 million loan. After the payment, MicroStrategy received 34,619 Bitcoins held as collateral for the transaction initiated in March last year. The intelligence firm confirmed it paid the loan after raising $339.4 million from selling MSTR shares.\n\nMicroStrategy decided to repay the loan even though payment was not due until Q1 2025. According to the company, no BTC was custodied with Silvergate, even though the loan used Bitcoin as collateral. This assured MicroStrategy shareholders that even through Silvergate\u2019s bankruptcy, MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin collateral was safe. The firm also allayed fears in a March tweet, saying that apart from the loan, both companies have \u201cno other financial relationship\u201d.\n\nMicroStrategy and Bitcoin\n\nMicroStrategy has been bullish about Bitcoin for a long time. The company has continued purchasing the king coin even during biting bear markets. However, MicroStrategy recently suffered a slight loss after selling some of its Bitcoin.\n\nIn December, MSTR hit its lowest level since August 2020 after a Bitcoin sale. This first-ever sale saw MicroStrategy offload 704 Bitcoins for about $11.8 million. The company said it sold the Bitcoin for tax reasons and confirmed it bought another 810 Bitcoins two days after. However, MSTR fell 1.1% and hit $136.63 following the announcement. At the time, the stock was at a 75% year-to-date (YTD) plunge.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s continuous Bitcoin purchases have worried several investors. According to Matt Maley, the chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, some investors are jittery. Maley said investors had hoped MicroStrategy would \u201cscale back their holdings\u201d following Salor\u2019s decision to leave the CEO position.\n\nAccording to a Jefferies analyst, Brent Thill, MicroStrategy may face some problems soon. Thill has said that the company could soon struggle with liquidity because its current position has too much leverage for Bitcoin."

        "title": "Experts define challenges, growth factors in bitcoin ATM market - ATM Marketplace",
        "content": "What's driving the bitcoin ATM market? There are several factors to consider including security and accessibility. However, there are also issues holding it back. Let's take a look at both.\n\nBitcoin ATMs have quickly become a ubiquitous staple in many retail spaces. You can find them in places ranging from gas stations to supermarkets. In fact, there are now more than 37,000 machines in operation worldwide, according to CoinATMRadar.\n\nThere are multiple factors driving this growth, including accessibility.\n\n\"Bitcoin ATMs are still a popular investing avenue for consumers because they offer accessibility in an industry that otherwise still has high barriers to entry,\" Gabriella Kusz, CEO of the Global Digital Asset and Cryptocurrency Association, said in an email interview. \"As more people become interested in buying crypto with cash, the easy-to-use, familiar technology allows consumers to securely expand and diversify their portfolio. Bitcoin ATMs offer a safe alternative to buying cryptocurrency, taking various steps to mitigate fraud risk and implement safeguards for investors. As the demand for bitcoin ATMs continues to grow, we will likely continue to see them placed everywhere from bustling cities to quiet suburbs.\"\n\nBitcoin ATMs are also easier to use on the retailer's side as well, while also providing a profit.\n\n\"The regulatory environment for cryptocurrency varies from country to country, but in many places, there are few restrictions on bitcoin ATMs. This has made it easier for operators to set up new machines and expand their networks,\" Mark Fidelman, founder of SmartBlocks, said in an email interview. \"Bitcoin ATMs can be a profitable business for operators, as they often charge a percentage fee on transactions. As more people use bitcoin ATMs, the potential for profits increases, which can encourage more investment in the market.\"\n\nThe security side is also important as users can more easily make transactions on bitcoin ATMs and ensure the cryptocurrency stays on their own wallets, rather than having to go through an online exchange.\n\n\"Some people prefer to use Bitcoin ATMs for the privacy they offer. Unlike some online exchanges, Bitcoin ATMs do not require users to provide personal information, which can be appealing to those who want to keep their transactions anonymous,\" Fidelman said.\n\nHowever, there are also some issues within the bitcoin ATM industry. For one, the growth of bitcoin ATMs has slowed down significantly \u2014 in some cases many bitcoin ATMs being removed. On Feb. 28, for example, there was a net reduction of 1,061 bitcoin ATMs. In addition, the speed of installations has dropped, currently sitting at around three deployed per day, according to CoinATMRadar.\n\nThere have been several suggestions as to why the market is being held back. One is that despite it being simpler than some cryptocurrency companies, there is still a lack of regulatory clarity.\n\n\"While the regulatory environment for cryptocurrency is generally becoming more favorable, there is still a lack of clarity in some jurisdictions regarding the legality and regulation of Bitcoin ATMs. This can create uncertainty for operators and potential users of the machines,\" Fidelman said.\n\nOne example of this is the recent push by the Financial Conduct Authority of the U.K. to crack down on unregistered crypto ATMs. The authority is claiming cryptocurrency ATMs in the country are not registered, which can lead to money laundering. In the U.K., all cryptocurrency companies must register with the FCA.\n\nFidelman said other factors holding back the industry include limited acceptance of cryptocurrency, high transaction fees and security concerns.\n\nThere is also the issue of a major bankruptcy in the industry. Recently, Cash Cloud, the operator of Coin Cloud ATMs filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada. The company was in debt for an amount between $100 million and $500 million.\n\n\"The recent bankruptcy of Coin Cloud, a Bitcoin ATM operator, has raised concerns about the overall health of the Bitcoin ATM industry. Some industry experts suggest that the bankruptcy of Coin Cloud may be an indicator of a larger issue in the Bitcoin ATM market,\" Fidelman said.\n\n\"The industry is relatively new and rapidly evolving, with many operators lacking the experience, financial backing, or business acumen needed to succeed in a competitive market. Furthermore, the regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrency is often uncertain, presenting challenges to Bitcoin ATM operators. However, despite the challenges, the Bitcoin ATM market has continued to grow in recent years, with an increasing number of machines being deployed worldwide, and more people using them to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Thus, while the bankruptcy of Coin Cloud has raised concerns, some analysts view it as an isolated incident, rather than a reflection of broader issues in the industry.\"\n\nLastly, a major issue that needs to be addressed is educating the public on cryptocurrency. While it has become more mainstream, many businesses are unaware of the benefits of deploying a bitcoin ATM.\n\n\"Despite industry shakeups, investors are still interested in crypto but often don't know where to start,\" Kusz said. \"Even though bitcoin ATMs employ simple to use technology, companies still need to offer guidance and education within the crypto space to ensure that new investors are making educated decisions that align with their financial goals. In providing two-way communication and trustworthy customer support, companies can encourage return customers and increase participation in the DeFi community.\""

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nTensions between Paxful co-founders Ray Youssef and Artur Schaback spilled into public yesterday, as the peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange abruptly announced it had suspended operations. While Schaback hopes to resume operations, Youssef has apparently recommended a new provider to Paxful users.\n\nIn a Tuesday message posted to Paxful\u2019s website, Youssef\u2014the company\u2019s CEO\u2014urged Paxful\u2019s users to withdraw funds from its platform and explore alternative venues, citing the departure of key employees and ongoing regulatory headwinds in the U.S. He wrote that it was unclear whether Paxful will resume operations, suggesting that its future was in jeopardy.\n\nDuring a subsequent Twitter Spaces, Youssef said that a lawsuit filed against Paxful and himself by Schaback was an untenable factor weighing on the firm, claiming that it prompted important team members to quit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI couldn't do it anymore, ethically, so I took some massive legal liability, and I said [...] I'm shutting this down,\u201d Youssef said. \u201cHe had a court order preventing me from doing anything, but I said, fuck that.\u201d\n\nSchaback told Decrypt that Paxful\u2019s decision to suspend operations came as a shock. And while he conceded that the platform's suspension of operations could end things entirely, Schaback said he plans to get the marketplace up and running again.\n\n\u201cI was not expecting that it\u2019s going to be permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cMy plan is to reopen Paxful again with a new business direction.\u201d\n\nSchaback claimed that Paxful\u2019s announcement yesterday was part of an \u201corchestrated\u201d effort to move the company\u2019s business outside of U.S. jurisdiction while blaming him for the company\u2019s troubles, which Youssef later denied to Decrypt.\n\nSchaback said the root of their disagreement can be traced back to 2021 when a potential deal between him and Youssef fell through. It involved potentially buying out Schaback\u2019s stake in Paxful.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe decided not to, basically, buy out my shares or find investors because he found a way to just completely take control of the company,\u201d Schaback said.\n\nWhen Youssef directed people to explore other trading venues on Paxful\u2019s website yesterday, he suggested users choose another firm called Noones\u2014a \u201csuper app\u201d with similar features labeled as \u201cRay\u2019s Recommendation.\u201d\n\nNoones\u2019 website states the company is based out of Europe and the United Arab Emirates, founded by \u201ca small group of passionate Bitcoiners who are dedicated to peer-to-peer in the Global South,\u201d including Nicholas Gregory and Yusuf Nessary.\n\nYoussef said he doesn\u2019t have a direct role at Noones but supports the company, per CoinDesk reporting. Yet, Schaback pointed out that Noones and Paxful share notable similarities\u2014including what appears to be a database of users.\n\nMultiple accounts on Twitter reached out to Paxful users on Tuesday, saying that they \u201ccan log in to Noones with your Paxful credentials & your KYC, trades, etc will be there already.\u201d\n\nFor those who use Paxful:\n\n1. A new platform recommended by Paxful CEO @raypaxful is live; Noones @noonesapp 2. You can log in to Noones with your Paxful credentials & your KYC, trades, etc will be there already. 3. Log in to Paxful then transfer your funds from Paxful to\u2026 \u2014 Grey Jabesi (@greybtc) April 4, 2023\n\nPaxful clarified on Twitter that the two companies are not affiliated, directing an account to Noone\u2019s website for raising questions or concerns. \u201cPlease be advised that Paxful is not affiliated with Noones; it is a separate platform,\u201d the firm\u2019s account said.\n\nHi, @Ianosg5. Thanks for getting in touch. Please be advised that Paxful is not affiliated with Noones; it is a separate platform. You may direct your questions and/or concerns related to Noones to their website. Thank you. \u2014 Paxful (@paxful) April 5, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome users in what appeared to be Noones\u2019 official Telegram channel said they were able to log in to the platform using their Paxful credentials without any issues, while others asked for help.\n\nThe functionality is part of several referral deals between Paxful and other marketplaces as the company looks for any passive income it can get to stay afloat while users withdraw funds, Youssef told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cI want the Paxful wallet to stay up for at least two years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means we have to get some passive revenue into the company to pay for engineers and staff.\u201d\n\nThe two co-founders expressed differing accounts not only about Paxful\u2019s potential future but also regarding the nature of Schaback\u2019s lawsuit\u2014filed in Delaware Chancery Court in January.\n\nSchaback\u2019s lawsuit accuses Youssef of several \u201cegregious, unauthorized, and self-interested actions,\u201d such as \u201clooting the Company\u2019s coffers\u201d and a \u201csurreptitious scheme\u201d meant to freeze Schaback out of Paxful, according to a court document. Youssef has denied these allegations.\n\nInstead, Youssef claimed yesterday that the lawsuit is an attempt by Schaback to extract as much money as possible from the company. \u201cMy co-founder thinks he's gonna get a nine-figure exit, and that's why he was fighting so hard to do this,\u201d Youssef posted on Twitter.\n\nA spokesperson for Paxful declined to comment to Decrypt on questions related to the lawsuit, citing the firm\u2019s role as a \u201cnominal defendant.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit notes that Youssef and Schaback are the two sole members of the company\u2019s board of directors. And as their conflict plays out, the impact of their disagreement extends far beyond Delaware or the U.S.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Coin Dance, Paxful\u2019s trading volume totaled around $37 over the past week, with a significant portion of users based in countries like Argentina, Kenya, and India.\n\nYesterday, Youssef said that Paxful was a \u201cgreat experiment\u201d in part because the firm was able to bring Bitcoin to areas of the Global South\u2014like starting in Nigeria and building out to the rest of Africa over time. He said, \u201cIt made places fertile.\u201d"

Youssef added that the co-founder refused to pay some of Paxful\u2019s employees.\n\n\u201cHis litigation team was really nasty,\u201d he said. \u201cThey drove away all of our senior-level staff who just couldn't deal with this guy anymore.\u201d\n\nBy this past Friday, it had gotten to the point where there were no engineers, compliance team members, or security personnel left working at the company, Youssef said. Ultimately, he said he decided at that point to shut the company down due to security concerns.\n\nYoussef claimed he subsequently hired an engineering team to assume control of Paxful\u2019s digital wallet\u2014presumably still being used for safekeeping funds. He said it was the right thing to do, even though it conflicted with a court order that he\u2019s received.\n\n\u201cI've managed over the weekend to get an engineering team to secure everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to make an ethical decision.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPaxful was originally founded in 2015, and it is the latest firm to succumb in the midst of crypto winter. The company is headquartered in New York and has offices in Estonia, the Philippines, and Russia, according to a press release.\n\nAt one point, the company allowed customers to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2014the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization\u2014along with the leading stablecoin Tether. But the company dropped support for Ethereum last December.\n\nYoussef said that Paxful was ultimately successful in the sense that it fostered Bitcoin adoption in West Africa and other areas of the Global South.

        "title": "Best and Worst Performing ETFs in March - Morningstar",
        "content": "Every month we check on how various exchange traded products (ETPs) are doing, and in March, the list of best performers was topped by Bitcoin Tracker One XBT Provider (0PTL).\n\nIndeed, shortly after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month, the price of Bitcoin soared above $25,000, reaching a threshold the digital currency hadn\u2019t touched since June. At the end of March, Bitcoin reached nearly $30,000, up 70% for the year.\n\nAs we explained in a recent interview, Bitcoin was among several cryptocurrencies profiting from the banking crisis, but other structural factors helped drive the rally too.\n\nEli\u00e9zer Ndinga, Director of Research at 21Shares, told us that the narrative of Bitcoin being an alternative to existing financial systems is emerging again due to rising interest rates and the fall in bond prices. Plus, cryptocurrencies are seeing additional use cases and applications like NFTs and smart contracts.\n\n\u201cThese two tailwinds really benefited the price action of crypto assets,\u201d Ndinga says.\n\nTop Performing ETFs\n\nAnother clear group winning out in March was ETFs exposed to gold and related mining stocks, with no less than eight trackers exposed to this sector within the Top 12.\n\nThe benchmark London spot gold broke through the $2,000-an-ounce level on March 20, the highest price seen in the past 12 months. There is a long-standing relationship between the economic crisis and the price of gold. When there is uncertainty in the economy, investors tend to turn to gold as a safe-haven asset, which drives up its price.\n\nBeyond events in the banking sector, this rally is arguably also associated with the uncertainty around the US Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hike moves. In this context, precious metal mining stocks tend to follow the direction of precious metal spot prices, usually amplifying its movements.\n\nWorst Performing ETFs\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the list of worst performing ETFs is topped by the iShares S&P U.S. Banks ETF (BNKS)\u2013which is exposed to the American banking sector. The panic following the collapse of two regional lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank spread like wildfire among investors concerned about possible systemic consequences.\n\nNatural gas ETCs also suffered. Lower demand helped depress gas prices in Europe from an all-time high of \u20ac340 last August to \u20ac42 at the end of March. Moreover, the success the EU has had in lowering gas consumption has reduced the short-term call on US LNG to close supply gaps. The resulting price decline meant US-EU gas spreads collapsed and investors in Exchange-traded commodities sold out. To read more about this, read our recent analysis.\n\nFinally, the fact that UBS\u2019s Credit Suisse rescue deal included a write-off of CHF 16 billion in Additional Tier-1 (AT1) capital to zero, shook bond funds and ETFs exposed to the asset class. In the bottom performer list, we find Invesco AT1 Capital Bond ETF (AT1) and WisdomTree AT1 CoCo Bond UCITS ETF - USD Acc (COCB), which lost 16.7% and 15.2%, respectively.\n\nBiggest ETFs in March\n\nMonthly top and flop performers often coincide with very volatile and therefore risky products, which should play a satellite role in your portfolio. As such, we also include an overview of the biggest European-domiciled ETPs in terms of assets, which could be more appropriate to consider among core holdings. Performance in March 2023 range from 6.2% for the iShares Physical Gold ETC (IGLN), down to the iShares Core FTSE 100 UCITS ETF GBP Dist (ISF),which lost 2.5%.\n\nTab Biggest here\n\nMethodology\n\nAccording to Morningstar data, there are about 48 percentage points between the best and worst performing Exchange-traded products (ETPs) in March, with returns for the month ranging from 20.6% to -27.4%.\n\nWe have looked at the key trends in the third month of the year, excluding inverse and leveraged funds. These instruments, being purely passive products, reflect the evolution of the markets without the bias (good or bad) of an active manager."

        "content": "A recent blog post from cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase indicates the vast majority of United States remittance fees for international transfers wouldn\u2019t apply to similar transactions conducted using cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to the exchange\u2019s research, \u201cThe US average fee rate of 6.18%, means Americans' average yearly spend is likely close to $12 billion on remittance fees.\u201d The post goes on to state that the average transaction time for such remittances ranges from one to 10 days, while similar cryptocurrency transactions usually take around 10 minutes.\n\nRemittance payments represent a sort of \u201cdouble whammy\u201d for international transactions as, typically, they require both a sending fee and a conversion fee to exchange between currencies.\n\nCryptocurrency transactions, however, tend to cost significantly less. According to Coinbase, Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees average approximately $1.50 and Ether (ETH) averages $0.75. Such fees are potentially much lower than traditional remittance fees, which, according to 6he World Bank, average 6.3%. By Coinbase\u2019s estimates, sending money via BTC and ETH is 96.7% cheaper than traditional remittance methods.\n\nWhile the report doesn\u2019t appear to have the rigor of a scientific study, it does illuminate some of the difficulties faced by the more than 1 billion people who rely on remittances and how global cryptocurrency adoption could change the financial landscape. U.S. senders, for example, were responsible for 94.9% of all remittances sent to Mexico in 2022, according to Wilson Center, a D.C.-based research institute.\n\nRelated: 9 years after the first Bitcoin ATM, there are now 38,804 globally\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that approximately 6% of U.S. adults currently hold some form of cryptocurrency with adoption rates continuing to rise since at least 2019 \u2014 with the exception of two quarters\u2019 worth of downturn at the end of 2022. If these rates can increase or maintain the status quo, a trickling exodus from traditional remittances to cryptocurrency-based international transactions could eventually disrupt how the global financial industry handles associated fees."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCo-founder of the troubled crypto exchange CoinFLEX Mark Lamb issued an open letter to Bitcoin evangelist and Bitcoin Cash promoter Roger Ver offering him an \u201colive branch\u201d of \u201ctwo years of free trading on OPNX,\u201d a newly-launched claims exchange co-founded by Lamb.\n\nThe \u201colive branch\u201d refers to ending a longstanding feud between the two, which would see Ver pay back an alleged outstanding loan to CoinFLEX.\n\nIn June last year, Lamb accused Ver of defaulting on a $47 million loan. At the time, Ver dismissed the claim as \u201cblatantly false.\u201d Since then, Lamb\u2019s claim on Ver has nearly doubled, according to a lawsuit filed by CoinFLEX against Ver back in July last year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u200b\u200b\"The first estimate of $47 million which we communicated did not include the significant loss in liquidating his significant FLEX Coin positions,\u201d read a CoinFLEX announcement at the time. \u201cNow that we have found a bid for that size, the liquidations have created a final deficit of $84 million for the account.\"\n\nThe latest open letter also asks Ver to \u201cagree on a payment plan for the $84 million USD.\u201d\n\nAlongside Ver, he included Peter Smith, CEO and founder of crypto exchange Blockchain.com, in his tweet.\n\nThe letter asks Smith to \"pay the 3 million FLEX Coin owed to us via your offshore Blockchain.com Cayman entity,\u201d likely a reference to another alleged debt that hit the press earlier this year, which, in language echoing Ver, the exchange dismissed as \u201ccompletely meritless and a work of fiction.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFLEX Coin (FLEX) is the native token of CoinFLEX\u2019s crypto exchange.\n\nUpon satisfying these conditions, Lamb promised Ver and Smith an \u201cequity stake\u201d in OPNX.\n\nVer, Lamb, and Smith did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe letter outlined the tokenization of debt meant to save CoinFLEX\u2019s creditors and the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community from \u201clong drawn-out legal processes\u201d by offering a liability token called \u201cRecovery Value USD\u201d (rvUSD) on OPNX.\n\nThe idea of rvUSD was first floated back in June last year when details of the alleged multi-million dollar debt first surfaced.\n\nThe CoinFLEX community unanimously approved of the plan the following September, as did a Seychelles court in March this year, after CoinFLEX halted withdrawals and filed for restructuring citing \u201cextreme market conditions\u201d and \"continued uncertainty involving a counterparty,\" a thinly veiled reference to Ver\u2019s debt.\n\n[ad-unit /}\n\nWhat is OPNX?\n\nThe Open Exchange (OPNX) is a bankruptcy claims exchange that was announced by co-founder Su Zhu last February. It caters to those looking to trade bankruptcy claims\u2014in cases from FTX to Blockfi\u2014and uses CoinFLEX\u2019s FLEX Coin as its native token.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe project is the brainchild of a collaboration between Three Arrows Capital (3AC) founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, and CoinFLEX founders Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam.\n\nA leaked early pitch deck drew negative responses from CoinFLEX\u2019s community after they found out CoinFLEX\u2019s founders had teamed up with the 3AC founders to raise $25 million.\n\nThree Arrows Capital was one of the larger and more well-known casualties of last year's liquidity crisis that rocked the industry in the wake of Terra\u2019s spectacular collapse last May.\n\nOPNX officially launched yesterday, with the first tradable claims token being rvUSD."

        "content": "Peer-to-peer Bitcoin platform, Paxful, with 1.5m users in Nigeria, has announced that it is shutting down its operations.\n\nThis was disclosed by the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Ray Youssef, in a blog post on Tuesday.\n\nHe said, \u201cToday, Paxful will be suspending its marketplace. We are not sure if it will come back.\n\n\u201cThis will probably come as a big shock to many. While I cannot share the full story now, I can say that we unfortunately have had some key staff departures. Also, regulatory challenges for the industry continue to grow, especially in the peer-to-peer market and most heavily in the U.S. While we work through these issues, we have taken the most secure option and ask you to explore self-custody and trade elsewhere.\u201d\n\nAccording to Decrypt, Youssef, during a Twitter Space said that the decision to close the platform was also influenced by a lawsuit brought by a Paxful co-founder who is suing Paxful and Youssef after being \u201ckicked out of the company\u201d over a year ago.\n\n\u201cMy co-founder sued the company and sued me. I have a lawsuit over my head right now,\u201d he was quoted as saying on the Twitter Space.\n\nThough he did not name the plaintiff explicitly, Youssef is likely referring to co-founder Artur Schaback, who filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against Youssef in January, based on a court docket hosted on CourtConnect.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrency is banned in Nigeria, the 2020 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report by Chainalysis, ranked Nigeria eighth in crypto adoption and usage among 154 countries included in the study.\n\nNigerian cities, Lagos and Ibadan, have also been listed as cryptocurrency hubs across the globe by crypto accounting services firm, Recap, which put together a list of the top 50 crypto hubs in 2022. Nigerian cities made it to number 14 (Lagos) and 24 (Ibadan) respectively.\n\nPaxful is credited with pioneering the use of peer-to-peer technology in the country, thus helping to expand the crypto industry in Nigeria.\n\nIn an interview with Business Africa Insider in 2022, Paxful\u2019s CEO said that Nigeria is the firm\u2019s largest market, with 1.5 million users and over $1.5 billion volume to date (since 2015).\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria banned cryptocurrencies and transactions related to them in 2021. CBN claimed that cryptocurrencies are being used for illegal activities including money laundering, terrorism financing, purchase of small arms and light weapons, and tax evasion."

        "content": "While the BRICS countries \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa \u2013 are mulling the introduction of an alternative currency to the United States dollar as global reserve money, and many people are voicing their opinion that the USD would no longer be the world standard, Bitcoin (BTC) has been touted as a substitute, and its purchasing power could be one of the reasons.\n\nAs it happens, the purchasing power of the USD, which determines the amount of products and services you can buy with it, has been steadily weakening over the years, whereas that of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset has been sharply rising since 2010, according to the macro comparison chart shared by the finance analyst known as Seth on April 4.\n\nBitcoin vs. USD purchasing power. Source: Seth\n\nDollar versus Bitcoin\n\nSpecifically, the chart shows the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers in terms of purchasing power of the consumer dollar in the US city average, which has been declining since the 1960s, dropping from 300 to the current 33.2 points (88.93%).\n\nOn the other hand, the purchasing power of Bitcoin in the same context has shown as quickly climbing, soaring from 33 in 2010 to the current 255 points, or a whopping 672.73% increase over the observable period of only 13 years.\n\nAt the same time, the list of people warning of the dollar\u2019s declining dominance as the world\u2019s reserve currency is growing, recently including former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has told his supporters and the media from his Florida home that the U.S. dollar was crashing and would \u201cno longer be the world standard.\u201d\n\nResearch from Kaiko noted on April 5:\n\n\u201cThe Dollar took a hit yesterday after the number of job openings in the US. fell more than expected (JOLTS), boosting recession fears. Although BTC remains negatively correlated with the US Dollar, the correlation is now almost negligible, falling from -60% to -23% YTD.\u201d\n\nBitcoin correlation with the USD. Source: Kaiko\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, the maiden cryptocurrency was at press time changing hands at the price of $28,500, which represents a 0.93% gain in the last 24 hours, adding up to the positive price change of 4.43% over the previous seven days and 27.11% across the past month, as charts indicate.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nNotably, Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling personal finance book \u2018Rich Dad Poor Dad,\u2019 is also skeptical about the future of the USD, recommending his followers to buy Bitcoin, gold, and silver and referring to the US fiat currency as \u201ctoilet paper\u201d and \u201cfake money\u201d that is pushing the \u201cAmerican empire to its end.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
