On Friday, Reuters reported the SEC opted against appealing an August court ruling that said its rejection of Grayscale's ETF proposal was \"arbitrary and capricious.\" The move could have broad implications for future SEC spot bitcoin ETF decisions.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nSpeaking about the next step in the process between fund managers and the SEC, Sayffart said, \u201cWe\u2019ll get more information next week and then we\u2019ll know what happens next.\" He added that the regulator still has the option to file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court, though he said this is unlikely to happen.\n\nBitcoin BTC -2.67% gave a muted response to the SEC's decision to forego an appeal.

But has cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology fully landed in Europe?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZug, a small Swiss canton nestled by a shimmering lake and framed by the Alps, is famous for its traditional cherry pie - which was particularly loved by actress Audrey Hepburn - and for its blockchain start-up hub.\n\nThere you may not be able to pay for your coffee in Bitcoin just yet, but you'll find yourself surrounded by folks working in crypto - who are actually able to pay their taxes in Bitcoin.\n\nIn this new episode of the Euronews Tech Talks podcast, we visit Zug, the heart of Europe's so-called \"Crypto Valley\", talk about trust in decentralised banking systems, and see how renewable energy sources are changing Bitcoin mining in Europe.\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain companies have spread very quickly in the European area between Switzerland, Liechtenstein and northern Italy.\n\nAccording to recent research by CV VC, a Zug-based venture capital firm, there are more than 1,100 blockchain-related entities thriving between Switzerland, Liechtenstein and northern Italy.\n\nThese companies employ nearly 6,000 people and are worth a combined $185 billion, as of December 2022. That's more than the GDP of countries like Kuwait or Morocco.\n\nYet blockchain, the technology that underpins it, remains widely misunderstood and distrusted by Europeans.\n\nOver the next three episodes, the Euronews Tech Talks team will explore the world of blockchain from a European perspective to find answers to these questions: how is blockchain already impacting life in Europe? And will crypto ever become mainstream?\n\nBitcoin, the visible face of cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin, ether, tether, Dogecoin, Cardano. None of these terms existed before 2008, but over a decade later, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are radically disrupting the world of finance.\n\nBitcoin is the most recognisable among them. It was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. The name is a pseudonym for the mysterious person or persons who developed it. Blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrency, has its roots as far back as 1991, when two scientists Stewart Haber and Scott Tanita, proposed a system to protect timestamps on documents from being interfered with.\n\nUnlike traditional currencies issued by central banks, Bitcoin is not controlled by any government or financial institution. It allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries.\n\nBut blockchain technology goes beyond Bitcoin and crypto. In our next episode, we\u2019ll feature a conversation between two experts who will tell us how it works with web3, smart contracts and NFTs.\n\nEuronews Tech Talks Podcast: Unravelling Europe's Digital Landscape\n\nIn our previous episodes, we delved into the world of generative AI from a European perspective.\n\nDo you want to know if software such as ChatGPT or Dall-e are already replacing the workforce in Europe or if we are facing a nuclear winter or a robotic paradise?

        "content": "While Bitcoin (BTC -2.89%) has soared more than 60% in value in 2023, it's still also more than 60% below its all-time high from November 2021. The current price sits at just around $26,750, pressured by higher interest rates and uncertain economic backdrop.\n\nWith this top cryptocurrency trading below $30,000 for the past 2 1/2 months, investors might be smart to take a closer look at adding Bitcoin to their portfolios. Here are some compelling reasons that's a good move.\n\nNear-term catalysts\n\nLooking out even 12 months from now, it's possible that Bitcoin's price will be significantly higher than today, which means buying it for less than $30,000 would look like a real steal in hindsight. Some powerful potential catalysts are on the horizon in the near term.\n\nEvery four or so years, Bitcoin undergoes what's called a halving. This is when the amount miners are rewarded for processing transactions gets cut in half, essentially reducing the rate at which new coins are created. Looking at past halving cycles shows us that Bitcoin could see major bullish sentiment. Between the last halving on May 11, 2020, to Bitcoin's all-time high, the price skyrocketed 661%.\n\nBasic economic theory can explain what's going on. If Bitcoin's supply of new issuance gets cut in half but demand remains steady or even rises, there is support for a higher price. The next halving is scheduled for April of next year.\n\nThe biggest news coming from the world of Bitcoin in the past several months has been that huge asset management firms have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. While the SEC hasn't made any decisions yet, instead pushing back its deadlines, there is a lot of enthusiasm that these financial products will get approved.\n\nThe belief is that if this happens, the floodgates will open, introducing fresh capital -- and lots of it -- with a regulated, accessible, liquid, and easy way to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Should this happen, it could be viewed as a major milestone for Bitcoin, transforming it into a legitimate financial asset. And again, with higher demand, the price could soar.\n\nAnother catalyst, the most unpredictable, is the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Since March 2022, the central bank has been on an aggressive path of hiking interest rates with the sole intention of getting inflation back to its 2% target. There might be one more rate hike before 2023 ends.\n\nHowever, I have the view that interest rates will have to come down sooner rather than later, mainly due to how much debt the government carries. Unless the government wants interest payments to keep taking up a sizable chunk of public spending, a looser monetary policy, characterized by lower interest rates, will need to happen.\n\nA more accommodative Fed is usually the key ingredient for a very favorable backdrop for risky assets, Bitcoin included. Investors will go further down the risk curve to achieve better returns. And this, again, can be a boon for Bitcoin's price.\n\nPatience is key\n\nThese near-term catalysts could be powerful price drivers for Bitcoin, but their potential positive impact is far from a sure thing. I'm always skeptical of price targets any Wall Street analyst, economist, or strategist comes up with. The world is inherently uncertain, with a million different variables that can affect the prices of financial assets.\n\nLet me be clear. If you are indeed bullish on Bitcoin, do not buy it hoping that it shoots up in value in 12 months. Instead, add it to your portfolio with the intention of owning it for the next decade. There's a good chance your patience will be rewarded."

Despite the absence of direct evidence of harmful activities, Microsoft cautioned about possible threats stemming from the operation\u2019s computing power and the presence of Chinese nationals in close proximity to the data center and the missile base.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft has no direct indications of malicious activities by this entity,\u201d Microsoft wrote, as per NYT.\n\n\u201cHowever, pending further discovery, we suggest the possibility that the computing power of an industrial-level cryptomining operation, along with the presence of an unidentified number of Chinese nationals in direct proximity to Microsoft\u2019s Data Center and one of three strategic-missile bases in the US, provides significant threat vectors.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin mine in Cheyenne, Wyoming, is one of several owned by Chinese nationals in the U.S. following China\u2019s ban on Bitcoin mining in 2021.

        "content": "The price of Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), is trading around a 15-month low versus Bitcoin (BTC), and the lowest since Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nWill it continue to weaken for the remainder of 2023? Cointelegraph takes a closer look at the charts.\n\nEthereum price breaks below critical support vs. Bitcoin\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair dropped to as low as 0.056 BTC earlier this week. In doing so, the pair broke below its 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA; the blue wave) near 0.058 BTC, raising downside risks further into 2023.\n\nThe 200-week EMA has historically served as a reliable support level for ETH/BTC bulls. For instance, the pair rebounded 75% three months after testing the wave support in July 2022. Conversely, it dropped over 25% after losing the same support in October 2020.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nETH/BTC stares at similar sell-off risks in 2023 after losing its 200-week EMA as support. In this case, the next downside target looks to be around its 0.5 Fib line near 0.051 BTC in 2023, down about 9.5% from current price levels.\n\nConversely, ETH price may rebound toward its 50-week EMA (the red wave) near 0.065 BTC if it reclaims the 200-week EMA as support.\n\nBitcoin bull case overshadows Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s persistent weakness versus Bitcoin is reflected in institutional capital flow data.\n\nFor instance, as of Oct. 6, Bitcoin-specific investment funds had attracted $246 million year-to-date (YTD), according to CoinShares. On the other hand, Ethereum funds have lost capital, witnessing outflows worth $104 million in the same period.\n\nNet flows into crypto funds (by asset). Source: CoinShares\n\nThe discrepancy is likely due to growing buzz about a potential spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETF) approval in the United States.\n\nTrade pundits argue that a spot Bitcoin ETF launch will attract $600 billion. In addition, Bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving on April 24, 2024, is also acting as a tailwind versus the altcoin market.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price gets new $25K target as SEC decision day boosts GBTC\n\nThe halving will reduce the Bitcoin miners\u2019 block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, a bullish case based on historical precedent that cuts new supply in half.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Getty Images\n\nA Bitcoin mine in Wyoming is on the radar of Pentagon officials.\n\nThe mine is connected to multiple Chinese companies and sits across from a Microsoft data center.\n\nThe company said that its placement near the data center, which supports the Pentagon, was unrelated.\n\nPentagon officials monitoring a Bitcoin operation in Wyoming that sits across from a Microsoft data center and a nearby military base are worried that the owners' ties to China could pose a national security threat, per The New York Times.\n\nMicrosoft believed the location could allow the Chinese government to \"pursue full-spectrum intelligence collection operations\" directed at the data center and the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, which houses ICBMs.\n\nThe crypto mining operation first came under the US government's purview after a team at Microsoft submitted a report to the Committee on Foreign Investment in August 2022. The team believed the mining operation had the potential to collect information from the data center, which supports the operational needs of the Pentagon, the Times reported.\n\n\"Microsoft has no direct indications of malicious activities by this entity,\" Microsoft wrote, per the Times. \"However, pending further discovery, we suggest the possibility that the computing power of an industrial-level cryptomining operation, along with the presence of an unidentified number of Chinese nationals in direct proximity to Microsoft's Data Center and one of three strategic-missile bases in the US, provides significant threat vectors.\"\n\nIn 2021, China banned the resource-intensive practice of Bitcoin mining .

The Times reported that the mining operation is linked to five different companies, with one company, Bit Origin Ltd., previously registered as a pork-processing company in the Cayman Islands.\n\nStory continues\n\nLi Jiaming, the president of Bit Origin Ltd., said that the Microsoft data center or the nearby military base had nothing to do with why the area was chosen. Instead, the mine was placed there because a local utility company agreed to work with Bit Origin.\n\n\"Even though we are a Microsoft neighbor and a couple of miles from the base, without power it is nothing \u2014 the business cannot succeed,\" Jiaming told the Times.\n\nOfficials who spoke with the Times cited concerns that the mines, which use an immense amount of electricity in their operations, would be used to purposefully overwhelm electrical grids to cause planned blackouts and complete other cyberattacks.\n\nUS officials have expressed growing concern that the Chinese government is attempting to target and disrupt US military operations.

        "title": "Cathie Wood's Latest Bitcoin Insights: Is Now the Time to Buy? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ark Invest, led by the visionary Chief Executive Officer Cathie Wood, has risen to prominence in recent years due to its innovation-centric investment strategies. Its priorities on assets with disruptive potential such as DNA sequencing, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology make the firm a natural fan and notable advocate of Bitcoin (BTC -2.89%) thanks to its status as the most decentralized, secure, and valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nTo shed more light on Bitcoin, Ark publishes a comprehensive report every month delving into blockchain-based metrics, investor behavior trends, and macroeconomic factors, providing valuable context on the crypto's status and potential trajectory. In the firm's most recent report, for the month of September, several crucial insights and trends were highlighted, suggesting the path Bitcoin might take in the coming months.\n\nLong-term holders: A steadfast base\n\nOne of the key indicators emphasized in Ark's report is the remarkable rise in the percentage of long-term holders. Now at an all-time high, 76% of Bitcoin's total available supply hasn't moved in more than 155 days, the point at which short-term holders change to long term.\n\nThis time frame might seem arbitrary, but analytics firm Glassnode has found it to be a statistically significant benchmark as those who hold past 155 days are more likely to be smart-money investors and can provide insight into market sentiment.\n\nArk's analysts point out that this trend of an increasing number of long-term holders aligns with other transitional periods in Bitcoin's history, suggesting that this bear market might not be fundamentally different from previous ones.\n\nTypically, long-term holders enter the market in droves and pick up coins on the cheap, creating an accumulation phase usually associated with post-bear markets and early stages of bull markets. Moreover, the increase in long-term holders further reduces the digital currency's already scarce supply, potentially setting the stage for a significant price surge should a bull market return.\n\nMetrics suggest oversold conditions\n\nArk's embrace of innovation and admiration for Bitcoin extends beyond just an anecdotal report. The firm also creates unique metrics and indicators to assess its current position relative to past cycles. The latest report highlighted two specific statistics supporting Ark's stance that the cryptocurrency is currently trading at a relative discount.\n\nThe profit/loss ratio, comparing the number of coins transacted at a profit to those at a loss, currently hovers just above 1, indicating a decline in investor \"exuberance\" compared to earlier in the year, when Bitcoin's price jumped more than 80% in just five months. When reaching these levels in the past, the crypto was either in the depths of a bear market or clawing its way back into a bull market. Ark sees it as the latter.\n\nArk highlighted another crucial metric, the realized-profits-to-realized-cap ratio, which is currently at its lowest point since the beginning of the year, further indicating oversold conditions. This ratio measures profit-taking among Bitcoin investors against its realized cap, rather than the more commonly used market cap. Since realized cap is calculated by multiplying the last price at which every Bitcoin was transacted instead of valuing every coin at its current price, it offers a more sensitive and less misleading assessment than market cap.\n\nBy quantifying the amount of realized profits against Bitcoin's realized cap, Ark is able to measure buying and selling activity more clearly. Considering Bitcoin has historically entered the oversold territory of this ratio only seven times in its history, today could be an opportune moment for investors.\n\nThe macroeconomic landscape: Challenges and optimism\n\nArk's report doesn't shy away from acknowledging current unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and the potential challenges they pose to Bitcoin's bull market return. The prolonged interest rate hikes and tighter liquidity anticipated in markets globally could present hurdles for cryptocurrencies since typically these assets have thrived in environments with liquidity surpluses.\n\nHowever, despite short-term challenges, Ark remains bullish on Bitcoin in the long run. Its analysis suggests that the cryptocurrency's resiliency and favorable developments of on-chain metrics such as the number of active owners and mining difficulty, put it in a potentially lucrative position as it navigates the fine line between bear and bull markets."

While the United States equities markets were a slow mover, gold witnessed a massive run-up of more than 5% this week. Its rally of 3.11% on Oct. 13 was its best one-day performance since Dec. 1 of last year. However, the Bitcoin (BTC) bulls did not have any such luck as Bitcoin is on track to end the week down more than 3%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s weakness and the regulatory overhang have kept crypto investors away from altcoins. That has kept Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance hovering near the 50% mark for the past few days.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nMarket observers are likely to keep their focus on Bitcoin for the next few days. The longer the bulls sustain the price above $25,000, the greater the possibility that the next move is likely to be higher. A bullish move in Bitcoin is likely to spur buying in select altcoins as crypto investors will then sense a bull market.\n\nSelect cryptocurrencies are showing signs of forming a base. If they breakout to the upside, a new up-move may start. Let\u2019s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that could outperform in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been trading between the moving averages for the past few days, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nUsually, a tight consolidation is followed by a range expansion. In this case, if buyers kick the price above the 20-day exponential moving average ($27,110), the BTC/USDT pair could rise to $28,143. The bears are expected to mount a strong defense at this level.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down and dives below the 50-day simple moving average ($26,671), it will signal that bears have asserted their supremacy. The pair may first drop to $25,990 and thereafter to the pivotal support at $24,800. This level is likely to attract aggressive buying by the bulls.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair\u2019s recovery is facing selling at the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart but a positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that the buyers are not rushing to the exit and are keeping up the pressure.\n\nIf the 20-EMA is taken out, the pair could first rise to the 50-SMA. This level may act as a minor barrier but if overcome, the pair could climb to $27,750 and then to $28,143.\n\nOn the contrary, if the bulls fail to pierce the 20-EMA, the sellers will sense an opportunity to pull the price lower. A dump below $26,500 could sink the pair to $26,000 and then to $24,800.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nSolana (SOL) has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the 20-day EMA ($21.77). This suggests that the bulls are trying to flip this level into support.\n\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThere is a minor resistance at $22.50 but if this level is crossed, the SOL/USDT pair could rise to the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern. A break and close above this resistance will complete the bullish setup. Buyers may face a stiff resistance at $27.12 but if this hurdle is cleared, the pair could surge to the target objective at $32.81.\n\nThis positive view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the 50-day SMA ($20.50). That could start a descent toward $18.58 and then to $15.33.\n\nAfter trading between the moving averages for some time, the price resolved to the downside with a break below the 20-EMA. This indicates that the bears may remain in control. The pair could first fall to $20.93 and if this level also cracks, the pair may collapse to $20.\n\nConversely, if the price fails to sustain below the 20-EMA, it will suggest solid buying at lower levels. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 50-SMA. That could open the doors for a rally to $23.50 and then to the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern.\n\nLido DAO price analysis\n\nLido DAO (LDO) has been trading near the moving averages for the past few days, indicating that the bears may be losing their grip.\n\nLDO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have flattened out and the RSI has jumped into the positive territory, indicating that the bulls are attempting a comeback. The immediate resistance on the upside is $1.73. If this level is scaled, the LDO/USDT pair could climb to the downtrend line. This level is again likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down and skids below the moving averages, it will suggest that the bears are in command and are selling on every minor rally. The pair may then retest the vital support at $1.38.\n\nThe 20-EMA has started to turn up on the 4-hour chart and the RSI is in the positive area, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. There is a minor resistance at $1.63 but it is likely to be crossed. The pair could then rise to $1.73.\n\nIf bears want to weaken the bullish momentum, they will have to quickly drag the price back below the moving averages. The pair could then slump to the $1.45 to $1.50 support zone.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin traders eye weekly close volatility with $27K BTC price on radar\n\nInternet Computer price analysis\n\nInternet Computer (ICP) has been consolidating in a tight range between $2.86 and $3.35 for the past several days.\n\nICP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe RSI has formed a positive divergence, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. The ICP/USDT pair could next reach the overhead resistance at $3.35. A break and close above this level will signal a potential trend change. The first target on the upside is $4 and then $4.50.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $3.35, it will suggest that the pair may extend its stay inside the range for some more time. A slide below $2.86 will indicate the resumption of the downtrend.\n\nICP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the overbought zone on the 4-hour chart. This indicates that the buyers have the upper hand. The pair is likely to reach the overhead resistance at $3.35 where the bears may to pose a strong challenge.\n\nIf the price turns down from $3.35, the consolidation may continue for a while longer. On the other hand, if buyers kick the price above $3.35, it will indicate that the bulls are in charge. The pair may then soar to $3.74 and later to the pattern target of $3.84.\n\nVeChain price analysis\n\nVeChain (VET) has been trading inside a descending triangle for the past few days. Although this is a negative pattern, the price has been clinging to the downtrend line for the past few days, which is a positive sign.\n\nVET/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating that the bearish pressure may be reducing. Buyers will try to propel the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, it will invalidate the negative setup. That could start a new up-move toward $0.021.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down from the current level, it will suggest that bears continue to defend the downtrend line with vigor. The bears will then again try to pull the price to the critical support at $0.014.\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the price has been trading inside the falling wedge pattern. Buyers are trying to push and sustain the price above the 50-SMA. If they do that, the VET/USDT pair could reach the downtrend line of the wedge. A break and close above the wedge could start a new up-move.\n\nThe bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will aggressively defend the zone between the 50-SMA and the downtrend line. If the price turns down sharply and slides below the 20-EMA, it will indicate that the pair may remain inside the wedge for some more time.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "This 1 Magic Number Will Tell You if a Bitcoin Mining Stock Is Worth Buying - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Throughout 2023, Bitcoin (BTC -2.89%) mining stocks have been soaring. For example, Riot Platforms (RIOT -7.33%) is up 180% for the year, while Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA -9.89%) is up an almost equally impressive 134%. The price of Bitcoin is up 60% during this period, so this strong market performance makes sense.\n\nBut there's more to analyzing Bitcoin mining stocks beyond just the price of Bitcoin. One magic number could be very helpful for investors in determining which mining stocks are worth buying.\n\nBitcoin production capacity\n\nIt might sound obvious, but Bitcoin miners make money by mining as much Bitcoin as they can. As long as the price of Bitcoin is increasing, this should be profitable. That's why 2023 has been such a banner year for Bitcoin mining stocks.\n\nThe focus in 2023 has been on overall Bitcoin production capacity. There are several ways to analyze production capacity. The easiest way is simply to look at how much Bitcoin has been mined each month. The largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners provide monthly production updates, and it's easy to see at a glance how much they've produced over any 30-day period.\n\nYou could also take a more nuanced view, and look at factors like the number of mining rigs in operation, as well as the number of mining rigs that are set to come on stream soon. Or you could look at a factor like hash rate, which measures the amount of computational power being used to mine Bitcoin.\n\nThe overall takeaway is clear: Bigger is better in 2023. Investing in Bitcoin mining stocks is relatively easy this year -- just find the company mining the most Bitcoin, and you're good to go.\n\nBitcoin operational efficiency\n\nHowever, this narrative around Bitcoin mining stocks could change in 2024 due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April. This event, which takes place only once every four years, is one of the most anticipated events in the crypto industry. With any halving event, the reward paid out to Bitcoin miners for mining a single block of Bitcoin drops by 50%.\n\nThis might sound like a highly technical event of interest only to blockchain enthusiasts, but it has massive repercussions for Bitcoin miners. Essentially, it means that, all things being equal, Bitcoin miners will earn half as much money doing the same amount of work. To put this into perspective: Imagine if your boss told you that your salary has been slashed by 50%, but that you're still expected to show up and do the same amount of work.\n\nThat's why we're starting to see warning signals from analysts. One term I've seen used is \"severe income stress,\" and I think that perfectly explains what's about to happen in 2024. According to analysts, production costs are going to double in 2024 due to the halving. Currently, the breakeven production cost for a single Bitcoin is approximately $15,000. As long as the price of Bitcoin stays above $15,000, Bitcoin miners should be profitable. However, in 2024, the average production cost for mining a single Bitcoin could increase to $30,000.\n\nIf you check out the current price of Bitcoin -- roughly $27,000 as of mid-October -- you can see why an average production cost of $30,000 is so worrisome. The average Bitcoin miner is not going to be making money next year unless the price of Bitcoin increases.\n\nThe magic number for Bitcoin miners\n\nThus, my magic number for evaluating Bitcoin miners is the average cost to produce a single Bitcoin. As an investor, I want this number to be as low as possible. I want to invest in a Bitcoin mining operation that is streamlined, efficient, and fully prepared to deal with \"severe income stress\" next year.\n\nThe one Bitcoin company I'm focused on right now is Riot Platforms, which is generally acknowledged to have the lowest Bitcoin production costs in the industry. In the second quarter of 2023, the average cost to produce a single Bitcoin was only $8,389. And that was actually a decline from the year-earlier period, when the average cost was $11,316. This tells me two things: Riot Platforms has a very efficient operation, and its operations are getting more efficient over time.\n\nGoing forward, the average Bitcoin production cost is what I'm using to evaluate Bitcoin miners. Yes, the absolute amount of Bitcoin they are producing is still important, but I want to make sure that these companies are making money on every coin they mine. Long story short, only the most cost-effective Bitcoin miners with the lowest production costs are going to survive in 2024. That's why I'm bullish on Bitcoin mining stocks that are best-in-class when it comes to operational efficiency."

        "title": "Up More Than 175%, Is Riot Platforms Still a Buy? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There's no disputing that Bitcoin (BTC -2.89%) miner Riot Platforms (RIOT -7.33%) has been one of the top-performing stocks of the year. Up more than 175% over the first nine months of 2023, Riot Platforms has benefited greatly from the surprising rally in Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, cracks are starting to appear in the Bitcoin miner investment thesis, and that is leading to downward pressure on the price of Riot Platforms. Over the past 30 days, Riot is actually down 10%, amid a broader sell-off in Bitcoin mining stocks on Wall Street. So is Riot Platforms still a buy?\n\nThe fundamentals still look good\n\nIf you take a look at the underlying fundamentals of Riot Platforms, there are no obvious red flags. The company recently released its latest Bitcoin production report for September, and everything looks good. The company mined 362 Bitcoins last month, up 9% from the previous month. At the same time, the company's deployed hash rate (which measures the computational power of its mining rigs) continues to rise on a month-over-month basis.\n\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, the company continues to improve its overall operational efficiency. Riot Platforms has long been acknowledged as one of the lowest-cost producers in the Bitcoin mining industry, and if anything, Riot is getting even better at streamlining its operations. In second-quarter 2023, Riot's average production cost for a single Bitcoin was $8,389. That's a 25% decrease from the previous year, when the cost was $11,316.\n\nCracks in the investment thesis\n\nHowever, with Bitcoin stalled out near the $30,000 price level, analysts and investors are taking a closer look at the long-term growth prospects for Bitcoin miners. These companies make money in a rising price environment for Bitcoin, so if the price of Bitcoin is going to continue to languish in the $25,000 to $30,000 range, then it might be time to reassess how much money Bitcoin miners are actually going to make over the next 12 months.\n\nThat's likely what led to a recent sell-off across the board in Bitcoin mining stocks. As a best-in-class mining stock, Riot fell less than rivals, but the pain was definitely palpable. Riot took a 17.8% haircut in September, and is now trading for under $10.\n\nIn October, the changing environment for mining stocks eventually led to JPMorgan Chase (JPM -1.33%) putting out an \"Underweight\" rating for Riot Platforms. According to JPMorgan Chase, hash rate increases across the industry are leading to a \"crucible moment\" and intense competitive pressures for Riot. Put another way, the entire industry has their Bitcoin mining rigs cranked to 11 as they attempt to produce as much Bitcoin as possible, and that's making things difficult for Riot.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving\n\nThe final factor to consider is the upcoming Bitcoin halving, now scheduled for April 2024. This event takes place only once every four years, and will be one of the most anticipated events of the year for the crypto industry. In three previous halving cycles, the price of Bitcoin has rallied, and many Bitcoin bulls are expecting the same to happen in 2024.\n\nOn the surface, the Bitcoin halving seems to be a bullish factor for Bitcoin miners. If the price of Bitcoin rallies after the halving, shouldn't Bitcoin miners make even more money from every single Bitcoin they mine?\n\nWell, yes and no. The problem is that the halving also reduces the mining reward for each new block of Bitcoin by one-half. So, all things being equal, the price of Bitcoin would have to double in order to make up for the lower mining rewards. This new dynamic could lead to severe repercussions for every Bitcoin miner.\n\nMoreover, investors need to keep in mind that the Bitcoin halving will also lead to increased production costs. After all, running massive facilities of energy-intensive Bitcoin mining rigs on maximum power is not cheap. The conventional thinking now is that production costs are going to double in 2024, from $15,000 per Bitcoin to $30,000 per Bitcoin. That's going to cause extreme duress for any Bitcoin miner that doesn't have costs under control.\n\nWhy not just buy Bitcoin?\n\nThe important point to keep in mind is that Bitcoin mining stocks are highly cyclical in nature. So it's completely unrealistic for investors to assume that even a low-cost producer like Riot can continue to churn out triple-digit returns, year in and year out. As we get closer and closer to the Bitcoin halving, this is going to become increasingly evident.\n\nIf you're a long-term investor, it might just be easier to invest in Bitcoin rather than Bitcoin mining stocks. You can still participate in the upside of crypto without worrying about picking a winner in the Bitcoin mining industry. As we head into 2024, I'm still bullish on Bitcoin, but less so on Bitcoin mining stocks."

        "content": "Satslink looks similar to the Coldcard Q1, but internally it's completely different. Coinkite\n\nCoinkite has announced their latest product, Satslink. The under-production device sits at the intersection of many different areas of communications and mobile hardware, empowering developers to build a whole slew of different applications.\n\nRather than leaning on an opinionated framework, Satslink leverages open and flexible hardware enclosed by the Coldcard Q1\u2019s exterior to bring variety and flexibility to developers. Those in possession of this device can choose what to do with it, and let their builder mentalities run wild on the many different possibilities the piece of hardware can offer.\n\nAt its core, Satslink is a peer-to-peer, hackable multi-purpose device. It features a secure element, as typical of Coinkite products, allowing the user to securely store private keys within the device. While it shares the external design with the Coldcard Q1, the internals are totally different from the company\u2019s latest hardware wallet. Instead of focusing on air gapped security, the Satslink aims to bring secure communications to the day to day in ways that few would\u2019ve considered possible.\n\n\u201cBeing dissatisfied with the connected and DIY options, we felt the need to create a better hot platform,\u201d NVK, founder at Coinkite, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBitcoin is expanding scripting/mpc options and we now have Nostr. Someone had to make a good connected and portable device for developers and enthusiast to create the next generation of freedom functionality.\u201d\n\nSatslink leverages ESP32-S3, a low-power MCU-based system on a chip (SoC) with integrated 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE). It consists of high-performance dual-core microprocessor (Xtensa\u00ae 32-bit LX7), a low power coprocessor, a Wi-Fi baseband, a Bluetooth LE baseband, RF module, and numerous peripherals. Satslink is programmed in micropython, with its source fully-available, and it is completely field upgradable with no locked-down ROM areas. Coinkite\u2019s product also features a MicroSD slot for data transfer.\n\nSatslink seems to join together many different fields in bitcoin, technology and communications. Coinkite\n\n\u201cThe initial target is developers and enthusiasts,\u201d NVK said. \u201cBut, because of the consumer friendly form factor, they will be able to start using anything the community creates. Like hot and sovereign lightning wallets and Nostr clients!\u201d\n\nNostr, the open communications protocol that went viral after Block CEO and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey started endorsing and funding the project, is top of the list of possible use cases for Satslink. Given its peer-to-peer communication capabilities, Satslink can be used as a Nostr client, and since it can also work as a relay, one could send and receive messages as Nostr posts without those ever hitting the internet. Imagine a localized Nostr made up of many Satslink devices talking to each other through a sort of mesh network instead of the open web. That could be possible with this device.\n\nAnother interesting use case that many bitcoiners could relate to is having a sovereign controller for their home-based bitcoin stack. As some bitcoiners run bitcoin nodes and sometimes even self-hosted servers at home, one could program the Satslink to connect to their home stack on demand and perform desired actions remotely and securely given its networking capabilities. Satslink could be used to run a transaction coordinator, for instance, or be used as a whole wallet \u2013\u2013 though Coinkite doesn\u2019t recommend using the Satslink as your go-to cold storage solution for large bitcoin amounts.\n\nSatslink\u2019s communication features also boast NFC and a QR code reader, enabling even more use cases for its eventual users. Notably, this combination paired with Satslink\u2019s versatility and programmability could even be used to turn it into a hardware wallet of another manufacturer. Whether that\u2019s desirable or not, truth is it could be possible to turn a Satslink into Blockstream\u2019s JADE wallet or other similar DIY hardware wallets.\n\nWhile the possibilities are endless, what users actually build with this product remains to be seen. Coinkite\u2019s device is currently available to preorder on the company\u2019s website at a $189 price tag, and it is still unclear when the product will start shipping to buyers."

        "content": "Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses Offering College Course Website Indian School of Business ISB Professional Certificate in Product Management Visit MIT MIT Technology Leadership and Innovation Visit IIT Delhi IITD Certificate Programme in Data Science & Machine Learning Visit\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will not appeal a recent court ruling that found it was wrong to reject an application from Grayscale Investments to create a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund ( ETF ), said a source familiar with the matter.The District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Washington in August ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale's proposed bitcoin ETF, in a case that has been closely watched by the industry which has been trying for a decade to advance such products.The SEC's decision not to appeal likely paves the way for the agency to review Grayscale's application.A spokeswoman for Grayscale did not immediately provide comment.A spot bitcoin ETF would give investors exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization without having to own it. The SEC has denied all spot bitcoin ETF applications, including Grayscale's, on the grounds applicants have not shown they can protect investors from market manipulation.Grayscale sued the SEC, arguing that because the agency previously approved certain surveillance agreements to prevent fraud in bitcoin futures-based ETFs the same setup should be satisfactory for Grayscale's spot ETF, since both spot and futures funds rely on bitcoin's price.The appeals court ruled that the SEC arbitrarily denied Grayscale's application because it never explained why the two arrangements were materially different.The appeals court is expected to issue a mandate specifying how its decision should be executed, which will likely include instructing the SEC to revisit Grayscale's application.Several other asset managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco, have similar filings pending with the SEC for a spot bitcoin ETF. The SEC is due to decide on those applications by next year at the latest.The SEC's press office did not immediately provide comment."

        "title": "Across US, Chinese Bitcoin mines draw national security scrutiny - The Business Times",
        "content": "WHEN a company with Chinese origins broke ground last year on a crypto-mining operation in Cheyenne, Wyoming, a team at Microsoft that assesses national security threats sounded the alarm.\n\nNot only was the site next door to a Microsoft data center that supported the Pentagon, but it was also about 1 mile away from an Air Force base that controlled nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nThe location could allow the Chinese to \u201cpursue full-spectrum intelligence collection operations,\u201d the Microsoft team wrote in an August 2022 report to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a federal body that monitors threats posed by overseas investors.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s warning did not go unheeded. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, US government officials told The New York Times last week that they had been tracking the Wyoming operation for months. One official said that measures had been taken to mitigate potential intelligence collection but declined to elaborate. In addition, the mining company said it responded to queries from the federal investment committee.\n\nThe national security concerns about the Wyoming site, previously unreported, reflect a broader unease about a recent surge in Chinese bitcoin mines across the country.\n\nAside from intelligence-gathering worries, the mines, which are large warehouses or containers packed with specialized computers, put immense pressure on power grids. The computers typically run around the clock while \u201cmining\u201d for the digital coins, the most popular among the various cryptocurrencies.\n\nSEE ALSO Hong Kong issues new national security law bill with tougher jail terms\n\nGET BT IN YOUR INBOX DAILY Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. Sign Up VIEW ALL\n\nBrian Harrell, a former assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at the Department of Homeland Security during the Trump administration, said the operations could place \u201cenormous stress\u201d on the grid if the mines worked in concert to wreak havoc.\n\nPossibilities include targeted blackouts and cyberattacks.\n\nIn at least 12 states \u2013 including Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming \u2013 the Times identified Chinese-owned or Chinese-operated bitcoin mines that together use as much energy as 1.5 million homes. At full capacity, the Cheyenne mine would require enough electricity to power 55,000 houses.\n\nMany of the mines are equipped with computers made by Bitmain, a Chinese company that has no apparent direct connection to Chinese authorities but, according to import records, has sent some shipments to the United States through a subsidiary located at a Communist Party site in southern China.\n\nSince bitcoin mining was banned in China in May 2021 over concerns about energy usage and economic destabilization, Bitmain has shipped 15 times more equipment to the United States than it did in the previous five years combined, the records show. A recent presentation by the company claimed it controlled 90 per cent of the global market for the equipment.\n\nSome of the US mining operations appear to be straightforward efforts by wealthy Chinese nationals to make money outside the purview of Chinese authorities. For others, the ownership is opaque, while several can be traced to the Chinese government.\n\nCourt documents show that the mine in Cheyenne is linked to five companies, all using the same office on Park Avenue in New York City. One of them is registered in the Cayman Islands and until last year was a Chinese pork-processing company. The Times did not find any links between the owners of the Cheyenne mine and the Chinese government or Communist Party.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft has no direct indications of malicious activities by this entity,\u201d Microsoft said in its 16-page report. \u201cHowever, pending further discovery, we suggest the possibility that the computing power of an industrial-level crypto-mining operation, along with the presence of an unidentified number of Chinese nationals in direct proximity to Microsoft\u2019s Data Center and one of three strategic-missile bases in the US, provides significant threat vectors.\u201d\n\nThe new risks come amid a steep rise in bitcoin mining in the US. This year, a Times investigation found that operations were consuming about 4,000 megawatts \u2013 enough to power more than 3 million US households \u2013 and that more megawatts were continuously coming online.\n\nThe operations\u2019 vast energy consumption, combined with their ability to turn on or off almost instantly, is unique among large power users. The combination allows many to participate in programs that pay them to shut down when a grid is under strain.\n\nThat flexibility can help keep the lights on, but it can also disrupt the delicate balance grids require.\n\nMany mines also have digital connections with grid operators that could allow intrusions into critical systems.\n\nIn July, an official with the North American Electric Reliability, which oversees protection of the power grid, told Congress about the growing threat of Chinese cyberattacks.\n\nThe Chertoff Group, a prominent security advisory firm, has been approached by several \u201ccritical infrastructure providers\u201d for advice about the risks posed by bitcoin miners, particularly those owned by the Chinese, said Ben Joelson, one of the firm\u2019s security experts.\n\nIn many parts of the country, the frustration is palpable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all worked up over TikTok, but nobody seems to be saying anything about these Chinese companies connecting to our grids,\u201d said Bryan King, a Republican state senator in Arkansas whose district includes the city of Harrison, where a Chinese investment group has purchased land for a bitcoin mine. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nThe influx of mining in Texas has already begun to affect the state grid, one of the most vulnerable in the country because it is unconnected to others outside the state.\n\nThe grid\u2019s operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, recently reported that bitcoin mines\u2019 energy consumption and lack of transparency had resulted in forecasting errors. The mines can \u201cmagnify the severity of grid events,\u201d impacting reliability, the company said.\n\nOne proposal to reduce this risk is to regulate how fast the mines can start or stop using energy.\n\nChinese cryptocurrency mines have quickly entrenched themselves in Texas and are learning to adapt to its politics.\n\nOne company, Poolin, set up by a Bitmain veteran, runs a pair of mines in West Texas that together can draw on as much as 600 megawatts of energy, enough to power nearly 500,000 US homes. The company\u2019s founder, Kevin Pan, is a Chinese citizen who has celebrated the warm embrace he and his company have received in Texas.\n\nAt a company celebration last year, he was seen wearing a cowboy hat and challenging guests to a one-armed pushup contest.\n\n\u201cI feel so lucky we chose Texas,\u201d Pan said. \u201cWe chose America.\u201d NYTIMES"
