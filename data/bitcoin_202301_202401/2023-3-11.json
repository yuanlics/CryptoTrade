        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For once, the crisis didn\u2019t seem to revolve around a cryptocurrency company.\n\nThe sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday set off panic across the technology industry. But crypto executives and investors \u2014 who have endured a year of near-constant upheaval \u2014 seized on the moment to preach and scold.\n\nCentralized banking was to blame, the crypto advocates said. Their vision of an alternate financial system, unmoored from big banks and other gatekeepers, was better. They argued that the government regulators that recently cracked down on crypto firms had sown the seeds of the bank\u2019s implosion.\n\n\u201cFiat is fragile,\u201d wrote the Bitcoin advocate Erik Voorhees, using a common shorthand for traditional currencies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing glitches in the machine,\u201d said Mo Shaikh, chief executive of the crypto company Aptos Labs. \u201cThis is an opportunity to take a breath and consider the practicalities of decentralization.\u201d"

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price remains bullish, up almost 60% since mid-September, confirming the \u201cQ4 is the best month for BTC\u201d narrative.\n\nBTC could extend to tag the $40,000 psychological level before a bigger dip to give late and sidelined investors buy opportunity.\n\nWith strong downward support, GIOM shows there is one major area of interest between $42,556 to $67,413 threatening upside potential.\n\nInvalidation of the bullish thesis will occur the king of crypto breaks and closes below the $37,500 resistance level.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is trading with a bullish bias, riding on three themes. First, the fourth quarter has historically proven to be a good month for BTC. Secondly, there is strong anticipation for the approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with experts marking the calendar for between January 5 and 10. Third, the Bitcoin halving event slated for April 2024 remains something to look forward to.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price rally to $45,000 likely ahead of fourth BTC halving event\n\nBitcoin price could scrape $40,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is eyeing the $40,000 psychological level and could scrape it before a correction. Several bullish drivers, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI), bolster this outlook. For the RSI, this momentum indicator shows momentum is rising, with its position at 68 showing there is still more room to the north before the king of cryptocurrency can be considered overbought.\n\nFurther, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is in the positive territory, with green histogram bars, suggesting the bulls are leading the market. Increased buying pressure, therefore, could see Bitcoin price extend from the current price of $39,462 (as of 8:00 AM GMT), and clear the $39,778 range high before scrapping the $40,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn-chain metrics to support Bitcoin bullish outlook\n\nOn-chain aggregator IntoTheBlock\u2019s Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) metric shows there is no supply barrier that will prevent the largest crypto by market cap from achieving its upside potential. Based on this on-chain metric, there is only one major area of interest between $38,670 and $39,701 that is filled by a high number of investors that had previously purchased BTC around this price level. Here, roughly 860,540 addresses are holding nearly 324,370 BTC tokens.\n\nThe next crucial resistance extends from $42,556 to $67,413 where 5.64 million addresses or investors had previously purchased 2.11 million BTC tokens at an average price of $52,282.\n\nThe representation also shows that at current prices, 85.60% of BTC holders are sitting on unrealized profit (in the money) while only 12.74% are sitting on unrealized losses (out of the money). Meanwhile, a negligible 1.66% of token holders are breaking even (at the money).\n\nGIOM BTC\n\nAlso, the exchange inflows metric shows a declining trend, meaning the overall intention among token holders to sell BTC is reducing even as more continue to sit on unrealized profits. It points to a commitment to riding the uptrend, effectively giving Bitcoin price an abundance of buying pressure over seller momentum.\n\nBTC exchange inflows\n\nOn the flip side, if profit-taking begins, with traders cashing in for quick gains, Bitcoin price could move south, with key levels to watch, including $37,500, $35,000, $32,500, $31,529, and in the dire case, the $30,000 psychological level. Such a move would constitute a 25% drop from current levels."

        "title": "What the failures of Signature, SVB and Silvergate mean for the crypto sector - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nTwo of the banks that were friendliest to the crypto sector and the biggest bank for tech startups all failed in less than a week. While cryptocurrency prices rallied Sunday night after the federal government stepped in to provide a backstop for depositors in two of the banks, the events sparked instability in the stablecoin market. Silvergate Capital, a central lender to the crypto industry, said on Wednesday that it would be winding down operations and liquidating its bank. Silicon Valley Bank, a major lender to startups, collapsed on Friday after depositors withdrew more than $42 billion following the bank's Wednesday statement that it needed to raise $2.25 billion to shore up its balance sheet. Signature, which also had a strong crypto focus but was much larger than Silvergate, was seized on Sunday evening by banking regulators. Signature and Silvergate were the two main banks for crypto companies, and nearly half of all U.S. venture-backed startups kept cash with Silicon Valley Bank, including crypto-friendly venture capital funds and some digital asset firms. The federal government stepped in on Sunday to guarantee all deposits for SVB and Signature depositors, adding confidence and sparking a small rally in the crypto markets. Both bitcoin and ether are nearly 10% higher in the last 24 hours. According to Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures, the government's willingness to backstop both banks signifies that it's back in the mode of providing liquidity, rather than tightening, and loose monetary policy has historically proven to be a boon for cryptocurrencies and other speculative asset classes. But the instability once again showed the vulnerability of stablecoins, a subset of the crypto ecosystem investors can typically rely on to maintain a set price. Stablecoins are supposed to be pegged to the value of a real-world asset, such as a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar or a commodity like gold. But unusual financial conditions can cause them to drop below their pegged value.\n\nA lot of crypto's problems in the last year originated in the stablecoin sector, beginning with TerraUSD's collapse last May. Meanwhile, regulators have been homing in on stablecoins in the last few weeks. Binance's dollar-pegged stablecoin, BUSD, saw massive outflows after New York regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission applied pressure on its issuer, Paxos. Over the weekend, confidence in this sector again took a hit as USDC \u2013 the second-most liquid U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin \u2013 lost its peg, dropping below 87 cents at one point on Saturday after its issuer, Circle, admitted to having $3.3 billion banked with SVB. Within the digital assets ecosystem, Circle has long been regarded as one of the adults in the room, boasting close connections and backing from the world of traditional finance. It raised $850 million from investors like BlackRock and Fidelity and had long said it planned to go public. DAI, another popular dollar-pegged virtual currency that is partially backed by USDC, traded as low as 90 cents on Saturday. Both Coinbase and Binance temporarily paused USDC-to-dollar conversions. On Saturday, some traders began swapping their USDC and DAI for tether, the world's biggest stablecoin with a market value of more than $72 billion. Tether's issuing company did not have any exposure to SVB and it's currently trading above its $1 peg as traders flock to safer pastures, even though tether's business practices have been called into question, as have the state of its reserves. The stablecoin market began to rebound as of Sunday evening after Circle released a blog post saying that it would \"cover any shortfall using corporate resources.\" Both USDC and DAI have since shifted back toward their dollar peg. Now that it is clear that SVB depositors will be made whole, Carter tells CNBC that he expects USDC to trade at par.\n\n'The two most bitcoin-friendly banks'\n\nIn the long run, the shutdown of the crypto banking trifecta could present problems for bitcoin , the world's largest cryptocurrency, with a market value of $422 billion. The Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) and Signature's Signet were real-time payment platforms that crypto customers considered core offerings. Both allowed commercial clients to make payments 24 hours a day, seven days a week, through their respective instant settlement services. \"Bitcoin liquidity and crypto liquidity overall will be somewhat impaired because Signet and SEN were key for firms to get fiat in on the weekend,\" said Carter, who added that he is hopeful that customer banks will step in to fill the void left by SEN and Signet. \"These were the two most bitcoin-friendly banks, supporting the lion's share of fiat settlement for bitcoin trades between trading counterparties in the U.S.,\" wrote Mike Brock in a post on Nostr. Brock is the CEO of TBD at Block, a unit which focuses on cryptocurrency and decentralized finance. Although Carter thinks the Fed stepping in to guarantee depositors of SVB will prevent a larger bank run on Monday, he says it is still dispiriting to see the three largest crypto-friendly banks taken offline in a matter of days. \"There are very few options now for crypto firms and the industry will be strapped for liquidity until new banks step in,\" said Carter. Mike Bucella, a longtime investor and executive in the crypto space, says that many in the industry are pivoting to Mercury and Axos, two other banks that cater to startups. Meanwhile, Circle has already publicly said that it is shifting is assets to BNY Mellon now that Signature bank is closing. \"Near-term, crypto banking in North America is a tough place,\" said Bucella. \"However there is a long tail of challenger banks that may take up that slack.\""

        "content": "Yuga Labs, a popular NFTs creator, has been in the headlines after announcing that they made over $16 million (735.7 bitcoin) from the auction of 300 bitcoin NFTs in the TwelveFold collection.\n\nTwelveFold, whose auction is now complete, is described as a limited edition, experimental collection of 300 generative art pieces inscribed onto Satoshis on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\u201cThese pieces represent a complete art project and will not have other utility or interact with or be related to any previous, ongoing, or future Ethereum-based Yuga projects.\u201d \u2013 TwelveFold.\n\nOrdinal inscriptions, sometimes referred to as just inscriptions, or just ordinals, are NFTs you can mint directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain and that live on the network. An inscription is created when a file, such as an art image, is written into (inscribed into) units of Bitcoin, called Satoshis.\n\nSatoshis are the smallest individually identifiable units of Bitcoin (100 million Satoshis equals one Bitcoin). Inscriptions, also called digital artifacts, are native to the Bitcoin blockchain and are made possible through the Ordinal Theory Protocol.\n\nOrdinals\n\nThe concept of Bitcoin Ordinals was first proposed in a whitepaper by a team of researchers led by Tadge Dryja in 2019. The idea is to create a new type of transaction that allows users to encode arbitrary data into the Bitcoin blockchain, including metadata related to NFTs. This metadata can include information such as ownership provenance and other attributes that are important for NFTs.\n\nHowever, inscribing bitcoin only became possible thanks to the Taproot upgrade which launched on the Bitcoin network on November 2021 while the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol was only launched in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are a way of encoding arbitrary data into Bitcoin transactions, making it possible to store metadata related to NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. This metadata includes information such as ownership, provenance, and other attributes that are important for NFTs.\n\nThe Taproot upgrade makes Ordinals possible by:\n\nReducing the costs of data storage on the Bitcoin blockchain by 75%\n\nAddressing the scability problem by reducing the amount of data needed to process each transaction\n\nThe introduction of the \u2018MAST\u2019 transaction enables the creation of more complex and flexible smart contracts\n\nImproving the privacy of the network by allow users to hide the details of their transactions from the public\n\nIn order to inscribe an Ordinal however, users are required to run a full Bitcoin node.\n\nOrdinal inscriptions are seen as an improvement to Ethereum NFTs since all metadata is stored off-chain on Ethereum often on the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) \u2013 a decentralized file storage, sort of like a blockchain hard drive.\n\nOrdinals essentially enable you to inscribe \u2018complete\u2019 data on-chain, hence the term digital artifacts, according to Rodarmor.\n\nThe emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals has caused a significant surge in the usage, fees, and storage space of the Bitcoin Network, as depicted in the chart above. It also represents a major breakthrough for the Bitcoin application tier and can shift the narrative from being solely a \u2018store of value\u2019 to more practical use cases.\n\nIf you are interested in buying, selling or trading ordinals, follow these steps:\n\nGo to ordinalswallet.com\n\nClick on \u2018Create Wallet\u2019\n\nTake a backup of the recovery phrase for your wallet\n\nSet up a password for wallet access\n\nUse the address of the Ordinals Wallet to send some Sats to the wallet\n\nGo to \u2018Collections\u2019 at the top of the page\n\nChoose the ordinals collection and the inscription that you would like to buy\n\nBuy the ordinal (using the Sats in your wallet)\n\nAnother notable project in addition to TwelveFold is the Ordinal Punks, which pays homage to CryptoPunks with a set of 100 Bitcoin NFTs inscriptions on the Bitcoin chain.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFollow us on Twitter for latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n_____________________________________\n\n_____________________________________"

Discover SCENE\n\nA solo Bitcoin miner was rewarded for adding block 780,112 to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, beating the odds as countless others raced toward the same goal.\n\nThe miner used the Solo CK Pool mining service to establish a solo mining pool, where they produced a valid hash for the block and received a reward of 6.25 BTC and a fee reward of around 0.63 BTC\u2014worth about $148,000\u2014according to BTC.com\u2019s Bitcoin explorer.\n\nA Twitter user pointed out how lucky the solo miner was to produce the valid hash, saying it would typically take a miner much longer to create a valid transaction given the limited computing power they used.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA miner of this size will solve a block on average about once every 10 months,\u201d Twitter user @ckpooldev stated. \u201cThey've only been mining solo for the last 2 days so has been very lucky.\u201d\n\nCongratulations to miner39nDQ9BexEBXpRdkHY1z95CaMDEwh6muPW who solved the 270th solo block at https://t.co/UWgBvLkDqc with 6.7PH but doesn't appear to have been mining for very long https://t.co/WGVBC3QajX \u2014 Dr. Con Kolivas (@ckpooldev) March 10, 2023\n\nThe miner worked with an average hashing power of 6.7 PH/s (petahashes per second), according to @ckpooldev. Around the time that the block was added, Bitcoin\u2019s total hash rate was around 308,262 PH/s, meaning the solo miner\u2019s 6.7 PH/s hash rate represented roughly 0.002% of the blockchain\u2019s entire computational power.\n\nAn account on the Bitcoin forum bitcointalk.org stepped forward to claim responsibility for producing the valid hash, saying he rented extra power for less than a day using a service called nicehash.\n\n\u201cIndeed, it is a great luck to catch a block with such a hashrate,\u201d the user titled Pineconeeee stated on the forum. \u201cIn less than a day, luck smiled on me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe solo miner, who said they are from Russia, explained that they typically use a computing power of around 270 TH/s (terahashes per second) but rented 5 PH/s (petahashes per second) worth of power last Thursday, according to his post.\n\nThe block mined by the solo miner contained 3,220 transactions that consisted of around 16,940 worth of Bitcoin volume.\n\nIn order to add a block to a proof-of-work network like Bitcoin, miners continuously run calculations to discover a valid hash for the block, using a process akin to computational brute force.\n\nThese days, a majority of new blocks that are added to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain are mined via mining pools, where miners pool together their computing power to increase their chances of creating a valid hash.\n\nTechnically, it\u2019s possible for a Bitcoin miner to get lucky every now and then and produce a valid hash on their own, despite the competition of other computers racing to calculate a valid hash for the next block on Bitcoin\u2019s network.\n\nAccording to BTC.com, the largest mining pool in the world is currently Foundry USA, a mining pool that comprises around 34% of the total hashrate on Bitcoin's network over the past day. The mining pool\u2019s hashrate is around 107 EH/s (exahashes per second)\u2014around 15,970 times more powerful than the solo miner."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this week, the global cryptocurrency market experienced a decline as most digital assets saw a decrease in value due to various factors. Bitcoin , which began trading at the US$22,000 level on Monday, dropped to its lowest point since January 2021, reaching US$19,000. Similarly, Ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency, also experienced a drop, falling to the US$1,300 level. As a result, both of these cryptocurrencies experienced significant losses in their weekly gains.However, following the release of the US jobs data on Friday, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies experienced a rebound, as the US added 311,000 jobs in February, surpassing predictions. Over the past 24 hours, both Bitcoin and Ethereum gained 3%.Investors and traders reacted to the recent statement by US Fed Chair Jerome Powell regarding potential interest rate hikes, resulting in sell-offs and increased concerns over aggressive interest rate policies. However, the decline in the crypto market may also be attributed to uncertainties surrounding Silvergate Bank broadly this week.In November, the bank faced significant withdrawals of $8.1 billion from investors following the FTX incident, leading to a chain reaction of negative consequences, including the sale of debt at a loss of $718 million. The bank's latest financial report showed staggering losses of $1 billion for Q4 and $949 million for the entire year of 2022, in contrast to the $76 million profit recorded in 2021. The bank's announcement of liquidation this week has also significantly impacted the crypto market.On the other hand, during early trading, the stock of Signature Bank (SBNY) experienced a decline of up to 30% due to the impact of Silvergate Bank's collapse on the wider banking industry. Nevertheless, SBNY is recovering from this sudden drop in a volatile market, and now its decline has been reduced to 22%.In an interesting turn of events, according to reports, Amazon is set to launch its own NFT marketplace next month. The marketplace will reportedly be accessible as a tab on Amazon's main website, under the name \"Amazon Digital Marketplace\".Meanwhile, the highly anticipated Shanghai hard fork update for the Ethereum blockchain has been delayed by approximately two weeks. Originally slated for a late March launch, it is now expected to be implemented in early April.The Ethereum network has recently introduced a new feature called account abstraction, which will assist users in recovering their cryptocurrencies in the event that they lose their wallet's private keys. This is just one of several upgrades to the ETH network.Regarding the price action, here is an overview of the best and worst-performing cryptocurrencies among the top 100 by market capitalization during the previous week:Top 5 crypto gainers during the week:1. Kava is up by 18%2. Bone ShibaSwap is up by 8%3. PAX Gold is up by 2%4. UNUS SED LEO is up by 1%5. KuCoin Token is up by 0.53%Top 5 crypto losers this week:1. Dash is down by 28%2. SingularityNET is down by 27%3. Stacks is down by 26%4. Frax Share is down by 25%5. Mina is down by 25%(The author, Edul Patel, is CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex , a global crypto investing platform)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "Inscription mints via Bitcoin Ordinals reached a daily ATH.\n\nThe BRC-20 experiment has been deployed but users may need to be careful with minting in mass numbers.\n\nQuite a number of people cast doubts over the long-term relevance of Bitcoin [BTC] Ordinals after it launched in January.\n\nThe reason for this was because of the projection that miners would hesitate to work on NFTs within the Bitcoin network. But the recent landmark hit on 9 March, might have put an abrupt end to the skepticism.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nBRC-20: The spear opposing the doubting Thomases\n\nAccording to Dune Analytics, the number of Ordinals Inscriptions minted on the aforementioned data hit an All-Time High (ATH) of 31.692. The new frontier on the Bitcoin blockchain now has 392, 495 Inscriptions since inception.\n\nThese digital assets range from texts, audio, and applications to images. However, Inscriptions was able to reach the milestone mostly because of the text carving dominance.\n\nThis was because the information from the public blockchain tracker revealed that others were far off from reaching the share text Inscriptions gained.\n\nMoreso, most of the Inscriptions appeared after the BRC-20 execution. The BRC-20 offers a way for Ordinals users to mint and transfer their assets within the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThis hike meant that the BRC-20 chain on which the NFTs minting takes place has appreciated in user count. Although still in the experimental stage, the BRC-20 is a reflection of the Ethereum [ETH] ERC-20 standard.\n\nAdditionally, the rise in adoption could be linked to the public revelation of how to go about minting Ordinals and creating fungible assets on the blockchain.\n\nThere have been 23,926 BRC-20 ordinal inscriptions in the past 24 hours. It only took 6 weeks for people to figure out how to use ordinals to make fungible meme coins. At this point, nothing surprises me. pic.twitter.com/CnHD3qRTcA \u2014 Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) March 9, 2023\n\nHowever, there is a little misconception between Bitcoin Ordinals and Inscriptions. While Inscriptions are metadata that store transactions ran on Bitcoin nodes Ordinals are, however, tiny bits of Bitcoin called satoshis which users can use to apply different rarity traits to individual inscriptions.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Ordinals fees generated have risen up to 75.29 BTC. Despite the increase, the overtime size usage had decreased.\n\nIs the race to $5 billion still intact?\n\nBefore the milestone, Galaxy Research had developed a whitepaper with details of the Bitcoin Inscriptions. The 3 March analysis from the crypto insight platform noted that the Bitcoin NFTs operate very differently from the collections on the Ethereum blockchain\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s BTC\u2019s market cap in ETH\u2019s terms\n\nDefending its position on a possible $5 billion market valuation in the future, the research paper read,\n\n\u201cFrom a custody standpoint, inscriptions may actually be better than Ethereum NFTs, at least for institutional investors.\u201d\n\nDespite the success achieved, the BRC-20 developer advised that participants remain cautious and also avoid mass minting."

        "title": "Management Software Can Help Bitcoin Miners Realize Their Energy Potential - Nasdaq",
        "content": "With effective management software, bitcoin miners can take full advantage of the industry\u2019s unique efficiencies and potential profits.\n\nThis is an opinion editorial by Mitch Klee, an analyst at the mining management platform Foreman.\n\nAfter China banned bitcoin mining in May 2021, nearly 75% of global hash rate was dispersed and relocated to other countries such as Kazakhstan, Russia, the United States and Canada. Since the seemingly-devastating mining ban took hold in the mining hotbed of China almost two years ago, the landscape of Bitcoin mining has dramatically changed. Remarkably, hash rate has continued to grow and currently stands at around 320 exahashes per second (EH/s), with the U.S. alone estimated to account for almost 37% of all hashrate.\n\nThis hypercompetitive growth has prompted miners to seek more efficient ways to manage their operations at scale, with miner management software being a vital part of their strategy.\n\nUtilizing Bitcoin Mining Management Software\n\nManagement software is changing the landscape of Bitcoin mining by allowing mining facilities to manage their site effectively while saving costs and responding to energy grid demand.\n\nMiner management software is a way to organize and coordinate miners at scale. Starting up, configuring, and programming each ASIC is daunting, involving multiple steps such as establishing pool connections, completing firmware updates, managing power control, and diagnosing problematic hash boards. This setup process can be incredibly difficult when not using the right software. However, with effective miner management software, users can effortlessly manage their mines, ensuring optimal performance and productivity.\n\nThe programmable nature of this software empowers users to take control of various processes through conditional statements. For instance, if ASIC temperature reaches a certain threshold, it can activate sleep mode, or if the electricity price exceeds a certain threshold, it can curtail mining operations. The dynamic nature of the software allows users to control exactly how they'd like to set up their mine. Moreover, the dynamic nature of the miner software unlocks powerful capabilities such as managing the power grid and initiating demand response, providing users with a comprehensive solution for optimizing their mining operations.\n\nThe Importance Of Demand Response\n\nDemand response is the act of power consumers reacting to an increase in demand for a set amount of electricity on the grid. In a previous article, I expanded on Bitcoin miners' unique leverage through Demand response, which I recommend reading to learn more about how this relationship functions. In short, Bitcoin miners can respond more quickly to grid signals and at a larger scale than any other industry consumer can, without significantly hindering their profit margins.\n\nMining sites percolate across global energy markets, both on-grid and off-grid, finding any and all energy arbitrage opportunities. Similar to the properties of water, Bitcoin miners will follow and flow into the lowest-cost energy sources, consuming excess energy when needed. The flip side is that miner management software allows miners to respond to an increase in demand instantaneously, lowering the operating expenses and increasing the bottom line. This flexibility enabled by the software allows miners to optimize their operations continually, participate in unique grid service programs, and stay ahead of the competition.\n\nOne example is the strike price. When production costs exceed revenue, miners should shut off and management software enables this automatic trigger.\n\nMiner management software allows users to automatically and programmatically respond to high demand for electricity through the strike price mechanism. Couple that with demand response programs, and miners are now lowering their overall costs and getting paid to shut down by utility company demand-response programs.\n\nThis programmatic response to increased demand adds an operating system to the century-old grid, with large flexible loads responding in real-time at scale. Spread this out to grids worldwide, and Bitcoin mining has just created an equilibrium-responding mechanism to keep the grid balance in check. By funding excess production, can keep the lights on at scale while lowering overall grid electricity costs.\n\nOver the long run, bitcoin mining is a race to zero. Competition chases lower and lower spreads, looking for stranded and excess electricity, moving closer to power producers, and eliminating all excess costs. It's hard to say what the future holds for Bitcoin mining at scale. Still, software-enabled management over sites is becoming non-negotiable for miners as competition for more hash rate and lower electricity costs heats up.\n\nThis is a guest post by Mitch Klee.

        "content": "Welcome to the world of cryptocurrencies, where getting into the market is like strapping yourself on a rollercoaster ride. But fear not, my fellow crypto enthusiasts! In this article, we will discuss why buying Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) during the bear market can actually be a good thing. Plus, we\u2019ll introduce you to a new crypto project called SignupToken that might just make you a millionaire.\n\nThe Bear Market: A Chance to Buy Low\n\nRemember that old saying, \u201cbuy low, sell high\u201d? Well, that applies to crypto too. When the market is in a bearish state, prices are low, making it the perfect opportunity to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sure, it might be tempting to wait until the market turns bullish again, but by then, prices will be higher, and you\u2019ll have missed out on potential gains.\n\nHODL: A Crypto Mantra\n\nHODL (hold on for dear life) is a term coined by a crypto enthusiast who misspelt \u201chold\u201d in a forum post. But the term has taken on a life of its own and has become a crypto mantra. The idea is to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum and hold it for the long term, despite market fluctuations. This strategy has worked well for many crypto investors, and it could work for you too.\n\nSignupToken: The New Crypto Project That Could Make You a Millionaire\n\nSignupToken is a brand new cryptocurrency that is trying something new in the space. When it reaches 1 million signups, they will launch the token directly into cryptocurrency exchanges, and you will be the first to hear about it. They are looking to create 1 million millionaires, and you could be one of them!\n\nThe concept is simple \u2013 sign up for free with your email address, and you\u2019ll receive information on the launch date. There\u2019s nothing to lose, and being one of the first to invest when it launches could provide big profits. Plus, the token launch will happen directly on crypto exchanges, eliminating any worries about scams or frauds.\n\nLow Risk, High Reward\n\nThe beauty of SignupToken is that it offers a low barrier to entry for first-time crypto investors. Signing up takes only a minute, and there\u2019s no cost to become involved. It could be a game-changer for those who have been hesitant to dip their toes into the crypto waters. And let\u2019s face it, who doesn\u2019t love a good low-risk, high-reward opportunity?\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the success of SignupToken could lead to significant media attention, increasing the token\u2019s value if it does launch. It\u2019s a project worth keeping an eye on, especially if you\u2019re looking for a low-risk investment that could pay off big.\n\nTo Conclude\n\nThe crypto market can be daunting, but by taking advantage of the bear market and holding onto your investments for the long term, you could see significant gains. And if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, give SignupToken a shot. It\u2019s free to sign up, and who knows \u2013 you might just become one of the 1 million millionaires they\u2019re aiming to create!\n\nFollow the Link For More Information on Sign Up Token!\n\nWebsite: www.signuptoken.com\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The week hasn\u2019t been one of roses and sunshine for investors betting on Bitcoin and Ethereum, but for Big Eyes Coin lovers, the honeymoon phase has only just begun.\n\nOn a whole, the market has not been doing well all week, with more reds than greens in what people are describing as a delayed reaction to the series of news affecting the crypto scene of late. Bitcoin has fallen back to $22k after much anticipation that it would hit $25k by the end of this quarter, and Ethereum hasn\u2019t fared much better with its current price of $1.5k.\n\nBIG, on the other hand, is unaffected as it continues to enjoy a successful presale journey and expand on its popularity and appeal.\n\nBig Eyes Sets A New Pre-sale Record\n\nBig Eyes has a large and unified following, contributing to the presale sales of $31.24 million. The coin has achieved the most amazing presale in the last two years, making history in the process. Due to the success of its presale, the team is offering intriguing rewards.\n\nIn addition to the exciting loot boxes that have been released, the meme coin has just introduced a vault pin that allows users to get up to 5,000% extra BIG tokens when they buy a loot box. When making a purchase, one is required to enter the pin, which is 819.\n\nThe Excali-Paw Chest, which costs $100,000, was just revealed one week ago as a new loot box that may enable one to win up to $1 million worth of Prizes.\n\nThe other boxes are the Saver tin, which costs $100, the Cute Box goes for $1,000, the Kitty Vault \u2013 $5,000; and the Saiyan box for $10,000.\n\nThe loot boxes are safe compared to any dangerous endeavour because everyone is guaranteed to receive at least a portion of what they put in. Less is not an option; only equal to or greater is.\n\nHas Bitcoin Hit A Wall?\n\nThroughout the previous 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin has remained stable at just above $22,000. Despite this, the largest digital asset is still up by roughly one-third in 2023 thanks to its early-year gain, but Bitcoin has already dropped below its recent peak of $25,000.\n\nThe $23,000 to $24,000 area, which had reigned for all of February, was also decisively thrown in the rear-view by a severe selloff this week, wiping out optimistic traders who were relying on Bitcoin\u2019s recovery into a new bull market after a terrible 2022.\n\nWhile investors try to stay optimistic, many are wondering if BTC hasn\u2019t hit a wall in its ascent and is unable to push through.\n\nEthereum price goes down\n\nSince June 2022, the value of Ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum, has increased by 78%. Yet, this does not ensure additional gains, especially given that dropping trade volumes indicate a strong likelihood of a significant correction.\n\nThe trading volume tracks activities around the buying and selling of the coin. This is usually an indication of how well the coin is doing or not doing. In the last 24 hours, ETH fell by 0.42%, and this has been the consistent pattern all week.\n\nIt is currently selling for $1,556.43 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $6,769,307,144 USD as of the time of this writing.\n\nIt still remains number 2 on the crypto chart with a live market cap of $190,465,827,618 USD.\n\nClick below for more on Big Eyes Coin:\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "In the spring of 2024, the next halving of Bitcoin will take place: what will be the impact on the price of BTC?\n\nSo far there have already been three halvings, and in all and among cases the price of Bitcoin the following year rose.\n\nThe past three halvings\n\nThe first halving occurred in November 2012, or just under four years after Bitcoin mining began on January 3, 2009, with the creation of the first block.\n\nAt that time Bitcoin was worth about $13, and the following year saw the first and largest speculative bubble that ever occurred in the price of BTC.\n\nIn fact, within about a year the price skyrocketed to a peak at $1,100, or an 8,300 percent gain in less than twelve months.\n\nIt must be said that the first halving brought down the inflation rate of Bitcoin\u2018s money supply.\n\nAll existing BTC was created as a premium for miners who validated blocks, and initially, that premium was 50 BTC per block.\n\nWith a block every 10 minutes or so, about 2.6 million bitcoins were being created annually, and since only 8 million BTC had been created by the end of 2011, the annual inflation rate of the Bitcoin money supply then was 32 percent.\n\nWith the first halving, the creation of new BTC dropped to 1.3 million per year, and since in meantime by the end of 2012 the BTC created had risen to 10.6 million, and the inflation rate of the Bitcoin money supply suddenly collapsed to 12 percent.\n\nSuch a sudden collapse almost instantaneously reduced the supply of BTC in the market, triggering a price growth due to relatively constant demand, which from January 2013 to November of that year generated that incredible percentage gain.\n\nIt is no coincidence that a large speculative bubble also inflated the year following the second halving.\n\nThe second halving\n\nThe second halving occurred in July 2016, but it did not immediately trigger growth.\n\nAt that time, the premium for miners rose from 25 to 12.5 BTC per block, bringing the number of new BTC minted each year to 650,000. Since by the end of 2016 a total of about 16 million BTC had already been created, the annual inflation rate of Bitcoin\u2019s money supply collapsed to 4 percent.\n\nThe price began to rise in October of that year and then soared especially from April 2017.\n\nDuring that year, the price reached $20,000, then a gain of 1,700 percent from the previous high in 2013.\n\nThe third halving\n\nThe third and final halving occurred in May 2020, when the premium for miners was raised to 6.25 BTC per block.\n\nSo since then just under 330,000 new BTC are created each year, and since 18.5 million Bitcoins had already been created by the end of 2020, the annual inflation rate of its money supply fell below 2 percent.\n\nIn November of that year, the price began to rise, and as early as the following month the last major bubble began to form.\n\nThis, however, brought the price of Bitcoin to just under $70,000 in November 2021, or a gain of only 250 percent from the previous peak.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next halving and price predictions.\n\nSince a halving occurs automatically every exactly 210,000 blocks, and since the 840,000 block is only just under 60,000 blocks away, with a block mined every 10 minutes or so, it is estimated that the next halving will occur in spring 2024.\n\nAt that point, there will be more than 20.3 Bitcoins created, and the reduction to 160,000 new BTC created each year will bring the annual inflation rate of the Bitcoin money supply down below 1 percent.\n\nSo this will not be a real collapse, like the one that happened in 12% that suddenly brought this inflation rate from 32% to 12%, but a much smaller reduction that will bring it from less than 2% to less than 1%.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that the 2024 halving will immediately have a major impact on the price of BTC, that is, as early as spring or summer of the same year, because it will not reduce the supply in the market by much.\n\nMoreover, all three halvings that have already taken place have caused the price of Bitcoin to rise less and less, from +8,300% to +1,700% to +250%.\n\nIt is by no means impossible that in 2024, or 2025, the price of Bitcoin could increase, but it is unlikely to increase by those percentages.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that in recent years other cryptocurrencies have drained capital from the crypto markets, which were once concentrated mainly on Bitcoin, so all the more reason why the increase might be smaller, or even not there at all."
