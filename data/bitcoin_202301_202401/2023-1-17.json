        "content": "Bitcoin has held steady above $21,000 for the last two days, bringing it back above the price it was when Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange, FTX , began its slide toward bankruptcy.\n\nSince Monday, bitcoin has largely held steady above $21,000, well above its Nov. 2 price of $20,283.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has jumped more than 22% in the last seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin fell by that same amount in less than a day, between Nov. 7 and Nov. 8, as investors struggled to assess the impact of a potential FTX collapse and the likelihood of a Binance-backed FTX bailout. It dipped below $16,000 several times in the following weeks."

        "title": "Peter Thiel's fund wound down 8-year bitcoin bet before market crash - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nFounders Fund, the venture capital firm co-founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, closed almost all of its eight-year bet on cryptocurrencies shortly before the market began to crash last year, generating about $1.8bn in returns.\n\nThe San Francisco-based fund made its first investment in bitcoin in early 2014 and went on to invest large sums in crypto. About two-thirds of its overall investment was used to buy bitcoin, said people close to the fund.\n\nFounders Fund sold out of the vast majority of its entire cryptocurrency portfolio by the end of March 2022 \u2014 before the digital assets market became swept up in a crisis in May last year, said one of the people close to the fund.\n\nThe fund currently has no significant exposure to cryptocurrencies, the people said. The winding-down of its crypto bet has not previously been reported. Founders Fund declined to comment.\n\nThiel, a big backer of Republican candidates and a supporter of former US president Donald Trump, was one of the earliest mainstream investors to buy large sums of bitcoin and has subsequently been loudly bullish on the digital currency.\n\nIn April 2022, about the same time that Founders Fund sold out of most of its cryptocurrency holdings, Thiel said he was optimistic about the future of bitcoin. He told a cryptocurrency conference in Miami that \u201cwe\u2019re at the end of the fiat money regime\u201d and suggested its price \u2014 which was then trading at about $44,000 \u2014 could increase by a factor of 100.\n\nThiel said JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon and BlackRock boss Larry Fink \u201cneed to be allocating some of their money to bitcoin\u201d, adding: \u201cWe need to push back on them.\u201d\n\nThe price of bitcoin, which was launched in 2009, surged dramatically from roughly $750 in 2014 to an all-time high of more than $65,000 by November 2021. However, its price has been volatile in recent years, with several big collapses in value, including a drop to about $15,500 in November last year, a two-year low.\n\nThe digital assets market has been rocked by a crisis since May last year, forcing high-profile crypto companies such as Terraform Labs, Celsius, Voyager and Three Arrows Capital into bankruptcy.\n\nMarket sentiment towards crypto was damaged further in November when FTX, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, shut down owing creditors more than $3bn, and its co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was charged with multiple fraud charges.\n\nBy December, bitcoin had lost about three-quarters of its value from its peak and more than $2tn had been wiped off the value of the global crypto market.\n\nSeveral blue-chip Silicon Valley investors have piled into digital currencies in recent years, although most have focused their investments on equity stakes in crypto businesses rather than buying cryptocurrencies directly.\n\nSome exceptions to this include A16z crypto \u2014 the crypto arm of venture firm Andreessen Horowitz \u2014 which raised a $4.5bn fund last year and also invests directly in crypto coins and tokens.\n\nSimilarly, Paradigm, a crypto venture firm founded in 2018 by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang, raised a $2.5bn fund in late 2021.\n\nBut many large financial institutions stayed away from cryptocurrencies over fears about cyber security and their links to money laundering and drug trafficking. In 2017, JPMorgan\u2019s Dimon called bitcoin a \u201cfraud\u201d.\n\nFounders Fund\u2019s shift on crypto, which had been one of its core positions, was one of about nine big exits the venture fund made between 2020 and the end of last year that allowed it to return roughly $13bn to investors.\n\nOther exits also included the initial public offerings of companies it had backed since their early fundraisings, such as Airbnb and Palantir, the data analytics group that Thiel co-founded.\n\nThiel co-founded PayPal in 1998 and went on to become one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most successful investors, including being the first venture capitalist to back Facebook.\n\nFounders Fund has more than $11bn under management, including $5bn of capital raised across two funds last year, and has taken stakes in more than 100 companies, such as Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, ride-hailing app Lyft and defence tech group Anduril.\n\nThe fund is in talks to take an equity stake in OpenAI, the developer behind chatbot ChatGPT, at a valuation of $29bn."

        "title": "Bitcoin Rallies to Recoup Losses Since FTX Collapse (Published 2023) - The New York Times",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency bulls are extending one of the most unlikely rallies of the year so far, pushing Bitcoin above $21,000 for a second day. That means the digital currency has now recouped all its losses since the spectacular collapse of FTX in November.\n\nThe rising tide has lifted most crypto boats, the DealBook newsletter reports. Even some beaten-down tokens \u2014 including FTT, the in-house token of the bankrupt exchange FTX \u2014 have rebounded as investors bet the Federal Reserve will slow its interest rate increases, leading to a broad rally of risky assets. Shares in Coinbase, the publicly traded crypto exchange that has been laying off workers and cutting costs, gained at the market open in New York; it\u2019s up more than 30 percent over the past week.\n\nBut crypto analysts are divided on whether the rally is sustainable; by Wednesday afternoon, Bitcoin had fallen back below $21,000. Skeptics argue that the fundamentals for a long-term rise are missing, making the recent jump a risky bet for investors.\n\nThe crypto rally comes as lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm advising on FTX\u2019s multibillion-dollar bankruptcy, disclosed that the company\u2019s assets were worth roughly $5.5 billion, including $1.7 billion in cash and $3.5 billion in crypto assets. That makes this wider rally significant for FTX creditors \u2014 if it lasts."

        "content": "Well, that was quick. Less than two weeks after cryptocurrencies hit a nadir in the wake of the FTX collapse, Bitcoin has rallied 25% amid speculation the cryptocurrency selloff late last year was too much and too fast.\n\nKey Takeaways With Bitcoin gaining 25% and Ether jumping 20% in the past week, there's a bullish sentiment across the market.\n\nThe fall in inflation contributed to the recent rise in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nThe market has breached $1 trillion for the first time since the FTX collapse in November.\n\nBitcoin Gains Momentum\n\nWhen Consumer Price Index (CPI) report came last week that inflation is cooling off in most of the U.S. economy, Bitcoin hit a two-month high at $18,856, up 8%, as investors hoped that the Federal Reserve would reverse, or at least soften its rate hike policy. This suggests that Bitcoin is also becoming macro now, no longer a hedge against inflation.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin mining difficulty rose more than 10% to 37.59 trillion from 34.09 trillion on Sunday, a new all-time high. The difficulty of mining tends to increase when a blockchain network grows and is a sign of increased activity. The flagship cryptocurrency jumped traded at $21,130 at 11: 30 PM, New York time.\n\nEthereum Upgrade is on Horizon\n\nEther, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain network, gained over 17% in the past week, trading at $1,568 at 11: 30 PM, New York time. Apart from macroeconomic factors, the upcoming Shanghai upgrade on the network that allows users to withdraw their staked Ether has also contributed to this momentum.\n\nSimply put, the Shangahi upgrade follows 'The Merge' that shifted the Ethereum blockchain network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September 2022. A tentative timeline of March 2023 has been set for the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nBesides Bitcoin and Ethereum gains, Avalanche, NEAR, Aave, Polkadot, and Solana also surged over the past two weeks, helping the crypto market reclaim $1 trillion.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe surge in the market has given investors hope that crypto will continue to flourish despite layoffs and bankruptcy. Even a banking giant like Bank of America believes cryptos are the future and a new form of payment as it will likely change ''how and when value is transferred over the next 15 years.''\n\nAs the markets rebound, inflation cools, and signs of economic stability return, traders are optimistic about the resurgence of the crypto bull market.\n\n"

        "content": "One month before billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel raved about the advantages of Bitcoin during a speech at a Miami conference, his VC firm Founders Fund had already offloaded an eight-year bet on cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile crypto was once one of its core positions, by March 2022, the firm had generated $1.8 billion from selling off the vast majority of its crypto holdings, the Financial Times reported, citing a person close to the fund. Two-thirds of its crypto investment consisted of Bitcoin, according to the FT.\n\nThe selloff was timely, and protected the firm from the collapse in Bitcoin\u2019s price later that year that would take it to about $15,599 last November, its lowest price in two years.\n\nBut in April at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami, Thiel made no mention of his fund\u2019s massive crypto selloff. He also didn\u2019t waver in his support for Bitcoin. During a speech, he said, \u201cWe are at the end of the fiat money regime,\u201d and added that Bitcoin was undervalued but \u201chas every potential to replace gold.\u201d\n\nFounders Fund declined to comment to Reuters.\n\nThe price of almost all cryptocurrencies plummeted last year as the industry experienced the bankruptcies of some of its most high-profile companies, including the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto exchange FTX. The collapse of FTX and the criminal charges handed down to former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried in particular have caused damage to several other companies and have drawn outsized attention from regulators.\n\nSan Francisco-based Founders Fund first bought into Bitcoin in 2014 when it traded for under $1,000 and increased its holdings over the next eight years. Thiel was also one of the first well known investors to put money into Bitcoin.\n\nIn part, because of its Bitcoin selloff, along with exits from long-held companies like Airbnb and the Thiel-cofounded data analytics group Palantir, Founders Fund returned about $13 billion to investors between 2020 and the end of last year, according to the FT. The company has more than $11 billion under management."

        "title": "Is crypto about to go extinct? - Al Jazeera English",
        "content": "It will likely survive, but only after more firms and currencies crash and burn. Here\u2019s why.\n\nAs the Los Angeles Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals in the championship game of the National Football League last February, an unlikely set of players made a splash off the field, in living rooms across the United States.\n\nOn one of American television\u2019s biggest nights, with 99 million viewers, the Super Bowl broadcast was punctuated by a series of cryptocurrency advertisements. Social media buzzed with talk of how digital tokens had come of age as they grabbed primetime slots previously dominated by mainstream giants like Coca-Cola and General Motors.\n\nOne of the advertisements that night had comedian Larry David playing a Luddite dismissing humankind\u2019s biggest inventions \u2013 from the wheel to Edison\u2019s lightbulb to, the commercial suggests, the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Told that the platform is a \u201csafe and easy way to get into crypto\u201d, David\u2019s character says: \u201cEhhh, I don\u2019t think so \u2013 and I\u2019m never wrong about this stuff.\u201d\n\nThat advertisement hasn\u2019t aged well.\n\nWith multiple big crypto firms collapsing in recent months, the sector that promised an alternative to the traditional global financial model now faces existential questions. In May last year, the TerraUSD and Luna coins crashed, losing almost all of their value overnight and wiping out $45bn from the crypto market in a day. Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital abruptly shut down. Crypto lenders Voyager Digital and Celsius Network \u2013 which had both loaned money to Three Arrows Capital \u2013 soon filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAnd in November, FTX \u2013 the popular crypto trading platform in the Super Bowl advertisement \u2013 imploded. Its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas in December and has been charged with fraud. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s best-known cryptocurrency, is today worth only a third of what it was at its peak in October 2021.\n\nThe FTX commercial with David ends with the tagline, \u201cDon\u2019t be like Larry.\u201d Today, many of the 420 million people estimated to have invested in crypto might well be wishing they had been more like Larry.\n\nSo is crypto about to go extinct?\n\nThe short answer: As a concept, cryptocurrencies will probably survive, experts told Al Jazeera. But the sector will likely face increased regulation and an extended period of uncertainty. Many firms and currencies will perish. To stay alive, companies will face one challenge above all else: winning back customer trust.\n\nCrypto \u2018ice age\u2019\n\nCryptocurrency trading platforms have traditionally drawn in customers with the promise of quick returns on investment. The offer: Park money in so-called crypto wallets \u2013 which are meant to function in a manner similar to savings bank accounts \u2013 and earn high interest rates, sometimes in double digits. For those who are distrustful of traditional finance, the opportunity to carry out transactions without worrying about a regulator as an intermediary is an added attraction.\n\nBut this allure dimmed once the US Federal Reserve and other major central banks around the world sharply raised interest rates through 2022, making more traditional investment options more lucrative than before. The US rate, for instance, shot up by more than 4 percentage points over the course of 2022.\n\nOnce TerraUSD and Luna went into freefall, a combination of safer alternatives and reduced trust in crypto led to a crisis that, according to experts, is far from over.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll see a lot more bad news before things start looking better for the sector,\u201d Tim Leung, director of the computational finance and risk management programme at the University of Washington in Seattle told Al Jazeera.\n\nWith many potential customers now sceptical, crypto platforms will likely witness low trading volumes for a while, Leung said. The crypto sector likes to pride itself on its independence, but it depends on financing from traditional markets. How much of that funding will continue in the current climate is unclear, Leung suggested. With reduced trading and less funding, many smaller firms might go belly up, he warned.\n\nCrypto mining companies, which generate virtual money \u2013 or coins \u2013 using energy-guzzling supercomputers, will suffer too, Leung said. Reduced demand for coins because of low trading volumes and high energy prices will squeeze the viability of their business model. \u201cI see this phase lasting through 2023,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely to be a crypto ice age rather than a crypto winter.\u201d\n\nThe downturn isn\u2019t surprising, suggested experts.\n\n\u201cThis is a start-up industry with hundreds of firms and lots of innovation,\u201d said David Yermack, professor of finance at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. He told Al Jazeera he expects a chaotic period for cryptocurrencies in the foreseeable future but thinks that \u201cultimately best practices will emerge through competition\u201d.\n\nGovernments around the world have signalled plans to step in to shield customers from that chaos. But regulators and analysts appear divided on how best to intervene.\n\nOld laws for new tech?\n\nGary Gensler, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), argued in September that existing laws are adequate for the crypto sector. In his view, he said, most cryptocurrencies are similar to traditional securities \u2013 tradable financial assets like stocks or bonds.\n\nHilary Allen, professor of law at American University in Washington, DC, agrees with that approach. Cryptocurrencies and trading platforms, she said, must meet the standards of governance that the SEC demands from old-school securities \u2013 including registering with the regulator and demonstrating transparency over assets \u2013 or be shut down.\n\nCreating new rules for the crypto industry would be wrong, she said. \u201cThat would legitimise the idea that crypto, somehow, is unique, and can\u2019t be expected to meet the same standards as mainstream financial assets,\u201d Allen told Al Jazeera. \u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous message to send.\u201d\n\nBut many other experts disagree.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental difference between securities and currencies,\u201d said Bruno Biais, a professor of finance at the HEC Paris business school. People invest in stocks or bonds based on the cash flow or assets of the company offering them, he said. They buy currency \u2013 whether a dollar, a euro or a crypto token \u2013 trusting that the coin or note will be accepted by others at a later date.\n\nTrying to fit an existing regulatory framework on cryptocurrencies without adapting it to new technology won\u2019t work, said Christian Catalini, founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Cryptoeconomics Lab.\n\nIt won\u2019t guarantee consumer protection, Catalini told Al Jazeera. \u201cWorse, it may kill the innovation potential of the space without any meaningful benefit to the public,\u201d he said.\n\nWhere most analysts do agree is that regulations for the sector must focus on one kind of cryptocurrency in particular: so-called stablecoins.\n\nMaking \u2018stablecoins\u2019 stable\n\nUnlike tokens like Bitcoin, whose price can fluctuate wildly, the value of stablecoins is pegged to a regular currency, like the US dollar or other traditional assets like gold. For instance, each Tether coin, the world\u2019s most popular stablecoin \u2013 which often trades even more than Bitcoin \u2013 is worth $1. That value stability positions stablecoins as tokens that, while still earning well through crypto wallets, are supposedly safer than other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThe very term, \u2018stablecoin\u2019, conjures the image of a reliable currency that gives customers a false sense of security,\u201d Biais told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe problem? Unlike regular currencies and banks, stablecoins are basically completely unregulated.\u201d\n\nSo while in theory, those who own $100 worth of stablecoins should be able to redeem that amount whenever they want \u2013 as would be the case with a banknote \u2013 there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll actually get that money back, said Biais.\n\nThe Financial Stability Board (FSB), a global advisory body set up by the G20 after the 2008 financial crisis, has been urging major economies to adopt regulations to ensure that stablecoins demonstrate their ability to pay customers back. In its October 2022 report, the FSB warned that many existing stablecoins \u201care issued by unregistered and unlicensed entities and do not have credible mechanisms to support their promise of price stability\u201d.\n\nWhile US regulators appear undecided on the need for new rules, many other nations and regions are moving towards laws specifically designed to govern the crypto sector and, in particular, stablecoins. These rules could help ensure that \u201cgood actors thrive, and bad actors disappear from the crypto ecosystem\u201d, said Catalini.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s new regulation, known as Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), will require all crypto firms to register with authorities. Stablecoins will need to guarantee assets to pay customers back at any time. MiCA comes into force in 2024.\n\nJapan passed a law last June under which only banks and other strictly regulated financial institutions can offer stablecoins. And the British government has proposed that the Financial Conduct Authority, the country\u2019s top financial services regulator, would have oversight over crypto firms.\n\nMeanwhile, India\u2019s finance minister has said that crypto regulations would be a priority of the country\u2019s G20 presidency in 2023. A global framework to regulate crypto is indeed essential, said Leung of the University of Washington, since many firms in the sector have a footprint across geographies.\n\nBut for any of this to help revive the industry, crypto firms will first need to regain the confidence of customers, said experts.\n\nMatter of trust\n\nMany crypto enthusiasts will likely watch to see how big cases of fraud, such as the one involving FTX, play out, said Biais of HEC Paris. If they see justice, and if those who have lost money because of such scams get it back, that would help rebuild trust, he said.\n\nSome experts, like Allen at American University, believe that crypto has little to meaningfully offer to the financial world in the future. \u201cWhen you peel away the rhetoric, there really isn\u2019t anything there that you can\u2019t do using traditional finance instruments,\u201d she said.\n\nOthers remain convinced that crypto, with its potential to enable peer-to-peer, decentralised financial exchanges, represents a transformational technology. \u201cThe technology is here to stay, even if a number of the initial projects in the crypto space are falling,\u201d MIT\u2019s Catalini said.\n\nHe described the moment as similar to the dot-com bubble that burst in the late 1990s when many early online firms went bust. Those \u2013 like Amazon \u2013 that survived or came up later are among \u201cthe internet giants of today\u201d, he said.\n\nStill, until the dust settles and reliable regulations come in, Leung at the University of Washington said it\u2019s best to be cautious. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to make decisions based on Super Bowl commercials,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game.\u201d"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market can be volatile --\u00ad\u00ad sometimes reaching record highs and other times dropping significantly. Understanding how cryptocurrency is valued can help explain these changes.\n\nCryptocurrency is not the same as the U.S. dollar or the Euro because there is no central authority -- such as a government body -- to manage its value. Without a centralized organizing body, there are no concrete reasons for cryptocurrency to change in value.\n\nThe main theory behind cryptocurrency value is if enough people agree it is valuable, then it becomes more valuable. Without regulation, demand can cause fluctuations -- and in some cases, the changes can be extreme -- depending on additional factors such as availability, utility and competition.\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is a digital and encrypted asset that is used for exchange. It can be used similarly to fiat currencies to exchange for goods, services and investments. Fiat currencies are government-issued -- such as the current money system people use every day. Cryptocurrency is different from digital currency. Digital currency can be turned into cash by going to an ATM or bank because it is backed by a financial institution. With cryptocurrency, transactions are recorded on the blockchain and are not verified by a financial institution like digital currency. The blockchain is a financial ledger or database that stores electronic information digitally to show ownership. Users can exchange cryptocurrency directly with others. Here are the four types of blockchain technology.\n\nHistory of cryptocurrency The idea of cryptocurrency originated in the 1980s. The idea was to send currency that could not be traced and didn't require centralization. David Chaum -- an American cryptographer -- created anonymous money called DigiCash. It was the first form of electronic payment requiring software and encrypted keys to send and withdraw money. Next, came Bit Gold, which is often considered the precursor to Bitcoin. Nick Szabo designed it in 1998, and it required solving a puzzle to get the reward. When these two concepts are put together, they are similar to Bitcoin. In 1998, Satoshi Nakamoto published Bitcoin \u2013 A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, a white paper that described the blockchain network and its technology. He described Bitcoin as \"an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.\" He also said in this paper that cryptocurrency would not be possible without blockchain technology. Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first bitcoin in 2009. The first block of 50 bitcoin -- known as the Genesis Block -- had no real value for the first few months. Then in April 2021, the value of one bitcoin reached 14 cents. The value then surged to 36 cents in November 2021. Bitcoin began to steadily rise. With publicity in publications such as Forbes, prices started to increase. Other forms of cryptocurrency then started to be created, using blockchain technology. Now there are several different types of cryptocurrency with new ones emerging regularly. Other well-known cryptocurrencies include the following: The main theory behind cryptocurrency value is if enough people agree it is valuable, then it becomes more valuable. Ethereum\n\nDogecoin\n\nTether\n\nXRP\n\nSolana\n\nPolkaDot\n\nCardano\n\nShiba Inu\n\nBinance Coin\n\nUSD Coin Learn more about the history of blockchain technology here.\n\nCost of production Mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency tokens. This process involves using software to verify the block on the blockchain to decentralize and form the token. To verify the blockchain, participants need to use computing power and solve transaction-related algorithms. However, there is a competition to mine certain cryptocurrencies largely due to the miners racing each other to verify the next block, which can make it more difficult to mine. The cost to mine increases when more powerful equipment is needed, which can be costly. Higher mining costs push up the value of the cryptocurrency to offset the costs of production. Because the costs are high, attackers use cryptojacking with unauthorized use of other systems to mine cryptocurrency for the power demands. Cryptojacking can also be completed by a cryptomining bot installed on a target system.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges The more popular cryptocurrencies, such as Ether and Bitcoin, are available to trade on multiple exchanges. The smaller tokens may only be on certain exchanges, which limits access. If a cryptocurrency is listed on more exchanges, they will be available to more investors, which can increase the demand. To purchase cryptocurrency, users need to create an account on a cryptocurrency broker, such as Coinbase, eToro or Gemini. Opening an account on these exchanges is similar to opening any other investment account. If a user wants to exchange one cryptocurrency for another, this is possible using cross-chain bridges. It's similar to the exchange between different country currencies. There are several cross-chain bridges to help explore various blockchain ecosystems. Learn more about the best cross-chain bridges available here. After purchasing cryptocurrency, the next step is storage. Since they are not backed, they are at risk for theft. There are three methods to store cryptocurrency. Leave cryptocurrency in exchange. After buying the cryptocurrency, the exchanges have a cryptocurrency wallet to store purchases. This method is the most at-risk for theft because the exchange markets are a prime target for thieves. For example, in February 2022, thieves stole more than $320 million on the Wormhole cryptocurrency platform. Hot wallets. These cryptocurrency wallets are stored online outside of the exchange. They run on all internet devices and run a risk of theft since they are stored online. In addition, there are apps for smartphones to store cryptocurrency, and these are also considered hot wallets. Cold wallets. Unlike hot wallets, cold wallets are stored offline on an external device. All the information is stored within this device making it the safest option. But don't lose the keycode, or it may be difficult to get the cryptocurrency back. Learn more about securing a bitcoin wallet here.\n\nHow does cryptocurrency gain value? In the stock market, a company's worth is determined by multiplying the stock price by the number of shares to show market capitalization. The price of the stock can go up or down depending on supply and demand. Higher demand stock have higher prices, such as Apple and Amazon. The same theory applies to cryptocurrency. Higher demand pushes prices up. If demand goes higher than the amount available, the price of that cryptocurrency increases. Some cryptocurrencies have a maximum supply and only increase by a fixed amount, such as bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies \u2013 such as Ether \u2013 do not have supply limitations. Demand for cryptocurrency depends on many factors, including how useful the coins are and if businesses accept them. There are other factors that also determine the value of cryptocurrency, including the following: Mining. When trying to create the new block, miners compete for that encrypted number, and the first miner wins the newly minted cryptocurrency. Mining can be expensive, especially with the amount of electricity needed to complete it.\n\nWhen trying to create the new block, miners compete for that encrypted number, and the first miner wins the newly minted cryptocurrency. Mining can be expensive, especially with the amount of electricity needed to complete it. Increasing utility. Utility increases when businesses accept cryptocurrency and if there is an investment opportunity. Being able to use it in decentralized finance protocols or decentralized apps can also affect value. Think about an Amazon gift card versus a small store gift card -- there are more options for the Amazon gift card, giving it more utility.\n\nUtility increases when businesses accept cryptocurrency and if there is an investment opportunity.

Some investors appreciate the freedom of no regulations while others fear the lack of regulation and security. Availability. If the cryptocurrency is more readily available on numerous exchanges, it may be more valuable.\n\nRegulations and governance Developers adapt projects based on current and future use. However, governance tokens require stakeholders to give consensus for any changes. Investors like stable governance, and this can be considered a flaw with cryptocurrency. There is volatility in its value and it can make severe swings. For example, bitcoin's value fell below $20,000 in June 2022 after hitting a high of $68,789.63 in 2021. There is some uncertainty in terms of the regulation of cryptocurrencies. There is confusion on whether cryptocurrency is a commodity, such as gold or silver, or a security, such as stocks or bonds. Because of this indecision, neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission can regulate cryptocurrency. Regulations could have a positive impact because investors would feel more secure about purchasing cryptocurrency as an investment. However, regulations could also negatively affect the value of cryptocurrency by lowering the demand and changing rules for investments. Learn more about a Senate bill to regulate cryptocurrency."

        "title": "Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "How does Bitcoin DeFi work? Wrapped tokens like Wrapped Bitcoin, layer-1 blockchains like Stacks, and sidechains like Rootstock enable DeFi on Bitcoin. The scripting language used by Bitcoin, termed Script, is not Turing complete, which means it is deficient in several logical operations, such as loops. As a result, the Bitcoin network supports limited programmability despite the Taproot upgrade, meaning that Bitcoin DeFi platforms rely on layer-2 scaling solutions and sidechains to host their smart contracts. DeFi on Bitcoin is made possible through wrapped tokens like Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), layer-1 blockchains like Stacks and sidechains like Rootstock. For instance, wBTC, an Ethereum token introduced in January 2019, is backed one-to-one by Bitcoin (BTC), meaning that one wBTC is always equivalent to 1 BTC. Users can engage with several of Ethereum\u2019s DApps using the wBTC token. An independent layer-1 blockchain called Stacks makes hundreds of billions of dollars in capital in BTC available and offers Bitcoin holders new ways to use and profit from the cryptocurrency. It uses a proof-of-transfer consensus mechanism, which secures its blockchain by utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work blockchain. DeFi products like the Stackswap DEX leverage the Stacks blockchain to allow users to trade and mint NFTs, borrow algorithmic stablecoins, and launch and exchange tokens on the Bitcoin network. Additionally, since Stacks and Bitcoin are linked, NFTs created on Stacks settle to and are secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. Turing-complete smart contracts are made possible on the Bitcoin blockchain by Rootstock, which runs parallel to the blockchain. When BTC is sent to Rootstock, it transforms into RBTC, a smart contract-enabled Bitcoin. Based on bidirectional communication, this protocol serves as a bridge to connect both chains. For instance, Sovryn, one of the first permissionless financial apps, utilizes RSK\u2019s technology to connect to the Lightning Network, Ethereum, Bitcoin and BNB Smart Chain.\n\nWhich DeFi projects are part of the Bitcoin ecosystem? Besides wBTC, Stacks and Rootstock, BadgerDAO, RenVM and Liquid Network promote various use cases of Bitcoin DeFi. BadgerDAO A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called BadgerDAO makes it possible for BTC to be utilized as collateral across various DApps. The BadgerDAO uses the Ethereum-based token BADGER for protocol governance and incentive distribution. Users can earn income on their synthetic BTC assets using Sett Vaults, the first product offered by Badger. Users can lock up their tokenized Bitcoin in SETTs, which are pools of tokens, and let smart contracts manage their holdings to produce a yield in the form of bTokens. The second product from Badger, called Digg, is software that controls the elastic-supply cryptocurrency called the DIGG token, pegged to the price of BTC in United States dollars. Like any other token, DIGG can be deposited into SETTs to provide a yield for its holders and used in DeFi protocols. RenVM The decentralized Ethereum protocol Ren creates tokens that monitor the value of non-Ethereum assets such as Bitcoin and offers liquidity to projects on several blockchains. That said, Bitcoin holders may utilize Ren (needed to pay nodes) to access Ethereum\u2019s array of DeFi products without selling their BTC or moving their assets across blockchains. The Ren virtual machine holds the original funds in storage, accepts tokens from one blockchain, and generates new tokens on another through its RenBridge to exchange assets between blockchains. For example, a user may submit BTC to the RenVM, which would issue renBTC, a new token on Ethereum that would reflect the original Bitcoin, meaning when the user wants to get their Bitcoin back, the transaction may be reversed. Liquid Network The Liquid Network is a layer-2 Bitcoin solution and an inter-exchange settlement network that enables the issue of digital assets like security tokens, stablecoins and other financial instruments privately and quickly on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. LBTC, a wrapped version of Bitcoin, serves as the native token on the Liquid sidechain. Users send BTC to a Lightning Network address (a process called peg-in) on the Bitcoin network to use the Liquid Network. A similar quantity of LBTC is minted on the Liquid Network and delivered to the user\u2019s address after the transaction has received 102 confirmations. In addition, peg-out can be initiated to withdraw BTC by sending LBTC for burning to an irrecoverable address, which, when receiving two separate confirmations, lets a Lightning Network member send the original BTC to a user\u2019s Bitcoin network address."

        "content": "Glassnode data analyzed by CryptoSlate shows that Marathon, Hut8, and Riot built the top three largest Bitcoin (BTC) pools, while Bit Digital recorded a 134% growth in reserves in nine months.\n\nBTC miners in 2022\n\nBTC miners entered the year 2022 with resources acquired through cheap debt in 2021. The majority of them invested these resources into growing their ASICS, which kept increasing their BTC holdings until May.\n\nHowever, the bear market started in May introduced immense pressure and led to distribution across miners. The Russian-Ukraine war increased energy costs, the BTC price fell, and the hash rate increased, which heated the competition for block space.\n\nDistribution emerged as the main theme for BTC miners in the second half of 2022. However, the BTC volume in exchanges didn\u2019t grow. Throughout the whole year, less than 60,000 BTC got sent to exchanges.\n\nYear-end reserves\n\nMarathon, Hut8, and Riot became the top three companies with the largest total BTC holdings, with 12,232 BTC, 9,086 BTC, and 6,952 BTC, respectively.\n\nMarathon\u2019s holdings account for 27.7% of the combined BTC pool of the top nine mining companies, while Hut8 and Riot account for 20.4% and 17.5%, respectively.\n\nTop 9 Companies\n\nCryptoSlate analyzed the top nine BTC mining companies in detail. Marathon, Hut8, HIVE, Riot, and Bit Digital ended the year by growing their holdings.\n\nHowever, Bit Digital recorded the most impressive growth in mining capabilities throughout the year. Bit Digital started its operations in April and mined 754 BTC in the first month. For the rest of the year, the company recorded a 134% growth in reserves and reached 1,765 in December.\n\nMarathon started the year with 8,595 BTC, recorded a 42% increase, and saw 12,232 BTC in December. The 5,826 BTC Hut8 had in January increased to 9,086 by December, reflecting an almost 56% increase. Finally, HIVE\u2019s January reserves were at 2,043 BTC, which grew by 14.9% throughout the year and reached 2,348 BTC in December.\n\nBitfarms entered the year with 4,600 BTC and recorded a 91% decrease by falling to 405 BTC in December. Similarly, Argo held 2,748 BTC in January, which fell to 141 BTC in December, marking a 94.8% decrease. CleanSpark\u2018s BTC reserves fell by 51%, falling from January\u2019s 471 to December\u2019s 228. Finally, Core Scientific couldn\u2019t survive the winter. The company entered the year with 6,373 BTC and went bankrupt in December.\n\nFirst two weeks of 2023\n\nThe year 2023 started with the least amount of selling pressure of the past three years.

The College of Engineering and the Mays Business School will be offering a course called \"Bitcoin Protocol\" starting on January 17th, which will be taught by Korok Ray, an associate professor at the Mays Business School.Professor Ray announced in a series of tweets that after taking the \"Bitcoin Protocol\" course, students would be taught \"Programming Bitcoin,\" where they will learn how to develop their own Bitcoin library. He also mentioned that it took months of effort to get the courses approved by the school's curriculum committee.In addition to teaching about the technical aspects of blockchain technology and crypto, U.S. colleges are now also offering courses on the legal and regulatory issues related to these fields.An adjunct professor at Boston University's Law School, Thomas Hook, recently announced that the school now offers a course called \"Crypto Regulation\" for students who are interested in learning about how lawyers and companies in the crypto industry can navigate through regulatory challenges when bringing their products and services to market. According to Professor Hook, the course is designed to give future lawyers an understanding of the various legal and regulatory issues that companies in the crypto industry may face around the world.Several other universities have also begun offering courses on crypto, including Harvard, MIT, Oxford, National University of Singapore, Cornell, and University of California Berkeley.According to crypto researcher Josh Cowell, one of the major obstacles hindering widespread adoption of crypto is a lack of good educational resources. He believes that providing high-quality education about crypto can help improve people's financial literacy and overall understanding of this technology."

        "title": "Bitcoin surges as investors return to riskier assets - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe price of bitcoin has surged nearly 30 per cent against the dollar in January, raising hopes among its faithful followers that the crypto market is emerging from the credit crisis that gripped it for much of last year.\n\nThe token, the most actively traded in the industry, has soared to more than $21,000 in the past week, breaking out of the tight range around $17,000 upon which it had settled following the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange in November.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has joined traditional financial assets such as stocks and bonds in rallying this year as investors become increasingly confident that the US Federal Reserve\u2019s policy of rapid rates rises to combat inflation is beginning to moderate. Last week, the US consumer price index posted an inflation rate of 6.5 per cent in December, the sixth consecutive month of decline.\n\n\n\nAlthough bitcoin enthusiasts argue the token can be a hedge against inflation, in the past year it has often fluctuated in line with shifts in consumer prices and interest rate expectations. The price began to tumble from its record high of nearly $70,000 in November 2021 when investors realised inflation was soaring.\n\n\u201cThe overall rally across most asset classes year to date due to hopes of a \u2018soft landing\u2019 for the US economy is boosting sentiment in crypto,\u201d said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, JPMorgan managing director focused on alternatives and digital assets.\n\nHe added that a weakening dollar also helped as it boosted the price of commodities such as gold, in turn helping to \u201creprice bitcoin as a substitute asset class\u201d.\n\nThe optimism has spread to other crypto-related assets. Ether, the second most traded cryptocurrency, has risen 31 per cent this month to more than $1,575, according to Refinitiv data. The token is widely used as a building block for ambitious crypto projects because it allows programmers to code functions to automatically buy and sell assets.\n\nOverall, the market value of the top 500 crypto tokens has risen back to $1tn from $830bn at the end of last year. It remains well off its November 2021 peak above $3.2tn, according to data from the Financial Times Digital Assets Dashboard.\n\n\u201cIf inflation is now retreating, pressure on the Fed and other central banks to raise rates aggressively will be reduced, enabling a gentle shift back to more \u2018risk-on\u2019 strategies,\u201d said Edmond Goh, head of trading at B2C2, a crypto market maker.\n\nHowever, confidence in crypto markets remains fragile, in part because investors are wary of further sudden shocks after the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX.\n\n\u201cSome upside volatility was due to come eventually and does not mean that this move upwards will be sustainable,\u201d said David Moreno Darocas, research lead at data provider CryptoCompare.\n\nThe fate of Genesis, one of the biggest lenders in the crypto market, in particular is uncertain. It halted customer withdrawals at its lending unit in November after FTX\u2019s failure, blaming \u201cunprecedented market turmoil\u201d and owes its creditors more than $3bn. Its parent, crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group, is trying to raise capital and avoid the bankruptcy of Genesis.\n\nOther bellwether names, including crypto-focused bank Silvergate and crypto exchanges Coinbase and Crypto.com, said they would extensively cut headcount.\n\nResearch provider Kaiko noted that prices rallied last week in part because traders who were betting on bitcoin to fall were caught in a short squeeze, pushing prices higher.\n\nIt also pointed out that market liquidity, or the ability to easily buy and sell assets at prevailing market prices, remained very weak. Nearly 90 per cent of bitcoin trades are conducted using a stablecoin, tokens intended to track real-world currencies and maintain a steady value, it said.\n\nLiquidity for both bitcoin and ether, as measured by the number of offers to buy and sell the tokens within 2 per cent of their price against the stablecoin Tether, had fallen by a fifth since early January to levels seen in the aftermath of the FTX fallout, Kaiko found.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is unclear why liquidity temporarily recovered but failed to stick around, especially over the past few days, which has seen the highest trade volumes since early November,\u201d it said.\n\nBut some see another possible market shakeout as the last squeeze of a market that has been caught in a whirlwind since the sudden failure of the TerraUSD stablecoin last May.\n\n\u201cIn my view, Genesis is the last domino to wobble since this sorry contagion crisis began with Terra months ago,\u201d said Ian Taylor, board adviser at CryptoUK, a British crypto lobby group. \u201cEven if Genesis files for bankruptcy, it\u2019s kind of priced in.\u201d"

        "content": "2022 was \u201cthe perfect storm\u201d for Bitcoin (BTC) miners, according to Jaime Leverton, CEO of Hut8 Mining \u2014 one of the largest crypto miners and digital asset experts in the space.\n\nLeverton sat down with Gareth Jenkinson, senior reporter at Cointelegraph, in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Topics included were the 2022 bear market, Web3 diversification, and crucially, Bitcoin\u2019s growing positive impact on the environment and broader economy. Leverton shared that 2022 was a turbulent year for miners:\n\n\u201cObviously depressed Bitcoin prices, global hash rate continues to hit all-time highs, and then an energy crisis is thrown in the mix. So, it\u2019s certainly been a challenging time within the mining industry in particular.\u201d\n\nBitcoin hash rate, the ease at which miners can find a new block on the Bitcoin time chain and receive the block reward, has climbed higher in recent months. That\u2019s despite Bitcoin\u2019s price bobbing below $20,000. Mining profitability plunged as the hash difficulty surged. As a result, there were several Bitcoin and crypto miner casualties throughout 2022.\n\nHut 8 Bitcoin Mining Corp since Jan 2018. Source: Bitcointreasuries.net\n\nLeverton explained that a diversified strategy coupled with a successful mergers-and-acquisitions plan helped stave off insolvency risks for Hut 8.\n\nThe group recently spun up a \u201cBitcoin and mining repair facility for customers across Canada and Northern Europe.\u201d Meanwhile, a merger led to the purchase of \u201cfive enterprise-grade data centers and the associated business.\u201d Leverton highlighted that this move attempts to fill a gap in the market for digital infrastructure providers in the Web3 space:\n\n\u201cThey tend to be really dependent on the traditional Web2 hyperscalers as they try to build out these decentralized platforms. And obviously, when you\u2019re building a decentralized network, you don\u2019t want to do that in centralized infrastructure.\u201d\n\nWeb3, once a buzzword in the crypto space, has since become a hotly tipped trend for 2023, attracting 10-figure-plus investments from Hong Kong to Abu Dhabi. The entrance of Hut 8 into Web3 could usher more Bitcoin-only companies to consider opportunities in the Web3 space.\n\nHut 8 Mining Corp's holdings. Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net\n\nThe interview concluded with an astute discussion of Bitcoin mining and its role in protecting the environment. Leverton is a founding member of the Bitcoin Mining Council, a group engaged in dispelling the misinformation surrounding Bitcoin mining and seeking to \u201ctackle some of the misinformation that was coming out around Bitcoin\u2019s energy use, the sources of energy.\u201d\n\nLeverton explained that Bitcoin\u2019s transparency could in fact be its Achilles\u2019 heel:\n\n\u201cPart of the challenge we have is Bitcoin\u2019s energy use is so transparent \u2014 unlike every other industry in the world, where their energy consumption is opaque. With respect to Bitcoin mining, you can see the energy produced because, essentially, Bitcoin is digitized\u201d\n\nIn contrast, it is a Sisyphean task to quantify the entire energy output of banking or traditional finance, although it hasn\u2019t stopped some Bitcoin advocates from trying. In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, cryptographer Michel Khazzaka estimated that Bitcoin uses at least 56x less energy than banking.\n\nRelated: Seven times Bitcoin miners made the world a better place\n\nLeverton explained that there could be a disconnect between Bitcoin mining and its positive impact on both the environment and the economy. \u201cIt starts with education,\u201d she explained. A native Canadian, Leverton teed up an example of how Bitcoin mining creates jobs, stimulates the economy and even provides tax receipts in a small city in Alberta:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re their largest energy customer, their largest taxpayer, and a key provider of tech, labor and, in some cases, we also want to talk about joint curtailment with the city of Medicine Hat.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin mining can help to stabilize grids. Texas recently tinkered with the idea of using software to further balance the supply and demand of electricity to its grid using Bitcoin miners.

        "content": "The beginning of 2023 has provided Bitcoin (BTC) with bullish indicators and the rally to a year-to-date high at $21,647 has crypto traders hopeful that the worst part of the bear market has ended. The surge effect of BTC\u2019s bullish price action is also carrying over to Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin mining stocks.\n\nThe reduction in Bitcoin Fear and Greed index to neutral is possibly driven by volume increases, Bitcoin on-chain data and BTC price decoupling from equities markets.

        "title": "Tucker Carlson outlines wild theory to explain Bitcoin price rise: 'Maximum tin foil' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Controversial Fox news television host Tucker Carlson has proposed a curious conspiracy theory that seeks to link airline delays in the United States and Canada with a surge in the Bitcoin price.\n\nHe suggested the computer outage that caused thousands of grounded flights on Jan. 11 may have been caused by ransomware and theorized the US government may have bought a large amount of Bitcoin to pay the ransom.\n\nHowever he did not provide any evidence for his claims.\n\nSpeaking on his Tucker Carlson Tonight program on Fox News on Jan. 17, Carlson argued that the Bitcoin (BTC) price increased by over 20% soon after the travel chaos:\n\n\u201cAlmost all ransoms like this are paid in Bitcoin. So if the US government was buying huge amounts of Bitcoin in order to pay a ransom, Bitcoin prices would surge, of course. So the question is has that happened? Well yes, it has happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the nationwide ground stop last Thursday the price of Bitcoin has shot up about 20%. Is that a coincidence?\u201d he added.\n\nWhile Tucker\u2019s fanbase online appears to believe the theory is plausible, it was less well-received by the crypto community. Nick Almond, the founder of FactoryDAO, described Tucker\u2019s wild theory as \u201cmaximum tin foil\u201d to his 13,500 Twitter followers:\n\nAlmond replied to supporters of the theory that he doubted very highly that the U.S. government would buy billions in Bitcoin on the open market to pay for the ransoms.\n\nBlockstream CEO and cypherpunk Adam Back also mocked Carlson to his 506,000 Twitter followers, stating that the two events were exactly what Carlson described them to be \u2014 a coincidence:\n\n\"is that a coincidence?\", yes, it is a coincidence. lols. \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) January 17, 2023\n\nOther arguments made against the theory on Crypto Twitter included that the U.S. government already has a large amount of confiscated Bitcoin, that the government would buy it over-the-counter if it did buy it, and thaas Bitcoin is traceable and transparent, large ransoms are more likely to be paid in Monero.\n\nStack Hodler pointed out to his 30,000 followers that the recovery of $5 billionin assets by FTX was a more likely explanation for the recovery in crypto markets:\n\nMorning of Jan 11: All flights grounded in US due to a \"critical tech outage\"\n\n\n\nAfternoon of Jan 11: FTX says it has recovered more than $5 Billion worth of cash\n\n\n\nTucker Carlson: Did the US government buy Bitcoin for a ransom?\n\n\n\nCan you imagine... https://t.co/Bng9VfxHHU pic.twitter.com/VzwbSdt3s9 \u2014 Stack Hodler (@stackhodler) January 17, 2023\n\nMore than 1,300 flights were cancelled with an additional 10,000 flights being delayed in the first two days of the disruption.\n\nRelated: Ripple CTO shuts down ChatGPT\u2019s XRP conspiracy theory\n\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration stated on Jan. 11 that the disruption was caused by a \u201cdamaged database file\u201d in its Notice to Air Mission system, which the agency said was not harmed by a cyberattack.\n\nThe issue has been fixed and flights have resumed normal operations."

        "title": "Bitcoin rally shows cryptocurrency resilience after FTX debacle - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "The recent bitcoin price rally, combined with last year\u2019s lackluster returns for so-called safe investments, is drawing new attention to the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWhile the flagship cryptocurrency is still down more than 65% from its all-time high in November 2021, it has enjoyed a 26% spike over the past 30 days, including a 22% price increase over the past week.\n\n\u201cThis looks to be a real rebound,\u201d said Tyrone Ross, chief executive and co-founder of Turnqey Labs and principal at 401 Financial.\n\n\u201cVolume is strong and it\u2019s moving back to the 200-day moving averages,\u201d Ross said. \u201cIt also helps that inflation and dollar strength have abated a bit, but all of that can change swiftly. I think this will be a choppy year with some face-ripping rallies in-between, driven largely by the global macro environment.\u201d\n\nInvestment proxies for bitcoin are also getting caught up in the recent activity, which some analysts are saying represents a market that\u2019s already moving past the FTX debacle.\n\n\u201cThere has been some renewed interest in crypto ETFs after the bitcoin rally,\u201d said Roxanna Islam, associate director of research at VettaFi.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just true for crypto investments but also for broader blockchain investments that are growth- or tech-oriented,\u201d Islam said. \u201cThere is also some normalization of bitcoin prices after the initial shock of the FTX fallout. Most crypto ETFs are now back to prices seen before the FTX collapse.\u201d\n\nIslam cited as an example the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which is up 26.6% from where it was trading on Nov. 11 when FTX declared bankruptcy. \u201cWhile this fund saw over $18 million in outflows in the past month, there has already been almost $2.8 million in inflows during the past week,\u201d she said.\n\nCrypto mining stocks have also come charging back, as is illustrated by the 75% gain posted so far this year by the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI).\n\nA more concentrated look at crypto miners comes via Marathon Digital Holding (MARA), which is up 125% from the start of the year but is still saddled with a 73% decline over the past 12 months.\n\n\u201cCrypto mining stocks had a particularly rough few months compared to other crypto stocks because of rising energy costs,\u201d Islam said. \u201cRecently, some crypto mining stocks have seen some recovery as some companies take steps to restructure or avoid bankruptcy proceedings.\u201d\n\nRic Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, said it\u2019s too early to says that the bitcoin rally represents \u201cthe end of the crypto winter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat question remains very much open,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cIt could be a dead-cat bounce or it could be investors being too euphoric too quickly. But it does show that the crypto market is alive and well.\u201d\n\nLooking beyond the spike over the past few weeks or the incidents of fraud over the past several months, Edelman is locked into the idea of bitcoin charging toward record highs over the next two years.\n\n\u201cMuch of the malaise and fraud that took place in 2022 had nothing to do with the development of blockchain,\u201d he said. \u201cThose incidents do not undermine the legitimacy of the technology that crypto represents.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the price of bitcoin remained relatively stable throughout most of last year amid some high-profile cryptocurrency scandals should be viewed as positive, Edelman said. \u201cAs we enter 2023, people are beginning to refocus and remind themselves that the fundamental premise of blockchain technology remains as real as ever.\u201d\n\nEdelman is looking to 2024 and beyond, with history as a guide.\n\nAccording to the schedule that halves the bitcoin payment to miners every four years, that payment will be cut to 3 1/8 bitcoins next year.\n\n\u201cHistory tells us, every time the bitcoin mining reward is cut in half the price [eventually] doubles to maintain the value of the reward,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cIf you do the math and look based on historical levels of what happened in the 18 months following the [halving], the price of bitcoin reaches new highs of a 10 times increase over the prior price.\u201d\n\nThat math and that schedule put the price of Bitcoin at roughly $150,000 in the summer of 2025, or approximately 580% above the current price.\n\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s not an assurance,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cBut many people are confident that the upcoming [halving] will be reflected in a new era of prosperity for crypto.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin on-chain and technical data begin to suggest that the BTC price bottom is in - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price has followed a four-year cycle, with consecutive bull and bear trends occurring in somewhat measurable intervals. A closer look at Bitcoin\u2019s long-term price action reveals that the run-up to the top and bottom of the previous cycles look remarkably similar. What\u2019s more interesting is that the 2020\u20132021 cycle shows signs of following the same pattern.\n\nIndependent market analyst HornHarris found that the period between the bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom has been the same since 2015: 152 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively.\n\nEven in 2013, the bear market lasted 58 weeks, only a six-week difference from the other two cycles.\n\nBitcoin price chart with timelines of past cycles. Source: Twitter\n\nAnother resemblance with the last bottom formation is the similarity between Bitcoin\u2019s current uptrend and the one in 2019, when the primary catalyst was prevalent negative investor sentiment. Bitcoin price gained nearly 350% from the bottom of $3,125, and it didn\u2019t drop below this level moving forward, marking the previous cycle\u2019s bottom.\n\nFour years later, the conditions have changed, but the underlying reason for the latest 30% surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price was still the market expecting lower prices due to macroeconomic headwinds. The lack of positive sentiment and build-up of short positions in the futures market may have allowed buyers to stage a disbelief rally to hunt short-order liquidations and incite FOMO \u2014 fear of missing out \u2014 among investors who had been sitting on the sidelines.\n\nBut not all conditions are the same. Previously, BTC whales \u2014 addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC \u2014 went on a buying spree as Bitcoin\u2019s price started to bottom out. However, these buyers haven\u2019t participated in the recent rally, raising concerns about its sustainability.\n\nIf history repeats itself, Bitcoin\u2019s November 2022 lows of around $15,500 will mark the bottom of the current cycle. It would also mean that a new bullish cycle has begun, and the asset could record a new peak in October 2025.\n\nNumber of addresses with more than 1,000 BTC. Source: Glassnode\n\nIt will be interesting to see if whale buyers buy the Federal Reserve\u2019s theory under Jerome Powell that it\u2019s pulling off a successful soft landing instead of a recession as a result of its flight against inflation. December\u2019s economic data on consumer price inflation and employment numbers showed early signs of macro improvement. A few other on-chain indicators could help confirm whether this bull run is the real deal.\n\nShort-term bullish reversal signs appear\n\nBitcoin has been trading around bargain purchase levels for quite some time on the longer timeframes. In the short-term, however, the risk of price dropping to new lows was high due to miner selling pressure, macroeconomic headwind, and the fear of FTX contagion. The recent rally shows signs of on-chain signals moving into bullish territory.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s realized price metric reflects buyers\u2019 average price on moving the coins on-chain. Its price dropped below its realized price only three times in the last eight years. Moreover, a breakout above this level has marked the end of the bearish trend in each of them.\n\nCurrently, the realized price of Bitcoin sits at $19,715. If the price holds above this level, it will encourage buyers sitting on the sidelines to join the rally.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s on-chain Realized Price (yellow) and market price (black). Source: Glassnode\n\nAnother reliable short-term on-chain indicator is Spend Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). It measures the profitability of Bitcoin transactions based on the price of tokens when they are added and withdrawn from specific addresses.\n\nThe indicator is used to identify bullish and bearish trends. When the price is in an uptrend, investors add to their winning positions during pullbacks, indicated when the SOPR indicator\u2019s value stays above one. The inverse happens in a bear: Bears dominate the market by selling into rallies. Thus, a crossover of the metric above the pivot at one is a potent trend reversal signal.\n\nSo far, the seven-day average transactions are still occurring at a loss, but the price is very close to flipping bullish. Based on the last retest of SOPR\u2019s pivot, the bullish reversal will happen after a successful weekly close above $21,200.\n\nEntry adjusted SOPR. Source: Glassnode\n\nAnother notable development has occurred with Bitcoin miners, who were one of the most significant sellers in 2022 as the market price dropped below the production cost of Bitcoin, putting pressure on them. However, the days of miner capitulation are likely behind.\n\nThe Hash Ribbon indicator, developed by on-chain analyst Charles Edwards, flashed a buy signal, suggesting an end to the trend of dropping hash rates, with prices recovering above production costs of large- to medium-scale enterprises.\n\nUnless Bitcoin price drops below $20,000 in the near future, the market can expect miners to start accumulating Bitcoin instead of having to sell the entire amount to cover operation costs.\n\nThe stark similarities between Bitcoin\u2019s previous cycles and a relief from the ongoing miner sell-off should aid buyers in building a long-term bullish support level.\n\nHowever, the lack of whale buying and the price reversing from the SOPR pivot level around $21,200 raises a few alarms that the sellers may start to dominate again. The on-chain support level for buyers lies around the realized price at $19,715.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "New York faces a new legal fight over a proposed crypto-mining power plant - The Verge",
        "content": "Environmental groups are pushing New York state to scrutinize a crypto mining company\u2019s purchase of a gas-fired power plant, contending in a new lawsuit that turning the power plant into a crypto mine would go against the state\u2019s climate goals and dump more pollution on nearby neighborhoods.\n\nSierra Club and the Clean Air Coalition of Western New York filed a suit on Friday that challenges the New York Public Service Commission\u2019s (PSC) approval of the sale. Under state law, the commission has to give the green light before the transfer of ownership of a power plant can take place. Until now, the commission has mostly focused on whether such a sale would affect residents\u2019 electricity rates or create a monopoly. The commission needs to start taking climate change and environmental injustice into consideration because of a sweeping climate law passed in 2019, the new lawsuit argues.\n\n\u201cThe law says you can\u2019t just ignore these really serious consequences\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law says you can\u2019t just ignore these really serious consequences,\u201d says Dror Ladin, senior attorney at Earthjustice, the nonprofit environmental law group representing the plaintiffs. \u201cRunning the plant 24 hours a day to mine crypto is going to be very bad both for the climate and for and for people in the area.\u201d\n\nThe power plant, called Fortistar, is in the small city of North Tonawanda, located between Buffalo and Niagara Falls. Typically, Fortistar is used as a so-called \u201cpeaker plant,\u201d firing up infrequently to meet peak electricity demand during an energy crunch. The plant has only been in operation between 10 and 25 days a year since 2017, according to Environmental Protection Agency records cited in the complaint. That schedule is expected to change drastically if Canadian crypto mining company Digihost moves in, which is why some residents are worried about their potential new neighbor.\n\nDigihost petitioned the PSC to approve the purchase of Fortistar back in April 2021. It planned to run the plant \u201c24/7\u201d to power its crypto mining rigs, according to an environmental assessment form the company filed to North Tonawanda later that year. Crypto companies burn through enormous amounts of electricity to mine Bitcoin, more than many small countries use in a single year. To validate new transactions on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain and earn new tokens in return, \u201cminers\u201d have to solve difficult computational puzzles using specialized hardware. The more hardware you have and energy you use, the better your chances of earning new tokens.\n\nThat happens to produce a lot of pollution in the process \u2014 especially for operations that get all their electricity from a gas-fired plant like Fortistar. So some nearby residents worry that if Fortistar starts running 24/7, that would increase its environmental footprint.\n\n\u201cMy oldest son has asthma and I worry about how the pollution will affect him,\u201d one resident who lives about a quarter mile from the gas plant writes in an affidavit accompanying the environmental groups\u2019 complaint. \u201cI have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and I\u2019m also worried that increased pollution will worsen my condition.\u201d\n\nNew York also has its climate goals to consider. The state has committed to slashing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 85 percent by 2050. To achieve that goal, the climate law it passed in 2019 mandates that state agencies consider whether its decisions would endanger those goals or disproportionately burden \u201cdisadvantaged communities.\u201d While the state is still finalizing criteria for what makes a community \u201cdisadvantaged,\u201d some census tracts near Fortistar have already been found to cope with more pollution than 90 percent of the state.\n\nNevertheless, New York\u2019s Public Service Commission approved Digihost\u2019s petition to purchase the plant in September 2022. \u201cWhile numerous commenters raise significant environmental concerns ... these matters are beyond the scope of the limited review undertaken in this proceeding,\u201d the PSC wrote in its decision.\n\nThe suit filed Friday is the first to push the PSC to broaden the scope of its decision-making, citing New York\u2019s climate law. If the environmental groups are successful, the commission would have to rethink its approval of Digihost\u2019s planned takeover of the plant. At that point, Digihost could have a tough time convincing the state that its new crypto mine wouldn\u2019t imperil climate goals.\n\nIn a similar fight over a crypto-mining power plant in New York called Greenidge, the state\u2019s Department of Conservation denied air permits because its operations \u201cwould be inconsistent with the statewide greenhouse gas emission limits established in the Climate Act.\u201d In November, Governor Kathy Hochul signed a two-year moratorium on new permits for fossil fuel power plants seeking to mine Bitcoin. That gives the state time to conduct an environmental impact review of crypto mining more broadly.\n\nBoth Greenidge and Fortisar are excluded from that moratorium because they had applied for air permits before the law was passed. Greenidge is still up and running as it appeals the state\u2019s decision on its air permit. But environmental advocates are optimistic they might be able to keep a crypto mine at Fortistar from getting off the ground at all."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), could grow by 35% versus Bitcoin (BTC) this year to hit 0.1 BTC for the first time since 2018 as it forms a classic bullish continuation pattern.\n\nEthereum price must first break key resistance\n\nDubbed an ascending triangle, the pattern forms when the price fluctuates inside a range defined by rising trendline support and horizontal trendline resistance. It typically resolves after the price breaks out in the direction of its previous trend.\n\nOn a weekly chart, the ETH/BTC pair has been painting an ascending pattern since May 2021. The Ethereum token eyes a breakout above the pattern's horizontal trendline resistance near 0.0776 BTC. Breaking this level could then see the price rally by as much as the triangle's maximum height.\n\nIn other words, the ETH/BTC pair could reach the next big resistance level at 0.1 BTC in 2023, or 35% from the current price levels.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nNonetheless, it is important to mention that ETH/BTC has attempted to break above the triangle's resistance trendline eight times since May 2021. The attempts included two major breakouts in November 2021 and September 2022, which saw the pair rallying 14% and 9%, respectively.\n\nBoth rallies fizzled out inside the 0.082 to 0.085 BTC area, followed by extreme price corrections that took ETH/BTC back inside the triangle range. Given this multi-year hurdle, the pair could face stiff resistance inside the 0.082 to 0.085 BTC range, even if it breaks above the triangle.\n\nSuch a move would risk crashing ETH toward the triangle support, which coincides with its 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA), represented by the red line in the chart above, near 0.070 BTC, down nearly 6% from the current price levels.\n\nETH \"deflation\" narrative\n\nEther\u2019s bullish setup versus Bitcoin appears as ETH dominance has doubled versus other crypto assets in the past few years.\n\nNotably, ETH\u2019s market capitalization has risen to nearly 20.5% of the entire crypto market valuation in January 2023, from about 10% in December 2020, when the Ethereum network started its transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) with the launch of a dedicated staking smart contract.\n\nETH.D weekly performance chart.

And second, the Ethereum network has started burning some transaction fees.\n\nRelated: Ethereum \u2018shark\u2019 accumulation, Shanghai hard fork put $2K ETH price in play\n\nBoth changes have had a deflationary impact on overall supply. As a result, the Ethereum network now regularly produces fewer Ether tokens than are taken out of circulation, which theoretically makes ETH a \u201cdeflationary\u201d asset.\n\nETH supply change since the Ethereum PoS upgrade in September 2022.

        "title": "Merkle Tree in Blockchain: What is it and How does it work - Simplilearn",
        "content": "A hash tree, also known as a Merkle tree, is a tree in which each leaf node is labeled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and each non-leaf node is labeled with the cryptographic hash of its child nodes' labels. The majority of hash tree implementations are binary (each node has two child nodes), but they can also have many more child nodes.\n\nBut what actually is the Merkle tree in Blockchain, and how it is used in Blockchain? So, if you want to know the answer to all these questions, then you are in the right place.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat Is a Merkle Tree?\n\nMerkle trees, also known as Binary hash trees, are a prevalent sort of data structure in computer science.\n\nIn bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, they're used to encrypt blockchain data more efficiently and securely.\n\nIt's a mathematical data structure made up of hashes of various data blocks that summarize all the transactions in a block.\n\nIt also enables quick and secure content verification across big datasets and verifies the consistency and content of the data.\n\nWhat Is a Merkle Root?\n\nA Merkle root is a simple mathematical method for confirming the facts on a Merkle tree.\n\nThey're used in cryptocurrency to ensure that data blocks sent through a peer-to-peer network are whole, undamaged, and unaltered.\n\nThey play a very crucial role in the computation required to keep cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether running.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nCryptographic Hash Functions\n\nA hash function maps any type of arbitrary data of any length to a fixed-size output. It is commonly used in cryptography since it is a cryptographic function.\n\nThey are efficient and are well-known for one property: they are irreversible. It's a one-way function that's only meant to work in one direction.\n\nSome of the Hash families available are Message Direct (MD), Secure Hash Function (SHF), and RIPE Message Direct (RIPEMD).\n\nNow, take an example, if you use the SHA256 hash algorithm and pass 101Blockchains as input, you will get the following output\n\nfbffd63a60374a31aa9811cbc80b577e23925a5874e86a17f712bab874f33ac9\n\nIn conclusion, these are the following key properties of the hash function:\n\nDeterministic\n\nPre-Image Resistant\n\nComputationally Efficient\n\nCannot be Reversed Engineered\n\nCollision Resistant\n\nWorking of Merkle Trees\n\nA Merkle tree totals all transactions in a block and generates a digital fingerprint of the entire set of operations, allowing the user to verify whether it includes a transaction in the block.\n\nMerkle trees are made by hashing pairs of nodes repeatedly until only one hash remains; this hash is known as the Merkle Root or the Root Hash.\n\nThey're built from the bottom, using Transaction IDs, which are hashes of individual transactions.\n\nEach non-leaf node is a hash of its previous hash, and every leaf node is a hash of transactional data.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nNow, look at a little example of a Merkle Tree in Blockchain to help you understand the concept.\n\nConsider the following scenario: A, B, C, and D are four transactions, all executed on the same block. Each transaction is then hashed, leaving you with:\n\nHash A\n\nHash B\n\nHash C\n\nHash D\n\nThe hashes are paired together, resulting in:\n\nHash AB\n\nand\n\nHash CD\n\nAnd therefore, your Merkle Root is formed by combining these two hashes: Hash ABCD.\n\nIn reality, a Merkle Tree is much more complicated (especially when each transaction ID is 64 characters long). Still, this example helps you have a good overview of how the algorithms work and why they are so effective.\n\nBenefits of Merkle Tree in Blockchain\n\nMerkle trees provide four significant advantages -\n\nValidate the data's integrity: It can be used to validate the data's integrity effectively.\n\nTakes little disk space: Compared to other data structures, the Merkle tree takes up very little disk space.\n\nTiny information across networks: Merkle trees can be broken down into small pieces of data for verification.\n\nEfficient Verification: The data format is efficient, and verifying the data's integrity takes only a few moments.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhy Is It Essential to Blockchain?\n\nThink of a blockchain without Merkle Trees to get a sense of how vital they are for blockchain technology. Let\u2019s have one of Bitcoin because its use of Merkle Trees is essential for the cryptocurrency and easier to grasp.\n\nIf Bitcoin didn't include Merkle Trees, per se, every node on the network would have to retain a complete copy of every single Bitcoin transaction ever made. One can imagine how much information that would be.\n\nAny authentication request on Bitcoin would require an enormous amount of data to be transferred over the network: therefore, you'll need to validate the data on your own.\n\nTo confirm that there were no modifications, a computer used for validation would need a lot of computing power to compare ledgers.\n\nMerkle Trees are a solution to this issue. They hash records in accounting, thereby separating the proof of data from the data itself.\n\nProving that giving tiny amounts of information across the network is all that is required for a transaction to be valid.\n\nFurthermore, it enables you to demonstrate that both ledger variations are identical in terms of nominal computer power and network bandwidth.\n\nUse-Cases of Merkle Tree in Blockchain\n\nThere are more Merkle tree implementations out there.\n\nGit, a distributed version control system, is one of the most widely used. It is used to handle projects by programmers from all around the world.\n\nInterplanetary File System, a peer-to-peer distributed protocol, is another suitable implementation. It's also open-source, allowing computers to join and use a centralized file system.\n\nIt's part of the technique that generates verifiable certificate transparency logs.\n\nAmazon DynamoDB and Apache Cassandra use it during the data replication process. These No-SQL distributed databases use Merkle trees to control discrepancies.\n\nDecipher the global craze surrounding Blockchain with the Blockchain Certification Training Course. Get trained today.\n\nConclusion\n\nMerkle Tree is an essential fundamental of Blockchain technology, enabling its growth in the IT World. Simplilearn's Blockchain Certification Training was designed for developers who want to decipher the global craze surrounding Blockchain, Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and many other technologies like Merkle Tree. You'll learn the core structure and technical mechanisms of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger, Dogecoin, and Multichain Blockchain platforms and their underlying technologies.\n\nHope you liked the tutorial on Merkle Tree in Blockchain, in case of any doubts, please ask your questions in the comment section below."

        "content": "The Bitcoin (BTC) price rebound to a multi-month high has also positively affected mining stocks. Many crypto-mining stocks recorded their best monthly performance in a year. The surge in mining stocks also relieved the troubled miners who had to sell a significant chunk of their mined coins to boost liquidity in 2022.\n\nBitfarms \u2014 one of the top BTC mining firms \u2014 registered a 140% surge in the first two weeks of January 2023, followed by Marathon Digital Holdings with a 120% surge. Hive Blockchain Technologies saw its stock value nearly double in the same period, while the MVIS Global Digital Assets Mining Index is up by 64% in the first month of the new year.\n\nThe Luxor Hashprice Index, which aims to quantify how much a miner might make from the processing power used by the Bitcoin network, has increased by 21% this year. This partly reflects larger rewards due to an increase in the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe bull run in 2021 prompted several mining companies to go public while others invested heavily in equipment and expansion. However, a prolonged crypto winter in 2022 exposed the vulnerabilities and lack of proper structuring in many of these mining firms.\n\nRelated: Samsung investment arm to launch Bitcoin Futures ETF amid rising crypto interest\n\nThe 2021 bull market saw a significant increase in borrowing by the Bitcoin mining industry, which had a negative effect on their financial standing during the ensuing bear market.

By the end of 2022, leading BTC miners such as Core Scientific filed for bankruptcy.\n\nLiabilities of public Bitcoin mining companies.

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies are experiencing their worst crisis since the arrival of the first crypto assets and virtual currencies in the 1990s and their democratization in the 2010s.\n\nBitcoin had an unprecedented tumble in late 2020 and has yet to recover. In addition to this sharp decline, there is much discussion about the worrisome collapse of some so-called stablecoins, which are supposed to be less volatile.\n\nThis is compounded by the fall of cryptocurrency giants, particularly due to allegations of fraud in cases like the FTX scandal. At its peak, FTX had one million users and was the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of volume.\n\nExperts agree that the aftershocks of its collapse have hit investors hard and will likely slow the pace of crypto asset adoption for the next few years.\n\nRead more: Investir dans les cryptoactifs : voici comment limiter le risque d\u2019\u00eatre expos\u00e9 \u00e0 une fraude\n\nAs an expert in the field of cryptocurrencies, I will try to answer the following question: are cryptocurrencies really here to stay, or are they just a fad?\n\nSpeculation and extreme volatility\n\nCryptoassets include tokens that can be used for digital currency purposes (i.e. cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum). They are also used for investment in an entity (a \u201csecurity token,\u201d which entitles the holder to ownership of a portion of an entity), or for products or services (a \u201cutility token,\u201d which entitles the holder to a product once it has been produced, for example).\n\nStablecoins, which are supposed to be associated with lower volatility, are unique in that they are backed by a currency (e.g. the U.S. dollar), a commodity (e.g. gold) or a financial instrument (e.g. a stock or a bond). This is to keep the value of the digital currency stable.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s plunge is followed in the headlines on a daily basis. While this is not the first time it has fallen, it is particularly noteworthy as it is the biggest drop in value since late 2020. The collapse is partly due to rising interest rates and the flight of investors from these risky investments. Although it is recovering, Bitcoin is still a long way from the heights it once reached.\n\nThis media coverage raises many questions about the sustainability of these cryptoassets. Indeed, the latter are marked by extreme volatility in their unregulated markets in addition to being associated with speculation by many players in the financial world.\n\nIndeed, the BBC recently reported that cryptocurrency laundering rose 30 per cent in 2021. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which aims to protect U.S. consumers, reported that in 2021, fraud schemes cost investors more than $1 billion in cryptocurrencies. Needless to say, very few of the defrauded investors have recovered their money.\n\nOne billion users by 2022\n\nYet we are seeing a slow but sure increase in the adoption of cryptocurrencies by companies. In an ongoing study of the impact of cryptocurrency adoption by public companies on their social responsibility, I noted that many of them, such as Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s, have started to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. This is particularly the case in their branches in El Salvador, following that country\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nOthers, such as Japanese online retail giant Rakuten, have chosen to accept cryptocurrencies even if their country is not pushing to adopt Bitcoin as a currency. They say they are driven by a desire to offer more payment options to their customers.\n\nThe user base for cryptocurrencies is growing year on year. For example, Crypto.com, an exchange platform, estimated that about 295 million people had entered the cryptocurrency market as of December 2021. The platform expected the number of users to cross the one billion mark by December 2022.\n\nCryptocurrencies also allow people with unreliable or insecure banking systems to access a parallel banking system that is independent of the traditional banking system. Offering a less affluent part of the population access to a different form of banking system is one of the reasons the President of El Salvador gave for making Bitcoin legal tender in the country.\n\nA healthy fluctuation\n\nThe growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), as well as the development of the metaverse, are also factors that influence the sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Decentralized finance often relies on stablecoins for its operation. Meanwhile, the metaverse, a universe of 3D virtual worlds, also allows the use of cryptocurrencies to purchase goods or services, creating an immersive world.\n\nExperts in the sector believe that, despite the debacle that the cryptoasset market has experienced recently, decentralized finance \u2014 particularly via products backed by cryptoassets \u2014 is here to stay. This is because there is a market and players willing to participate.\n\nMoreover, they argue that while this sharp decline in cryptocurrency-related markets does remove some players, this is a welcome change. By the admission of Raoul Ullens, co-founder of Brussels Blockchain Week (an annual conference devoted to blockchain and cryptocurrencies):\n\nit is healthy, for the adoption, the maturation of these Web3 technologies, to skim, to rebalance the sector. [\u2026] An unhealthy ecosystem will not attract the masses.\n\nAccording to these players, such a drop in the cryptoasset markets is not only necessary, but also healthy, contributing as it does to rebalancing the valuation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptocurrencies are here to stay\n\nThe launch of cryptocurrencies by central banks, via central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), also lends weight to the argument that cryptoassets are here to stay. Indeed, the Bank of Canada is currently working on the creation of a CBDC. According to the institution, a CBDC issued by the Bank of Canada would be an \u201cofficial digital currency (that) would retain its face value in Canadian dollars because it is issued by the Bank of Canada, just like bank notes.\u201d\n\nOther nations in the world have already issued such a currency, including the Bahamas (Sand Dollar) and Nigeria (eNaira). One reason CBDCs are different from privately issued digital currencies (such as Bitcoin or Ethereum) is that their intended use is for transaction purposes only, not for investment or speculation. They offer the same possibilities of use as cash.\n\nCBDCs also aim to promote the financial inclusion of a part of the population that has little or no access to the traditional banking system, and to simplify the implementation of monetary and fiscal policy in the issuing countries.\n\nDevelopments in the world of digital currencies, whether in the metaverse or with the arrival of the CBDC, and the craze that they continue to generate, mean cryptocurrency is here to stay.\n\nThis durability means the form of cryptoassets take will continue to evolve and transform with the technologies that support them (notably, blockchains) and the variation in demand from users and/or investors."

        "content": "A handful of big players pull all the strings when it comes to the cryptocurrency market.\n\nA handful of big players pull all the strings when it comes to the cryptocurrency market. Credit: GETTY\n\nWe're not just a couple of weeks into 2023 and crypto prices are spiking. Seeing number go up might entice you to throw some money into Bitcoin or Ethereum. After all, maybe this is the beginning of another crypto bull market? You wouldn't want to miss out!\n\nWell, just wait a minute. Consider this first: Why are crypto prices suddenly rising?\n\nThere are plenty of analysts out there trying to make logical sense of the recent bump in cryptocurrencies value \u2013 inflation is slowing , belief that the Federal Reserve is done with hiking interest rate hiking, bullish news on crypto \u2013 but no, that's not really it.\n\nThere's been no big positive news in the industry. There aren't reports of some new, mainstream avenues of adoption. Sure, the stock market is up a bit right now in the new year, but not at the same level cryptocurrency is.\n\nSo, what's going on here? Market manipulation.\n\nBitcoin is riding high, but isn't heading to the moon anytime soon\n\nBitcoin is hovering over $21,000 as of mid-January, a price that has not been seen since early November 2022. That was before the collapse of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world. Crypto took a pounding in 2022, as major stablecoins, lenders, and other crypto companies failed, causing domino effects throughout the industry.\n\nHowever, things are not looking up. Even though one of the most tumultuous years for crypto is behind us, 2023 thus far has not treated crypto much better with the failure of Gemini Earn and crypto lender Nexo's offices being raided over allegations of illegal activity. There's no good news on the horizon. In addition, the majority of retail inventors now view cryptocurrency as too risky , so who's buying?\n\nAs longtime cryptocurrency writer and critic David Gerard explains: The big players in the industry are \"buying\" in order to control the market.\n\n\"The bitcoin price is whatever the large players need it to be,\" writes Gerard. \"The market is very thin and trivially manipulable with the billions of pseudo-dollars in unbacked stablecoins on the unregulated offshore exchanges. The price needs to be high enough so the big boys' loans don't get liquidated; but it needs to be low enough so that the bagholders don't attempt to cash out.\"\n\nJohn Reed Stark, a former SEC official, concurred with Gerard's assessment.\n\n\"\u200b\u200bA recent Forbes analysis of 157 crypto exchanges found that 51 percent of daily bitcoin trading volume being reported was likely bogus,\" tweeted Stark, referring to a Forbes report from last summer.\n\nWho is doing the buying? It's not clear\n\nA more recent study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that \"wash trades accounted for up to 70 percent of all transactions on non-compliant crypto exchanges, suggesting most trades on these platforms are fraudulent.\"\n\nWash trading is basically when an investor trades with itself in order to make it look like there is activity in the market in order to boost value. Basically, it's market manipulation.\n\nSo when you hear investment advice from people like Anthony Scaramucci, the guy who worked as communication director for Trump's White House for about 10 days in 2017, proceed with caution. Scaramucci now heads up an investment firm called SkyBridge Capital and recently told CNBC that 2023 will be a \"recovery year\" for Bitcoin, with prices skyrocketing backup to new highs in two or three years.\n\nIt's important to note that 30 percent of SkyBridge Capital was bought out by FTX about two months before the exchange collapsed. The firm made significant crypto investments with the tens of millions from that deal, right before crypto tanked even further. Scaramucci recently said that he's hoping that SkyBridge can buy back the stake it sold to FTX. So, it's not too shocking for Scaramucci to be putting \"good vibes\" out there for crypto so the firm can make a return on their investments.\n\nIt's just yet another way the big crypto companies and investment funds manipulate the market."

Circle, the company behind the stablecoin USDC, was one the few present.\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Over the past few years at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the number of cryptocurrency industry attendees has boomed.\n\nBut after a near $1.4 trillion wipeout in 2022, the crypto industry is being a bit more reserved with how it splashes the cash and several companies spotted last year are not in attendance. 2022 was marked by failed crypto projects, liquidity issues and bankruptcies, topped off by the collapse of major exchange FTX.\n\nWhen the World Economic Forum was held last May, bitcoin was hovering around $30,000, after having already fallen more than 50% from its all-time high hit in November 2021. More pain followed with bitcoin dipping as low as $15,480.\n\nThe Promenade is the main street in Davos where companies and governments take over shops and cafes for the week. Last year, crypto firms from all walks of life took over the place. But since the market slide, there are far fewer crypto firms with flashy store fronts at Davos.\n\nOne shop selling non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, has disappeared. Prices of NFTs, which are digital collectibles, also plunged last year. What's left are companies that survived the bear market and that are looking to expand their businesses.\n\n\"It's very clear that the speculation period is drawing to a close and every company that you see featured \u2026 is really focused on real-world use cases,\" said Teana Baker-Taylor, vice-president of policy and regulatory strategy at Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin."

        "title": "Is the Bitcoin price spike a bull trap? - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent price action has left crypto investors and traders pleasantly surprised. After hovering within the $16,000 to $17,000 range for nearly a month, BTC jumped 20 percent over the last week. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation marched from $16,997 on January 13 to $21,224 on January 16.\n\nThis price spike filled the market with hope, especially after the disastrous events of 2023. However, several prominent traders and analysts believe that the recent upward trend is nothing but a bull trap that will cause pain for those who jump onto the BTC bandwagon at current prices. But what is a bull trap and why do experts think that Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally classifies as one? Tag along to find out.\n\nBull traps: What are they?\n\nA bull trap refers to an upward trend that deceives investors into thinking that a certain asset is headed for further gains when it is actually going to drop. Such a price action usually occurs when a cryptocurrency undergoes random and rapid price increases. Market participants see the rise as an opportunity to buy in, believing that the trend will continue. However, the price suddenly drops, and investors are trapped with glaring losses.\n\nBull traps are characterised by sudden price spikes, accompanied by low trading volumes, overbought indicators and negative market sentiment. At the time of writing, BTC\u2019s trading volume was down 4.87 percent over the last 24 hours and its RSI was 71.57, which is generally considered \u201coverbought.\u201d Moreover, while the digital asset market is in the green since the start of the New Year, the crypto winter still rages on and several web3 firms are feeling the cold. Plenty of large companies have even announced job cuts this month.\n\nConditions like these have led many prominent traders, analysts and investors to believe that BTC\u2019s current price rally is indeed a bull trap. For instance, popular crypto analyst, Il Capo Of Crypto, referred to the BTC spike as one of the \u201cbiggest bull traps\u201d he had ever seen. In the same Twitter thread, Il Capo also validated his opinion through a host of technical indicators and other market factors.\n\n\"This is the bull trap I was speaking about,\" said another prominent analyst, Toni Ghinea, on Jan 14, just as BTC began its march to $21,000. According to Ghinea, BTC will drop to $14,000 in the coming months. On the other hand, Il Capo believes BTC will plummet to $12,000 before the bulls can take over. And it\u2019s not just experts. Even regular traders and investors believe that BTC is currently a bull trap. As per a CoinTelegraph Twitter Poll, more than 60 percent of 5,000 voters believe that the current rally is a bull trap.\n\nThere are optimistic investors and traders too\n\nNot all experts agree with the bull trap theory. Some believe that BTC experienced a genuine uptrend last week and that it could continue to reach new heights in 2023. For instance, on Jan 5, prominent venture capitalist, Tim Draper, stated that BTC could touch $250,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nProfessor of finance at Sussex University, Carol Alexander, believes that BTC is headed for $30,000 by Q1 of 2023. \u201cThere will be a managed bull market in 2023, not a bubble \u2014 so we won\u2019t see the price overshooting as before,\u201d Carol told CNBC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see a month or two of stable trending prices interspersed with range-bounded periods and probably a couple of short-lived crashes,\u201d she added. Carol believes that BTC will touch $50,000 by the end of the year.\n\nMoreover, a machine learning tool designed by PricePredictions states that BTC will maintain its valuation in Feb. The model predicts that Bitcoin will stay its course around the $21,000 mark going into the next month and continue growing from there.\n\nIn addition, several technical indicators also point towards a breakout in the coming months. For instance, according to TradingView, BTC is forming a falling wedge pattern, a bullish signs that\u2019s often followed by a breakout. Further, the platform\u2019s technical meter points to \u201cbuy\u201d for Bitcoin at the moment. Further, several of Bitcoin\u2019s moving average indicators also point to a \u201cstrong buy\u201d. Finally, BTC has managed to hover within the $21,000 range over the last couple of days, indicating support at this price level.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell where BTC is headed next. Several analyst and technical indicators point one way, while another set of experts and indicators tell us something else altogether. However, with halving approaching us in 2024, Bitcoin should see a rise as the number of coins entering circulation slows and supply becomes scarce. However, until then, all we can do is wait and watch. Bitcoin was trading at $21,216 at the time of writing, up 1.86 percent over the last 24 hours."

        "content": "When it comes to playing poker with cryptocurrencies, there are several popular digital currencies that have gained recognition and acceptance within the online poker community. These cryptocurrencies offer unique features and advantages that make them attractive options for players. Let\u2019s take a look:\n\n1. Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin is the original and most well-known cryptocurrency and carries the highest value. It is widely accepted in the online poker community and offers secure and anonymous transactions. Bitcoin\u2019s large user base makes it a popular choice for crypto poker players and there are a number of great Bitcoin poker sites to choose from.\n\n2. Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used for transactions within the Ethereum network and is also accepted by many crypto poker sites. Ethereum\u2019s flexibility and programmability open up possibilities for innovative features and game mechanics in crypto poker.\n\n3. Litecoin (LTC)\n\nLitecoin is often considered the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold. It offers faster transaction confirmation times and a different hashing algorithm, making it more accessible for smaller transactions. Many online poker sites accept Litecoin, providing players with a reliable and efficient alternative to Bitcoin.\n\n4. Ripple (XRP)\n\nRipple is a digital payment protocol that facilitates fast, low-cost international money transfers. While not as widely supported in the crypto poker community as Bitcoin or Ethereum, some platforms accept Ripple as a form of payment. Ripple\u2019s focus on facilitating seamless cross-border transactions may appeal to players looking for quick and cost-effective transfers.\n\n5. Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\n\nBitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that emerged as a result of a hard fork from Bitcoin. It offers faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is accepted by select crypto poker sites, providing an alternative for players seeking a balance between transaction efficiency and broader adoption.\n\n6. Cardano (ADA)\n\nCardano is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a secure and sustainable infrastructure for the development of decentralized applications. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is accepted by some crypto poker platforms. Cardano\u2019s focus on scalability and sustainability makes it an interesting choice for players seeking a forward-looking blockchain solution.\n\n7. Dogecoin (DOGE)\n\nOriginally created as a lighthearted cryptocurrency, Dogecoin has gained a significant following and community. While not as widely supported in the crypto poker industry as other cryptocurrencies, some platforms accept Dogecoin as a payment option. Dogecoin\u2019s playful nature and active community may appeal to players looking for a fun and unique poker experience.\n\nPlease note that the availability of cryptocurrencies for poker may vary depending on the platform and region. It\u2019s always advisable to check with the specific online poker site for their supported cryptocurrencies before making a deposit.\n\nWhat To Look For From A Crypto Poker Site\n\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a new crypto poker site, it can be hard to know which of your options is best. There are so many great sites to choose from, that it can be a bit daunting! If you\u2019re not sure where to start, take a look at our list below for some of the most important factors to consider when looking for a new crypto poker site.\n\nCrypto Payment Options \u2013 One of the first things you should look for when checking out a prospective crypto poker site is whether or not they support your chosen cryptocurrency. Some poker rooms support dozens of different cryptocurrencies, whereas some only support a handful of them, so always check before signing up.\n\nGame Selection \u2013 Another thing you should look for is what the traffic is like for your favorite game. If you\u2019re an Omaha-maniac, you\u2019ll want to play on a poker site that has plenty of Omaha games running. However, if you\u2019re more of a Hold\u2019em tournament player, you\u2019ll want to take a look at the MTT schedule before signing up.\n\nBonuses and Promotions \u2013 Everyone\u2019s favorite part of signing up for a new poker room is claiming all the bonuses and promotions they have to offer. Some sites offer huge matched deposit bonuses that really boost your bankroll, so make sure you shop around for the best offers.\n\nSecurity Features \u2013 You\u2019ll want to know that when you sign up for a crypto poker room that your data and your crypto will remain secure on the site. Look for features like SSL encryption and firewall technology to ensure that your details are safe."

        "content": "\"How can I make money with Bitcoin in Nigeria in 2023?\" This may be your question and I have answers for you. Bitcoin is a digital currency that has been gaining popularity in recent years. It is also known as a cryptocurrency and operates independently of a central bank or government. In simple terms, it is a form of digital money that can be sent and received electronically, similar to how you would send and receive money through your bank account.\n\nNow, let's talk about Nigeria. As you may already know, Nigeria is a country in West Africa with a population of over 200 million people. In recent years, interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been on the rise in Nigeria. This is because more and more people are becoming aware of the potential benefits that come with using digital currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nThe purpose of this blog article is to explore different ways you can make money with Bitcoin in Nigeria in 2023. Whether you're new to Bitcoin or have been following it for a while, this post will help you understand the different opportunities available to you and how you can take advantage of them.\n\nThe truth is, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can seem intimidating and confusing at first. But, with a little bit of knowledge and the right approach, anyone can start making money with Bitcoin in Nigeria. In this blog post, I'll be breaking down the most popular and effective ways to make money with Bitcoin in Nigeria, so you can decide which one is right for you. From buying and selling Bitcoin to trading and mining, I'll cover it all.\n\nSo, whether you're looking to make a quick buck or want to build a long-term investment portfolio, this post will provide you with the information and resources you need to get started. So, let's dive in and explore the exciting world of Bitcoin and how you can make money with it in Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\n\nSix Bitcoin business opportunities in Nigeria in 2023\n\n1. Buying and Selling Bitcoin\n\nBuying and selling Bitcoin can seem like a daunting task, but it's actually quite simple once you understand the basics. Bitcoin is a digital currency that can be bought and sold on various online platforms.\n\nFirst, you'll need to create an account on a platform that allows you to buy Bitcoin. Some popular options include Binance, Localbitcoins, and Nairaex. Once you've created an account, you'll need to verify your identity and link a payment method. This can be a bank account or a debit/credit card.\n\nOnce your account is set up and verified, you can start buying Bitcoin. The process of buying Bitcoin is similar to buying anything else online. You'll need to select the amount of Bitcoin you want to buy and then complete the purchase using your linked payment method. It's important to note that the price of Bitcoin can fluctuate greatly, so it's a good idea to keep an eye on the current price before making a purchase.\n\nOnce you have Bitcoin, you can then choose to hold onto it or sell it. To sell your Bitcoin, simply use a crypto platform that sells Bitcoin at the highest rates. A good recommendation is Breet App.\n\nBreet App\n\nBreet App is notably the best crypto trading app to sell Bitcoin in Nigeria at the highest crypto rates. You'll then be able to select the amount of Bitcoin you want to sell and complete the transaction. The money will then be credited to your linked Naira bank account in seconds.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that buying and selling Bitcoin carries some level of risk, as the value of Bitcoin can be quite volatile. So, it's important to do your research and understand the risks before making any investment.\n\n2. Trading Bitcoin\n\nTrading Bitcoin can be a great way to make money in Nigeria, but it can also be risky. To trade Bitcoin, you will need to buy it first and then hold onto it in the hopes that its value will go up. If it does, you can sell it for a profit. But if the value goes down, you could lose money.\n\nWhen it comes to trading Bitcoin, the key is to have a strategy and stick to it. You should also pay attention to the news and events that could affect the value of Bitcoin, such as changes in government regulations or major companies announcing they will accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\nOne popular strategy for trading Bitcoin is called \"day trading.\" This involves buying and selling Bitcoin within the same day, trying to make small profits each time. Day traders often use technical analysis to make decisions on when to buy and sell. This is a method of studying charts and patterns to try and predict future price movements.\n\nAnother strategy is called \"swing trading.\" This involves holding onto Bitcoin for a period of a few days to a few weeks, looking to make larger profits. Swing traders also often use technical analysis, but they may also pay attention to broader market trends and news events.\n\nIt's important to note that trading Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency for that matter, is highly speculative, and it can be risky. It is not recommended for individuals who are not well-versed in financial markets and have no experience with trading. It's always a good idea to start small and invest only what you can afford to lose.\n\nBefore you start trading Bitcoin, it's also a good idea to learn as much as you can about the different exchanges and platforms that are available. Each one has its own fees, features, and risks. It's also important to make sure you have a secure way to store your Bitcoin, such as a hardware wallet.\n\n3. Mining Bitcoin\n\nMining Bitcoin is the process of using specialised computer hardware to verify and record transactions on the Bitcoin network. In return for their work, miners are rewarded with newly created Bitcoins. It's important to note that mining Bitcoin is not the same as buying or trading Bitcoin. It's a way to earn Bitcoin by contributing to the network's security and stability.\n\nWhen someone makes a transaction using Bitcoin, that transaction is broadcast to the entire network. Miners then pick up these transactions and group them into blocks. These blocks are then added to the existing chain of blocks, called the blockchain. This process is called \"mining.\"\n\nTo mine Bitcoin, you need specialised hardware called an ASIC miner. These machines are specifically designed for the task of mining Bitcoin and are much more efficient than a regular computer. They can be costly to purchase, so some miners join a mining pool, where they work together with other miners to increase their chances of earning Bitcoin.\n\nThe process of mining Bitcoin is also resource-intensive, and it requires a lot of electricity. This is why many miners are located in areas with cheap electricity, such as China. However, with the advent of renewable energy, some miners are now located in areas with abundant solar or wind power.\n\nWhen a block is mined, the miner who mined it is rewarded with newly created Bitcoins. This reward is called the block reward, and it is currently set at 6.25 Bitcoins per block. The block reward is also halved every 210,000 blocks, which happens roughly every 4 years. This means that the number of new Bitcoins created each day will decrease over time. This is done to keep the total number of Bitcoins in circulation from getting too large.\n\nMining Bitcoin can be a profitable endeavour, but it's not for everyone. It requires a significant investment in hardware and electricity, and the difficulty of mining increases over time as more miners join the network. Additionally, the price of Bitcoin can also be volatile, which means that the value of the Bitcoins you mine can fluctuate greatly.\n\n4. Accepting Bitcoin as Payment\n\nAccepting Bitcoin as a form of payment for goods and services can seem daunting at first, but it's actually quite simple and can offer many benefits for your business.\n\nFirst, let's explain what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is a digital currency, or cryptocurrency, that allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority. It's decentralised and operates on a technology called \u201cBlockchain\u201d.\n\nNow, let's talk about how your business can start accepting Bitcoin as payment in Nigeria. The first step is to set up a reliable Bitcoin wallet that allows you to easily receive Bitcoin and quickly exchange it for cash. Breet App is a reliable Bitcoin wallet to accept BTC as a payment option for your business, which is like a digital bank account for your Bitcoin. There are many different types of wallets available, including software wallets that you can download to your computer or mobile device, and hardware wallets that are like USB drives.\n\nNext, you'll need to display your Bitcoin address, which is like a bank account number, on your website or in your store so customers can send payments to you. With Breet App you do not have to do anything, there are many features to allow businesses to conveniently accept Bitcoin. One of the features is \u201cAutomatic Settlement\u201d which automatically converts every crypto you receive to cash and immediately sends it to your linked bank account.\n\nThere\u2019s also a crypto rate calculator that businesses can use to calculate how much Bitcoin your customer should pay in equivalent to its Naira value.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of accepting Bitcoin as payment is that it can attract new customers who are looking for businesses that accept this form of payment. And because Bitcoin transactions are decentralised, there are no transaction fees, which can save your business money. Additionally, Bitcoin transactions are fast, meaning that customers don't have to wait for the payment to clear like they would with traditional methods.\n\nAnother benefit of Bitcoin is that it's borderless, meaning that you can accept payments from anyone in the world, opening up new possibilities for your business.\n\nIt's important to note that the value of Bitcoin can be quite volatile, so it's a good idea to convert the Bitcoin you receive into your local currency as soon as possible to avoid any potential losses.\n\n5. Buying and Holding Bitcoin\n\nNow, onto buying and holding Bitcoin. The basic idea is to purchase Bitcoin at a lower price and then hold onto it until the price increases, at which point you can sell it for a profit. This is similar to how you might invest in stocks or real estate, but with Bitcoin, you have the added benefit of it being a global currency that is not subject to the same economic and political pressures.\n\nSo, how do you buy Bitcoin in Nigeria? There are several ways to do this, but the most popular is through online exchanges. Once you have your Bitcoin, you will want to store it in a safe and secure wallet. This can be a physical wallet or a digital wallet, but it is important to make sure that it is a reputable and secure option.\n\nNow that you have your Bitcoin, the key is to hold onto it for as long as possible. This means not selling it at the first sign of a price increase, but instead, holding onto it for the long term.\n\nIt's important to note that the price of Bitcoin can be very volatile, so it's important to be patient and not make impulsive decisions based on short-term price fluctuations.\n\n6. Microtasks\n\nMicrotasks are small, simple tasks that can be completed online in exchange for payment. And one of the ways to get paid for these tasks is using bitcoin.\n\nIf you're looking for ways to make money with bitcoin, doing microtasks is a great option. Not only is it easy to do, but you can also get paid quickly and securely.\n\nSome examples of microtasks include:\n\nTaking surveys\n\nTranscribing audio or video\n\nModerating online forums\n\nCategorizing images\n\nTesting websites or apps\n\nTo start making money with bitcoin through microtasks, you'll first need to sign up for a bitcoin wallet. This is where you'll store your bitcoin and receive payments. There are many different wallet options available, such as Coinbase or BlockFi, so be sure to do your research and choose one that works best for you.\n\nOnce you have a wallet set up, you can start looking for microtasks to complete. Websites like Amazon Mechanical Turk and Clickworker are great places to start. These sites connect you with companies and individuals who need help with small tasks, and you can choose from a variety of tasks to complete.\n\nWhen you complete a task, you'll be paid in bitcoin. The amount of bitcoin you earn will vary depending on the task, but it's typically a small amount. However, you can do multiple microtasks to earn more bitcoin.\n\nIt's important to note that microtasks are not a get-rich-quick scheme. You won't make a lot of money doing them, but they can be a great way to earn some extra cash on the side. Plus, since you're getting paid in bitcoin, you have the potential to earn more as the value of bitcoin increases.\n\nConclusion: 6 Ways To Make Money With Bitcoin In Nigeria 2023\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin is a digital currency that has the potential to provide many opportunities for making money in Nigeria in 2023.

        "title": "Bitcoin To Reach $161,800, According To Fibonacci Extension, Elliott Wave Theory | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Bitcoin price is struggling to maintain above $20,000 per coin \u2014 a level that few expected the top cryptocurrency to trade at ever again once it passed the key resistance the first time.\n\nIn a new prediction, the next target for BTCUSD might also reach a level that very few at this point would consider or expect. However, ages-old mathematics and Elliott Wave Theory could suggest the next cycle may possibly peak much sooner than many would believe \u2014 and at price of $161,800 per coin.\n\nFinding Price Targets With The Mysterious Power Of Fibonacci\n\nCryptocurrency traders commonly use Fibonacci retracements and extensions to make decisions about where and when to buy or sell. It isn\u2019t known why prices tend to gravitate toward these levels, but the ratios are found all throughout the natural world.\n\nFor example, Venus orbits the sun in 224.6 days, while Earth at 365.2 days. This creates a ratio of 8/13 \u2014 both Fibonacci numbers \u2014 which is roughly 0.618. This is precisely why the golden ratio is also referred to as the divine proportion. It\u2019s almost magical.\n\nFib ratios are derived from the Fibonacci sequence \u2014 a series of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers. The sequence reads 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.\n\nAlthough the sequence is named after the famous Italian mathematician who popularized it, its use dates back to 200BC Indian mathematics. Simply put, this is about as ancient of math as it gets.\n\nBTC reached the 1.618 Fibonacci extension several times during the cycle | CME-BTC! on TradingView.com\n\nExamining Market Cycles With Elliott Wave Theory\n\nRalph Nelson Elliott developed Elliott Wave Theory in the 1930s, yet the study could be the key to figuring out what\u2019s going on with Bitcoin.\n\nElliott Wave Theory believes that market cycles move in five primary waves, with waves one, three, and five moving with the trend, and waves two and four moving against it as corrective phases.\n\nRelationships with Fibonacci are everywhere in Elliot Wave Theory. Impulse waves up tend to fizzle out at Fib extensions, while corrections terminate at Fibonacci retracement levels and extensions.\n\nA five-wave motive wave completes one cycle in five individual waves with three impulses and two corrections. A complete Elliott Wave sequence consists of 21 movements and there are 21 total corrective patterns. Each of the numbers are Fibonacci numbers.\n\nBitcoin's fifth wave might be about to begin | CME-BTC! on TradingView.com\n\nWhy Bitcoin Could Reach $161,800 Per Coin\n\nWith all that background out of the way, we can focus on Bitcoin price. As a speculative asset, it\u2019s especially susceptible to emotion-driven price movements, making it especially responsive to Fibonacci ratios and Elliott Wave Theory.\n\nUsing the BTC CME Futures chart, it is possible to count out a Bitcoin Elliott Wave motive wave still in progress. If the wave count is accurate, it\u2019s possible to project a possible end to the motive wave and bullish cycle by using a Fibonacci extension target.\n\nBitcoin price could reach the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, which is roughly $161,800 per BTC. Interestingly, if you multiply $100K by the golden ratio, you\u2019ll get $161,800. The top cryptocurrency touched the golden ratio target at the 2021 peak when Fibonacci extensions are drawn from the very open of the BTC CME chart to the 2018 bear market bottom.\n\nThe target is contingent on Bitcoin price having ended its wave four expanded flat correction and started its wave five impulse. While wave fives tend to match wave one in magnitude and strength, they can also mimic wave three \u2014 which tends to be the longest and strongest.\n\nIn Search Of Cyclical Confirmation In Crypto\n\nIn the video above, Tony \u201cThe Bull\u201d walks step-by-step through each wave count in Bitcoin and uses textbook Elliott Wave examples to explain how the price action could develop.\n\nIn the exclusive in-depth analysis, each wave terminates at a key Fibonacci level, dating back to the beginning of the Bitcoin bear market. Using a channeling technique to project the next cycle peak, it is possible that the bold target is reached within the next six months to a year.\n\nFinally, the cyclical nature of BTC is possibly further confirmed using Hurst Cycle Theory, which suggests a near-perfect cyclical rhythm of bottoming since 2015. Each major bottom also took place within a logarithmic buy zone and each cyclical top in its sell zone.\n\nThe Fisher Transform is then used to possibly provide confirmation of the presence of yet another significant turning point in BTCUSD \u2014 and possibly the last bullish impulse before the cycle comes to and end.\n\nAs an Elliott Wave partner, I\u2019m able to share FREE State of the Global Markets report access (normally $263) from Elliott Wave International: https://t.co/FEfEGiej72 This 19-day event includes new reports every 2 days & 50+ forecasts on #Bitcoin, gold, stocks, oil, bonds, etc. pic.twitter.com/ZU9JmbSMFt \u2014 Tony \"The Bull\" Spilotro (@tonyspilotroBTC) January 19, 2023"

        "content": "As the crypto market continues to trade in the green zone, Bitcoin (BTC) is on the verge of breaking historical records, likely to influence the asset\u2019s short-term price movement.\n\nAt the current price, Bitcoin has extended its trajectory to a 14-day winning streak, becoming one of the longest consistent periods of positive price movement in history. In this line, the crypto is just one day from reclaiming its longest gains, last recorded in November 2013 at 15 days.\n\nThe current Bitcoin momentum has also surpassed the 10-day streaks of July 2020 and September 2017, according to data by Documenting Bitcoin on January 17.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s historical longest winning streaks chart. Source: Documenting Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is trading at $21,146 after several days of attempting to hold above the position. Over the last 14 days, the maiden crypto has rallied over 20% after days of consolidating below $17,000.\n\nBitcoin YTD price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe market\u2019s current focus is on whether Bitcoin can maintain the gains, which would help the asset reclaim its highs of 2021. Notably, senior market analyst Jim Wycoff suggested that Bitcoin bulls are now in firm control of the asset after weeks of battling with bears.\n\n\u201cThe BC bulls have the firm overall near-term technical advantage amid a price uptrend in place on the daily bar chart. That suggests still more upside in the near term,\u201d Wycoff said.\n\nElsewhere, crypto trading expert and analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe stated that Bitcoin had seen the sweeping of liquidity above the recent highs.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart.

Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin builds on macroeconomic gains\n\nThe current price of Bitcoin is an outcome of general optimism following the cooling down of the United States inflation rate. The possibility of the Federal Reserve slowing down on interest rate hikes has helped Bitcoin and the general market put the bruising 2022 behind.\n\nThe outlook is also driving optimism in the sector regarding the possible entry of more investors led by institutions. Additionally, at the current gains, Bitcoin appears to have put behind the effects of the FTX crypto exchange collapse.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
