        "title": "New Class Explores Technical And Economic Foundations Of Bitcoin - Texas A&M University Today",
        "content": "A new course offered at Texas A&M University this semester is \u201cThe Bitcoin Protocol\u201d in which students learn about the technical and economic foundation of the much-talked about cryptocurrency.\n\nThe first of its kind at Texas A&M, the class is open to accounting and computer science students and is being taught by Mays Business School Associate Professor of Accounting and Founder of the Mays Innovation Research Center Dr. Korok Ray.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is an interdisciplinary project, and I was pleased to see the Mays Business School and the College of Engineering adopt an interdisciplinary mindset in approving this class,\u201d Ray said.\n\nBenefits To Students\n\nAlthough there are other blockchain classes offered at Texas A&M in computer science and computer engineering, Ray\u2019s course is the first to focus specifically on Bitcoin.\n\nThe class will cover all aspects of Bitcoin, such as the underlying technology, the game theory, the macroeconomics, and the application of cryptography.\n\nRay \u2014 whose research interests are accounting, game theory and technology \u2014 said the class is primarily for undergraduates to provide hands-on experience with Bitcoin. \u201cThe students will learn to code portions of the Bitcoin protocol from scratch, which is in itself a great learning experience,\u201d he said.\n\nLearning about this \u201cemerging economy\u201d will open opportunities for students, Ray said.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin economy is booming, especially in Texas,\u201d he said. \u201cThis class can prepare students for the growing Bitcoin mining industry, much of it in Texas. On top of this, Austin is becoming a hub for Bitcoin developers.\u201d\n\nFrom an academic standpoint as well, much can be gained, Ray said. \u201cFirst, Bitcoin is a novel way of storing and transferring value that has vast implications for finance and economics,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin builds on decades of science and is itself a comprehensive learning tool across multiple disciplines. And Bitcoin is a zero-to-one, radical innovation that emerged outside of the traditional corridors of power and influence, and is therefore a deeply inspiring story of human achievement.\u201d\n\nCrypto Controversies\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have both proponents and doubters, as any sweep of social media or cable news channels will reveal. One thing everyone seems to agree on is the current state of affairs \u2014 a so-called \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d meaning the market is performing poorly. The highly publicized FTX fiasco arguably added flame to the fire.\n\n\u201cThe current crypto winter will prove the difference between a decentralized protocol like Bitcoin and a centralized company like FTX that is subject to fraud and abuse,\u201d Ray predicts. \u201cI am confident that Bitcoin will emerge out of these ashes, but don\u2019t trust me on that \u2014 verify for yourself.\u201d\n\nCross-discipline Collaboration\n\nRay said faculty in both Mays and Engineering are to be credited with the creation of the Bitcoin class, namely Scott Schaefer of the Department of Computer Science and Nate Sharp of the Department of Accounting.\n\n\u201cLeadership like this is vital to exposing students to the frontiers of new innovation, which happens precisely in between existing academic disciplines,\u201d Ray said."

The S&P 500 and Doe Jones Industrial Average were last down 0.9% and 2.9%, respectively, for the week. The Nasdaq Composite, however, has been the outperformer. It's up slightly for the week and has gained 5% for the year, leading the other big indexes.\n\nBitcoin and ether rose 2.73% and 2.15%, respectively, in the same four-day period.\n\n\"Bitcoin seems to be trading along with the Nasdaq and risk assets again, after the past months of decoupling,\" said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs. \"This is good news for crypto investors in that if inflation is falling, and the Fed is closer to the end than the beginning of economic tightening, risk assets will catch a breath of fresh air and perhaps lure investors back in.\""

        "content": "Despite the ongoing Crypto Winter, Bitcoin supporters are certain that the future for the fledgling industry is bright. And so far this year, they\u2019ve had reason to celebrate. Bitcoin\u2019s price has jumped more than 25% in the past few weeks alone after a dismal 2022. But JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon still isn\u2019t a believer. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, Dimon bashed cryptocurrencies as a distraction.\n\n\u201cI think all that\u2019s been a waste of time and why you guys waste any breath on it is totally beyond me,\u201d he told CNBC. \u201cBitcoin itself is a hyped up fraud. It\u2019s a pet rock.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Dimon has expressed his doubts about cryptocurrencies\u2014or used a \u201cpet rock\u201d analogy to describe digital assets. The CEO has described Bitcoin a \u201cfraud\u201d since 2017; and after the blow-up of what was once the world\u2019s second largest crypto exchange FTX late last year, he argued the entire industry was a \u201ccomplete sideshow.\u201d\n\nCNBC anchor Joe Kernen pushed back on Dimon\u2019s claims that Bitcoin is a fraud on Thursday, arguing the cryptocurrency is a \u201cstore of value\u201d that is \u201cimmutable\u201d and \u201cscarce,\u201d noting its protocol indicates that there will only ever be 21 million coins.\n\n\u201cTotally untrue. How do you know it\u2019s gonna stop at 21 million? Maybe it\u2019s going to get to 21 million and Satoshi\u2019s picture is going to come up and laugh at you all,\u201d Dimon quipped, referencing the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto that was used by Bitcoin\u2019s anonymous creator, or creators.\n\nBut while Dimon doesn\u2019t believe in cryptocurrencies, when it comes to the blockchain technology that they\u2019re built on, he has a much more positive outlook.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cBlockchain is a technology ledger system that we use to move information. We\u2019ve used it to do overnight repo, intraday repo, we\u2019ve used it to move money, right? So that\u2019s a technology ledger that we think will be deployable.\u201d\n\nDimon and JPMorgan have leaned into blockchain technology since 2017, when the bank was one of 86 firms that helped create an open-source blockchain initiative called The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. And as Dimon mentioned above, the company uses its own cryptocurrency, the JPM Coin, to carry out intraday repurchase agreements. But on Thursday, Dimon noted that the financial industry has been talking about using blockchain technology for 12 years and, to this point, he said \u201cvery little has been done.\u201d"

Bitcoin, he declared, is a \u201chyped-up fraud\u201d; it\u2019s a \u201cpet rock.\u201d\n\nTell us what you really think, Mr. Dimon.\n\nActually, Dimon seems to share the same view of Bitcoin that I and many other economists have had all along: The digital \u201ccurrency\u201d isn\u2019t really a currency. That is, it can\u2019t be used as a medium of exchange \u2014 there are very few things you can buy directly with Bitcoin \u2014 and it isn\u2019t a stable store of value with reasonably predictable future purchasing power. So it\u2019s basically useless \u2014 as Dimon says, it\u2019s a pet rock.\n\nHowever, one concern that has long nagged at sophisticated crypto skeptics is that most of the negative things one could say about Bitcoin can also be said about gold. You can\u2019t buy groceries, or even a house, with gold ingots. And historically the purchasing power of gold has been highly unstable. Here\u2019s a chart from Macrotrends of the real price of gold \u2014 the price divided by the Consumer Price Index \u2014 since 1970:"

But since the crypto market slide of 2022, there are far fewer crypto firms with flashy store fronts at Davos.\n\nCNBC asked people in the vicinity on Monday whose car it is but nobody saw who parked it. Two crypto executives who spoke to CNBC did not welcome the presence of the car, given the near $1.4 trillion wipeout of the market last year and the excesses of the industry are under scrutiny.\n\nOne exec said that the presence of such a car was not helpful for the industry's reputation which took a hit last year.\n\nThe license plate had \"Kuna\" printed on it, which is the name of a Ukrainian cryptocurrency exchange."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said bitcoin is a fraud, repeating his criticism of the world's largest cryptocurrency amid the market's struggles after the FTX collapse. The banking exec also delivered an ominous warning for the world economy as it nears the one-year mark since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDimon has been a loud skeptic of crypto, blasting the industry as a \"complete sideshow\" after the collapse of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried's failed crypto exchange. That's because crypto tokens are often tied to criminal activity, Dimon said, though his views of the underlying blockchain technology are more favorable.\n\n\"I think all that is a waste of time, and why you guys waste any breath on it is beyond me,\" Dimon said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. \"Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud. It's a pet rock,\" he said.\n\nDimon hit back at claims that tokens like bitcoin have built in scarcity that prevents it from being devalued, with just 21 million of the coins in existence. Those arguments are \"totally untrue,\" Dimon said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"How do you know it's going to stop at 21 million? Everyone says that. Well maybe it's going to get to 21 million and Satoshi's picture is going to come up and laugh at you all,\" he added.\n\nDimon also gave a bearish prediction for the US economy this year, with inflation still well-above the Fed's 2% target and interest rates expected to rise past 5%, which market commentators have warned could spark a recession. He added that one of the biggest problems facing the global economy is the war between Russia and Ukraine, a conflict that's disrupted supply chains and spiked energy prices around the world.\n\n\"The real issue for the world is Russia, war, Ukraine, energy, trade, and that is serious. And that's still out there. Hopefully it will mitigate and go away, but it may not,\" he said. \"The only thing that matters for the future of the world is how this thing plays out.\"\n\nAs for signs of bullishness investors have been showing since the start of the year, Dimon isn't convinced a lasting rally is here. \"Markets have always been wrong,\" Dimon warned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDimon previously forecasted a mild recession to hit the US this year and stocks to drop 20%, though he said his team was preparing for a more severe downturn. He added that the Fed would likely need to continue its aggressive policy to sufficiently rein in inflation, predicting interest rates would push past 6%."

        "title": "Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin up over 21% in best weekly performance since Feb. 2021. Bull run or bull trap? - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 21.7% from Jan. 11 to Jan. 18, trading at US$21,212 at 2 p.m. on Wednesday in Hong Kong. Ether gained 18% in the same timeframe, changing hands at US$1,576.\n\nWith Bitcoin above the US$21,000 mark, the world\u2019s benchmark cryptocurrency has returned to its price level from before the Nov. 11 collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. BTC prices have since slipped, trading at US$20,935 at 4.30 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong.\n\nKasper Vandeloock, the chief executive officer of quantitative trading firm Musca Capital, attributes the recovery to \u201cslower inflation, interest from venture capitalists and the tech sector.\u201d\n\nChris Bradbury, chief executive officer of DeFi capital management protocol Oasis, said inflation may have peaked in developed countries and this is the primary driver for crypto and traditional markets. \u201cThe feeling also seems to be that the expected recession this year won\u2019t be as deep as initially thought,\u201d he said in an email response to questions.\n\nBradbury said Bitcoin and Ether are rallying because of the bullish momentum in traditional markets. \u201cBitcoin, along with most crypto assets, are still heavily correlated and priced like tech stocks, and we have seen most of these also increase in the last few weeks too, but often crypto prices move at an exaggerated rate.\u201d\n\nVandeloock said that the crypto market is seeing some relief after a difficult year: \u201cMany traders got aggressively short after FTX\u2019s insolvency and they are now looking to get out of their position,\u201d wrote Vandeloock, adding that \u201cEther has been able to find a bottom sooner than BTC, because of the Merge and interest from DeFi. BTC is simply catching up to what ETH has already done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe impressive price action seen in Bitcoin is clear evidence that investors are now positively accumulating the coin,\u201d Abraham Piha, chief executive officer of Tomi, an anonymous decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), wrote to Forkast. \u201cWith Bitcoin mining activity increasing, as evidenced by the recent all-time high in hashrate, it is clear that miners ran out of coins to sell, resulting in more coins for investors to buy.\u201d\n\nSolana\u2019s native token was the week\u2019s biggest gainer among the 10 largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, up 39.3% on the weekly chart, trading at US$22.\n\nThe global crypto market cap exceeded US$1 trillion on Jan. 15, for the first time since Nov. 8, according to CoinGecko data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$409 billion market cap currently accounts for 39.86% while Ether makes up 18.5% of the total market cap.\n\nMetaverse tokens gain momentum\n\nDecentraland\u2019s MANA rose 71.1% this past week to trade at US$0.69. This represented the biggest weekly gains in the entire crypto market, according to CoinGecko data. The Sandbox\u2019s native token, SAND, also rallied 42.3%, to change hands at US$0.74.\n\n\u201cThe metaverse is the new buzzword in the broader digital and tech ecosystem, and related tokens are benefiting from it. Many investors believe that metaverse protocols will be a major entry point into Web3 for billions of people, so the underlying tokens\u2019 appeal has grown even stronger this year,\u201d wrote Piha.\n\nVandeloock attributes this surge to the low liquidity of metaverse coins: \u201cPeople were looking to play altcoins since many were double-digit green over the last few weeks. These metaverse coins are illiquid and have low volume making them the perfect market to play at these times.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe liquidity of metaverse tokens is incredibly low, and as always when there are fairly large market movements, you will see lower liquidity tokens have larger than average swings, however, it often isn\u2019t sustainable,\u201d wrote Bradbury.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Uniswap, SAND only has US$1.5 million of value locked, MANA even less at US$640,000 \u2013 so again, short-term views to try and find conclusions like this are very difficult. The real test will be if things like SAND and MANA can sustain the excess gains they achieved over the next 30-60 days against BTC and ETH,\u201d added Bradbury.\n\n\u201cAs Bloomberg\u2019s market strategist, Mike McGlone, correctly pointed out, the current massive Federal Reserve tightening is a significant selling point that has been driving the price of BTC and the market as a whole. With their positive fundamentals, many altcoins are also contributing to the underlying market push,\u201d wrote Piha.\n\nWhat\u2019s in store for next week?\n\n\u201cLast week, the crypto market cap crossed US$1 trillion several times. We can expect the industry valuation to form support at US$1 trillion while pushing for new highs. However, investors should be wary of monetary tightening in the near term due to interest rate hikes around the world,\u201d wrote Piha.\n\n\u201cThe biggest effects on the price of the markets last year came from highly unexpected events, such as 3AC, FTX and so on. It\u2019s likely the recent gains that appeared over the last two weeks will pull back slightly though, this is often what we see during uncertain times \u2013 the main question will be if the markets can at least hold onto some of the gains made,\u201d wrote Bradbury, adding that \u201cthere is still a lot of uncertainty in traditional markets,\u201d and that the industry \u201chas a lot of trust to get back from all of its issues last year involving centralized parties such as 3AC, FTX and Genesis.\u201d\n\nDespite last year\u2019s events rocking the trust in centralized crypto companies and the wider crypto industry, Bitcoin\u2019s 23% rally in the week through Jan. 15 represents its best weekly performance since Feb. 2021. According to Bloomberg analysts, this usually signals the start of a bigger rally: \u201cWeekly climbs of at least 20% occurred nine times in the past five years, after which the token added an average of 40% over three months.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin faces $15K crash as US sparks 'financial meltdown' \u2014 Arthur Hayes - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In his latest blog post released on Jan. 19, Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of the BitMEX exchange, predicted a \u201cglobal financial meltdown\u201d thanks to future United States economic woes.\n\nHayes: Crypto will \u201cget smoked\u201d in Fed pivot\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current rally should likely not be taken as the start of a new bull run, Hayes says in the fresh treatise on U.S. macroeconomic policy, warning that crypto assets will \u201cget smoked\u201d when Federal Reserve policy flips from restrictive to liberal.\n\nWith U.S. inflation easing, the Fed is the focus of practically every crypto analyst this year as they estimate the likelihood of a policy \u201cpivot\u201d away from quantitative tightening (QT) and interest rate hikes to flat and then decreasing rates, and potentially even quantitative easing (QE).\n\nThis essentially involves a move away from draining the economy of liquidity to injecting it back in, and while that practice led to new all-time highs for Bitcoin beginning in 2020, the same phenomenon would not be plain sailing next time around, Hayes believes.\n\n\u201cIf a removal of half a trillion dollars in 2022 created the worst bond and stock performance in a few hundred years, imagine what will happen if double that amount is removed in 2023,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThe reaction of the markets when money is injected vs. withdrawn is not symmetrical \u2014 and as such, I expect that the law of unintended consequences will bite the Fed in the ass as it continues to withdraw liquidity.\u201d\n\nAs such, rather than a smooth transition away from QT, Hayes is betting on extreme circumstances forcing the Fed to act.\n\n\u201cSome part of the US credit market breaks, which leads to a financial meltdown across a broad swath of financial assets,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cIn a response similar to the action it took in March 2020, the Fed calls an emergency press conference and stops QT, cuts rates significantly and recommences Quantitative Easing (QE) by purchasing bonds once more.\u201d\n\nThis in turn means \u201crisky asset prices crater.\u201d\n\n\u201cBonds, equities, and every crypto under the sun all get smoked as the glue that holds together the global USD-based financial system dissolves,\u201d the blog post continues.\n\nCurrent estimates, as shown by CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, overwhelmingly favor the Fed lowering the pace of rate hikes at its next decision on Feb. 1.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart. Source: CME Group\n\nPlanning a March 2020 rerun\n\nHayes is far from alone in being suspicious of Bitcoin (BTC) being a firm \u201cbuy\u201d at present after two weeks of near-vertical price growth.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin sees new 4-month high as US PPI, retail data post \u2018big misses\u2019\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, various commentators wager that new macro lows will still appear, with BTC/USD taking out its floor from the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nThose taking a leap of faith and piling in now thus face serious risk before reward.\n\n\u201cThis scenario is less ideal because it would mean that everyone who is buying risky assets now would be in store for massive drawdowns in performance. 2023 could be just as bad as 2022 until the Fed pivots,\u201d Hayes wrote, nonetheless calling that scenario his \u201cbase case.\u201d\n\nIf that means a retest of the 2022 lows, the area between $15,000 and $16,000 will be a key zone of interest going forward.\n\n\u201cI will know that the market has probably bottomed, because the crash that happens when the system temporarily breaks will either hold the previous $15,800 lows, or it won\u2019t,\u201d the blog post concludes.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter what level is ultimately reached on the down draft because I know the Fed will subsequently move to print money and avert another financial collapse, which will in turn mark the local bottom of all risky assets. And then I get another setup similar to March 2020, which requires me to back up the truck and purchase crypto with two hands and a shovel.\u201d\n\nBitcoin faces a drop to $15,000 \u201cor lower\u201d as part of the mass risk asset capitulation, Hayes says.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour candle chart (Bitstamp).

        "title": "Bitcoin price corrected, but bulls are positioned to profit in Friday's $580M BTC options expiry - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price has held above $20,700 for 4 days, fueling bulls\u2019 hope for another leg up to $23,000 or even $25,000. Behind the optimistic move was a decline in inflationary pressure, confirmed by the December 2022 wholesale prices for goods on Jan. 18.\n\nThe United States producer price index, which measures final demand prices across hundreds of categories also declined 0.5% versus the previous month.\n\nEurozone inflation also came in at 9.2% year-on-year in December, marking the second consecutive decline from October's 10.7% record high. A milder-than-expected winter reduced the risk of a gas shortages and softened energy prices, boosting analysts\u2019 hope of a \"soft landing.\" According to analysts, a soft landing would avoid a deep recession and possibly convince central banks to curb their interest rate hikes.\n\nThis week\u2019s $580 million BTC options expiry on Jan. 20 looks like an easy win for bulls because the surprise seven-day, 23% rally above $21,000 caused most bearish bets to become worthless. The recent move has holders (or hodlers) calling a market bottom and the potential end to the bear market, but the options market might hold the answer.\n\nCan Bitcoin options help bulls secure the $20,000 floor?\n\nIt might seem like a distant reality right now, but Bitcoin was trading below $17,500 just seven days ago. As the weekly options expiry on Jan. 20 approaches, the bullish bets are about to pay off, while bears will see their options becoming worthless as the deadline looms over them.\n\nBears\u2019 main hope is the possibility of the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates by 50 basis points at the next meeting, but that won\u2019t take place until Feb. 1. The latest data on U.S. retail sales have shown a 1.1% retreat in December, the second consecutive spending cut. The odds are increasingly favorable for a 25 basis point interest rate increase, signaling that the central bank's effort to curb inflation is achieving its expected results.\n\nIf bulls win on Jan. 20, they will likely add buying pressure and fuel the $20,000 support level.\n\nBitcoin bears were caught entirely off-guard\n\nThe open interest for the Jan. 20 options expiry is $580 million, but the actual figure will be lower since bears were decimated after Bitcoin breached $20,000. Bulls are in complete control, even though their payout becomes larger at $21,000 and higher.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for Jan. 20. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe 1.18 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $150 million call (buy) open interest and the $125 million put (sell) options. If Bitcoin\u2019s price remains above $17,000 at 8:00 am UTC on Jan. 13, less than $2 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to sell Bitcoin at $16,500 or $15,500 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\n$21,000 Bitcoin would give bulls a $220 million profit\n\nBelow are the three most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Jan. 20 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $19,000 and $20,000: 7,500 calls vs. 1,700 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $110 million.\n\n7,500 calls vs. 1,700 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $110 million. Between $20,000 and $21,000: 800 calls vs. 8,100 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $165 million.\n\n800 calls vs. 8,100 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $165 million. Between $21,000 and $22,000: 10,600 calls vs. 200 puts. The net result favors bulls by $220 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor example, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price, but unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin sees new 4-month high as US PPI, retail data post 'big misses'\n\nBitcoin bears need to push the price below $20,000 on Friday to minimize the loss. On the other hand, the bulls can double their gains by pumping the price above $21,000 on Jan. 20 and profiting by $220 million.\n\nThe 7-day rally toward $21,300 liquidated $1.2 billion worth of leverage short (sell) futures contracts, so they might have less margin required to subdue Bitcoin's price.\n\nFor now, bulls are well positioned to profit from the BTC weekly options expiry and use the proceeds to defend the $20,000 support.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price saw a lot of flash rallies last year that only led to more downward price pressure. The new rally to start the new year, however, could actually have legs, as it responds positively to macroeconomic data.\n\nUp over 25% to start the new year, bitcoin\u2019s recent price rally is following strength in traditional financial assets like stocks and bonds. This continues last year\u2019s trend when bitcoin mirrored stocks and bonds on the way down amid rising inflation, but while the trend has reversed, bitcoin has followed.\n\n2022 ended with inflation showing a modest retreat, giving risk assets a boost as the expectation is that the U.S. Federal Reserve will start scaling back on interest rate hikes. That, in effect, is bringing the dollar down and potentially bringing more capital to riskier assets like bitcoin.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing the dollar put in a top, inflation easing, interest rate hikes slowing down \u2013 all pointing to markets getting more risk-on over the next few months,\u201d said Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, in a CNBC report.\n\nThe ICE US Dollar Index and bitcoin\u2019s latest price movements show restored confidence in risk assets again. The index is down 2% while bitcoin has risen close to 20% within the past month, highlighting the early strength in the new year.\n\nInvestors Leaving FTX Collapse in the Past\n\nLast year\u2019s collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX certainly dashed any hopes of a holiday rally as 2022 was winding down. The collapse shook investors\u2019 confidence and kept prospective market entrants at bay who were looking at potentially investing in bitcoin at the current low price.\n\nNonetheless, the early 2023 rally could be a sign that investors are ready to put the FTX collapse behind them. With dissipating inflation and less interest rate hikes, that could continue to fuel a risk-on rally that could feed into higher bitcoin prices.\n\n\u201cBitcoin looks to have recoupled with macro data as investors shrug off the FTX collapse,\u201d James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset management firm CoinShares, told CNBC.\n\n\u201cThe most important macro data investors are focussing on is the weak services PMI and the trending down of employment and wage data,\u201d Butterfill added. \u201cThis coupled with downwards trend in inflation has led to improving confidence, while it comes at a time when valuations for Bitcoin \u2026 are close to all time lows. The prospect of looser monetary policy off the back of weaker macro data and low valuations is what has led this rally.\u201d\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "Billionaire Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund made a timely crypto trade last year.\n\nThe venture capital firm sold most of its cryptocurrency holdings before last year\u2019s market crash, pulling in $1.8 billion from the trade, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.\n\nThe fund, known to invest in groundbreaking technologies, built a position in crypto over time. It made its first bitcoin investment in 2014, and a majority of its crypto holdings were made up of the original cryptocurrency, partners of the fund told TechCrunch in March last year.\n\nFounders Fund, which has $11 billion in assets under management, sold a big chunk of its crypto at the end of March 2022, a source told the FT. Bitcoin traded around $41,976 at the time, down around 40% from its all-time high.\n\nThat well-timed trade was made before the crash of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) in May, which marked the start of the crypto market carnage.\n\nA representative for Founders Fund didn\u2019t return Blockworks\u2019 request for comment by press time.\n\nNotably, Thiel made a pro-bitcoin speech just a month after his fund reportedly sold most of its crypto. He said the rise in bitcoin\u2019s price was an implication that the \u201ccentral banks are bankrupt\u201d and that it signaled \u201cthe end of the fiat money regime.\u201d He also spoke out against bitcoin\u2019s critics, calling billionaire investor Warren Buffett \u201cEnemy No.1\u201d and a \u201csociopathic grandpa from Omaha.\u201d\n\nWhen bitcoin was hovering near $60,000 in 2021, Thiel reportedly said that it was a sign the US political system was not stable. \u201cI don\u2019t know that you should put all your money into bitcoin at $60,000 a bitcoin right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut surely the fact that it is at $60,000 is an extremely hopeful sign.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Thiel said at an event in Miami, in October 2021, that he felt he was \u201cunderinvested\u201d in bitcoin. He also suggested he had some hesitation in investing in it because he thought \u201cthe secret was already known by everybody,\u201d then added that \u201cI think the answers are still to go long\u201d on bitcoin.\n\nCrypto wasn\u2019t the only investment Founders Fund offloaded. Between 2020 and 2022, the fund had eight other big exits including Airbnb and Palantir, a move that allowed it to return about $13 billion to investors, the FT reported.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin held steady near its most recent $21,000 perch, and a leading crypto analyst said the market had already priced in the looming bankruptcy filing of crypto brokerage Genesis Global Capital and other recent industry debacles stemming from the collapse of disgraced crypto exchange FTX .\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,980, up 0.8% over the past 24 hours, even as investors mulled conflicting economic reports.\n\n\u201cMost of the negative news should be priced in\u201d because Genesis has been in trouble since the end of last year, Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign-exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Thursday note.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Genesis, a CoinDesk sister company, was in confidential negotiations with various creditor groups, with Genesis warning it could seek bankruptcy protection if it fails to raise capital. Bitcoin\u2019s price tumbled as low as $20,370, a roughly 5% drop from the previous day, after the U.S. Department of Justice foreshadowed an announcement that it was charging Hong Kong-based crypto exchange Bitzlato with laundering $700 million.\n\nBut the announcement turned out to be \u201canticlimactic, at least in contrast to what the markets were guessing would happen,\u201d said Michael Safai, managing partner of crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital. Safai told CoinDesk that the crypto market's recent positive sentiment could lift further if institutional traders maintain BTC\u2019s trading range between $20,000 and $21,000 over the next couple of days.\n\nEther (ETH) was recently changing hands at around $1,550, up 1.1% from Wednesday, same time. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) recently climbed 1.8%.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional markets continued to stumble this week, with the S&P down 0.7% for the day. The S&P, which has a hefty technology component, is off 2.1% for the past five days, as investors remain fretful about the prospect of recession and big banks kicked off the earnings season with mixed results.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrypto-exposed stocks were also varied: Exchange Coinbase (COIN) was down 1.5% for the day, while bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) was up 6.2%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s strong 2023\n\nThe dip of the past two days has hardly dented bitcoin\u2019s sterling performance so far this year. BTC has gained 26% since Jan. 1, rising from weeks-long doldrums around $17,000.\n\nMartin Leinweber, digital assets product specialist at MarketVector Indexes, attributed bitcoin's recent rally to the weakening U.S. dollar, slower inflation and a short squeeze.\n\nAccording to Coinglass data, traders liquidated some $492 million of short positions on Jan. 13, sending BTC above $20,000.\n\nHowever, Leinweber said that it's still hard to call a market bottom because \"normally in a bear market violent rallies tend to fool investors into believing that this is a sustainable one,\" considering liquidity isn't fully returned yet.\n\n\u201cYou very rarely see these V-shaped bottoms,\u201d he told CoinDesk. \u201cYou see a rounding U-form, which just takes a little bit of time and there's a little bit of volatile in between. That's the best-case scenario. But I think you still need the right macro backdrop for risk assets in general to rise and the crypto can outperform.\u201d"

        "content": "Murphy, North Carolina CNN \u2014\n\nWhen Judy Stines first heard about cryptocurrency, \u201cI always thought it was smoke and mirrors,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if that\u2019s what you want to invest in, you do you.\u201d\n\nBut then she heard the sound of crypto, a noise that neighbor Mike Lugiewicz describes as \u201ca small jet that never leaves\u201d and her ambivalence turned into activism. The racket was coming from stacks and stacks of computer servers and cooling fans, mysteriously set up in a few acres of open farm field down on Harshaw Road.\n\nOnce they fired up and the noise started bouncing around their Blue Ridge Mountain homes, sound meters in the Lugiewicz yard showed readings from 55-85 decibels depending on the weather, but more disturbing than the volume is the fact that the noise never stopped.\n\nMike Lugiewicz describes the noise generated by the nearby crypto mine as \"a small jet that never leaves.\" Julian Quinones/CNN\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a racetrack three miles out right here,\u201d Lugiewicz said, pointing away from the crypto mine next door. \u201cYou can hear the cars running. It\u2019s cool!\u201d \u201cBut at least they stop,\u201d Stines chimed in, \u201cAnd you can go to bed!\u201d\n\nCrypto mining noise This is the sound in front of Mike Lugiewicz\u2019s garage. Source: CNN\n\nThe word \u201cmine\u201d evokes pickaxes and coal dust in this region, so at first, the neighbors around Murphy, North Carolina, had no idea that mining a so-called \u201cproof of work\u201d crypto coin is more like playing a computer game with billion-sided dice. Instead of shovels, modern miners need enormous amounts of server power to roll the winning number faster than their competitors around the world.\n\nThis unrelenting demand for electricity was one reason China banned cryptocurrency, touching off a virtual gold rush from Appalachia to New York\u2019s Finger Lakes. Crypto miners began putting down stakes in places where power is cheap and affordable, and if land use or noise regulations even exist, enforcement is weak. The mine in Murphy is just one of a dozen in Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina owned by a San Francisco-based company called PrimeBlock, which recently announced $300 million in equity financing and plans to scale up and go public.\n\nBut a year and a half after crypto came to this ruby red pocket of Republican retirees and Libertarian life-timers, anger over the mine helped flip the balance of local power and forced the Board of Commissioners to officially ask their state and federal officials to \u201cintroduce and champion legislation through the US Congress that would ban and/or regulate crypto mining operations in the United States of America.\u201d\n\n\u201cI personally think that if we can get a bill into the system, other (North Carolina) counties will join,\u201d newly elected Chairman Cal Stiles said after the motion was read. When it passed 5-0, the crowd cheered.\n\n\u201cOh boy, they wanted us so bad a year ago,\u201d PrimeBlock co-owner Chandler Song replied via LinkedIn DM when asked about the move to outlaw his crypto mine. \u201cIt is unconstitutional, to say the least.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Song and his co-founder Ryan Fang made the Forbes \u201cBig Money\u201d 30 under 30 list which features young entrepreneurs with over $10 million in funding. According to the profile, they founded their first blockchain company, ANKR Network, in 2017 when they were in their early 20s.\n\nANKR was eventually folded into the umbrella company PrimeBlock and in the final quarter of 2021, they claimed \u201c$24.4 million of revenue, and over 110 megawatts of installed data center capacity.\u201d This came as Song and Fang teamed up with former Goldman Sachs investment banker Gaurav Budhrani to create a company with an \u201cestimated enterprise value of $1.25 billion\u201d with the hopes of selling public stock on the Nasdaq.\n\nA crypto mine sits in a field along a rural road in Murphy, North Carolina. Mike Belleme/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nA few weeks after that announcement, residents packed the Cherokee County Board meeting where representatives from the company were scheduled to appear, but soon learned that management had changed their minds after a power outage at another crypto site nearby.\n\n\u201cWhen (the outage) was investigated, it was found out that the power outage occurred because someone shot, with a gun, one of the (service lines),\u201d County Commission Chair Dan Eichenbaum told the room to groans. \u201cAs a result of that, the crypto mining people decided they weren\u2019t going to come.\u201d \u201cThey could have joined over video!\u201d one resident said to the board in frustration after the clerk read the company\u2019s statement explaining they canceled \u201cfor employee safety.\u201d\n\nMonths later, Song told The Washington Post that he had received no noise complaints from Cherokee County and said he would build noise insulation walls and install quieter water-based cooling systems. But after erecting walls on only two sides of the mine, construction stopped and the dashed hopes of the community only poured more fuel on local anger as they headed to the polls.\n\nAn aerial view of Murphy, North Carolina. Julian Quinones/CNN\n\n\u201cI\u2019m old. I\u2019m a senior citizen. Social media is not really in my bailiwick,\u201d Stines said as she explained how noise pollution transformed her into an activist. \u201cI like to be behind the scenes and I like to stir the pot. But I knew that we needed to win an election.\u201d\n\nChandler Song went silent when presented with follow-up questions on LinkedIn, but the mine on Hershaw Road roars on as the Cherokee County attorney searches for ways to put legal teeth into a newly passed law against continuous noise without rankling liberty-loving landowners.\n\n\u201cThe Tennessee Valley Authority does not pursue cryptocurrency mines and it is not one of our target markets,\u201d Scott Fiedler, a spokesman for the TVA told CNN. But he acknowledged that the federally owned utility that serves millions in seven states does not keep track of the mines using TVA power, and it\u2019s up to local utilities like the Murphy Electric Power Board to decide who gets service and who gets cut in a blackout.\n\nRon Wright said when his power was cut this winter, the crypto mine stayed online. Julian Quinones/CNN\n\nThat last contingency brought even more bad blood and lost trust during the brutal winter storm that gripped much of the South and forced some of the first rolling blackouts in TVA history. While residents were plunged into cold darkness, they say the power-hungry mine kept humming.\n\n\u201cThey shut us down on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day every hour for anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes to an hour,\u201d resident Ron Wright told CNN. \u201cWell, once your power goes down, your heat pumps go off and pipes freeze. But less than one mile away is crypto, allowed to run on the low end. As soon as the power came back, boom! They\u2019re cranking before we are.\u201d Requests for comment from the Murphy Electric Power Board were not returned.\n\nBack on Harshaw Road, Mike Lugiewicz pointed to the For Sale sign in front of his house. \u201cSeptember of 2021, I think, is when they turned this on and my wife and I just shook our heads, said, \u2018No, we\u2019re out of here.\u2019\u201d He hopes to stay in the area and keep fighting alongside neighbors like Judy Stines until the quiet comes back.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really care what folks invest in,\u201d Stines said with a sigh. \u201cI do care about this noise that affects us every day, all day, all night. It\u2019s never-ending.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct a quote from Judy Stines."

During the 2021 bull run, some mining operations raised funds against their Bitcoin ASICs and BTC reserves.\n\nMiners also preordered ASICs at a hefty premium and some raised funds by conducting IPOs.\n\nAs the crypto market turned bearish and liquidity seized within the sector, miners found themselves in a bad situation and those who were unable to meet their debt obligations were forced to sell the BTC reserves near the market bottom or declare bankruptcy\n\nNotable Bitcoin mining bankruptcies in 2022 came from Core Scientific, filing for bankruptcy, but BTC\u2019s early 2023 performance is beginning to suggest that the largest portion of capitulation has passed.\n\nDespite the strength of the current bear market, a few miners were able to increase production throughout 2022 and on-chain data shows Bitcoin miner accumulation began to increase in December 2022 and momentum appears to be continuing into 2023.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rally to $22,000 improves miner margins\n\nThe 2023 Bitcoin rally which saw BTC price hit a yearly high of $22,153 on Jan. 20, a 17% 7-day increase, has significantly helped BTC mining operations.\n\nAn increase in Bitcoin price and the network\u2019s hashprice are helping BTC miners that kept net positive balances at the end of 2022 which is improving business stability. In addition, now Bitcoin miners are mostly back in profit.\n\nPublic miners Bitcoin sold vs mined. Source: Hashrate Index\n\nWhile more miners are turning back on Bitcoin mining rigs, the difficulty is increasing which may hinder future upside. With conditions improving will Bitcoin miners continue to accumulate or continue the trend of selling?\n\nRecapping 2022, Jaran Mellerud a Bitcoin mining analyst for Luxor Mining said:\n\n\u201cBetween January and November, the public miners offloaded 51,180 bitcoin, while producing 47,284 bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBTC hashprice, a metric that measures the market value of mining or computing power, provides insight into Bitcoin mining operations\u2019 profitability.\n\nSince Jan. 1, 2023, hashprice is up by over 20% and on Jan. 19. Bitcoin mining\u2019s profitability grew from $0.06 per Terra Hash per day (TH/d) to $0.07874 TH/d and this has benefited from BTC\u2019s price rally. Hashprice has not witnessed the recent levels since early October 2022.\n\nBitcoin hashprice. Source: Hashrate Index\n\nAlthough Bitcoin mining profitability has improved since the start of 2023, the industry is still facing rough waters ahead. According to Nico Smid, co-founder of Digital Mining Solutions:\n\n\u201cThe recent increase in hashprice is positive, but many miners are still operating on thin margins. A year ago, the hashprice was at $0.22/TH/day. While the market has reached its lowest point, the current economic conditions for mining remain challenging.\u201d\n\nBitcoin miners are still selling the bulk of their mined BTC\n\nBitcoin miners are benefiting from the uptick in price and data shows many are continuing to sell their rewards.\n\nBitcoin miner positions and revenue. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nThe most robust mining operations actually limited debt and expansion or used a strategy of selling minded BTC while in profit. Using self-reported data, Anthony Power, Bitcoin mining analyst for Compass Mining, compiled a list of miners reserves at the start of the year versus the end of the year.\n\nA year that started with so much promise and optimism and ended with several high profile bankruptcies, with more likely more to follow.\n\n\n\nHere's part 1 of #BTC Mining's year in review for @compass_mining which looks at some of the biggest stories in 2022https://t.co/cbFm8gFmR4 pic.twitter.com/Uyz6iitZRU \u2014 Anthony P\u2b55\ufe0fwer (@cazenove_uk) December 23, 2022\n\nMarathon Digital, the top holder out of the listed Bitcoin mining companies, held 8,133 BTC at the end of December 2022. The company is planning to increase production based on hashprice profitability to further their advantage.\n\nMining difficulty could hinder profits in the future\n\nWith more Bitcoin miners turning their BTC rigs back on, the mining difficulty metric adjusted upward by 10.26% on Jan. 16. Bitcoin difficulty indicates the time and cost to mine BTC in order to receive rewards. The adjustment was the largest since October 2022 and the increase in difficulty makes it more expensive for Bitcoin miners to earn rewards through the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism.\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty. Source: Hashrate Index\n\nWith the upcoming Bitcoin halving event due in 2024, mining BTC will become even more difficult and possibly more expensive for miners, providing more stress on already thin margins. On the upside, the last halving event in 2019 was followed by a 300% gain for BTC the year before.\n\nWhile miners are currently seeing some relief after a tough year, potentially rough roads lie ahead. The business operations are seemingly improving with Bitcoin miners selling for profits rather than taking on debt against Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nJP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon remains a skeptic of almost everything Bitcoin\u2014including the idea that its total supply is limited to 21 million coins.\n\n\u201cHow do you know it's gonna stop at 21 million?\u201d he asked while discussing crypto with CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box on Thursday. \u201cMaybe it's gonna get to 21 million and Satoshi\u2019s picture is gonna come up and laugh at you all.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time he has questioned Bitcoin\u2019s holy number\u2014a defining feature frequently highlighted by the asset\u2019s biggest boosters. Theoretically, an absolute supply cap would give Bitcoin greater scarcity than any government-issued currency on earth, empowering it as a store of value.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou all read the algorithms? You guys all believe that? I don't know, I've always been a skeptic of stuff like that,\u201d he said at an Institute for International Finance event last October.\n\nMany have, in fact, read Bitcoin\u2019s algorithms\u2014which are open source and freely viewable by the entire world. As pointed out by Jameson Lopp, co-founder of the Bitcoin wallet company Casa, Bitcoin\u2019s supply cap is implicitly enforced by just 5 lines of code.\n\nTo be precise, Bitcoin is programmed to cut its supply issuance rate in half every 210,000 blocks, which is roughly every four years. Whereas 50 new BTC were issued per block in 2009, only 6.25 BTC come attached to each block today.\n\nThese events, called \u201chalvings,\u201d are programmed to occur just 33 times, after which Bitcoin\u2019s block reward will be cut to zero. This should occur by the year 2141, assuming nothing changes before that time, Bitcoin developer Luke DashJr told Decrypt.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter 10 halvings, rounding errors begin to truncate,\u201d he specified, referring to the problem of block rewards being unable to divide past Satoshis by the year 2049. \u201cSo if more precision is hardforked in, ideally it should be by 2049.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe math behind these halvings works out such that Bitcoin\u2019s supply cannot touch or surpass 21 million.\n\nThat said, anything enforced by code can technically be changed, as long as users consent to it. Many argue that the Bitcoin community will be forced to upgrade its software to produce more than 21 million coins, in order to provide consistent funds to support the mining industry.\n\n2/ Bitcoin has never generated meaningful transaction revenue relative to its security budget, heavily subsidizing security with block rewards. The current model is unsustainable, weakening its likelihood of becoming the global reserve currency. \u2014 Dan Smith (@smyyguy) January 10, 2023\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s supply is limited, it is still infinitely divisible. Tiny units of the currency could still be used for small transactions, even if its price were to enter the seven-figure range."

        "content": "The humble university dorm is a place for students taking their undergraduate degrees to study, rest, make new friends, host wild dorm parties and, of course, mine Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nA master\u2019s student in market research and self-described \u201cdata guy,\u201d Blake Kaufman, has hooked up an S9 Bitcoin miner to the Bitcoin network.\n\nHe won the S9 miner in a raffle at a mid-Michigan Bitcoin meetup and immediately set about learning how to use it.\n\nBlake has consistently shown up to every https://t.co/2Q6OuIwW4O event with at least one friend, a tremendous attitude, and unmatched enthusiasm.\n\n\n\nGlad you won the S9 raffle!\n\n\n\nHash away at those KYC free sats, and enjoy the heat this winter! https://t.co/AQNzDjnDGC \u2014 Mid-Michigan Bitcoin (@517Bitcoin) November 17, 2022\n\nDuring a video call with Cointelegraph, Blake joked that he knew next to nothing about mining prior to the raffle. The moment he won, he raced to the nearest place offering a power cable and an ethernet connection to try it out, his dad\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cWe turned it on, never hearing one [an S9] before. And if you know, when they start, they immediately rev up to 100% and we\u2019re all just in the room like \u2014 oh my gosh \u2014 this thing is loud! We ran it for probably two hours and we walked into that office and it was hot.\u201d\n\nThe hot and noisy realization kicked his brain into gear. The Michigan winter was fast approaching and his university provides free electricity. Why not mine Bitcoin from a dorm and take advantage of the waste heat? There was one minor but audible hurdle to overcome. \u201cHow can we fix the noise,\u201d he questioned.\n\n\u201cI just looked up online, like, how to noise cancel S9, and this picture of a cooler on Pinterest popped up. Me and my Dad were like, \u2018Let's build it. Why not?\u2019 So we bought a $5 cooler on Facebook Marketplace and we had the tubes in our attic and we spent about two hours drilling holes and it ended up working.\u201d\n\nThe pair constructed the Bitcoin mining cooler box, which now takes up residence in Blake\u2019s dorm. The finished product would not look out of place in any dorm room and is \u201cactually quieter than an air conditioning unit,\u201d he explains.\n\nTwo angles of the cooler-encased Bitcoin miner.\n\nBut aren\u2019t there rules against this sort of thing at university? Won\u2019t the energy-hungry Bitcoin miner put a dent in the university\u2019s electricity overhead?\n\n\u201cSo the miner is about 900 watts an hour, a mini fridge is about 60 to 100 watts a day. So it\u2019s pulling a decent amount of electricity there. I looked up all the rules and it didn\u2019t say anywhere you couldn\u2019t mine a Bitcoin or use a Bitcoin miner. So if they say you can\u2019t do this, I\u2019d be like, okay, you didn\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIn a nutshell, Blake\u2019s not breaking any rules. What\u2019s more, one miner in one dorm in a large university home to thousands of students is unlikely to raise suspicion. It\u2019s an ode to the famous saying attributed to Rear Admiral Grace Hopper that sometimes, \u201cIt is better to ask for forgiveness than permission.\u201d\n\nThe ASIC S9 now whirrs away, generating roughly 0.000001 BTC or 100 satoshis \u2014 the smallest amount of a Bitcoin \u2014 per Bitcoin block, which occurs on average every 10 minutes. It translates to \u201cabout a dollar a day\u201d in fiat-money terms. It\u2019s a paltry amount but not to be sniffed at as a student.\n\nBlake\u2019s total outlay to start his Bitcoin mining venture was a coolbox and a few cables at less than $20 and he can probably reuse the cooler come summertime.\n\nThe mining cooler interior.\n\nIncidentally, Blake\u2019s next challenge is to work out what to do when the weather improves and the mercury rises. Peak summer days in Michigan can hit 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 Celsius). As a result, the outside air temperature will not cool the miner, a vital part of its operation:\n\n\u201cSo I'll have to figure out something, maybe put it in a box of ice cubes and then something like that. I don't know yet.\u201d\n\nBlake has already considered using the Bitcoin miner to heat his family home after graduation. The idea, Blake explains, is to experiment with whether he can offset the gas cost at home and make it profitable. \u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate because, in Michigan, our electricity cost is $0.14 a kilowatt hour.\u201d\n\nMichigan\u2019s energy costs are relatively high in the United States, as shown by a darker purple color. Source: Chooseenergy.com\n\nElectricity and heating costs are higher in Michigan than in energy-producing states like Texas. Using the waste heat from Bitcoin mining could be a way of offsetting the energy costs.\n\nRelated: The Bitcoin shitcoin machine: Mining BTC with biogas\n\nIndeed, tapping into Bitcoin miner waste heat is a growing trend, particularly prevalent for at-home or \u201cchicken shack miners,\u201d as they\u2019re known. BTC Gandalf from the Braiins marketing team told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cChicken shack\u201d miners are the backbone of the Bitcoin network hash rate. It\u2019s incredible to see all the different ways they come up with to mine. They provide an invaluable service in keeping hash rate decentralized.\u201d\n\nArmed with oodles of Bitcoin knowledge, Blake has since tried to orange pill his classmates and even professors. Unfortunately, some of them hold the belief that \u201cBitcoin is a scam.\u201d He has taken it upon himself to set the record straight:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m emailing those teachers being like, Hey, office hours, when are they? Let\u2019s have a chat. You can\u2019t just come out and say Bitcoin is a scam with a Bitcoiner in the room.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the S9 is whirring away in his dorm room, contributing to a network Blake strongly supports and generating 100% \u201cfree money.\u201c\n\nWell, \u201cOther than the $30,000-a-year tuition I pay, but it\u2019s 100% free electricity,\u201d he joked."

It has destroyed a lot of trust and has also left a lot of investors harmed,\u201d Klee explained.\n\nIn such an environment, it\u2019s helpful to hark back to historic Swiss values.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe price of bitcoin is up by almost a third since the start of the year, leading to speculation that the prolonged \u2018crypto winter\u2019 is finally beginning to thaw.\n\nThe world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency was trading above $21,000 on Thursday, pushing its market cap higher than $400 billion for the first time since November.\n\nThe latest gains come amid easing inflation and signs that the US Federal Reserves will slow interest rate rises over the coming months, leading to improved sentiment and an increased appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) have also seen significant gains in recent weeks, pushing the overall crypto market cap back towards $1 trillion.\n\nDespite the turnaround in fortunes, the global crypto currency market remains a long way off its peak of close to $3 trillion in November 2021.\n\nThe upward momentum saw short sellers lose hundreds of millions of dollars in the space of just a few days, according to a report from crypto investment service BitStacker.\n\nThose betting against bitcoin lost $386.74 million in liquidations between 10 to 16 January, the analysis found, with more than $140m lost on just a single day.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s always sad to see traders losing money on their investments, the study does show that cryptocurrencies might finally be bouncing back,\u201d said BitStacker analyst Kris Lucas.\n\n\u201c2022 was a very tough year for cryptocurrencies with the collapse of several major exchanges, as well as the Terra stablecoin. However, the fact that bitcoin is starting to regain its value could suggest that the so-called crypto winter could soon be over.\u201d\n\nView more\n\nA mini flash crash on Wednesday, which saw BTC drop by $1,000 in the space of an hour, demonstrated that the recovery is still in the fragile early stages, and could easily be shaken by some negative news.\n\nThe price dip came after the US government announced a press conference for some major crypto-related news, leading to fears that it could be damaging for the crypto space. The news turned out to be the dismantling of a crime network, and the price returned to a positive trajectory.\n\nThe stalled rally showed that it is too soon to know whether or not bitcoin has reached its lowest price point this cycle, though it is the most positive move for the crypto market in nearly a year.\n\nFavourable market conditions could see bitcoin begin to recapture some of its losses in 2023, according to Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, who cites US inflation data in his forecast for the year ahead.\n\n\u201cWe are technically still in a bear market, but the signs are the bulls are beginning to take back control,\u201d Mr Green told The Independent.\n\n\u201cAs the central banks begin to stop tightening the screws, and the cyclical upturn gets underway, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin could outperform other asset classes. Knowing they are likely to be rewarded for doing so, many crypto investors are positioning themselves now for the pivot.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018crypto winter\u2019 is thawing amid growing signs that inflation is beginning to cool. Of course, the crypto market will not go in a straight line \u2013 no market ever does \u2013 but we expect the bears to go into hibernation and bulls are ready to run.\u201d"

        "title": "5 Best VPNs for Bitcoin Payments in 2024 - ProPrivacy",
        "content": "Paying for your VPN subscription with Bitcoin instead of a credit card is a good way to bolster your privacy at the time of purchase. However, not every VPN service accepts bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (either directly or through an intermediary). In this guide, we have rounded up five of the industry's best services that also accept payment via cryptocurrency for anyone that wants to take an extra step to improve their online privacy.\n\nWhat are the best VPNs that accept Bitcoin?\n\nYou'll find our top VPN picks below \u2013 these services all accept Bitcoin payments, have been carefully vetted by our team of researchers, and come packed with privacy-enhancing features. Keep scrolling to check out our detailed reviews of each provider.\n\nExpressVPN - The best VPN for bitcoin payments. You get access to fast servers all over the globe with excellent encryption. TIP In our testing we checked that all ExpressVPN plans work for Netflix. The one year plan is the best value: three months free and a 30 day risk-free trial. NordVPN - The best value VPN for bitcoin payments, with a huge network of servers, superb encryption, and apps for all devices. Private Internet Access - The best secure VPN for bitcoin payments. Includes a proven no-logs policy and a full suite of customizable features. PrivateVPN - The cheapest VPN for bitcoin payments. Incredibly private and with zero-logs, lots of features, and strong encryption. Surfshark - The best multi-device VPN for bitcoin payments. Offers unlimited simultaneous connections and apps for all your devices.\n\n5 Best Bitcoin VPNs | In-depth analysis\n\nBelow we have listed the best VPN services that accept payment via Bitcoin, If you'd like any more information about these services, take a look at our in-depth review pages.\n\n1. ExpressVPN Editor's Choice | March 2024 www.expressvpn.com ExpressVPN is the best VPN for Bitcoin payments. Consistently quick and works with most major streaming services, and even offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. Pricing 12 months + 3 months FREE + Backblaze backup: $6.67/mth 49% OFF 6 months: $9.99/mth 1 month: $12.95/mth\n\nPros Accepts Bitcoin payments via BitPay Compatible with all devices \u2013 even routers! Superb OpenVPN encryption Works with in-demand streaming services Lots of advanced security features\n\nCons Subscriptions are comparatively expensive Only 5 simultaneous connections No free trial\n\nServer locations 160\n\nSpeeds 100.00 Mbps\n\nUnblocks Netflix iPlayer Amazon Prime Hulu\n\nWebsite www.expressvpn.com\n\nExpressVPN Demo\n\nExpressVPN gives its customers the option to pay for a subscription with Bitcoin via BitPay, which is ideal if you're looking to stay as anonymous as possible! In addition, the service comes stuffed with security features that'll ensure that your personal details stay private. So, whilst an ExpressVPN isn't exactly a budget VPN, you're getting a quality service that consistently sets the bar for its industry peers \u2013 and you can try it without risking a single cent, thanks to a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nBrowsing with confidence, confidentially\n\nDigital security is going to be a priority for most folks interested in paying for their VPN subscription with Bitcoin \u2013 and ExpressVPN doesn't disappoint when it comes to safeguarding privacy. Strong OpenVPN encryption ensures that no third-parties (including your ISP, government, and network administrator) can take a peek at what you're doing online, and I'm glad to see that the ExpressVPN kill-switch, called Network Lock, is automatically activated when you boot up the VPN.\n\n\n\nExpressVPN customers paying with Bitcoin won't even need to reveal their real name\n\n\n\nAs you'd expect from a provider of ExpressVPN's caliber, it abides by a no-logs policy that has been independently audited, and should reassure Bitcoin investors that their connection logs, IP addresses, and browsing history are never stored, and can never be passed on to any nosey authorities. Furthermore, being based in the British Virgin Islands keeps ExpressVPN out of the reach of US and EU jurisdictions.\n\nA free web\n\nExpressVPN boasts an impressive server network with coverage across the globe in 104 countries . This is hugely important if you're going to be accessing streaming services that enforce geo-restrictions! Connecting to an ExpressVPN server is as easy as selecting the location from a list, and once you have, you'll likely be impressed by just how speedy the service is. Whenever I put ExpressVPN to the test, I find that pages load quickly and videos play smoothly, in HD, without any annoying buffering circles.\n\nCustomers will be able to browse the international catalogs of several in-demand streaming services; Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime, and Hulu included. ExpressVPN is also adept at unblocking any social media platforms that might be restricted or banned in your location (or workplace), so you can stay up to date with recent events and all your loved ones. The service's split tunneling feature comes in handy, too, if you'd like to stream geo-restricted content (or scroll endlessly through Twitter) whilst accessing local sites at the same time!\n\nQuality for a price\n\nFew VPN apps look as stylish as ExpressVPN's, frankly. They download in a flash and can be installed on pretty much any device you can imagine \u2013 and that includes smart TVs and consoles, as well as compatible VPN routers. ExpressVPN currently only allows 8 simultaneous connections, however, and other services are beginning to offer more for cheaper.\n\nExpressVPN is a premium provider with a premium price tag, and there's no getting around the fact \u2013 but you get what you pay for. ExpressVPN's security offering is stellar, and customers paying with Bitcoin won't even need to reveal their real name, seeing as a valid email address is all that's required. If you've got any burning questions or need help picking out which server suits your needs best, be sure to reach out to the ExpressVPN customer service team, available 24/7 via live chat and email. 2. NordVPN www.nordvpn.com NordVPN is the best value VPN for bitcoin payments. It provides watertight privacy, works with streaming services around the globe, and has a 30-day money-back guarantee. Pricing 24 months + 3 months FREE: $3.69/mth 70% OFF 12 months: $4.99/mth 59% OFF 1 month: $11.99/mth\n\nPros An audited no-logs policy and superb encryption Accepts Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple payments Server coverage across the globe Superb 24/7 customer support\n\nCons Only 6 simultaneous connections Client UI sometimes has issues Torrenting servers could be easier to find\n\nAccepts Bitcoin? Yes\n\nServer locations 84\n\nSpeeds 58.69 Mbps\n\nUnblocks Netflix iPlayer Amazon Prime Hulu\n\nWebsite www.nordvpn.com\n\nNord Demo\n\nNordVPN accepts payments via Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Ripple \u2013 so prospective customers have some real choice when it comes to paying for a subscription! Total online anonymity is an elusive content, but NordVPN can certainly shore up your security, with well-implemented encryption and a number of must-have features.\n\nAnd remember, you can take NordVPN for a test drive with its 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nCustomize your privacy\n\nAs mentioned earlier, NordVPN gives cryptocurrency investors three ways to purchase their subscriptions with Bitcoin, and real privacy fanatics can even opt to pay for their plan with cash in a retail store! These options prove NordVPN's commitment to security and cement the provider as a top-notch choice, and its AES 256-bit encryption is practically uncrackable, too. In addition, NordVPN users get to choose from a number of protocols, though OpenVPN is the best pick for anyone who wants to keep a low digital profile. To that end, obfuscated (stealth) servers are available, and defeat deep packet inspection by making your VPN traffic look like regular HTTPS.\n\nNordVPN also has its very own customizable kill-switch and offers multi-factor authentication, which I very much recommend using, seeing as it'll make your account way harder for hackers to hijack. When it comes to logs, NordVPN's no-logs claim has been thoroughly audited, so you can rest assured that your identifiable details aren't being squirreled away somewhere. Plus, the service is based in Panama, where there are no mandatory data retention laws!\n\nBeat those restrictions\n\nAny VPN worth its salt will be able to unblock geo-restricted sites and services, and NordVPN is certainly one of the best in the business! Streaming fans will be able to enjoy international content from all the most popular services, like Netflix, BBC iPlayer, and Amazon Prime. In my experience, NordVPN has always been more than capable of handling HD streams \u2013 thanks to its unlimited bandwidth and servers in 61 countries . NordVPN's encryption also puts an end to ISP throttling, which can occur if your ISP figures out you're engaging in data-intensive tasks (like streaming or gaming) and decides to limit your bandwidth.\n\n\n\nNordVPN gives cryptocurrency investors three ways to purchase their subscriptions with Bitcoin\n\n\n\nIf you're more into torrenting, you'll be glad to learn that NordVPN supports P2P activity and port forwarding, so your downloads will be ready in a flash and won't land you in trouble.\n\nFeatures on features\n\nA single NordVPN subscription comes with a whole heap of features \u2013 double VPN is a particularly nice extra, and routes your traffic through two servers to double up your encryption. Similarly, NordVPN's ad-blocking CyberSec features remove annoying ads and malicious websites from your browsing sessions, so you won't have to worry about any accidental mis-clicks or lapses in judgement. Best of all, NordVPN subscriptions are pretty budget-friendly, especially if you invest in one of the long-term plans.\n\nThe service is fully compatible with most platforms, including Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Linux, and users get up to 6 simultaneous connections to play with. Similar to ExpressVPN, this isn't a wholly generous amount, but it's certainly enough to cover all of your most important devices. If you run into any trouble during the setup process, the NordVPN customer service team is on standby, 24/7, to help however they can! 3. Private Internet Access www.privateinternetaccess.com Private Internet Access is the most secure VPNs for Bitcoin. It is famously privacy focused, proving its no-logs claims in court, and offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. Pricing 24 months + 2 months FREE: $2.19/mth 82% OFF 6 months: $7.5/mth 38% OFF 1 month: $11.95/mth\n\nPros Accepts various crypto payments! OpenVPN and WireGuard protocols are available 10 simultaneous connections\n\nCons VPN newcomers might be overwhelmed by advanced options Based in the US No-logs policy has not been audited\n\nAccepts Bitcoin? Yes\n\nServer locations 84\n\nSpeeds 23.93 Mbps\n\nUnblocks Netflix iPlayer Amazon Prime Hulu\n\nWebsite www.privateinternetaccess.com\n\nPIA Demo\n\nPrivate Internet Access (PIA) customers are spoiled for choice when it comes to Bitcoin payments! PIA subscriptions can be purchased via Bitcoin and Bitpay, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum and Litecoin \u2013 and to top it all off, PIA plans are modestly priced, especially if you opt for a long-term subscription.\n\nAs with all good VPNs, you'll be able to try PIA before you buy, with a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nIt's all in the name\n\nPIA has been a favorite of Reddit users for a long time, and has 10 years of experience in the VPN industry \u2013 and that's impressive longevity that's backed up by must-have security features. First and foremost, PIA's AES 256-bit encryption keeps all your browsing sessions secure, regardless of whether you're at home or on the go. OpenVPN and WireGuard protocols are available, and advanced users will even be able to dig in to some seriously customizable security options to tailor the service to their needs! However, even novice users will be able to make good use of the PIA kill-switch, which keeps your original IP address from leaking in the event of a VPN dropout.\n\n\n\nPIA accepts Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin payments\n\n\n\nI'm also glad to see that PIA is a no-logs provider that simply isn't interested in keeping hold of, or recording, user data. Less encouraging is the fact that this no-logs policy has not yet been audited \u2013 and the provider's US headquarters will surely make some users wary, too.\n\nSpeedy streaming\n\nPIA has a massive network of servers in 84 countries across the globe \u2013 though the service claims that it also has a \"domestic focus\" in the United States. This makes PIA a particularly good choice for anyone looking to unblock Netflix US, as well as other US-based streaming services, although PIA is more than capable of accessing all the most sought after streaming platforms! And, thanks to optimized servers and unlimited bandwidth, HD streaming is a breeze, online gaming goes smoothly, and P2P downloads finish in a flash (and torrenters should note that the provider also offers port forwarding).\n\nProtect your network\n\nCurrently, PIA is compatible with all devices; Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Linux included. The service also supports up to Unlimited simultaneous connections \u2013 which is double what you'd get with ExpressVPN or NordVPN! In the unlikely event that you have trouble getting PIA setup, you can call on the 24/7 customer service team to lend a hand.\n\nEarlier, I mentioned that cryptocurrency investors have a number of ways to pay for a PIA plan, and that's entirely true! The provider accepts Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin payments, and doubles down on its commitment to user privacy by allowing customers to purchase or renew subscriptions with gift cards. So, if you have a spare Starbucks, Walmart, or Best Buy gift card lying around, you might want to consider putting it towards a PIA plan! 4. PrivateVPN www.privatevpn.com PrivateVPN is the cheapest VPN for bitcoin payments. With exceptional security features and easy-to-use apps, as well as a 30-day money-back guarantee. Pricing 36 months: $2/mth 84% OFF 3 months: $6/mth 50% OFF 1 month: $9.99/mth 17% OFF\n\nPros Accepts Bitcoin payments Excellent OpenVPN encryption safeguards browsing sessions Supports P2P activity and even has port forwarding\n\nCons No-logs policy has not been audited A smaller pool of servers compared to industry peers No WireGuard support\n\nAccepts Bitcoin? Yes\n\nServer locations 200\n\nSpeeds 23.64 Mbps\n\nUnblocks Netflix iPlayer Amazon Prime Hulu\n\nWebsite www.privatevpn.com\n\nPrivateVPN Demo\n\nPrivateVPN more than lives up to its name, and gives customers the option to purchase their plans with Bitcoins. A PrivateVPN subscription comes with some important security features and serious unblocking power, and we've always been impressed by how reliable this young service is, even when compared against long-standing industry titans.\n\nIf you'd prefer to try PrivateVPN for yourself, on your own devices, you can do so by making good use of the 30-day money-back guarantee. A 7-day free trial is also available, and won't require you to fork over any money at all!\n\nFeature rich\n\nThe last thing any cryptocurrency investor wants is their ISP monitoring every digital move they make. Luckily, PrivateVPN's AES 256-bit encryption can put a stop to this \u2013 and it's fantastic to see that the service also offers OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocols, which are widely considered to be secure, if somewhat resource-intensive. PrivateVPN's kill-switch works nicely with an auto-connect feature, meaning that if your VPN connection drops, you won't need to worry about your original IP leaking, and you'll be able to reconnect to the VPN in a blink.\n\n\n\nNetflix, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime, Hulu \u2013 you name it, and PrivateVPN can probably access it\n\n\n\nTorrenters will certainly appreciate that PrivateVPN offers port forwarding and dedicated stealth servers \u2013 and these come in handy for people living in restrictive regimes with limited access to the web. Likewise, IPv6 and DNS leak protection is a huge plus for the provider, just like its no-logs policy, although I'd like to see the service invest in a third-party audit to allay any lingering concerns.\n\nStream on\n\nIt'd be all too easy to dismiss PrivateVPN as a non-contender, given that it has a smaller pool of servers than its industry peers, but don't count the service out! All of its servers are incredibly quick, and I've always been able to stream smooth, HD content when connected to the service. On that note, PrivateVPN is adept at unblocking all the hottest services from across the globe. Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime, Hulu \u2013 you name it, and PrivateVPN can probably access it. I find PrivateVPN to be particularly good at unblocking restricted YouTube videos, that may not be available in your location or the victims of a network administrator's ban.\n\nCross-platform compatibility\n\nYou'll be able to download PrivateVPN apps for all Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Linux devices, and the VPN is also compatible with selected routers. Users get 10 simultaneous connections to use as they see fit, too. Again, I personally don't think that this is a lot, considering how many internet-enabled devices we tend to have in our homes, but it's a good start \u2013 and a good basis for improvement.\n\nGetting PrivateVPN setup is a breeze, although the VPN's customer service team is on standby during European business hours if you need help at any point during the process. I've reached out to the team on multiple occasions now, and always found their advice to be timely and well-researched \u2013 which is probably because the team is made up of in-house developers! So, remember that 7-day free trial, and put PrivateVPN through its paces without risking a single cent. 5. Surfshark www.surfshark.com Surfshark is the best multi-device VPN for bitcoin payments. Unlimited simultaneous connections, tons of features, and a 30-day money-back guarantee. Pricing 24 months + 2 months FREE: $2.3/mth 83% OFF 12 months: $3.99/mth 70% OFF 1 month: $12.95/mth\n\nPros Unlimited simultaneous connections Unblocks multiple Netflix libraries (and other streaming services) Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple payments accepted\n\nCons Speeds are decent, but not chart-topping Free trial unavailable to Windows users No port forwarding \u2013 a big issue for torrenters\n\nAccepts Bitcoin? Yes\n\nServer locations 140\n\nSpeeds 56.10 Mbps\n\nUnblocks Netflix iPlayer Amazon Prime Hulu\n\nWebsite www.surfshark.com\n\nSurfshark Demo\n\nNo longer the new-kid-on-the-block, Surfshark continues to impress us with top-notch security measures, including OpenVPN encryption and an audited no-logs policy. Bitcoin investors have several options when it comes to purchasing a subscription \u2013 and Surfshark's prices won't break the bank, either!\n\nThis low-cost VPN is well worth a try, and you can do so without risking your hard earned cash (or coins) by taking advantage of the 30-day money-back guarantee, or the 7-day free trial available to Android, iOS, and Mac users.\n\nPay your own way\n\nAs befits a good no-logs VPN service, you can pay for Surfshark using Bitcoin (plus Ripple and Ethereum) using either the Coingate or CoinPayments processors. For such a young service, this is an impressive amount of options, and should highlight Surfshark's intent to prove itself as an industry leader.\n\n\n\nAs befits a good no-logs VPN service, you can pay for Surfshark using Bitcoin (plus Ripple and Ethereum)\n\n\n\nWith Surfshark, you'll also benefit from strong OpenVPN encryption, which prevents any prying eyes from taking a look at your traffic or identifiable details. Whilst I'd always recommend the OpenVPN protocol to the security conscious, WireGuard is a superb alternative, and might be a better pick for folks who want a lightweight solution that balances speed and security. It's also great to see that Surfshark has its own kill-switch \u2013 you'll just need to enable it via the settings menu, first.\n\nCheck out international content\n\nIf you're an avid streamer, you're in luck. Surfshark has no trouble unblocking a long list of in-demand streaming platforms \u2013 including the likes of BBC iPlayer, Prime Video, and a whopping 15 international Netflix libraries. Users get to browse content from overseas in a click, too, and even access social media platforms that have been restricted or otherwise banned in their country, workplace, or school. Surshark is like a digital skeleton key \u2013 it'll unblock and unblock pretty much anything you can think of!\n\nBest of all, actually accessing these streaming platforms with Surfshark is a breeze thanks to a clean and intuitive user interface. Selecting a server is just as easy, too, and there are thousands to choose from! In fact, the VPN boasts coverage across an impressive 100 countries . I really like that Surfshark has a selection of stealth servers. These are invaluable for folks who need to mask their VPN usage, who are living with restrictive internet laws, or who need an additional layer of privacy.\n\nSay goodbye to limits\n\nSurfshark offers its users unlimited simultaneous connections \u2013 and that's serious value for money! It also means that you'll be able to secure all of the internet-enabled devices in your home, or even share the love with friends and family if you're feeling generous. Surfshark apps are also available for just about every platform, are compatible with smart TVs and games consoles, and can travel with you on your mobile phone. So, you've got round-the-clock protection no matter where you are or what device you're using.\n\nBe sure to take advantage of that 7-day free trial (though Winders users will have to miss out), and don't hesitate to contact the Surfshark customer service team with any questions or concerns \u2013 they're around 24/7, after all!\n\nWhat do we mean by a Bitcoin VPN?\n\nMost VPNs these days allow customers to pay for their subscriptions by using a credit or debit card \u2013 and the vast majority accept PayPal, too. Some VPNs may also accept online gift cards and even cash payments. However, very few VPNs are set up to accept Bitcoin payments.\n\nAll the providers in this guide allow subscribers to pay anonymously via Bitcoin \u2013 it's why we chose them in the first place. If done correctly, Bitcoin holders can purchase a VPN subscription without ever having to hand over their real payment details, bank info, or any other personally identifiable information. This adds a crucial extra layer of confidentiality for anyone looking to retain optimum levels of privacy when signing up for a VPN.\n\nHow to pay for a VPN with Bitcoin\n\nAs long as your VPN accepts Bitcoin, you'll be able to make your purchase by following the instructions provided at the checkout.\n\nBear in mind that these instructions may vary from VPN to VPN because different VPNs use different services to receive crypto payments. Speaking generally, however, the steps will be roughly along the lines of those listed below:\n\nPick a VPN provider \u2013 and we'd recommend sticking to one of our hand-picked services that definitely accepts Bitcoin payments. Navigate to the VPN website, select your subscription plan from the options provided, and choose Bitcoin as the payment option when asked. Follow the instructions for BitPay (or whichever third-party payment system the VPN uses). You can usually either login or checkout as a guest. If prompted, enter the appropriate details, such as your email address. You will now receive a Bitcoin address for making a payment and a QR code. You can either scan the QR code with your wallet, or use the wallet address to make the payment manually. Check the amount and confirm the transaction details in your wallet to send the payment to the third-party payment provider. As soon as the payment is confirmed, you'll get an email confirming receipt of the payment, and you can continue signing up for the VPN on its website (this can take up to 24 hours).\n\nHow can I make my Bitcoin wallet anonymous?\n\nIt's entirely possible to make a Bitcoin wallet anonymous. The majority of wallets are stand-alone programs that you run on your own PC and do not require you to supply any form of identification. This means that you can create a wallet address and begin receiving Bitcoin payments in a completely anonymous manner.\n\nThe first thing you'll need to do is to set up the wallet using a pseudonym (username) that's not tied to your real identity in any way. Next, you'll need to set up an email account for the wallet \u2013 and make sure that this isn't connected to your real-life identity either.\n\nIt's vital that you never access the wallet (or the email account) using your actual IP address, as this could allow you to be tracked. Instead, use a VPN to conceal your location (and therefore your identity). Any time that you intend to send funds from your wallet, you'll need to use a VPN to conceal the IP address the funds are being sent from during the transaction. This way, you can maintain your privacy and avoid exposing your identity.\n\nOne thing worth bearing in mind is that a VPN provider could, potentially, be leveraged to trace Bitcoin payments back to your real IP address. For this reason, it is vital to stick to a no-logs/zero-logs VPN that stores no records of what you do while connected to its servers. This will ensure that even if the VPN is served with a warrant, the authorities won't be able to track your online identity, as there'll be nothing to hand over to them!\n\nThe VPN services we've recommended in this article are all zero-logs providers that are well suited for anybody who wants to use their VPN for managing Bitcoins privately and anonymously.\n\nAre cryptocurrency payments anonymous?\n\nCrypto-currencies are not necessarily designed to provide anonymity by default. However, if the proper precautions are taken, cryptocurrency can be used to make anonymous purchases.\n\nDon't fret! Some crypto-currencies are designed with privacy and anonymity in mind \u2013 like Monero and Zcash. Bitcoin isn't actually one of these crypto-currencies, however, but there are ways of acquiring and holding Bitcoin so that they can be spent anonymously.\n\nWhat it is important to remember, is that depending on how you acquire your Bitcoin and store it, the history of those coins and who they belong to may be easy to trace. Thus, in order to purchase a VPN with Bitcoin for added privacy, it is essential to ensure that those coins are not connected to you via an exchange, and have been washed properly with a Bitcoin mixer if necessary.\n\nDo I need to buy my VPN with Bitcoin?\n\nNo, most people don't need to go to these lengths. The vast majority of folks want a VPN to conceal their browsing habits from their Internet Service Provider (ISP) or to ensure that the websites they visit cannot track their real IP address.\n\nIf you feel strongly about purchasing your VPN anonymously; paying with Bitcoin can give you added privacy.\n\nFor those people, a paper trail that reveals that they purchased a VPN subscription at some point is not going to be a massive cause for concern. Thus, they'll be absolutely fine paying with a debit card or PayPal account. However, whether you want to reveal your identity at the time of purchase is largely down to you, and your personal threat model.\n\nCan a VPN help to protect my Bitcoin?\n\nWhenever you use peer-to-peer (P2P) services, you run the risk of revealing your IP address \u2013 be it to cybercriminals, your ISP, the government, or other snooping third parties. As a result, hackers and cybercriminals may use that opportunity to target you with malware and steal your access details for your crypto wallet(s).\n\nUsing a VPN with robust encryption is an excellent way to prevent this from happening. A VPN will conceal your original IP address and encrypt your internet traffic so it can't be intercepted. This puts a barrier between you and anyone wanting to steal your cryptocurrency, as well as giving you greater security and privacy online overall.\n\nCan a VPN allow me to unblock Bitcoin trading sites?\n\nSome countries have cracked down on crypto-currencies like Bitcoin. This can make it hard to access crypto services, exchanges, wallets, and apps. If you want to access a Bitcoin trading site/exchanges like Binance, a VPN is the best solution.\n\nWith a VPN, you can bypass local censorship imposed by the government. Simply connect to a VPN server in a country where purchasing and trading crypto is permitted, and you can access Binance, Coinbase, Cash App, Bisq, or any other cryptocurrency exchange or website service that is currently blocked in your country.\n\nCan I use a free VPN?\n\nIf you're looking to protect your cryptocurrency, then we strongly advise against using a free VPN service. That's not to say there aren't some good ones, but they seldom provide robust enough encryption and security features to justify their use. On top of this, free VPN services will regularly monitor users and sell on their information and usage (pretty much defeating the purpose of a VPN). A good VPN doesn't have to be expensive either. If cost is an issue, check out our top picks for cheap VPNs.\n\nHow does ProPrivacy review VPNs?\n\nThere are a lot of VPNs available on the market in 2024.

Yes, most VPNs that allow crypto payments use advanced payment systems, allowing you to switch from one payment method to another when renewing your subscription. To change your payment method with ExpressVPN, go to Subscription>Change plan>Select a different plan or payment method. The procedure should be similar with other VPNs on this list too.\n\nWhy do some VPNs not accept Bitcoin payments? As a relatively new payment method, Bitcoin payment is still not fully accepted and implemented across all companies and industries. Some innovation-driven VPNs, however (like those in this article), do accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to help you stay more anonymous online."

        "content": "When most people think about bitcoin, they likely think of a shiny new tech industry that operates somewhere in \u201cthe cloud.\u201d\n\nAnnouncements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners CONTEST: Win Two Tickets to Handel One lucky Tyee reader will win a pair of seats to see the famous composer\u2019s music brought to life in Vancouver this March.\n\nMost aren\u2019t imagining an old mill site in the village of Canal Flats, B.C., population 668.\n\nBut over the past five years, cryptocurrency operators have increasingly been setting up shop in the sawdust left by B.C.\u2019s declining forest industry. Inside warehouses that house the operations, the steady hum of computers and a web of wires log thousands of transactions that ping around the globe daily. Their polished stainless-steel interiors reflect a glimmer of hope for communities in decline.\n\nBut the crypto industry has also seen peaks and valleys in recent years \u2014 and not just those of rural B.C.\n\nBitcoin, which makes up almost 40 per cent of all cryptocurrencies, has become increasingly known for its heavy environmental footprint, with the massive computers required to run the industry drawing more power than countries such as Finland and Chile.\n\nThat has brought bitcoin miners to B.C. in search of greener energy. They require three things: sufficient space, a renewable power source and an internet connection. They\u2019ve found it in the old mill sites and industrial infrastructure of forestry towns \u2014 places like Houston, Ocean Falls and, of course, Canal Flats.\n\nBut the jobs provided by the industry \u2014 a few hundred provincewide, by one estimate \u2014 haven\u2019t come close to replacing the void left by forestry. The province\u2019s biggest bitcoin miner, Australia-based Iris Energy, provides about 60 jobs. The company has also been hit by bitcoin\u2019s recent downturn, which has led to a drop in production and fear of layoffs. It now faces a class-action lawsuit in the U.S.\n\nB.C.\u2019s Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation says its announcement last month that it would pause new power requests from cryptocurrency operations has nothing to do with the industry\u2019s volatility and everything to do with preserving B.C.\u2019s power supply.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency mining consumes massive amounts of electricity to run and cool banks of high-powered computers 24/7/365, while creating very few jobs in the local economy,\u201d B.C.\u2019s mines minister, Josie Osborne, said in a news release. Yet unlike mineral mining, which undertakes an approval process under B.C.\u2019s Mines Act, crypto miners only need to request power from BC Hydro.\n\nSeven existing cryptocurrency mining operations and six in the advanced stages of development will be allowed to proceed under the new rules. The province says it is pausing 21 additional projects that are requesting a total of 1,403 megawatts \u2014 more than 10 per cent of the province\u2019s power supply, equivalent to approximately 570,000 homes or 2.1 million electric vehicles.\n\nThe ministry declined to provide details on operations in the province, calling the information \u201ccommercially sensitive.\u201d\n\nIt says the 18-month suspension will provide time to create a \u201cpermanent framework\u201d for the industry \u2014 and to preserve its electricity supply for things like electric vehicles and greening B.C.\u2019s existing economy.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like gold 2.0\u2019\n\nDaniel Roberts visibly stiffens at the mention that bitcoin may be a volatile asset.\n\nThe co-founder and co-CEO of Iris Energy, a company he started with his brother, Will, got his first taste of bitcoin in 2013. Roberts invested just as the digital currency, which had been in existence for about five years at that time, approached $1,000 a coin. Months later, following a high-profile internet security breach, bitcoin plummeted and Roberts\u2019 investment lost nearly half its value.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018This is nonsense\u2019 and sold it all,\u201d the Australian entrepreneur says over a Zoom call from his home in Sydney, jokingly referring to the currency as \u201csilly, magic internet money.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow wrong I was,\u201d he says.\n\nAs Roberts points out, despite bitcoin\u2019s undulating value, the digital currency has trended upward over the past decade. Today, a single coin is worth about C$28,000 \u2014 well above what Roberts paid a decade ago but a far cry from its peak of C$80,000 in 2021.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like gold 2.0,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cWhat gives gold value? Transferability, scarcity, divisibility, durability \u2014 it\u2019s objectively better at being gold than gold is.\u201d\n\nBut some economists disagree.\n\nWerner Antweiler, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia\u2019s Sauder School of Business, has been studying bitcoin since its early days. In a 2011 blog post, he called the currency a terrible idea.\n\nA decade later, his opinion hasn\u2019t changed.\n\n\u201cIt looks a lot like a Ponzi scheme,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people, economists like myself, have looked at it and said, \u2018Wait a minute. This is not a sound business model.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor many, bitcoin\u2019s appeal is that it operates outside traditional markets. It\u2019s not controlled by governments or other regulatory bodies, and its distributed ledgers mean that each transaction is duplicated multiple times around the world. Those ledgers create a blockchain, a history of each transaction meant to provide duplicity and security, and its decentralized nature is appealing to those who distrust central banks.\n\nThe product has no intrinsic value \u2014 or even physical presence. Its value relies solely on the worth assigned by markets. As a result, it leans heavily on hype.\n\n\u201cIn that sense, it\u2019s like buying a piece of art or gold or something, that is essentially just an asset we hold and sell,\u201d Antweiler says. \u201cWhether or not it\u2019s good and holding value, that is completely driven by the market.\u201d\n\nHere in B.C., Antweiler estimates the industry may provide \u201ca few hundred jobs.\u201d But what makes it so egregious, he says, is its wastefulness.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at how much electricity is now being used for bitcoin mining around the world, it\u2019s absolutely shocking,\u201d he says. \u201cI have not yet found anyone who can point me to any significant economic value that could come from using any of these crypto tools or crypto assets and that is, unfortunately, the bottom line.\u201d\n\n\u2018Mopping up\u2019 surplus energy in mill towns?\n\nCryptocurrency operations first began plugging into the B.C. power grid in 2018.\n\nChina had recently shifted from being the global epicenter of cryptocurrency mining to banning the operations in 2017. As some operators sought to green the industry\u2019s image, they looked to B.C., which appeared to have an abundance of renewable power.\n\nThe province\u2019s total generating capacity is more than 12,000 megawatts. An additional 1,100 megawatts are projected to come online once the Site C hydroelectric project is completed in 2024. BC Hydro says its power is 98 per cent renewable, most of it from the province\u2019s many dammed waterways.\n\nAt the start, B.C. cryptocurrency operations drew just a handful of megawatts from the grid. The province appeared keen to attract new business, initially considering a \u201cload-attraction\u201d rate for new cryptocurrency operations.\n\nBut it quickly changed course.\n\nBC Hydro commissioned a load forecast study in 2018 reporting that, by September of that year, formal service requests had grown to 87 megawatts. But the province faced inquiries totalling nearly 2,000 megawatts \u2014 roughly a sixth of its total power supply.\n\nThe report described cryptocurrency as an \u201cemerging\u201d industry, alongside cannabis, that was expected to accelerate demand for power, albeit with a significant amount of uncertainty. \u201cThis is acutely the case for cryptocurrency,\u201d the report added. \u201cThe business viability is ultimately dependent on cryptocurrency prices which are extremely volatile.\u201d\n\nDespite early indications that BC Hydro might offer incentives to cryptocurrency operations, when it announced its Clean Industry and Innovation Rate in 2021, which aimed to attract clean tech industries, it explicitly excluded cryptocurrency.\n\nThat\u2019s \u201cdue to the number of crypto requests to connect,\u201d which showed unprecedented interest from the industry without any incentives, the provincial power regulator explained in an email to The Tyee.\n\nIt was into this shifting landscape that Iris Energy stepped in 2019.\n\nAccording to Roberts, B.C. was facing the combined effects of a declining forest industry coupled with expanded hydroelectric infrastructure. He says the province had a surplus of renewable energy, something that was actually costing ratepayers money.\n\n\u201cWhen you had the pulp and paper industry shut down and the province continued to build out Site C, you end up with this enormous oversupply of energy that someone still has to pay for,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, we thought, let\u2019s come in, let\u2019s go into these regional towns where they\u2019ve been decimated economically by the closure of these mills, leverage a lot of the existing electrical infrastructure, rehire a number of the local workers, retrain them in what we do.\u201d\n\nThe company was \u201cmopping up some of that surplus power\u201d and providing BC Hydro with an alternative revenue line, relieving the burden on residents, Roberts says.\n\nAt the same time, it was greening the bitcoin industry, he adds.\n\nAntweiler calls the claims \u201ccomplete greenwashing.\u201d He says the idea that B.C.-based operations are reducing bitcoin\u2019s environmental footprint goes against the very nature of the industry.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do bitcoin mining only in B.C. That is impossible by the nature of the transaction. The moment bitcoins are mined, they\u2019re mined everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the global footprint that matters.\u201d\n\nIn an email, BC Hydro says that it sells any surplus energy to Powerex, its energy trading branch, which sells clean energy in the western U.S. and Mexico at average wholesale market prices, providing revenue to the Crown corporation.\n\n\u2018The big economic driver is still the forest industry\u2019\n\nIris Energy currently operates three of B.C.\u2019s seven operating cryptocurrency facilities \u2014 in Canal Flats, Mackenzie and Prince George. Combined, they draw 160 megawatts, about 60 per cent of the power dedicated to 13 operations that have been allowed to move forward since the province announcement it would hit pause on new connection requests.\n\nIt was a connection with Vanderhoof businessman Brian Fehr that originally brought the company to B.C., Roberts says.\n\nFehr, an Order of BC recipient, had been buying up old mill sites across the province \u2014 in places like Vavenby, Cranbrook, Isle Pierre and Fort Nelson. Among them was a shuttered Canfor sawmill in Canal Flats, which he retooled as the Columbia Lake Technology Center in 2018, with then-premier John Horgan in attendance at the launch.\n\nThe following year, Iris Energy bought into the venture, establishing its first Canadian operation, which officially launched in 2021.\n\nAt the time, Fehr spoke enthusiastically about more bitcoin operations on the horizon: \u201cWe\u2019re already building in Mackenzie, we\u2019re already working in Chetwynd, we\u2019ve got many sites going now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe went after sites where BC Hydro has a surplus of power.\u201d\n\nBut while Fehr remains an investor in Iris Energy, he is not directly involved in the company\u2019s two recent operations, which opened last year in Mackenzie and Prince George. No operations have yet materialized in Chetwynd, although Fehr bought the town\u2019s sawmill site in March.\n\nRoberts says he can\u2019t talk about the company\u2019s future plans in B.C. but indicates that more mining facilities \u2014 and partnerships with the Brian Fehr Group \u2014 could be in the works.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a number of other development projects that we\u2019re working on with Brian,\u201d he says.\n\nFehr did not respond to The Tyee\u2019s requests for an interview.\n\nBrian Fehr\u2019s sister, Lorri Fehr, is CEO at the Columbia Lake Technology Center and works with her brother on his various business ventures across the province. She says bitcoin was \u201cnot our first strategy.\u201d The family comes from a forestry background and their interests focus on providing economic development opportunities in rural communities.\n\nBut when the siblings met the Roberts brothers, something clicked.\n\n\u201cWhat mattered there was the shared values,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had decided very clearly at the beginning of the Columbia Lake Tech Center that we were only going to offer clean, green, sustainable, First Nations-friendly, community-friendly \u2014 that\u2019s what we want our site to be. These guys from Australia came and they really clicked with those values.\u201d\n\nIn addition to providing about 20 full-time jobs, she says Iris Energy has offered locals in Canal Flats the opportunity to learn entry-level tech skills. Canal Flats Mayor Mark Doherty adds that infrastructure upgrades have also attracted the interest of other technology companies.\n\n\u201cIt does help out the economy here. We would like to see more of that stuff coming here,\u201d Doherty says. \u201cThey employ a lot of people and they\u2019ve been a good steward of the community.\u201d\n\nIronically, while the tech industry has supplied some new employment, it has also taken it away \u2014 the Canal Flats mill had 120 workers when it closed, Doherty says. If it were to start up again today, it would employ fewer than 70 people, a result of technological efficiencies in the forest industry \u2014 but still three times the number of jobs offered on the site as a crypto operation.\n\nMackenzie Mayor Joan Atkinson is also quick to acknowledge that bitcoin isn\u2019t about to replace what was lost with a decline in the forest industry.\n\nAtkinson moved to the community more than 25 years ago for her husband\u2019s work in forestry. Her two sons, now grown but still living in the region, also went on to work in the industry.\n\nThe community of roughly 3,200 residents was founded on forestry. Located two hours north of Prince George, it was one of B.C.\u2019s instant towns, created to service logging operations after the Williston Reservoir opened up new timber to the north. When Atkinson arrived in the late 1990s, there were three sawmills, a large pulp and paper mill and a pulp mill, she says.\n\nThat all changed with an uplift in timber harvest during the mountain pine beetle epidemic and subsequent hauling of timber to mills farther afield. Canfor\u2019s Mackenzie mill closed in 2019, eliminating more than 400 local jobs.\n\n\u201cBut the big economic driver is still the forest industry,\u201d she adds.\n\nToday, the community has a lot going for it, Atkinson says. Real estate prices are among the lowest in the province and it has enough family doctors for everyone. In addition, the town offers easy access to outdoor adventure, with new bike trails, paddling and its own one-lift ski hill.\n\nIris Energy employs about 15 people full time in Mackenzie. They\u2019re jobs Atkinson says the community is happy to take. The company has also purchased industrial land from the district, provided $100,000 in annual community grants and contributes to the tax base \u2014 even if it\u2019s not on the same scale as heavy industry.\n\nShe describes the company as \u201cgood corporate citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t fill the void of a shutdown sawmill,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019re used to the old sawmill days when 40 people showed up for a shift.\u201d\n\nIndustry instability \u2014 and lawsuits\n\nProvincewide, Roberts says Iris Energy employs about 60 people \u2014 10 in Vancouver and the rest spread over its three operations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hired locally, we\u2019ve sourced all our trades and equipment where we can locally and, again, we\u2019d like to think that we\u2019ve contributed to keeping power prices low,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t employ as many people as the pulp and paper industry. But at least we\u2019re coming into these regional communities, adding economic activity and a new level of employment.\u201d\n\nBut last year\u2019s downturn in bitcoin underscored the industry\u2019s instability.\n\nOn Nov. 2, Iris Energy announced that as a result of the drop in bitcoin prices, some equipment was not producing enough revenue to cover more than $100 million in debt on the machines. The loans, which were arranged through \u201cspecial purpose vehicles,\u201d or subsidiaries that provide financing protection to the parent company, were called in by the lenders.\n\nRoberts says that the company is currently \u201creplacing some of the computers\u201d in Canal Flats as a result.\n\nIt means output is down. The company\u2019s hashrate, or computing power, dropped by more than half from October to November 2022.\n\nDespite rumours that the Canal Flats operation could see layoffs, that hasn\u2019t happened, he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s given the guys on site a bit of a breather and an opportunity to catch up on broader things,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cIt means we\u2019re making less cash today than we would have been three months ago, but it\u2019s very much a short-term thing.\u201d\n\nFollowing the November announcement, Iris Energy stocks tumbled to an all-time low. By late December, they bottomed out at US$1.06 \u2014 losing more than 90 percent of their value over November 2021, when the shares entered the market at US$28.\n\nLast month, the class-action lawsuit filed in the U.S. claimed Iris Energy \u201cfailed to disclose material adverse facts\u201d about its business, thereby harming investors. The claims have yet to be proven before the court.\n\nWhen asked about the lawsuit, Roberts demurs.\n\n\u201cI would have to check. I know for a fact that one was lodged and withdrawn very quickly late last year,\u201d he says, blaming market fluctuations and investor anxiety. \u201cWhether there\u2019s another one afoot today, I\u2019d need to go and check. It\u2019s not something that we\u2019re overly concerned with at the moment,\u201d he adds.\n\nRobert Willoughby, investor relations manager with Pomerantz LLP, one of the law firms pursuing the court action against Iris Energy, confirmed that a class-action against Iris Energy is moving ahead.\n\nBC Hydro expresses caution\n\nBoth bitcoin and Iris Energy appear to be rebounding with the new year. Bitcoin\u2019s price has climbed from $22,000 a month ago to $28,000 this week. Iris Energy shares closed at US$1.92 on Wednesday, up from a low point of US$1.06 in December.\n\nRoberts is optimistic. \u201cI think bitcoin is here to stay,\u201d he says, but adds that the infrastructure being built could be used for all types of data.\n\nAlthough the Mines Ministry says bitcoin\u2019s recent downturn had no bearing on its decision to halt new operations, BC Hydro expressed caution about dedicating too much of its power supply to the industry. Moving ahead with the spike in requests would have meant \u201csignificant upgrades\u201d to the province\u2019s energy delivery systems, at a cost to consumers, senior media relations advisor Kyle Donaldson adds.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to keeping rates affordable for our customers and protecting them against a volatile industry that could potentially reduce electricity supply,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have heard from communities and individuals about recent concerns over the state of the cryptocurrency industry and the risks of allocating electricity that puts significant risk on other industries they are looking to attract to their region.\u201d\n\nRoberts says that BC Hydro\u2019s announcement \u2014 which came as the province broke records for residential power use during December\u2019s cold snap \u2014 didn\u2019t come as a surprise.\n\n\u201cWe get it. We welcome it,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end of the day, we want to be solving problems in markets that we go into, we want to be using surplus energy.\u201d\n\nManitoba also suspended new cryptocurrency connections in November and Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec previously undertook a similar process that resulted in higher rates and a cap on electricity for cryptocurrency mining.\n\nAs for what B.C.\u2019s current pause could bring, the Mines Ministry says it\u2019s too soon to say. Antweiler notes that financial regulation ultimately comes from the federal government.\n\nHe adds that now is not the time to be expending energy on a product with questionable value.\n\n\u201cAnyone who\u2019s concerned about climate change can only look at crypto technologies and say, \u2018Do we really need this at a time when we\u2019re trying to reduce our environmental footprint and are concerned about climate change?\u2019\u201d he says."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCryptocurrencies have driven up in the ranks of financial assets held by women, an eToro survey shows, with a jump in ownership in 2022 taking place despite a sharp downturn in the market.\n\nCrypto has become the second most widely owned asset class for women, running just behind cash, the trading platform said this week in its Retail Investor Beat survey.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, 34% of women owned crypto, up from 29% in the third quarter. The increase in the pace of ownership was faster than that of men, as their rate edged up to 43% from 42%.\n\nCrypto appears to be \"succeeding where traditional financial markets have sometimes failed in bringing more women to the table,\" Ben Laidler, global market strategist at eToro, said in the report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWomen ramped up their holdings of digital assets during a so-called crypto winter that saw prices sinking for bitcoin, ether, and other digital coins. Bitcoin's valuation dropped by more than 60% last year, and the market's overall market capitalization fell below its high point of $3 trillion in November 2021 to below $1 trillion now.\n\nThe market ran into macroeconomic turbulence and a number of blow-ups in the crypto world, including the implosion of FTX.\n\nStill, women were part of a broader increase in the proportion of retail investors owning crypto. Overall, crypto was held by 39% of retail investors in the final quarter of 2022, up from 36% in the third quarter, even as it was last year's worst-performing asset class, eToro said.\n\n\"It's important to emphasise that retail investors are overwhelmingly long-term, with 63% holding onto investments for years or decades and just 4% holding them for days,\" said Laidler. \"Time is on their side in most cases and for many, the brutal tech valuation and expectations reset may set up for better returns ahead.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEToro said 10,000 retail investors were surveyed across 13 countries between December 14 and 24."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell from an all-time price high of close to $69,000 in November 2021 to below $16,000 in November 2022 (Getty Images/ iStock)\n\nThe price of bitcoin is up by almost a third since the start of the year, leading to speculation that the prolonged \u2018crypto winter\u2019 is finally beginning to thaw.\n\nThe world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency was trading above $21,000 on Thursday, pushing its market cap higher than $400 billion for the first time since November.\n\nThe latest gains come amid easing inflation and signs that the US Federal Reserves will slow interest rate rises over the coming months, leading to improved sentiment and an increased appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) have also seen significant gains in recent weeks, pushing the overall crypto market cap back towards $1 trillion.\n\nDespite the turnaround in fortunes, the global crypto currency market remains a long way off its peak of close to $3 trillion in November 2021.\n\nThe upward momentum saw short sellers lose hundreds of millions of dollars in the space of just a few days, according to a report from crypto investment service BitStacker.\n\nThose betting against bitcoin lost $386.74 million in liquidations between 10 to 16 January, the analysis found, with more than $140m lost on just a single day.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s always sad to see traders losing money on their investments, the study does show that cryptocurrencies might finally be bouncing back,\u201d said BitStacker analyst Kris Lucas.\n\n\u201c2022 was a very tough year for cryptocurrencies with the collapse of several major exchanges, as well as the Terra stablecoin. However, the fact that bitcoin is starting to regain its value could suggest that the so-called crypto winter could soon be over.\u201d\n\nA mini flash crash on Wednesday, which saw BTC drop by $1,000 in the space of an hour, demonstrated that the recovery is still in the fragile early stages, and could easily be shaken by some negative news.\n\nThe price dip came after the US government announced a press conference for some major crypto-related news, leading to fears that it could be damaging for the crypto space. The news turned out to be the dismantling of a crime network, and the price returned to a positive trajectory.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stalled rally showed that it is too soon to know whether or not bitcoin has reached its lowest price point this cycle, though it is the most positive move for the crypto market in nearly a year.\n\nFavourable market conditions could see bitcoin begin to recapture some of its losses in 2023, according to Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, who cites US inflation data in his forecast for the year ahead.\n\n\u201cWe are technically still in a bear market, but the signs are the bulls are beginning to take back control,\u201d Mr Green told The Independent.\n\n\u201cAs the central banks begin to stop tightening the screws, and the cyclical upturn gets underway, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin could outperform other asset classes. Knowing they are likely to be rewarded for doing so, many crypto investors are positioning themselves now for the pivot.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018crypto winter\u2019 is thawing amid growing signs that inflation is beginning to cool. Of course, the crypto market will not go in a straight line \u2013 no market ever does \u2013 but we expect the bears to go into hibernation and bulls are ready to run.\u201d"

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are leading the weekly gains among the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market cap as their prices soared 11.2% and 9.7%, respectively.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was changing hands at $20,981, up 1% over the day, with Ethereum trading at $1,551, up 2% in the past 24 hours, data from CoinGecko shows.\n\nThese are by far the best results among the market\u2019s largest crypto assets, with the sixth-placed XRP gaining 5% over the past week, followed by Polygon (MATIC), which is up 4.3% over the same span.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe solid performance shown by the two leading cryptocurrencies comes despite the Wednesday correction that occurred in anticipation of a major announcement from U.S. federal prosecutors that many thought would target a major player in the sector.\n\nThough markets indeed felt the pinch, with both BTC and ETH plunging about 5% immediately after the announcement of the announcement, the correction turned out to be largely short-lived as the criminal charges were filed against a little-known Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitzlato, which the Feds called of a key member of a so-called \u201ccrypto crime axis.\u201d\n\nThe latest move has also been seen in the hefty rise in the entire market's capitalization. This time last week, the crypto market hovered around a $943 billion capitalization; today, that figure is over $1 trillion.\n\nHas Bitcoin bottomed yet?\n\nWith Bitcoin eyeing the key $21,000 level, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has once again surpassed the $1 trillion mark, something experts see as a sign of the market\u2019s potential recovery after the painful crypto winter of 2022.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko\u2019s recent annual crypto industry report, last year, which saw the demise of several high-profile players, ended with a total crypto market capitalization of $829 billion, which is 64.1% lower than the $2.3 trillion in January 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDaily trading volumes have steadily trended downwards over 2022 as well, averaging at $86.0 billion, said the report.\n\nSource: CoinGecko.\n\n\u201c2022 marked a turning point for the crypto industry\u2014one that flushed out unsustainable excesses from the bull run,\u201d CoinGecko co-founder Bobby Ong said in a statement shared with Decrypt. \u201cIn this new year, we hope to see crypto slowly make a recovery, with more efforts going towards rebuilding trust and credibility.\u201d\n\nAs for last week\u2019s performance beyond the top ten, the three top gainers performers are Solana (SOL), which is up 28.5% over the past week, the Ethereum-based meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB), whose price rallied 20.7% over the span, and Polkadot (DOT) with a 10.9% surge."

Blockchain is a technology ledger system that we use to move information. We\u2019ve used it to do overnight repo, intraday repo. We\u2019ve used it to move money.

        "content": "Bitcoin price trades strongly above the $20,000 psychological level and shows signs of another upside move above $21K. Five on-chain indicators also signal that Bitcoin has entered an early bull market cycle.\n\nThe crypto market recovered slightly after the U.S. DOJ enforcement action against Russian crypto exchange Bitzlato. Crypto Twitter blames DOJ for creating much hype surrounding small news that caused panic selling across the crypto market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFive On-Chain Indicators Indicate More Upside in Bitcoin Price\n\nAccording to on-chain data by CryptoQuant, Bitcoin price has entered the early bull market cycle and is likely to move higher with promising momentum in the next few days.\n\nBitcoin movements from spot to derivative exchanges have increased as investors started taking risks. Traders generally transfer their coins to derivative exchanges to increase their market upside exposure. It helps them make more profits during a market recovery.\n\nThe MVRV Ratio indicates if the Bitcoin price is undervalued or overvalued. It is derived from Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization (market price) divided by its actual market capitalization. Currently, MVRV is 1.07 and moving near the 365-day moving average (orange line). Thus, it indicates Bitcoin is about to start a new uptrend.\n\nThird indicator, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss shows the average profit margin of Bitcoin holders. It is also near the 365-day moving average and indicates an early bull market cycle.\n\nPuell Multiple is the ratio of the daily dollar worth of newly issued bitcoins to their one-year moving average. At present, the indicator shows a shift to a positive trend as Bitcoin price holds strongly above its 365-day moving average.\n\nCryptoQuant\u2019s P&L Index indicator combines the MVRV ratio, Net Unrealized Profit/Loss, and LTH/STH SOPR into a single Bitcoin value indicator. The P&L Index points to an early Bitcoin bull market cycle as the index (dark purple line) looks to cross the 365-day moving average (light purple line)\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Really Bottomed? Use These To Confirm Market Bottom\n\nBTC Price Await Upside Momentum\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price fell nearly 2% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $20,774. The 24-hour low and high are $20,541 and $21,564, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased by 21% in the last 24 hours, indicating an increase in interest.\n\nTraders should keep an eye on the US dollar index (DXY). A fall in the DXY below 102 at current market conditions will confirm a rally in Bitcoin price.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Linked With Exchange Accused Of Money Laundering"

This kind of digital ledger is designed to be difficult to alter or hack and enables the creation of a public record of transactions.\n\nHe said: \u201cBlockchain is a ledger system that we use to move information... to move money. It's a technology we think will be deployable.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to CNBC, Mr Dimon added he could envisage the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates above 5pc as central bankers grappled to get a hold of raging inflation.\n\nMr Dimon said: \u201cI actually think rates are probably going to go higher than 5pc. There's a lot of underlying inflation, which won't go away so quick.\u201d\n\nThe US Federal Reserve has predicted rates will rise from around 4.5pc to about 5pc by the end of the year, and remain there.\n\nMr Dimon's comments on Bitcoin come as financial institutions emerge red faced from the failure of FTX, the world's second largest cryptocurrency exchange, which collapsed amid allegations of fraud.\n\nFinancial giants including Blackrock and venture capital fund Sequoia had invested in the digital currency exchange, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nMr Bankman-Fried has been arrested and accused of \u201cmassive\u201d fraud by US authorities. He is alleged to have siphoned customer money to pay for luxury properties and to prop up losses at a crypto hedge fund. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nLast year, the price of Bitcoin plunged by more than 60pc amid a sell-off of cryptocurrencies accelerated by a series of scandals and collapses throughout the digital asset industry.\n\nHowever, so far in 2023 the price of the digital currency has recovered. One Bitcoin is now worth \u00a316,880, up 23pc since the start of January."

        "content": "In April 2022, about the same time that Founders Fund sold out of most of its cryptocurrency holdings, Mr Thiel said he was optimistic about the future of bitcoin. He told a cryptocurrency conference in Miami that \u201cwe\u2019re at the end of the fiat money regime\u201d and suggested its price \u2013 which was then trading at about $US44,000 \u2013 could increase by a factor of 100.\n\nMr Thiel said JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon and BlackRock boss Larry Fink \u201cneed to be allocating some of their money to bitcoin\u201d, adding: \u201cWe need to push back on them.\u201d\n\nThe price of bitcoin, which was launched in 2009, surged dramatically from roughly $US750 in 2014 to an all-time high of more than $US65,000 by November 2021. However, its price has been volatile in recent years, with several big collapses in value, including a drop to about $US15,500 in November last year, a two-year low.\n\nThe digital assets market has been rocked by a crisis since May last year, forcing high-profile crypto companies such as Terraform Labs, Celsius, Voyager and Three Arrows Capital into bankruptcy.\n\nMarket sentiment towards crypto was damaged further in November when FTX, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, shut down owing creditors more than $US3 billion, and its co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried faced multiple fraud charges.\n\nBy December, bitcoin had lost about three-quarters of its value from its peak and more than $US2 trillion had been wiped off the value of the global crypto market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral blue-chip Silicon Valley investors have piled into digital currencies in recent years, although most have focused their investments on equity stakes in crypto businesses rather than buying cryptocurrencies directly.\n\nSome exceptions to this include A16z crypto \u2013 the crypto arm of venture firm Andreessen Horowitz \u2013 which raised a $US4.5 billion fund last year and also invests directly in crypto coins and tokens.\n\nSimilarly, Paradigm, a crypto venture firm founded in 2018 by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang, raised a $US2.5 billion fund in late 2021.\n\nBut many large financial institutions stayed away from cryptocurrencies over fears about cybersecurity and their links to money laundering and drug trafficking. In 2017, JPMorgan\u2019s Dimon called bitcoin a \u201cfraud\u201d.\n\nFounders Fund\u2019s shift on crypto, which had been one of its core positions, was one of about nine big exits the venture fund made between 2020 and the end of last year that allowed it to return roughly $US13 billion to investors.\n\nOther exits also included the initial public offerings of companies it had backed since their early fundraisings, such as Airbnb and Palantir, the data analytics group that Mr Thiel co-founded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Thiel co-founded PayPal in 1998 and went on to become one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most successful investors, including being the first venture capitalist to back Facebook.\n\nFounders Fund has more than $US11 billion under management, including $US5 billion of capital raised across two funds last year, and has taken stakes in more than 100 companies, such as Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, ride-hailing app Lyft and defence tech group Anduril.\n\nThe fund is in talks to take an equity stake in OpenAI, the developer behind chatbot ChatGPT, at a valuation of $US29 billion.\n\nFinancial Times"

I am not selling anything, nor promoting.\"\n\n\"If someone made bad decisions and lost money,\" Chobanian added, \"it's their fault and not my car's.\"\n\nIn other words, neither the Davos Bitcoin-mobile nor its testy owner are responsible for the 2022 crypto crashes.

        "content": "At a time when a strong start to 2023 has upped crypto investors' hopes for the industry\u2019s bounce back this year, the CEO of the US\u2019 biggest bank, JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, has bashed cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin Is Itself A Hyped-Up Fraud\"\n\nunsplash\n\nOn being asked about bitcoin at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, JP Morgan's CEO told CNBC at the event \u201cWhy they waste any breath discussing the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud, a pet rock.\u201d\n\n\n\nA few months ago, the US banking giant's CEO also warned about a recession hitting the US as well as the global economy in the middle of 2023.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Why JPMorgan Was Fined $200mn For Using Whatsapp\n\n\"Not Surprised With FTX Failure\"\n\nThe JPMorgan CEO also weighed in on the ongoing saga with bankrupt crypto exchange FTX.\n\nReuters\n\nCEO Dimon stated that he was not surprised to see FTX fail and declare bankruptcy, and referred to it as a Ponzi scheme.\n\nWhen asked if he thought the cryptocurrency sector as a whole was a Ponzi scheme, he said, \"You guys have all seen the analysis of Tether and all these things, the lack of disclosures, it's outrageous. Regulators should have stopped this a long time ago. People have lost billions of dollars if you look at its lower-income people, in some cases retirees.\"\n\n\n\nThis isn't the first time JPMorgan's CEO has bashed cryptocurrencies. Jamie Dimon has been a vocal opponent of Bitcoin for a long time. Last year, he compared Bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme, like the infamous, decades-long scam run by Wall Street titan Bernie Madoff, as per a Forbes report.\n\nAlso Read: RBI Governor Says Next Financial Crisis Will Come From Private Crypto\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Crypto & Blockchain Projects\n\nreuters\n\nWhile JPMorgan\u2019s CEO does seem to be totally against Bitcoin and crypto in general, it\u2019s clear that as the biggest bank in the US, the company understands the need to hedge their bets.\n\n\n\nThe company is actively involved in the development of blockchain implementations into their services, and they\u2019ve even created their own proprietary token, JPM Coin. This token has a specific use case within their system, being used for intraday repurchase agreements, as the report mentioned.\n\nAlso known as repos or RP, intraday repurchase agreements are short-term loans involving financial institutions. They\u2019re used by big banks to help manage their short-term cash flow or to meet regulatory capital adequacy requirements.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. Last year, in November, JPMorgan Chase also registered a trademark for a new cryptocurrency wallet. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted JPMorgan Chase Bank\u2019s trademark registration for \u201cJ.P. Morgan Wallet\u201d for use in a wide range of financial services, including virtual currency transfers and exchanges as well as crypto payment services. It had applied for it in 2020.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Will Collapse One Day, Says Rakesh Jhunjhunwala\n\nFor the latest and interesting financial news, keep reading Indiatimes Worth. Click here."

Bitcoin mining is best started using the bitqt platform.\n\nThe behavior of Bitcoin in the digital financial market makes the other digital currencies follow in its footsteps, assuming if it all rises and if the opposite is the case, they all move after the first in cryptographic market capitalization.\n\nThe collapse of prices during 2022 has been abrupt, leading Bitcoin to a price that decreased more than 60% from its last historical maximum registered in 2021, which has undoubtedly reduced the other digital instruments, even leading them to disappear.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nBitcoin characteristic volatility\n\nBefore the latest bitcoin and cryptocurrency price surge, in a survey of mostly bank executives, Forbes found that most thought bitcoin and digital assets could replace fiat currencies like the US dollar in the next five or ten years.\n\nOn the other hand, other financial analysts warn that there is still a long way to go before cryptocurrencies have a massive adoption that makes them huge as a unit of account and currency of exchange, as well as a store of value.\n\nThis process began to accelerate, mainly after the decision of the payment company PayPal to incorporate Bitcoin as a means of payment. Later, several firms, including Tesla, began to flirt with Bitcoin as a payment currency.\n\nAt the same time, we must not fail to highlight the environmental challenges, considering the high energy consumption required by mining currencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nIt should be remembered that the price of the leading crypto assets tends to experience high volatility despite showing a long-term upward trend.\n\nBlockchain and central banks\n\nThe modernization of traditional banking is under pressure due to the versatility and security offered by the blockchain in terms of recording and monitoring of operations, where no one can alter them, which has led these institutions to consider the creation of digital currencies to diversify their service portfolio and streamline international processes to compete with the cryptocurrency model.\n\nWe could be facing a scenario of updating traditional banking, where the processes could be more transparent, less cumbersome, and without so much bureaucracy involved, as well as the opportunity is given to users to be the owners of their capital without the possibility of executing a transaction is in the hands of third parties.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nIt is projected that the euro and the digital dollar will not replace each other\u2019s fiat currency; they will only complement the need to make electronic payments.\n\nBitcoin is a market capitalization that came out of nowhere\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies have the potential to become an alternative asset class, their prices are likely to remain highly volatile and attract more speculative investors, the Swiss Financial Services Company (UBS) noted.\n\nMassive dollar liquidity and network effects are the most substantial headwinds against Bitcoin\u2019s rise, Voorhees told Decrypt, noting that Bitcoin has gone from nothing to a trillion-dollar market cap for a decade. . \u201cBitcoin is gaining its network effect over time,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are still many people who do not know what cryptocurrencies are, and even more who have heard of them but do not understand them; only when this happens Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency will have taken over.\n\nBitcoin is here to stay, leading the digital cryptocurrency market, demonstrating year after year how its volatility has shown it to have incredible value and still without knowing how much it will be worth in a few years.\n\nConclusions\n\nAll this has created significant uncertainty, and for this reason, it has come to be thought that it can replace one of the most important currencies in the world, but to achieve this goal, a massive adaptation to a new digital world must occur market for many, uncertain for others.\n\nIt is not as easy as it is said, but every day we are more on the path to transcending a digital world controlled by this crypto-asset market.\n\nAt the moment, it is hard to assume that cryptocurrencies can replace the dollar or any other strong currency on the market; however, it does not have any support; It is the currency that countries recognize as par excellence.\n\nOver the years, electronic transactions will continue to replace the use of physical money, where cryptocurrencies will act to position themselves as the digital currency par excellence."

In this line, a Finbold report indicated that crypto adoption accelerated in 2022 despite the prevailing bear market.\n\nSuarez\u2019s decision to receive a portion of his salary in Bitcoin is a notable move, as it highlights public officials\u2019 and institutions\u2019 growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor instance, New York City\u2019s mayor Eric Adams also announced that he would receive his first three paychecks in Bitcoin as a vote of confidence in the maiden cryptocurrency.\n\nMiami\u2019s crypto city initiative\n\nIt is worth noting that the mayor of Miami has been advocating for crypto businesses to set up bases in the city, aiming to make it a digital asset capital of the United States.\n\nAs reported by Finbold, Suarez was at some point influential in attempting to lure Chinese Bitcoin miners into setting up shop in the city after the activity was banned in the Asian country.\n\nThe official indicated he would spur conversations with power distributors to lower energy prices, considering miners prefer operating in regions with cheaper electricity.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Want to mine Bitcoin using solar panels? Here's how many you'll need - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Mining is one of the most popular ways for individuals and organizations to earn cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) through passive income, but critics have often drawn attention to the energy used up in the process of transaction verification using the Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm.\n\nWith this in mind, crypto YouTuber Drew Vosk has looked into a more ecologically acceptable way to produce electricity for Bitcoin mining \u2013 solar panels \u2013 and has analyzed the numbers in a video published on his channel on January 18.\n\nCrunching the numbers\n\nThe basic formula to calculate how many solar panels are needed for a mining rig includes taking one\u2019s monthly electric usage, dividing it by monthly peak sun hours, and multiplying the result by 1,000. Then, the resulting number is divided by the power rating of the solar panel.\n\nFormula to calculate how many solar panels are needed to mine BTC. Source: VoskCoin\n\nPutting this in practice, an Antminer S19 uses 72 kWh per day, which multiplied by 30 days equals 2,160 kWh per month. This number is then divided by the number of monthly peak sun hours, say 156, which gives 13,84. Multiplying this by 1,000 results in 13,846 watts.\n\nThen, taking a standard 400-watt solar panel, this number is divided by 400, which gives 34.6. Rounded off, this means 35 solar panels are needed to run one mining rig. In other words, you would need a 14kWh solar system to mine Bitcoin using solar power.\n\nVosk also advises keeping in mind that how much energy one can earn from the sun varies with their location on Earth. For example, this would never be feasible in London, United Kingdom, as nearly twice as many solar panels would be needed due to its weather.\n\nCostly endeavor\n\nIn the United States, 15kWh of solar panels costs $31,191 thanks to the tax breaks on buying them (without tax breaks, this number would be $42,150). In terms of return on investment, $31,000 to power one Bitcoin miner 24/7 would be a rather expensive endeavor.\n\nTo put this into perspective:\n\n\u201cAt 10 cents per kWh, you could pay your electric company 10 years at current rates to operate this miner instead of setting up the solar panels. When you deal with solar energy, we\u2019re talking years \u2013 not months, not weeks, definitely not days \u2013 as far as ROI, break-even,\u201d Vosk said.\n\nHowever, the crypto YouTuber also believes that \u201cnothing is cooler than generating your own electricity\u201d and \u201cwhen you throw the electric waste argument out the window when it comes to crypto and especially mining, well, then it\u2019s truly a beautiful and powerful, indisputable thing.\u201d\n\nBut is it profitable?\n\nThat said, setting up a solar power system for a farm of 10 mining units would cost about $258,000. Right now, the break-even period would be projected to be about 10 years. Running 25 units would require about $645,000 in the solar setup, and an investment of $1,790,000 would be needed to deploy 50 mining units. However, the monthly mining income from this would be about $29,730.\n\nFor instance, an innovative and eco-friendly Bitcoin mining pool, PEGA Pool, offers miners that use renewable energy only 1% mining fees, which is half of the industry standard of 2%, thus increasing mining profitability.\n\nAlthough Vosk admits that solar-powered Bitcoin mining would take a long time to break even, he stresses to \u201ckeep in mind Bitcoin\u2019s low \u2013 all you need to do is \u2018hodl\u2018 some coin, things go decently, and that number will dramatically decrease,\u201d as well as that \u201call Bitcoin all-time highs have been preceded by a new Bitcoin halving.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the first solar-power Bitcoin mining plant in South Australia has recently opened, providing about five mW of electricity in an effort to curb the carbon footprint of mining the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset.\n\nIn March 2022, Finbold reported on Peter Egyed, also known as AZ Hodl, installing an off-grid solar array to power his Bitcoin mining operation and shared the results of his findings, according to which he expected to make an ROI within 36 months.\n\nWatch the entire video below:"

        "content": "BTC price formed a double bottom pattern and have succeeded to breakout of neckline resistance at $18,385\n\nBitcoin crypto price had sustained above 50 day EMA but it is struggling to breakout of the 200 day EMA hurdle\n\nBTC price is showing signs of long term base formation near $20,000\n\nBitcoin price is trading with mild bullish cues and bulls are attempting to break out of the 200 day EMA. According to Coingalss, $21,000 strike price holds a Call open interest at 15.27K BTC and Put at 3.97K BTC which clearly indicates the strength of buyers. Currently, The pair of BTC/USD is trading at $20,821.76 with an intraday gains of 0.71% and the 24-hour volume to market cap ratio at 0.0745\n\nBTC price turned bullish and formed three white shoulder pattern\n\nSource : BTC/USD daily chart by Tradingview\n\nOn a daily time frame, BTC price had shown a surprising rally of 3000 points in a short span of time and formed a double bottom bullish reversal pattern. From the past couple of months BTC price got stuck in the narrow range between $15,500 to $18,000 and experts have turned highly bearish and are expecting more downside in the BTC prices but market chooses the opposite direction and shot up 32% approx from the lows.\n\nBTC price had succeeded to reclaim the 50 day EMA (yellow)which had reversed the short term trend in the favor of bulls but unfortunately the positional trend is still in the bear grip as prices struggled at the 200 day EMA(green). However, In the coming weeks, If BTC bulls will be able to break out of the 200 day EMA and $21,500 hurdle level we may see the next phase of rally in the short span of time which can take BTC to the $25,000 level\n\nAccording to technical analysis, BTC prices are expected to consolidate in the range between $18,500 to $25,000 in the coming months and if any minor correction triggers from the higher level, it will provide an opportunity for investors and traders to build fresh long positions. On the lower side $18,000 and $16,000 will act as a demand zone for investors. The MACD had generated positive crossover but the curve is sloping sideways denotes prices are lacking the momentum near the supply zone and the RSI at 78 denotes the overbought level.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin prices had shot up 30% from the lows and formed a three white shoulder bullish pattern which indicates the buyers dominance on the lower levels. The technical analysis suggests that BTC price may enter into the short term consolidation but eventually it will break out of upside. Therefore, traders may look for buying opportunities for the target of $25,000 and above by keeping $18,500 as SL. However if prices slipped below $18,500 bears may try to test $16,000 again.\n\nTechnical levels\n\nResistance levels : $21,500 and $25,100\n\nSupport levels : $18,000 and $16,000\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.
