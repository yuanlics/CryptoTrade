        "title": "The 'Budget Ryan Reynolds' Taking Bitcoin FC to the Big Leagues - WIRED",
        "content": "A melt, a muppet, a fraud, a bungler, a Judas, a taker of bribes. A good boy, a lad, a maestro, a beauty. To the crowd at Real Bedford Football Club on a sun-bleached evening in August, the referee was all of these things within the span of half an hour. The Bedford fans, separated from the soccer field by a crooked metal railing and about a meter, held a running dialog with the players throughout the game: \u201cNumber 3! Number 3!\u201d shouted Simon, one especially vocal supporter, \u201cThat was a fucking exquisite touch!\u201d Number 3 returned a knowing grin and a thumbs up.\n\nThis is nonleague, semiprofessional English soccer: the ninth rung of the national ladder, where players are paid tens of pounds per week, not tens of thousands, and matches attract at best a few hundred spectators. The regulars know one another well\u2014they live and mostly work nearby. The game was a replay of an earlier match against F.C. Clacton, from a coastal town 100 miles away, the winner of which would go on to the next round of the FA Cup, the oldest and most prestigious knock-out tournament in England. The previous encounter had ended in a large-scale brawl and a 2-2 tie.\n\nSoccer at this level is rarely glamorous, but Real Bedford\u2019s new owner and chair, Peter McCormack, has the grand ambition of taking the club to the Premier League, the top flight of English soccer. McCormack, who took over the club in April 2022, made his money first in advertising, then by investing in Bitcoin and producing Bitcoin-related content. He is a prominent member of the cryptocurrency community, courtesy of his podcast, What Bitcoin Did, and his plan is to parlay his standing in the crypto world into an international fanbase and lucrative sponsorship for Real Bedford.\n\nThis match, like all home games, is being streamed live on YouTube. The club has set up fan groups across the globe\u2014from Ghana and Tanzania to China and Cambodia. The club badge and shirts bear the Bitcoin logo, in an attempt to turn it into something for all Bitcoiners to rally behind. And big-name sponsors have followed, like Gemini, the crypto exchange run by the Winklevoss twins.\n\nRags to riches stories are few and far between in English soccer, and the blending of crypto and sports has previously led to hostilities between clubs and their fans. But McCormack is confident that this time will be different, and he\u2019s taking a decidedly hands-on approach to prove it.\n\nMcCormack had agreed to host me at the match, but it soon became clear he wouldn\u2019t be able to complete our first interview. Three hours before kickoff, he was busy laying out merch, curating the changing room playlist, and shuttling boxes of gear from the trunk of his car. Later, I squeezed in a few questions while he was marshaling the car park, but the rest would have to wait. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You ask someone else to do something, they won\u2019t do it properly,\u201d he said over his shoulder, as he jogged off to intercept another wayward driver."

        "title": "Bitcoin sees sudden 4% uptick after investors anticipate lower likelihood of interest rate hike in September - Fortune",
        "content": "The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped almost 4%, to nearly $26,800, on Wednesday, and held above $26,000 for over 24 hours. As of Thursday morning, Bitcoin still was hovering around $26,100.\n\nThe total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies, about $1.06 trillion, showed a 1% day-over-day increase. The crypto market\u2019s upswing mirrors a rise in the stock market, as the S&P 500 is also up about 1%, and the Nasdaq 2%.\n\nAnalysts attributed the rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price to poor PMI\u2014Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index\u2014numbers, a proxy for economic trends in the manufacturing and service industries. Lower PMI numbers indicate a shrinking market, which bodes well for a reduction in inflation and \u201csuggests a lower likelihood of a rate hike in September,\u201d according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, a European alternative assets manager.\n\nJoel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Digital, a crypto exchange for institutional investors, echoed Butterfill\u2019s analysis. \u201cThe primary fundamental catalyst for the move higher comes from traditional markets,\u201d he told Fortune in an email. \u201cWith stocks rallying, and the U.S. dollar selling off, Bitcoin was able to benefit.\u201d\n\nThe rally in Bitcoin\u2019s price follows a precipitous drop last week in which it took a nosedive of almost 8%, pulling down the rest of the crypto market with it. The recent ups and downs of Bitcoin\u2019s price also come amid a period of relative stability for the historically volatile asset. Its 90-day volatility rate was recently the lowest it\u2019s been since 2016.\n\nThose comparatively placid waters stand in contrast to Bitcoin\u2019s surging price throughout 2023. In January, it was less than $17,000. However, amid the banking crisis in March, which most famously felled Silicon Valley Bank, Bitcoin surged to almost $28,000.\n\nAfter stalling for two months, the digital asset skyrocketed past $31,000 following BlackRock\u2019s application for a Bitcoin spot ETF, a move that many saw as a resounding mark of approval for the cryptocurrency, given that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is a titan in the financial industry.\n\n\u201cThe primary reason we haven\u2019t seen significant price surges, even with the current economic landscape and favorable valuation metrics,\u201d Butterfill of CoinShares told Fortune, \u201cis because investors are currently in a holding pattern, awaiting the SEC\u2019s verdict on the approval of a spot-based ETF in the U.S.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin back at US$26,500 as cryptos mirror Wall Street gains - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Thursday morning in Asia to trade in the US$26,500 range. The token logged its biggest one-day increase for the past six weeks on Wednesday, making up some of the losses from last week\u2019s nosedive. Ether also moved up to challenge the US$1,700 resistance level, while all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher. The rise across cryptocurrencies mirrored a rally in the U.S. equity market on Thursday. S&P Global\u2019s purchasing manager\u2019s index for August showed a slowdown in the U.S. economy, mitigating inflation and rate hike concerns.\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL led the crypto winners after Solana Pay announced a partnership with Shopify to allow USDC payments on the e-commerce platform. The Forkast 500 NFT index fell as OpenSea\u2019s decision to stop enforcing creator royalties continues to impact the market. Meanwhile, U.S. AI chipmaker Nvidia released a better-than-expected earnings report which drove a 6% rise in the firm\u2019s shares and a boost for U.S. equities.\n\nCryptos benefit from Wall Street gains\n\nBitcoin rose 2.23% in the last 24 hours to US$26,510.04 as of 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, but lost 8.11% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached a seven-day high of US$26,786.90 on Wednesday, a jump of over 3.7% from its daily low of US$25,806.99.\n\nThe rise in Bitcoin came on the back of a Wall Street rally. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted gains of more than 1% at close of trading Wednesday. That followed the release of S&P Global\u2019s flash U.S. Composite PMI index \u2014 a measurement of economic activity in both the manufacturing and service sectors.\n\nThe index showed that economic growth in August was close to stalling. Investors were hopeful that a slowdown in consumer spending could lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to pause its cycle of interest rate increases \u2014 good news for the crypto market playing out in today\u2019s price increases.\n\nCoinGlass data showed total Bitcoin liquidations at US$39.08 million over the past 24 hours. That included US$9.65 million of long positions \u2014 positions where investors bet the cryptocurrency price will rise.\n\nIt was the first time since August 20 that liquidations on Bitcoin short positions \u2014 which totaled US$29.43 \u2014 surpassed long position liquidations, indicating an improvement in investor sentiment.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ether gained. It rose 3.04% to US$1,681.25 but was still down 7.06% over the past seven days.\n\nBitstamp, a Europe-based crypto exchange, revealed Wednesday it will stop providing Ether staking services to U.S. customers from September 25, citing \u201ccurrent regulatory dynamics\u201d in the country. The exchange previously announced it would suspend trades of seven cryptocurrencies declared securities by the U.S. Securitees and Exchange Commission (SEC) from August 27.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher over the past 24 hours. Solana\u2019s SOL token led the winners, jumping 5.35% to US$21.61. But it was still down 5.23% for the week.\n\nSolana Pay, a free-to-use payment protocol built on the Solana blockchain, announced a partnership with Canada-based e-commerce platform Shopify on Wednesday. The partnership will allow Solana Pay users to use USDC stablecoin for online shopping without intermediary fees. The protocol will also consider adding other payment options such as SOL and BOND in the future, TechCrunch reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rebounded 2.53% to US$1.07 trillion. Trading volume rose 10.71% to US$35.37 billion.\n\nNFT market not at rock bottom yet\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.11% over the past 24 hours to 2,271.35 as of 10:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 7.48% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum and Cardano NFT indexes also logged losses, while the Solana and Polygon indexes moved up.\n\nThe Forkast 500 has posted a loss of 44.87% since the start of the year. But the index still has room to fall, Forkast Labs NFT strategist Yehudah Petscher said in a video posted to YouTube Wednesday.\n\n\u201cLast year from the start of the year to the end of the year, the market lost over 75% of its value, meaning we have much further to fall. Possibly a 30% (drop) or more,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nHowever, all is not lost, as rising transactions indicate the potential for industry growth.\n\n\u201cNFTs are dead? Someone\u2019s lying to you,\u201d Petscher tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cTotal sales are similar to early/mid 2021 levels, but the number of buyers/sellers are near 2022 levels. Transactions hit an all-time high too with 3,701,251 last week.\u201d\n\nNFTs are dead? Someone's lying to you.\n\n\n\nHere is the most important NFT chart that nobody's talking about yet.\n\n\n\nPrices are down but traders haven't left at all.\n\n\n\nTotal sales are similar to early/mid 2021 levels, but the number of buyers/sellers are near 2022 levels. Transactions\u2026 pic.twitter.com/firjqSxJiE \u2014 hudah.eth|tez (@Hudah_Idiot) August 23, 2023\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 11.20% in the past 24 hours to US$12.92 million. Volumes on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains dropped, while Solana, Bitcoin and Cardano volumes edged up, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\n\u201cOverall the OpenSea royalty policy is still having an impact on the market. Transactions have been declining, total sales are down and average sales price is up,\u201d said Petscher.\n\n\u201cThe higher average sales price lately indicates expensive NFTs being sold, but these are typically at a loss these days,\u201d he added.\n\nOpenSea, one of the world\u2019s leading NFT marketplaces, announced last week it would stop enforcing royalties \u2014 a major source of income for NFT creators \u2014 from Aug. 31.\n\nIn response to the OpenSea announcement, rival NFT marketplace Rarible said on Wednesday it will continue supporting royalties. It will also stop aggregating orders from the OpenSea, LooksRare and X2Y2 marketplaces, all of which have stopped enforcing royalties.\n\n\u201cDecentralization offers the opportunity to dispel the stigma of the \u2018starving artist,\u2019 and enable the continued growth of projects through true ownership and ongoing earnings,\u201d said Alex Salnikov, co-founder of Rarible, in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe stand in solidarity with creators and artists. That\u2019s why we will no longer support marketplaces that neglect royalties,\u201d he added\n\nAfter the announcement, Rarible experienced a 310.85% surge in 24-hour trading volume to US$34,000 as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. That\u2019s still only a fraction of OpenSea\u2019s 24-hour volume of US$2.19 million \u2014 a 8.82% drop, according to DappRadar data.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it moves the needle one way or another, but now it\u2019s time for collectors and creators to put their money where their mouth is,\u201d said Petscher in Wednesday\u2019s YouTube video.\n\n\u201cIf creators feel strongly that royalties are necessary, they are gonna mint on Rarible, they are gonna partner with Rarible. And the same goes to collectors,\u201d he said.\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) topped the 24-hour sales volume for NFT collections. It fell 50.91%% in the past 24 hours to US$1.34 million. Mythos Chain-based DMarket and Ethereum-based Sorare placed second and third in the ranking.\n\nNvidia gives global equities a boost\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading higher as of 11:40 a.m. in Hong Kong with the tech-heavy Nasdaq posting a 1.30% gain. The three major U.S. indexes closed higher at the end of regular session trading Tuesday.\n\nMain stock indexes across Asia also went higher on Thursday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged gains.\n\nFinancial intelligence corporation S&P Global released its flash U.S. composite PMI index on Wednesday. The index dropped from 52.0 in July to 50.4 in August \u2014 the weakest upturn in economic activities since February 2023.\n\n\u201cA near-stalling of business activity in August raises doubts over the strength of US economic growth in the third quarter,\u201d Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in Wednesday\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cThe survey shows that the service sector-led acceleration of growth in the second quarter has faded, accompanied by a further fall in factory output,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the flash composite PMI index in the euro zone fell from 48.6 in July to 47.0 in August. That\u2019s the lowest reading since November 2020, according to the Hamburg Commercial Bank on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIn reaction to the (PMI) data, government bond yields have fallen sharply across the board, including at the front end due to stronger expectations that the ECB and Fed are now more likely to keep rates unchanged,\u201d Mohamed A. El-Erian, an adviser to Germany-based financial services firm Allianz, tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nWeak PMIs, especially in #Europe, push yields lower and raise expectations of unchanged central bank policy rates:\n\nLed by #Germany, the #Eurozone's PMI fell to 47 (from 48.6) with, services (48.3) contracting for the first time this year while manufacturing (43.7) remained\u2026 \u2014 Mohamed A. El-Erian (@elerianm) August 23, 2023\n\nThe U.S. interest rate is now between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 13.5% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September, down from 15% on Wednesday.\n\nTo receive further insights into the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies, investors await Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. Central bank leaders from across the world will attend the Fed-held annual summit.\n\nElsewhere, U.S. AI chipmaker Nvidia reported second-quarter revenue of US$13.51 billion on Wednesday, an annual jump of over 100%. The firm also forecast revenue of US$16 billion for the three months to the end of October, higher than the analysts\u2019 expectation of US$12.5 billion.\n\nThe share price of Nvidia closed 3.17% higher on Wednesday, and reached an all-time high of over US$517 in extended trading on Thursday morning in Asia.\n\n\u201c(Nvidia\u2019s results show) that betting on AI is paying off today,\u201d Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at financial website Investing.com, told Bloomberg. \u201cThis is a big deal because it validates the narrative that has been propping tech stocks in general this year.\u201d\n\nIn Asia, South Korea\u2019s central bank kept its base rate unchanged at 3.50% on Thursday. The country\u2019s annual inflation rate sits at a two-year low of 2.26%.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin rose and Ether fell during Friday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Solana\u2019s SOL was the day\u2019s biggest loser, failing to capitalize on Thursday\u2019s rally fueled by its partnership announcement with e-commerce firm Shopify on Thursday.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin falls below US$26,000 following Evergrande\u2019s bankruptcy\n\nSOL erases Shopify boost\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token fell 4.69% in the 24 hours to 4:30 in Hong Kong to US$20.67, as the day\u2019s biggest loser in the top 10, giving up most of the gains made Thursday, when Solana announced a partnership with Shopify to offer crypto payments via Solana Pay, a peer-to-peer payments protocol built on the blockchain.\n\nThe XRP token was the day\u2019s second biggest loser in the top 10, falling 3.18% to US$0.5115, which marks a six-week low for the coin, reversing nearly all the progress made since Ripple\u2019s partial victory over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month.\n\nBitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia at US$26,098 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after briefly dipping US$25,966 earlier in the day.\n\nThe world\u2019s first cryptocurrency has been weighed down by numerous factors, including large holders selling during a low-liquidity period, according to Alex Konanykhin, the chief executive officer and founder of Unicoin, an equity-backed crypto that pays dividends.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is inherently volatile. Its price can be driven down by negative news or by a large sale, especially in late summer when liquidity is at its lowest.\u201d\n\nInvestors are also cautiously anticipating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday, which may signal more rate hikes or a negative attitude towards digital assets.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies compete with fiat currencies, so a Fed Chairman may not possibly see Bitcoin as anything but a pesky competitor. Chairman Powell is likely to be negative about Bitcoin but it\u2019s nothing new: many regulators have made negative statements about cryptocurrencies,\u201d wrote Konanykhin in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nStory continues\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 1.62% to US$1.05 trillion while market volume decreased 12.34% to US$28.43 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nForkast 500 sees rare rise\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.41% to 2,279.88 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 6.90% in the past week.\n\nSolana\u2019s non-fungible token (NFT) sales rose 124.43% to US$2.29 million after the new Meegos collection reached over US$1.1 million in sales during the past 24 hours. The Forkast SOL NFT Composite fell 1.23% in the past 24 hours, suggesting that liquidity from established Solana-native collections is flowing into the Meegos collection.\n\ngmaz2xwjXEM7LnSswmJFAnqAXsccdBdRfJHpI25G3eRkY2irRfqW2FfS6UlNsciWKx C760jlxaMfav3hLoMdTscdt1OXMUlKLcqYcQ6nU7KIVMej3v8\n\n\u201cSolana is having a big day of sales, up over 122% and now in the #2 spot on CryptoSlam\u2019s blockchain rankings. A majority of these sales are behind a new PFP collection called Meegos, which was created by Blocksmith Labs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 11.89% to US$8.67 million, but that of the largest Ethereum-based collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, fell 11.33% to US$1.23 million. DeGods sales rose over 309% to US$883,229, making it the third largest NFT collection across all chains by 24-hour sales volume.\n\nAsian equities fall, U.S. stock futures gain ahead of Powell\u2019s speech\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities fell as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong on Friday, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all declining.\n\nBeijing proposed that local governments scrap a rule that disqualifies people with previous mortgages from being considered first-time homebuyers in major cities, in an attempt to halt the slump in the mainland\u2019s residential property market. Yet, the move failed to boost investor sentiment.\n\nInvestors worldwide were cautiously anticipating key speeches by Fed Chair Jerome Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium later today, for signs on future interest rate decisions.\n\nBoth the euro and the British pound hit a new two-month low ahead of today\u2019s speeches.\n\nMajor U.S. stock futures rose for a fourth consecutive day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures all posting gains.\n\nSee related article: Singapore\u2019s Stablecoin framework, Australia\u2019s crypto landscape & Binance shuts \u2018Connect\u2019\n\n(Updates with equities section)"

        "title": "Bitcoin gains traction in West Africa with educational drive - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) adoption in West Africa is dominated by Nigeria, the crypto powerhouse and the region\u2019s economic engine. But against a backdrop of anti-French sentiment, Bitcoin educational efforts are also bubbling away in French-speaking West Africa.\n\nSenegal recently opened its first physical Bitcoin exchange and education center called Bitique, and the country of 17 million people will host another Bitcoin Forum in the capital, Dakar, in December, where pseudonymous local Bitcoin advocate, known as Nourou, runs an independent Bitcoin node beamed from space.\n\nIn Benin, a country of 13 million people to the west of Nigeria, the Bitcoin-only Bitcoin Mastermind conference takes place next month. The first of its kind in the country, Bitcoin Mastermind unites Bitcoin entrepreneurs and crypto enthusiasts from homegrown groups and businesses such as Izichange, GoesPay and Flash, and it offers locals a space to learn about Bitcoin.\n\nCointelegraph spoke with Nourou, the founder of Dakar Bitcoin Days and Bitcoin Senegal, and Lo\u00efc Kassamoto, the founder of Bitcoin Mastermind, to better understand the Bitcoin and West African crypto evolution \u2014 or revolution.\n\nA rising tide lifts all boats\n\nCountries in French-speaking West Africa are subjected to the West African CFA franc currency, described by the Economist as a \u201ccolonial hangover.\u201d The Senegalese are vocal in their criticism of the currency, with some Bitcoin advocates, such as local crypto enthusiast and entrepreneur Mama Bitcoin, explaining that it\u2019s pretty normal to complain about the currency \u2014 an implicit criticism of post-colonial French policy in the region.\n\nAnti-French sentiment has historically existed in the region but has recently manifested in public demonstrations. Neighboring Mali recently dropped French as the nation\u2019s official language \u2014 a law in place since the country won its independence in 1960.\n\nIn Niger, to the east of Mali and north of Nigeria, a recent military coup represented a significant setback for French President Emmanuel Macron and France\u2019s military strategy in the region. Well-known French newspaper Le Monde commented that the coup was a \u201cnew heavy blow\u201d for France\u2019s military strategy in Niger\u2019s Sahel region.\n\nA groundswell of alternative currency initiatives is occurring across French-speaking West Africa. Growing numbers of Senegalese are turning to Bitcoin as a savings tool and a means of exchange, while in Benin, Bitcoin Mastermind\u2019s Kassamoto told Cointelegraph the number of Beninois turning to Bitcoin is also on the up.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?\n\nIn the West, much financial discussion and education tends to take place online. However, the emphasis in West African countries is on physical meetups and real-life interaction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Nourou said that discussions about Bitcoin and money were transferred and confined to online platforms such as ClubHouse and X (formerly Twitter), but more and more physical spaces have opened up post-pandemic.\n\nNourou opens Bitique in the Dakar business district. Source: Nourou\n\nIndeed, as Kassamoto explains, one of the keys to unlocking deeper levels of financial education and demonstrating how West Africans could use a decentralized currency such as Bitcoin is through interactions in the real world:\n\n\u201cBitcoin conferences, meetups and shops provide opportunities for education, outreach and direct interaction. Conferences and meetups bring the community together, share knowledge and exchange experiences.\u201d\n\nNorou opened Bitique, which is Dakar\u2019s first physical Bitcoin store for buying and selling cryptocurrency. He explained that in addition to trading services, there will also be educational programs for people to learn about Bitcoin in person: \u201cTraining courses will be around 10,000 francs [$16] for two or even three hours of training.\u201d\n\nThe in-person training goes hand in hand with a series of classroom sessions that Bitcoin Senegal conducts nationwide called the \u201cBaol Digital Kids\u201d program, which teaches kids how to use Bitcoin and the Lightning Network.\n\n@SeckIdrissa, un membre actif de notre communaut\u00e9, vient d'animer une session de sensibilisation sur la th\u00e9matique Bitcoin/cryptomonnaies \u00e0 de jeunes enfants, lors du \"Baol Digital Kids\" organis\u00e9 par @xaralatech.\n\nUne initiative \u00e0 encourager et \u00e0 soutenir pic.twitter.com/aX4u9kVFoz \u2014 \u20bfitcoin S\u00e9n\u00e9gal (@bitcoin_sen) August 11, 2023\n\nThe kids in the video who received and sent their first satoshis via the layer-2 Lightning Network can spend the money at a growing number of merchants listed on the open-source Bitcoin tool BTCmap.org. In just 18 months, Dakar has developed from one small Bitcoin office to tens of artisans, restaurants and caf\u00e9s accepting the cryptocurrency.\n\nNourou recently received a Blockstream Satellite kit, which, once set up, will allow him to run a Bitcoin node that will be protected against network interruptions. The internet service can sometimes be patchy and unreliable in West Africa. According to Blockstream, the satellite kit ensures that any connected Bitcoin full node \u201cwill not be isolated or partitioned,\u201d with blocks streaming continuously for the node to verify.\n\nAcross a few borders in Benin, Kassamoto, along with his peers, runs what he believes to be one of Benin\u2019s first Bitcoin nodes.\n\n8GB of Ram and using the Ubuntu process from Umbrel and bim we became probably one of the first to run a Bitcoin node in Benin\n\n\n\nWe'll share more experience about this soon. \u2014 Lo\u00efc Kassamoto (@Loicbtc) January 24, 2023\n\nHe explains that Bitcoin adoption has increased, but it comes with risks due to its association with crypto:\n\n\u201cBitcoin adoption in West Africa is greatly helped and hindered by cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nKassamoto said that the money-making side of crypto attracts more and more people into the \u201ccrypto universe,\u201d but crypto scams, loss and rug pulls taint Bitcoin\u2019s appeal. The promise of crypto riches drawing noobies into Bitcoin is not necessarily good.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s toxic for Bitcoin because these people are very quickly disappointed with their loss and associate it with Bitcoin because they haven\u2019t even had time to understand the difference between the two,\u201d he said.\n\nKassamoto said that \u201cBitcoin, not crypto,\u201d is what the West African community should understand.\n\nThere are more Bitcoin meetups and, therefore, more opportunities to demonstrate what many Bitcoin exchanges and thought leaders have preached for some time: that there could be a difference between Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market.\n\nRelated: Worldcoin cryptocurrency project suspended in Kenya\n\nThe Central African Republic, which made headlines in 2022 for adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, was elevated and then dropped by large swathes of the Bitcoin community. After adopting Bitcoin, it announced its own crypto token, Sango Coin, while the country is now experimenting with tokenizing real-world assets such as farmland.\n\nIn Ghana, to the east of Benin, another large Bitcoin and educational conference will occur this year. Strike CEO Jack Mallers and Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein will speak as part of a Bitcoin educational drive in West Africa.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

Named nCOP, the token is overcollateralized by reserve assets and allows people and businesses to transfer, pay, earn and save money using blockchain rails, the press release said. The new offering arrives as stablecoins, a roughly $124 billion subset of digital assets, are increasingly in demand in emerging regions with frail financial systems such as Latin America and Turkey. People also use these cryptocurrencies to send remittances and store value, according to a report by crypto research firm Chainalysis. \"Currently, Colombia is one of the main recipients of remittances in Latin America, with nearly USD 10 billion flowing into the country,\" Agust\u00edn Liserra, CEO of Num Finance, said in a statement. \"Num Finance aims to provide a new possibility for people to send and receive nCOP as remittances and receive a yield on it.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether rose during Thursday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The SOL token saw the biggest gain in the top 10, following its new partnership with e-commerce giant Shopify.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin falls below US$26,000 following Evergrande\u2019s bankruptcy\n\nSOL leads winners as Bitcoin, Ether rise with most top 10 cryptos\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token rose 4.33% in the 24 hours to 4:30 in Hong Kong to US$20.79, as the day\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 10, after Solana announced partnering Shopify to offer crypto payments with no transaction fees on the e-commerce platform via Solana Pay, a peer-to-peer payments protocol built on the blockchain. Despite the good news, SOL remained near a six-week low.\n\n1xXOwDNYmLP2JEUlCHo5VVb3VZmh22uzK3R4jdRdglCkfh7MsIJ Umq sg qbr8WhQbM3ZSJU18REtsTFAUEITJ2UCVDwe378UujyTOBqSdnR04J966JFMQPiNpuLdeXg7jX 6XvFqriZBgZosXFPk\n\nBitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, changing hands at US$26,430 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after it briefly rose to the US$26,769 mark earlier today.\n\nDespite today\u2019s small rally, Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, said that returning to US$25,000 remained a possibility.\n\n\u201cUS$25,000 is the level where BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF. There is support at that level. Investors will be spooked if Bitcoin falls below that level. After that level, Bitcoin could fall to approximately US$19,870, which represents the level where Silicon Valley Bank failed,\u201d wrote Kiely, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\n\u201cWhen SVB failed, Bitcoin rocketed to US$31,000 before moving sideways. BlackRock and other firms then made their Bitcoin ETF announcements, and Bitcoin ripped again.\u201d\n\nEther rose 0.59% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,671 bringing its weekly losses to 6.92%.\n\nTron\u2019s (TRX) token rose 1.73% in the past 24 hours to US$0.077, bouncing back from a two-month low of US$0.073 on June 25.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 1.45% to US$1.07 trillion while market volume decreased 8.66% to US$32.44 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpenSea\u2019s decision continues to weigh on NFT market\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.12% to 2,272.28 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and 7.43% in the past week.\n\n\u201cOverall the OpenSea royalty policy is still having an impact on the market. Transactions have been declining, total sales are down and average sales price is up,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, referring to OpenSea\u2019s decision to cut creator royalty fees.\n\n\u201cThe higher average sales price lately indicates expensive NFTs being sold, but these are typically at a loss these days.\u201d\n\nBored Ape #8585 was sold for US$255,000 on Sunday, at a loss of over US$777,000 compared to its purchasing price of US$1.03 million a year ago.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales rose 1.63% to US$8.51 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-based collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 3.89% to US$1.64 million. Sorare sales also rose 17.3% to US$537,421, making it the third largest NFT collection across all chains by 24-hour sales volume. CryptoPunks sales also increased 25.51%.\n\nDraftKings, a Polygon-based NFT project, fell to become the seventh-largest collection across all chains after its 24-hour sales volume fell 25.97%. Polygon\u2019s 24-hour sales also declined 17.66%, while the Forkast POL NFT Composite was nearly flat for the day.\n\nInterest in Ordinals inscriptions also remained low, as 24-hour NFT sales on the Bitcoin network fell 12.04%.\n\nNvidia earnings boost U.S. stock futures, Asian equities\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities rose as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong on Thursday, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all posting gains.\n\nInvestors were optimistic after Chinese President Xi Jinping indicated in written remarks that the fundamentals of the Chinese economy remained strong despite minor headwinds at home and abroad.\n\nMost Major U.S. stock futures also rose for a third consecutive day, except the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures. The S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures both posted gains.\n\nNasdaq\u2019s gains received a boost from Nvidia share prices that gained over 3% after the chipmaker\u2019s earnings report showed that its data center revenue rising 171% year over year to US$10.32 billion.\n\nNvidia\u2019s earnings report also provided fuel for European equity markets, with Frankfurt\u2019s DAX 40 gaining 1% and the pan-European STOXX 600 inching up 0.9% on Thursday.\n\nOn the corporate front, investors are anticipating earnings reports from Intuit, the Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto Dominion Bank, NetEase and Marvell Technology, scheduled for later today.\n\nInvestors are also looking ahead to key speeches by U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday where central bank leaders will converge.\n\nSee related article: Singapore\u2019s Stablecoin framework, Australia\u2019s crypto landscape & Binance shuts \u2018Connect\u2019\n\nUpdates with equities"

        "title": "Bitcoin back down to US$26,000 as investors await US Fed chair speech - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin dropped to around the US$26,000 level Friday morning in Asia, giving up much of the previous day\u2019s gains. Ahead of the U.S Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s Friday speech at Jackson Hole, investors are looking for signs of an end to the rate hike cycle, with repercussions for the crypto market. Ether moved lower to near the US$1,600 support level, while most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged losses. Solana led the losers after its own day of gains Thursday. The Forkast 500 NFT index gained slightly as the Solana blockchain\u2019s new partnership with e-commerce platform Shopify points to better times ahead for NFTs. U.S. stock futures traded mixed after Wall Street closed lower on Thursday, with all three major U.S. indexes logging losses of over 1%.\n\nBitcoin gives up gains as cautionary mood prevails\n\nBitcoin dropped 1.40% in the last 24 hours to US$26,081.21 as of 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong and traded 2.90% lower for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached a low of US$25,914.93 on early Friday, a 2.9% decline from its high daily high of US$26,688.48 on Thursday.\n\nAccording to Samer Hasn, market analyst at Australia-based global multi-asset broker XS.com, the current caution in the crypto market is due to increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has brought lawsuits against a number of digital asset firms, including Ripple Labs, Binance.US and Coinbase. Luxembourg-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp said Thursday it will stop Ether staking services for U.S. customers from Sep. 25 in light of recent regulatory developments.\n\nHasn said the \u201cnegative sentiment may continue to put pressure on the cryptocurrency market in the coming weeks or months until a regulatory and legislative environment that regulates the cryptocurrency market becomes clear.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to data from blockchain intelligence firm Santiment that shows Bitcoin whales moving large amounts of the token to their wallets as a further sign of a decline in market sentiment.\n\n\u201cThe relatively huge movements in cryptocurrency wallets, led by Bitcoin, may continue to weaken the confidence of participants and fuel a state of caution about what may happen in the future in the market and lead to collapses or wide fluctuations,\u201d Hasn added.\n\nGreta Yuan, head of research at Hong Kong-based digital asset exchange VDX, said that investors have to recognize that \u201cthe bear market is not over yet.\u201d With trading volume across the market still weak, Bitcoin\u2019s price could remain in the range of US$25,000-27,000 for some time, she added.\n\nAlongside Bitcoin\u2019s losses, Ether also dipped 1.40% to US$1,652.77 and was down 3.27% over the past seven days.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower over the past 24 hours. The exception was Binance\u2019s BNB token, which edged up 0.58% to US$217.48 but still logged a weekly loss of 1.87%.\n\nMastercard said it will end four crypto card programs in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Bahrain by September 22. The global payment giant was partnered with Binance on the four programs. No reason was provided for the cancellations, first reported by Reuters on Thursday.\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL token led the losers, falling 3.09% to US$20.90 for a weekly loss of 4.98%.\n\nSOL reached a four-day high of US$21.99 on Thursday as it announced that Solana Pay \u2014 a free-to-use payment protocol built on the Solana blockchain \u2014 has partnered with Canada-based e-commerce platform Shopify to allow USDC stablecoin payments for online shopping without intermediary fees.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.23% to US$1.05 trillion. Trading volume fell 22.52% to US$27.41 billion.\n\nSigns of life for NFTs?\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.20% over the past 24 hours to 2,274.13 as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still down 7.36% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum and Cardano NFT indexes dropped, while the Solana and Polygon indexes moved up.\n\n\u201cGlobal sales are up to over US$15m in the past 24 hours and the Forkast 500 has been flashing green over this period. I wouldn\u2019t expect this to last though,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, via a note.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 24.48% in the past 24 hours to US$15.20 million. Volumes on the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon and Cardano blockchains all logged increases, while the Bitcoin network\u2019s volume dropped, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nSolana spearheaded the increase in NFT trading volumes, surging over 125% in the past 24 hours to US$2.24 million and second place in CryptoSlam\u2019s volumes ranking.\n\n\u201cA majority of these sales are behind a new profile-picture (PFP) collection called Meegos that was created by Blocksmith Labs. In just a few hours the collection has 10x the sales as the second ranked Solana collection, totaling over US$1 million in sales today,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana\u2019s recently-announced partnership with e-commerce platform Shopify has provided a much-needed boost to the NFT market.\n\n\u201cMost NFTs you have to pay for with crypto, and we need crypto adoption,\u201d Petscher said in a video posted to YouTube Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is just an inevitable step to bring people into Web3, like what we\u2019re seeing with Paypal and their introduction of a stablecoin, so mass adoption is happening,\u201d he added.\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) continued to top the 24-hour sales volume for NFT collections. It rose 6.64% in the past 24 hours to US$1.28 million. Solana-based Meegos and Mythos Chain-based DMarket placed second and third in the ranking.\n\nMeanwhile, art NFTs \u2014 especially generative art \u2014 remain a big seller, despite the bear market.\n\nMomentum, a generative art collection by Dutch artist Rik Oostenbroek, was released on Thursday as part of Velocity \u2014 an NFT series launched by crypto exchange Bybit and Formula One racing team Oracle Red Bull Racing. It sold out within the day.\n\nElsewhere, Eric Calderon, founder of generative art platform Art Blocks, released his \u201cheart + craft\u201d NFT collection on the Arbitrum blockchain on Friday. Each of the NFTs in the collection contain a generative art piece and a 3D printable model that can be used to generate physical replicas of the artwork.\n\nPowell speech to shed light on Fed policy\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell|Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading mixed as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong. Wall Street closed lower at the end of regular session trading Thursday. All three major U.S. indexes fell more than 1% as the Nvidia-led tech rally subsided.\n\nMain stock indexes across Asia also dipped on Friday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged losses\n\nAll eyes are now on the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday, which will be attended by central bank leaders from across the world. The speech will provide further insights into the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\nThe Fed raised its interest rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% in July, the highest level in 22 years. Powell said following July\u2019s meeting that the central bank will take a \u201cdata-dependent\u201d approach when deciding how to reduce the country\u2019s annual inflation below its long-term goal of 2%.\n\n\u201cFading expectations of recession have brought the focus back to inflation and a potential tight Fed,\u201d analysts at Bank of America said in note viewed by Reuters.\n\n\u201cRisk assets have started showing more signs of weakness than at any other point this year,\u201d they added. \u201cWe therefore think equities are more at risk of a macro-driven shock than the market is pricing in.\u201d\n\nAhead of Powell\u2019s speech, Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins told Yahoo! Finance on Thursday that the Fed might need to raise the interest rate further and keep it elevated for longer.\n\n\u201cI think it is going to take some time to really be sure we are seeing sustained realignment of demand and supply that is needed in order to bring inflation back on a path that will get back to 2%,\u201d said Collins.\n\nMeanwhile, Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker told CNBC on Thursday he thought the Fed should keep the interest rate as it is \u201cfor a while.\u201d The economy could see rate cuts in 2024 depending on the data, he added.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 19.5% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September, up from 13.5% on Thursday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "The future of BTC mining and the Bitcoin halving - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "On the latest episode of Cointelegraph\u2019s Market Talks, host Ray Salmond spoke with Dan Rosen, associate director of derivatives at Luxor, a United States-based Bitcoin (BTC) mining pool, research hub and service provider.\n\nThe show touched on a number of broad topics, including Rosen\u2019s view on how the upcoming Bitcoin halving will impact BTC price, why Bitcoin\u2019s volatility is set to remain in the double-digits for years to come, and miners\u2019 ability to hedge their operations via hash rate derivatives.\n\nAccording to Rosen:\n\n\u201cAny maturing asset goes through experiences of high volatility when it first launches, and if you compare Bitcoin to the tech stocks of the early 90s, like Apple and Google, their volatility was astronomical. Bitcoin has also touched crazy high levels of volatility in the 70% to 100% [range] four years ago. This is dropping over time, but we will continue to see this trend as the asset becomes more investable and the eventual launch of an ETF [exchange-traded fund]. One day, we are likely to see a 20% or sub-20% annualized asset class, in maybe four or five years.\u201d\n\nHistorically, outside of pledging mined Bitcoin rewards, miners have had few options for hedging risk within their operations. Luxor\u2019s hash rate derivatives essentially add infrastructure to this area of the industry by allowing miners to hedge their exposure to changes in hashprice. The derivatives give miners the option to predict and lock in future revenue during events of unexpected volatility that impact the efficiency of their operations.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin difficulty jumps 6% to new peak as miners ignore BTC price dip\n\nMacro continues to impact Bitcoin\u2019s price and miners\n\nRegarding the macro and how this could impact Bitcoin\u2019s price and its miners, Rosen said, \u201cThe market is starting to realize that we\u2019re probably not going to get to that 2% inflation target rate any time soon, and it does appear that the market is starting to price in that inflation longer-term will hover around the 2.5% to 3% range. At the same time, we\u2019re still seeing the U.S. dollar as a flight-to-safety asset, and this is impacting equities and creating macro headwinds at the same time, leading to a depreciated value of dollar-denominated assets.\u201d\n\nDespite this dismal economic outlook, Rosen believes:\n\n\u201cWhile Bitcoin price might not hit six figures leading into the halving or directly after it, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see new lows over the next six months due to macro headwinds and then a stronger rally afterward.\u201d\n\nListen to the full episode of Market Talks on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel, and don\u2019t forget to click \u201cLike\u201d and \u201cSubscribe\u201d to keep up-to-date with all our latest content."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell 1.45% from Aug. 18 to Aug. 25 to US$26,095 as of 8:00 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading below US$30,000 since Aug. 9. Ether, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, fell 1.84% over the week to US$1,654.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bitcoin dropped to US$25,628, its lowest point in two months.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has been weighed down by numerous factors, including large holders selling during a low-liquidity period, according to Alex Konanykhin, the chief executive officer and founder of Unicoin, an equity-backed crypto that pays dividends.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is inherently volatile. Its price can be driven down by negative news or by a large sale, especially in late summer when liquidity is at its lowest.\u201d\n\nCoinbase Global, the company behind the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., announced Monday that it acquired an equity stake in Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. While the size of the equity stake is unknown, Coinbase noted that it will share the revenue from interest on USDC reserves with Circle, based on the amount of stablecoins held on the two platforms.\n\nThe Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which is a multifactorial measure of crypto market sentiment, sank to 37 on Wednesday, its lowest point since March 12 when the index plunged to 32 just two days after the third-largest bank failure in the U.S., the collapse of crypto-friendly Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will be speaking at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium later today, along with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. Investors will be following the speech for signs on future interest rate decisions.\n\n\u201cParsing the July Fed minutes, it is clear that policymakers are grappling with the decision to implement further rate hikes as they acknowledge the threat of resurgent inflation,\u201d cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex said in its research report. \u201cAll eyes are now on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s upcoming Jackson Hole speech on the economic outlook.\u201d\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.05 trillion on Friday at 8:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 10.25% from US$1.17 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$508 billion, Bitcoin represented 48.4% of the market while Ether, valued at US$198 billion, accounted for 18.9%.\n\nNotable Movers: BONE & SUI\n\nBone, the governance and reward token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, was this week\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 100, rising 15.71% to US$1.44. Pseudonymous Shiba Inu developer, Shytoshi Kusama, shared a \u201cShibarium scaling\u201d update on Wednesday. Shibarium, an Ethereum layer-2 chain for Shiba Inu, is currently preparing for a reopening after botching its launch earlier this month.\n\nSui blockchain\u2019s native coin (SUI) was this week\u2019s second biggest gainer in the top 100, rising 14.22% to US$0.5472.\n\nNext Week: Will Bitcoin fall to US$25,000?\n\nBitcoin could retrace to the US$25,000 support level next week, but that could set the stage for the next price rally, according to Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App.\n\n\u201cAt this point, US$25,000 serves as the next support level, and after that US$20,000. If Bitcoin drops below US$20,000, it could revisit this cycle\u2019s low of US$15,700, especially if the stock market drops to its October 2020 lows. If the stock market stays firm, Bitcoin will likely stay around the current levels,\u201d wrote Kiely, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nUnicoin\u2019s Konanykhin said he expects Bitcoin and Ether to close the month of August near their current levels of US$26,000 and US$1,650.\n\nNext week, investors will be looking ahead to the release of the U.S. jobs report on Friday, which includes economic indicators such as nonfarm payrolls typically used by economists to gauge the Fed\u2019s next monetary policy decision.\n\nIn the crypto space, U.S.-based crypto exchange Bitstamp will halt trading for SOL, SAND, NEAR, MATIC, MANA, CHZ and AXS, starting next Thursday, to evaluate \u201crecent market developments.\u201d The exchange said that customers in the U.S. will still be able to hold and withdraw these assets.\n\nSee related article: Hackers hit Curve, China announces blockchain link & is FTX back?"

        "title": "Robinhood accumulates $3B of Bitcoin in 3 months \u2014 What does this mean for markets? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In a swift and intriguing turn of events, a previously enigmatic Bitcoin (BTC) address managed to catapult itself to the esteemed position of the third-largest holder of BTC. As reported by Cointelegraph on Aug. 22, the address in question accumulated a staggering 118,000 BTC.\n\nWhile its identity has now been attributed to Robinhood, questions still linger, as the financial giant has neither confirmed nor denied that it owns the address. Some on-chain analysts posit that the stash actually belongs to MicroStrategy, the U.S. business intelligence and analytics software firm, which holds 152,800 BTC, as per their recent submission to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIs TradFi dethroning crypto-focused intermediaries?\n\nShould Robinhood\u2019s ownership of the 118,000 BTC be validated, the consequences could reverberate across the cryptocurrency landscape. Traditionally, the largest Bitcoin addresses have predominantly been linked to crypto-native exchanges. However, Robinhood\u2019s role as a conventional broker focused on equities and options sets an intriguing precedent.\n\nA glance at Robinhood\u2019s latest 10-Q filing reveals that they held $4.24 billion in Bitcoin. Given Bitcoin\u2019s price neared $30,500 on June 30, this equates to approximately 139,016 BTC \u2014 a fact that aligns seamlessly with the on-chain analysts\u2019 contentions regarding Robinhood\u2019s substantial crypto holdings.\n\nIf Robinhood is the owner of the \u201cmystery\u201d Bitcoin address, this makes one point pretty clear. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t rely on big institutions to succeed. Analysts used to argue that for Bitcoin to really take off, more big investment firms or companies like Tesla and Block needed to get on board. But those hopes fizzled out as recent reports from Apple and Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) revealed they hadn\u2019t taken the Bitcoin plunge after all.\n\nRegarding Robinhood, reports say that by June 2023, they had around 23.2 million active users. If just 10% owned some Bitcoin, they would need an average of about $1,828 each to reach the reported $4.24 billion in Bitcoin holdings. This shows that regular people, like those on Robinhood, can play a significant role in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nThe downside of Bitcoin being held by Robinhood\n\nWhile some investors want Bitcoin mass adoption by any means possible, getting there is not without risk. Robinhood\u2019s user base is known for its penchant for speculative trading, notably in meme stocks like AMC, GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond. These traders also boast substantial holdings in Dogecoin (DOGE) \u2014 amounting to a staggering $2.63 billion.\n\nTheir propensity for short-term investments raises questions about their approach to Bitcoin. If these investors purchased BTC in anticipation of U.S. spot-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, the prospect of a prolonged price decline or delayed approval might trigger mass sell-offs.\n\nFurthermore, a more remote yet conceivable risk emerges from the possibility of U.S. government intervention. Although the probability of a scenario akin to the 1933 Executive Order 6102, which mandated private gold holdings be exchanged for paper currency, seems slim, potential actions by U.S. authorities could potentially jeopardize these holdings.\n\nEven in the unlikely scenario where the U.S. justice system or the Internal Revenue Service opts to lock down those assets while investigating users for tax or similar issues, the substantial stash of Bitcoin held by Robinhood only amplifies the potential risks. Robinhood\u2019s expansive pool of assets heightens the risk of such actions affecting a larger portion of the market.\n\nRelated: ARK, Glassnode propose Bitcoin economic analytics framework using new metric\n\nParadoxically, this vast accumulation of cryptocurrency holdings by Robinhood clients could potentially serve as ammunition for ETF applicants. While offering a comparable service, Robinhood\u2019s potential lack of investor protections could incentivize the establishment of more secure and regulated ETFs.\n\nThe newfound prominence of Robinhood in the cryptocurrency sphere underscores the ever-evolving nature of the market. Whether or not spot Bitcoin ETFs materialize, investors will find alternative avenues to enhance their exposure to cryptocurrency, be it through MicroStrategy shares, Robinhood or other innovative means. This adaptability aptly demonstrates that in the realm of finance, innovation and progress are inevitable, much like nature\u2019s unyielding drive to find a way.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "These 3 Buy-Rated Bitcoin Mining Companies Are Poise To Run! - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Is the cryptocurrency market back? That\u2019s one of the most common questions we hear on the web, as Coinbase was recently approved to offer cryptocurrency futures trading to retail investors in the United States by the National Futures Association (NFA). This is a big win for crypto enthusiasts, as Coinbase previously only offered the derivatives to institutional investors. Some say this has opened the floodgates to potential buyers and sellers of BTC and ETH futures, increasing the currency's adoption in the financial market. How does this regulatory approval affect the market as a whole?\n\nAccording to industry expert Denis Sklyarov, co-founder and CEO of WiFi Map, \u201cThe approval granted to Coinbase for listing regulated and leveraged crypto futures in the US is a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency industry. It demonstrates digital assets' growing acceptance and integration into traditional financial markets\u201d.\n\nIf you are uncomfortable buying the currency derivatives themselves, you may check out companies that mine them as a potential proxy for the currencies\u2019 possible performance. Here are three buy-rated Bitcoin mining companies we think you should watch.\n\nCleanSpark Inc. (\n\nCLSK\n\n)\n\nCleanSpark, Inc. is an industrial-scale Bitcoin mining and infrastructure company. Its subsidiaries, CleanBlok, Inc. and ATL Data Centers LLC, operate the company\u2019s Bitcoin mining operations. CLSK also owns and maintains actual property holdings through its other subsidiaries, CSRE Property Management Company, CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, LLC, and CSRE Properties, LLC; it maintains real property holdings for ATL Data Centers LLC and CleanBlok Inc. The company also owns Mawson Infrastructure Group Inc., which provides a Bitcoin mining facility with an output of nearly 560 petahashes per second (PH/s)in Sandersville, Georgia.\n\nCleanSpark recently announced that its acquisitions of new facilities will be going live to further assist in mining operations. These acquisitions are predicted to provide substantial output efficiency in its operations.\n\nAnalyst Rating\n\nAnalysts have high expectations for CLSK, as everyone covering the company issued it a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d recommendation. The mean target price for CLSK is $11.25, with a high target of $14.00, an upside potential of almost 3x.\n\nCipher Mining (\n\nCIFR\n\n)\n\nCipher Mining Inc. is a technology company that operates and develops bitcoin mining data centers on an industrial scale. Cipher Mining\u2019s operations include four Bitcoin mining data centers in Texas. Its Odessa, Texas facility has a production capacity of approximately 4.2 exahash per second (EH/s). Its chief data center (the \u201cChief\u201d facility) in Andrews, Texas, is a 10 MW center directly connected to the electrical grid. CIFR also operates another data center in Andrews (\u201cBear\u201d) and one more in Happy, Texas (\u201cAlborz\u201d).\n\nThe company\u2019s plans for a 30MW expansion at its Bear and Chief site will put it in good standing in reaching its target of 8.7 EH/s, just in time for 2024\u2019s Bitcoin halving event.\n\nAnalyst Rating\n\nAnalysts rate CIFR as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d based on 4 Strong Buy and 1 Buy recommendation. The mean target price for CIFR is set to $5.10, with a high target price of $6.00, a potential upside of 104%.\n\nRiot Platforms, Inc. (\n\nRIOT\n\n)\n\nRiot Platforms, Inc. is a Bitcoin mining company supporting the expansion of the evergrowing Bitcoin community\u2019s blockchain. Riot offers services focused on enhancing its Bitcoin mining capabilities and customers' ability to mine Bitcoin at an institutional scale. This is done using the critical and comprehensive mining infrastructure in its 700-megawatt Rockdale facility.\n\nRIOT operates in three main segments:\n\nBitcoin Mining\n\nEngineering\n\nData Center Hosting\n\nRIOT currently owns approximately 88,500 miners, which has a capacity of 9.7 exahash per second (EH/s). The company also designs custom-engineered electrical products and manufactures power distribution equipment as part of its engineering segment.\n\nAnalyst Rating\n\nRIOT is still one of the top recommendations of analysts in its sector. Experts have high hopes for RIOT with a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating from 6 Strong buys,1 Buy, and 1 Hold recommendation. The mean target for RIOT is $18.61, and the high target price is $24.00, with an upside potential of 132%.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile some may argue that the cryptocurrency market is still in its early stages, we can\u2019t deny that some investors are bullish on their technological outlook. The increasing adoption and application of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technologies are slowly building a foundation for continued progress. These and their inclusion in the financial markets have added another win for pro-crypto investors.\n\nMore Stock Market News from Barchart\n\nApple Stock: Buy the 10% Dip Because the Future Looks Bright Stocks Tumble on a Sell-Off in Mega-Cap Tech Stocks 3 Energy Stocks to Add to Your Dividend Portfolio 5 Proven Ways to Cut Travel Costs in RetirementOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is \u201cmuch more likely\u201d to stay rangebound until at least Q4, 2023, according to longtime market participant Filbfilb.\n\nIn an X thread on Aug. 25, the popular analyst and co-founder of trading suite Decentrader told readers to expect flat BTC price action into year end.\n\nFilbfilb: BTC price approaching \"critical time\"\n\nBitcoin may be disappointing bulls after its 70% Q1 gains, but for Filbfilb, there is little about BTC price action this halving cycle that is different to its previous ones.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is 1200 days since the previous halving. During this period, Bitcoin has historically consolidated,\u201d he explained.\n\nUploading various comparative charts, Filbfilb predicted that miners should begin to bid price higher into the Bitcoin halving \u2014 with this occurring around 1,276 days after each prior halving.\n\n\u201cMiners are incentivized to ensure that prices are well above marginal cost prior to the halving. Whether they collude consciously, or not they are collectively incentivized to send prices higher before their marginal revenue is effectively halved,\u201d he wrote, also adding that smart money interested in \u201cbuying the rumor\u201d around the halving\u2019s potential positive BTC price impact had also buoyed the market in previous years.\n\nUnder this scenario, 1,276 from the 2020 halving gives early November as a potential deadline for such behavior to show itself.\n\n\u201cFrom a timing perspective Q4 seems like a critical time for BTC where we are likely to see supply constricted and new money driven by speculation,\u201d Filbfilb forecast.\n\n\u201cUntil then, it would be unusual for Bitcoin to break up, much more likely to consolidate.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Filbfilb/X\n\nMacro risk to Bitcoin stays \"elephant in the room\"\n\nBetween now and then, however, various curve balls may lie in wait for Bitcoin, not least of which is United States macroeconomic policy.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin could be worth less than $20K in 2023, US inflation data says\n\nThe September meeting of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee, which will decide benchmark interest rates, is of particular interest to risk asset bulls.\n\nFilbfilb described the macro aspect as being \u201cclearly the elephant in the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that can remain steady, then I believe the game theory will play out and Bitcoin will convincingly break $30k before the 2023 year-end,\u201d he wrote.\n\nShould a more bearish scenario enter and Bitcoin return to $20,000, the current 2023 local high of $31,800 may remain in force.\n\n\u201cI would suggest that if that happens and is for anything other than for a very short time period, then the pre-halving pump may only take us to the 2023 highs already seen and breaking it would come later,\u201d he concluded.\n\nPotential BTC/USD scenarios. Source: Filbfilb/X\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, other analysts are also counting the days between halvings, with varying BTC price predictions coming as a result.\n\nAsset manager Pantera Capital this week delivered a $35,000 target for the next halving and $148,000 for after the 2024 event, while another recent prediction stated that $100,000 would under no circumstances come before it.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is due to hit nearly $150,000 during its next four-year halving cycle, Pantera Capital believes.\n\nIn its latest \u201cBlockchain Letter,\u201d released on Aug. 22, executives at the crypto asset manager doubled down on their bullish BTC price forecasts for 2024 and beyond.\n\nHalving data reinforces November 2022 BTC price bottom\n\nBitcoin price performance depends heavily on its halving cycles, Pantera Capital argues, and with the next due within the coming twelve months, the firm is betting that historical trends will continue.\n\nBTC/USD, it notes, tends to put in a cycle bottom and top roughly equal lengths of time from each block subsidy halving, which cuts the number of Bitcoin paid to miners per block by 50%.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has historically bottomed 477 days prior to the halving, climbed leading into it, and then exploded to the upside afterward,\u201d it wrote.\n\n\u201cThe post-halving rallies have averaged 480 days \u2013 from the halving to the peak of that next bull cycle.\u201d\n\nThat same theory suggests that the 2022 bear market bottom marked the current BTC price cycle bottom.\n\n\u201cIF history were to repeat itself, the price of bitcoin should have troughed December 30, 2022,\u201d Pantera continued.\n\nLooking forward, by the halving date in April 2024, BTC/USD could be trading at around $35,000 \u2014 something that it is still on track to accomplish.\n\nHowever, what happens in the 480 days afterward involves not only a new all-time high but much more.\n\n\u201cThe 2016 halving decreased the supply of new bitcoins only one-third as much as the first. Interestingly, it had exactly one-third the price impact. The 2020 halving reduced the supply of new bitcoins by 43% relative to the previous halving. It had a 23% as big an impact on price,\u201d Pantera stated.\n\n\u201cThe next halving is expected to occur on April 20, 2024. Since most bitcoins are now in circulation, each halving will be almost exactly half as big a reduction in new supply. If history were to repeat itself, the next halving would see bitcoin rising to $35k before the halving and $148k after.\u201d\n\n480 days from an April 2024 halving makes Bitcoin scheduled to hit its next all-time high by July 2025.\n\nBitcoin halving characteristics (screenshot).

Joe Kelly, the cofounder and CEO of financial services company Unchained, also sees steep upside for bitcoin after the halving process. He pointed out in a recent note that 12 months after the 2012, 2016, and 2020 halvings, bitcoin was up 8,069%, 284%, and 559%, respectively.\n\n\"Taking a conservative view,\" Kelly wrote, \"if bitcoin stays around $30K until the halving, even a 12-month post-halving increase of 250% \u2014 which, again, is conservative relative to previous halvings \u2014 would price bitcoin at $105K.\""

No reason was provided for the decision, though the cryptocurrency exchange went on to say that less than 1% of its users in the regions would be affected.

        "title": "Bitcoin options data points to an interesting outcome after this week's $1.9B expiry - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The upcoming $1.9 billion Bitcoin monthly options expiry on Aug. 25 is key to defining whether the $26,000 support level will hold. One could pin the recent cryptocurrency market sell-off on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delaying its decision on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, but there\u2019s also the macroeconomic perspective.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to curb inflation work, it\u2019s probable that the trend of a stronger U.S. dollar will persist. This was evident as the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), a measure of the dollar against other currencies, reached its highest level in 76 days on Aug. 22.\n\nTo prevent a potential loss of $380 million due to the monthly Bitcoin (BTC) options expiry, Bitcoin bulls must ensure Bitcoin's price trades above $27,000 by Aug. 25.\n\nBitcoin bears will benefit from the threat of harsh regulation\n\nCryptocurrency bulls have encountered regulatory challenges lately. This is evident as the top two cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, are currently entangled in lawsuits with the SEC. Additionally, the initial victory celebrated by Ripple against the SEC is now under appeal by the regulatory body.\n\nAdding to these developments, Bitstamp recently revealed its decision to halt staking services for U.S.-based clients. A pivotal concern within the ongoing U.S. regulatory landscape revolves around the classification of Ether (ETH) as either a commodity or a security.\n\nFurthermore, Binance has communicated the suspension of its crypto debit card offerings across Latin America and the Middle East. This decision follows allegations of Binance also suspending euro withdrawals and deposits through SEPA on Aug. 20. The exchange clarified that there is no definite timeline for reinstating the service.\n\nData shows bulls were excessively optimistic about Bitcoin price\n\nThe open interest for the options expiry on Aug. 25 stands at $1.9 billion. However, it\u2019s projected that the final amount will be less due to certain traders foreseeing price levels reaching $29,000 or even higher. The unexpected 12% correction in Bitcoin\u2019s price from Aug. 14 to Aug. 19 certainly took bullish investors off guard, as evident from the Deribit Bitcoin options interest chart.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for Aug. 25. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.56 put-to-call ratio reflects the imbalance between the $1.2 billion in call (buy) open interest and the $685 million in put (sell) options. However, if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $26,500 at 8:00 am UTC on Aug. 25, only $35 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $27,000 or $28,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nBitcoin bears aim for sub-$26,000 to maximize their gains\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Aug. 25 for call (buy) and put (sell) instruments varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit.\n\nThis crude estimate disregards more complex investment strategies. For instance, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nBetween $25,000 and $26,000: 100 calls vs. 15,100 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $380 million.\n\n100 calls vs. 15,100 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $380 million. Between $26,000 and $27,000: 1,400 calls vs. 11,000 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $250 million.\n\n1,400 calls vs. 11,000 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $250 million. Between $27,000 and $28,000: 4,000 calls vs. 8,400 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $110 million.\n\n4,000 calls vs. 8,400 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $110 million. Between $28,000 and $29,000: 6,000 calls vs. 5,300 puts. The net result is balanced between call and put options.\n\nTake note that for the bulls to level the playing field before the monthly expiry, they must achieve a 6% price increase from $26,400. In contrast, the bears only require a modest 2% correction below $26,000 to secure a $380 million advantage on Aug. 25.\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s repeated drops below the $26,000 support level from Aug. 21 to Aug. 23, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if this level was tested again before the options expiry. Furthermore, considering the current cryptocurrency regulatory landscape, there\u2019s minimal incentive for Bitcoin bulls to reverse the prevailing bearish momentum after the $1.9 billion monthly options expiry.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "BlackRock founder, chairman and CEO Larry Fink has said crypto represents a digitised alternative to popular hedging assets such as gold after his firm filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a bitcoin ETF.\n\nHaving previously been more neutral on digital assets than other prominent figures including Warren Buffett, the founder of the world\u2019s largest asset manager has recently been outspoken in favour of the asset class\u2019s potential and last year even describing tokenisation as the \u201cnext evolution\u201d in securities.\n\n\u201cCrypto is digitising gold in many ways,\u201d Fink said in a recent Fox News interview. \u201cInstead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country or the devaluation of your currency.\n\n\u201cAs I have said in the past, we are a believer in the digitisation of products. ETFs were a big revolution for the mutual fund industry and they are really taking over the mutual fund industry.\n\n\u201cWe believe if we can create more tokenisation of assets and securities \u2013 and that is what bitcoin is \u2013 that could once again revolutionise finance.\u201d\n\nFink continued, stating crypto assets and their underlying technology are an opportunity for asset managers to further \u201cdemocratise the cost of investing\u201d provide investors with fractionalised access to securities.\n\n\u201cRight now, the bid-ask spread for crypto is very expensive and it does erode a lot of the returns because it costs a lot of money to transact bitcoin.\n\n\u201cOver the last 10 years, we have lowered the cost of iShares ETFs by 30%. What we are trying to do with crypto is make it more democratised and much cheaper for investors.\u201d\n\nFimk\u2019s comments follow the firm\u2019s surprise move to file for a bitcoin ETF in the US in June.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust is vying to be the first spot bitcoin ETF in the US and will rely on Coinbase Custody for spot market data and storage of its underlying assets if approved.\n\n\u201cWe hope, like the past, we can work with our regulators and get this filing approved one day. I have no idea when this one day will be,\u201d Fink continued.\n\n\u201cI cannot get into any specifics but\u2026we work really closely with our regulators and we want to hear what their issues are and how we can fix those.\u201d\n\nBlackRock currently has a formidable track record of ETF approvals, with all but one of its 576 applications being approved by the SEC.\n\nThe firm\u2019s bitcoin ETF filing came within weeks of the regulator suing Coinbase for allegedly operating as an unregistered securities exchange.\n\nBlackRock first partnered with Coinbase last August to offer institutional clients using its Aladdin platform the ability to purchase bitcoin. BlackRock launched its own spot bitcoin trust for US institutional clients later that month.\n\nFellow spot bitcoin ETF applicant Grayscale Investments previously sued the SEC after the regulator thwarted its efforts to convert its spot bitcoin trust into an ETF. The regulator has once again delayed its verdict on Grayscale\u2019s recent spot bitcoin ETF application.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described BlackRock\u2019s move to enter the bitcoin ETF space as a \u201cshocker\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere have been no signs at all the SEC is willing to approve but BlackRock is a very connected company so maybe they know something,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, BlackRock noted \u201csignificant interest\u201d from clients in the asset class but told ETF Stream it had \u201cno plans\u201d to launch a crypto ETF.\n\nA spokesperson previously said: \u201cIt is worth noting that the SEC has yet to approve an application for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP).\n\n\u201cIn general, any decision as to whether to launch iShares ETPs is based on an array of factors including market and asset dynamics, regulatory considerations and client demand.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin ordinals inscriptions climbing steadily despite lull in prices - CNBC",
        "content": "Ordinals inscriptions have been consistently higher this summer while the price of bitcoin was in a lull. The number of ordinals recorded onto the bitcoin blockchain has spiked above 400,000 three times since July 30, surpassing the May high of 400,091, according to Dune Analytics. Twice in July the number jumped above 385,000. Ordinals are a new protocol that makes it possible to store and trade digital content on the bitcoin blockchain. The idea is similar to NFTs, barring some technical differences, and investors are excited about their ability to bring utility to the Bitcoin network beyond just trading its native token. \"The number of ordinals being inscribed is still going pretty solidly up and to the right,\" said Alex Miller, CEO of Hiro, a bitcoin developer tools company. \"People just want to be putting content and inscribing things onto the Bitcoin chain, which is why we're climbing at a steady rate.\" Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin is driven more by larger, more macro-level developments, he added. Ordinals first launched in February. Ordinals saw their first big spike in May, which led to a parabolic increase in bitcoin transaction fees . Given the newness of the idea, however, it's anyone's guess what it's adoption trajectory will be \u2014 especially given the former hype and uncertainty around their cousins, NFTs. Although NFTs have a wide range of potential utility, they became largely known as digital art and a concept lost on many. The recent ramp in ordinals activity came amid a pullback in NFT trading, Miller explained. Bitcoin transaction fee activity has been more muted in recent weeks. \"Transaction fees went crazy high because people were running large inscriptions, especially the initial setup ones for BRC-20 coins,\" Miller explained about the first spike this year. \"The inscriptions of late have been smaller and more efficient.\" That's due in part to a technical feature that allows users to save space on chain when recording data by referencing other existing inscriptions. These \"recursive inscriptions\" both \"make the art that you're seeing now, but the other thing is people are using this to figure out different ways to use the underlying technology that can get recombined and reused in different ways in the future for no- art based things as well.\""

        "content": "Our weekly roundup of news from East Asia curates the industry\u2019s most important developments.\n\nHashKey Hong Kong to commence retail trading\n\nCrypto exchange HashKey, the first licensed virtual asset provider in Hong Kong, will open its doors to residents for retail trading on Aug. 28.\n\nAccording to local news reports, investors will only be allowed to invest up to 30% of their net worth into cryptocurrencies when using the platform. A risk control warning will be displayed if the limit is exceeded. However, Xiaoqi Weng, chief operating officer of HashKey, mentioned that the exchange \u201ccannot validate users\u2019 net worth,\u201d and the limit is largely based on \u201cself-verification\u201d of assets.\n\nWeng also disclosed that the exchange will assess users\u2019 investment background based on information submitted during Know Your Customer verification. \u201cBeginners are limited in what they can purchase,\u201d said Weng.\n\nAt its debut, users can only trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) on HashKey Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission has not yet allowed the margin trading of crypto products or crypto derivatives on regulated exchanges, Weng noted.\n\nDark side of China\u2019s crypto crackdown\n\nIt appears China no longer wants any private blockchain firms operating within its borders and is on the warpath to get rid of them, no matter the consequences. The move comes amid an increase in using crypto as a means of capital flight in an economic downturn.\n\nLocal media reports suggest that, legitimate or not, blockchain projects in China have literal bounties on their heads. First, third-party tracking firms tip off the police on undercover crypto projects in the country; if the report leads to arrest and asset forfeiture, the tracking firm stands to make millions of dollars in commission \u2014 if not hundreds of millions of dollars for large-scale projects such as Multichain.\n\nA recent tip-off led to a 400 billion yuan ($55 billion) crypto money laundering bust by Chinese police. (DouYin)\n\nThen, after arrest, crypto executives are reportedly intimidated into handing over the project\u2019s private keys and access to servers. Police then allegedly get third-party payment processors to \u201cdump\u201d the coins and tokens over-the-counter in exchange for Chinese yuan.\n\nCrypto executives are then charged with operating a \u201cmultilevel marketing scheme,\u201d \u201cpyramid scheme,\u201d or \u201cmoney laundering.\u201d If convicted, the charges result in the seizure of all protocol-related assets by the state.\n\nSources claim that a portion of the funds goes into law enforcement agency revenue. Zhengyao Liu, a senior lawyer at the Shanghai Mankuen Law Firm, wrote:\n\n\u201cIn fact, in the past two years, the profit-seeking law enforcement in crypto-related criminal cases, especially in crypto-related MLM cases, has been the main reason people do not trust the case-handling agencies. For example, the \u2018contribution\u2019 of crypto-related criminal cases to financial fines and confiscation revenues is more than 50% higher than in previous years in the Jiangsu Province.\u201d\n\nThe crackdown has led to the termination of several protocols this year, with little recourse for non-Chinese users with funds stuck on these platforms. Unsurprisingly, it has sparked a wave of emigration among Chinese Web3 founders and overseas law enforcement efforts to try and recover the \u201cstuck\u201d funds.\n\nThe last message sent by Chinese exchange BKEX before its entire platform shut down and its staff disappeared. (BKEX)\n\nDigital yuan green bonds debut\n\nDespite the draconian crackdown on private crypto activities, government-led blockchain efforts in China are doing quite well.\n\nOn August 18, the first digital yuan central bank digital currency green bond was issued with a principal amount of 100 million Chinese yuan ($14 million), a term of two years, and a coupon rate of 2.6% per annum.\n\nFacilitated by the Bank of Ningbo, the loans will be used to finance a 1.4 gigawatt and a 1.0 GW solar panel facility expansion project in Wuxi.\n\nThe digital yuan CBDC has been repeatedly \u201cshilled\u201d for much of this year as a means of stimulating domestic spending amid a financial crisis within the country. In the city of Tianjin alone, digital yuan transaction volumes have surpassed $17.5 billion in the first half of 2023, with over 302,000 merchants accepting the CBDC as a means of payment.\n\nFBI tracks $41 million in North Korean crypto\n\nOn Aug. 22, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation announced the identification of 1,580 BTC ($41 million) stolen from various projects by North Korean hackers. The six displayed wallets include funds stolen from the $60 million Alphapo hack in June, $37 million stolen from CoinsPaid in June, and $100 million stolen from Atomic Wallet in June. The FBI wrote:\n\n\u201cPrivate sector entities should examine the blockchain data associated with these addresses and be vigilant in guarding against transactions directly with, or derived from, the addresses. The FBI will continue to expose and combat the DPRK\u2019s use of illicit activities \u2014 including cybercrime and virtual currency theft \u2014 to generate revenue for the regime.\u201d\n\nThe agency said it believes North Korea will attempt to cash out the stolen funds. Criminal investigations into North Korean hackers\u2019 role in the Harmony\u2019s Horizon Bridge and Sky Mavis\u2019 Ronin Bridge exploits last year are still ongoing.\n\nChinese Bitcoin mining magnate sentenced to life in prison\n\nYi Xiao, a former vice chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Political Consultative Conference Party Group, has reportedly been sentenced to life in prison by the Hangzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court for unrelated charges of corruption and abuse of power in a Bitcoin mining enterprise.\n\nAccording to local news reports on August 22, Yi Xiao operated a 2.4 billion Chinese yuan ($329 million) Bitcoin mining enterprise under the corporate name Jiumu Group Genesis Technology from 2017 to 2021. Despite knowing about a ban on cryptocurrencies, Xiao amassed over 160,000 Bitcoin miners with other corporate executives and, at one time, 10% of the city of Fuzhou\u2019s entire electricity consumption.\n\nXiao was convicted of using his public office to secure preferential subsidies, capital, and electricity supply for the Jiamu Group. The former official also used his position to fabricate statistical reports to conceal the operations\u2019 true nature.\n\nStarting this year, China has been cracking down harshly on crypto activities amid a spree of data theft and money laundering incidences involving digital assets. Earlier this month, a Chinese national was sentenced to nine months in prison for purchasing $13,067 worth of Tether (USDT) for an acquaintance.\n\nYi Xiao, awaiting sentencing on charges of corruption and abuse of power (Hangzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court)"

        "content": "The Cayman Islands has long been an idyllic beach getaway for tourists, but the archipelago could soon welcome Bitcoin (BTC) holders as new residents through BTC-backed loans used to invest in real estate.\n\nBitcoin banking firm Ledn, which is registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority as a virtual assets service provider (VASP), is providing an avenue for Bitcoin holders to use their BTC as collateral for loans to invest in real estate on the islands.\n\nThis is just one avenue that prospective new residents of the islands could take to obtain citizenship, with investments over $2.4 million in real estate in the Cayman Islands qualifying a buyer for permanent residency.\n\nRelated: Noted tax haven Cayman Islands sees new bills to bring local crypto to FATF\u2019s heel\n\nSpeaking directly to Cointelegraph, Ledn CEO Adam Reeds unpacked a new partnership with local real estate agency Parallel, which has also facilitated a number of cryptocurrency-based property sales in the Cayman Islands.\n\n\u201cLedn will provide real estate buyers in the Caymans with crypto-backed loans, which Parallel will accept as a means to finance purchases. Parallel will only accept borrowed funds if they\u2019ve been loaned by Ledn \u2014 it is an exclusive partnership in this sense.\u201d\n\nAccording to Reeds, Parallel handles conversion to fiat currency if either a buyer or seller prefers the option over a cryptocurrency payment. Meanwhile, Ledn\u2019s portion of any transaction will be fiat-free, paid in either BTC or United States dollar-backed stablecoins.\n\n\u201cParallel is a crypto-centric real estate broker in the Caymans, so users can now finance their purchase of real estate completely fiat-free.\u201d\n\nIt is also possible for cryptocurrency holders to pay for a property with crypto in the Cayman Islands through Parallel. Reeds, however, highlighted a potential draw card in that investors can leverage their BTC holdings as collateral without selling a portion.\n\n\u201cThen if or when BTC goes up, your loan-to-value ratio goes down, so your house is appreciating, and so is the asset you\u2019re borrowing against.\u201d\n\nGiven that Parallel has previously sold real estate in cryptocurrency-facilitated transfers, Reeds added that both companies have seen demands for the service to finance significant property transactions.\n\nThe real estate firm sold a $10 million property in December 2022, which was paid for entirely in cryptocurrency. The company is also registered as a VASP with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, allowing it to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nBoth Ledn and Parallel must adhere to comprehensive compliance requirements as part of their registration with the local monetary authority.\n\nThe concept of attaining residency by investment involving cryptocurrencies is not entirely new. Vanuatu claims to be the first country to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment to obtain citizenship by investment.\n\nA number of other countries have emerged as cryptocurrency-friendly destinations to try and obtain citizenship. Portugal, Malta and El Salvador have all emerged as relatively crypto-friendly countries, but it is still not possible to directly invest in Bitcoin to obtain or be eligible for residency.\n\nMagazine: Tokenizing music royalties as NFTs could help the next Taylor Swift"

Investors will only be allowed to invest up to 30% of their net worth into cryptocurrencies when using the platform.\n\nHashKey became the first crypto exchange in Hong Kong to get regulatory clearance to offer crypto trading services to retail traders after upgrading two major licenses issued by the country\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). The first license, known as Type 1, made way for HashKey to start a virtual asset trading platform under Hong Kong\u2019s securities laws. The second license, called Type 7, allows the crypto exchange to provide automated trading services to both institutional and retail users.\n\nApart from HashKey, another crypto platform called OSL also received a regulatory nod from the SFC to offer BTC and ETH retail trading services. The new license regime has made way for Hong Kong to establish itself as one of the few countries that allow crypto retail trading services under the pureview of law.\n\nHong Kong started the year 2023 with a focus on building a crypto friendly environment in the country. Hong Kong\u2019 Financial Secretary Paul Chan noted at the start of the year that the local government and regulators are looking forward to building a crypto and fintech ecosystem in 2023.\n\nRelated: Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia collaborate on tokens and payments\n\nBy March, more than 80 crypto firms had expressed interest in opening their offices in Hong Kong, including several crypto heavy weights. In April, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) called on banks to provide services to cryptocurrency firms. By May of the same year, the HKMA had announced a licensing regime for the crypto platforms with a deadline of June 1. By August, a couple of crypto platforms had been approved to offer crypto trading services to retail and institutional clients.\n\nThe role of the regulatory framework that helps to protect investors is quite evident in the case of Hong Kong, where retail traders will have access to only BTC and ETH, which the exchange believes is enough for the retail traders\u2019 need.\n\nHashKey didn\u2019t respond to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comments before publication time.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Hall of Flame: Wolf Of All Streets worries about a world where Bitcoin hits $1M"

        "title": "Institutional Players Embrace Bitcoin: What It Means for the Market - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "In recent years, the cryptocurrency environment has undergone extraordinary change, with one of the most significant transitions being the increased interest and participation of institutional players in the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin, long regarded as a volatile and speculative asset, is rapidly gaining acceptance as a genuine investment alternative among institutional investors.\n\nWe dive into key trends of institutional actors embracing Bitcoin, examining the ramifications for the cryptocurrency market, traditional finance, and the global economy as a whole.\n\nThe Changing Nature of Institutional Interest\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have traditionally been associated with individual investors and computer enthusiasts. However, a tectonic change has occurred in recent years. Investment businesses, hedge funds, family offices, and even publicly traded organizations have begun to commit a portion of their holdings to Bitcoin.\n\nUnpacking the Institutional Shift\n\nBitcoin's institutional acceptance represents a fundamental shift in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This tendency has far-reaching repercussions for a variety of stakeholders:\n\nLegitimacy and Validation: Institutional involvement gives the cryptocurrency market legitimacy and validation. Traditional finance participants contribute a level of due diligence, regulatory compliance, and risk assessment that can act as a catalyst for wider acceptance. Price Dynamics and Market Stability: The entry of institutional investors has the potential to influence the price dynamics of Bitcoin. While retail investors may respond more emotionally to market volatility, institutional investors tend to take a longer-term perspective, which may contribute to enhanced market stability. Institutional participation Resulting in increasing Mainstream Awareness and Education: Institutional participation always results in increasing mainstream awareness. As major financial news sites cover institutional interest in Bitcoin, the general public gains a better understanding of the asset class, potentially leading to additional entrants and investors. Regulatory Considerations: The arrival of institutional players frequently sparks regulatory debates and considerations. Regulators may step up their inspection to protect investors and guarantee market integrity. Maintaining institutional engagement requires regulatory certainty. Trading Infrastructure and Liquidity: Institutional participants require sophisticated trading infrastructure, such as regulated exchanges, custody solutions, and liquidity pools. The requirement for such infrastructure promotes cryptocurrency ecosystem innovation and improvement. Market Diversification: Institutional participants add diversity to the market, which can assist alleviate concentration problems. Diversification helps to create a more balanced and robust market ecosystem.\n\nInstitutional Adoption of Bitcoin: Catalysts and Players\n\nInstitutional adoption of Bitcoin is witnessing remarkable growth, as key players across sectors embrace the cryptocurrency.\n\nFinancial institutions, technology firms, and investment companies are propelling this transformative shift, driven by distinct motivations.\n\nFinancial Institutions:\n\nDiversification and Portfolio Management: Bitcoin presents an alternative asset class, offering potential returns while reducing portfolio risk.\n\nClient Demand: Meeting clients' cryptocurrency interests retains customer loyalty and prevents attrition to rivals.\n\nHedge Against Economic Uncertainty: Bitcoin's decentralized nature and limited supply safeguard against currency devaluation and economic uncertainty.\n\nTechnology Companies:\n\nInnovation and Market Expansion: Integrating Bitcoin bolsters innovation and positions companies at the forefront of technological trends.\n\nSeamless Payments: Bitcoin's blockchain facilitates swift, secure cross-border transactions, making it ideal for payment processors and digital services.\n\nInvestment Firms:\n\nPotential Returns: Bitcoin's historical price performance allures investment firms aiming to generate alpha and outperform traditional markets.\n\nPortfolio Diversification: Adding Bitcoin diversifies investment strategies, minimizing risk and enhancing performance.\n\nStore of Value: As a digital store of value akin to gold, Bitcoin preserves wealth amid a digitally-driven world.\n\nInstitutional involvement signifies growing acceptance and recognition of Bitcoin's transformative impact. The participation of key players fosters stability, liquidity, and credibility in the cryptocurrency market, propelling Bitcoin's trajectory and integration into the broader financial ecosystem.\n\nWhat is the source of institutional interest?\n\nSeveral factors contribute to institutional investors' growing interest in Bitcoin:\n\nNarrative of a Store of Value: The narrative of Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" has acquired popularity among institutional investors. Bitcoin's scarcity, combined with its decentralized structure, puts it as a possible hedge against traditional financial market dangers. Inflation Fears: Central banks' unprecedented monetary policies in response to the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 epidemic have sparked concerns about impending inflation. Bitcoin is viewed by institutional investors as a hedge against currency depreciation and inflation risks. Potential for huge Returns: While some investors are put off by Bitcoin's volatility, others see it as a chance for potentially huge returns. Institutional investors with a risk appetite may be drawn to Bitcoin's historical price performance. Diversification Strategy: Institutional investors frequently strive to diversify their holdings in order to reduce risk. Bitcoin is a unique uncorrelated asset class that can help diversify portfolios.\n\nConclusion: A Changing Environment\n\nFinally, the institutional acceptance of Bitcoin represents a paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The ramifications of traditional finance colliding with the new arena of digital assets go far beyond price movements. The involvement of institutions brings legitimacy, market maturity, and increasing public awareness. It does, however, introduce regulatory concerns and the requirement for robust infrastructure.\n\nThe synergy between traditional banking and innovative technology is redefining the future of finance as the cryptocurrency market evolves under the influence of institutional actors. The road forward entails negotiating regulatory frameworks, fine-tuning investment strategies, and encouraging deeper collaboration between the two areas. The institutional acceptance of Bitcoin is more than just an investment trend; it represents a watershed moment in the convergence of finance and technology."

        "content": "On Aug. 24, Cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced its intention to modify its zero-fee Bitcoin (BTC) trading program starting Sept. 7. The action has the potential to initiate a significant market downturn, reminiscent of the 90% trading volume decline observed following Binance\u2019s discontinuation of zero-fee trading in March.\n\nIn an official statement, Binance said it intends to modify zero-fee Bitcoin trading for the BTC/TUSD spot and margin trading pair.\n\nPreviously, traders experienced zero maker and taker fees while engaging in BTC trading with TUSD pairs. However, a regular taker fee will now be implemented based on the user\u2019s VIP level. Nonetheless, users will still encounter no maker fees when conducting Bitcoin trades on the BTC/TUSD spot and margin trading pair.\n\n\u201cThe corresponding trading volume on the BTC/TUSD spot and margin trading pair will count toward VIP tier calculation and all Liquidity Provider programs. In addition, BNB discounts, referral rebates, and any other fee adjustments will resume for BTC/TUSD spot and margin trading volumes.\u201d\n\nThe program's discontinuation may indicate a decreased backing for the TrueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin due to various concerns. Importantly, users will still retain the privilege of zero maker and taker fees while engaging in Bitcoin trading within the First Digital USD (FDUSD) spot and margin trading pair.\n\nThe adjustment could inadvertently incite another round of selloffs in the market.\n\nRelated: Binance dubs barred Russian banks on its platform as \u2018Yellow\u2019 and \u2018Green\u2019 cards\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the BTC/TUSD and BTC/USDT pairs are the most frequently traded for Bitcoin, constituting 11% and 7%, respectively. The trading volume in Tether (USDT) pairs experienced a significant drop after Binance stopped supporting Binance USD (BUSD) and designated TUSD as the sole trading pair for zero-fee Bitcoin trading.\n\nYet again, the exchange is redirecting attention away from the widely traded TUSD to the lesser-known FDUSD stablecoin. Notably, FDUSD doesn\u2019t rank within the top 10 Bitcoin pairs by trading volume, with the market capitalization of FDUSD standing at $324 million.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty has hit a new all-time high despite the digital asset\u2019s less-than-stellar price performance of late.\n\nMining difficulty refers to how competitive it is to mine Bitcoin (BTC). The difficulty rises as more mining units get deployed, and thus suggests that the activity continues to be a profitable and popular enterprise.\n\nAccording to data from CoinWarz, Bitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty is 55.62 trillion hashes. The network's last notable peak was 53.9 trillion hashes on July 17 this year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"The deployment is an arm\u2019s race. Everyone is putting as much as possible online before the halving. You can see this with Hut8, Canaan, and Riot,\" co-founder of mining firm LSJ Ops Scott Norris told Decrypt. \"We\u2019re also seeing Antpool and other Chinese firms growing hash rate at a pace we haven\u2019t seen in over a year. Whatsminer has shipped their latest generation machines already and their hash abilities are growing substantially.\"\n\nDespite the milestone, markets currently tell a different story.\n\nInvestor sentiment towards Bitcoin turned bearish last week after Chinese property giant Evergrande filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in a Manhattan court, pushing some investors to dump their more speculative assets.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price fell 10.8% over the last 7 days to trade a fraction south of $26,000 on Wednesday, per CoinGecko.\n\nHowever, the mining sector moves relatively slowly, so more positive metrics like its rising difficulty or hash rate are not typically reactive to Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s because most rigs that came online in the last 24 hours were paid for long in advance.\n\nBitcoin mining stats on the up\n\nCertain events can significantly pull down the metric\u2014such as China\u2019s 2021 crackdown against crypto miners, or a cold snap in North America last winter that caused some operational problems to the grid, prompting some big miners to either shut down or curtail power.\n\nHowever, when those machines relocate or come back online, the data usually shows a marked upward adjustment.\n\nBroadly speaking, mining difficulty is constantly climbing year-on-year. That\u2019s because every year more machines are deployed than shut down.\n\nAnother metric that climbed recently\u2013and that is also always climbing every year\u2013is hash rate. Hash rate measures the computing power of the Bitcoin network.\n\nBitcoin mining rigs use their power to break codes to validate logs of transactions on the network\u2014called \u201cblocks\u201d\u2014which are then added to Bitcoin\u2019s immutable distributed ledger system. Miners are rewarded for this work with Bitcoin.\n\nEach attempt at cracking the encryption generates a code called a \u201chash.\u201d The first miner to transmit the valid hash for their candidate block gets the reward and gets added to the blockchain. Miners are thus incentivized to work quickly.\n\nThe higher the hash rate is, the more attempts (or hashes) Bitcoin miners can make within a second to break the code\u2014a clear indicator of the network\u2019s computational power.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday, Bitcoin is making 446 quintillion codebreaking attempts every second.\n\nThat\u2019s high but not quite as high as earlier this month, when the network was making almost 486 quintillion attempts every second."

        "title": "Must Reads On Bitcoin, Options & SPY Returns - ETF Trends",
        "content": "By Cinthia Murphy\n\nResearch is often a collective effort. This week, we wanted to highlight some interesting work we\u2019ve come across from our friends in the industry \u2013 our midsummer reading list, if you will.\n\nThe Latest on Spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs may be upon us\u2026sometime \u2018soonish.\u2019\n\nWe have certainly spilled an enormous amount of ink on this issue, especially since BlackRock\u2019s muscle entered the fight mid-June with an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. We are now approaching 10 providers in this race, which is now 8 years in the making, and the SEC remains reluctant to bite.\n\nWe also have the existing Bitcoin-futures and Bitcoin-related funds that are already navigating the space. They include:\n\nContent continues below advertisement\n\nIf you are an advisor, you probably need to stay relatively informed so that you can field client questions.\n\nTo that end, Ric Edelman, veteran investor, advisor, and author who\u2019s also founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, just published a white paper that may be an interesting resource to you. Titled \u201cWhat You Need to Know About Spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201c the paper explores the history, the current state and the potential future impact of accessing Bitcoin through ETFs.\n\nConsider this: \u201cOnly 12% of financial advisors currently recommend Bitcoin to clients, but more than three-fourths of advisors (77%) say they will recommend a spot Bitcoin ETF when they become available,\u201d Edelman says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that two-thirds of the nation\u2019s investors rely on financial advisors for investment recommendations,\u201d he adds, suggesting that a go-ahead from the advisory space could unleash a massive wave of demand. If true, this could be huge because Bitcoin has inelastic, finite supply. It\u2019s that kind of thinking that has many of us in the industry seating on the edge of our seats waiting to see what happens next in this approval race.\n\nFor now, Edelman shares his views on what\u2019s at stake, and offers 5 key risks to consider when investing in a spot Bitcoin ETF, whenever they are available. It\u2019s a handy guide that addresses market risk, regulatory risk, operational risk, liquidity risk and tracking risk.\n\nA Little About 0DTE Options\n\nOptions seem to be everywhere these days in ETF land. Roughly 20% of ETF launches so far in 2023 have been options-based ETFs.\n\nBroadly speaking, options can serve many roles in a strategy, but in ETF wrappers they are often being implemented to achieve one of two outcomes: income generation or downside protection. (Think, for example, ETF lineups such as YieldMax and Innovator, among many others.)\n\nThe single largest actively managed ETF today is an options-based ETF seeking income, JEPI. The fund is nearing $30 billion in assets and its massive asset-gathering success has now several copycats from other providers currently sitting in registration. Options-based ETF investing, as a segment, has serious momentum behind it both in terms of product development and investor demand.\n\nAs an advisor, it is important to understand how options work and how they work within ETF portfolios \u2013 their benefits and their risks. (We\u2019ve written about the innerworkings of JEPI recently for that reason.) To quote Joshua Wilson, head of advisory group United Ethos, there\u2019s a lot to consider when looking at options-linked ETFs. At a high level, consider for instance:\n\nThe timing of entry and exit from a buffer-type fund, which has a big impact on the upside capture and downside protection levels achieved outside of reset day. \u201cIt\u2019s something people often look over.\u201d\n\nThe cost of transacting in the options market, which can vary over time. Price to volatility, time cost \u2013 all these variables matter. \u201cWith options, there are several variables that stocks don\u2019t have to consider. That\u2019s best understood by remembering that options are nothing more than publicly traded insurance contracts. When fear goes up, costs go up.\u201d\n\nThe risk of poor trading execution for ETFs, which run the risk of seeing rollover of options gamed by the market on expiration. \u201cIt\u2019s like an index. Around reconstitution, some stocks benefit and some are hurt by it. If you get ahead of those days and know what big institutions are going to do, you can trade that to your advantage. There can be a gaming of these large positions at rollover period, especially as these ETFs grow very large.\u201d\n\nMore granularly, one of the quickly growing areas of the options market is 0DTEs (zero days to expiration options). Cboe Global Markets just released a white paper titled \u201cThe Rise of SPX & 0DTE Options\u201d that could be an interesting resource for options research.\n\nSenior Derivatives Analyst Jonathan Zaionz, author of the paper, points out that options volume growth, annually, has more than doubled since 2019 from its earlier stride of 11% annual growth since 2000. That\u2019s largely thanks to the surge in usage in index (SPX) and 0DTE options.\n\nHe notes that trading in SPX options neared 3 million contracts a day, on average, in the first half of the year, and more than 40% of that volume was in 0DTEs. \u201cWhile only accounting for approximately 6% of total options volume traded daily, SPX options represent approximately 33% of total dollars in premium traded, and over 50% of notional exposure traded.\u201d\n\nAccording to Zaionz: \u201cInitially, options volume growth was the largest in options on single name equities as investors took a liking to stocks such as Tesla, GameStop, and AMC. Since late 2021, several types of investors have shifted their preference away from single stock options to broad based index options such as SPX. Growth in SPX options is more than double that of the rest of the options market since 2020, with a substantial portion of that growth coming from 0DTE trading.\u201d\n\nThe white paper is full of interesting data that explores use cases, popular strategies, costs, market impact, benefits, and risks of investing in these options. It\u2019s on our must-read list this summer.\n\nShout Out to Data Nerds\n\nAs a final note, our friend Nick Maggiulli, COO at Ritholtz Wealth Management and author of personal finance blog Of Dollars And Data, released this week his latest data tool: a S&P 500 Historical Return Calculator. You can play with it here: https://ofdollarsanddata.com/sp500-calculator/\n\nThis tool allows you to research both nominal and inflation-adjusted returns (with and without dividend reinvestment) for the S&P 500 dating back to 1871.\n\nMaggiulli offers best practices, how-tos and things to consider when playing around with the calculator. It\u2019s a cool little piece of tech that can come in handy when you are looking for that market perspective.\n\nHappy reading!\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the ETF Strategist Channel.\n\nDisclosure\n\nAll investments involve risk, including possible loss of principal.\n\nThe material provided here is for informational purposes only and should not be considered an individualized recommendation or personalized investment advice.

        "content": "Filbfilb analyzes Bitcoin\u2019s halving pattern to predict an explosive Q4 for BTC price action.\n\nThe familiar Bitcoin halving cycle has turned heads again, hinting at a significant shift in BTC price behavior as the final quarter of 2023 approaches. With industry experts closely monitoring the trend, many smart investors are taking advantage of the situation, positioning themselves for a notable surge in value.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price seems destined to remain rangebound until at least the fourth quarter of 2023, a prediction made by Filbfilb, an esteemed market analyst and co-founder of the crypto analytics platform Decentrader.\n\nAs revealed in a thread on X (previously known as Twitter), Filbfilb advised his followers that they should brace for stagnation in BTC price leading into the year\u2019s end. This advice comes despite a bullish 70% gain for Bitcoin in Q1.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/filbfilb/status/1695009209513922609\n\nWhat does the Bitcoin halving cycle pattern tell us?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current situation isn\u2019t raising much cheer among bulls. Yet, Filbfilb observes little change in Bitcoin\u2019s price action during this halving cycle compared to previous ones.\n\nThe digital currency finds itself 1200 days after the last halving, during which it typically consolidates. By examining various comparative charts, Filbfilb predicts miners will likely start to push prices higher as the Bitcoin halving approaches \u2013 which has historically occurred around 1,276 days after each preceding halving.\n\nMiners are motivated to secure prices that exceed marginal costs leading up to the halving. Regardless of whether they actively collude, they share a collective drive to boost prices before their marginal revenue is cut in half. Filbfilb added that this effect, in combination with intelligent investors keen on seizing opportunities around the potential positive price impact of Bitcoin halving, has previously bolstered the market.\n\nThis calculation leads to early November as a prospective deadline for these behaviors to manifest.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin halving: what it is and how it may affect the price\n\nFrom a chronological standpoint, Filbfilb suggests that the fourth quarter appears vital for Bitcoin. During this time, he expects a constrained supply and an influx of new capital driven by speculation.\n\nConcluding his analysis, Filbfilb anticipates an explosive Q4 for Bitcoin. During this period, the interplay between historical patterns and contemporary market dynamics could set the stage for a riveting close to the year. The savvy investors and Bitcoin enthusiasts who heed these signals may find themselves well-positioned to capitalize on what could be a transformative moment in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nWhile Filbfilb\u2019s analysis provides an insightful perspective on Bitcoin\u2019s potential price trajectory, it\u2019s essential to recognize the inherent volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. Users should always perform their own due diligence, research, and risk assessment before making investments.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "On the latest episode of Macro Markets, Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman explains why United States consumption remains strong while auto-loan and credit card balance delinquency is accelerating. According to Pechman, consumers built a cushion of extra cash savings as the U.S. government injected money to avoid a recession and temporarily forgave student loan repayments.\n\nBut, according to investment bank JPMorgan, \u201cconsumers have spent down the entirety of their excess savings from the pandemic, which at one point totaled more than $2 trillion,\u201d as reported by Business Insider. Pechman believes that if JPMorgan\u2019s predictions are correct, the stock market should have been trading much lower. Still, Pechman doesn\u2019t think that betting against the S&P 500 is sound advice, given that inflation is right around the corner and the government will be forced to inject liquidity to avoid a recession.\n\nFor the show\u2019s next topic, Pechman dissects the Chinese central bank\u2019s intervention after the yuan hit a 16-year low against the U.S. dollar. For Pechman, the biggest risk is the market doubting the country\u2019s ability to sustain a stronger yuan, meaning betting that the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s reserves won\u2019t be enough to sustain the desired level.\n\nIn essence, what the Chinese central bank is doing has limits and ultimately is a risky bet, argues Pechman. For now, according to the analyst, there seems to be no imminent risk coming from the yuan, but it is worth keeping an eye on.\n\nFor further insights into these matters, tune in to the latest episode of Macro Markets, exclusively available on the newly launched Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel."

Meanwhile, BTC volume in the last 24 hours stood at approximately $16.09 billion, rising 1.76% in the last 24 hours.\"For the market to turn bullish again, a breach of $28,400 resistance by Bitcoin is necessary in the coming weeks. Markets await US Fed Chair Powell\u2019s speech at an annual conference this Friday to determine its direction with clarity on macro-economic trends,\" Vikram Subburaj, CEO, Giottus Crypto Platform, said.The market cap of bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was around $515 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 48.36%, an increase of 0.07% over the day, according to CoinMarketCap.Bitcoin has been trading above the $26000 level. This could be indicative of the market awaiting a decision on the Bitcoin-ETF in the US, Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder of Mudrex said.Ethereum continues to trade above the $1600 mark. Altcoins like Stellar and Hedera saw more than 5% growth in the last 24 hours. This renewed interest in altcoins and AI-related cryptocurrencies could be because of AI and computer-chip giant Nvidia reporting Q2 revenue of $13.51 billion versus consensus estimates of $11.19 billion, Edul said.Bitcoin's recent sideways movement following a significant drop on August 17th indicates uncertainty among both bullish and bearish participants. Consequently, it's wise to await a breakout before making substantial trading decisions.The elongated lower shadow on Bitcoin's candlestick chart for August 22nd is a positive signal, suggesting strong efforts from bulls to defend the $24,800 support level. Nonetheless, bullish momentum will remain subdued until the price surpasses the resistance levels at $26,833 and subsequently the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $27,777.

        "content": "Since August 2010, there have been only 677 days in which you could have bought Bitcoin and currently be at a loss, with 86% of days where \u2018holding Bitcoin has been profitable relative to today\u2019s price,\u2019 as per Coinglass data.\n\nData from Coinglass shows that entities who purchased Bitcoin on any one of the other 4,081 days are in profit as of press time. The chart below shows the days in red, which days Bitcoin purchased would have led to a loss by today\u2019s price, and green for purchases now in profit.\n\nAs a percentage, there are only 14% of the total days since 2010, where purchasers are now at a loss.\n\nHowever, with Bitcoin down over 60% from its all-time high, currently, only 61% of addresses are actually in profit. Therefore, 39% of entities added to their positions on one of the identified 677 unprofitable days.\n\nThe highest number of addresses in profit this year came on July 13, the day of the XRP ruling, at 79%, with the year starting at just 52%.\n\nCoinglass\u2019s \u2018Bitcoin Bubble Index\u2019 indicates the likelihood that the top cryptocurrency is in a bubble based on health metrics such as Google trends, Bitcoin difficulty, and transactions.\n\nAt present, with over 60% of holders in profit, the chart shows a negative possibility of a bubble, indicating a healthy network with upside potential.\n\nThe sub-metrics of the index show a declining search volume on Google while Bitcoin difficulty, number of transactions, and transaction value are all close to all-time highs and trending upward.\n\nTherefore, while there are entities currently holding at a loss, the majority are in profit, with only Google interest trending down.\n\nNotably, the major spikes around Google search volume for Bitcoin surround halvings. The next halving will occur in less than six months, and, one could say, the network has never been healthier.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "ARK, Glassnode propose Bitcoin economic analytics framework using new metric - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "ARK Invest and Glassnode have released white papers describing a proposed framework for analyzing Bitcoin on-chain metrics. The new method is called Cointime Economics and introduces a new measure \u2014 the coinblock \u2014 to represent the state of the Bitcoin (BTC) network.\n\nCointime Economics can be used to represent Bitcoin\u2019s economic state in place of outstanding supply. The use of the new system may improve valuation metrics and provide a new analytical tool to measure Bitcoin activity, according to authors David Puell of ARK Invest and James Check of Glassnode. They said:\n\n\u201cThe importance of a single bitcoin should vary based on the last time it moved. Upon its transfer, for example, the information value of a bitcoin that had been unmoved for 10 years is more important than one that had been unmoved for 1 week.\u201d\n\nThe reasoning behind this supposition is found in a footnote:\n\n\u201cCoins held for a prolonged period of time suggest ownership by the market cohort with the longest time investment horizon and the most profitable cost basis. They therefore display the market behavior of the largest capitalized and historically most savvy market participants in Bitcoin\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nThus, when long-dormant Bitcoin is moved, it is likely to be the action of hodlers and whales, and so is more significant than actions with more newly mined Bitcoin. Lost Bitcoin does not count at all.\n\nA coinblock is the basic unit used for calculation. It is determined by multiplying the number of Bitcoin by the number of blocks (the basic unit of mining) produced while the Bitcoin sits idle. \u201cBecause the Bitcoin network produces a block every 10 minutes on average, one coin generates approximately 144 coinblocks per day: 6 blocks produced per hour multiplied by 24 hours,\u201d the authors write.\n\nCoinblocks are \u201cdestroyed\u201d in line with the length of time the Bitcoin was held: \u201cIf two bitcoins had not moved in seven blocks and then transacted, for example, 14 coinblocks would have been destroyed.\u201d Bitcoin that had been held longer thus produces a larger number of coinblocks destroyed, pointing to higher activity by hodlers. Coinblocks destroyed is a variation of coindays destroyed, a metric that Glassnode already employs.\n\nAll Bitcoin coinblocks. Source: ARK Investment Management\n\nIn comparison, the traditional unspent transaction output (UTXO) model, which is essential to many settlement systems, gives all Bitcoin equal weight. Because of this difference, the overall amount of active and inactive Bitcoins is represented differently in the two models, giving differing views of the market.\n\nRelated: Brace for BTC price volatility? Bitcoin \u2018coin days destroyed\u2019 metric jumps to 2-month highs\n\nUnder UTXO, inactive Bitcoin is that which miners have not spent. In Cointime Economics, it is the so-called \u201cvaulted supply,\u201d which is the total number of coinblocks created divided by the total number not destroyed (that is, \u201cstored\u201d).\n\nIs Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate underestimated? ARK's @dpuellARK and @glassnode's @_Checkmatey_ explain why this may be the case in our new white paper, Cointime Economics. https://t.co/bdkmARE4HY \u2014 ARK Invest (@ARKInvest) August 24, 2023\n\nThe white paper provides three use cases to demonstrate the utility of Cointime Economics. A more advanced version of the paper for blockchain specialists is also available from Glassnode, along with a suite of Cointime Economics metrics.\n\nARK Invest is the investment management company founded by Cathie Wood. Glassnode is a Swiss-based market intelligence service.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "content": "Why Bitcoin Mining from Home Can Still Be Profitable In Latin AmericaPhoto: Valeria Mongelli/Bloomberg(Bloomberg/Valeria Mongelli)\n\nThe price of the most popular cryptocurrency is still far from its all-time high, but in countries where energy is cheap, mining at home can still be profitable\n\nWhy Bitcoin Mining from Home Can Still Be Profitable In Latin America\n\nBloomberg L\u00ednea \u2014 Bitcoin (XBT) has seen a price recovery in 2023, gaining almost 60% from December 2022 to date, but it remains 61% below its all-time high of $67,734.04. However, the low cost of energy in some Latin American countries allows home mining of the most popular cryptocurrency to continue to be profitable in some countries.\n\nVIEW + How Latin America\u2019s First Ever Stablecoin Could Trigger a Crypto Battle The Argentine cryptocurrency company Ripio announced that it has launched what is considered the first Latin American stablecoin, called \"Criptodolar\", what are the implications?\n\nAccording to information published by crypto data aggregator Coingecko regarding how much money has to be spent mining to obtain a bitcoin in different global locations.\n\nCoingecko estimates that a lone miner needs an average of 266,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity to mine a single bitcoin. This process would take approximately seven years to complete, which would amount to a monthly electricity consumption of about 143 kWh. From this, it took the cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for each country (using global oil prices as a source, with prices updated to December 2022) to estimate how much it costs to mine this cryptocurrency.\n\nVIEW + US Probes Puerto Rico Tax Breaks That Lured Crypto Traders, Fund Managers The controversial tax breaks are designed to bring wealthy Americans to a US territory fresh out of bankruptcy and where more than 40% of residents live in poverty\n\nIn which countries is it profitable to mine bitcoin?\n\nTo August 23, 2023, one bitcoin cost $26,592. In which countries of Latin America is it possible to mine below that price?\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\nCuba: $7,989\n\n$7,989 Argentina : $9,040\n\n: $9,040 Venezuela : $12,240\n\n: $12,240 Paraguay: $14,630\n\nThe margin is so high that, even with price readjustments, it is most likely that with bitcoin close to $27,000 in all these countries home mining will continue to be profitable.\n\nIn Mexico, for example, the price of energy ($26,340 to mine a bitcoin) is practically at the same value as the cost of mining, so it would not make sense to do so, unless there is a significant rise in the price of the cryptocurrency. Something similar occurs in Ecuador ($25,540 per bitcoin mined).\n\nHow much electricity is needed to mine 1 Bitcoin?\n\n\n\nAs a solo miner, an average of 266,000 kWh of electricity is required to mine a 1 $BTC. This process spans about 7 years, with a monthly electricity consumption of around 143 kWh.\n\n\n\nRead the full study: https://t.co/J0zATdjsb1 pic.twitter.com/XiaFwHispF \u2014 CoinGecko (@coingecko) August 23, 2023\n\nIn contrast, in Uruguay energy costs mean each bitcoin would cost $67,300 to mine, meaning that it would make no sense to do so unless the crypto currency returns to its all-time high.\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\nHow much would it cost to mine bitcoin in other Latin American countries?\n\nChile : $49,210\n\n: $49,210 Colombia : $47,610\n\n: $47,610 Brazil : $45,490\n\n: $45,490 Dominican Republic: $32,720\n\nThe world\u2019s cheapest countries for bitcoin mining\n\nWhile energy subsidies in some Latin American countries make mining profitable, nothing compares to Lebanon, where mining one bitcoin can cost as little as $266.02, according to Coingecko\u2019s data.\n\nIn Iran, too, it is a profitable business, as the cost of energy makes mining the most popular crypto unit cost $532.04.\n\nIn Syria it would cost $1,330.10, with the following countries also profitable markets for mining:\n\nEthiopia: $1,596.12\n\nSudan: $2,128.17\n\nLibya: $2,660.21\n\nKyrgyzstan: $2,660.21\n\nAngola: $3,724.29\n\nZimbabwe: $3,990.31\n\nBhutan: $4,256.33"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes the Federal Reserve will lose its quest to beat inflation, ultimately benefiting \u201crisk assets of finite supply,\u201d such as Bitcoin.\n\nIn a blog post published on Wednesday, the essayist argued that the Fed is sucking money from one area of the economy while injecting money into another.\n\nAs long as the Fed\u2019s strategy to combat inflation remains \u201cquixotic,\u201d assets like Bitcoin will likely rise in the long run.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBitcoin has a finite supply, and therefore as the denominator of fiat toilet paper grows, so will Bitcoin\u2019s value in fiat currency terms,\u201d Hayes wrote. Aside from big tech and crypto, the ex-CEO believes nothing will yield a better return for investors besides parking their money at Fed and earning nearly 6% yield.\n\nHe went on to explain why the Fed\u2019s tactics have been flawed.\n\nSpecifically, by continually raising its Reverse Repo Program (RRP) and Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB), the central bank is forced to pay out billions more per month to depositors, which counteracts the Fed\u2019s effect on the money supply from quantitative tightening (QT; selling bonds on the open market).\n\n\u201cIf the Fed believes that to kill inflation it must both raise interest rates and reduce the size of its balance sheet, then it is cutting its nose to spite its face,\u201d wrote Hayes.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s approach differs from Paul Volcker \u2013 a former central bank chairman credited with crushing inflation in the 1980s through hawkish monetary policy. As Hayes explained, while the Fed in the 1980s may have adjusted its policy rate, it did not micromanage RRP and IORB rates to match it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe only variable that changed from the Fed\u2019s perspective was the size of its balance sheet,\u201d said Hayes.\n\nAt present, the Fed is draining $80 billion per month from the market through QT, while injecting $22.53 billion into banks. Though this still appears \u201crestrictive,\u201d Hayes estimated that the rising interest expense on U.S. government debt is putting another $80 billion per month back into the economy. \u201cI estimate that ~$23 billion in liquidity is net injected every month,\u201d he said.\n\nEventually, Hayes said he expects the Fed to reverse course on QT as the U.S. Treasury becomes replete with alternative buyers of its debt, and grows desperate to avoid a cataclysmic default. That said, the market doesn\u2019t seem to acknowledge this as imminent, and thus hasn't moved its capital into Bitcoin \u2013 yet.\n\n\u201cWe gotta go down to go up,\u201d concluded Hayes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to fight the market, but just sit tight and accept my stimmies.\u201d"

        "content": "Empowered Funds is seeking to launch three bitcoin futures ETFs using the ARK Invest Management and 21Shares brands, as firms look to tap into investor demand for cryptocurrency products.\n\nEmpowered is a subsidiary of Alpha Architect, which offers 15 ETFs with nearly $1.9 billion in assets. The firm filed to issue the exchange-traded funds with the SEC earlier this month and will be the advisor to the funds. 21Shares and ARK, which have teamed up on other bitcoin ETF applications, will perform subadvisor roles.\n\nFirms like BlackRock Inc., Fidelity, and Invesco have been rushing to roll out digital asset ETF products as the Securities and Exchange Commission faces mounting pressure to greenlight an array of cryptocurrency funds. The Empowered fund filings come as a slew of firms, including ARK and 21Shares, await approval for a spot bitcoin ETF. Empowered is seeking to launch ETFs that track bitcoin futures contracts, as opposed to spot ETFs that track physical bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin ETFs on the Horizon\n\nThe ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Futures ETF will invest in bitcoin futures contracts and serve as the underlying fund for the other two products set to launch. The ARK 21Shares Active On-Chain Bitcoin Strategy ETF will allocate at least 25% of its assets in its Digital Asset and Blockchain Strategy ETF. The third ETF, the ARK 21Shares Digital Asset and Blockchain Strategy ETF, will also invest in the Active Bitcoin Futures ETF. The funds can also invest in Treasury securities, according to their prospectus.\n\nWhile investors are anticipating a spot bitcoin decision, other firms are taking advantage of increased interest in the space to launch new products. The first and largest futures bitcoin fund is the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which has $955 million in assets.\n\nProShares saw significant first-mover benefits by being the first to launch a bitcoin futures ETF, seeing millions in deposits on the first day it hit the market. Some speculate the SEC will approve multiple spot bitcoins at once to avoid one firm getting the vast majority of market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "title": "Hacking Incidents Shake the Crypto World: How Bitcoin Stands Strong - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency landscape has captured the imagination of individuals and institutions all around the world, with its promise of decentralized finance and safe transactions. However, recent hacking instances have raised concerns about the security of digital assets.\n\nIn the face of these problems, Bitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, holds firm, demonstrating resilience and providing vital lessons on security, innovation, and the future of digital money. We look at the impact of hacking attacks on the crypto world, investigate how Bitcoin remains strong, and reveal the metrics that demonstrate its resilience in a fast expanding digital era.\n\nThe Cryptocurrency Security Paradox\n\nSecurity Concerns in the Crypto Landscape\n\nThe attractiveness of cryptocurrencies arises from their potential to reshape financial systems by removing geographical restrictions and intermediaries. However, because these assets are digital, they are subject to cyberattacks. Recent high-profile hacking instances have sounded the alarm, emphasizing the critical necessity for effective security measures inside the crypto ecosystem.\n\nCrypto Hacks and Losses: Second Quarter 2023 Insights\n\nThe digital realm of cryptocurrencies faced another quarter of turmoil, as revealed by CertiK's quarterly report on blockchain security. More than $300 million in digital assets fell victim to crypto hacks and exploits in the second quarter of 2023, based on on-chain data compiled by the blockchain security company.\n\nThe report highlighted 212 security incidents during the quarter, resulting in a staggering $313,566,528 drained from Web3 protocols by malicious actors. Despite this concerning trend, there was a noticeable 58% decline in losses compared to the same period in 2022 when $745 million was lost to hacks and exploits.\n\nHowever, the quarter also witnessed some shifting dynamics. Exit scams saw a striking surge, contributing to almost $70 million in losses, almost doubling the losses incurred from similar scams in the previous quarter, which amounted to around $31 million.\n\nInterestingly, flash loans and oracle manipulation exploits experienced a sharp drop in the second quarter, contrasting their significant presence in the first quarter of 2023. The first quarter recorded 52 oracle manipulation attacks, resulting in approximately $222 million in losses. Notably, the Euler Finance hack constituted a substantial 85% of these losses. In the second quarter, the figures declined drastically, with 54 flash loan and oracle manipulation attacks leading to approximately $23 million in losses, marking an 89% reduction from the previous quarter.\n\nBitcoin's Persistence\n\nDespite these obstacles, Bitcoin remains a testimony to the potential resiliency of digital currencies. How has Bitcoin survived the assault of hacking attacks and market volatility? Let us look at some of the aspects that contribute to Bitcoin's strength:\n\nThe Immutability of the Blockchain: Bitcoin is built on the blockchain, a decentralized and immutable database that records transactions. Once a transaction has been added to the blockchain, it is nearly hard to change or reverse it. This immutability gives an additional degree of security, lowering the possibility of fraudulent activity. Decentralization: Because Bitcoin is decentralized, no single entity has complete control over the network. When compared to centralized databases that are vulnerable to single points of failure, this distributed structure makes it more difficult for hackers to infiltrate the entire system. Work Proof Consensus: Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism forces miners to solve challenging mathematical problems in order to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. Because this procedure necessitates a large amount of processing power and energy, bad actors will find it difficult to influence the network. Strong Cryptography: To secure transactions and wallets, Bitcoin employs complex cryptographic techniques. Private keys and digital signatures guarantee secure authentication, making illegal access extremely difficult. Community Vigilance: When it comes to security issues, the Bitcoin community is extremely watchful. Constant monitoring, peer-reviewed code, and collaborative efforts to address vulnerabilities all contribute to the network's ongoing security. Mt. Gox and Beyond: Lessons from the Past: Bitcoin's resilience is based on lessons learnt from previous incidents. Mt. Gox, one of the first and largest Bitcoin exchanges, went bankrupt, emphasizing the significance of secure custody solutions and regulatory compliance. Since then, the sector has matured, with exchanges and custodians adding strict security procedures.\n\nThe Big Picture: The Evolution of the Crypto Ecosystem\n\nWhile Bitcoin's robustness is admirable, the hacking episodes reveal bigger issues and potential in the crypto ecosystem:\n\nSecurity Innovations: Hacking incidences inspire the creation of novel security solutions. The industry is investing in solutions that improve user protection, including as multi-signature wallets, hardware wallets, and secure custody services. Regulatory Implications: The developing regulatory landscape seeks to achieve a balance between encouraging innovation and protecting consumers. Regulation can play a critical role in protecting investors and discouraging bad behaviour. Education and Awareness: It is critical to educate users. Individuals must comprehend the significance of secure behaviors such as choosing strong passwords, activating two-factor authentication, and being wary of phishing attempts. Technological Evolution: The crypto ecosystem is constantly evolving. To address known vulnerabilities, new consensus mechanisms, privacy upgrades, and scalability solutions are being developed. Collaboration for a Safer Future: Hacking incidents highlight the importance of collaboration among developers, exchanges, regulators, and users. Collective vigilance is required for the development of a secure and sustainable crypto environment.\n\nConclusion: How to Navigate the Crypto Landscape\n\nRecent hacking incidents in the crypto industry serve as a sharp reminder of the difficulties inherent in the digital financial arena. Despite the chaos, Bitcoin's tenacity shines as a beacon of optimism and opportunity. Its core principles of decentralization, immutability of the blockchain, and cryptographic security provide vital insights for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nThe lessons learned from these occurrences will impact the future of digital money as the crypto ecosystem evolves. While obstacles continue, they also spur innovation, collaboration, and a renewed dedication to secure procedures. The crypto community can pave the road for a safer, more resilient, and revolutionary financial future by embracing lessons learnt and aiming for continual progress."

        "content": "Many stakeholders in the crypto industry have welcomed the idea of traditional finance firms offering a Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) as they believe it will further drive crypto adoption. However, the former CEO and co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, Arthur Hayes, seems to be against the move.\n\nProblems With BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF Filing\n\nIn a post published on his Substack platform, Hayes made his displeasure known regarding the recent wave of Spot Bitcoin ETF applications by prominent traditional financial (TradFi) institutions, including BlackRock.\n\nContrary to public opinion, he doesn\u2019t believe these TradFi institutions are bullish on crypto. Instead, they are moving to become \u201ccrypto gatekeepers\u201d to balance their deposit base, explaining that these companies intend to offer ETFs or any similar investment product with crypto as its underlying asset to achieve this.\n\nHe stated that since these fund managers will be the \u201conly game in town,\u201d they can charge investors enormous fees in exchange for their investment products.\n\nAccording to him, institutions like BlackRock recognize that cryptocurrencies can be used to hedge against inflation and could have a significant impact on the economy going forward. So they want to have it \u201cunder their control\u201d when that happens.\n\nHe believes the only times these firms have done a \u201cgood job\u201d is to paint the crypto industry and cryptocurrencies in a bad light to the government. As such, they will have a hard time changing the narrative to circumvent the federal government\u2019s proposed inflation tax on bank depositors.\n\nThe Bitmex founder suggested that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) clampdown on the crypto industry was never about the technology itself but who owned it.\n\nHe believes those who had earlier tried to get a Bitcoin ETF approved faced disapproval based on their status. However, the regulator seems more welcoming to the idea because of the prestige of BlackRock and its CEO, Larry Fink.\n\nBTC price falls to $26,300 territory | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nTradFi Doesn\u2019t Care About Decentralization\n\nHayes noted that the banks and financial regulators could collaborate to uphold the dollar\u2019s sovereignty. According to him, this can be easily achieved by both parties agreeing to ensure that all crypto redemptions are made in the US dollar and not the \u201cphysical crypto\u201d itself.\n\nThese US dollars will then be put back into the banking system, which he believes is already compromised.\n\nHayes is more concerned that all this goes against Satoshi\u2019s vision of creating a decentralized financial system and he believes BlackRock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink doesn\u2019t care about decentralization.\n\nHe highlighted that Fink and BlackRock\u2019s business model is built on centralization, adding that asset managers like BlackRock do not add value to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, such as increased privacy or censorship resistance.\n\nInstead, these asset managers moving to offer ETFs means they have more control over large voting blocks and can affect governance decisions.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The surging yield on U.S. government bonds would benefit cryptos in the long term, as per Hayes.\n\nHe said that growing TradFi interest could be detrimental to the core ethos of cryptos, like decentralization.\n\nArthur Hayes, founder of cryptocurrency exchange BitMeX, offered a refreshing take on the ongoing state of the crypto market.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nIn a lengthy Substack essay, the American entrepreneur predicted that Bitcoin [BTC] won\u2019t drop below $20,000 as feared by a big chunk of traders and analysts in the sphere. Instead, he projected that the king coin will wobble around the $25,000-mark throughout the third quarter of 2023.\n\nHigher U.S. debt yields good for cryptos?\n\nHayes, one of the keen observers of the crypto market and the U.S. macroeconomy, based his prediction going against the conventional understanding around yields on government debt.\n\nExperts cited increasing yields on U.S. treasury bands as one of the major factors behind last week\u2019s market crash. This was based on the theory that higher yields on risk-free government debt generally harms demand for speculative assets like stocks and cryptos.\n\nArthur Hayes, on the contrary, opined that this situation augured well for riskier assets in the long term. He said,\n\n\u201cI also believe that at some point, more investors will do the Maths and realize that the Fed and U.S. Treasury combined are handing out billions per month to wealthy savers. This money has to go somewhere, and some of it will flow into tech stocks and crypto.\u201d\n\nSpot ETFs a threat to decentralization?\n\nApart from the market\u2019s next moves, Hayes weighed in on the institutional interest around cryptos, seen in the barrage of spot ETF applications in recent months.\n\nHe issued a warning, stating that the increased interest shown by TradFi would eventually harm the core tenets of cryptos and blockchains. The entrepreneur said that these entities don\u2019t have any interest in enhancing or even preserving Web3-specific ideals like decentralization, privacy, and censorship-resistance.\n\nFurthermore, he predicted a restriction in in-kind redemptions of crypto financial products in the future, provided the applications are approved. This basically meant that holders would no longer be able to redeem actual crypto and would have to settle for redemptions exclusively in U.S. Dollars.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nIn a nutshell, Arthur Hayes\u2019 prediction about cryptocurrencies in general proved to be a mixed bag. While he downplayed the ramifications of certain macroeconomic events, the supposed threat to the much-cherished fundamentals could make maximalists nervous.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin exchanged hands at $26,400, nearly 2% up in the last 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap."

Let\u2019s dive deep into the intricacies of Bitcoin halving and explore the exciting realm of ApeMax.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Halving?\n\nBitcoin halving is a blockchain event that occurs roughly every four years, where the rewards miners receive for confirming and adding new transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain are halved. This mechanism was introduced by Bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, as a means of ensuring that the cryptocurrency remained deflationary. By the year 2140, all 21 million Bitcoin will have been mined. Given that nearly 89% of all Bitcoin has already been mined, these halving events are seen by some as crucial in prolonging the mining lifespan of Bitcoin and controlling its supply.\n\nWhat is ApeMax?\n\nAmidst this backdrop of the Bitcoin ecosystem, a new entrant has emerged in the crypto world \u2013 ApeMax. While Bitcoin halvings have dominated conversations in recent years, new tokens like ApeMax are gaining attention for their innovative approach. ApeMax, the latest sensation in the meme coin universe, stands out with its mascot, Max the Ape. Beyond its playful facade, ApeMax holders can enjoy features whereby they can earn rewards in a fun way.\n\nThe ApeMax presale is an event that crypto enthusiasts should keenly observe. During this phase, eligible early bird buyers get the opportunity to purchase ApeMax tokens at presale prices, with the chance to access the Early Birds Loot Boxes for discounts. But ApeMax\u2019s allure doesn\u2019t stop there. Its \u2018Boost to Earn\u2019 staking approach allows coin holders to boost entities they are passionate about while earning ApeMax tokens. Moreover, ApeMax emphasizes security, using audited smart contracts and offering immediate self-custody of purchased coins. This means holders can stake their tokens without delay, even during the presale phase.\n\nAs the crypto world anticipates the next Bitcoin halving, projects like ApeMax are alternative crypto opportunities with new types of innovation. While Bitcoin remains a significant player, the diverse world of cryptocurrencies offers various new opportunities, with ApeMax being one to watch.\n\nWhen is the Next Bitcoin Halving Event?\n\nThe last Bitcoin halving occurred in 2020, reducing the miner reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. The next halving event is expected around April 2024, further cutting down the reward to 3.125 BTC. This reduction in rewards, in tandem with rising operational costs, will require miners to reassess their strategies and become more efficient.\n\nHow will Bitcoin Halving Affect BTC Price?\n\nHistorically, some past Bitcoin halvings have triggered or coincided with a bull run in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. This is primarily attributed to the decreased supply and increased demand. But it\u2019s also worth noting that while Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate decreases with each halving, its actual impact on price can be influenced by a myriad of other factors including technological advancements, adoption rates, and global economic factors. While past performance can be studied, the future of Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies remains unpredictable.\n\nDelving into the world of cryptocurrencies necessitates meticulous research. The realm of crypto is characterized by its unpredictability and significant price fluctuations. It\u2019s imperative to remain informed, consult with impartial financial experts, and brace yourself for and understand the inherent risks present in all cryptocurrencies. For prospective ApeMax buyers, please be aware that it\u2019s not accessible for purchase in certain regions. Ineligible countries include the USA, Canada, and other specific zones. Always check the ApeMax website to confirm eligibility based on your region before proceeding with any purchase.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "From 'Rich Dad' to Crypto Prophet: Kiyosaki Sees Bitcoin at $1M! InQubeta Presale Targets $10M Raise - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "InQubeta (QUBE) has emerged as the top crypto to buy as its presale raises over $2.2 million and sets investors up to grow their capital by up to 4x depending on how early they join the action. The QUBE presale is currently one of the most promising events in the cryptocurrency space as altcoin prices tank across the board.\n\nSome crypto analysts are already comparing InQubeta\u2019s growth potential to Bitcoin (BTC) due to factors like its 1.5 billion token cap and deflationary protocols that reduce the supply further. $QUBE, the blockchain\u2019s native tokens, are currently selling for around a penny, but prices will jump to over 3 cents by the time the presale ends. $QUBE tokens have the potential to be worth a few dollars in the next few years, giving it comparable growth potential to Bitcoin.\n\nRich Dad Robert Kiyosaki has been an open proponent of cryptocurrencies and he recently predicted Bitcoin prices have the potential to reach $1 million if global markets collapse. \u201cIf stock & bond markets crash, gold & silver skyrocket,\u201d Kiyosaki tweeted. \u201cWorse news: If the world economy crashes, bitcoin [will rise to] $1 million, gold $75K, [and] silver to $60K.\u201d\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) emerges as the best crypto to invest in as presale exceeds previous projections\n\nThe InQubeta presale is one of the few opportunities in the crypto space right now that allows investors who join now to increase their capital 3x before it ends. It\u2019s emerged as a rallying point for cryptocurrency investors looking to recoup some of their losses as markets crash.\n\nInQubeta hopes to push advancements in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry by opening up investments to global investments. It\u2019s an alternative to traditional investment avenues and their often demanding entry barriers like minimum investments that are more than the typical worker in the U.S. makes in a year.\n\nThanks to the QUBE project, all those who want to invest in AI and enjoy the profits that come with doing so only need a cryptocurrency wallet to join the action.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s innovative approach to investing sets it up for success as artificial intelligence grows at a rapid rate. Investments in AI have grown 10x from 2015 and have now reached over $120 billion. Investments in AI are expected to keep growing exponentially and over $1.5 trillion is expected to be invested in AI firms over the next few years.\n\nCreating a better investment channel with ERC20 coins and blockchain technology\n\nAI startups can generate capital to advance their projects on the QUBE ecosystem by creating and selling equity-based ERC20 coins on InQubeta\u2019s Ethereum-based blockchain. Each non-fungible token (NFT) is reviewed by the operations team before being listed on the NFT marketplace.\n\nThe marketplace is where investors review the different NFTs on the ERC20 token list and research the companies behind them. Tokens can be purchased with $QUBE, giving investors full ownership. Like stocks, the value of these NFTs will grow as their makers grow. Some also come with extra benefits like a slice of profits or discounted products and services.\n\nKiyosaki predicts struggling global markets will be beneficial for Bitcoin (BTC) price growth\n\nRobert Kiyosaki isn\u2019t the first person to predict Bitcoin prices will someday surpass a million dollars and he makes a strong argument. Bitcoin prices have historically risen during periods of market uncertainty while growth often slows down when markets are thriving. Kiyosaki advises investors to hedge against uncertainty by buying gold, silver, and Bitcoin.\n\nAs impressive as Bitcoin prices reaching a million is, it doesn\u2019t match InQubeta projected 100x growth in 2023.\n\nSummary\n\nInQubeta has emerged as a top altcoin to invest in by providing an easier way for investors to partner up with AI firms and enjoy substantial profits as the tech transforms the world. Very few cryptocurrencies will be able to keep up with $QUBE in the next several years.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Africa's Bitcoin community remains positive on its potential - TechCabal",
        "content": "Bitcoin, as well as other crypto, has had a wild run in the past year. In the face of this, however, the African Bitcoin community has remained unfazed.\n\nAnita Posch is a digital nomad who has spent the past two years travelling Africa as a Bitcoin educator and teaches Bitcoin at grassroots levels. For Posch, who started a learning platform titled Crack The Orange, Bitcoin has one goal; facilitating a more just financial system. She believes in the potential of Bitcoin as an equaliser, giving people across the world access to the same monetary system and is committing a lot of time and effort to that gospel.\n\nOn Thursday, August 18, 2023, Bitcoin hit a new low as it fell over 8% to rest at $26,172, its biggest one-day drop since FTX collapsed in November 2022. Hundreds of thousands of traders liquidated about $500 million worth of the digital currency in 24 hours amid rumours that Space X had sold off all the Bitcoin they were holding.\n\nThe past year has been a wild ride for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The collapse of FTX triggered a lot of speculation around the legitimacy and fate of crypto, with investors liquidating their remaining assets and startups folding in the face of loss and limited capital. All of these sent the prices of digital assets plummeting, as the price of Bitcoin fell 22% percent in a day. The asset has since regained its losses since then.\n\nIn 2022, I spoke to a number of Bitcoin maximalists working on Bitcoin-related projects across the continent. There were a lot of elaborate plans on what Bitcoin could do for Africa, including plans for a Bitcoin village in Lagos, and Machankura, a custodial wallet that allows people to send and receive Bitcoin via USSD codes. One year and multiple scandals later, Bitcoiners still believe that real Bitcoin has largely been unaffected.\n\nAccording to Posch, who is currently in Zambia, people who really understand Bitcoin aren\u2019t bothered by the price fluctuation and donations to her non-profit haven\u2019t really been affected.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is not a game for you to win quick, free money, and that is the mentality we are working to combat. Sometimes people are short-sighted, and understandably so, because they need money and they need it fast, which is what causes a lot of the problems we keep hearing about. The goal of many people using Bitcoin is to save for the long term, and going by that, Bitcoin is the best currency to do that with. You might say the dollar or pound are better but even those currencies are currently being racked by inflation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ensure that we tell people in our communities to only invest money for the long-term and not the one they need immediately. Don\u2019t risk all your money just because you\u2019re looking for quick returns. Bitcoin has a lot of functionality, but it is not a get-rich-quick scheme,\u201d she shared.\n\nAnita Posch at a Bitcoin workshop\n\nPosch\u2019s Bitcoin platform, Crack The Orange, teaches people about the complexities of Bitcoin and its uses. For her, it is crucial at this stage where there are a lot of wrong assumptions about the currency and a lot of ignorance surrounding its potential.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked on Bitcoin education and have reached hundreds of people. However, the point of this is to build something that\u2019s long-lasting and sustainable because there\u2019s only so much that I can do. I\u2019m doing this so that people from these communities can learn themselves even when I\u2019m not there, and even teach others. There are a lot of opportunities for people who understand Bitcoin out there and my goal is to get people enlightened and possibly plugged into these opportunities.\u201d\n\nAll across Africa, there are people like Posch, who still believe in the power of Bitcoin, regardless of the scandals and fluctuations in price. Abubakar Nur Khalil, CEO of Bitcoin VC firm, Recursive Capital is one of such people. According to Khalil, a big mistake that the Bitcoin community made was allowing themselves to be lumped into a broader crypto industry.\n\n\u201cThis kind of framing harms people, as they are often unfamiliar with the technicalities behind how projects, including Bitcoin, work and their differences, which encourages misinformation. This misinformation puts unsuspecting people on a path of becoming bankrupt, ultimately disillusioned with the space, uninterested in any legitimate benefits of Bitcoin, and only poisons the well,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAccording to them, their operations as a Bitcoin organisation have continued per usual despite everything that has happened. In his article, Khalil shared that there has even been a significant increase in the quality of projects that come through their pipeline. \u201cPreviously, the messaging of \u2018crypto VC\u2019 only filled our inbox with projects that were either outright scams, well-dressed yet-to-be-uncovered scams, or impractical ideas.\u201d\n\nFor years now, Bitcoin maximalists have insisted on a large difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, asserting that Bitcoin is the only digital currency worth paying attention to. In this article from the Bitcoin Magazine, Jimmy Song writes that \u201cBitcoin is the original and very different from \u2018crypto\u2019 projects, which are all basically cheap knockoffs. Bitcoin has no central controller, there aren\u2019t misaligned incentives, the people involved have no special rights and there\u2019s no marketing team.\u201d According to Bitcoiners, it is this difference that will make Bitcoin stand the test of time and continue to operate even while the price is shaky.\n\nFor Heritage Falodun, the founder of the Bitcoin advocacy community, DigiOats, they\u2019ve been working extra hard to shift the interest in Bitcoin beyond being an investment with the possibility of high returns to its other functionalities like facilitating financial innovation. According to Falodun, the bubble of crypto has burst and a lot more people are open-eyed and more critical of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cWe have to teach people how to protect themselves from centralised exchanges in terms of creating private keys to store their Bitcoin. These days, it is not enough to just tell people revolutionary objectives or theories like \u2018Bitcoin has the potential to change lives\u2019, you have to show them how and give realistic, practical examples. Bitcoin advocacy now involves doing the actual work, and although the adoption rates have slowed due to all the recent happenings\u2014 including the forex exchange rates, we\u2019re doing the work to advocate for more innovation as opposed to only ways people can make a profit,\u201d he shared with TechCabal.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology is truly innovative and has become a game-changer in the finance world, a considerable amount of interest in the currency stemmed from its potential to yield high returns as quickly as possible and its promise of decentralisation. In the past year, a lot of faith and interest in Bitcoin has waned, and this shift in public perception will undoubtedly affect what Bitcoin advocacy on the continent looks like in the future.\n\nHave you got your tickets to TechCabal\u2019s Moonshot Conference?

        "content": "In recent weeks, Bitcoin (BTC) has encountered a formidable downturn, with its value receding to approximately $26,000. This comes barely a month after the cryptocurrency tantalizingly grazed the $30,000 milestone.\n\nThe journey downhill can be attributed to a blend of factors, encompassing dwindling market participation, the absence of significant advancements concerning the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), and rare reports indicating that SpaceX, helmed by Elon Musk, reduced its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nSeeking further insights regarding BTC\u2019s future price trajectory, Finbold consulted with Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) artificial intelligence (AI) bot, Google Bard, on August 25.\n\nNotably, we asked Bard to predict how much Bitcoin\u2019s price will fall in 2023, and outline key factors that could make a notable impact on its price action.\n\nBard\u2019s response\n\nFirstly, Google Bard stressed that the direction of Bitcoin\u2019s price in the coming months is uncertain because it depends on a high number of factors. In addition, Bitcoin is still a volatile asset, the chatbot noted, meaning it can undergo sharp price changes in a brief period of time.\n\nNevertheless, Bard predicted that the average lowest price Bitcoin could hit in 2023 is $20,759, citing an analysis of multiple financial experts. The consensus projection is based on the lowest estimates of $12,000 and the highest of $30,000, Bard noted.\n\n\u201cAccording to the experts I have researched, the average lowest price that they think Bitcoin will reach by year-end 2023 is US$20,759. Some are more bearish and believe it could drop as low as US$12,000. However, there are also some experts who are more bullish and believe that Bitcoin could reach US$30,000 or even higher by the end of the year.\u201d \u2013 Bard said in its response.\n\nMeanwhile, at press time, BTC was changing hands at $26,099, down 1.4% on the day. The maiden crypto asset gained less than 1% over the past week while losing more than 10% on the month.\n\nFactors that could influence BTC price\n\nIn its extensive response, Bard said there is a combination of factors that could influence Bitcoin\u2019s price in 2023, both positively and negatively.\n\nNotably, the chatbot highlighted that Bitcoin has been in a bear market since late 2021, and it is possible that the market could continue experiencing a downturn in the coming months.\n\nSome of the factors that could contribute to this scenario are sticky inflation drivers, which could force the US Federal Reserve to continue hiking interest rates, even after bringing them to the highest level in more than 20 years.\n\nAdditionally, increased regulatory scrutiny could also have an adverse impact on crypto prices, Bard noted.\n\n\u201cThis could make it more difficult for people to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and could also lead to a decline in their price.\u201d \u2013 Bard added.\n\nOn a positive note, the AI bot outlined several potential catalysts for Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory throughout the remainder of 2023.\n\n\n\nThese include increased adoptions by major institutions such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and MicroStrategy, as well as growing institutional adoption that could be fueled by the launch of a new Bitcoin ETF.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Post-Bitcoin Halving: Crypto Fund Sets $148,000 Price Target - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "In a recent deep dive into Bitcoin\u2019s historical performance and future potential, Pantera Capital, the fifth-largest crypto hedge fund by AUM, has projected a staggering $148,000 price target for BTC post its next halving event.\n\nWhen Bitcoin Price Could Reach $150,000\n\nThe \u201cBlockchain Letter\u201d released by Pantera Capital meticulously analyzes BTC\u2019s past halving events and their subsequent impact on its price. The firm noted, \u201cBitcoin experienced the longest period of negative year-over-year returns in its history, lasting 15 months (2/8/22\u20136/12/23).\u201d Drawing parallels to the previous longest downturn, they added, \u201cThe longest period prior was just under a year (11/14/14\u201310/31/15).\u201d\n\nPantera\u2019s bullish sentiment is not solely based on historical data. The firm believes that recent positive developments in the crypto space, such as \u201cthe XRP ruling and endorsements by BlackRock et al.,\u201d combined with the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April 2024, create a potent mix for a potential bull market for digital assets. They stated, \u201cOur view is that we\u2019ve seen enough \u2013 there\u2019s just so long markets can be down.\u201d\n\nThe halving event, a pre-programmed reduction in the BTC block reward for miners, is a significant event in the Bitcoin ecosystem. As Pantera explains, \u201cEvery four years that \u2018block reward\u2019 is cut in half, thus it\u2019s referred to as \u2018the halving\u2019.\u201d This process is set to continue until 2140, ensuring that only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist. Citing Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Pantera quoted, \u201cTotal circulation will be 21,000,000 coins. It\u2019ll be distributed to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half every four years.\u201d\n\nDrawing from this, Pantera made a bold prediction: \u201cIF history were to repeat itself, the price of Bitcoin should have troughed December 30, 2022.\u201d The analysis further notes that the actual low was observed on November 9th, 2022, amid the FTX fiasco.\n\nThe upcoming halving, slated for April 20, 2024, will see the mining reward drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. Pantera\u2019s analysis suggests that even though the Efficient Markets Theory posits that such a well-known event should already be priced in, history paints a different picture.\n\nThey elaborated, \u201cBitcoin has historically bottomed 477 days prior to the halving, climbed leading into it, and then exploded to the upside afterwards.\u201d Furthermore, according to Pantera, the new cycle high will come 480 days after the halving, in July 2025.\n\nThe firm\u2019s stock-to-flow price projection model, which examines the change in the stock-to-flow ratio across each halving, has been instrumental in their analysis. They observed, \u201cThe 2016 halving decreased the supply of new Bitcoins only one-third as much as the first. Interestingly, it had exactly one-third the price impact.\u201d\n\nDrawing from these patterns, Pantera concludes, \u201cIf history were to repeat itself, the next halving would see Bitcoin rising to $35k before the halving and $148k after.\u201d\n\nThis projection aligns with other bullish forecasts in the Bitcoin space. Notably, Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee also recently predicted a $150,000 price point for BTC after the next halving. At press time, BTC traded at $26,537.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com"
