        "title": "This Bitcoin-themed bar in Mexico City is a hub for the crypto community. - Slate",
        "content": "It\u2019s 7 p.m. on a Thursday, and I\u2019m drinking a beer next to a Bitcoin ATM.\n\nOn the wall in front of me is an illustration of a masked Satoshi Nakamoto: \u201cDon\u2019t Delay\u2014Be Your Own Bank,\u201d it announces. It\u2019s one of several portraits of Satoshi, including one that features him taking off from a dollar bill as if he were a superhero. (The portraits are particularly creative, since no one knows who Satoshi\u2014a pseudonym\u2014really is.) A TV is mounted above the bar, displaying the current values of hundreds of cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin occupies the biggest space on the screen, followed by Ethereum and Binance Coin, and then other coins, many with squares so tiny that they\u2019re imperceptible. The numbers on the screen fluctuate steadily: A Bitcoin is worth $21,163.64, then $21,112.75, then $21,101.05. Behind me is a case full of Bitcoin memorabilia for sale: mugs, T-shirts, rings.\n\nThis is Bitcoin Embassy Bar, a hip two-story establishment in Mexico City\u2019s Roma Norte neighborhood. It\u2019s a place where you can use Bitcoin to pay for a hot doge (Doge Coind, Multidoge, or Dogechain, depending on your liking), or exchange pesos to reload your Bitcoin wallet. It also hopes to be a gathering place for the Bitcoin community in Latin America. As it does so, it weaves a sort of tension: creating a physical gathering space for a community that is, in its DNA, digital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLatin America is arguably the most important testing ground for building physical infrastructure and community around digital currencies\u2014from El Salvador to Puerto Rico to Guatemala. Depending on how you feel about crypto, this is either incredibly exciting or incredibly problematic. According to a report by Americas Society/Council of the Americas, the use of cryptocurrencies in Latin America rose 1,370 percent between 2019 and 2021. Mainstream adoption is still quite far away, but crypto proponents make big promises in the region: that a new, decentralized financial system could promote financial inclusion, combat corruption, and serve as a counterweight to hyperinflation. Still, those promises are hard to deliver on\u2014and, as in the case of El Salvador, those who pay the real price of failure are rarely the people with red lasers shooting out of their eyes on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLorena Ortiz, the cofounder and owner of Bitcoin Embassy Bar, first started investing in Bitcoin in 2017. She needed quick money for a trip to Japan\u2014her friend was producing a tour and invited her to go along. \u201cIt made total sense to me to have a tool that could help people break free of the failed system we live with,\u201d Ortiz, 33, said. Bitcoin was punk, and so was she. Around November, she started with a small investment of about $25 USD. In December, Bitcoin hit an all-time high. But Ortiz decided to forgo the trip to dedicate herself to her newfound crypto passion.*\n\nAt the beginning of 2018, Ortiz started talking with the bar\u2019s cofounder, David Noriega, about the need for a physical gathering space for Bitcoiners in Mexico City. Noriega brought the technical Bitcoin experience, and Ortiz knew how to run a restaurant. The bar opened its doors in December of that year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Ortiz told me, the business has grown mostly through word-of-mouth. There are ups and downs: During bull markets, she said, the yet unconverted often wander in with questions about Bitcoin. During bear markets, most of Ortiz\u2019s customers are more dedicated Bitcoiners, who attend frequent meet-ups and share tips. Shortly after our interview, the bar\u2019s second floor welcomed 20 or so Bitcoiners for one such meet-up about myths in Bitcoin, led by a Colombian crypto influencer. During meet-ups, up to 50 percent of customers pay the tab in Bitcoin, Ortiz said, but that drops down to 10 or 20 percent when there isn\u2019t an event. Plastered around the bar are print-outs with tips to avoid crypto scams\u2014and this, Ortiz tells me, is one of her core goals: to create a space where people can learn and ask questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin Embassy Bar isn\u2019t the first business of its kind: There\u2019s a coffee shop in Prague, a bar in Manhattan, and a burger joint in L.A. that follow similar models. This makes sense, because for its core believers, Bitcoin is \u201cnot an investment but an ideology,\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s worth remembering that the community that\u2019s formed around said ideology includes many documented cases of misogyny, racism, harassment, extremism, antisemitism, conspiracy, and outright scams. The crypto community is often hostile to outsiders or critics, and online crypto discourse is known for its toxicity\u2014it\u2019s hard to imagine \u201ccrypto bro\u201d culture is a culture worth replicating. But while it\u2019s important to acknowledge the more pernicious elements of this ecosystem, it\u2019s also not necessarily fair to use the loudest, most problematic voices to generalize about such a large group of people. A recent Pew survey found that 16 percent of U.S. adults have invested in, traded, or used a cryptocurrency. And among this community, gathering spaces and meet-ups are foundational. \u201cAll revolutions, all social movements, all of these kinds of systemic disruptions wouldn\u2019t have been possible if a small minority hadn\u2019t started to grow, grow, grow through community,\u201d Ortiz told me. In Latin America, she continued, \u201cwe have a deeply rooted tradition of making community \u2026 in person.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMexico\u2019s crypto ecosystem has grown since the bar opened\u2014four years in Bitcoin is equivalent to 20 normal years, Ortiz says. In May 2021, Mexico-based Bitso, a cryptocurrency exchange, became Latin America\u2019s first cryptocurrency unicorn, and in December of that year, the department store Elektra announced it would accept Bitcoin for online sales. Billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the (very!) controversial chairman of Grupo Elektra, is probably the country\u2019s most influential Bitcoin proponent\u2014in June 2021, he announced that Banco Azteca, which he also leads, would endeavor to become the first Mexican bank to accept Bitcoin. (Mexican regulators quickly shot this suggestion down.) In 2022, Salinas Pliego announced that 60 percent of his liquid portfolio was in Bitcoin or Bitcoin equities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSalinas Pliego was a topic of conversation at the first meet-up I attended at Bitcoin Embassy Bar, which featured a lawyer, a consultant, and an economics professor debating whether Bitcoin could\u2014and should\u2014be regulated. Salinas Pliego has a longstanding relationship with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and an attendee wanted to know whether he might be able to convert the president into a Bitcoiner. (The consensus: no.)\n\nThat night\u2019s conversation lasted about an hour and a half, during which the attendees collectively rolled their eyes at Sam Bankman-Fried for dirtying crypto\u2019s reputation and used their iPhones to flip between Instagram, Twitter, and Bitcoin wallets. A Brit who recently moved to Mexico tried to get me to open a Bitcoin wallet right then and there (I don\u2019t own crypto), and a Mexican who worked at a crypto start-up asked what I, as a newcomer, thought were the biggest advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin. Someone at the table next to me, I noticed, had a Sharpie rendering of the Bitcoin logo drawn on their thumbnail. The wall in front of us held a neon sign that read Eat Sleep Crypto Repeat and a large chalkboard with an illustration of an alien ship, complete with the caption We\u2019re going to the moon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the moon, it turns out, is still pretty far away. As I reported this story, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about a tweet Ortiz posted in early January: One of the city pipes connected to the restaurant was broken, and the restaurant, as a result, was having problems with leaking wastewater. They hadn\u2019t been able to get local authorities to do anything for the past month, and were hoping their followers could help up the pressure on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis struck me as the perfect representation of what it\u2019s like to run a Bitcoin bar: You can spend all the time you want talking about a decentralized, digital, financially autonomous future. But at the end of the day, you\u2019re still stuck with clunky government bureaucracy and sewer water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked Ortiz about this, she laughed. It\u2019s a familiar sensation: Every time she goes to the bank, has to knock on the door of government officials, or juggles headaches like the drainage issue, \u201cIt\u2019s like coming back to Earth: \u2018Hey, Lore, don\u2019t fly away. This is your reality,\u2019 \u201d she told me. She treats it as a lesson. \u201cBecause at the end of the day, you have to know where you\u2019re standing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some stories from the recent past of Future Tense.\n\nFuture Tense Fiction\n\nJanuary\u2019s story was \u201cBigfeet\u201d by Future Tense editor Torie Bosch. Written as if it were a New Yorker-esque article, Bosch\u2019s brilliant fiction debut chronicles a billionaire\u2019s revenge-driven quest to \u201cde-extinct\u201d a bigfoot-like creature. The story is largely told from the perspective of Dr. Shelley, one of the researchers who, sequestered on a distant island, helped combine ape, cow, and bear DNA to create Bigfeet: docile, bipedal creatures that look like \u201ca bizarro A.I. rendering of the traditional Bigfoot,\u201d complete with purple tongues. In a response essay, conservation researcher Challie Facemire discusses the unforeseen consequences of introducing species where they don\u2019t belong.\n\nWish We\u2019d Published This\n\n\u201cWhy My Bittersweet Relationship With Shein Had to End,\u201d by Zeyi Yang, MIT Technology Review\n\nFuture Tense Recommends\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving found myself in a bit of a streaming rut last month, I finally heeded the recommendations to watch Bad Sisters on Apple TV+. The 10-episode first season premiered in August, and the show was recently renewed for a second season. It follows the five Garvey sisters\u2014Eva, Becka, Bibi, Ursula, and Grace\u2014and begins by showing the body of John Paul, Grace\u2019s husband, in a coffin. We quickly learn that Eva, Becka, Bibi, and Ursula were trying to kill John Paul, who is presented as controlling, manipulative, and emotionally abusive (for starters \u2026 he eventually gets much worse). The show weaves past and present story lines\u2014the events leading up to John Paul\u2019s death, and the fallout from the same\u2014and guides us through stunning Irish landscapes, which, along with the show\u2019s dark-but-smart humor, serve a sort of numbing function for the heavy topics embedded in the plot. Reviewers have pointed out that the show simplifies many of these topics and flattens naturally complex characters, and I think that\u2019s true\u2014we walk away with little understanding of John Paul as anything other than a caricature of misogyny, for example. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s just really entertaining television.\n\nWhat Next: TBD\n\nOn Friday\u2019s episode of Slate\u2019s technology podcast, host Lizzie O\u2019Leary interviewed Tim Requarth, a Slate contributing writer, about how COVID really affects our immune systems. Last week, Lizzie talked to the Washington Post\u2019s Will Oremus about what the rise of A.I. tools like ChatGPT mean for consumers. She also chatted with Bloomberg\u2019s Leah Nylen about why the Department of Justice thinks Google\u2019s ad-tech business needs breaking up, and whether that\u2019s actually likely to happen. And on Sunday, Lizzie will be joined by Ron Lieber of the New York Times to discuss why JPMorgan says it was conned by a young founder who promised to help students get financial aid\u2014and what made her story so magnetic in the first place.\n\nCorrection, Feb. 7, 2023: This piece originally misstated that Lorena Ortiz went on a trip to Japan after Bitcoin hit an all-time high. She decided to forgo the trip to focus on Bitcoin.\n\nFuture Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society."

        "title": "A Case for Bitcoin | School of Business - Liberty University",
        "content": "A Case for Bitcoin\n\nBy: Josh Rogers\n\nSome view Bitcoin as a great investment, while others view it as a complete gamble. I tend to fall into the first category because I believe it has great potential. While this topic could easily be discussed in great depth, I will share a few basic components that support this asset\u2019s credibility.\n\nOver the years, Bitcoin has been considered a volatile investment. As a whole, the cryptocurrency market experiences extreme fluctuations in value. In this relatively new market, much potential for growth exists, but volatility is to be expected since there are many unknowns.\n\nBitcoin is the first cryptocurrency. It can be described as a fully computerized currency protocol. Its main purpose is to seamlessly allow payments to be sent and received through a secure network in the form of bitcoins, allowing value to transfer electronically without any third-party involvement such as a bank.\n\nThe network requires the participation of individuals to keep it running and to confirm transactions as a part of the blockchain. Blockchain technology is an added layer of security that allows information to be validated on multiple servers rather than just one. Bitcoin \u201cminers\u201d use specialized computers to validate transactions on the network and in the process earn fractional amounts of bitcoin as a reward for helping the network function properly.\n\nDespite countless attempts, the Bitcoin network has never been hacked, speaking highly to the network\u2019s security. This component is foundational for the network\u2019s success since its sole purpose is to facilitate secure transactions. If the network remains unaltered, Bitcoin retains the potential to continue to increase in value over time.\n\nWhen considering the recent drop in Bitcoin\u2019s value, it can seem like the network is failing. However, looking beyond the short-term performance, there has been an upward trend in its worth since its establishment nearly 14 years ago. Because Bitcoin has a fixed supply, a time will come when all bitcoins have been \u201cmined\u201d and its value should level out. This event will not occur, however, for over one-hundred years when the last bitcoin is mined, leading to another promising component of Bitcoin\u2019s growth potential\u2014halving cycles.\n\nEvery four years, the amount of bitcoin rewarded on each transaction is cut in half; therefore, those participating in the validation of transactions on the network start to earn half as much as they had earned previously. Considering the law of supply and demand, prices should start to go up dramatically shortly after such a drastic decrease in the incoming supply. Consistent with this concept, Bitcoin has shown a substantial rise in value following each halving cycle throughout its history.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin has been worth thousands of dollars for a large portion of its existence, it was once worth less than one dollar. In the first couple of years, Bitcoin\u2019s value peaked around $30 before the first halving in 2012. This halving brought about the first exponential growth period, in which Bitcoin\u2019s value surpassed $1000. After the second halving that occurred in 2016, its worth reached $20,000. Finally, the most recent halving resulted in a record high of nearly $68,789.\n\nRegardless of this recent all-time high, Bitcoin\u2019s value has tanked throughout this past year. Naturally, the economy has played a factor in the extremity of this sharp decline. To many new market investors, the drop in value came as a surprise; however, the reverse in price should not have been so unexpected considering the pattern of the halving cycles. If history is any indication of Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory, its value has potential to grow similarly following the next halving, which is projected to occur in early 2024.\n\nThe components of Bitcoin mentioned above provide reason to believe that it may be a worthwhile investment. Recognizing the fixed supply and recurring halving cycles, it is safe to conclude that Bitcoin\u2019s value could continue to increase over time, assuming the network remains secure. Even with the validity of these arguments, however, Bitcoin remains a highly volatile and risky investment. As with any monetary decision, it is best to be prayerful and seek wisdom from trusted financial professionals on this investment option. If properly researched and understood, Bitcoin could be a good option to consider as a portion of a holistic financial plan."

        "content": "Cathie Wood is finally admitting she got some things wrong about Bitcoin.\n\nThe founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management said Thursday that she and her team misjudged the uptake of the cryptocurrency\u2014or at least the timing of it\u2014by companies and governments. Her firm has invested heavily in Bitcoin and continues to bet on its eventual rise to meteoric heights.\n\n\u201cWe tempered a few assumptions,\u201d she told Bloomberg Radio on Thursday. \u201cWe thought that\u2014led by Tesla, Block (formerly Square), and MicroStrategy\u2014more corporations would put Bitcoin on their balance sheets. We\u2019ve dialed that one down considerably. And the same thing with nation-states.\u201d\n\nBitcoin lost nearly 65% of its value over 2022, ending the year at about $16,500. It currently stands at just over $23,500.\n\nCompanies holding Bitcoin, not surprisingly, took a beating last year. Tesla for example said in a regulatory filing this week that it registered a $204 million impairment loss on its Bitcoin holdings in 2022. As the cryptocurrency plunged, it sold 75% of its holdings last year.\n\nMeanwhile few governments were eager to follow the lead of El Salvador, which in 2021 became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. A Bloomberg article in November last year carried the headline, \u201cEl Salvador\u2019s $300 Million Bitcoin \u2018Revolution\u2019 Is Failing Miserably.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther countries will probably not move as quickly as they might have if El Salvador had had a grand swoosh right off the bat,\u201d said Wood. \u201cWe do think it will happen, it\u2019s just we\u2019ve pushed it out a bit.\u201d\n\nAs for why it will happen, she noted the inflation and fiscal crises people have suffered due to governments\u2019 monetary responses to the pandemic. \u201cWell, where do these people go for an insurance policy against an implosion in their purchasing power and wealth? It is in something like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an insurance policy,\u201d she said.\n\nBitcoin \u2018could pass $1 million\u2019\n\nWood acknowledged that 2022 was a \u201cterrible year for everything crypto.\u201d But she said it was \u201cthe centralized, opaque players\u201d like crypto exchange FTX that went bankrupt. Bitcoin, by contrast, \u201cis a rules-based digital monetary system, and it\u2019s global, and there\u2019s no human intervention,\u201d she added.\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried didn\u2019t like Bitcoin because \u201cit\u2019s transparent and decentralized. He couldn\u2019t control it,\u201d Wood said in December.\n\nWood is sticking to her prediction that Bitcoin will see a rapid rise in value in the coming years. In five years, she said, it will hit \u201croughly $670,000, something like that, and then by 2030, as we see more use cases and more of these insurance policies taken out against fiscal and policy regimes that are not healthy, we think it could pass $1 million.\u201d\n\nPlenty of doubters have questioned her prediction. As Bloomberg host Carol Massar noted to Wood, \u201cPeople are saying to me, \u2018Really? Does she really stick to this?\u2019\u201d\n\nMark Mobius, the billionaire cofounder of Mobius Capital Partners, predicted in December that Bitcoin would fall to $10,000 at some point this year.\n\nAnd this week, Warren Buffett\u2019s right-hand man Charlie Munger argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that a \u201ccryptocurrency is not a currency, not a commodity, and not a security. Instead, it\u2019s a gambling contract with a nearly 100% edge for the house.\u201d\n\nMunger, who once called Bitcoin \u201crat poison,\u201d said the U.S. should follow China\u2019s lead and pass laws that prevent both crypto trading and the formation of new cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "The rise of bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market - Open Access Government",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market, a digital or virtual currency marketplace that uses cryptography for security, has been on the rise in recent years \u2013 here\u2019s why\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is decentralized, meaning no one organization or governmental body has jurisdiction over it. Instead, it operates on a blockchain, a public ledger that records all transactions. 2009 saw the creation of the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, by an unidentified person or group going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nSince then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been created, with varying levels of success.\n\nThe rise of bitcoin\n\nBitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, has seen a significant increase in value and mainstream acceptance in recent years. In 2009, the value of one Bitcoin was less than a penny. But by December 2017, the value had risen to nearly $20,000. This increase in value has attracted the attention of both individual investors and institutional investors.\n\nMany have begun to see cryptocurrency as a legitimate form of investment, rather than just a speculative gamble. This mainstream acceptance has also led to the development of various financial products, such as futures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), that allow investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market without actually owning any coins.\n\nThe impact of cryptocurrency on the financial industry\n\nThe rise of the cryptocurrency market has also had a significant impact on the financial industry. It has challenged traditional financial institutions, such as banks and payment processors, by providing a decentralized and secure alternative to traditional financial services. For example, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be used to make peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a middleman, such as a bank.\n\nThis has the potential to disrupt the traditional banking system and the way we conduct financial transactions. A Bitcoin wallet is a software program that allows individuals to store, send, and receive Bitcoin. It also manages a person\u2019s private key, which is used to access and conduct transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nWhen an individual wants to make a transaction, they use their wallet to send the desired amount of Bitcoin from their address to the recipient\u2019s address.\n\nThe transaction is then broadcast to the network and confirmed by miners, who add it to the blockchain. Once added to the blockchain, the transaction is considered complete and the funds are transferred to the recipient\u2019s wallet. Bitcoin wallets provide a convenient and secure way to manage one\u2019s Bitcoin transactions. In addition, blockchain technology, which is the underlying technology of cryptocurrency, has the potential to revolutionize many industries beyond just finance. It can be used for everything from supply chain management to voting systems.\n\nThe role of cryptocurrency in e-commerce\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has the potential to revolutionize e-commerce by providing a secure and decentralized way for businesses to accept payments. Online retailers can use cryptocurrency to avoid the high fees and chargebacks associated with traditional payment methods. Additionally, the use of blockchain technology can make e-commerce transactions more secure and transparent.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has the potential to revolutionize e-commerce\n\nOne of the most popular use cases of cryptocurrency in e-commerce is the use of stablecoins. These are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of a fiat currency, such as the US dollar, to avoid the volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies. This makes them a more viable option for e-commerce transactions.\n\nThe use of cryptocurrency in the gaming industry\n\nCryptocurrency has also been gaining popularity in the gaming industry. Players can use the cryptocurrency market to purchase in-game items and virtual currencies, and game developers can use blockchain technology to create decentralized and transparent gaming platforms. One example of this is the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the gaming industry. NFTs are unique digital assets that can be bought, sold, and traded like physical assets. They can be used to represent in-game items, such as weapons or armor, and can even be used to represent virtual real estate.\n\nThe role of cryptocurrency in social media\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrency has also had an impact on social media. Platforms such as Steemit and Minds allow users to earn cryptocurrency by creating and curating content. This incentivizes users to create high-quality content and rewards them for their efforts. In addition, some social media platforms are now accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment for advertising and other services. This allows businesses to reach a wider audience and provides a new revenue stream for the social media platforms.\n\nChallenges faced by cryptocurrency\n\nDespite the rise of cryptocurrency, it is still a relatively new and untested technology. There are several challenges that need to be addressed in order for it to reach its full potential. The absence of regulations is one of the major problems. Because cryptocurrency operates outside of traditional financial systems, it is not subject to the same level of oversight and regulation. Concerns around fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities have arisen as a result of this.\n\nWhile the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has risen, they are still not widely accepted as a form of payment\n\nAnother challenge is the lack of mainstream acceptance. While the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has risen, they are still not widely accepted as a form of payment. This makes it difficult for people to use them in their daily lives. Finally, there is the issue of scalability. The blockchain technology that underlies cryptocurrency can only process a limited number of transactions per second. This may result in lengthy transaction delays and expensive costs.\n\nSince the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, cryptocurrency has advanced significantly\n\nIt has seen a significant increase in value and mainstream acceptance, and has the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. However, there are still challenges that need to be addressed in order for it to reach its full potential. The development of cryptocurrency is an ongoing process, and it will be interesting to see how it evolves in the coming years."

        "content": "On a recent visit to Sri Lanka, American billionaire Tim Draper pitched the idea of adopting Bitcoin (BTC) as a legal tender to fight against the corruption that contributed to hyperinflation in the island country. However, a key Sri Lankan authority \u2014 central bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe \u2014 believed doing so would worsen the country\u2019s economic situation.\n\nTaking time from a TV shoot in Sri Lanka, Draper met President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Weerasinghe to recommend Bitcoin as a viable option for getting out of financial problems.\n\nTim Draper in Sri Lanka speaking about economic development. Source: YouTube\n\nDuring the meeting, Draper pointed out a key concern staring right at Sri Lanka:\n\n\u201cHave you seen Sri Lanka in the news? It\u2019s known as the corruption capital. A country known for corruption will be able to keep perfect records with the adoption of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAs he recommended using \u201cdecentralized currency\u201d to the head of Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank, he received a short \u201cwe don\u2019t accept\u201d reply. Weerasinghe further stated:\n\n\u201cAdoption of 100% Bitcoin won\u2019t be a Sri Lanka reality ever.\u201d\n\nInstead, Weerasinghe believed that having Sri Lanka\u2019s own fiat currency was critical for monetary-policy independence and would ensure efficient inclusion and disburse electronic welfare payments.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to make the crisis worse by introducing Bitcoin,\u201d Weerasinghe concluded.\n\nRelated: Australia introduces classification for crypto assets\n\nMicroStrategy, a software analytics company co-founded by Michael Saylor, shared plans to continue offering BTC trading services despite incurring an unrealized loss of $1.3 billion in 2022.\n\nDuring a Feb. 2 earnings call, MicroStrategy\u2019s chief financial officer, Andrew Kang, said:\n\n\u201cWe may consider pursuing additional transactions that may take advantage of the volatility in Bitcoin prices, or other market dislocations that are consistent with our long-term Bitcoin strategy.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kang, MicroStrategy held 132,500 BTC (worth $1.84 billion) as of Dec. 31, 2022. Of the lot, 14,890 BTC were held directly by the business and the rest by its subsidiary MacroStrategy."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 2.50% in the week from Jan. 27 to Feb. 3, trading at US$23,528 at 8 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether gained 4.47% in the same timeframe, to change hands at US$1,648.\n\nBitcoin surged 39.93% in January, rallying from US$16,496 at the start of the month to US$23,954 by Jan. 31, making it the best month since Oct. 2021, when the cryptocurrency also rallied more than 39%.\n\nDinesh Goel, founder of play-to-earn ecosystem One World Nation, said US$23,000 was a \u201cwait-and-watch level\u201d for Bitcoin holders. \u201cInvestors were optimistic that the Federal Reserve would give positive news but were also cautious of the impending recession fears. Overall, it has been a balanced outcome from the [Fed],\u201d wrote Goel in an email. Bitcoin will advance upwards, slowly and steadily, he added.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has signaled that it plans to raise interest rates further, but economist George Brown said the latest 25 basis point rate hike may have been the Fed\u2019s last.\n\n\u201cEconomic activity is beginning to soften as rate rises have gained traction. And forward-looking measures such as the Conference Board\u2019s leading indicator are flashing red.\u201d wrote Brown in a report shared with Forkast. \u201cThe labor market is showing tentative signs of turning\u2026 [and] inflation has convincingly moderated and should continue to do so.\u201d\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic was the week\u2019s biggest gainer among the 10 largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, up 10.43% on the weekly chart, trading at US$1.19.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at US$1.08 trillion on Friday at 8 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 2.85% from US$1.05 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$461 billion represented 41.9% of the market, while Ether took up 18.7%.\n\nBiggest gainers\n\nThe Render Network\u2019s token (RNDR) was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe token jumped 103.09% to trade at US$1.70 after Render Network said it received governance approval for a burn and mint mechanism for its native token.\n\nThe Render Network allows idle GPUs (graphics processing units) to be used for the digital rendering needed in fields like 3D modeling, gaming imagery, and virtual reality.\n\nDecentralized derivatives exchange dYdX\u2019s native token (DYDX) rose 49.22% to US$3.19, making it the week\u2019s second-best gainer, after the exchange announced a lock-up extension for over 150 million tokens, meaning these tokens will only be released to early investors in December this year instead of February.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin mining fund soars as BTC powers into 2023\n\nWhat\u2019s ahead?\n\n\u201cThe general outlook and guidance are positive, which will ensure Bitcoin stays above $23,000 for a while,\u201d wrote Goel, adding that he expects more bullish momentum and that \u201cBitcoin will start testing the $25k level towards the end of this week.\u201c\n\n\u201cThe crypto market may see better days in the coming week since the market sentiment has been risk on. The FED\u2019s 25 basis point rate hike on Feb. 1 sent the dollar sliding. Based on the idea of the recent rate hike, cryptocurrencies may have a strong run-up going next week,\u201d wrote Adam Robertson, crypto market analyst and reporter at crypto.news.\n\nAsset management giant ARK Invest published the seventh edition of their report, Big Ideas 2023, on Feb. 1. The report estimates that the price of one Bitcoin could exceed US$1 million by 2030.\n\nArk outlines three scenarios for Bitcoin in 2030: a bear case, which puts it at US$258,500 with a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR); a base case, which estimates US$682,800 with a CAGR of 60%; and a bull case, which predicts that Bitcoin will grow with a 75% CAGR to reach US$1.48 million by 2030.\n\nOne World Nation\u2019s Goel said this prediction may be exaggerated: \u201cWhat they mean to say is \u2014 We believe in crypto, we believe in Bitcoin and it is the future,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cA US$1 million price will peg the Bitcoin market cap at US$21 trillion, ~17% of the world\u2019s 2030 projected GDP of US$126 trillion. This would need Bitcoin to be used by almost everyone in the world. And the current challenges are technology and regulation, which will take a while to get solved,\u201c said Goel.\n\nBitcoin analyst Willy Woo wrote that the recent gains can be linked to institutional buyers.\n\n\u201cThis recent rally coincides with a new pattern emerging of stablecoins flowing into exchanges during work days only. Seems to me like the heat signature of large institutions doing the buying,\u201d Woo said.\n\n\u201cSince this rally began, spot flows are dominant and leading over derivatives,\u201d wrote Woo, adding that spot buying is moving the price, which \u201cimplies that long-term institutional investors are coming in via spot buying and moving to custody.\u201d\n\nPseudonymous crypto analyst Rekt Capital tweeted: \u201cBTC would need to break beyond ~US$26500 to break the macro downtrend this February.\u201d \u201cThe price point that would represent the macro downtrend next month is ~$24600.\u201d\n\nSee related article: New Bitcoin protocol may shake up the NFT market"

        "title": "Did Goldman Sachs Just Give Bitcoin a Seal of Approval? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "For crypto investors, 2022 is starting to feel like a distant memory. In 2023, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC 1.50%) are soaring and investor appetite is returning for even the riskiest tokens. Even Goldman Sachs Group (GS 1.06%) -- once a critic of the crypto asset class -- is getting into the act. According to a new Goldman Sachs report, Bitcoin is now the best-performing asset in the world on both an absolute and risk-adjusted basis.\n\nThe findings from that report could have important implications for Bitcoin's future price trajectory. Remember, it was just one year ago that Goldman Sachs slapped a $100,000 price target on Bitcoin, so this report might mark the much-anticipated return of bullish sentiment for crypto on Wall Street in 2023.\n\nRisk-adjusted versus absolute returns\n\nGoldman Sachs compared both risk-adjusted and absolute returns across 25 different asset classes. Bitcoin ranked No. 1 in absolute returns and No. 1 in terms of risk-adjusted returns. The next closest competitor was the MSCI Emerging Markets index, but it wasn't even close. The MSCI Emerging Markets index offered a lower absolute return and lower risk-adjusted returns as well.\n\nIn order to calculate risk-adjusted returns, Goldman Sachs used a popular metric called the Sharpe ratio, which compares the return of an investment with its underlying risk and volatility. In short, it's not enough to say that Bitcoin is now up nearly 40% year to date, because everyone knows that crypto is a very risky and volatile asset class. You are taking on tremendous risk to generate those returns. If another investment could generate those same returns by taking on less risk, it would be superior.\n\nThat's why I was blown away by the Goldman Sachs numbers. Even taking into account all the inherent volatility of crypto, Bitcoin was still a better investment than any other asset class on the planet. It beat out risky assets like emerging market stocks and high-yield debt, and it beat out much safer investments like gold and the S&P 500. The Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin was 3.1, which is absolutely phenomenal. When calculating this ratio, anything between 1 and 2 is considered good, and anything between 2 and 3 is very good. So Bitcoin absolutely hit it out of the park in January.\n\nThe implications\n\nThis is great news for crypto as an asset class, and could make Bitcoin much more palatable for institutional investors with a low risk tolerance. In 2022, Goldman Sachs began offering new Bitcoin-related products and services to clients, and this January report might be the key to offering even more in 2023. After all, when FTX collapsed last year, it was rumored Goldman Sachs was going to start buying crypto assets on the cheap. Could this bullish report on Bitcoin be the prelude to new moves by Goldman Sachs in the crypto market?\n\nThe big caveat here is that one month is a short period of time. Just because Bitcoin soared in January doesn't mean it's headed straight up for the rest of 2023. Crypto still remains a risky and volatile asset class. If you're a crypto skeptic, you could just as easily interpret the new Goldman Sachs data on risk-adjusted returns to mean: If you're crazy enough to take on all the volatility of crypto, then Bitcoin gives you the best bang for your buck.\n\nMoreover, consider just how quickly sentiment can change. In December, Goldman Sachs released completely contradictory findings suggesting that gold is a better investment than Bitcoin. At that time, the outlook for the economy looked bleak and it might have been natural to assume that gold would continue to outperform Bitcoin in 2023. But, as we've seen through the first month of this year, that hasn't been the case.\n\nThe big picture for Bitcoin\n\nTaking a big-picture view, it's clear the macroeconomic outlook for the economy plays a major role in how investors view Bitcoin. At one time, people thought Bitcoin's performance was completely uncorrelated with the broader financial market, but now that appears to be false. As the broader market goes, so goes Bitcoin. The good news is, that at least according to Goldman Sachs, Bitcoin looks like one of the best investments you can make if you believe U.S. economic growth is returning.\n\nGoing forward, I'm keeping a close eye on what's happening with institutional investors in the crypto market. If they are bullish on Bitcoin, then that's a good sign. It means there will be tremendous support for the crypto asset class from some of the smartest investors in the world. As they allocate some of their portfolios to crypto, that could push up the value of Bitcoin. For that reason, I remain bullish on Bitcoin both short- and long-term."

        "content": "The first steps of a multi-stage plan to regulate the cryptocurrency industry within Australia have been released.\n\nThe Australian government has announced the first step of what it calls a multi-stage approach to tackling cryptocurrency regulation.\n\nAccording to the announcement, \u201cthe multi\u2011stage approach has three elements: strengthening enforcement, bolstering consumer protection; and establishing a framework for reform.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe first step begins with the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) increasing the size of its crypto team and \u201cupping enforcement measures.\u201d These enforcement measures described include taking legal action when cryptocurrencies are marketed without appropriate financial licenses. In addition, the report describes that particular attention will be paid to making sure risks are properly disclosed to consumers.\n\n\n\nThese steps are intended to step up efforts targeting scams, especially those involving cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThe Government\u2019s National Anti\u2011Scams Centre, located within the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), will facilitate real\u2011time data sharing and the coordinated prevention and disruption of scams,\u201d reads the report, indicating that the collection of data will be a major part of the operations.\n\nIn addition to the steps announced today, the government introduced a token mapping consultation paper addressing \u201cwhich elements of the crypto ecosystem are sufficiently regulated and which require additional attention.\u201d The paper addresses Bitcoin specifically, describing it as a cryptocurrency network with the intent to operate as a \u201cpeer-to-peer payment structure,\u201d as a \u201cnew form of currency.\u201d In addition, the use cases of Bitcoin are illustrated, including its use as a store of value, and as a medium of exchange, \u201cparticularly in emerging markets.\u201d\n\nThe Australian government's multi-stage approach to cryptocurrency regulation is designed to protect consumers while also providing oversight and regulatory clarity, but it remains to be seen if this regulatory environment will stifle growth and innovation, or fulfill its intended purpose while harboring growth.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Binance\u2019s BNB led the gainers, while Dogecoin lost some more steam following a jump earlier this week on speculation it may play a role in the Twitter payment system being considered by Elon Musk. U.S. tech stocks gained overnight in market hours, but Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. fell after-hours on disappointing Q4 earnings released after the market closed.\n\nSee related article: Crypto hackers stole record US$3.8 bln in 2022, mostly from DeFi and cross-chain bridges: Chainalysis\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin slipped 0.93% to US$23,500 in the 24 hours to 8 a.m. in Hong Kong, but is up 1.91% in the past seven days. Ether inched 0.23% higher to US$1,645, adding to gains for the week of 2.49%, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has been able to maintain its $23,000 price level, which it broke last week. While there is some selling pressure at $24,000, the higher resistance levels are a positive for the crypto market,\u201d Rachel Lin, the co-founder and chief executive officer of crypto derivatives exchange SynFutures, told Forkast in an emailed comment.\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB token gained 1.87% to US$323.29, leading the gains among the top 10 non-stablecoin tokens by market capitalization, and adding 6% over the past week. Polkadot and memecoin Shiba Inu both rose 1.25%.\n\nDogecoin lost 3.12% to US$0.0912, while layer-1 blockchain Solana\u2019s native token fell 2.61% to US$24.34. Dogecoin is still up 5.36% for the seven days after the token\u2019s advocate and Twitter chief executive Elon Musk said he was looking to add a payments system to the social media platform, fuelling speculation Dogecoin may be included.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market capitalization dipped 0.19% to US$1.08 trillion, while total trading volume grew 18.40% to US$65.89 billion.\n\nU.S. equities were mixed on Thursday. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index added 3.25% and the S&P 500 Index gained 1.47%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.11%.\n\nApple shares rose 3.71% in Thursday market-hours trading but then reversed after-hours to drop 3.2% when it released its 2022 Q4 earnings report that showed revenue fell 5% \u2014 the largest year-on-year decline since 2019. Shares in Amazon.com and Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet followed the same pattern; rising during market hours and then falling after-market due to disappointing earnings reports.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday raised interest rates by 50 basis points to 2.5%, confirming expectations, and indicated it will raise another 50 basis points in March in its statement. The Bank of England also hiked interest rates by 50 basis points to 4% from 3.5%. However, it added that inflation may have peaked in the UK.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates by 25 basis points, the smallest increase since March 2022. Fed chair Jerome Powell commented that the U.S. economy is seeing the start of a \u201cdisinflationary process\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe [Fed] interest rate hike, which was consistent with market expectations, coupled with the notion that disinflation is underway, has instilled even greater confidence in investors. This is evident in the upward trend we\u2019re seeing in both the stock market and cryptocurrency market,\u201d Henry Liu, the CEO of BTSE cryptocurrency exchange, told Forkast via email.\n\nU.S. non-farm payroll data, another key inflation indicator, will be out later on Friday.\n\nSee related article: Bankrupt FTX held US$1.4B in cash at the end of 2022"

        "content": "Smaller bitcoin devotees are colloquially known as HODLrs, as in \u201cholding on for dear life.\u201d Indeed, the largest digital currency and many of its peers can be volatile assets that try investors\u2019 patience and ability to hold over lengthy periods.\n\nStill, some market observers believe bitcoin offers massive upside from current prices of just below $24,000. In fact, some believe the cryptocurrency could appreciate dozens of times over during the next decade, indicating that there could be significant rewards for market participants with the temerity to hold even a small amount of bitcoin for an extend period.\n\nIn its new 2023 Big Ideas report, ARK Investment Management estimated that bitcoin could run to $1 million in the next decade \u2014 easily one of the most bullish forecasts around.\n\n\u201cWe believe Bitcoin\u2019s long-term opportunity is strengthening. Despite a turbulent year, Bitcoin has not skipped a beat. Its network fundamentals have strengthened and its holder base has become more long-term focused,\u201d according to ARK. \u201cContagion caused by centralized counterparties has elevated Bitcoin\u2019s value propositions: decentralization, auditability, and transparency.\u201d\n\nARK\u2019s bitcoin forecast emerges after the digital currency notched an impressive January, erasing some of its 2022 declines. Speaking of bitcoin\u2019s 2022 bear market, as ARK noted, it was the fifth-largest in terms of value shed and second-longest from a time perspective.\n\nAs 2022 drew to a close, some crypto market observers noted that deep, extended bitcoin declines historically gave way to the reverse scenario: significant rallies. It remains to be seen if that history repeats this year, but it\u2019s a fact that bitcoin needs to almost triple to reclaim the all-time of around $69,000.\n\nOwing to bitcoin\u2019s aforementioned reputation for volatility, some investors may be more apt to take quick gains and not wait around for prices to double, let alone triple. However, historical data indicate that bitcoin has previously displayed merit as a long-term holding.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s volatility has obscured its long-term returns. Despite five drawdowns greater than 75% since its inception in 2009, bitcoin has delivered positive annualized returns over 3-, 4-, and 5-year time horizons,\u201d added ARK.\n\nAdding to the bitcoin case are data points suggesting, as ARK pointed out, that many investors weren\u2019t spooked by the collapse of crypto broker FTX and the ensuing contagion effect. Said another way, some investors realized that FTX likely perpetrated fraud and that wasn\u2019t necessarily direct commentary on crypto fundamentals.\n\n\u201cDespite extreme market fear fueled by the collapse of several major crypto entities, on-chain data suggest that bitcoin holders remained focused on long-term fundamentals,\u201d concluded ARK.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel .\n\nThe opinions and forecasts expressed herein are solely those of Tom Lydon, and may not actually come to pass.

        "content": "A New Jersey man admitted to paying $20,000 in cryptocurrency to have a 14-year-old child murdered, according to a news release from the Department of Justice on Thursday.\n\nJohn Michael Musbach, 31, pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with one count of \"knowingly and intentionally using and causing another to use a facility of interstate and foreign commerce, that is the internet, with the intent that a murder be committed,\" according to the news release.\n\nMusbach is a resident of Haddonfield, N.J., but lived in Atlantic County when he first made contact with the unidentified victim, prosecutors say. The victim lived in New York at the time.\n\nMusbach exchanged sexually explicit photos and videos with the victim in the summer of 2015, the DOJ said, and the victim's parents called police when they found out about the \"inappropriate contact.\" New York law enforcement officers identified Musbach as an Atlantic County resident and contacted the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office (ACPO). In March 2016, ACPO officers arrested Musbach on child pornography charges, the DOJ said.\n\nAfter Musbach was arrested, he \"decided to have the victim killed so the victim could not testify against him in the pending criminal case,\" prosecutors allege. During a two-week period in May 2016, Musbach \"repeatedly communicated\" with the administrator of a murder-for-hire website on the dark net, the DOJ said. The website, which was not named by the DOJ, purported to offer contract killings or other violent acts in return for cryptocurrency payments.\n\nMusbach allegedly arranged for a murder-to-hire and asked the purported hit man if \"a 14-year-old was too young to target.\" Prosecutors say Musbach then paid $20,000 in bitcoin for the hit. After Musbach asked the website's administrator for more details about the hit and when it would occur, he was pressed for an additional $5,000, the DOJ said.\n\nWhen Musbach then tried to cancel the hit, the website administrator revealed the \"website was a scam,\" and threatened to reveal Musbach's information to law enforcement, prosecutors said.\n\nThe DOJ did not say if it was the website administrator who made authorities aware of Musbach's murder-for-hire plot.\n\nThe charge of use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of at least $250,000, the DOJ said. Musbach is scheduled to be sentenced on June 13."

        "content": "The second largest publicly-listed holder of Bitcoin, crypto mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings has offloaded some of its Bitcoin (BTC) for the first time in two years.\n\nA spokesman told Cointelegraph this was not a result of financial distress.\n\nAccording to an update posted on Feb. 2, the company disclosed that during January it sold 1,500 BTC, worth $35.3 million at current prices.\n\nWhile some crypto miners have been forced to sell Bitcoin due to distress, Marathon vice president of corporate communications Charlie Schumacher said this was not the case for Marathon.\n\nMarathon Digital's Bitcoin Mining Data Center in Hardin, Montana. Source: Marathon Digital\n\nSchumacher said that Marathon had been diamond-handing its Bitcoin until now, as the firm didn\u2019t want to sell while production was down, and has been bullish on the long-term prospects of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nBut coming into the new year, Marathon wants to have a \u201cwar-chest\u201d of liquidity composed of both cash and Bitcoin and is looking to continue paying down debt and increase its cash positions.\n\nSchumacher also noted that Bitcoin\u2019s recent uptick in price contributed to the decision to sell some of its holdings.\n\nJanuary saw Bitcoin rise above the $24,000 price level for the first time since August.\n\nEven after the sale, Marathon managed to increase its unrestricted Bitcoin holdings in the month to 8,090 BTC ($189.8 million).\n\nOperational highlights from Marathon\u2019s latest update. Source: Marathon Digital Holdings\n\nMarathon said it also had significantly ramped up Bitcoin production throughout January, producing 687 BTC, which represents an increase of 45% compared to the month prior. In the update, Marathon chairman and CEO Fred Thiel noted:\n\n\u201cThe improvement in our bitcoin production was primarily a result of our team\u2019s ability to work in tandem with the new hosting provider in McCamey, Texas, to address the maintenance and technical issues at the King Mountain data center that had suppressed our bitcoin production in the fourth quarter of 2022.\"\n\nLast year, Marathon noted in a May 4 update that the last time it had sold any Bitcoin was on Oct. 21, 2020, and has been hodling since then.\n\nWhen asked how it had managed to avoid selling the main product of its business operations, Schumacher pointed to the firm\u2019s low headcount, consisting of \u201c32 people as of today,\u201d and suggested it was a result of sound long-term financial strategies.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price is up, but BTC mining stocks could remain vulnerable throughout 2023\n\nMarathon is the second-biggest publicly listed holder of Bitcoin according to CoinGecko, beaten only by software analytics company MicroStrategy. It has recorded a significant boost in its share price in recent days, with MARA stock rising 135% so far this year to $8, according to MarketWatch."

        "title": "Bitcoin's big month: Did US institutions prevail over Asian retail traders? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin experienced the second-strongest January in its history \u2014 and the best since 2013 \u2014 rising nearly 40% amid wide reports that institutional investors were back on board.\n\nZhong Yang Chan, head of research at CoinGecko, told Cointelegraph that there were \u201cnet institutional inflows into digital asset funds in January 2023, particularly in the last two weeks, with Bitcoin the largest beneficiary.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a Jan. 30 CoinShares blog noted that the total assets under management in digital asset investment products \u2014 a good gauge of institutional participation \u2014 had risen to $28 billion, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which was up 43% from November 2022\u2019s low point in the current cycle.\n\nThe reasons for this bullishness varied depending on whom one asked, ranging from macro factors like a pause in inflation growth to more technical reasons like a squeeze on BTC short sellers. Elsewhere, a research report from Matrixport noted that institutional investors are \u201cnot giving up on crypto,\u201d further suggesting that as much as 85% of Bitcoin buying in January was the result of U.S. institutional players. The cryptocurrency services provider added that many investors had used the U.S. Jan. 12 Consumer Price Index print \u201cas a confirmation signal to buy Bitcoin and other crypto assets.\u201d\n\nAlmost all gains were during U.S. market hours\n\nBut how did Matrixport come to attribute up to 85% of monthly BTC growth to U.S. institutional investors? As the Singapore-based firm explained in its recent market overview: \u201cThe most astonishing statistic is that almost all of the +40% year-to-date rally in Bitcoin has happened during US market hours. [...] That\u2019s 85% of the Bitcoin move.\u201d Matrixport continued:\n\n\u201cWe have always worked with the assumption that Asia is driven by retail investors, and the US is driven by institutional investors.\u201d\n\nSo, if Bitcoin\u2019s market price rises during U.S. market trading hours but falls during Asian trading hours, as seemed to be happening in January, can one assume that U.S. institutional investors were buying Bitcoin while Asian retail traders were selling it \u2014 a sort of yin-and-yang action? Apparently so. During U.S. trading hours, \u201cinstitutions, aka \u2018stable hands,\u2019\u201d were taking advantage of the dips, added Matrixport.\n\nRecent: State of play: Decentralized domain services reflect on industry progress\n\nIs this really what drove BTC\u2019s price upward in January? \u201cIn my personal opinion, the assumption that Asian retail and U.S. institutional investors are two main drivers of net Bitcoin flows is valid,\u201d Keone Hon, co-founder and CEO at Monad Labs \u2014 which developed the Monad blockchain \u2014 told Cointelegraph. There are other market participants, of course; but when looking at flows, \u201cirregular ones\u201d have the largest impact, continued Hon:\n\n\u201cIn the current market, institutional players represent a potentially new \u2014 or renewed \u2014 source of demand similar to early 2021. Meanwhile, on the retail side, Asia-centric exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Okex and Huobi represent a majority of spot volume and nearly all of the derivatives volume.\u201d\n\nOthers, though, aren\u2019t so sure. \u201cThere is no way to confirm that U.S. markets are driven by institutional investors and Asian markets are driven by retail players since we don\u2019t have data related to the identity of traders,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CryptoCompare, told Cointelegraph.\n\nGranted, there is a \u201csentiment\u201d or belief that large retail interest exists in Asia, \u201cespecially in Korea, as KRW represents the fourth-largest trading pair after USDT, BUSD and USD,\u201d continued Joseph, but it can\u2019t really be quantified.\n\nStill, he acknowledged that the Matrixport report was interesting, adding, \u201cOur data shows that more than two-thirds of the BTC returns in January can be attributed to the U.S. market hours, and our historical hourly data also shows that an above-average volume is traded during these hours.\u201d\n\nJustin d\u2019Anethan, institutional sales director at the Amber Group \u2014 a Singapore-based digital asset firm \u2014 told Cointelegraph, \u201cI don\u2019t really have metrics to say whether 85% is on point or not.\u201d He was inclined to see the January rally as broad and macro-driven, especially with inflation heading lower and expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve won\u2019t keep raising rates. He added:\n\n\u201cYou can see equities, gold, real estate, and, yes, crypto gaining. That\u2019s probably driven by large institutions and smaller investors alike, especially when FOMO kicks in.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Anethan also looked at Coinbase\u2019s recent premium index, \u201cwhich is in the green but not massively. That\u2019s typically a good metric to see if bigger American entities are on a shopping spree. Right now, it looks muted, positive, but probably just reallocating cash that was sitting on the sidelines.\u201d\n\nJacob said that a better way to gauge U.S. institutional activity is to look at exchanges \u201cthat cater their services solely to them.\u201d Along these lines, \u201cCME Group, the largest institutional exchange in crypto, saw its monthly volume rise 59% in January,\u201d while LMAX Digital, another institutional-focused exchange, \u201calso saw its trading volumes rise 84.1%, higher than the average increase in trading volume on other exchanges.\u201d\n\nThen, too, who\u2019s to say Asian retail traders aren\u2019t operating during U.S. market hours? Chan, for instance, acknowledged that while the markets \u201cdo tend to move more during U.S. hours,\u201d CoinGecko believes that this is \u201cmore a reflection of the outsized influence that U.S. monetary policy currently has on the crypto market and broader financial markets. Traders are most active when they believe markets are volatile, and in the current environment, Asian traders may have also gravitated toward \u2018Fed watching\u2019 to catch potential market movements.\u201d\n\nChris Kuiper, director of research at Fidelity Digital Assets, told Cointelegraph that there isn\u2019t a single event or catalyst that one can point to, to explain Bitcoin\u2019s recent price movement. But to him, \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising given the conditions that have been forming \u2014 namely, the increasing amount of illiquid coins, coins that haven\u2019t moved in over a year \u2014 and the continued outflow of coins from exchanges.\u201d Both factors make for a lower supply of BTC \u201cand create conditions ripe for higher moves.\u201d\n\nKuiper also cited the futures and derivatives market as a factor in BTC\u2019s climb, \u201cwith a large amount of shorts getting liquidated over the past few weeks.\u201d D\u2019Anethan, too, mentioned \u201cshort-sellers getting squeezed\u201d as a possible driver. \u201cIn itself, it\u2019s not a cause for [prices] going up, but when things do rise, it accelerates it.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead\n\nBe that as it may, if one agrees that January held some promise for Bitcoin on the institutional front, can one necessarily assume that it will persist through 2023?\n\n\u201cAs the market gains clarity on which players avoided contagion, we\u2019ll see an uptick in new entrants that were sidelined during the back half of last year, particularly as innovative custody agreements emerge to address the major pain points of the recent collapses,\u201d David Wells, CEO of digital asset trading platform Enclave Markets, told Cointelegraph.\n\nRecent: What crypto hodlers should keep in mind as tax season approaches\n\nMore needs to be done to maintain institutional momentum, the executive stated. \u201cTo really attract institutional flow, crypto markets will need to build more sophisticated products that allow for proper hedging and risk management,\u201d added Wells. He\u2019s optimistic providers will rise to the challenge, however.\n\nIt appears that inflation may have peaked, and many expect the U.S. Fed and perhaps other central banks to slow the pace at which they tighten interest rates, said Kuiper. While that does not necessarily portend rising risk-asset prices, \u201cinstitutions and other asset allocators in the longer-term may once again turn to Bitcoin if central banks ease aggressively as they have done in the past,\u201d he concluded."

Still, the mood in the market is as positive as it was back then.\n\nThat's the message from funding rates, a mechanism that keeps the prices of bitcoin perpetual futures contracts in sync with the spot market price. When perpetual futures are trading above spot, the funding rate is positive and holders of bullish long, or buy, positions pay bearish shorts to keep their trade open. The opposite happens when perpetuals trade below the spot price.\n\nAnalysts track the funding rate to gauge the mood of leverage traders. The higher the funding rate, the more excited traders are about price prospects and the more willing to pay a premium to keep their upside bets open.\n\nAs of Thursday, the annualized bitcoin perpetual funding rates across major exchanges including Binance was 8.491%, the highest since Dec. 3, 2021, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.\n\nBack then, one bitcoin was priced around $57,000, or 2.5 times the current market rate of $23,400. The cryptocurrency set a record high of $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nThe funding rate flipped positive in mid-December last year, indicating seller exhaustion. The cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid at the turn of the year and has rallied over 40% since then.\n\n\"There has been a clear shift in market sentiment post-[December) CPI with funding rates well into positive territory and price volatility on the rise,\" Dessislava Laneva, a research analyst at Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko, said in a tweet referring to the U.S. consumer price index.\n\nThe CPI fell to 6.5% in December, the sixth straight monthly deceleration in price increases. The data convinced markets that the Federal Reserve was likely to pivot to liquidity-boosting interest rate cuts later this year.\n\nEarly this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the inflation picture and downplayed concerns of a severe tightening-induced economic slowdown, bolstering the pivot hopes.\n\nStory continues\n\nFocus on US nonfarm payrolls\n\nThe U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report scheduled for release at 13:30 UTC is likely to show the world's biggest economy added 185,000 jobs in January following December's 223,000 increase, according to Reuters estimates sourced from FXStreet.\n\nThe unemployment rate is forecast to tick slightly higher to 3.6% in January, while average hourly earnings, or wage growth, is expected to print at 4.9% year on year following December's 4.6% rise.\n\nA notable increase in average hourly earnings, a proxy for potential inflation, coupled with the headline jobs figure might see investors reconsider the possibility of the Fed keeping interest rates higher for longer and scale back bullish positioning in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\n"

Read preview\n\nA New Jersey man has admitted he tried to hire a hitman for $20,000 in Bitcoin to kill a 14-year-old boy who was going to testify against him in a child-pornography case, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nJohn Michael Musbach, 31, from Haddonfield, New Jersey, pleaded guilty in federal court to hiring a hitman to carry out a murder, according to a release by the Department of Justice.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nMusbach first encountered the boy in the summer of 2015 when the boy was 13 years old and living in New York with his parents, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The complaint alleges that Musbach and the boy exchanged sexually explicit content with each other online, including videos of themselves masturbating.\n\nThe boy's parents found out and alerted the police, who started investigating Musbach, according to the complaint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors alleged in a court filing that police discovered Musbach had Google searched a variety of alarming queries, like \"child grooming law,\" \"death by chloroform,\" \"where to buy chloroform,\" \"how to buy a gun in NJ,\" and finally, searches on how to erase his search history.\n\nIn March of 2016, authorities arrested Musbach on child pornography charges, prosecutors said in the complaint.\n\nA few months after being arrested, Musbach then \"decided to have the victim killed so that the victim could not testify against him in the pending criminal case,\" the DOJ said in a statement released Thursday. The criminal complaint states that Musbach found a murder-for-hire website on the dark web and arranged to pay $20,000 worth of Bitcoin for the murder of the victim.\n\nThe murder-for-hire service advertised itself on its website, saying \"If you want to kill someone, or to beat the shit out of him, we are the right guys ... No undercover cops here. No risks of getting caught, because we are professional killers,\" according to the complaint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Musbach asked if 14 years old was too young for the hit, the site administrator said \"14 years old is acceptable,\" according to the complaint.\n\nAfter paying up $20,000 in Bitcoin, Musbach then repeatedly messaged the service asking when the hit would be carried out, prosecutors said.\n\nEventually, the site administrator revealed that the site was a scam and threatened to turn Musbach in to law enforcement if he didn't turn over more money, according to the DOJ.\n\nMusbach allegedly responded, \"is this a joke?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe boy was never harmed, and the site did eventually turn Musbach over to authorities, prosecutors said. Musbach pleaded guilty to the murder-for-hire charges in court on Thursday, according to the DOJ.\n\nMusbach's lawyer, Rocco C. Cipparone, told Insider in a statement, \"Mr. Musbach decided to put this matter behind him without a trial, and accepted his responsibility.\"\n\nMusbach faces up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced in June."

        "title": "Here's How Much $100 In Bitcoin Could Be Worth If BTC Returns To All-Time Highs - Benzinga",
        "content": "Apex cryptocurrency Bitcoin BTC/USD remains the most valuable in the world with a market capitalization of $450 billion, more than double that of second place Ethereum. Despite the high valuation, Bitcoin is still down from all-time highs set in November 2021.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what a return to all-time highs could mean for hodlers and investors.\n\nWhat Happened: Bitcoin remains the most valuable cryptocurrency and one of the most talked about cryptocurrencies in the world. The apex crypto remains a favorite future investment option for notable investors like Cathie Wood.\n\nThe war in Ukraine led to more discussions on countries adopting Bitcoin as a currency, and some analysts have raised their price targets and bull cases for Bitcoin in the future.\n\nGlobal investment management company VanEck said money has changed due to sanctions on Russia\u2019s central bank, and the result could be traditional reserve currencies taking a backseat to Bitcoin.\n\nWood, who is the CEO of Ark Funds, has called for more companies to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. If all corporations put 1% to 10% of their cash balance into Bitcoin, the valuation of the coin could rise significantly.\n\nIn 2021, Ark Funds highlighted a $500,000 price target for Bitcoin. A bull case for Bitcoin from Ark Funds has the coin hitting $1 million per Bitcoin by 2030.\n\nArk is sticking by that price target according to its latest Big Ideas report.\n\nVanEck analysts Eric Fine and Natalia Gurushina put out a note titled \u201cHow One Bond Manager Values Gold and Bitcoin\u201d in April 2022.\n\nIn the note, the duo laid out a target price of $1.3 million to $4.8 million for Bitcoin if the cryptocurrency is adopted as a global reserve currency.\n\nRelated Link: How To Buy Bitcoin\n\nInvesting $100 in Bitcoin: A $100 investment in Bitcoin today could buy 0.00429 BTC, based on a current price of $23,349.88 at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin hit an all-time high of $68,789.63 in November 2021. The coin failed to reach a price of $69,420, a figure that some suggested could break the internet, combining two of the most popular memeable numbers.\n\nIf Bitcoin returns to an all-time high, a $100 investment today would be worth $295.11. This would represent a return of 195.1%.\n\nWhile Bitcoin may never reach the $500,000 or $1 million price targets from Ark Invest, a return to all-time highs could be more likely. Those who have followed cryptocurrency for years know that there are many waves and cycles that happen, and Bitcoin could hit new all-time highs during the next bull run.\n\nRead Next: Exclusive: Will Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum Or Solana Gain More In 2023, 39% Of Benzinga Followers Said This"

        "title": "Bitcoin NFT Mints Are Rising\u2014But So Are Transaction Fees - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOrdinals, a controversial new project that lets users put NFT-like media assets on the Bitcoin blockchain, is seeing surging activity this week. On Thursday, Ordinals recorded its largest number of single-day mints\u2014but network fees are apparently growing as a result.\n\nMore than 1,000 total Bitcoin NFTs have been minted via Ordinals, according to public blockchain data curated by Dune, topping that total on Thursday as 420 new \u201cinscriptions\u201d were made on the blockchain. That\u2019s more than three times the amount of NFTs minted on Bitcoin via the process on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, Thursday also marked the highest average transaction fee on Bitcoin in more than a month, landing at $1.53 worth of BTC per data from YCharts. That\u2019s the highest it\u2019s been since December 27, 2022\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImage: Dune Analytics\n\nThe launch of Ordinals revived the heated and long-standing debate in the Bitcoin space about block sizes, legitimate transactions, and whether JPEGs and other media should be inscribed on the original blockchain. Thanks to the Taproot upgrade, Ordinals has allowed anything from knock-off Bored Apes to video games to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nNFTs are digital assets that are provably unique and linked to digital (and sometimes even physical) content like artwork, movies, and music files, and they can prove ownership of an item or membership in an exclusive group.\n\nWhile blockchains like Ethereum and Solana are synonymous with NFTs, the practice of committing digital assets to a blockchain network has existed on Bitcoin since 2014, with projects like Counterparty and Stacks leading the way.\n\ntl;dr after digging into the Ordinals \"spam\" debacle: 1) This has been possible since SegWit\n\n2) Taproot didn't enable this, it just made it (very) slightly easier and cheaper\n\n3) Prepare for the FUD as proponents of Bitcoin's early ossification try to weaponize this w/o nuance \u2014 Seth For Privacy (@sethforprivacy) February 3, 2023\n\nRising transaction fees are an apparent side effect of adding NFTs to Bitcoin\u2019s mainnet. Bitcoin transaction fees are determined by the volume of data in the transaction and the speed at which the user wants their transaction completed. Users who want their transactions to go through during periods of high traffic can decide to pay more fees to push their transactions through.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn January 21, when Ordinals launched, Bitcoin transaction fees topped out at 2.10% as a percentage of the block reward for miners\u2014but on January 24, Bitcoin fees topped out at 3.44%, according to data from Hashrate Index. On Thursday, that figure reached 3.86%.\n\nA closer look at the Hashrate Index data shows that the percentage is spiking at times during the day, including to a mark of nearly 8% late Friday afternoon. However, the overall daily average has thus far landed at a much lower number amid the rise of Ordinals.\n\nThe increase in transaction fees has led some Bitcoin maximalists to call Ordinals an affront to the Bitcoin ethos. Others say the project allows the spamming of the decentralized network.\n\nWe can have NFTs and collectables on Bitcoin without spamming/attacking the network. Taproot actually makes this even easier; the \"tapscript\" could be a new kind that refers to a torrent magnet instead of a script, and the spend on-chain doesn't need to add any data. \u2014 @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) February 3, 2023\n\nIt's sentiment that Ordinals developer Casey Rodarmor does not share. He told Decrypt on Monday that Bitcoin blocks need to be full to give users a reason to pay more than the minimum fee.\n\n\u201cIf blocks are not full, then nobody has any reason to pay more than the minimum fee rate to have their transactions included in a block,\u201d he said. \u201cSo as a result, blocks must be full.\"\n\nHe further explained that while he's keen on full Bitcoin blocks, he does not support increasing the size of the blocks. \"I wouldn\u2019t advocate to raise the block size,\u201d he affirmed.\n\nEven so, Ordinals are apparently affecting how people use the Bitcoin network, which may only fuel the continuing debate around their value and use.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has described fiat currency as being in serious \u201cjeopardy\u201d as an effective store of wealth but doesn\u2019t believe Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins will be the solution either.\n\nThe founder of hedge fund firm Bridgewater Associates explained on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box on Feb. 2 that the mass money printing of the United States dollar and other reserve currencies has him questioning whether they are forms of \u201ceffective money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in a world in which money as we know it is in jeopardy. We are printing too much, and it\u2019s not just the United States, it is all the reserve currencies.\u201d\n\nHowever, Dalio was quick to add his thoughts on whether Bitcoin was a potential solution, acknowledging that despite what it has accomplished in \u201c12 years,\u201d it is still too volatile to serve as money:\n\n\"It's not going to be an effective money. It's not an effective store holder of wealth. It's not an effective medium of exchange,\" he argued.\n\nHe also dismissed stablecoins as an effective form of money, as they are replica of state-backed fiat currency.\n\nInstead, Dalio proposed the creation of an \u201cinflation-linked coin\u201d that would serve to ensure consumers secure their buying power.\n\n\u201cThe closest thing to that is an inflation index bond, but if you created a coin that says OK this is buying power that I know I can save in and put my money in over a period of time and transact in anywhere, I think that would be a good coin,\u201d he said.\n\n\"#Bitcoin has no relation to anything.

I don\u2019t think Bitcoin is it,\" he added.\n\nHowever, not everyone agreed with Dalio\u2019s take on Bitcoin and the viability of an inflation-linked coin.\n\nDigital asset manager Eric Weiss of Bitcoin for Family Officers was one, telling his 38,300 Twitter followers that such a coin could not exist:\n\n\u201cAccording to Ray, [Bitcoin] is very close to being the solution to the world\u2019s problems but it\u2019s too volatile. He's waiting for and vaguely describes a solution that doesn\u2019t and can\u2019t exist,\" said Weiss.\n\nARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood also had a different view of Bitcoin, referring to it as a defense against wealth confiscation in parts of the developing world:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m struck that the market is now leading the Fed,\u201d @ARKinvest Founder @CathieDWood says on bond market downtrends.https://t.co/DDNw4dbOPD pic.twitter.com/AAS0UWf0kh \u2014 Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) February 2, 2023\n\n\u201cThose populations need a fallback, an insurance policy like Bitcoin,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated: Crypto-friendly Ray Dalio steps back from Bridgewater\u2019s $150M fund\n\nDalio\u2019s latest views on Bitcoin come despite once having labeled it \u201cone hell of an invention\u201d that could serve as a viable inflation hedge. However, these remarks were made on Jan. 28, 2021 \u2014 before the current bear market took effect.\n\nThe billionaire investor has also previously recommended BTC should make up 1-2% of an investors portfolio on Jan. 6, 2022.\n\nAs an investment product, the hedge fund manager said back in May 2021 that he would rather buy BTC over bonds but stated a few months later that he still prefers gold.\n\nOn Oct. 4, Dalio stepped down as Bridgewater\u2019s co-chief investment officer, but he remained on board as a mentor."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBillionaire investor and Bitcoin fan Tim Draper made a surprise visit to the headquarters of Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank trying to promote the cryptocurrency as a tool to fight corruption, but faced a frosty reception from the bank's Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe, per a Bloomberg report.\n\n\u201cI come to the Central Bank with decentralized currency,\u201d Draper said, only for Weerasinghe to bluntly respond, \u201cWe don\u2019t accept.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdoption of 100% Bitcoin won\u2019t be a Sri Lanka reality ever,\u201d Weerasinghe said, adding that, \"we don\u2019t want to make the crisis worse by introducing Bitcoin.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring his meeting with Weerasinghe, Draper, dressed in a Bitcoin tie, said that should Sri Lanka follow El Salvador's lead in making use of Bitcoin, \"A country known for corruption will be able to keep perfect records with the adoption of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Governor, however, having its own currency is necessary for Sri Lanka's monetary policy independence, and other technologies are capable of distributing financial services.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis\n\nThe meeting came during Draper\u2019s visit to the island nation this week to shoot an episode of his \"Meet the Drapers\" TV show with local entrepreneurs. During his stay, Draper also met the country\u2019s president Ranil Wickremesinghe, where he again made the case for Bitcoin adoption in Sri Lanka.\n\nSri Lanka, which marks the 75th anniversary of its independence from Great Britain this year, is engulfed in a major economic and political crisis that saw it default on more than $56 billion of foreign loans in 2022. The country is facing fuel and food shortages that lead to mass protests and forced former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign,\n\nSystemic corruption is believed to be one of the reasons for Sri Lanka\u2019s descent into chaos; however, those ruling the country today appear to be opposed to introducing Bitcoin as a possible solution.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2014, Draper bought 30,000 BTC\u2014then worth $19 million\u2014seized from the dark web drug marketplace Silk Road in an auction held by the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nThat same year, he predicted the price of Bitcoin would go to $10,000 in three years. Bitcoin went on to surpass $20,000 in 2017.\n\nHowever, not all of Draper's predictions have come to pass. In 2018, he argued that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by 2022; by November 2022, as the crypto space entered into a prolonged bear market, he \"extended\" his prediction by six months, claiming that \"by mid-2023, I'm expecting to see Bitcoin hit $250,000.\""

        "content": "In a new interview on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, hedge fund veteran Ray Dalio says Bitcoin (BTC) is getting more attention than it deserves.\n\nThe founder of asset management firm Bridgewater Associates says that what Bitcoin accomplished in the last 12 years is amazing, but investors still have better choices than putting their money on the benchmark cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tiny thing that gets disproportionate attention. You know the value of Bitcoin is less than a third of the value of Microsoft stock. You can go into industries. Biotech and many other industries are more interesting than Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nDalio says that Bitcoin falls short as an effective asset, but traditional money also has its own problems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be an effective money, not an effective store hold of wealth or effective medium of exchange, but we\u2019re in a world in which money as we know it is in jeopardy.\n\nWe\u2019re printing too much and it is not just the United States, all the reserve currencies\u2014what is going on in Euro, what is going on in Yen, so in that world, the question is what is money and how is that going to operate.\n\nI think the question over the next number of years is really what is money, not just as a medium of exchange, but as a store hold of wealth.\u201d\n\nHe says that an inflation-linked coin that gives its owner buying power would make a good digital asset.\n\n\u201cIf you want a digital currency, you have to do things differently. I don\u2019t think that stablecoins are good because you\u2019re getting fiat currency again. What would be best is an inflation-linked coin. In other words, something where basically you would say this is going to give me buying power because every individual wants to secure their buying power.\n\nIf you put it in Bitcoin, it goes like this, who knows what happens?\n\nIf you create a coin that says this is buying power that I know I can save in and put my money in over a period of time and I can transact anywhere, I think that that would be a good coin.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Genesis Upgrade: Bitcoin's rebirth - CoinGeek",
        "content": "February 4 is a special day for Bitcoin, but only those in the Bitcoin SV (BSV) ecosystem fully understand why.\n\nWhile the original Bitcoin protocol was released on January 3, 2009, with the infamous and much-misunderstood Times headline in its Genesis block, those familiar with Bicoin\u2019s history will be all too aware that the original Bitcoin lost its way, or more accurately, was deliberately driven off the rails by a shadowy cabal with an agenda.\n\nWhat was designed as an infinitely scalable peer-to-peer electronic cash system was hijacked by a group of ideologically driven and corrupt developers in the pocket of Silicon Valley VCs and big data monopolies who wanted nothing more than to stop the Bitcoin protocol in its tracks.\n\nPretty soon, BTC became little more than a glorified pyramid scheme, pumped to unimaginable heights by fake United States dollar derivatives such as USDT as a propaganda machine that would have made Joseph Goebbels proud. The masses were convinced they could become rich by \u201cHODLing\u201d BTC, which, from a protocol perspective, was no longer Bitcoin at all.\n\nYet, Bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, wasn\u2019t going to let the invention he had worked on for decades die so easily. After being outed as Satoshi by Wired and Gizmodo, Australian entrepreneur Dr. Craig Wright gradually started to take back control of Bitcoin. This ultimately led to Bitcoin\u2019s second Genesis on February 4, 2020.\n\nA second chance to build a Bitcoin-powered world\n\nIt\u2019s an old saying that there are no second chances in life, but like all old sayings, there are exceptions. Thankfully, the original Bitcoin is alive and well, and with the Genesis protocol upgrade, its original capabilities were restored. Thanks to Bitcoin\u2019s second Genesis, led by its inventor and the true believers in the original protocol, we have a second chance to build a Bitcoin world.\n\nWith the return to unbounded block sizes determined by free market economics, alongside the reactivation of many of Bitcoin\u2019s original capabilities, including the ability to use so-called smart contracts to create applications on the blockchain, Bitcoiners were given another chance to create the world they originally envisioned before Blockstream, Digital Currency Group, and others seized control.\n\nWhat sort of world is this? A world where true peer-to-peer transactions are possible, where unlimited transactions can be sent and received globally in seconds for fractions of a cent, and in which micropayments power new economies and unlock new business models.\n\nThe bigger picture is that the very internet itself will be transformed as the parasitic middlemen and data extractors are stripped of their power, and the original dream of the internet pioneers comes true. Metanet will see the web powered by micropayments with true data ownership and sovereignty returned to the people, solving many of the problems created by how the internet works today.\n\nUltimately, everything will change in a Bitcoin-powered world. Nothing will be the same, and in a few decades, historians will look back and see just how monumental an event the return to Genesis was.\n\nWhile February 4 may only be celebrated by a relative handful of BSV supporters today, it will be remembered as the second most important day in Bitcoin\u2019s history. 11 years, one month, and one day after the original Genesis block came the restoration of the original creation and the resetting of the foundation upon which the new world will be built.\n\nLet\u2019s take the time to celebrate what has been achieved so far while we dream, build, and create the future!\n\nWatch: A World of Good\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Bitcoin price is still trending comfortably above the $23,000 level as it maintains its bullish trend. This has continued for a couple of weeks now, propelled forward by the newly adopted dovish stance of the United States Federal Reserve. However, not all investors have embraced this bullish trend as many still expect a decline in price for the digital asset.\n\nBitcoin Price Could Trade At $20,000 Soon\n\nAccording to the Price Estimates feature on Coinmarketcap, a good number of investors are expecting a bearish reversal for the bitcoin price. Price Estimates is a feature on the data aggregator website that allows individual users to put in their price expectations and then gives an estimate of all of the predictions.\n\nIn the current round of forecasts, the bearish sentiment surrounding the digital asset seems to be heightened as the median estimations came out to a price of $20,000. If this plays out, then the price of bitcoin could reach this level by the end of February according to the Price Estimates feature. It would also be a 14.69% drop from the current price.\n\nBTC price estimates puts it over 14% lower | Source: Coinmarketcap\n\nInterestingly, the bearish expectations are not just limited to the month of February alone but span over the next five months. The median of 8,053 votes came out to a price estimate of $19,500 for the month of March, $18,426 across 5,294 votes for the month of April, $17,6660 across 3,617 votes for the month of May, and $18,555 across 2,161 votes for the month June.\n\nOwe 34,000 votes have been collected in total by the Price Estimates feature and the estimation average came out to $20,203.57 across all of the votes. The median estimate was much worse at a price of $19,659.\n\nBTC price recovers above $23,500 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nBTC Price Still Shows Strong Fundamentals\n\nPresently, while there have been speculations that the current upward movement of bitcoin is a bull trap, the digital asset is still showing strong fundamentals which suggest the price may continue to rise. One of these is that cryptocurrency is still trading well above all important moving averages.\n\nThe digital asset has now established support right above $23,000 which means that the bulls are still well in control. The $24,000 may have been elusive but bitcoin still maintains enough momentum for a retest. In the last 24 hours, it has seen trading volumes above $29 billion. As long as the bulls can hold the bitcoin price above $23,000 going into the weekend, the possibility of a crash remains slim.\n\nBTC is currently trading at just Aviv $23,400 at the time of this writing. It is down 1.53% in the last 24 hours but is seeing gains of 2.08% in the last seven days.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from Forbes, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nOn Episode 4 of the CoinGeek Weekly Livestream, Kurt Wuckert Jr. talks to Darren Kellenschwiler, also known as Deggen on YouTube, about building on Bitcoin. Kellenschwiler is the Chief Technical Officer at Elas and the Developers Community Manager of the BSV Blockchain Association.\n\nOrdinals on BTC\n\nWuckert asks Kellenschwiler if he\u2019s up to speed on the Ordinals NFT situation on BTC. He says he is not and asks what it\u2019s all about.\n\nWuckert explains that a developer has created a protocol scheme to turn individual satoshis into non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\n\u201cIt has broken the internet,\u201d he says, noting that the whole point of the Bitcoin civil war was to prevent this sort of thing. However, this developer has figured out a way to put image-based NFTs on BTC, deeply upsetting the small-blocker maximalists who claim Bitcoin is under attack.\n\nKellenschwiler says he has been working on a token platform that, conceptually, will be very similar. It\u2019s called Buzzmint.\n\nUnlike BTC fanatics, BSVers have no problem with useful token platforms. He speaks about how easy it is to develop applications on Bitcoin now, thanks to indexing services like JungleBus. Services like this will allow people to focus on their businesses rather than running nodes, the two agree.\n\nKellenschwilers\u2019 Bitcoin story\n\nWuckert always asks guests what their Bitcoin story is, and so he urges Kellenschwiler to tell his.\n\n\u201c2013-ish,\u201d Kellenschwiler replies, remembering how he heard about it from an engineer friend in England. At first, he dismissed it as \u201cinternet POGs,\u201d but after growing interested in how economics and money work, he started day trading Bitcoin and ended up selling a business and putting all of his cash into it.\n\nEventually, Kellenschwiler started coding and tinkering with Bitcoin applications. He moved to London and began traveling to events. These days, he works for Elas and is developing applications related to Metanet, among other things.\n\nIn the immediate future, Kellenschwiler is excited to attend the London Blockchain Conference. He\u2019s also interested in creating BSV meetups in Austin, where he\u2019s currently based.\n\nOn LiteClient\n\nWuckert recalls the excitement when LiteClient was first announced. However, he feels there\u2019s a huge lack of clarity about what it is, who would run it, etc. He asks Kellenschwiler to clarify and explain his participation in creating it.\n\nThe main pushback is from developers who are so used to running full nodes that they\u2019re \u201creluctant to even consider that running a Merkle root is as secure as all of the data in the entire block,\u201d Kellenschwiler says. \u201cThat\u2019s the main concept people don\u2019t get.\u201d\n\nExchanges and wallet developers are particularly reluctant to accept it, but application developers are far ahead.\n\nWuckert recalls a conversation with Dr. Craig Wright in Oslo in which he explained that, when everyone runs nodes, this simply replaces the Byzantine Generals Problem, which proof-of-work solved for a \u201cByzantine soldiers problem.\u201d There are so many more of them, and it\u2019s much harder to coordinate them, Wuckert notes, recalling how he had a lightbulb moment when Dr. Wright said it.\n\nWhat\u2019s coming for LiteClient in the future? Kellenschwiler thinks it will change how transactions are broadcast to the network. At the moment, most app builders will use a merchant API, but these will soon be replaced by new apps that give extra features, such as guarantees of broadcast acceptance. Long-term, the future of LiteClient is IPv6, multicast, and much more. This will all make the Bitcoin economy more efficient.\n\nViewer questions and answers\n\nQ. Why are edges important when programming in Bitcoin?\n\n\u201cImagine the infrastructure that supports the internet at the moment,\u201d Kellenschwiler says, painting a picture of the massive server farms that hold it all together. In a Bitcoin-powered world with multicast and IPv6, this will move toward the edges. It\u2019s not like that now because it\u2019s difficult to monetize, whereas Bitcoin allows us to monetize every packet.\n\nQ. What\u2019s the latest on the COPA case? What cases will we see next?\n\nIt\u2019s in \u201csomething of a holding pattern,\u201d Wuckert says. He has heard that the Kleiman case will go back to judge Bruce Reinhart, who notoriously dislikes Dr. Wright, but he doesn\u2019t have any further information right now.\n\nWatch: London Blockchain Conference 2023 \u2013 Bringing government and enterprise onto the blockchain\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

Furthermore, you will get free daily bonuses, which means that coming back to gamble on a daily basis is a good deal.\n\nCrash Gambling \u2013 What Are the Rules\n\nThis game is loosely based on the concept of trading and caters to players that enjoy that kind of thing. The action involves a graph with a line that constantly goes up. While this occurs the odds for withdrawing go up and you can cash out at any point. However, eventually the game will crash and players that have not cashed out before this happens will lose the wager.\n\nTherefore, it is a risk and reward gameplay mechanic. To win money players need to be patient and wait for the odds to increase so the winnings are higher. However, if they get too greedy, then the entire wager will be lost due to the game crashing.\n\nAt the time of writing, crash is not one of the easiest gaming options to find online because the top software providers have not developed it. For example, you will not find it available from industry-leading software companies like Microgaming and NetEnt.\n\nWhat Are the Game Odds\n\nThe game odds are usually set on the casino or website where you are playing. Therefore, they can be different and you need to adjust your strategy. Ideally, you will find a website that offers the best gambling odds by reducing the house edge.\n\nKeep in mind that many crash games have a mechanic of around 1% chance to instantly crash when the game starts. This means that no matter what you do, there is no chance of winning money for that round.\n\nNote that the odds on the betting line start small and increase rapidly over time. You will start at 1x and potentially end up at 10x, which means that you can cash out for 10 times the wager amount.\n\nWhat Are Crash Game Payouts Like\n\nThis section covers topics that relate to the payouts and multipliers within the game. Note that these are just a rule of thumb. The actual details of the action will be different for each caisno where you are playing. Therefore, make sure to read the terms and conditions to ensure you have the relevant information.\n\nGame rules: the game starts when you wager an amount of money. The amount that you can bet will be based on where you are playing. There might be a minimum and a maximum amount that you can wager. Once you have placed a bet the action starts and the point on the betting line goes up. This increases the odds and the game ends when you cash out or the game crashes, and you lose the entire wager.\n\nThe multiplier: these are the chances of cash out odds as the game changes. So the action starts at 1x and it may increase to a 2x multiplier incrementally or it will jump there in one go. Each casino creates different multipliers so you will need to play to figure out what you will face. Note that the idea is to get the highest multiplier to win the most cash possible.\n\nThe minimum and the maximum crash point: this is the range of multipliers where the game can crash. The house edge typically works by creating a crash point immediately after the game starts. The maximum crash point is the higher possible multiplier for the game. You can risk your wager by waiting for the betting line to reach this number, but there is a high chance of the game going bust before that happens.\n\nThe minimum cash out: this refers to the smallest multiplier that you can hit to get your wager back and winnings. Most games provide a minimum cash out point that is around 2x, which means you will get double your wager. However, this is not set in stone and will be different at each casino. You could use a strategy where you always try to hit the minimum cash out to keep the risk low.\n\nCrash Betting Games Based on Currency\n\nThis section shares the various currencies that can be used when enjoying this game. You will see that the game can be played in a variety of ways to suit your needs. Being aware of the options allows you to get the most out of the experience.\n\nCS:GO Crash Gambling\n\nSkins: one of the best ways to show off in CSGO is by sharing a rare skin. These are essentially cosmetics that change the look of your character. The rarity of skins varies from common all the way to rare. You can win skins from the crash game and the rarity of the skin increases as you increase the risks by waiting for the betting line to increase.\n\nCases: the cases in CSGO have a weapon inside them that are locked. Opening a case provides a new weapon, that also have different rarities. They are usually dropped in game as a random item or you can win them from mission rewards. However, they are also used as the payout option in crash gambling. This means you can win cool new weapons using this method, which might be faster than grinding for them in-game.\n\nLoot boxes: as the name suggests, these items are boxes that when opened provide some loot. The item that is received is random and the chance of getting something rare is low. The odds that you have for getting each item in a loot pool are shared online since this is required by law for transparency reasons. You can win loot boxes by playing crash and the number of loot boxes that you receive increases with the multiplier.\n\nCrypto Crash Gambling\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC): these are arguably 2 of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the planet. Many casinos where crash bitcoin game is available provide cryptocurrency as a means of gambling. It\u2019s a good option because you can deposit funds anonymously and withdraw them the same way. However, the price of these cryptocurrencies fluctuates daily so you need to be aware of this when figuring out your gambling strategy.\n\nEthereum (ETH): this cryptocurrency take around 7.5 days to mine and you can use it to gamble on crash. For example, one casino allows you to fuel a rocket with Ether, which makes it increase on the betting line. However, at any moment it can crash and that will result in a loss of all the Ether that was used to fuel the rocket.\n\nEOS/USDT: this refers to cryptocurrencies on the Binance blockchain. They can also be used to wager on crash gambling, which provides holders of these coins to get involved. However, this is not as widely available as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Therefore, you need to check with the casino where you are applying to ensure that it is an option open to players.\n\nCoin Crash Gambling Canada\n\nYou can also gamble with FIAT money using popular currencies like Euros, USD and British Pound Sterling. These currencies are available at many casinos where you can use to deposit and withdraw with several methods.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that some casinos only support crypto-based currencies. This means that currencies like USD or EUR cannot be used for depositing to the cashier and betting. This might be because the financial infrastructure for supporting crypto and FIAT currencies are different.\n\nWhat Crash Gambling Game Should You Choose\n\nWith so many varieties of the game you need to decide on what version to play. First, choose a currency that matches your available funds. For example, if you hold crypto then choose a coin that you have and are familiar with. On the other hand, if you are a fan of CSGO, then you can try out that version to win skins, cases and loot boxes.\n\nA good idea would be to try out the various options at each casino for yourself to see how they are different. Through trial and error you can find one version that you like the best ad provides the most fun.\n\nHow to Start Playing at a Crash Casino\n\nTo get started you will need to register for a new account.

However, many casinos are aware of this and implement security measures to protect your funds. They are different for every casino so you will need to read the rules where you are playing. You may find that once you have reconnected the game was paused and you can reconnect at any time.\n\nStrategies to Try in Crash Gambling\n\nIt is a good idea to consider different strategies and here are the popular ones:\n\nAutomatic cashout: you can use a function to trigger an automatic cashout when a specific multiplier is hit. This is a great way to ensure that you keep control of the action and don\u2019t increase the risk too much.\n\nThe Martingale strategy: this tactic involves increasing the size of bets when you lose in the hopes that you recoup your initial investment. However, it can get risky when the betting size becomes very big.\n\nThe Fibonacci strategy: this strategy involves a specific sequence that takes place over 10 rounds. The strategy involves creating odds that roughly have a 50/50 chance of winning. Over the 10 rounds the betting sizes are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2 and 3.\n\nThe Anti-Martingale strategy: this strategy involves you doubling bets that win and reducing bets after losses.\n\nPromotions and Vip Programs\n\nMany crash gambling casinos provide bonuses for new players. This means that there is an incentive to join new casino to take advantage of these offers. You will need to consider the bonus code when registering for a new account and making a deposit. Also, daily bonuses might be offered to keep you coming back in the hopes of extra rewards.\n\nAlso, look for casinos where you can enjoy a VIP program. These usually deliver loyalty points that can be redeemed for cash to use for betting. It provides players with extra reasons to play at one casino.\n\nAmount Limits and Time\n\nWhen playing a game of crash there might be an upper limit in terms of what multipliers can be triggered. This means there is a maximum amount that you can win. When this upper limit is reached, then the cashout will be automatic.\n\nAlso, the amount of time that you can play each round depends on when the game crashes. This might be shortly after starting or when you cash out. The decision is up to you regarding how much time you want to risk.\n\nPlaying the Roobet Crash Game\n\nIn this section, we outline the process of how to play the Roobet version:\n\nGet a secure VPN: you may need a VPN to start playing the game. This allows you to change the connection to a different country so that you can get around the restrictions list.\n\nSign up for Roobet: start by completing the sign up process, which takes just a few minutes.

        "title": "US billionaire calls Sri Lanka 'corrupt' then offers Bitcoin fix - The Straits Times",
        "content": "BENGALURU \u2013 A billionaire cryptocurrency evangelist may have had a tougher reception than he expected when proposing widespread adoption of Bitcoin to a bankrupt country.\n\nSilicon Valley investor Tim Draper was in Sri Lanka to shoot an episode of his Meet The Drapers TV show with local entrepreneurs, and met President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday to proselytise the adoption of cryptocurrency. He journeyed to the central bank the next day with the same pitch \u2013 but embattled governor Nandalal Weerasinghe, who is still working to calm financial mayhem, was having none of it.\n\n\u201cI come to the central bank with decentralised currency,\u201d proclaimed Mr Draper, dressed in a Bitcoin tie for the meeting.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t accept,\u201d Mr Weerasinghe said.\n\nIt was a frostier response than Mr Draper had received in some other locations. The tiny island country of Palau in the Pacific made him the founding resident of its digital residency programme, for instance.\n\nFuel and food shortages in Sri Lanka stirred riots last year that forced the then president to flee the country and later resign. The debt-stricken nation is in talks with international creditors about debt restructuring, aiming to get the International Monetary Fund to come up with a rescue plan. Inflation stands at 54.2 per cent and last year, the economy contracted 8 per cent, Mr Weerasinghe said.\n\nTo crypto enthusiasts, that might seem like the perfect place for Bitcoin adoption. One of the main uses that people see for crypto is as a steady store of value not subject to changes in central bank or government policy. Mr Draper even cited El Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, in the meeting. But experiences like El Salvador\u2019s, which staved off default at the last minute in January, might serve as a cautionary tale more than anything.\n\nMr Draper, 64, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and early backer of companies such as Tesla, Baidu, Skype, Coinbase and Robinhood, made news in 2014 when he purchased seized Bitcoin at a United States Marshals Service auction. Bitcoin is hovering in the low US$20,000 region \u2014 but he sees the cryptocurrency reaching US$250,000 (S$328,000) in 2023.\n\nHe kept trying in the meeting with Mr Weerasinghe. \u201cDoes the administration have the guts to do it?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat is the advantage of having your own currency?\u201d\n\nFurther, Mr Draper said he was \u201ca little worried about you guys\u201d, and that the financial crisis provided a window of opportunity for a country \u201cknown as the corruption capital\u201d. Colombo could avert graft by keeping perfect records after adopting Bitcoin, he argued.\n\nMr Weerasinghe said other technologies could efficiently distribute financial services to foster inclusion and disburse electronic welfare payments, and noted that a country without its own currency could not have monetary policy independence.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to make the crisis worse by introducing Bitcoin,\u201d he said.

        "title": "Bitcoin Resurgence Brings Back Old Phenomenon of Wild Weekends - BNN Bloomberg",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amid this year\u2019s rally, Bitcoin has resumed one of its old habits: it\u2019s back to posting big moves on weekends, a phenomenon that\u2019s become an intriguing characteristic of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nTake last Sunday, when it gained 3.4%, a similar amount to what it notched the Saturday on the weekend prior. And the Saturday before that, the coin advanced 5.5%.\n\nThat Bitcoin posts large moves is nothing new. But the token, like all other cryptocurrencies, trades around the clock, every day of the week, counter to most other assets, which tend to trade Monday through Friday on regulated exchanges. And it\u2019s been seen in crypto markets in the past, with Bitcoin shooting higher \u2014 or posting big down days \u2014 while other assets are taking a rest from work.\n\nThe most compelling theory on the strong weekend moves might be that liquidity is thinner, meaning that price swings on large orders can be more pronounced, says Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto Is Macro Now\u201d newsletter. Liquidity has been thinner for Bitcoin recently, with traders and investors staying on the sidelines and hodlers hodling, she says.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of the year, volatility has picked up \u2014 still not at \u2018normal\u2019 levels, but getting there,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cThis should herald the return of the weekend phenomenon, with lower weekend liquidity leading to stronger moves as traders and investors tentatively come back into the market.\u201d\n\nCrypto tokens have skyrocketed at the start of the year as other riskier assets like stocks also rise and as investors look ahead through the remainder of 2023, when they expect the Federal Reserve to dial back in its monetary policy hawkishness. Bitcoin has risen roughly 40%, bringing its losses from its November 2021 all-time high to around 60%. Ether, the second-largest by market value, has rallied a similar amount.\n\nBut, given the troubles that plagued the digital-assets space all of last year \u2014 including the downfall of a number of previously-grand projects like trading platform FTX \u2014 investors have largely shied away amid the turmoil. Trading volumes remain in the gutter: the hundreds of exchanges worldwide \u2014 clocking in at 650, according to CoinGecko \u2014 have recently been seeing 24-hour trading volumes of around $100 billion, compared with more than $200 billion in November 2021. Thinner volumes can, therefore, exacerbate any weekend price moves.\n\nStill, no one knows for certain why crypto prices go berserk on weekends. A similar phenomenon \u2014 sometimes dubbed the overnight effect \u2014 can be found with stocks, too.\n\n\u201cCompanies release a lot of information after the markets close because they want people to have time to digest it \u2014 and by the time you come in the next morning, you have a chance to say, OK what\u2019s the impact of that news,\u201d said Kara Murphy, chief investment officer at Kestra Investment Management. \u201cAnd some of that could be true in the crypto space where people are maybe waiting to release information on a Friday evening so that you have the weekend to digest it. That would be the fundamental explanation for why that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nChris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank who oversees a currencies desk, attributes yet another potential reason: less dependence on institutional buying in crypto compared with traditional markets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of the individuals,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cFor that reason, you could see wider swings on the weekends just because it is just individuals trading.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Lu Wang.\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."

However, based on what we gathered from its official website, Bitcoin Prime was developed and is owned by a team of professional traders and software developers. These individuals reportedly have decades of experience in the financial market, indicating that they are keen on ensuring the robot is at its best performance.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin Prime owners stay abreast with the latest trends and developments in the cryptocurrency market to gain insights into the market performance. This is so that they can ensure the robot identifies trends with more profitability and enhances its capability in managing cryptocurrency trades. Plus, the bot\u2019s owners partner with regulated platforms, making it legit and safe to trade with.\n\nGetting Started With Bitcoin Prime\n\nGetting started with Bitcoin Prime is easy, and it will only take you a few minutes to have everything set up. Here is a brief overview of how to create a trading account and trade with Bitcoin Prime.\n\nRegister for a Trading Account\n\nAt the top right corner of the Bitcoin Prime page, there is a form to fill out to begin your account setup. This procedure takes less than five minutes to complete.\n\nDeposit Funds\n\nBitcoin Prime has a minimum deposit requirement of $250. To begin your cryptocurrency trading ventures, you will deposit these funds via its affiliated brokers who are believed to be highly regulated and safe.\n\nTrade\n\nIt's a no-brainer that Bitcoin Prime is a trading robot in the cryptocurrency space. Therefore, once you make your deposit and set up the robot, it will automatically start executing trades based on market conditions. With a 90% claimed win rate, your chances of tripling your capital are maximised.\n\nBitcoin Prime Markets, Assets, and Options\n\nWhat cryptocurrencies and products can you trade using Bitcoin Prime?\n\nThe Bitcoin Prime trading platform lets you trade Bitcoin and other altcoins, including Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, and Ripple. Simply put, you have access to more than 14 cryptocurrencies, all of which you can also trade as CFDs. Unfortunately, the robot doesn't have any other trading options/markets. For instance, if you also venture into stocks and forex, you may want to consider other automated platforms.\n\nRemember, Bitcoin Prime features are user-friendly. So whether you are a beginner with zero experience in the crypto market or an expert trader looking for a better trading bot, it is suitable for your trading needs.\n\nWhat leverage trading options are available with the Bitcoin Prime app?\n\nThe robot works with regulated brokers in the cryptocurrency industry to offer investors up to 3000:1 leverage to magnify small trades. The company states that its high leverage is the main factor in the high return rate they offer to small investors. So, how does Bitcoin Prime work? Well, with 3000:1 leverage, if you invest $250, you can potentially borrow $750k to make crypto investments. This is relatively high compared to other Bitcoin trading platforms.\n\nHowever, you should remember that leveraged trading presents a significant amount of additional risk if you are inexperienced. Therefore, we recommend only investing what you can afford while you are a beginner.\n\nWhat are the spreads?\n\nThe spreads on Bitcoin Prime will change depending on which broker you are dealing with. In addition, because the market is quite volatile, you can expect some fluctuation between the buying and selling price of Bitcoin.\n\nFees, Limits, and Payment Options on Bitcoin Prime\n\nHow much does Bitcoin Prime cost?\n\nNote that there are no other fees attached to Bitcoin Prime besides the minimum deposit requirement and the 2% commission on profits made. For instance, this robot has a free account and there are no sign-up or subscription fees. In addition, you do not need to buy the robot since it is free to download. However, you cannot trade using Bitcoin Prime trading system without making the required deposit. Luckily, the bot has deposit bonuses from time to time, so always be on the lookout for these to maximise your experience.\n\nWe understand that some cryptocurrency traders are budget-conscious and might be skeptical of taking the plunge without understanding the robot. Fortunately, Bitcoin Prime has a demo account besides the live version to test the robot and practise how to navigate the cryptocurrency market without spending your hard-earned money.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: 2% on profits earned \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: Up to 10 free withdrawals per calendar month \ud83d\udcb0 Software cost: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Subscription cost: Zero\n\nWhat are the payment methods accepted by Bitcoin Prime?\n\nBitcoin Prime trading platform offers numerous payment methods to make investments. These include:\n\nPayPal\n\nMastercard\n\nVisa\n\nAnd many others\n\nDoes Bitcoin Prime also charge fees and commissions?\n\nAs we have previously mentioned, you do not have to pay any fees to open your Bitcoin Prime account. In addition, you also do not have to pay any fees to make a deposit. Therefore, the only time you will ever have to give money to Bitcoin Prime is when you pay a commission from your trade profits.\n\nBitcoin Prime trade sizes and limits\n\nAs aforementioned, Bitcoin Prime requires all users to pay a minimum deposit of $250 when creating their account. This is also the minimum amount you can invest to trade Bitcoin. Additionally, Bitcoin Prime does not have a maximum limit on how much you can spend, though we recommend starting small to avoid falling into financial difficulty.\n\nBitcoin Prime Platform\n\nHow does Bitcoin Prime work?\n\nThe Bitcoin Prime platform is an easy-to-use auto trading system that allows investors to trade cryptocurrency and potentially earn passive income.\n\nInterestingly, it is one of few auto-trading systems in the market that claims to apply AI to exclusively trading BTC contracts for differences (CFDs).\n\nUtilising sophisticated technology, Bitcoin Prime\u2019s auto trading robots reportedly analyse the current Bitcoin market to find the best investments for their users. Then, trading robots will invest the funds deposited in your account, making purchases and selling cryptocurrency to potentially garner a profit.\n\nSaid to be using complex algorithms, the trading platform reportedly finds the best deals for investors and helps them get a foothold in the market. As you would expect, these trading bots can cover huge amounts of information much faster than manual methods. Furthermore, the system runs independently, which means you do not have to sit on the app for hours at a time to invest your money -- the AI will do it for you.\n\nWhat devices can I use the Bitcoin Prime app on?\n\nYou can use the Bitcoin Prime app on many devices, including:\n\nSmartphones\n\nTablets\n\nDesktop Browsers\n\nThe app is surprisingly straightforward and does not cost anything to download. However, you will have to deposit funds before you start making your trades. Luckily, Bitcoin Prime provides a demo account to help you figure out the finer details of the app without risking your money.\n\nCan I use Bitcoin Prime in my country?\n\nKeep in mind that the Bitcoin Prime platform is available in most countries that legalise cryptocurrency trading. Examples of countries where you can use Bitcoin Prime include the following.\n\nCountry Is Bitcoin Prime available?

Currently, there are ten languages available in the dropdown menu at the top of the Bitcoin Prime homepage. These include:\n\nEnglish\n\nFrench\n\nSpanish\n\nItalian\n\nHow easy is it to use the Bitcoin Prime app?\n\nThe Bitcoin Prime app is an easy-to-use auto-trading platform that is straightforward to navigate. When you sign up, you don\u2019t need to know much about the technical side of things because Bitcoin Prime provides a demo account to help new users find their feet on the trading platform. You also have access to a video tutorial, which will explain everything you need to know.\n\nBitcoin Prime uses AI technology to find you the best Bitcoin deals, making it both intuitive and passive. You don\u2019t need to do anything to make a potential profit.\n\nThat being said, you should be aware that robot trading is riskier than other platforms. If you want to remain in complete control over your investments, you may prefer to go somewhere else.\n\nHow much profit can you make using Bitcoin Prime?\n\nIt's a no-brainer that Bitcoin Prime is tailored to manage trades. However, traders are advised to always monitor their activities to remain in control. Also, have a budget and do not be money-driven if you want to succeed at trading. Remember, losses are inevitable, so plan carefully before beginning your ventures.\n\nSome traders claim that they make thousands of dollars daily trading with Bitcoin Prime. While this can be true, we couldn\u2019t find any information on Bitcoin Prime\u2019s website guaranteeing trades\u2019 success. The amount of profit you will earn depends on your trading strategy and the amount of capital you invest.\n\nIf you are a beginner, we advise you to start trading with small amounts to avoid risking losing all your capital in case a trade goes against your trading strategies. Also, keep in mind that the robot deducts 2% of your profits, and you will also report your earnings to the ATO for tax deductions.\n\nBitcoin Prime Key Features\n\nThere are many features on the Bitcoin Prime system that add to the overall experience and help you earn potential profits. These include:\n\nPayouts: The Bitcoin Prime trading platform has a reliable payout system, which offers transparency from the moment you make the investment until you receive your payment. The system uses software that ensures all calculations are wholly accurate and in line with the current market price. It uses commissions taken from account holders\u2019 profits to fund its system. In addition, it will only take a commission when you make a profit from your trades.\n\nEasy Withdrawal Process: If you are looking for an auto trading platform with speedy withdrawal processes, this is the one for you. Bitcoin Prime will usually process your withdrawal request within 24 hours.\n\nDemo Account: If you are unsure how to use the service, Bitcoin Prime has a helpful demo account that lets you explore the system without using your money. You can use this account until you feel comfortable investing actual funds into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nNews Trading: The trading algorithms featured on Bitcoin Prime also monitor the market news feed to stay ahead of the market. By doing so, the robot identifies news that could significantly affect the prices of cryptocurrencies and executes trades based on its findings. Note that using Bitcoin Prime in managing news-based trades can be beneficial since the robot moves faster than humans, thus allowing you to take advantage of most trading opportunities.\n\nBitcoin Prime Security and Regulation\n\nIs Bitcoin Prime legit?\n\nBitcoin Prime is legalised in most countries that allow Bitcoin trading. Moreover, information from its website claims that many individuals from diverse countries globally have signed up for an account with the robot. Remember, every country has its own financial market regulations, and the fact that individuals are trading with it is a good sign the robot is legit and accepted globally.\n\nIs Bitcoin Prime safe?\n\nAs mentioned above, Bitcoin Prime partners with regulated cryptocurrency brokers, ensuring the safety of your funds at all times. In addition, all account holders have to pass a know-your-customer (KYC) verification process to confirm their address and identity. This helps prevent any fraudulent activity on the trading platform. The site also uses SSL encryption with the aim of protecting your valuable information.\n\nAre my money and I protected?\n\nSince the Bitcoin Prime system doesn't store trading funds, you must be wondering whether your data is secured with the robot. Well, note that it is highly encrypted, and there is no history of it being hacked and traders\u2019 information accessed. Also, your email is safe, and based on reviews on Trustpilot, there are no complaints regarding traders\u2019 emails being hacked.\n\nIs Bitcoin Prime regulated?\n\nSome of the authorities regulating Bitcoin Prime's integrated brokers include Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC), Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), etc.\n\nDo I have to verify my account with Bitcoin Prime?\n\nYes, when you sign up with Bitcoin Prime, you are paired with a regulated broker who will then ask you for the relevant KYC documents and information to complete your account. KYC refers to documents that confirm your identity and address, such as photo ID and proof of address. This is an important part of the process as it helps keep the platform free from fraudulent activity.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Prime Work? Trading Strategies and Algorithms\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and there is no guarantee of successful trades in this market. However, the use of the robot maximises traders' potential since the trading bot is said to feature advanced trading strategies and algorithms. Let\u2019s analyse below how each trading strategy works to benefit your trades.\n\nIt uses superior technology to automate trades on behalf of cryptocurrency traders.

        "title": "Why Big Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple are Must-Have Cryptocurrencies? - Nairametrics",
        "content": "If you have been monitoring recent crypto trading charts, you must be aware of the newfound rally in major cryptocurrencies since the start of 2023. The truth of the matter is that the prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ripple are going northward and are gaining more traction among existing and new traders, businesses, and investors. Moreover, Big Eyes Coin has also joined the party by raising more than $21 million by Stage 10 of its presales. However, the presale phase is about to reach its end and if you are yet to pounce on the opportunity to grab a staggering 200% bonus, it is time to act.\n\nAlthough many cryptocurrencies offer similar services, some have stood out in a positive light. Each of these Big Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple has a special something that makes it unique and popular among other cryptocurrencies.\n\n1. They are Decentralized\n\nBig Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple Coin are not controlled by any central authority or government because they are decentralized. It adds an extra layer of security and protects their privacy, which allows users to trust their transactions. Decentralized networks don\u2019t have a central point of control, thereby mitigating the risk of a single point of failure.\n\nMoreover, hackers find it hard to breach into decentralized networks because they would need to attack many nodes in the network. These networks are more resistant to intervention from government entities or financial regulators.\n\n2. They Offer Security\n\nThe use of cutting-edge cryptography makes Big Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple Coin safe and secure options for their users. Security is an important factor when it comes to crypto trading.

They Deal with Liquidity Issues\n\nBitcoin and Ripple are widely traded, thereby making it easier to buy, sell and transfer them. Big Eyes Coin also comes with an innate ability to better deal with liquidity issues, which means it will soon join the ranks of the top cryptocurrencies for its innovation. All these three cryptocurrencies can easily be sold, bought, and transferred.\n\n4. Can\u2019t Ignore Immutability Factor\n\nIt\u2019s important to check out the immutability factor of these three cryptocurrencies. Transactions on their blockchain networks are permanent and unalterable, creating trust and transparency in the system. This is a significant advantage over traditional financial systems, where transactions can be altered or reversed.\n\n5. They Offer the Potential for High Returns\n\nWhether it is Big Eyes Coin, Ripple, or Bitcoin, the potential for price appreciation is on the higher side. It has been the case with both Bitcoin and Ripple in the past and the same is expected from the cat-themed meme coin Big Eyes Coin. With more people entering the crypto world, the chances for potentially high returns are unmatched.\n\nDon\u2019t Let the Opportunity Go Begging!\n\nThe opportunity is knocking on your door to enter the world of cryptocurrencies and make it big right away. Yes, you read it right! Big Eyes Coin, as part of its promotional campaigns, is offering a phenomenal 200% bonus. However, time is running out fast and if you want to get your hands on this incredible offer, you must act now. Use the promotional code LAUNCHBIGEYES200 today and give your crypto career the headstart it needs.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nThere are around 1,200 cryptocurrencies now and choosing the right one is nothing like a walk in the park. However, we have highlighted the above-mentioned factors that can help you in making the right decision.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin is the most popular of the lot, Big Eyes Coin and other such cryptocurrencies are making their way into contention for leading the show in the years to come. Some of the other significant cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, Litecoin, Namecoin, Syscoin, Dogecoin, and so on.\n\nBig Eyes Coin, Bitcoin, and Ripple are all excellent investment opportunities for those looking to enter the cryptocurrency market with a bang.\n\nFind Out More About Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nDisclaimer: Nairametrics is not affiliated with any cryptocurrency company.

        "content": "Court of Appeal orders Tulip Bitcoin case to go to full trial\n\nThe UK\u2019s Supreme Court\n\nLondon\u2019s Court of Appeal has sensationally announced that a claim by Tulip Trading Limited against 16 developers who are alleged to be responsible for the Bitcoin network will go to trial.\n\nTulip\u2019s claim alleges the developers owe \u2018fiduciary duties\u2019 and \u2018duties of care\u2019 to effectively police the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe \u2018core\u2019 developers \u2013 named in court documents as Wladimir Jasper van der Laan, Jonas Schnelli, Pieter Wuille, Marco Patrick Falke, Samuel Dobson, Michael Rohan Ford, Cory Fields, George Michael Dombrowski, Matthew Gregory Corallo, Peter Todd, Gregory Fulton Maxwell, Roger Ver, Amaury S\u00e9chet, Jason Bradley Cox, Bitcoin Association for BSV (a Swiss verein) and Eric Lombrozo \u2013 had previously succeeded in dismissing the claims summarily in March 2022.\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeal has today ruled that Tulip\u2019s claims give rise to a \u201cserious issue to be tried\u201d and should therefore proceed to a full trial in London, expected to be early next year.\n\nAstraea Group acted for fourteen of the developers instructed by Bird & Bird.\n\nJames Ramsden KC, who was lead and sole advocate for them in the Court of Appeal, said the outcome was one the Court of Appeal may have felt driven to because the developers were all outside the jurisdiction of the court permission to serve the proceedings on them.\n\n\u201cAnd that required Tulip to show that its claim gave rise to a serious issue to be tried,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cAs observed by the Court of Appeal in granting permission to appeal last August, it is in many ways a shame that this incredibly important case fell to be decided according to this low threshold test rather than at a full trial. The Court of Appeal has effectively agreed with that observation by deciding that the issues raised by this case are so important they merit determination at a full trial.\n\n\u201cTulip\u2019s claim has been bedevilled by pleading and presentational issues but once again the Court of Appeal have looked through them in favour of a ruling at a full trial that will deliver greater legal certainty.\u201d\n\nThe King\u2019s Counsel added that the courts in this jurisdiction continue to lead the common law world in developing a legal structure for the DeFi sector.\n\n\u201cThis case will be the most important so far in maintaining that lead and continuing to establish this jurisdiction as the leader for DeFi litigation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of this claim at trial will therefore have a profound impact and not just in the UK. That impact will apply regardless of whatever regulation the UK Government eventually settles on. So watch this space. I expect a full trial in early 2024.\u201d\n\nThe four \u2018relevant\u2019 grounds of appeal were listed in the official documents briefly as\u2026\n\ni) Ground 1: this is a developing, complex and uncertain area of law and therefore the point ought to go to trial;\n\nii) Ground 2: the conclusions are in error because they are based on findings impermissibly assumed against Tulip (5 specific points are taken);\n\niii) Ground 3: Taking into account the Law Commission project was an error;\n\niv) Ground 4: The judge was wrong to hold that Tulip has no real prospect of establishing that the claimed fiduciary duties exist (this ground involves 7 specific points).\n\nConcluding proceedings, Lord Justice Birrs, said he would allow the appeal. Lord Justice Lewison and Lord Justice Popplewell agreed.\n\n\u201cThe conclusion is not that there is a fiduciary duty in law in the circumstances alleged by Tulip, only that the case advanced raises a serious issue to be tried,\u201d Lord Justice Birrs stated.\n\n\u201cThe time to decide on the duty in this case is once the facts are established. As the judgment itself showed, to rule out Tulip\u2019s case as unarguable would require one to assume facts in the defendant developers\u2019 favour which are disputed and which cannot be resolved this way.\n\n\u201cIf the decentralised governance of Bitcoin really is a myth, then in my judgment there is much to be said for the submission that Bitcoin developers, while acting as developers, owe fiduciary duties to the true owners of that property.\u201d"

        "title": "Celebrating The Tulip Mania Anniversary With Bitcoin & Crypto | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Three hundred and eighty-six years ago today, the first ever bubble \u2013 dubbed Tulip Mania \u2013 popped. Often compared with Bitcoin, Tulip Mania provided a blueprint for all future bubbles and related behaviors.\n\nTo celebrate the anniversary of Tulip Mania, we are once again comparing the first recorded instance of a bubble with Bitcoin and dispel the idea there are any valid similarities.\n\nThe Dutch Golden Age & The Formation Of The First Speculative Bubble\n\nDuring the Dutch Golden Age, the Netherlands became the largest economic superpower in the world. The initial hysteria surrounding futures contracts for tulips started in 1634 and peaked on February 3, 1637 \u2013 386 years ago..\n\nThe Dutch debuted the first futures contracts, which ultimately led to feverish speculation and the first record of the socio-economic phenomenon now referred to as a \u201cbubble.\u201d\n\nRelatively worthless tulips (by comparison to prices) were bid up to ten times the annual salary of a \u201cskilled artisan,\u201d Wikipedia reads. The term Tulip Mania is now used \u201cmetaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble when asset prices deviate from intrinsic values.\u201d\n\nAn outbreak of the bubonic plague helped burst the bubble by forcing buyers and sellers from showing up at the traditional daily auctions. However, it is also said the fear surrounding the plague led to the intense speculative behavior that drove up prices.\n\nBitcoin: \u201cWorse Than Tulip Mania\u201d\n\nTulip Mania was popularized again in the 1841 book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, and has since become a popular comparison each time any asset climbs beyond its intrinsic value. The comparison is used even more frequently when the intrinsic value of the asset is called into question.\n\nThe dot com bubble was compared to Tulip Mania, and more recent Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Nout Wellink, the former president of the Dutch Central Bank, home of Tulip Mania, called Bitcoin \u201cworse than Tulip Mania\u201d back in December 2013.\n\n\u201cAt least then you got a tulip, now you get nothing,\u201d he explained. Because Bitcoin is backed by a decentralized, distributed cryptographic ledger and lacks a physical presence, pundits struggle to see the asset\u2019s intrinsic value.\n\nBitcoin has climbed more than 1,800% since Wellink's comments | BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nSeveral different models have been designed to help give BTC a fair market value, but the results are inconclusive and more evidence is needed. For example, the once-famous stock-to-flow model projected prices of well over $100,000 Bitcoin at a time when the top cryptocurrency traded at under $20,000.\n\nWhen Bitcoin reached $20,000 for the first time in late 2017, the intrinsic value became wildly disconnected from reality and thus the bubble popped. The fact that Bitcoin went on to establish new all-time high shows that it\u2019s more than just a bubble and that the world continues to see its intrinsic value \u2013 even if others might not.\n\nThe truth is that Bitcoin has bubbled up not once, nor twice, but a total of four times in the past, and it could very well do it again. The next time that investors speculation appears to get out of hand and BTC pushes far beyond its intrinsic value, it will be time to sell because the bubble is about to burst once again.\n\nAs a parting thought, if investors can go through periods of extreme speculative behavior that leads to bubbles, can the same extremes create what is essentially a reverse bubble of falling prices? And with sentiment more bearish than in any other time in history, is this reverse bubble in Bitcoin starting to burst?\n\nThere is a lot to learn from the history of past bubbles, starting with the first. \ud83c\udf37 https://t.co/r2LzynO7RP \u2014 Tony \"The Bull\" (@tonythebullBTC) February 3, 2023"

        "title": "El Salvador: will bitcoin bonds arrive in 2023? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The soap opera about the Bitcoin bonds that El Salvador should issue to finance the construction of Bitcoin City continues.\n\nEl Salvador: the failure to launch Bitcoin bonds.\n\nThe announcement of the plan to launch these bonds occurred in November 2021, at the height of the bubble.\n\nIn theory, they were supposed to be put on the market in March of that year, but the launch eventually skipped, despite it being stated that there were $500 million in applications.\n\nIn reality, El Salvador\u2019s goal was to raise $1 billion, to be allocated partly to the implementation of Bitcoin City, and partly instead to the mere purchase of BTC.\n\nRaising dollars in March 2022 and investing them in BTC would not have been a good idea, given what happened next, so it is possible that they decided to postpone the bond launch to wait for better times to buy Bitcoin.\n\nThose times may be here now, so it is not surprising that it is precisely in February 2023 that they seem to want to finally launch them.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s public debt and Bitcoin bond issuance.\n\nMoreover, there was a potentially big problem, related precisely to the country\u2019s public debt, which was only resolved in late January.\n\nWell, we just paid in full, 800 million dollars plus interest. But of course, almost nobody is covering the story. I just found one, yes ONE, in spanish, from Colombia https://t.co/PcRES3poE1 They lie and lie and lie, and when their lies are exposed, they go on silence mode. \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) January 24, 2023\n\nThe country has a public debt that while not excessively high in relation to GDP (83 percent) is still by no means easy to sustain.\n\nAmid the 2020 crisis, due to the pandemic, it skyrocketed in a single year from 73% to 92% of GDP, partly due to the reduction in GDP itself.\n\nIt must not have been easy to cope with such a rapid and major surge in the debt-to-GDP ratio, but it already dropped to 84 percent the following year.\n\nSo it has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, but it has already come down quite a bit, partly because of the rebound in GDP in 2021.\n\nGiven that bonds are also for all intents and purposes government debt, and given that several international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have expressed a negative opinion on the country\u2019s financial strategies, the government may have had to slow down a bit so that it could first give a clear signal of the sustainability of its debt.\n\nFor it should not be forgotten that El Salvador\u2019s creditors include the IMF, which therefore has a say in the matter.\n\nNow that the situation seems to have softened, the chances that it can finally issue Bitcoin bonds, also known as Volcano bonds, seem to be greater.\n\nLaunching in 2023?\n\nA few days ago Bloomberg published an article speculating that the launch of El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin bonds could take place later this year.\n\nSpecifically, Bloomberg writes that the crypto exchange Bitfinex expects the bond token to be launched later this year.\n\nIn fact, the bonds are expected to be launched in a tokenized format, with the tokens created by the specialized company Blockstream. The bond tokens should be listed on Bitfinex so that they can be purchased by investors.\n\nDigital securities law will enable El Salvador to be the financial center of central and south America.\n\n\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfb https://t.co/1QBcrjxQCC \u2014 Paolo Ardoino \ud83c\udf50 (@paoloardoino) November 23, 2022\n\nIn December last year, El Salvador\u2019s parliament officially passed a special law allowing the country to issue its first bond.\n\nAccording to Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino, at this time there should be sufficient market demand to allow El Salvador to raise the full $1 billion it intends to collect from the bond issue.\n\nHowever, there is still one bureaucratic step that needs to be taken before the bond can be launched, and that is the creation of a digital securities regulator so that the prospectus can be drafted for potential investors.\n\nIn addition, Bitfinex still needs to obtain a license from the local regulator to be able to offer the security exchange, and this should happen once its El Salvador office becomes operational.\n\nAlthough Ardoino claims that they are on track to make things happen on time, it seems like it will still be a while before the Bitcoin bond can be launched.\n\nBitcoin in El Salvador\n\nAfter adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar, El Salvador is looking to become a sort of crypto hub of Latin America.\n\nIn fact, in Central America, where the small state of El Salvador is located, there are currently no real crypto hubs. However, it could suffer from possible competition with Mexico, which is a much larger and more powerful state where signs of interest in the crypto world have been beginning to appear for some time.\n\nAs of now, Mexico has not taken any concrete steps to try to become a crypto hub, while El Salvador has.\n\nIt should not be forgotten, however, that Central America is adjacent to, and very similar to, South America. In South America, there are in particular two nations where cryptocurrencies could attract a lot of interest, namely Brazil and Argentina.\n\nIndeed, there are already many people interested in Brazil, but the nation has no crypto hub on its soil.\n\nIn Argentina, the spread of cryptocurrencies is less, but given the huge problems they have with their local currency, it\u2019s possible that sooner or later the interest of Argentines will pick up.\n\nNot to mention Venezuela, where the first state \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d experiment failed, and neighboring Colombia.\n\nSo the chances that El Salvador could become Latin America\u2019s crypto hub par excellence are there, so much so that the adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender has already brought benefits in this respect.\n\nIndeed, both the number of tourists traveling to the country has increased, thanks in part to the fact that they can conveniently pay in BTC with minimal fees thanks to the use of Lightning Network, and the number of businesses that are opening locations in the country, Bitfinex foremost among them.\n\nThe importance of a favorable regulatory framework\n\nThe fact is that Bitcoin being by all means a legal tender, in El Salvador the regulatory framework is, by necessity, favorable to its use. This also implies a favorable framework towards the use of similar instruments, such as Ethereum and to some extent stablecoins.\n\nThe very idea of creating Bitcoin City reveals quite clearly the intentions of the Salvadoran government, namely to make its territory decidedly favorable to people and companies that want to use Bitcoin, and other crypto assets.\n\nGiven that there is still no real crypto hub in Latin America, and given that cryptocurrencies are beginning to spread throughout the continent, President Bukele\u2019s gamble may eventually turn out to be a very good idea, especially if indeed many crypto companies decide to also operate with territorial offices physically located in El Salvador.\n\nIn other words, it appears that the country is voluntarily, and purposely, building a favorable environment for the crypto sector to attract companies and individuals, effectively opening up a whole new world of economic opportunities that have historically been in short supply instead.\n\nEl Salvador is not only a poor country (111th in the world in per capita GDP, out of 196 total countries), it also has a recent history of violence, abuse, corruption, and dictatorship behind it, from which it is eager to finally emerge.\n\nover the past decade it has already come a long way to get out of that condition bordering on acceptable for a Latin American country, and becoming a crypto hub could finally give it the big break out of poverty as well, should many crypto companies open physical and active locations in its territory.\n\nIt is, however, a very slow and bumpy path, but the way now seems open. In the absence of strong competitors in that area of the world, the chances of it succeeding are definitely greater than zero."

        "content": "With gains of about 40% in 2023, Bitcoin (BTC) is enjoying a successful start of the year. Therefore, investors are hoping that the crypto can sustain the gains in the coming months.\n\nDespite the optimism, United States adults surveyed in January 2023 are projecting a gloomy future for Bitcoin, predicting that the asset will likely trade at $15,252 in the next sixth months, according to research published on January 24 by Morning Consult.\n\nThe adult price projection represents a drop of about 34% from Bitcoin\u2019s value at the time of publishing. Notably, the survey results had a monthly sample size of 4,400 U.S. adults.\n\nRespondents were asked in January 2023 what they expect the price of Bitcoin to be in the next six months. Source: Morningconsult.com.\n\nFrom the feedback, it is clear that their confidence in Bitcoin among the respondents is diminishing despite the asset starting the year on a positive note.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin has gained significantly in 2023, holding above the $23,000 level, the asset is still facing uncertainty. It is worth noting that Bitcoin is operating in almost similar conditions that characterized last year\u2019s bear market.\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin appears to be recovering from the uncertainty of macroeconomic factors, but the short-term projection remains shaky. In this case, despite an improvement in key macroeconomic factors, Bitcoin prospects also depend on the overall health of the economy that\u2019s staring at a possible recession.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s facing possible reversal\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin price has failed to breach and hold the $24,000 resistance level despite the latest Federal Reserve policy on interest rates. In particular, the Fed raised rates by 0.25% as expected, a factor that was viewed as a possible trigger for a rally among risk assets such as Bitcoin. Notably, Bitcoin reacted positively to test $24,000 briefly.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s bullish momentum is facing the risk of invalidation after the latest U.S. unemployment data. Notably, over 500,000 jobs were added in January to beat expectations, with unemployment rates falling to the lowest level in almost six decades.\n\nIt is worth noting that the robust payrolls number could shatter traders\u2019 hopes that the Fed would delay rate hikes or consider rate reduction in the coming months if the U.S. employment situation significantly worsened.\n\nAt the same time, the jobs data bodes well for the dollar but can potentially trigger a sell-off in risk-on assets like Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, regulations remain a possible reason for the gloomy Bitcoin projection. It is worth noting that several state agencies, including the White House, have made clear their plans to regulate crypto.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nThe maiden cryptocurrency currently trades at $23,337, representing daily losses of over 1%. On the weekly chart, BTC is up over 1%.\n\nBitcoin price 7-day chart. Source: Finbold.com\n\nElsewhere, Bitcoin\u2019s technical analysis is mostly bullish. A summary of the one-day gauges is for the \u2018buy\u2019 sentiment at 14, while moving averages recommend \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 13. Oscillators remain neutral with a gauge of 9.\n\nTA-indicators for Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.com\n\nIn the meantime, the machine learning algorithm at PricePredictions indicates that Bitcoin will likely extend the bullish momentum in the coming weeks to trade at $24,342 on February 28, 2023."
