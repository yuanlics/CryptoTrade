        "content": "The Central American country became the first worldwide to adopt Bitcoin as a legal currency in 2021. The IMF said the government should be more transparent.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has urged the government of El Salvador to exercise greater transparency with its Bitcoin transactions, highlighting the cryptocurrency's \"risks.\"\n\nIn September 2021, El Salvador became the first country worldwide to introduce Bitcoin as a legal tender alongside the US dollar. El Salvador's Congress passed a law last month to regulate the issuance of other digital assets by the state and private entities.\n\nIn a report on Friday, the IMF once again warned the government regarding Bitcoin following a visit to the country.\n\n\"While risks have not materialized due to the limited bitcoin use so far,\" the IMF report said, the use of the cryptocurrency could grow, given new legislative reforms adopted to encourage its use.\n\nThe IMF noted that \"underlying risks to financial integrity and stability, fiscal sustainability, and consumer protection persist.\"\n\nHow has El Salvador embraced Bitcoin?\n\nPresident Nayib Bukele, reputed to be a tech enthusiast, is attempting to get more of the country's residents to use traceable ways of exchanging goods and money. Many Salvadorians do not have bank accounts.\n\nThe country rolled out a digital wallet, called Chivo, in September 2021, parallel to adopting Bitcoin as a legal currency. Many Salvadorans have since protested against the move and Bukele's policies in general.\n\nBukele then announced last November that the country's treasury would start buying a Bitcoin every day.\n\nThe Reuters news agency has calculated nearly 2,470 coins were acquired by the government for about $106.4 million (\u20ac99.4 million) since the announcement. The Salvadoran government doesn't officially disclose purchases, holdings or where the coins are kept.\n\nIn its statement, the IMF stressed the importance of \"greater transparency over the government's transactions in Bitcoin and the financial situation of the state-owned Bitcoin-wallet (Chivo).\"\n\nDespite the warnings, the IMF report applauded the growth of the Salvadoran economy by 2.8% in 2022. It cited the government's effective pandemic response, the \"unprecedented\" crime reduction and the strong tourism revenues as the reasons.\n\nAt the same time, IMF officials warned that Salvadoran exports and remittances could be affected by a pronounced slowdown in the US.\n\nBitcoin is now legal tender in El Salvador To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nrmt/dj (AFP, Reuters)"

        "title": "Cathie Wood Thinks Bitcoin Is Going to $1.48 Million. Is She Right? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "With Bitcoin (BTC 1.61%) turning in its best January performance since 2013, it's no surprise that analysts are ratcheting up their price targets for this suddenly hot crypto. Bitcoin was up nearly 40% in January, and that has led to a completely revised outlook for just how high this crypto could fly in coming years.\n\nCathie Wood of Ark Invest -- known for her previously controversial $1 million price target for Bitcoin -- has just ratcheted up her Bitcoin price prediction. She now thinks Bitcoin could skyrocket to $1.48 million by 2030. But just how feasible is that prediction?\n\nThe long-term growth story for Bitcoin\n\nAccording to Wood, the case for Bitcoin at these stratospheric levels is really a story of enormous growth on a global scale. Over time, the story goes, Bitcoin will account for a larger and larger share of global assets held by institutions. It will continue to scale globally as more nations accept it as legal tender, and as more people use Bitcoin to carry out online transactions.\n\nThis story gets more interesting when Ark Invest lays out the specific numbers behind its assumptions. Ark Invest suggests there will be eight primary market segments (e.g., \"emerging market currency\" and \"remittance asset\") where Bitcoin will see growth. Based on estimates about the penetration rate for Bitcoin in each of those markets, it is possible to develop a bearish, a base case, and a bullish scenario for Bitcoin's price.\n\nHow fast can Bitcoin grow?\n\nSo, for example, Ark Invest suggests that Bitcoin could account for up to 10% of the M2 money supply of emerging market countries. Thus far, there are only two nations that have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender -- El Salvador and the Central African Republic -- so this seems a bit optimistic. According to some economists, nations that struggle with hyperinflation or devalued currencies could decide to embrace Bitcoin.\n\nArk Invest also suggests that Bitcoin could capture 25% of the \"remittance asset\" market, and 50% of the \"digital gold\" market. So, imagine one in four migrants around the world sending money back to family and loved ones in the form of Bitcoin, and one in two central banks around the world deciding to build their Bitcoin reserves instead of their physical gold reserves. In addition, Ark Invest suggests that Bitcoin will soon account for 6.5% of institutional investor portfolio holdings.\n\nAll of these numbers are aggressive, but not entirely unthinkable. It really depends on how you view global growth, and how much faith you have in fiat currency.\n\nFrom my perspective, the \"base case\" estimates provided by Ark Invest make a lot more sense than the \"bullish case\" numbers. For example, in a base case scenario, Bitcoin will only account for 3% of the M2 money supply of emerging market countries. And Bitcoin will only account for 2.5% of institutional investor portfolios. The problem here is that even Ark Invest acknowledges that these \"base case\" assumptions only support a future price of $682,800 for Bitcoin, well below the pie-in-the-sky figure of $1.48 million.\n\nDo the numbers make sense?\n\nMoreover, it's helpful to stress-test these assumptions about Bitcoin against current asset values in global markets. Given that Bitcoin has a fixed coin supply of 21 million, a target price of $1.48 million implies a total market capitalization of $31 trillion.\n\nJust how big of a number is that? Well, the total value of the world's physical gold supply is estimated to be worth about $12 trillion, so Bitcoin would be worth more than 2.5x all the gold in the world today. Moreover, the total value of the S&P 500 is approximately $32 trillion. So, Bitcoin would be worth almost the same as the 500 largest publicly traded companies in America today.\n\nFor that reason, I don't think $1.48 million is a reasonable price target for Bitcoin. Even a $1 million price target seems to be a bit of wishful thinking on the part of the Bitcoin bulls. That would imply a market cap of $21 trillion, which is nearly 10x the current market cap of Apple. Would you rather own all the Bitcoin in the world, or all the equity in 10 different Apple corporations?\n\nWhile I'm long-term bullish on Bitcoin, I also think it's important to have a sense of scale here. If Warren Buffett thinks the value of all the Bitcoin in the world isn't even $25, and Cathie Wood thinks the value of all the Bitcoin in the world is $31 trillion, a rational person would say that the real value of Bitcoin is somewhere in the middle. I'm bullish that Bitcoin will eventually regain its $1 trillion market cap -- I just think it will take longer than some people think."

        "title": "Bitcoin miners as energy buyers, explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Why does mining crypto use energy? The energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is a trade-off for the security and decentralization of blockchain networks. However, through the use of sustainable energy sources and effective mining algorithms, there are ongoing efforts to make the process more energy-efficient and sustainable. Mining crypto uses energy because it is a process that requires computers to perform complex mathematical calculations in order to validate transactions and add new blocks to a blockchain. These calculations use a lot of computer resources, which results in high energy usage. The main sources of energy consumption are the CPUs and GPUs, as well as the cooling systems necessary to keep mining rigs cool. The first step in mining cryptocurrency is to confirm the transactions on the blockchain network using a consensus algorithm such as proof-of-work, which calls for miners to solve challenging mathematical puzzles. Miners use specialized software and hardware, such as ASICs, to perform these calculations at high speeds. The first miner to solve the puzzle adds the following block to the blockchain and receives a specific quantity of Bitcoin (BTC) in return. In order to increase their odds of becoming the first to solve the puzzle, miners are motivated to employ as much computer power as they can. As more miners join the network and competition heats up, the need for energy rises, resulting in increased electricity usage. According to some estimates, the entire energy use of the Bitcoin network alone might be comparable to that of a small nation. The energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is a concern because it has an environmental impact. The majority of the power required for mining is generated from fossil fuels, which cause the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. The cost of electricity for mining can be rather high in some areas, which makes it less economical for miners.\n\nDo Bitcoin miners use renewable energy resources to mine? While a sizable fraction of Bitcoin mining currently uses non-renewable energy sources, there is a growing tendency among miners to power their operations with renewable energy sources. It is likely that more miners will use renewable energy as it becomes more affordable to power their operations. As already noted, Bitcoin mining uses a lot of energy for miners to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain by using powerful computers to solve challenging mathematical puzzles. Initially, the majority of Bitcoin mining took place in China, which is also the biggest generator of coal-based electricity in the world. As a result, non-renewable energy sources accounted for a sizable amount of the energy utilized to mine BTC. When comparing Bitcoin mining by nation, the United States ranks the highest, making it a legal activity after Bitcoin mining was outlawed in China. The use of renewable energy sources by miners, such as hydroelectricity, is an increasing trend, though. This is especially true in areas with a wealth of renewable energy sources, such as Quebec and Iceland. Additionally, due to a fall in the price of renewable energy sources, mining companies are beginning to use them to power their operations. Moreover, in order to fuel their mining operations, several businesses are also investing in their own renewable energy initiatives, such as solar and wind farms.\n\nHow do Bitcoin miners act as energy buyers? To power their mining operations, Bitcoin miners either purchase electricity from conventional and renewable energy sources or develop and run their own renewable energy facilities, turning them into energy consumers. Miners typically purchase electricity from energy providers, such as utility companies or independent power producers, to mine BTC. They then use that electricity to power their mining equipment. This can include both traditional energy sources, such as coal or natural gas, as well as renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind energy. Hydro-Quebec, a Canadian utility company that sells electricity to Bitcoin miners, is a real-world example of how Bitcoin miners act as energy buyers. In order to take advantage of the low electricity prices in the province, the firm has been actively courting Bitcoin miners to establish operations there and utilize excess hydroelectric power to mine BTC. In some circumstances, miners might also sign long-term agreements with energy suppliers, which could provide them access to a more reliable and consistent source of electricity. Large-scale miners can benefit the most from this, as it enables them to plan and budget for their energy requirements in advance. By establishing and running their own renewable energy facilities, such as solar or wind farms, Bitcoin miners can also take on the role of energy users and function as energy purchasers. By doing this, they support the switch to sustainable energy sources as well as securing energy for their mining activities. For instance, a Bitcoin miner called Genesis Mining has established operations in Iceland and is running them using geothermal and hydroelectric energy. This allows the miner to benefit from Iceland\u2019s plentiful renewable energy resources and lessen its environmental impact. Additionally, one of the largest Bitcoin mining facilities in the world, KnCMiner, is powered by a wind farm that the company developed on its own land in Sweden. To make use of extra energy that would otherwise be wasted, miners may also choose to locate their mining operations next to existing renewable energy facilities, such as hydroelectric dams or geothermal plants. For instance, the Bitcoin miner Greenidge Generation in upstate New York, U.S. generates electricity for its mining operations using extra natural gas from a local power plant. The company also constructed a 7-megawatt solar farm to help meet its energy requirements.\n\nHow do renewable energy resources benefit Bitcoin mining in rural areas? Renewable energy sources offer a more reliable power supply for Bitcoin mining operations since they are less prone to experiencing power disruptions. Additionally, using sustainable energy for Bitcoin mining can support job growth and economic expansion in rural areas. In the context of Bitcoin, gridless computing, which refers to the usage of alternative computing resources such as edge devices, can encourage the use of renewable energy resources to mine BTC in Africa. That said, gridless computing offers an alternative to the centralized electrical grid, which is often unreliable or unavailable in many parts of the continent. This can enable miners to operate in remote or off-grid locations using locally generated renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power. The lack of electrical infrastructure in many rural parts of Africa makes it challenging to establish and run conventional mining operations. Gridless computing, on the other hand, enables miners to power their mining machinery with portable, decentralized renewable energy sources like solar or wind turbines. This enables miners to establish operations in remote locations and make use of the region\u2019s abundant renewable energy resources. Gridless computing can also promote the growth of community-based mining operations, which can assist nearby areas economically by generating jobs and sources of income. By offering education and training on sustainable energy methods, these community-based mining companies can also encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources."

        "title": "MicroStrategy: Bitcoin's White Knight? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Before MicroStrategy became one of the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin bulls, the software company was relatively unknown outside big tech and traditional finance. That changed in 2020 when the Fortune 500 enterprise added Bitcoin holdings to its balance sheet.\n\nMicroStrategy is one of the key players in the cryptocurrency market and the wider blockchain industry. Led by chairman Michael Saylor, they were among the first corporate entities to consider BTC as a store of value. This paved the way for other notable companies, like Tesla, to make their Bitcoin purchases.\n\nWe know MicroStrategy is an avid supporter of digital currency, but what is the company behind the internet fame? Do they hold any other digital assets, like Ethereum or NFTs?\n\nWhat Is MicroStrategy?\n\nFounded by Michael Saylor in 1989, MicroStrategy is a software company that provides powerful analytics and business intelligence tools. MicroStrategy products are used by some of the world\u2019s largest companies and household names, such as Visa and Porsche.\n\nOf course, developing data dashboards can only take a company so far. As part of its expanded offering, MicroStrategy provides cloud computing services.\n\nBut is the relationship between MicroStrategy and Bitcoin?\n\nMicroStrategy in the Crypto Market\n\nAccording to Coingecko (as of Feb 2023), MicroStrategy owns more Bitcoin than any other public company, including some leading exchanges like Coinbase. Unfazed by events like the FTX crash and crypto bear markets, MicroStrategy sees BTC as a long-term investment.\n\nBuying Bitcoin for the First Time\n\nMicroStrategy first expressed interest in Bitcoin in mid-2020 as a hedge against inflation. The United States Dollar (USD) was rapidly losing value following the economic fallout of the pandemic.\n\nIn a June earnings call with the company\u2019s CFO, Phong Le, Saylor mentioned that \u201cit makes sense to shift our treasury assets into some investments that can\u2019t be inflated away\u2026\u201d. By August 2020, MicroStrategy announced they\u2019d acquired 21,454 BTC at a market value of over $250M. The price of BTC at the time was around $11,000.\n\nSince then, MicroStrategy has routinely added to their bitcoin holdings, regardless of the volatility in the crypto market. As of February 2023, the tech giant\u2019s average price of Bitcoin purchases is roughly $30,415 per BTC.\n\nHas MicroStrategy Ever Sold Its Bitcoin?\n\nAfter a challenging year for Bitcoin, mainstream media and crypto news outlets eagerly shared the trending story: MicroStrategy sells. It seemed like following the last year\u2019s crypto winter, Saylor and Co needed to cut their losses.\n\nDespite what the headlines suggested, MicroStrategy explained in an SEC filing that they planned \u201cto carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains\u2026 which may generate a tax benefit.\u201d\n\nWhile this may have spread brief fear and doubt in the crypto market, MicroStrategy has since repurchased bitcoin. The company\u2019s conviction in digital currency runs deeper than ever. Per a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, MicroStrategy plans to sell its other assets to fund further BTC investments.\n\nWhat Is MicroStrategy\u2019s Liquidation Price?\n\nAccording to Binance, MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin investment has been partly funded by Silvergate loans. Additionally, one of the tech firm\u2019s subsidiaries, MacroStrategy, has a leveraged position in Bitcoin.\n\nIn a significant crash, MacroStrategy would need to add additional collateral to its position to avoid liquidation. If the price of bitcoin were to drop to $13,644, Macrostrategy would receive an unwelcome margin call.\n\nWhen will MicroStrategy be forced to sell? Hopefully, not anytime soon. MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC position comes under threat of liquidation at a much lower price of around $3,561.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s Other Crypto Holdings\n\nDespite being undoubtedly bullish on BTC and blockchain technology, MicroStrategy does not officially hold any other cryptocurrencies. Altcoins like ETH are not listed on the MicroStrategy balance sheet.\n\nBeing a bitcoin maximalist does have its drawbacks. Ironically, if MicroStrategy had bought Ethereum instead of Bitcoin, they would\u2019ve seen better returns. By purchasing ETH, as opposed to BTC, MicroStrategy would hold 3,540,000 ETH.\n\nMicroStrategy in the Stock Market\n\nAdding Bitcoin to the company\u2019s balance sheet has drawn mixed responses from MicroStrategy (MSTR) investors. Holding BTC has exposed the company\u2019s treasury to greater volatility, which appears to coincide with the performance of the MSTR stock.\n\nBloomberg suggests that MSTR stock hit its lowest price since 2020 following MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC purchases in December 2022. It\u2019s important to note that, at that time, MicroStrategy had lost over one billion USD through its Bitcoin investments.\n\nWhat Is Michael Saylor\u2019s Role at MicroStrategy?\n\nIn August 2021, MicroStrategy co-founder and CEO Michael Saylor stepped down. Saylor remains heavily involved with the company in his new role as executive chairman. The shift gives Saylor greater flexibility to pursue MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin strategy.\n\nSaylor\u2019s position as CEO was replaced by the former CFO and President, Phong Le.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile some might consider MicroStrategy\u2019s liquidation point impossible, it would surely trigger widespread panic in the crypto market. If MicroStrategy were forced to sell its BTC holdings, it could be a fatal blow to the price of Bitcoin and the reputation of cryptocurrency and blockchain.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nMicroStrategy is the largest Bitcoin holder amongst corporate entities. Their belief and support of BTC and the blockchain industry represent the arrival of institutional investment into the crypto space.\n\nThis improves the image of cryptocurrency and Web 3.0 technologies in the view of both traditional finance and the general public. MicroStrategy\u2019s investment is a step toward the mass adoption of bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nF.A.Q.S."

        "title": "Emblem Vault: Bitcoin NFTs made easy - NFT Culture",
        "content": "The creation of Emblem Vault in 2020 has opened up a world of possibilities for Bitcoin NFTs, making it easier to trade and build a strong digital portfolio. In this article, we will explore the benefits of using Emblem Vault and why it is set to revolutionize the world of NFTs.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s understand what Emblem Vault is. It is a tokenized multi-asset wallet on the Ethereum blockchain that allows you to trade portfolios of NFTs and cryptocurrencies, including assets from different chains, as a single token. The vault is created as a unique ERC-721 token, and each vault contains a series of blockchain addresses generated from a single secret phrase. This means that you can store various digital assets in each address and only the person with the secret phrase can send assets to other wallets.\n\nBenefits of Emblem Vault for BTC NFTs\n\nOne of the key benefits of Emblem Vault is the ability to create a value-backed digital vault. This means you can store one or more digital assets, along with some cryptocurrency, in a single vault, making it easier to manage your digital assets. This is especially useful for individuals who want to keep their digital assets safe and secure.\n\nAnother benefit of Emblem Vault is the ability to create tradeable portfolios. This allows you to combine multiple assets into a single token, making it easier to trade and manage your portfolio. For example, you can create a portfolio that contains 50% ETH, 40% Bitcoin, and 10% LINK, and trade all these assets as a single ERC-721 NFT. This simplifies the process of managing your digital assets and makes it easier to keep track of your investments.\n\nEmblem Vault also enables you to create portable liquidity pools. This means you can create a vault with multiple pooled tokens to make transferable liquidity pools, as well as transparent funds. You can do this because Emblem Vault enables you to create a vault that is held by a community or other trusted third parties. This can be especially useful for individuals or organizations looking to pool their resources and invest in digital assets together.\n\nIn addition, Emblem Vault works by wrapping digital assets to make them modern ERC-721 NFTs, which can be traded on popular NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. This means that you can buy and sell assets that predate the ERC-721 standard, such as Rare Pepe\u2019s. This opens up a world of possibilities for those looking to invest in NFTs and allows you to trade assets that were previously difficult to buy and sell.\n\nFurthermore, Emblem Vault is user-friendly and easy to use. To create your own vault, simply go to Emblem.Finance, select Create, connect the wallet you would like to use, and then add a name and description. You can also buy and sell Emblem Vault NFTs on popular platforms such as OpenSea, LooksRare, and their official website.\n\nEmblem Vault is set to revolutionize the world of NFTs by making it easier to trade and manage digital assets. With its ability to create value-backed digital vaults, tradeable portfolios, and portable liquidity pools, it offers a range of benefits to individuals and organizations looking to invest in digital assets. Its user-friendly interface and the ability to wrap digital assets to make them tradable on popular NFT marketplaces make it a game-changer in the world of NFTs. If you\u2019re looking to invest in NFTs, it\u2019s definitely worth considering Emblem Vault."

        "title": "2022 realized cap drawdown was second worst in Bitcoin's history - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Analyzing Bitcoin\u2019s market cap shows that the 2022 bear market brought the fourth worse drawdown from the all-time high in its history. Bitcoin\u2019s drop to $15,500 represents a 76.92% drawdown from its ATH.\n\nMarket capitalization is one of the most widely used metrics when estimating the size and value of an asset. Defined as the combined value of all units of an asset, market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the price by the circulating supply.\n\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin, market capitalization and its fluctuation is often used to determine the strength and adoption of the network. It\u2019s also especially useful when comparing Bitcoin to other assets and markets.\n\nThe most significant price drawdown from ATH happened at the end of 2011 when an aggressive bear market wiped out 91.78% of Bitcoin\u2019s market cap. Crypto winters in 2015 and 2018/2019 saw drawdowns of 82.75% and 82.63%, respectively.\n\nThis is in line with CryptoSlate\u2019s previous analysis, which found that each market cycle posted higher lows.\n\nHowever, market capitalization fails to represent the actual state of the network. Due to a large number of lost and inactive coins, market capitalization is often higher than the realized value of the network.\n\nThis is where realized cap comes in, as it shows the value of the Bitcoin network based on active coins.\n\nUnlike market cap, which values coins based on their current value, realized cap values each UTXO based on the price at which it last moved. This approach is a much better proxy for the value stored in Bitcoin and can be used as an estimate of the aggregate cost basis of the network.\n\nRealized cap drastically reduces dormant and lost coins\u2019 impact on the network. These coins are seen as having low economic value, as they were last moved at a price so much lower than its realized price that they have little impact on it. However, if these coins were moved after being dormant for years, their impact on the realized price would be correspondingly significant.\n\nThe magnitude of change in realized cap shows the difference in price between the price at which a coin was last spent and the price at which it previously moved.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin\u2019s price through the realized cap shows that the 2022 drawdown was the second worse in its history. In November 2022, Bitcoin saw its realized cap drop by 18.8% from the all-time high recorded in November 2021.\n\nGraph showing Bitcoin\u2019s realized price drawdown from ATH from 2011 to 2023 (Source: Glassnode)\n\nThe ongoing bear market put Bitcoin\u2019s realized cap at $383 billion. This is $56 billion lower than Bitcoin\u2019s current market cap, which stands at $439 billion.\n\nComparing Bitcoin\u2019s market cap to its realized cap is believed to be a good indicator of market phases. Namely, when the market cap is higher than the realized cap, the market is in aggregate profit.\n\nPut simply, the realized cap shows the value at which the coins were bought, while the market cap shows the value at which they can be sold.\n\nConversely, when the realized cap is higher than the market cap, the market is in aggregate loss, as the value at which most coins were bought is higher than the value at which they can be sold.\n\nData analyzed by CryptoSlate showed that the market is currently in aggregate profit. And while that profit isn\u2019t as high as the crypto market is used to, it indicates a slow and steady recovery from the second-worst price downturn in Bitcoin\u2019s history."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is beginning its \u201cseventh bull cycle,\u201d and investors should not be scared of crypto post-FTX, Pantera Capital believes.\n\nIn its latest \u201cBlockchain Letter\u201d on Feb. 8, the asset management firm\u2019s CEO, Dan Morehead, predicted that 2023 would be a \u201cyear for rebuilding trust.\u201d\n\nMorehead: Crypto assets have \u201cseen the lows\u201d this cycle\n\nWith BTC price action retracing slightly after gaining 40% in January, some market participants still insist that new macro lows are due across crypto assets.\n\nWhile the timing for such a scenario varies, consensus remains absent when it comes to how the market will rebound.\n\nFor Morehead, however, the time to flip bullish on crypto is already here.\n\n\u201cPantera has been through ten years of Bitcoin cycles and I\u2019ve traded through 35 years of similar cycles,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cI believe that blockchain assets have seen the lows and that we\u2019re in the next bull market cycle \u2013 regardless of what happens in the interest-rate-sensitive asset classes.\u201d\n\nThat perspective differs from the majority in casting aside the debate over crypto price correlation with risk assets such as equities. As Cointelegraph continues to report, this forms the backbone of some other prognoses for 2023.\n\nMorehead argued that the drawdown from Bitcoin\u2019s latest all-time highs had placed the market well within the historical context, despite dipping below its previous bull market all-time high after the FTX debacle in November 2022.\n\n\u201cThe decline from November 2021 to November 2022 was the median of the typical cycle. This is the only bear market to more than completely wipe out the previous bull market. In this case, giving back 136% of the previous rally,\u201d he wrote, alongside accompanying data.\n\n\u201cThe median downdraft has been 307 days and the previous bear market was 376. The median drawdown has been a -73% downdraft and the latest bear market ended at -77%.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, a trend change will ensue, with Bitcoin on its way to fresh record highs.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re done with that and beginning to grind higher,\u201d Morehead added.\n\nBitcoin price cycles chart (screenshot). Source: Pantera Capital\n\nA \u201cjurisdiction-by-jurisdiction\u201d recovery\n\nSimilar optimism was directed at the decentralized finance space, with Pantera nonetheless positioning for a year of \u201crebuilding trust\u201d in centralized finance (CeFi) first and foremost.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price taps 3-week lows as SEC fears liquidate $250M of crypto longs\n\nThis would be necessary, Morehead claimed, in light of last year\u2019s multiple corporate failures, which precipitated the crypto bear market.\n\n\u201c2022 was a year of booms and major busts, especially as it pertains to CeFi. In the span of a few months, the world saw Three Arrows Capital collapse, Do Kwon\u2019s LUNA disintegrate, Voyager Digital go bankrupt, and Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s (SBF) FTX empire shatter,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cWhat did all these events have in common? The headlines like to suggest that it was crypto or Web3 that failed. But, in fact, it was a combination of bad actors skirting lines in jurisdictions without clear regulations. If 2022 was the year of breaking rules and failing, I believe 2023 is the year that entities instead follow the rules and enjoy the rewards of doing so.\u201d\n\nWhile the letter did not mention the current regulatory battle involving the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, it foresaw CeFi reclaiming its clout worldwide \u201con a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction level.\u201d\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "content": "The first production update of 2023 from publicly listed Bitcoin (BTC) mining companies shows a steady increase in hash rate and a surge in BTC production compared to the previous month, according to a new analysis from Hashrate Index.\n\nThe majority of public miners increased their bitcoin production in January, with CleanSpark boosting it by 50%, reaching a record monthly production of 697 Bitcoins. Leading the BTC production, Core Scientific reached 1,527 coins mined in January, followed by Riot, the second-biggest producer, mining 740 Bitcoins in the month.\n\nMarathon and Cipher have seen significant increases in Bitcoin production, reaching 687 and 343 Bitcoins generated, respectively, compared to 475 and 225 in December.\n\nPublic Miners: Monthly Bitcoin Production. Source: Hashrate Index and Luxor\n\nAccording to Bitcoin mining analyst Jaran Mellerud, better weather conditions in January and stable electricity prices helped miners boost production. \u201cIn December, a winter storm swept the North American continent and led to surging electricity prices that periodically forced many of these companies to curtail operations. With the weather more benevolent in January, electricity prices stabilized, and miners were able to achieve a higher up-time.\u201d\n\nHash rate increased for most public miners in January, but at a slower pace than expected. The exception is Texas-based Cipher, which boosted its hash rate by more than 50%, with a 4.3 EH/s. \u201cCipher has been building hard during this bear market, and I expect the company to reach its hashrate goal of 6 EH/s of self-mining capacity by the end of Q1 2023,\u201d wrote Mellerud.\n\nCleanSpark also grew its hash rate to 6.6 EH/s from 6.2 EH/s in December, following a series of acquisitions in late 2022. Hive also recorded growth in January, with its hash rate increasing by nearly 30%, from 2.1 to 2.7 EH/s. \u201cThe company keeps replacing its GPU fleet with ASICs, primarily with its in-house designed Buzzminers,\u201d Mellerud said of Hive.\n\nPublic Miners: Self-Mining Hashrate. Source: Hashrate Index and Luxor\n\nCore Scientific also continued growing its hash rate, reaching 17 EH/s in January from 15.7 in December. The figures, however, are expected to be impacted by the company's bankruptcy proceedings, which include a deal with the New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) to pay off an outstanding debt of $38.6 million by handing over more than 27,000 mining machines used as collateral - representing 18% of Core Scientific rigs.\n\nCore Scientific filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Dec. 21, seeking to reorganize its debts after months of financial distress due to increased electricity costs and low Bitcoin prices.\n\nMellerud also pointed out that \u201cthese companies have, on several occasions, extended the timeline of their lofty hashrate expansion goals. Most of them have plans to drastically increase their operating hashrate by the end of Q2 this year. At the current rate, most of them will likely have to push their expansion plans further into the future.\u201d"

However, one such significant contribution was found to carry an imperfection for over 12 years, invisible to the naked eye.\n\nOn Nov. 12, 2010, bitcointalk.org member bitboy (not related to YouTuber BitBoy Crypto) posted the vector files of the iconic Bitcoin logo, which has been widely accepted worldwide. While Bitcoiners preach the \u201czoom out\u201d narrative during crypto bear markets, zooming in on the original Bitcoin logo shows a small orange line from the background going into the white colored \u201c\u20bf.\u201d\n\nA small design detail that has stayed with many iterations of the original #bitcoin logo since its inception in 2010 pic.twitter.com/nYElwD2S6v \u2014 Doc (@_Bosch_) February 9, 2023\n\nThe information was first revealed by Crypto Twitter member @_Bosch_, who then shared an updated Bitcoin logo after removing the mark and improving the stylistic proportions. On further investigation, community member @skyler_fs found that one of the curvatures of the \u20bf logo was not smooth either.\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s investigation of the above claims confirmed the imperfections sported by the original Bitcoin vectors. The image below shows the two locations where the microscopic design issues exist.\n\nTwo imperfections found in the Bitcoin logo after 14 years. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nThe revelation does not impact how Bitcoin operates and community members have not shown any concerns about it. Even if someone were to create new vectors after fixing the flaws, it would not gain mainstream acceptance unless the community decides otherwise.\n\nRelated: Is it possible to achieve financial freedom with Bitcoin?\n\nAs markets maintain a positive trajectory toward recovery, Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark continues to amass equipment from distressed mining companies.\n\nCleanSpark\u2019s chief financial officer Gary Vecchiarelli said that the company envisions \u201cexplosive growth\u201d in 2023 through mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\u201cWith respect to our strategy regarding M&A, we have been one of the most active miners to date in acquiring infrastructure and machines, and we will continue to be active,\u201d he added."

        "title": "Understanding crypto bag holders and their mindset - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "For the first time in centuries, paper money, or fiat, found its true competition in the internet era. When Bitcoin (BTC) debuted in 2009, the fiat ecosystem was not only challenged with proving its worth in day-to-day transactions but also safekeeping the investment ecosystem it helped build.\n\nOver the years, the crypto ecosystem attracted people from all walks of life, serving their unique financial needs while filling the gaps left wide open by the fiat ecosystem. While most of the world watched from the sidelines \u2014 trying to decipher the true potential of cryptocurrencies \u2014 the first batch of Bitcoin millionaires swayed investors\u2019 attention toward the budding ecosystem.\n\nThe freedom to stick to what makes the most sense financially sprouted various classes of investors, each distinguished by their intent behind crypto investments. Based on the overall approach taken by investors, there are four main categories of mindsets of crypto bag holders: maximalists, hodlers, fomoers and traders.\n\nMaximalists\n\nFrom the day Bitcoin showcased its cross-border supremacy after being used as a currency on the dark web, numerous investors witnessed a true peer-to-peer monetary system for the first time. What followed was a pledge to stick with Bitcoin and see it overpower the centralized entities, bringing power back into the hands of the people.\n\nThis total support for Bitcoin and the belief that BTC is the only true replacement for the fiat economy gave birth to the term Bitcoin maximalism. Bitcoin maximalists have, time and again, advised the community members to hodl their assets during the bear market. They often recommend buying the dip \u2014 a process that involves investing in crypto during the market\u2019s poor performance. And over the last decade, the recommendation checks out.\n\n#Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy. \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) September 18, 2020\n\nHowever, maximalism is not limited to Bitcoin. It has spread widely across other crypto ecosystems too. Investors and crypto enthusiasts that have committed years to the growth of their preferred blockchains and cryptocurrencies have a belief pattern similar to Bitcoin maxis. Ether (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and XRP (XRP) are the few leading cryptocurrencies that have garnered loyal maximalists over the years that continue to preach the strength of their respective tokens.\n\nHODLers\n\nHodlers are the type of crypto investors that believe in making long-term investments. This type of investor does not fear the infamous volatile market fluctuations and instead focuses on accumulating cryptocurrency tokens over time.\n\nHodlers can be found across all crypto ecosystems and are known to be the most resilient of the bunch. For new Bitcoiners, the dream behind hodling is to accumulate at least one BTC over time. Through many halving cycles and the resultant scarcity, Bitcoin hodlers envision a future when their investments shell out a return unimaginable in a traditional fiat setting.\n\nThis dream seems more attainable for other cryptocurrencies considering that investors can accumulate a big bag of tokens using comparatively lower funds. Some millennials and generation z\u2019ers prefer purchasing thousands of meme tokens in the hopes of hitting the jackpot during bull markets.\n\nFOMOers\n\nFomoers are a subset of investors that end up making the biggest mistakes in investing. Fomo is an abbreviation of \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d implying a feeling of apprehension related to price movements.\n\nFomoers tend to react adversely to every market condition. When the price of cryptocurrencies goes up, these investors purchase more tokens hoping that the prices will continue to rise. However, this approach does not always yield fruitful results. As a result, they often end up buying the top and selling the bottom.\n\nRelated: Is it possible to achieve financial freedom with Bitcoin?\n\nTo get out of this mindset, one needs to study the market extensively while putting aside the noise of misinformation. Moreover, prominent crypto entrepreneurs often recommend against fomo-ing and ask the general public to focus on the bigger picture.\n\nTraders\n\nThese are the most straightforward investors that primarily focus on day-to-day prices in search of opportunities to earn profits. Traders closely monitor market sentiment, new developments and regulations to gauge how the markets react.\n\nRegardless of the prices going up or down, traders are ready to cash in on the market fluctuations by longing or shorting trades. The need for liquid tokens for trading requires traders to store a significant amount of their assets on crypto exchanges. However, the FTX fiasco of 2022 is a reminder that self-custody is the ideal way of storing cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn reality, every type of crypto holder can potentially make a lot of money buying and selling cryptocurrencies if they know the real strategy. Check out how Cointelegraph Markets Pro members managed to make 120x returns with the help of advanced machine learning algorithms and news indicators for trade opportunities."

        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs Soar Despite Polarizing Reception - NFT Plazas",
        "content": "Bitcoin NFTs Soar Despite Polarizing Reception\n\nNFTs and Bitcoin are rarely mentioned in the same breath; after all, the network doesn\u2019t support kind of smart contracts that have allowed the likes of Ethereum to handle non-fungible tokens. However, this has changed rapidly over the last month, ever since the Ordinals project appeared on January 21. The platform essentially allows users of the Bitcoin network to inscribe JPEGs and other data on satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin.\n\nThis deviation was made possible by the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade in November 2021, which allowed the storage of arbitrary data to a Satoshi\u2019s Witness. Ordinals has proven controversial within the Bitcoin space, with various factions debating the benefits and drawbacks to inscribing JPEGs and other data on its blockchain.\n\nBitcoin maxis see this as stupidity, given that it has increased bitcoin\u2019s block size, thus skyrocketing the transaction fees. According to research published by BitMEX on Wednesday, the sudden influx of JPEGs and other media files on the Bitcoin network has led to the consumption of 526 megabytes (MB) of block space, in addition to costing inscribers approximately 6.77 BTC, or $155,000, to date.\n\nOrdinals Data Up until 7 February 2023, we have identified: * Over 13,000 Ordinals transactions\n\n* 526MB of Bitcoin blockspace usage\n\n* 6.77 BTC of Ordinals related spendhttps://t.co/cSNHSPIEs3 \u2014 BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) February 8, 2023\n\nBitcoin NFTs Are Splitting Opinions\n\nRene Pickhardt, a longtime Bitcoiner, had stern words for Ordinals, accusing the project of spamming Bitcoin with JPEGs. Adam Back is also against Bitcoin NFTs, deeming them as a \u201csheer waste and stupidity of an ecoding.\u201d He can\u2019t help but wonder why people inscribing NFTs on Bitcoin can\u2019t do \u201csomething efficient.\u201d However, he realizes nothing can be done to stop them as Bitcoin is built to be censorship-resistant.\n\nOn-chain data expert, Data_Always, agrees, highlighting the rate at which blockspace consumption increases with every new Ordinals NFT inscription. In a tweet, he notes that \u201cSpending to inscribe Ordinals is climbing every day. Still only 12% of total fees and 0.3% of the subsidy, but the rise remains exponential. Biggest mempool backlog since FTX and 3AC collapses.\u201d\n\nHowever, others see Bitcoin NFTs as a good thing. Long-term Bitcoin supporter Dan Held says that the \u201cOrdinals is good for Bitcoin.\u201d Alex Adelman, cofounder and CEO of Lolli, seems to agree too. He sees the Ordinals as a \u201cmilestone for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHal Finney would like Bitcoin NFTs. pic.twitter.com/z4cO468pcA \u2014 Dan Held (@danheld) February 6, 2023\n\nBitcoin NFTs May Inspire Solutions To The Network\u2019s Problems\n\nDespite the fact that Bitcoin continues to lag behind Ethereum and Solana in terms of investment and talent dedicated to innovating and developing new applications, Bitcoin NFTs should attract a new wave of interest and capital. This will create opportunities for developers to build new solutions that aid with scalability and efficiency.\n\nThat said, since launch a few weeks ago, Ordinals has seen over 47,000 inscriptions as of press time, according to Dune Analytics. February 9 represented the busiest day, with over 22,000 inscriptions, with JPEG images, text, video, applications, and audio files are among the types of data that is being inscribed.\n\nWant more?

The company\u2019s bankruptcy comes mere weeks after Cash Cloud\u2019s biggest financial supporter, the crypto lender Genesis Global, also filed for bankruptcy, yet another victim of cryptocurrency\u2019s massive downturn over the past nine months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Las Vegas-based ATM vendor, which sells its line of Coin Cloud crypto machines in both the U.S. and Brazil, has only $50 million to $100 million in assets but has liabilities between $100 million to $500 million, according to its bankruptcy filing. The filing also says that the company has between 5,001 and 10,000 creditors. I\u2019m no Goldman Sachs intern, but I\u2019d say that seems bad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGizmodo reached out to Coin Cloud for comment and will update this story if it responds. In a statement provided to Cointelegraph, Chris McAlary, the founder and CEO of the company, said that the bankruptcy would allow it to \u201crework our debt, protect the interests of our creditors, and emerge as a stronger, more financially stable company.\u201d McAlary added that he was still \u201coptimistic about the future of the cryptocurrency industry.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the many crypto ATMs scattered throughout the U.S., Coin Cloud has played an important role, representing a 7.9% share of the nation\u2019s market overall, Axios writes. Of course, crypto\u2019s glowup is decidedly over now, replaced by a crypto winter, and it appears that Coin Cloud is one more victim of its long and destructive reach."

        "title": "Brendan Lee: Empowering users with Bitcoin and blockchain - CoinGeek",
        "content": "width=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nBrendan Lee is one of the Bitcoin SV enthusiasts who talk about Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset but because of its utility beyond the HODL attitude. Lee, the founder of Elas, was at the IEEE Blockchain Event at the University of Exeter to discuss the Bitcoin white paper, IPv6, Bitcoin, and their ongoing projects in the space.\n\nAfter his presentation, Lee talked to CoinGeek Backstage reporter Becky Liggero about why people should think of Bitcoin as a ledger instead of a coin or a store of value. Lee emphasized that owning a token isn\u2019t the main game of Bitcoin. Yes, you can possibly get rich with it, but building an application with more value generates the most revenue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about learning how to apply those tokens into an application and create something that has even more value\u2014potentially hundreds or thousands of times more value than the underlying tokens themselves. I expect that within a decade, the value of the objects being managed on the Bitcoin ledger will be a multiple like a hundred or a thousand off the actual value of the Bitcoin satoshis that are on the blockchain,\u201d he said.\n\nLee also shared their work within the industry, such as the Tuvalu project with Fai\u0101 and nChain, which started in 2020.\n\n\u201cIn a place like Tuvalu that has a paper-based system but doesn\u2019t have any trees, the use of paper is like a bit of friction on their economy. It costs a lot of money. So [we\u2019re] trying to look at ways to minimize that use of paper or remove it entirely and speed up the delivery of those services and to enhance the outcomes of the people who live in Tuvalu without completely disrupting the process,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to make the process work much faster, much quicker, much more cheaply so that people can get on with business,\u201d he noted.\n\nAnother project that Elas and Lee are working on is Tokenized Gold with an Australian company, Amleh Gold. Lee revealed that the idea for this project is to enable corporations to manage gold resources by building tokenized ownership records, potentially buying and selling them in the market, with an option to create a gold-backed currency in the BSV blockchain.\n\nOne of the themes at the IEEE in Exeter event was empowering businesses and people with IPv6 and blockchain; Liggero asked Lee how Elas allows this to happen.\n\n\u201c[Blockchain is] here to be a tool for them to improve the capacity of their departments and their systems to handle the demands of the people. And it\u2019s not by destroying the system that we empower people; it\u2019s by improving the system and making the system work ten times better and finding ways to optimize the processes that are being developed,\u201d he replied.\n\nAs for teaching the university students of Exeter about the fundamentals of Bitcoin and blockchain, Lee said that the first step is to study its foundation\u2014the Bitcoin white paper.\n\n\u201cFirst thing is to go through the Bitcoin white paper section by section,\u201d Lee remarked. \u201cI think the Bitcoin white paper is one of the most misunderstood documents of the last couple of decades\u2026What we\u2019re trying to do is to help them [students] to understand it in a way that will allow them to build things\u2026improve the systems or create all new systems that are ten times better than the ones that we use today,\u201d he said.\n\nWatch: Elas: Creating private, permissioned ledgers on the public blockchain\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs Trades for Six Figures amid OTC Trading on Spreadsheet - Tekedia",
        "content": "Lately there has been buzz on the Ordinals Bitcoin NFTs. Rodarmor, a prolific blockchain developer created the \u2018Ordinals\u2019 on Satoshi script a week ago on the Bitcoin network, presumably many believed Bitcoin is meant for processing payments and not as fungible tokens but through this new discovery, NFTS can now be inscribed on the chain with many notable derivatives such the original CryptoPunks and Bored Apes launching on the Ordinals protocol with high trading volumes, floor and bidding price.\n\nThe average price of a floor CryptoPunks NFT on the Ethereum mainnet is around 60 Eth or $90,000 but it is way more expensive on the Bitcoin chain, with Bitcoin Punks trading around six figures as most trades are executed on Spreadsheet via OTC trading.\n\nInterestingly, Leonidas an NFT Historian wrote an extensive Twitter thread explaining why he ventured into the Bitcoin NFTs narrative and what prompted him in spending 3.2 BTC (45 ETH) or $73,600 on Bitcoin Jpegs.\n\nTo put it simply, I\u2019ve fallen in love with the ordinals protocol. It\u2019s elegant, opinionated, and strives to bring digital objects to Bitcoin in a way that honors its ethos and values. I got to meet the founder back in September and am so proud of him. For those who don\u2019t know, every Bitcoin can be subdivided into 100,000,000 satoshis. Recently, Rodarmor found a way to associate a unique number with every satoshi so that they can be individually tracked and transferred. Then he took it a step further by developing a method for inscribing arbitrary data onto a satoshi. When you put all of this together it means that you can store any content that you want directly on Bitcoin and then transfer it to others. Want your art on Bitcoin? Just inscribe the JPEG. What about a song? Just inscribe the MP3. A website? Just inscribe the HTML. A video game? No problem, somebody already inscribed a fully functional game of Doom which you can play.\n\nSo far there are ~38,000 inscriptions and this number has been roughly doubling every day for the past week. However, interacting with the ordinals protocol is currently cumbersome as you need to run a full Bitcoin node and have minor technical skills.\n\nBut this is changing quickly, which is part of the reason why I\u2019m so excited about the future of ordinals. An organic ecosystem is forming and IMO it is inevitable that the infrastructure needed to onboard several orders of magnitude more people will get built out. Explorers, collections, inscription tools, wallets with a GUI (currently only has a CLI), and trustless marketplaces with a GUI (currently all trades are OTC) are all actively being developed.\n\nThis brings me to the Bitcoin Punks. As a Historical NFT collector, my thesis is that value will accrue asymmetrically to the collections that are early. I\u2019m not interested because they are punks (they could be anything) rather I care because they are low number inscriptions. Bitcoin Punks are 10,000 of the first 34,400 ordinal inscriptions. As a collector, this narrative resonates strongly with me.\n\nMy theory is that the more successful the ordinals protocol becomes, the more inscriptions there will be and thus the more rare and desirable the earliest inscribed collections will become. I think some people are missing the point by paying attention to the art/collection. In the future, quality will matter a lot more, just like it does for Ethereum, however, the ordinals market is currently predicated on low inscriptions having long-term collectible value. I believe that collectors will value the permanence of having art backed up forever to the Bitcoin blockchain, and think the high-end cryptoart market will eventually come to value what the Bitcoin brand adds to a collection but for now it\u2019s all about low inscription numbers.\n\nHowever, Davis KOL an ardent Bitcoin and Crypto Experimentalist at BasedKarbon, is not really happy with the Bitcoin NFT meta currently buzzing Twitter, he noted Bitcoin NFTs priced in eth, based on eth NFTs, and being wrapped in emblem vaults to sell on opensea has to be the stupidest nft meta we\u2019ve had so far;\n\nPriced in eth and emblem wrapped wouldn\u2019t be that dumb if the projects were original. I\u2019d understand the need to make the experience accessible and familiar. But copies of punks, a ripoff of a failed punk derivative, moonbird, Clones kinda clear which group is doing these gifts.\n\nBitcoinooooors have spent the last years alternately mocking NFTs and trying to get ETH regulated out of existence ex-post facto as a security, and now they want all the ETH NFT folks to basically seed them on their development of a Bitcoin NFT architecture.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "title": "We asked ChatGPT to explain Bitcoin in a rap song and it's dope - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The ChatGPT chatbot continues to gain prominence over its ability to handle different tasks by providing detailed responses and clear answers across various fields of expertise.\n\nSome of the emerging roles of the text-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool include offering specific crypto price predictions and writing songs with lyrics covering diverse themes and genres.\n\nIndeed, Finbold tasked ChatGPT with the role of explaining Bitcoin (BTC) in the form of rap music. As it stands, the tool did not disappoint by compressing all information about Bitcoin to align with the features of rap music.\n\nIn its explanation, ChatGPT incorporated elements such as rhyme schemes, repetition to emphasize certain points, and storytelling to creative wordplay.\n\nRapping about Bitcoin\n\nAt the start, the AI tool made it clear it was about to tell a story about Bitcoin, stressing that the asset is a real deal and not just a \u2018game\u2019:\n\n\u201cListen up, y\u2019all I got a story to tell About a currency that\u2019s making waves doing well It\u2019s called Bitcoin, and it\u2019s changing the game A decentralized system with no one to blame\u201d\n\nFor the chorus, ChatGPT summed up Bitcoin as secure, with no possibility of third-party interference, while noting that the maiden crypto is the \u2018future of gains\u2019.\n\nChatGPT Bitcoin rap lyrics. Source: ChatGPT\n\nUnder the second verse, the AI tool opted to offer a history lesson on the emergence of Bitcoin, highlighting the year of creation and the anonymity around the asset\u2019s innovator:\n\n\u201cIt started in 2009, with a mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto, the name of the innovator The idea was simple, create a new coin A digital currency that can easily be joined\u201d\n\nFurthemore, ChatGPT used its lyrical prowess to give a word of caution for investors hoping to get rich quickly by buying Bitcoin. The tool warned that crypto markets remain highly volatile and caution should be observed:\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not all sunshine, it\u2019s a volatile ride It can go up and down, you gotta hold on tight But it\u2019s a long-term play, not a get-rich-quick scheme Invest wisely, and you can make your dreams come true, it seems\u201d\n\nFinally, for the outro, ChatGPTs\u2019 Bitcoin rap sums up everything by advising on investing in the crypto and joining the revolution:\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the story of Bitcoin, a currency of the future, Join the revolution, don\u2019t be a loser, Invest wisely, and see your wealth grow, Bitcoin, Bitcoin, it\u2019s the way to go\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough ChatGPT rap lyrics appear entertaining, the tool does not miss the opportunity to educate about Bitcoin. From the lyrics, it\u2019s clear that the AI tool understands the potential benefits to risks associated with Bitcoin.\n\nThese attributes also play out when the tool is tasked with describing Bitcoin in other forms. For example, ChatGPT remained educational and comical when we asked to explain Bitcoin like a 1920s monster."

        "title": "How To Mine Bitcoin At Home - MacSources",
        "content": "Many people assume that mining Bitcoin requires a significant investment in expensive equipment, but that is not entirely accurate. Although the chances of earning a profit from mining Bitcoin at home are slim, it can serve as an excellent learning opportunity about the cryptocurrency. Additionally, there is always a chance, however small, of finding a block and receiving the 6.25 BTC block reward. This guide will explain the concept of Bitcoin mining, its mechanics, and how to mine at home.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Mining?\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of using specialized computer hardware to verify and record transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, and in return, miners are rewarded with newly minted bitcoins. When a user initiates a transaction on the Bitcoin network, it is broadcast to the network and grouped with other transactions into a block. Miners then compete to solve a complex mathematical puzzle to validate the block and add it to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the puzzle and validate the block is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins and transaction fees. This process of solving the puzzle and validating transactions is known as \u201cmining.\u201d\n\nCan Bitcoin Be Mined at Home PC?\n\nIt is possible to mine Bitcoin using a home PC, but it is not profitable. The process of mining Bitcoin requires significant computational power, and as the network has grown, the difficulty of mining has increased. This means that miners need to invest in specialized hardware, known as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), in order to have a chance of earning a profit. A home PC is not powerful enough to compete with specialized mining hardware, and the electricity costs associated with running a PC for an extended period of time would likely exceed any potential profits. It is still possible to mine Bitcoin using a home PC, but it would not be profitable and it\u2019s not recommended.\n\nHow to Set Up A Bitcoin Mining at Home\n\nSetting up a Bitcoin mining operation at home can be a complex and costly process. Here are the basic steps that you would need to take:\n\nPurchase mining hardware: In order to mine Bitcoin, you will need to invest in specialized mining hardware known as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These devices are specifically designed to mine Bitcoin and are much more powerful than a typical home PC. Set up a mining rig: A mining rig is a computer that is dedicated to mining Bitcoin. It typically consists of several ASICs, a power supply unit, and cooling system. You will need to assemble the rig and connect the ASICs to your computer. Join a mining pool: Mining Bitcoin alone can be difficult, as the chances of finding a block and earning the block reward are slim. Joining a mining pool allows you to combine your computing power with other miners, increasing your chances of earning a reward. Install mining software: Once your rig is set up, you will need to install mining software on your computer to connect to the mining pool and begin the process of mining Bitcoin. Monitor your progress: Keep track of your progress by monitoring the number of hashes per second your rig is producing, and the amount of Bitcoin you are earning. Calculate the cost: Take into account the cost of electricity, and make sure that the revenue from the mined bitcoin is covering the cost of electricity and the hardware.\n\nNote that, in order to make a profit, you will need to have a significant investment in specialized mining hardware and to be in a location with low cost electricity. Due to the high competition and the difficulty of mining, it\u2019s not recommendable to mine Bitcoin at home for profit.\n\nSo, Can I Make Money While Mining Bitcoin At Home?\n\nIt is possible to make money as an at-home miner, but it can be difficult due to the high cost of electricity and the need for specialized equipment. Additionally, the difficulty of mining for cryptocurrency has increased significantly in recent years, making it more difficult for individual miners to compete with large mining operations. However, if you have access to low-cost electricity and are willing to invest in specialized equipment, it may be possible to make a profit as an at-home miner. It\u2019s always better to do your own research (DYOR) and calculate the profitability before starting any mining operation.\n\nAnd Where Can I Sell Bitcoins That I\u2019ve Mined at Home?\n\nThere are several places where you can sell bitcoins that you\u2019ve mined at home. But the most popular option is \u2013 Cryptocurrency exchanges. Well-known exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Redot allow you to sell your bitcoins for fiat currency (e.g. USD, EUR) or other cryptocurrencies."
