        "title": "Bitcoin of America arrests: Ohio cryptocurrency kiosk operation - WKYC.com",
        "content": "More than 50 bitcoin ATMs were confiscated across Lorain and Cuyahoga counties.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nCLEVELAND \u2014 Three people and one business are being charged after allegedly owning and operating cryptocurrency kiosks illegally across Northeast Ohio.\n\nCuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O'Malley announced details of the operation during a Thursday press conference, saying two arrests happened in Chicago and one in Miami.\n\nThose arrested include the owner and founder of S&P Solutions, 45-year-old Sonny Meraban, 75-year-old Reza Meraban and 69-year-old William Suriano, an attorney for S&P Solutions.\n\nAuthorities say the company being charged -- S&P Solutions -- was doing business as Bitcoin of America.\n\nThe full press conference can be viewed below:\n\nTHE OPERATION\n\nOn Wednesday, March 1, numerous law enforcement agencies executed 54 search warrants across Cuyahoga and Lorain counties during an operation, which included 28 law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn total, 52 bitcoin machines operating under Bitcoin of America were confiscated across the two counties. 41 of the machines were found in Cuyahoga County and 11 in Lorain County.\n\n\"These ATMs were seized, 52 of them, yesterday from neighborhood gas stations mainly,\" said Andrew Rogalski, Economic Crime Supervisor and Assistant Prosecuting Attorney. \"These ATMs look like any other ATM. Essentially you put cash in and you tell the machine where you want to send cash that\u2019s converted into cryptocurrency that can go anywhere in the world usually by the means of a QR code or bar code that you can scan from your phone. These ATMs are ready-made for scammers. The scammers here, whether it\u2019s romance scams or law enforcement impersonators, will direct the victims, which are often times elderly or otherwise vulnerable, to specifically go to Bitcoin of American ATMs, take money that they\u2019ve withdrawn from their savings accounts or 401Ks, insert it into the Bitcoin machine and send it to a wallet that they\u2019ve been sent over the phone -- which they may think is their own wallet, but it really belongs to some third party that could be anywhere in the world.\"\n\nCHARGES\n\nAll three individuals as well as S and P Solutions are being charged with the exact same crimes, which are listed below:\n\nEngaging in a pattern of corrupt activity\n\nConspiracy\n\nMoney laundering (8 counts)\n\nReceiving stolen property (8 counts)\n\nCTS license requirement violation (33 counts)\n\nTampering with records (5 counts)\n\nPossessing criminal tools\n\nTaxation\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a new industry with cryptocurrency, but we\u2019re not dealing with new laws,\" Rogalski said. \"The same laws and the same legal theories apply to this business as any other businesses. Cryptocurrency is money. If you\u2019re a money transmitter in the state of Ohio, you need to have a license.\u201d\n\nTHE INVESTIGATION\n\nOfficials noted that one of the biggest problems was that Bitcoin of America was taking approximately 20 percent of the money deposited in each transaction at the bitcoin ATMs.\n\n\u201cOne of the main issues was certainly the machines not being licensed in the state of Ohio, and these individuals taking 20 percent of every transaction that occurred in the machine,\" said O'Malley. \"But these machines were also used to scam elderly people in Northeast Ohio, including eight victims who were led to these machines through fraudulent means to transfer funds.\u201d\n\nRogalski gave an example of an elderly gentleman being scammed in Northeast Ohio.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one instance where an elderly gentleman, within one hour, did three transactions at the same Bitcoin of America machine all in excess of $2,500 all to the same third-party wallet. That $11,250 was gone to him in a matter of seconds. So Bitcoin of America does little to prevent these transactions and then even less to help once the victim realizes that they are a victim of crime.\u201d\n\nAccording to Blaine Forschen, the United States Secret Service Special Agent in Charge, authorities began receiving reports from a number of elderly fraud victims being scammed by ATMs operated and owned by Bitcoin of America in September 2021, prompting an investigation. In October 2022, the task force and investigative unit presented the case to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office.\n\nOfficials believe that since 2018, Bitcoin of America has been evading numerous regulatory safeguards and financial compliance requirements in Ohio by \"misrepresenting the company\u2019s role in transferring funds through cryptocurrency.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin, ether slide on Friday as investors weigh potential fallout from Silvergate woes - CNBC",
        "content": "A pedestrian walks past signage for Ethereum, top, and Bitcoin outside the Hong Kong Digital Asset Exchange Ltd. digital currency trading store in Hong Kong, China, on Thursday, June 24, 2021.\n\nThe drop came late Thursday night, hours after several crypto companies said they'd stopped accepting or initiating payments to or from Silvergate \u2013 including Coinbase, Galaxy Digital, Circle, Paxos and Bitstamp. Silvergate, which has become the go-to bank for cryptocurrency businesses, gave notice Wednesday that it won't meet an extended deadline to file its annual report and warned it may not be able to operate another 12 months.\n\nBitcoin dipped by more than 5% to $22,261.22, according to Coin Metrics. Ether lost 5.5% and traded at $1,555.37.\n\nCryptocurrency prices fell on Friday as investors weighed the latest financial woes at Silvergate Capital and assessed what a potential bankruptcy at the crypto bank could mean for the broader crypto industry.\n\n\"To start 2023, crypto markets enjoyed a solid rally to six-month highs following a slowdown in FTX-related contagion, but the Silvergate news has renewed concerns around liquidity and risk,\" Medalie added.\n\n\"The bearish turn could certainly be a delayed reaction to Silvergate's ongoing issues,\" said Clara Medalie director of research at Kaiko. \"Many large exchanges and market makers partner with Silvergate for fast transactions between entities, and any halt inactivity could have an impact on global crypto liquidity.\"\n\nBitcoin has recovered this year after tumbling more than 60% in 2022 to below $17,000 amid the pullback in risk assets and the implosion of FTX, which was a Silvergate customer. Even after the recent decline, bitcoin is up more than 30% this year \u2014 though it could be in for a month of sideways trading now that the broader rally in risk assets has faded.\n\nCrypto market resilience\n\nAnalysts said the Silvergate woes weren't an obvious trigger for the drop in bitcoin and ether. They also pointed to liquidations, macro factors and technical indicators.\n\n\"Overnight, bitcoin dropped below $23,000, hitting its lowest level in two weeks. In the process, traders were hit by millions of long liquidations,\" Medalie said.\n\nYuya Hasegawa, an analyst at Japanese crypto firm Bitbank, said that drop happened \"without a clear trigger.\" Noelle Acheson, economist and author of the \"Crypto is Macro Now\" newsletter, echoed the point about liquidations.\n\n\"The fact that it was a short and sharp dump, and that bitcoin and ether prices are now bouncing along steadily, suggests that the move was largely structural, and that the market still has considerable resilience,\" she said.\n\nThat resilience was a big takeaway for investors from the February trading month, in which bitcoin and ether suffered a brief drop of 6% and 8.5%, respectively, as U.S. financial regulators began their crypto crackdown. Bitcoin went on to finish the month les than 1% above the flatline, while ether eked out a roughly 2% gain.\n\nGiven the bad news and the ongoing recovery from the FTX debacle in November, investors saw that as a win even though the crypto assets failed to match their double digit January returns.\n\n\"The Silvergate news is really bad, but should not directly affect bitcoin holdings,\" Acheson added. \"It could spook some macro investors, however, who could withdraw and wait for this to blow over.\"\n\nJoel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, pointed to bitcoin's recent inability to \"establish above critical technical resistance in the form of the August 2022 high around $25,200\" and \"global inflation data that continues to suggest central banks, particularly the Fed, will need to keep with a less investor-friendly monetary policy track of higher for longer\" \u2013 in addition to the Silvergate scare.\n\nIf bitcoin fails to hold the $22,000 level, the next stop will likely be around $21,400, where the February low and November high converge, according to Hasegawa."

        "content": "CLEVELAND \u2014 The Cuyahoga County Prosecutor\u2019s office and the Secret Service Field Office in Cleveland unsealed an indictment in a major cryptocurrency scam on Thursday.\n\nThree individuals and one business are indicted on a charge of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity among several other charges for operating cryptocurrency kiosks in Northeast Ohio. In total, 30 law enforcement offices were involved with the investigation.\n\nA Cuyahoga County grand jury returned an indictment, charging S and P Solutions, which operates as Bitcoin of America, the founder Sonny Meraban, 45, his father and manager of the company Sonny Meraban, 75, and their attorney William Suriano, 69.\n\nThey are all charged with one count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, one count of conspiracy, eight counts of money laundering, eight counts of receiving stolen property, 33 counts of license requirement violation, five counts of tampering with records, one count of possessing criminal tools and one count of taxation.\n\nWednesday, police agencies seized 52 Bitcoin of America ATMS in mostly neighborhood gas stations throughout Lorain and Cuyahoga counties.\n\nPolice arrested Sonny Meraban at his home in Miami and the two other men near the Chicago area.\n\nIn 2021, Bitcoin of America\u2019s profits from cash deposits in Ohio was more than 3.5 million, according to investigators. BOA operates over 2,600 crypto ATMs across 35 states and is the 4th largest cryptocurrency ATM in the nation.\n\nBlaine Forschen, the United States Secret Service special agent in charge, said shortly after Bitcoin of America\u2019s ATMs began popping up in Ohio, complaints came in.\n\n\u201cThe investigation revealed, since 2018, Bitcoin of America has evaded numerous regulatory safe guards and financial compliance requirements in Ohio by misrepresenting the company\u2019s role in transferring funds by cryptocurrency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the pathway for money to go from the victims to the scammers, unregulated and unmonitored.\u201d\n\nInvestigators revealed the first issue is that the ATMs are not properly licensed in Ohio.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with a new industry of cryptocurrency but we are not dealing with new laws,\u201d said Andrew Rogalski, the economic crime supervisor at the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. \u201cCryptocurrency is money. if you\u2019re a money transmitter in the State of Ohio, you need to have a license. Bitcoin of America does not have a license.\u201d\n\nForschen added the company misrepresented its money transfer capabilities to avoid Ohio regulators and because of the lack of regulations, BOA became attractive to scammers.\n\n\u201cBecause of their lack of money-laundering safeguards, criminals around the world have utilized the company to receive victim payments and launder elicit funds to criminals, both in the U.S. and across the world. Scammers, robocallers, international organized crime groups have capitalized on the company\u2019s lack of compliance and licensing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added victims, unknowingly, sent money to organized crime groups in Russia and other foreign countries.\n\nInvestigators stated that Bitcoin of America takes 20% of every transaction without revealing it to users beforehand.\n\n\u201cThe money that goes into the Bitcoin of America machine is deposited into the company\u2019s out-burning account, whether it\u2019s a legitimate transaction or an illegitimate transaction, Bitcoin of America retains the 20% as profit,\u201d said Rogalski.\n\nHe added even when the company had users call and report their money gone, BOA never returned its own 20% profit.\n\nThe indictment shows eight victims in Northeast Ohio were scammed out of tens of thousands.\n\nBut Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O\u2019Malley said he\u2019s confident there are many more victims and encourages anyone who believes they have been scammed to contact your local police department and file a report on the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s website.\n\nWatch live and local news any time:\n\nNews 5 at 11\n\nDownload the News 5 Cleveland app now for more stories from us, plus alerts on major news, the latest weather forecast, traffic information and much more.

        "title": "Amid value drops and increased regulation, what\u2019s the future of cryptocurrency? - PBS NewsHour",
        "content": "In the span of a few years, cryptocurrencies have grown from digital novelties to trillion-dollar technologies with the potential to disrupt the global financial system. Bitcoin and hundreds of other cryptocurrencies are increasingly held as investments and used as currencies to buy a swath of goods and services, such as software, digital real estate, and illegal drugs.\n\nTo their proponents, cryptocurrencies are a democratizing force, wresting the power of money creation and control from central banks and Wall Street. Critics, however, say that a lack of regulation for cryptocurrencies empowers criminal groups, terrorist organizations, and rogue states, while the assets themselves stoke inequality, suffer from drastic market volatility, and consume vast amounts of electricity.\n\nRegulations vary considerably around the world, with some governments embracing cryptocurrencies and others banning or limiting their use. As of February 2023, 114 countries, including the United States, are considering introducing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to compete with the cryptocurrency boom.\n\nWhat are cryptocurrencies?\n\nSo called for their use of cryptography principles to mint virtual coins, cryptocurrencies are typically exchanged on decentralized computer networks between people with virtual wallets. These transactions are recorded publicly on distributed, tamper-proof ledgers known as blockchains. This open-source framework prevents coins from being duplicated and eliminates the need for a central authority such as a bank to validate transactions.\n\nBitcoin, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous software engineer Satoshi Nakamoto, is by far the most prominent cryptocurrency, and its market capitalization has peaked at over $1 trillion. Numerous others, including Ethereum, the second-most popular, have proliferated in recent years.\n\nCryptocurrency users send funds between digital wallet addresses. These transactions are then recorded into a sequence of numbers known as a \u201cblock\u201d and confirmed across the network. Blockchains do not record real names or physical addresses, only the transfers between digital wallets, and thus confer a degree of anonymity on users. Some cryptocurrencies, such as Monero, claim to provide additional privacy. However, if the identity of a wallet owner becomes known, their transactions can be traced.\n\nWATCH: After $2 trillion crypto crash, what happens next?\n\nBitcoin \u201cminers\u201d earn coins by organizing these blocks, thereby validating transactions on the network; the process requires a system known as \u201cproof of work,\u201d based on using computers to solve math problems. Many cryptocurrencies use this method, but Ethereum and some others instead use a validation mechanism known as \u201cproof of stake.\u201d\n\nIn Bitcoin\u2019s case, a transaction block is added to the chain every ten minutes, at which point new Bitcoin is awarded. (The reward decreases steadily over time.) The total supply of Bitcoin is capped at twenty-one million coins, but not all cryptocurrencies have such a constraint.\n\nThe prices of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies vary based on global supply and demand. However, the values of some cryptocurrencies are fixed because they are backed by other assets, thus earning them the name \u201cstablecoins.\u201d While these coins tend to claim a peg to a traditional currency, such as $1 per coin, many such currencies were knocked from their pegs during a spate of volatility in 2022.\n\nWhy are they popular?\n\nOnce dismissed as a fringe interest of tech evangelists, cryptocurrencies\u2014particularly Bitcoin\u2014have skyrocketed to mainstream popularity and trillion dollar valuations. In November 2021, the price of Bitcoin surged to more than $60,000 for the first time. (By February 2023, it had fallen to $23,000.) As of mid 2022, an estimated 20 percent of U.S. adults polled by NBC News had invested in, traded, or used cryptocurrency.\n\nDifferent currencies have different appeals, but the popularity of cryptocurrencies largely stems from their decentralized nature: They can be transferred relatively quickly and anonymously, even across borders, without the need for a bank that could block the transaction or charge a fee. Dissidents in authoritarian countries have raised funds in Bitcoin to circumvent state controls, including to avoid U.S. sanctions on Russia.\n\nSome experts say that digital assets are primarily tools for investment. People buy cryptocurrencies \u201cbecause of a speculative belief that these tokens are going to go up in the future, because a new future is being built on the blockchain,\u201d says CFR Senior Fellow Sebastian Mallaby. \u201cIt\u2019s a very risky bet, as the last 12 months have shown.\u201d\n\nANAL YSIS: Crypto companies\u2019 ties to sports raise ethical questions\n\nThe price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fluctuates wildly, and some experts say this limits their usefulness as a means of transaction. (Most buyers and sellers don\u2019t want to accept payment in something whose value can change dramatically from day to day.) Nevertheless, some businesses accept Bitcoin. Many investors see Bitcoin as a speculative asset to hold over time, rather than make payments with, and it often draws comparisons to gold. Some see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation because the supply is permanently fixed unlike those of fiat currencies, which central banks can expand indefinitely.\n\nHowever, after Bitcoin plummeted amid stock market volatility in 2022, many experts questioned this argument. The valuation of other cryptocurrencies can be harder to explain, though many are associated with a larger project within the digital asset industry. Some cryptocurrencies, such as Dogecoin, were created as jokes, but have retained value and garnered investment from high profile investors.\n\nIn countries with historically weak currencies, including several Latin American and African countries, Bitcoin has become popular with populist leaders. In 2021, El Salvador made waves by becoming the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender (residents can pay taxes and settle debts with it), though the move has sparked protests. Some politicians in other parts of the region have expressed support for the idea.\n\nStablecoins, meanwhile, have the potential to rival fiat currencies as the dominant form of payments, experts say. Their value is relatively stable, and they can be sent instantly without the transaction fees associated with credit cards or international remittance services such as Western Union.\n\nIn addition, because stablecoins can be used by anyone with a smartphone, they represent an opportunity to bring millions of people who lack traditional bank accounts into the financial system. However, they have drawn increased scrutiny from regulators, especially after several stablecoins sunk below their $1 pegs during 2022\u2019s market volatility.\n\nWhat is \u201cDeFi\u201d?\n\nCryptocurrencies and blockchains have given rise to a new constellation of \u201cdecentralized finance\u201d or DeFi businesses and projects. Essentially the cryptocurrency version of Wall Street, DeFi aims to offer people access to financial services\u2014borrowing, lending, and trading\u2014without the need for legacy institutions such as banks and brokerages, which often take large commissions and other fees.\n\nInstead, \u201csmart contracts\u201d automatically execute transactions when certain conditions are met. DeFi is surging in popularity, with investors pouring tens of billions of dollars into the sector.\n\nMost DeFi apps are built on the Ethereum blockchain. Because of its usefulness in tracking transactions, blockchain technology has a range of potential applications beyond cryptocurrency, experts say, such as facilitating real estate deals and international trade.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine a new kind of financial system being constructed out of blockchain-based tokens that have advantages over the old, centralized kinds of money. You trust the code, and you trust the blockchain and the decentralized ledger, and it\u2019s a new way of organizing finance,\u201d says CFR\u2019s Mallaby.\n\nWhat challenges has this created?\n\nCryptocurrencies have also given rise to a new set of challenges for governments to contend with, including concerns over criminal activity, environmental harms, and consumer protection.\n\nIllicit activities\n\nIn recent years, cybercriminals have increasingly carried out ransomware attacks, by which they infiltrate and shut down computer networks and then demand payment to restore them, often in cryptocurrency. Drug cartels and money launderers are also \u201cincreasingly incorporating virtual currency\u201d into their activities, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency\u2019s (DEA) most recent annual assessment.\n\nU.S. and European authorities have shut down a number of so-called darknet markets\u2014websites where anonymous individuals can use cryptocurrency to buy and sell illegal goods and services, primarily narcotics. Critics say these enforcement efforts have fallen short, exemplified by the theft of over $1 billion in cryptocurrency by a North Korean hacking group in 2022.\n\nTerrorism and sanctions evasion\n\nThe primacy of the U.S. dollar has provided the United States unrivaled power to impose crippling economic sanctions. However, states including Iran, North Korea, and Russia are increasingly using cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions. Meanwhile, terrorist groups such as the self-proclaimed Islamic State, al-Qaeda, and the military wing of the Palestinian organization Hamas also traffic in cryptocurrency.\n\nEnvironmental harms\n\nBitcoin mining is an enormously energy-intensive process: the network now consumes more electricity than many countries. This has sparked fears about the cryptocurrency\u2019s contribution to climate change. Cryptocurrency proponents say this problem can be solved using renewable energy; El Salvador\u2019s president has pledged to use volcanic energy to mine Bitcoin, for example. Environmental concerns reportedly prompted Ethereum\u2019s move to a proof of stake model, which uses less energy.\n\nVolatility and lack of regulation\n\nThe rapid rise of cryptocurrencies and DeFi enterprises means that billions of dollars in transactions are now taking place in a relatively unregulated sector, raising concerns about fraud, tax evasion, and cybersecurity, as well as broader financial stability. If cryptocurrencies become a dominant form of global payments, they could limit the ability of central banks, particularly those in smaller countries, to set monetary policy through control of the money supply.\n\nAfter high levels of volatility diminished the value of several prominent cryptocurrencies in 2022, a handful of crypto firms were unable to pay back their lenders, which were primarily other crypto firms. Many borrowers and lenders declared bankruptcy, including FTX, at the time the world\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange. The collapse of FTX and other firms resulted in tens of billions of dollars in losses to investors, though traditional financial firms were relatively unscathed.\n\nWhat are governments doing about this?\n\nMany governments have taken a hands-off approach to crypto, but its rapid ascent and evolution, coupled with the rise of DeFi, has forced regulators to begin crafting rules for the emerging sector. Regulations vary widely around the world, with some governments embracing cryptocurrencies and others banning them outright. The challenge for regulators, experts say, is to develop rules that limit traditional financial risks without stifling innovation.\n\nIn the United States, policymakers have indicated they are slowly moving to regulate cryptocurrencies and the emerging DeFi sector. However, cryptocurrencies do not fit neatly into the existing regulatory framework, creating ambiguity that lawmakers will likely have to resolve. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler has called the cryptocurrency sector a \u201cWild West,\u201d and urged Congress to give the SEC greater powers.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have both called for stronger regulations of stablecoins. But regulators have thus far been reluctant to extend crypto investors the same protections that exist in more traditional finance, such as deposit insurance. \u201cIf you buy crypto-assets and the price goes to zero at some point, please don\u2019t be surprised and don\u2019t expect taxpayers to socialize your losses,\u201d the Federal Reserve Board of Governors\u2019 Christopher J. Waller said in 2023.\n\nWATCH: The effects of FTX\u2019s collapse on the cryptocurrency industry\n\nTo limit illicit activities, authorities have targeted the exchanges that allow users to convert cryptocurrencies to U.S. dollars and other national currencies. Under pressure from regulators, major exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, and Gemini adhere to \u201cknow your customer\u201d and other anti\u2013money laundering requirements. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies, meanwhile, have learned to leverage the traceability of most cryptocurrencies by using blockchains to analyze and track criminal activity.\n\nFor example, some of the ransom paid to the Colonial Pipeline hackers was later recovered by the FBI. In August 2022, the Treasury Department announced a crackdown on so-called cryptocurrency mixers that criminals can use to anonymize transactions on the blockchain, calling them a \u201cthreat to U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nChina, which accounts for most of the world\u2019s Bitcoin mining, has moved aggressively to crack down on cryptocurrencies. In September 2021, Chinese authorities announced a sweeping ban on all crypto transactions and mining, causing the price of some cryptocurrencies to fall sharply in the immediate aftermath.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Law Library of Congress, eight other countries (Algeria, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, and Tunisia) have banned cryptocurrencies, while dozens more have sought to restrict adoption of digital assets. Still, most governments have so far taken a relatively limited approach.\n\nWhat is a central bank digital currency?\n\nIn an effort to assert sovereignty, many central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, are considering introducing their own digital cash, known as a central bank digital currency (CBDC). For proponents, CBDCs promise the speed and other benefits of cryptocurrency without the associated risks. Dozens of countries\u2014together representing more than 90 percent of the global economy\u2014are exploring CBDCs.\n\nEleven countries have fully launched CBDCs. All are lower-income and ten are in the Caribbean (Nigeria is the 11th). Since piloting a digital yuan in 2019, China is now expected to extend its CBDC pilot program to its population of over one billion by the end of 2023. In the United States, there is reportedly disagreement among Fed officials over the need for a digital dollar.\n\nREAD MORE: Why the U.S. is eyeing a digital dollar\n\nExperts say interest in CBDCs intensified in 2019 when Facebook announced it would create its own digital currency called Libra, potentially offering a new payment option for its more than two billion users. (The company has since scaled back the project, renamed Diem.) China is another motivating factor: A digital yuan could give Beijing even more control over its economy and citizens, and threaten the U.S. dollar\u2019s status as the favored international reserve currency, experts say.\n\nOne way to implement CBDCs would be for citizens to have accounts directly with the central bank. This would give governments powerful new ways of managing the economy\u2014stimulus payments and other benefits could be credited to people directly, for example\u2014and the central bank\u2019s imprimatur would make CBDCs a safe digital asset to hold. But their introduction could also create new problems, experts say, by centralizing an enormous amount of power, data, and risk within a single bank and potentially compromising privacy and cybersecurity.\n\nSome experts say the potential for CBDCs to cut out commercial banks as intermediaries carries risks, because these banks perform a critical economic role by creating and allocating credit (i.e., making loans). If people chose to bank directly with the Fed, that would require the central bank to either facilitate consumer borrowing, which it might not be equipped to do, or find new ways of injecting credit. For these reasons, some experts say private, regulated digital currencies are preferable to CBDCs."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) fell more than 5% from $23,500 to $22,240 in just over 60 minutes on March 3, amid a wave of uncertainty concerning crypto-friendly bank Silvergate Capital.\n\nThe price drop wiped $22 billion from Bitcoin\u2019s total market capitalization, which is now at $430.9 billion, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro.\n\nEther (ETH), XRP (XRP), Cardano (ADA), MATIC (MATIC) and other non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies also suffered a similar sharp decline.\n\nBitcoin just dropped $1200 in less than 30 minutes. \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) March 3, 2023\n\nMarkus Thielen, the head of research at digital asset platform Matrixport, told Cointelegraph that he believes the price fall is linked to the recent Silvergate Bank controversy with its delayed annual 10-K financial report filing, in addition to an increased effort by United States regulators attempting to restrict ties between banks and crypto firms:\n\n\u201cThe drop is due to the continuous fallout from Silvergate Bank, as there is now more uncertainty about fiat on-and-off ramp. In addition, there are now wider industry concerns that U.S. regulators are trying to cut off further banking relationships between crypto firms and FDIC-insured banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cNevertheless, this is playing into the hands of Hong Kong and China, which are becoming more crypto-friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have seen an increase in stablecoin activity as a sign that crypto firms are using crypto rails to move money around,\u201d he added.\n\nSeveral technical analysts on Twitter claimed to have predicted the fall from the $23,000 resistance.\n\nBitcoin price chart. Source: Cointelegraph Markets Pro.\n\nThe last time BTC was priced at $22,250 was Feb. 15.\n\nThe sharp fall comes despite a solid start to 2023, with BTC still up 34.8% for the year. It was changing hands at $16,550 on Jan. 1.\n\nEther has also fallen 4.74% from $1,644 to $1,566, causing a $9 billion wipeout from its market cap over the first hour."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies and volatility go hand in hand, but when it came to the leading cryptocurrency bitcoin, there was less volatility as more traditional assets were racked with inflation fears and rising interest rates during the month of February.\n\n\u201cBitcoin moved just 0.03% last month in United State dollar terms, making February 2023 likely its least volatile in history,\u201d a Cointelegraph article noted as the cryptocurrency was traded within the $22,000 to $24,000 price level. \u201cData from Coinglass after the monthly close confirms that BTC/USD went practically nowhere for four weeks straight.\u201d\n\nMoreover, bitcoin\u2019s price is actually up over 40% year-to-date compared to the S&P 500\u2019s gain of 3.4%. The leading cryptocurrency\u2019s price fell over 60% last year, making it a volatile experience for investors as it followed stocks and bonds downward amid inflationary and monetary policy tightening pressures.\n\nThat same correlation is spilling over into this year as markets push to rally though inflation and rising rate fears have crept back into the capital markets once again. As such, digital and traditional assets will once again remain fixated on the U.S. Federal Reserve with respect to monetary policy decisions for the rest of the year.\n\nThe Fed is aware that inflation won\u2019t be going away anytime soon. Still, the lack of volatility during the month of February shows bitcoin\u2019s maturation as an asset, especially with an influx of more institutional investors flooding the space.\n\nImproving Risk Appetite\n\nDespite interest rate fears, the global economy has been humming along, pushed even further with China\u2019s reopening after the country dealt with a rise in COVID-19 cases. China\u2019s recent macroeconomic data increased an appetite for risk, lifting bitcoin higher recently.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s official manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 52.6 in February, the highest in over a decade, following January\u2019s 50.1, according to data released on Wednesday,\u201d Coindesk reported. \u201cA reading above 50 indicates an expansion of activity. Non-manufacturing PMI rose to 56.3 from January\u2019s print of 54.4.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe positive news out of China, the world\u2019s factory and largest trading partner of the U.S. and Germany, pushed the U.S. dollar lower against major currencies, lifting risk assets like bitcoin and stocks higher,\u201d the report added.\n\nMeanwhile, bullish bitcoin investors appear to be those who are looking beyond the short term. A Barron\u2019s article noted that bitcoin has been seeing continuous buying from investors with a long-term horizon, confirming that it could still be an opportune time to buy the leading cryptocurrency and hold it for the long term.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "title": "Should You Buy Bitcoin While It's Still Below $25,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "For the first two months of 2023, Bitcoin (BTC 1.52%) has been on a remarkable run. It's now up 41.45% for the year, and trades at just over $23,479. But there are signs that Bitcoin is running out of momentum as it tests the $25,000 mark.\n\nWhile Bitcoin briefly touched the $25,000 level in mid-February, it quickly gave up those gains. And the last time Bitcoin flirted with the $25,000 level back in August 2022, it eventually sank below the $18,000 mark. As a result, the consensus now is that $25,000 is a very important price level for Bitcoin. So can Bitcoin break through the $25,000 level or not?\n\nShort-term outlook\n\nIf you are only taking a short-term outlook, of course, things look particularly dicey for Bitcoin. Everybody is watching the Federal Reserve right now for signs of further monetary tightening. If the Federal Reserve continues to raise rates in order to tame inflation, the thinking goes, then Bitcoin is going to have a tough time breaking through the $25,000 level. At some point, the Fed might trigger a recession, and that's not going to help Bitcoin at all.\n\nMoreover, the price of Bitcoin is now increasingly correlated with the performance of big tech stocks. Over the past 90 days, the correlation of Bitcoin with the tech-heavy Nasdaq is 0.75. This suggests that, while crypto is not marching in lock-step with big tech companies, it is marching at about the same tempo. If you've been following all the layoffs happening in Silicon Valley recently, this is not good news for crypto. It suggests that a real rebound in Bitcoin won't happen until the tech industry fully recovers.\n\nLong-term outlook\n\nHowever, if you take a long-term perspective, the outlook for Bitcoin brightens significantly. The case for Bitcoin global adoption is hard to deny. Just about every head-spinning price prediction made for Bitcoin -- such as Bitcoin at $500,000 or Bitcoin at $1 million -- is based on some scenario in which Bitcoin becomes relatively ubiquitous on a worldwide level.\n\nWhen Cathie Wood and Ark Invest came up with a revised $1.48 million price target for Bitcoin this year, it was based on the assumption that Bitcoin would see tremendous growth in eight key areas. For example, in emerging markets, Bitcoin will eventually represent a greater and greater share of the M2 money supply, a common measure of the money supply. Amongst institutional investors, Bitcoin will account for a larger and larger share of total portfolio holdings. At the same time, Bitcoin will increasingly be held on corporate balance sheets, used for cross-border remittances, and held as a form of \"digital gold.\"\n\nBut that's just part of the global adoption story for Bitcoin. As Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper pointed out in his $250,000 price prediction, Bitcoin will become more and more ubiquitous as a form of payment. Just about anything you buy online will be paid via Bitcoin, predicts Draper. While this scenario might take quite a bit of time to play out, the fact remains that more than one-half of adult Americans now own crypto or have owned it in the past.\n\nAnd, finally, new use cases for Bitcoin continue to emerge. With each new use case, the valuation of Bitcoin will only continue to increase. The one use case that has everyone buzzing now is the ability to store non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain. These NFTs, known as Ordinals, may only be a passing fad -- or they could be part of a new era for Bitcoin, in which its blockchain is eventually used for much more than just financial transaction processing.\n\nShould you buy Bitcoin?\n\nUltimately, the choice of whether to buy Bitcoin comes down to how you view the market. If you only take a short-term view of the market, then Bitcoin may not look like an attractive buy right now. Why take on all the risk, volatility, and uncertainty of crypto when you can just buy a big tech stock in the Nasdaq?\n\nHowever, if you are taking a long-term view of the market, then Bitcoin below $25,000 looks like a screaming buy. The future growth prospects of Bitcoin just look too good to ignore. While the price of Bitcoin might never reach the $1 million mark, it's hard to see how Bitcoin won't again make a run at its all-time high of $68,789.63. At today's prices, that would represent a nearly 200% return on your investment."

        "title": "The Psychology of Bitcoin Investment: The Fear, FOMO, and Greed Cycle - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world's first decentralized digital currency, has taken the financial world by storm since its creation in 2009. While some see it as a revolutionary new way to store and transfer value, others view it as a speculative bubble that is doomed to burst.\n\nWhatever your viewpoint, it is undeniable that Bitcoin is a highly volatile and unpredictable asset that can elicit strong emotions in investors. In this article, we'll look at the psychology of Bitcoin investment and the fear, FOMO, and greed cycle that can lead to irrational decisions by investors.\n\nFear of Missing Out (FOMO)\n\nFOMO is a strong psychological phenomenon that can affect investors of all skill levels. Fear of missing out on potential profits can lead investors to make rash and impulsive decisions, such as purchasing Bitcoin at exorbitant prices or investing more than they can afford to lose.\n\nFOMO is frequently fueled by social media and news coverage of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nKeep Reading Will Blockchain Technology Mark a Turning Point in Fraud Prevention?\n\nFOMO can be especially intense in the world of Bitcoin where prices can change dramatically in a matter of hours or even minutes. When the price of Bitcoin is rapidly rising, investors may feel compelled to invest before missing out on potential profits.\n\nThis can lead to a self-fulfilling cycle in which rising prices fuel even more FOMO, resulting in even higher prices.\n\nFear of Financial Loss\n\nAnother powerful emotion that can drive Bitcoin investors to make irrational decisions is fear of losing money. While all investments involve some level of risk, the volatility of Bitcoin can be particularly intimidating for some investors.\n\nWhen the price of Bitcoin falls rapidly, investors may panic and sell their holdings in order to avoid further losses.\n\nThis fear can be exacerbated by media coverage of Bitcoin crashes and stories of large sums of money lost by investors.\n\nWhile it is critical to manage risk when investing in Bitcoin, it is also critical to remember that all investments involve some level of risk and that Bitcoin has a history of recovering from price drops.\n\nGreed\n\nAnother emotion that can lead Bitcoin investors to make irrational decisions is greed. When the price of Bitcoin rises rapidly, investors may become overconfident and invest more than they can afford to lose. This can create a self-fulfilling cycle in which rising prices fuel even more greed, resulting in even higher prices.\n\nAdditionally, greed can drive investors to make irrational and impulsive decisions, such as investing in unproven or untested Bitcoin-related projects or scams. While it is important to be optimistic about the future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it is also critical to remain rational and skeptical when evaluating investment opportunities.\n\nThe Cycle of Fear, FOMO, and Greed\n\nFear, FOMO, and greed are self-perpetuating cycles that can lead Bitcoin investors to make irrational decisions. When the price of Bitcoin is rapidly rising, investors may feel compelled to invest before they miss out on potential profits (FOMO).\n\nThis can result in overconfidence and irrational investing decisions (greed), which can then result in panic selling when prices begin to fall (fear).\n\nThis cycle is especially dangerous for inexperienced investors who are new to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. It is critical to remember that Bitcoin is a highly volatile and unpredictable asset that can be influenced by a variety of factors ranging from global economic conditions to media coverage and investor sentiment.\n\nKeeping Your Emotions in Check When Investing in Bitcoin\n\nWhen investing in Bitcoin, managing your emotions is critical for long-term success. Here are some pointers to help you manage your emotions when investing in Bitcoin:\n\nKeep up to date: Keep up to date on the latest Bitcoin and cryptocurrency news and developments. This can assist you in making informed decisions and avoiding rash investment decisions based on FOMO or greed.\n\nDiversify your portfolio: When investing in Bitcoin, diversification is essential for risk management. Don't put all of your eggs in one basket, and consider investing in assets other than Bitcoin.\n\nSet clear investment goals and a strategy to achieve them: Stick to your plan even when emotions are running high. This can assist you in avoiding rash investing decisions and sticking to a rational investment strategy.\n\nControl risk: Because bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, it is critical to manage risk when investing. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider setting stop-loss orders to limit your losses if prices start to fall.\n\nConsider the long term: Bitcoin's price can be highly volatile in the short term, but it has a long history of increasing in value. Taking a long-term perspective can help you avoid the fear, FOMO, and greed cycle and stay focused on your investment goals.\n\nFOMO Traders vs Disciplined Traders: What Are the Differences?\n\nThere are several differences between FOMO traders and disciplined traders. We highlight three of the most important ones:\n\nHow both traders do their research: a seasoned trader will do his or her research before committing to a trade while FOMO traders will blindly buy an asset simply due to seeing its price rise.\n\nTheir mental state: seasoned traders will have much more control over their emotions, meaning that before entering a trade, they will have a general idea of how it will turn out. Usually, the planning ahead involves setting up a stop-loss and an exit strategy for when to take profit. Consequently, they will have peace of mind whereas a FOMO trader will see his or her anxiety levels rise due to their lack of planning.\n\nHow they set both set expectations: a disciplined trader will know how to realistically and reasonably set his or her expectations. FOMO traders, on the other hand, simply believe the price will carry on rising and, more often than not, not even have a proper exit strategy lined up.\n\nThese differences are mainly connected to one\u2019s mental state when trading and trading psychology techniques. However, putting in the hard work, even as a FOMO trader will help overcome FOMO. This means having a trading plan, a trading routine, stop losses, a checklist, a trading journal, and so forth.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin investing is a highly emotional and volatile activity that can be influenced by a variety of psychological factors, such as fear, FOMO, and greed. When investing in Bitcoin, it is critical to manage your emotions and remain rational.\n\nYou can avoid the pitfalls of the fear, FOMO, and greed cycle and achieve your investment goals in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency by staying informed, diversifying your portfolio, making a plan and sticking to it, managing risk, and taking a long-term view."

        "title": "How to Transfer Bitcoin From an Exchange to a Hardware Wallet - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Do you want to take control of your BTC? With this easy-to-follow guide, you\u2019ll be able to securely store your cryptocurrency and have peace of mind knowing that you\u2019re the only one with access to your funds.\n\nMost casual cryptocurrency owners are content to keep their Bitcoin and other coins on the exchange where they bought them. Alternatively, they might transfer them to a software wallet, such as MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet, so they can easily buy NFTs, roll the dice on DeFi applications, or purchase products.\n\nBut those who take an extra-cautious approach to security often opt for hardware wallets: external devices that store crypto keys. Hardware wallets typically connect to a computer via USB or Bluetooth but don\u2019t go online, mitigating the risk of internet-based hacks. Since the wallet stays offline, it keeps your keys in \u201ccold storage.\u201d Because private keys never leave the device, hardware wallets are typically more secure than software wallets.\n\nIn addition to security, they provide a layer of control not present with funds held on an exchange. You decide when to send crypto and don\u2019t need to adhere to limits or waiting periods set by a third party.\n\nAlthough each hardware wallet will come with its own step-by-step setup instructions, we\u2019ve included the basics here as you consider your new investment.\n\nStep 1: Choose Your Hardware Wallet\n\nThere are several criteria you\u2019ll want to consider before buying a hardware wallet:\n\nCost : You can spend anywhere from $50 to $1,500 on a hardware wallet, depending on its features (see below) and reputation.\n\nPortability : If you need regular access to your crypto keys, you\u2019ll want a device that\u2019s lightweight and slim.\n\nSecurity : While any hardware wallet should be secure enough for average users, some have added features and stringent testing standards that put security maximalists at ease.\n\nSupported cryptocurrencies : You can send and receive Bitcoin with just about any hardware wallet. The same goes for most major cryptocurrencies \u2014 but not all of them. If there\u2019s a coin you must put in cold storage, ensure it\u2019s supported on the device.\n\nSupported operating systems : While you can use most hardware wallets with Linux, MacOS, and Windows, you\u2019ll want to double-check whether you can connect your hardware wallet to your mobile phone or tablet (e.g., Android or iOS).\n\nSupported platforms : Buying NFTs from OpenSea? You might want to get a Ledger, which easily connects to that marketplace. Enjoy ShapeShift? The KeepKey was built by the same people and integrates directly.\n\nUX : Beginners may want a device known for its ease of use before scaling up to options with advanced features.\n\nTwo major hardware wallet makers, Trezor and Ledger, have been duking it out since the mid-2010s. Each sells higher-end and lower-end models with their own advantages and disadvantages. Lesser-known brands, including KeepKey and SafePal, provide affordable alternatives.\n\nTrezor : Trezor\u2019s most expensive hardware wallet, the Model T, has a touchscreen for ease of use. What it doesn\u2019t have is Bluetooth connectivity or an iOS application.\n\nLedger : The Ledger Live software provides a comforting glimpse into your portfolio. However, you\u2019ll need it because the hardware relies on analog buttons rather than a touchscreen.\n\nKeepKey : This budget option supports fewer currencies than its peers. It sports a big screen, and its desktop software lets you connect to decentralized applications such as Uniswap.\n\nSafePal: SafePal offers mobile and browser-based apps to help manage the hardware, which is relatively inexpensive. While it\u2019s neither super-versatile nor built for beginners, it\u2019s designed to be more secure than its competitors.\n\nFor this article, we\u2019ll assume you\u2019ve bought a Ledger, but these steps should give you a general sense of the setup process:\n\nStep 2: Download Wallet Software\n\nAfter buying your hardware wallet, the typical first step is to download the software for that wallet from the company website. Doing so will enable you to interact with and use the hardware from your computer or mobile phone. The software allows you to see balances and portfolio information easily.\n\nStep 3: Safely Store Your Recovery Phrase\n\nHardware wallets provide some recourse even if you lose them. When you set up a hardware wallet, you will establish a seed phrase, a series of random words that can help you recover your account info if you lose the device. Write it down!\n\nYou can use the seed phrase to recover your private key and access funds if your hardware wallet gets stolen, lost, or damaged. The Ledger Nano S Plus includes three separate booklets, so you can store it in three different (secure) locations if you choose.\n\nTo reduce the chances of human error, we recommend confirming via the device that you\u2019ve written down your seed phrase correctly. It will take three extra minutes, but it could save heartache later.\n\nStep 4: Set Up Accounts on Your Hardware Wallet\n\nOnce your hardware wallet is up and running, you\u2019ll need to establish an account for each currency you will store on it. For Bitcoin, you\u2019ll set up a Bitcoin account, which provides an address for receiving funds. If you plan on storing ETH, you\u2019ll set up an Ethereum account. You can also receive ERC-20 tokens such as MKR and UNI at this address.\n\nThe software will prompt you to follow the instructions on the hardware.\n\nStep 5: Transfer From Your Exchange\n\nIf your funds are on an exchange such as Coinbase, log on to your account. From there, click the send/receive button and copy the address provided in the hardware wallet software.\n\nAfter waiting a few moments, you should see your funds show up on the hardware wallet\u2019s dashboard.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile hardware wallets provide an additional layer of security, they aren\u2019t for everyone. Unlike standard software wallets, they cost money. Moreover, they must be plugged into a computer or phone, so they aren\u2019t ideal for traders with a quick trigger finger; they\u2019re typically better for HODLers, though hardware wallet makers are adding trading features. Finally, they have to be set up, which may be more than green beginners are ready for.\n\nStill, you can buy a hardware wallet for less than a tank of gas. And the market supports enough models that greenhorns and advanced users alike should be able to find a product that suits them."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether prices slumped in Friday morning trading in Asia, along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies amid reports U.S.-based cryptocurrency bank Silvergate Capital Corp. could be the next corporate victim of the FTX crash. Polkadot led the losses. U.S. equities rose Thursday after a week of fluctuations on conflicting Federal Reserve comments about interest rates and data suggesting inflation is well entrenched in the economy.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin\u2019s price gains this year bring needed relief to cash-strapped crypto mining industry\n\nBitcoin fell 3.22% in the past 24 hours to US$22,827 as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, extending its weekly loss to 4.78%. Ether dropped 3.19% to US$1,602, for a seven-day fall of 3.33%.\n\nBoth tokens fell as much as 5% later in the Asia morning. Despite the slump, both are still up around 40% for the year to date.\n\nPolkadot led the losers among the top cryptocurrencies, sliding 6.00% to US$6.08, and losing 14.63% in the past seven days. The token has been in a downward trend for two weeks, though the Polkadot community remains active, leading the daily development on Github, according to Github tracker ProofofGithub on Thursday.\n\nSilvergate said Thursday in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the company is evaluating \u201cits ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d which sparked a more than 50% plunge in its stock price. A raft of crypto exchanges and platforms have cut ties with the bank.\n\nAs a Federal Reserve member bank, Silvergate positioned itself as a gate between traditional finance and crypto. The bank was hit hard by the FTX collapse and reported a US$1 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2022. It laid off 40% of its staff in January.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.02% in the past 24 hours to US$1.07 trillion. And the total trading volume over the last 24 hours went down 12.30% to US$42.65 billion.\n\nU.S. equities closed higher on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.05%, the S&P 500 moved up 0.76% and the Nasdaq Composite Index edged higher to 0.73%.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic indicated on Thursday that he supports an interest rate increase of 25 basis points in March, alleviating some recent concern the Fed may hike 50 points. This helped stocks move higher, but the market is caught in cross-currents as Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the same day that recent data suggests the inflation fight is far from over.\n\nData from the U.S. Department of Labour on Thursday showed initial jobless claims fell in the week ending Feb. 25, while labor costs rose, indicating inflation hasn\u2019t been tamed by the Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes so far.\n\nThe Fed set U.S. interest rates between 4.5% to 4.75% in February, the highest since October 2007. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 72.3% chance that the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points this month. They also predict a 27.7% chance for a raise of 50 basis points, a decrease from 29.9% on Thursday."

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\n\nCLEVELAND (WJW) \u2013 For scammers, cryptocurrency is now the best way get their money.\n\nAt a news conference Thursday morning, prosecutors in Cleveland said kiosks run by Bitcoin of America served as a middleman that made it easy for victims of scams to lose millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is money and if you\u2019re a money transmitter in Ohio, you need to have a license. Bitcoin of America does not have a license,\u201d Cuyahoga County Assistant Prosecutor Andrew Rogalski said.\n\nThree men were arrested, including Bitcoin of America CEO Sonny Meraban, of Miami, Florida, his father, Reza Mehraban and their attorney, William Soriano, who both live in the Chicago area.\n\nThey\u2019re facing dozens of counts of money laundering, conspiracy and numerous Ohio ATM licensing violations.\n\nMore than 50 Bitcoin of America ATMs were seized across Cuyahoga and Lorain counties.\n\nProsecutors say the machines were frequently, and in some cases exclusively, used as a middleman between scammers and their victims. All the while, prosecutors say Bitcoin of America took 20% off the top of every illegal transaction.\n\n\u201cBecause of Bitcoin of America\u2019s lack of safeguards, criminals around the world have used the company to receive payments and illicit funds to criminals in the U.S. and across the world. Scammers, robocallers and international organized crime groups have capitalized on the company\u2019s lack of compliance and licensing,\u201d Cleveland Secret Service Director Blaine Forshen said.\n\nThe Secret Service also says that the company\u2019s lack of licensing and compliance with the law allowed for funds taken from Northeast Ohio to go to criminal groups in Russia and to neo-Nazi groups.\n\nCounty prosecutors says at least eight victims have been identified here in Northeast Ohio, but they believe there are many more. They urge them to come forward.\n\n\u201cThey should do two things: file a police report with their local police department and two, go to the FTC website, as I mentioned with my comments, to file with their database and make a complaint that will get the ball rolling.\u201d Forshen said.\n\nProsecutors say the company may still have other unlicensed cryptocurrency ATMs in other Ohio counties.\n\nThey say that those machines should not be used because they\u2019re not legal in Ohio.\n\nThe Secret Service say Bitcoin of America has roughly 2,500 ATMs in 31 states."

(Nasdaq: CLSK), America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122, today released its unaudited bitcoin mining and operations update for the month ending February 28, 2023.\n\n\u201cOur background in energy efficiency gives us a clear advantage in the market as we make incremental improvements to our mining fleet,\u201d said Zach Bradford, CEO. \u201cFor example, this month we improved our efficiency by over three percent compared to December 2022, when we last reported these numbers in our quarterly report. That progress, coupled with average wholesale power rates as low as two cents per kilowatt hour, has allowed us to increase our profit margins even as production compressed month-over-month due to February being the shortest month of the year. Months like February are practice-runs for halving\u2014and we intend to continue to test and deploy all hardware and software at our disposal in our bid to be the best prepared miner when halving happens next year.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, construction continues in Washington, where an additional 50 megawatts are set to go online in a few months. We are relying on everything we have learned in this space, since constructing our very first mining campus in College Park, as we build the Washington expansion. Our ability to constantly iterate\u2014whether we are building air-cooled facilities or deploying latest-gen immersion cooling\u2014is built into the CleanSpark way. It\u2019s how we have managed to grow fast and reliably in the few short years since we entered this industry\u2014and how we\u2019ll continue to grow well into our future.\u201d\n\nFebruary Bitcoin Mining Update (unaudited)\n\nBitcoin mined in February: 576\n\nCY2023 bitcoin mined: 1,273\n\nTotal BTC holdings as of February 28: 100\n\nTotal BTC converted for operations and growth in February: 778\n\nCurrently deployed fleet of about 66,900 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a hashrate of 6.6 EH/s\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Company funded growth and operations through the sale of 778 bitcoins in February 2023 at an average of approximately $23K per BTC (compared to $19K in January 2023). Sales of BTC equated to proceeds of approximately $17.9 million. February daily BTC mined averaged about 20.6 and reached a high of 21.5.\n\nAbout CleanSpark\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK) is America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122.

        "title": "Bitcoin falls 5% overnight to $22,300\u2014after touching $25,000 last month\u2014as Silvergate troubles weigh on price - Fortune",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s wings were clipped overnight as it fell 5% and dropped to a 16-day low of $22,267.\n\nThe price on Friday morning recovered slightly, to about $22,300, while the second-most-popular cryptocurrency, Ether, had fallen about 3.5%, to $1,567, over 24 hours.\n\nThe lackluster day for the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency is a setback for investors who seemed increasingly hopeful that it would soon cross the $30,000 threshold, a feat not accomplished since May. Last month, Bitcoin briefly broke $25,000 after months below that level.\n\nPartly to blame for Bitcoin\u2019s nosedive on Friday are the negative results from crypto-focused bank Silvergate Capital. The firm reported a net loss of $1 billion on Tuesday, and on Thursday, the biggest U.S.-based exchange, Coinbase, said it would no longer accept or initiate payments to or from Silvergate. New York-based crypto company Paxos also distanced itself. Silvergate\u2019s stock has crashed more than 60% over the past five days.\n\nStill, Michael Safai, a managing partner at the crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital, said in a statement to Fortune that the market effects of the Silvergate news should be short lived.\n\n\u201cThis is news we knew about for the entirety of the U.S. trading day, but it wasn\u2019t until Asia came on that things started to plunge,\u201d Safai said in the statement. \u201cIt\u2019s more a case of jaded traders digesting the news and not wanting to be left holding any potential ticking time bombs, but not understanding how this differs from the collapses of 2022.\u201d\n\nUnlike the collapse of FTX, which led to its own steep decline in the price of Bitcoin, Silvergate is not a key source of liquidity for the crypto ecosystem.\n\n\u201cSilvergate\u2019s direct impact on market liquidity is very marginal at best, and any impact would be psychological rather than material,\u201d Safai added.\n\nYet, the psychological effects of Silvergate\u2019s fall from grace could still greatly affect the fragile crypto market. A series of collapses from crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital to FTX, along with the frostbite of Crypto Winter, have plagued the industry over the last year. Bitcoin, which makes up just under half of the total crypto market share, is down 47% year-over-year, while Ether is down about 40% over the same period.\n\nIf Bitcoin fails to defend the $22,000 mark, it could shatter hopes of a recovery in the coming months, Bitbank crypto analyst Yuya Hasegawa wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cThe next stop will likely be around $21.4k, where its February low and November high are converging,\u201d Hasegawa wrote."

        "title": "This project aims to revolutionize DeFi on Bitcoin - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the original cryptocurrency with the largest market cap, continues to lead the crypto market \u2014 to both the green and red. Even though the crypto space gave birth to quite a few projects, the rest of the herd is no match for the brainchild of Satoshi Nakamoto for financial transactions.\n\nThe unique unspent transaction output (UTXO) model used for the Bitcoin blockchain enables BTC to act much like a paper currency, resulting in superior security and robustness as a peer-to-peer currency. Especially compared to the bank-account-like model that Ethereum-based DeFi solutions typically adopt. As the pioneering cryptocurrency, Bitcoin presents massive liquidity, but Ethereum-based DeFi solutions have yet to develop a secure and effective way to tap into that.\n\nDeFi already met Bitcoin, but there was a catch\n\nWith the introduction of the Taproot upgrade, which enabled the implementation of smart contracts, DeFi found its route to the Bitcoin base layer for the first time. However, it started on the wrong foot: As the Taproot upgrade allowed people to bypass the initial 80-byte limit on the Bitcoin blockchain, people wasted no time in uploading all sorts of digital properties, including images, NFT-like inscribed assets and more, clogging up the base layer with unnecessary digital junk and possibly making Satoshi Nakamoto cringe.\n\nBitcoin needs its own layer-2 DeFi ecosystem that expands the use of BTC putting no additional pressure on the base layer, and that\u2019s where Mintlayer comes in. Mintlayer is an L2 solution rooted in the established network of the Bitcoin blockchain. Similar to how the Lightning Network solved Bitcoin payments at scale, Mintlayer is poised to bring decentralized finance to Bitcoin\u2019s toolkit, without compromising the Bitcoin community\u2019s principles.\n\nImproved security through atomic swaps\n\nAs the massively damaging DeFi hacks and exploits from last year proved, trying to use Bitcoin in a non-native blockchain via wrapped tokens or cross-chain bridges was a bad idea. After years of attacks and more than $2.5 billion in user funds lost, it is clear that the risk of becoming an attack surface is just too high for any token bridges to grow reliably.\n\nMintlayer, on the other hand, uses atomic swaps to allow a 1:1 transaction from native Bitcoin to tokens on the Mintlayer blockchain, effectively removing the need for any wrapped tokens or token bridges. This way, Bitcoin owners can use their BTC to give different DeFi use cases a go.\n\nEnrico Rubboli, co-creator of Mintlayer, explained why DeFi should be in the vizors of traditional financial institutions:\n\n\u201cDeFi is a trust-minimizing technology. When code replaces humans, it is incorruptible, taking human error out of the equation as much as possible. We are still early for that, both in terms of regulation and technology, but this is why Mintlayer exists.\u201d\n\nTo facilitate quick adoption, Mintlayer spent 2022 developing a mobile wallet and an extension for internet browsers as well as integrating with Lightning Network. Following the launch of its native token ML, Mintlayer aims to have its mainnet ready by the third quarter of 2023. Mintlayer\u2019s mission is to build a protocol with the least amount of friction for Bitcoin users to create the applications they need and use platforms built by others.\n\nThe team also announced the Mintlayer ecosystem fund to accelerate the growth of a DeFi ecosystem centered around Bitcoin. Projects bringing value to the Mintlayer ecosystem can also benefit from various grants the ecosystem fund provides. The fund helps projects and startups in different stages of development to find blockchain investors and like-minded stakeholders to push the space to new horizons.\n\nLearn more about Mintlayer"

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell 6.57% in the week from Feb. 24 to March 3, trading at US$22,362 at 8:30 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether slid 5.06% in the same period to change hands at US$1,565.\n\n2McLg0Jp hKdSIirH3XdnMD3PvjzNR S2H6vLL9XEOjAdH2Doet7RAqKFa7MS557i2UWnnzAl2QePUnWs1aF95Z59V4rDYUbCkH8 wtQJzRnkcxCR9 amDHr0CG 5ZzYKL8ruHjMa7fvol2wP Umve4\n\n\u201cBitcoin tested the US$22,300 mark this week, the important level I highlighted during my previous analysis. This level holds strong support for both static and dynamic,\u201d wrote Aziz Kenjaev, head of partnerships at decentralized crypto derivatives exchange GammaX, to Forkast.\n\n\u201cSee also the rebound of Bitcoin from US$22,030 backed by a dynamic support and a lower border of the parallel channel of Jan. 18,\u201d wrote Kenjaev, referring to the chart below.\n\n2HpKMPlk3pnAJ\n\n\u201cBuyers will try to keep BTC price above US$22,300 today and during weekends, however next week another giant red bar might fill in the Bitcoin chart,\u201d added Kenjaev.\n\nColin Johnson, chief executive officer and co-founder of Freeport, a platform bringing fine art investment on-chain, expects Bitcoin\u2019s crab walk to continue.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect a pumping BTC price in the near term \u2013 even with the upcoming Yuga Labs launch. As has been the trend, we can expect to see BTC continue its crab walk between US$22,000-24,000 until the uncertainty surrounding macro elements begins to clear,\u201d wrote Johnson.\n\n\u201cThe markets are likely to feel just like March weather \u2013 uninviting and finicky. We appear to be squarely in the doldrums with very little on the horizon indicating a long-term recovery of the stock market. Crypto will follow suit, unless a significant change in the perception of crypto assets as hedges against inflation begins to take hold amongst large players, which remains a possibility,\u201d added Johnson.\n\nJonas Betz, a Germany-based crypto analyst, told Forkast that Mt. Gox exchange\u2019s upcoming bankruptcy repayments decision could contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s crab walk.\n\n\u201cDue to fears of a Bitcoin dump because of the Mt. Gox bankruptcy redemptions as well as a tense macroeconomic situation, I expect Bitcoin to continue its sideways trend in the coming week. Though pessimism among market participants is increasing, a break below US$20,000 is unlikely, as Bitcoin has shown only little reaction to bad news in recent weeks. I expect the bitcoin price to continue its sideways trend in the range between US$21,000-25,000,\u201d wrote Betz.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at US$1.03 trillion on Friday at 8:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, falling 5.5% from US$1.09 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$431 billion market cap represented 42.1% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$191 billion accounted for 18.7%.\n\nOver 69% of Bitcoin supply was in profit on March 2, according to on-chain data provider CryptoQuant, up from 49% on Jan. 1. The higher this percentage, the more Bitcoin holders are in profit, increasing the probability of investors selling to take profit.\n\n4aGVzoM2PeWyrx0CZV4bkykgE hPns8vvPfobsSmNNtNhd82cLwMHb4M941 b2Oo9daXIzTWV\n\nInvestment management giant Morgan Stanley warned on Tuesday that the current stock market rally is a \u201cbull trap,\u201d and that \u201cMarch is a high-risk month for the bear market to resume.\u201d\n\nEvgeny Goncharov, director and blockchain advisor at crypto consulting firm BDC Consulting, said that an incoming bull trap might be possible.\n\n\u201cThe bull trap is real. Chinese money supply (US$1.7 million) in the last year influenced investing activities at the beginning of this year. It\u2019s a new narrative impacting the crypto market too. But Chinese investors copy the behavior of western investors. That\u2019s why we consider this factor reinforcement of the traditional markets\u2019 trends and could be switched to different sides,\u201d wrote Goncharov.\n\nBiggest gainers: MKR & SSV\n\nMakerDAO\u2019s governance token was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. The Mkr token rose 25.82% on the weekly chart, to trade at US$930.16 at 8:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. Maker is the largest crypto lending protocol in the decentralized finance space.\n\nThe token started picking up on March 1, following MakerDAO\u2019s proposal to enable the use of its governance token as collateral for borrowing the DAI stablecoin.\n\nSSV.Network\u2019s Ssv token was the second biggest gainer, rising 14.72% to change hands at US$44.37. SSV.Network is a project that builds distributed validator infrastructure and decentralized Ether staking products, which gained significant attention at the ETHDenver Hackathon.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin Punks exceed 1,145 ETH in daily trading volume as Bitcoin Ordinals gain traction\n\nNext week?\n\n\u201cBeware the ides of March. Bitcoin is likely to end the month around or possibly just below US$21,000. Below US$20,000 means a possible re-testing of the US$16,000-17,000 floor. Above US$25,000 is possible only on breakout macroeconomic news, or a significant sentiment shift against the US Dollar because of runaway inflation,\u201d wrote Freeport\u2019s Johnson.\n\n\u201cConfidence reports on inflation, interest rates, the war in Ukraine, China, and possibly the outcome of the student debt relief decision in the Supreme court,\u201d will be the main factors driving markets, according to Johnson. \u201cRelief could drive the perception that young Americans will push their newly found \u2018cash\u2019 into the crypto ecosystem,\u201d he added.\n\nGammaX\u2019s Kenjaev warned of more potential volatility next week, due to the upcoming testimony of U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s price is also driven by the gains and losses of its major trading counterpart \u2013 the U.S. Dollar\u2026 We are expecting high volatility during the testament of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Tuesday and Wednesday. And for the rest of the week we are expecting a slight roller coaster since the important data on job openings, NFP (nonfarm payroll report) and unemployment will be released,\u201d wrote Kenjaev, adding that any developments regarding Paxos and Kraken will be significant.\n\n\u201cI am expecting a retest of US$22,800-22,900 by Monday and another drop to US$21,450 next week. The key level to watch is US$22,300. If there is a daily close below this level, then US$21,450 is the next important support to watch. Although I still stand for a drop to US$19,000, this level to me would be a significant booster level for the next major uptrend,\u201d wrote Kenjaev.\n\nAlex Reinhardt, the founder of PLC Ultima, a firm building crypto infrastructure for mass adoption, said that the crypto market is mainly driven by the U.S. economy and growing consumer prices.\n\n\u201cSo far, data on the state of the American economy and the growth of consumer prices in the U. S. have a more significant impact on the crypto market and the price of Bitcoin. The PCE index published last week turned out to be worse than expected, and this negative effect immediately affected the crypto market. The risks that the Fed will decide to raise the key rate by 50 basis points instead of 25, as previously expected, have grown after the publication of the household consumption index,\u201d wrote Reinhardt, adding that \u201cBitcoin Ordinals definitely cannot compare with the expected effect of the FOMC press conference scheduled for March 22.\u201d\n\nBetz the analyst expects more bearish momentum in March. \u201cI can see Bitcoin ending March at US$22,000. The reason for my bearish price target is that inflation has picked up and it is likely that the Fed funds rate will be increased after the FOMC meeting on March 21-22. An important price level to watch is the psychological levels of US$20,000 and US$25,000. A breach of either of these levels will lead to a major price move,\u201d wrote Betz.\n\nSee related article: Industry reacts: US cracks down on crypto, India calls for regulatory collaboration"

        "content": "Crypto traders' urge to create leverage positions with Bitcoin (BTC) appears irresistible to many people, but it's impossible to know if these traders are extreme risk-takers or savvy market-makers hedging their positions. The need to maintain hedges holds even if traders rely on leverage merely to reduce their counterparty exposure by maintaining a collateral deposit and the bulk of their position on cold wallets.\n\nNot all leverage is reckless\n\nRegardless of the reason for traders' use of leverage, currently there is a highly unusual imbalance in margin lending markets that favors BTC longs betting on a price increase. Despite this, so far, the movement has been restricted on margin markets because the BTC futures markets remained relatively calm throughout 2023.\n\nMargin markets operate differently from futures contracts in two main areas. Those are not derivatives contracts, meaning the trade happens on the same order book as regular spot trading and, unlike futures contracts, the balance between margin longs and shorts is not always matched.\n\nFor instance, after buying 20 Bitcoin using margin, one can literally withdraw the coins from the exchange. Of course, there must be some form of collateral, or a margin deposit, for the trade, and this is usually based on stablecoins. If the borrower fails to return the position, the exchange will automatically liquidate the margin to repay the lender.\n\nThe borrower must also pay an interest rate for the BTC bought with margin. The operational procedures will vary between marketplaces held by centralized and decentralized exchanges, but usually the lender gets to decide the rate and duration of the offers.\n\nMargin traders can either long or short\n\nMargin trading allows investors to leverage their positions by borrowing stablecoins and using the proceeds to buy more cryptocurrency. When these traders borrow Bitcoin, they use the coins as collateral for short positions, which means they are betting on a price decrease.\n\nThat is why analysts monitor the total lending amounts of Bitcoin and stablecoins to understand whether investors are leaning bullish or bearish. Interestingly, Bitfinex margin traders entered their highest leverage long/short ratio on Feb. 26.\n\nBitfinex margin Bitcoin longs/shorts ratio. Source: TradingView\n\nHistorically, Bitfinex margin traders are known for creating margin positions of 10,000 BTC or higher quickly, indicating the participation of whales and large arbitrage desks.\n\nAs the above chart indicates, on Feb. 26, the BTC/USD long (bulls) margin demand outpaced shorts (bears) by 133 times, at 105,300 BTC. Before 2023, the last time this indicator reached an all-time high favoring longs was Sept. 12, 2022. Unfortunately, for bulls, the result benefited bears as Bitcoin nosedived 19% over the following six days.\n\nTraders should cross-reference the data with other exchanges to ensure the anomaly is market-wide, especially since each marketplace holds different risks, norms, liquidity and availability.\n\nOKX, for instance, provides a margin lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. At OKX, traders can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of a cryptocurrency's price.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders' margin lending ratio increased through February, signaling that professional traders added leveraged long positions even as Bitcoin price failed to break the $25,000 resistance multiple times between Feb. 16 and Feb. 23.\n\nFurthermore, the margin ratio at OKX on Feb. 22 was the highest level seen in over six months. This level is highly unusual and matches the trend seen at Bitfinex where a strong imbalance favored Bitcoin margin longs.\n\nRelated: Can Bitcoin reach $25K again in March 2023? Watch Market Talks live\n\nThe difference in the cost of leverage could explain the imbalance\n\nThe rate for leverage BTC longs at Bitfinex has been almost nonexistent throughout 2023, currently sitting below 0.1% per year. In short, traders should not panic, considering the cost of margin lending remains in a zone that is deemed healthy, and the imbalance is not present in futures contracts markets.\n\nThere may be a plausible explanation for the movement, which did not happen overnight. For instance, a possible culprit is the rising cost of stablecoin lending.\n\nInstead of the minimal rate offered for Bitcoin loans, stablecoin borrowers pay 25% per year on Bitfinex. That cost increased significantly in November 2022 when the leading derivatives exchange FTX and their market-maker, Alameda Research, blew up.\n\nAs long as Bitcoin margin markets remain extremely unbalanced, traders should continue monitoring the data for additional signs of stress. Currently, no red flags are raised, but the size of the Bitfinex BTC/USD longs ($2.5 billion position) should be a reason for concern.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Xapo Bank, an international private bank headquartered in Gibraltar, has integrated the Lightning Network to improve its Bitcoin (BTC) capabilities.\n\nOn March 2, Xapo officially announced a partnership with the Lightning Network infrastructure platform Lightspark, which allowed the firm to implement Lightning on its platform.\n\nThe integration enables faster and cheaper transactions on Xapo, reducing blockchain confirmation waiting times and transaction fees on the original Bitcoin network.\n\nAccording to the firm, Xapo Bank members will now be able to instantly pay for small purchases of up to $100 at any vendor accepting Lightning payments. High-volume transactions will not initially be supported with the integration.\n\nThe new integration was introduced on Feb. 27 as part of a new update for Xapo bank\u2019s apps on the App Store and the Google Play Store.\n\nLightning Network transactions on Xapo via Lightspark\n\nAccording to Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca, Bitcoin\u2019s transaction confirmation can take up to one hour during periods of high usage, which makes BTC unsuitable for small daily payments like groceries. By integrating the Lightning Network, Xapo allows its customers to pay with Bitcoin without having to convert it to the U.S. dollar, he said.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin node connection shuts down: BlueWallet users urged to withdraw funds\n\nBitcoin average confirmation time has seen a huge spike in mid-February amid a massive activity on the Bitcoin network, with the mempool size reaching November 2022 levels. According to data from YCharts, BTC confirmation time hit nearly 600 minutes on Feb. 19.\n\nSource: Ycharts\n\nRocca also noted that Bitcoin payments are especially crucial during times of hyperinflation, economic uncertainty and political turmoil.\n\nFounded in 2013, Xapo operates a private bank as well as a Bitcoin custodian and wallet regulated by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission. The company is known for combining traditional banking with crypto by offering USD and BTC accounts in one place.\n\nXapo claims that, at the peak of its Bitcoin custodianship, the firm held more than 800,000 BTC ($18.7 billion) for family offices, funds and high net-worth individuals. Such an amount of Bitcoin is more than 4% of the entire number of all BTC in circulation."

        "content": "What happened\n\nMany cryptocurrencies continued to slide today as investors digest the fallout from the crypto bank Silvergate Capital (SI) and evaluate its ability to stay in business.\n\nThe price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC 1.55%), is trading 4.3% lower than late yesterday afternoon as of 10 a.m. ET today. The price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH -1.35%), is roughly 4.1% lower, while the price of the meme token Shiba Inu (SHIB -1.01%) is down 5.8%.\n\nSo what\n\nAfter the market closed Wednesday, Silvergate submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stating that it would need to delay the filing of its annual report as it analyzed the impact of several events on its business.\n\nSilvergate operates a real-time payments network for U.S. dollars that crypto exchanges and institutional traders use to better facilitate crypto transactions. The network is very helpful for the crypto ecosystem because cryptocurrencies trade around the clock and the U.S. banking system operates on a lag.\n\nBut the scandal-laden bankruptcy of FTX, which had been a large client of Silvergate, prompted a bank run, and Silvergate saw nearly 70% of its digital-asset-related deposits leave the bank in the fourth quarter of 2022. The bank had to sell a big chunk of its bond portfolio, while it traded at a loss, to cover the deposit outflows, wiping out a big chunk of shareholder equity. Furthermore, many investors believed Silvergate could face some severe regulatory action due to its relationship with FTX, and media outlets have reported that the U.S. Department of Justice is looking into the bank.\n\nIn its filing with the SEC, Silvergate said it continued to sell bonds at a loss in January and February and that its capital levels could now be below regulatory requirements as a result. Furthermore, Silvergate is also currently assessing the impact of regulatory inquiries and investigations into the bank. All of this has led the bank to assess its \"ability to continue as a going concern.\"\n\nYesterday, some of Silvergate's major clients, such as Coinbase (COIN -1.72%), announced they would stop using the bank, and Silvergate's stock fell a whopping 58% and is down nearly an additional 11% today, trading around $5 per share. Although most cryptocurrencies fell yesterday, they held up decently given the news. Today, however, investors seem more worried.\n\n\"The bearish turn could certainly be a delayed reaction to Silvergate's ongoing issues,\" said Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko, according to CNBC. \"Many large exchanges and market makers partner with Silvergate for fast transactions between entities, and any halt in activity could have an impact on global crypto liquidity.\"\n\n\"In addition, there are now wider industry concerns that U.S. regulators are trying to cut off further banking relationships between crypto firms and FDIC-insured banks,\" Markus Thielen, the head of research at digital asset platform Matrixport, told Cointelegraph.\n\nNow what\n\nFederal banking regulators have issued multiple statements warning banks about the risks associated with certain crypto activities, and another large crypto bank, Signature Bank (SBNY), has also scaled back its crypto activities.\n\nThe news is of industrywide interest because services provided by Silvergate help exchanges, traders, and others easily change dollars to crypto and vice versa.\n\nI still think the largest cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, will be here for a long time and that people will continue to be able to swap them for fiat currencies. However, I have no interest in meme tokens like Shiba Inu right now."

But the EV company's move opened a door for Adidas' plans to use blockchain, said the sportswear company's Web3 lead Erika Wykes-Sneyd.\n\n\"Elon Musk helped to open that door for us, just a little bit, so we could capture people's imaginations internally,\" Wykes-Sneyd told Decrypt at the NFT Paris conference. \"We did use it as a slipstream,\" she added\u2014one that enabled Web3 advocates at the company to \"start the conversation\" around what Adidas could do with blockchain technology.\n\nOne thing Adidas was keen to avoid was simply offering crypto payment options for its products. \"I think those of us that knew were like, 'Well, I don't think just accepting crypto is what it means to get in this space,'\" said Wykes-Sneyd.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInstead, the sportswear giant embarked on an ambitious program of Web3 initiatives that included buying its own Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, teaming up with NFT collector gmoney on a multimillion-dollar NFT drop and partnering with crypto exchange Coinbase and metaverse platform The Sandbox. The company even showcased its Bored Ape avatar, Indigo Herz, in its World Cup trailer.\n\nBuilding Adidas' Web3 strategy\n\nFrom day one, said Wykes-Sneyd, the aim was to \"make sure we're supercharging and using Web3 to fast track what Adidas is saying its corporate goals are.\" That involved a lot of planning; her team spent nine months engaging in \"laying down the strategy, building the foundations, a lot of relationship building\" before putting its Web3 plans into action. \"By the time we went to market, everybody for the most part thought, 'Wow, Adidas is early,'\" she said. \"And we were, but we were actually thinking about this and planning it for 10 months prior.\"\n\nThe company's future plans include token-gated sneaker drops and\u2014potentially\u2014payments in Apecoin, the Bored Ape Yacht Club-themed token.\n\nAs for Tesla, the EV company abandoned its plans to use Bitcoin as a payment method mere months after Elon Musk's much-trumpeted announcement, citing the cryptocurrency's environmental impact.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdidas, for its part, is more committed to cryptocurrency and Web3. \"We've fully indoctrinated everybody at this point,\" said Wykes-Sneyd. \"That's been part of the journey for the last year and a half, is getting people across a huge global organization to be drinking the Kool-Aid.\""

Even when the company was told, certain transactions involved people being scammed out of thousands of dollars, they never gave back the 20% fee they collected to victims, totaling more than $3.5 million.\n\n\"Obviously this was a very complex operation,\" said Michael C. O'Malley, the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor. \"All of these warrants were executed yesterday. There were over 100 law enforcement officers involved and it was a very complex operation.\"\n\nAs a part of the announcement, prosecutors confirmed that the U.S. Secret Service and Lisle police executed a search warrant at the company's office in Lisle on Wednesday morning with help from the DuPage County State's Attorney's Office. This was the same police activity that Lisle police warned about, but provided few details on.\n\nIn addition, Cuyahoga County prosecutors said Reza Meraban was arrested during another search warrant execution at his residence in Naperville. Suriano was also arrested in Riverside, Illinois.\n\nSonny Meraban, the owner and founder of S and P Solutions, was arrested at his residence in Miami, Florida.\n\nProsecutors said the individuals charged were operating the kiosks without a money transmission license and that they falsely represented their money transferring capabilities to Ohio regulators to avoid detection.\n\nBitcoin of America has 2,500 ATMs across 31 states. CBS 2 found several machines in River North. One inside a corner market had a warning sign on it saying \"If the person depositing money was instructed to make a payment to the IRS or Social Security Administration, they are most likely the victim of a scam.\"\n\n\"Machines were also used to scam elderly people in northeast Ohio, including eight victims who were led to these machines through fraudulent means to transfer funds,\" O'Malley said.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service Cyber Fraud and Money Laundering Task Force conducted the investigation with help from several other law enforcement agencies including four from the Chicago area.\n\nThe investigation remains ongoing.\n\nCBS 2 has been told there are no victims in Chicago. The scams were able to take place because Bitcoin of America had not consumer protections or anti-money laundering practices in place. Prosecutors said now that the case is public, they believe more victims will be coming forward."

Some took a tougher stance following the collapse of mega digital asset exchange FTX back in November.\n\nAccording to most U.K. high-street banks with limits, the crackdown is to protect investors from cryptocurrency fraud. \u201cWe want to do everything we can to protect our customers and we feel that limiting payments to cryptocurrency exchanges is the best way to make sure your money stays safe,\u201d Santander says.\n\nSo what are the current rules?

Now, customers cannot buy any digital assets from exchanges using credit cards. Those who bank with HSBC can buy crypto with a debit card through certain U.K.-regulated platforms\u2014but not exchanges like Coinbase.\n\nThe banking giant has said it has no interest in Bitcoin and has banned customers from buying stocks of companies with Bitcoin exposure.\n\nStory continues\n\nLloyds\n\nLloyds allows its clients to buy crypto via U.K.-regulated platforms and make withdrawals from exchanges such as Coinbase\u2014but only using debit cards.\n\nIt was one of the first banks in the U.K. to stop its clients from buying crypto with credit cards back in 2018.\n\nNatWest\n\nNatWest Group CEO Alison Rose last month said that the bank had \u201ctaken a pretty hard line as a bank on crypto.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2021, the bank barred corporate customers who deal in cryptocurrencies. That means companies like crypto exchanges with a base in the U.K. cannot hold accounts at NatWest.\n\nThe FCA Has 5 Entirely Reasonable Concerns About Cryptocurrency\n\nBut right now, according to the bank, that \u201cdoesn't mean that we block cryptocurrency payments altogether but we will restrict payments to cryptocurrency exchanges that present the highest risk of financial harm.\u201d\n\nYou can use a NatWest account to buy digital assets from exchanges such as Coinbase. Amounts are limited, according to the bank, though NatWest has not revealed exactly by how much.\n\nBarclays\n\nBarclays bank does not allow customers to buy or sell crypto through its online banking platform. Would-be investors can buy crypto via a regulated, FCA-approved broker, though.\n\nBarclays was one of the U.K. banks that stopped customers making payments to crypto exchange Binance in 2021 after the British regulatory body FCA issued a warning over exchange.\n\nSantander\n\nHigh-street bank Santander announced last year that it would be limiting U.K. customers from making large crypto transactions. As it stands, those who bank with Santander can make single transactions of \u00a31,000, with a total limit of \u00a33,000 in any rolling 30-day period.\n\nA crypto trader who banks with Santander told Decrypt that his account was closed without warning after making withdrawals from Coinbase.\n\nWise\n\nFormerly known as TransferWise, Wise does not deal in cryptocurrencies at all. And you can\u2019t use an account to buy digital assets from an exchange. But Wise customers can receive money to their account from a platform that deals with crypto if it is regulated in the EU or UK.\n\nMonzo\n\nYou can buy cryptocurrency on big, established exchanges such as Coinbase (but not Binance) with popular challenger bank Monzo, but it \u201cmay block a small number of transactions based on risk.\u201d The bank does not say how big or small these transactions are.\n\nStarling\n\nChallenger bank Starling is one of the strictest: it has banned customers from all crypto-related payments. \u201cWe consider crypto activity to be high risk,\u201d the bank said in November. Starling clients told Decrypt that the move was sudden.\n\nHi there \ud83d\udc4b We always review our position in relation to financial crime. We consider crypto activity to be high risk. We\u2019ve taken the decision to prevent all card payments to crypto merchants and to implement further restrictions on outgoing and incoming transfers. \u2014 Starling Bank (@StarlingBank) November 22, 2022\n\nRevolut\n\nThis challenger bank is the most crypto-friendly of them all: users can buy, sell, and store a number of digital assets via the mobile banking app. And just last month, the bank launched a staking service for Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, and Tezos."

        "title": "What these Bitcoin [BTC] metrics reveal about its current position - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s performance in February reveals that investors are optimistic about long-term prospects.\n\nBitcoin is off to a bullish start, but exchange inflows suggest that some more sell pressure may curtail the short-term rally.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] just wound up the shortest month of the year above its end of January, close despite more uncertainty in February. Now the big question for most trading is whether it will sustain the bullish bias or keep give in to the bears.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nBitcoin\u2019s performance in February may offer some insights into the cryptocurrency market\u2019s current condition and March expectations. BTC\u2019s supply in profit was down to 67% by the end of February, after peaking at 72.2% during the same month.\n\nThis decline confirms that there was ample accumulation near recent highs with the expectation that prices will remain. It also confirms that most of the current holders bought in January.\n\nIn contrast, the current level of Bitcoin supply in profit is still above the lowest level in the last four weeks. The supply in profit bottomed out at 63.99% during the month. This means there is still some room for more downside before it reaches the perceived bottom range below 45%. The glass half full view suggests that there is a lot of room for more upside before it the peak of the bull cycle.\n\nAs far as the value of the Bitcoin issued on a daily basis is concerned, the Puell multiple dropped to its lowest monthly level on 25 February. Its value at the lowest point was 0.67, hence indicating relative strength among the BTC holders.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s peak Puell multiple figure was 1.19 in mid-February. This means it was well below the level considered as euphoria, but the lower range was also not in the capitulation range. These findings further add to the evidence suggesting that investors maintained an optimistic sentiment in February.\n\nCan Bitcoin sustain the optimism?\n\nSo far, the market has maintained some degree of optimism, as was the case with most investors holding for long-term gains. However, the FOMC\u2019s next meeting, which will take place later this month, might determine the next major outcome. Press time sentiments expect FED to raise rates slightly. Such a move may trigger some market FUD and send Bitcoin potentially below $20,000 once again.\n\nThe economic dice is yet to roll; hence, the expected FED interest rate hike is not guaranteed to take place. Bitcoin kicked off March with a bit of a rally as it attempts to bounce off the RSI mid-range.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nBitcoin achieved a 2.63% rally in the last 24 hours, but the MFI indicates that it is experiencing outflows. A look at the Bitcoin exchange flows confirmed that exchange inflows were higher than exchange outflows at the time of writing.\n\nThese higher exchange outflows may give way for the bears in the short-run unless a demand shift occurs."

        "content": "Xapo is partnering with Lightspark to allow its customers to send bitcoin near-instantaneously to any vendor who accepts BTC over Lightning.\n\nGibraltar-licensed private bank Xapo Bank has partnered with Lightspark, the startup spearheaded by former Facebook crypto lead David Marcus, to integrate the Lightning Network and enable near-instant bitcoin payments for its customers.\n\nXapo Bank members can now make small purchases of up to $100 USD at any vendor that accepts Lightning payments, without high transaction fees and long blockchain confirmation waiting times. This integration will make Xapo Bank the first fully licensed private bank to offer Lightning payments.\n\nThe Lightning Network enables scalable payments at millions of transactions per second across the network, reducing the time-consuming and costly experiences often faced by users who pay for small transactions in bitcoin.\n\nSeamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank, said in regards to the partnership, \"By integrating with the hyper-efficient Lightning Network, we are the first bank in the world to streamline this process and allow our members to pay for small purchases with Bitcoin without having to convert to USD first.\" Rocca added that Xapo Bank offers an annual interest rate of 4.1% on US dollars and will soon be offering up to 1% on Bitcoin, to be paid out daily.\n\n\n\n\"We're thrilled to enable the first bank on the Lightning Network to offer instant, cheap Bitcoin payments to its customers,\u201d said David Marcus, co-founder and CEO of Lightspark. \u201cXapo has been one of our early closed beta partners, and we're delighted they chose Lightspark's enterprise-grade solution to reliably send and receive payments on the Lightning Network without all the complexity and operational overhead that typically comes with running a node on it.\"\n\nXapo Bank members can pay via the Lightning Network by holding bitcoin in the Xapo Bank App and scanning and paying an invoice at any merchant that accepts Lightning payments.\n\n\n\nThe network charges a small fee for each transaction, and Xapo Bank has set a fixed payment fee for 15 sats to protect members from executing transactions with high fees.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Block, the payments firm known for Cash App and its lightweight merchant terminals, has long held Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Now, the company is taking its support for Bitcoin a step further by deploying part of its crypto holdings to support the Lightning network, a so-called layer-2 system that makes Bitcoin payments faster and cheaper.\n\nOn Thursday, Block announced a new business line it\u2019s calling \u201cc=\u201d that will entail the company taking a portion of the over 10,000 Bitcoins it holds in its corporate treasury and storing them on the Lightning network. In doing so, Block will serve as a liquidity provider on the fledgling network, which is constructed of a series of peer-to-peer channels where transactions are conducted apart from the primary Bitcoin blockchain, and then later recorded on the main chain.\n\nI spoke with Nick Slaney, an executive who leads a Lightning-focused unit of the company called TBD, about what impact the new liquidity service will have on Block\u2019s overall business. He said that Block, for now, is deploying only a small part of its overall Bitcoin holdings to the project, but predicted the new service would in time grow into a significant revenue stream for the company. Slaney explained that Block will earn some Satoshis\u2014the smallest unit of a Bitcoin, worth a fraction of a penny\u2014each time someone uses Block for help routing a transaction on Lightning.\n\nSlaney added that Block\u2019s new service will be especially helpful to merchants who accept payments via the Lightning network by helping them cash out quickly. He also noted that, while the Lightning network is still relatively small, it\u2019s growing fast and has gotten a boost from a new social network called Nostr that incorporates Bitcoin payments.\n\nAll of this is an interesting development for Block, whose cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey\u2014also the longtime CEO of Twitter prior to Elon Musk\u2014has long been a Bitcoin booster. But it reflects as well how Bitcoin, whose culture has long been defined by curmudgeonly hoarders (a.k.a. hodlers), has become a lot more innovative in recent years with the help of the Lightning network. This has been refreshing to see, especially as Bitcoin remains by far the most valuable blockchain in all of crypto.\n\nSpeaking of innovation, I will be spending the next two days at ETHDenver, an annual extravaganza where Ethereum devotees unveil new products and engage in colorful antics that often involve dressing up as unicorns and other outlandish creatures. The event can feel at times like the crypto equivalent of Woodstock, but beneath the extravagant displays there is always an exciting current of collective inspiration.

        "title": "Bitcoin Miner Capitulation Has Been 'Completely Different' This Cycle: CoinShares - Decrypt",
        "content": "In brief Compared to previous bear markets, Bitcoin miners are faring much differently this time around.\n\nChapter 11 bankruptcies are completely different than abrupt shutdowns like those in China.\n\nAs for green shoots, one analyst is pointing to next year's halving event.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA cycle of miner capitulation can be observed throughout Bitcoin\u2019s history.\n\nWhen times are good, miners stockpile their Bitcoin, restricting the supply of new coins during high demand and serving as an additional multiplier to the general upward price trend.\n\nWhen times are bad, like the past few months, miners sell their Bitcoin treasuries\u2014usually to cover operating expenses when mining is less profitable, like when Bitcoin\u2019s price is low, or to pay off over-leveraged positions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack in June 2022, for example, a report by crypto analysts at Arcane Research revealed that during the month of May, publicly-traded Bitcoin miners like Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain sold more Bitcoin than they mined\u2014a stark reversal of fortunes from the first four months of the year when the same miners sold less than a third of their earnings.\n\nThis cycle\u2019s been different, though, CoinShares Bitcoin research lead Christopher Bendiksen told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cWhen you had a much less efficient capital market it was probably a lot less orderly and we saw that manifested previously as these big pullbacks in difficulty,\u201d he said, comparing the current network to when the industry was less established. \u201cThat just hasn\u2019t happened this time, even though we\u2019ve had spectacular bankruptcies and a bunch of operations struggling.\u201d\n\nDuring capitulation cycles, miners running inefficient or overleveraged operations drop off the network\u2014usually, this has meant that they switch off their machines.\n\nThis can lead to those \u201cbig pullbacks\" that Bendikson mentioned, when it briefly becomes easier for mining hardware to mine Bitcoin, before a rebalancing period during which more mining hardware gets deployed, lifting mining difficulty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis time, though, except for a brief period due to poor weather in the United States, firms haven\u2019t been shutting off their machines.\n\nThis had made the latest capitulation cycle unique, shedding more light on how the mining market is quickly evolving.\n\nChapter 11 makes markets different\n\nThe recent bankruptcies haven\u2019t had a significant effect on mining difficulty because, this time round, the majority of miners on the network were based in the U.S., said Bendiksen.\n\nBefore China\u2019s 2021 crackdown on crypto, the bulk of the network\u2019s hash rate (computing power) was located outside the U.S., predominantly in mid-sized, at least by today\u2019s standards, private mining farms in China.\n\nThese farms dropped off the network when authorities cut their power, leading to a sudden 17% drop in the network\u2019s hash rate.\n\nThis crackdown was far more unorderly for miners, with physical locations abruptly closing down, taking down a host of mining equipment with them.\n\nThat\u2019s just not been the case for the more well-ordered bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n\u201cEither the shutdowns that have happened have been outgrown by new hash rate, more contracted machines coming on, or the machines haven\u2019t been shut off,\u201d the CoinShares researcher told Decrypt. \u201cIt looks completely different from other cycles.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConsider, for instance, Core Scientific. In December, the firm officially filed for bankruptcy, citing the ongoing market conditions.\n\nCritically, though, the miner said that its operations would continue. The firm also penned several financing agreements to do that, further highlighting the differences between swift regulatory action and the slow-moving bankruptcy process.\n\nAll eyes on Bitcoin\u2019s halving\n\nBitcoin prices are still 66% lower than their record set back in 2021 and there may very well be more financial difficulties down the road. According to Bendikson, the market may need to wait until next year for more green shoots.\n\nIn a research note, Bendiksen pointed to the 2024 halving event, which he said has historically been tied to bull markets. The Bitcoin halving is when the network cuts the amount of rewards that miners receive for their work in half.\n\n\u201cHistorically, there has been a recurring tendency for the halvings to be closely followed by bull markets, leading to the now famed four-year bull/bear cycles in bitcoin price,\u201d he wrote in a research note.\n\nData from Coinwarz puts that event at roughly April 26, 2024.\n\nRegardless of price, if the industry has learned anything from this latest spiral, it\u2019s that the mining industry has matured by leaps and bounds in the last few years."

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nInterest in bridging bitcoin (BTC) to the Avalanche smart contract blockchain (BTC.b) continues to swell as the supply of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), the largest wrapped version of bitcoin on Ethereum, dwindles.\n\nOn Thursday, over 2,000 BTC ($44 million) was ported to Avalanche, the largest single-day BTC.b mint on record, according to data sourced from pseudonymous analyst 0xAcid's dashboard on Dune Analytics. That has lifted the total circulating supply of BTC.b to 8,572.\n\nAccording to 0xAcid, half of the bitcoin minted on Thursday has been moved to BENQI Finance. BENQI Finance is an Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, which allows users to lend, borrow and earn additional yields from digital assets.\n\nIn June 2022, Avalanche added support for bitcoin on its cross-chain bridge, allowing BTC holders to deploy their coins in the Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem to generate extra yield. BTC.b has seen impressive growth since then, surpassing the number of coins held in the Lightning Network.\n\nA crypto bridge is a tool that facilitates interactions between the two economically and technologically separate blockchains. Bridges became a target of hackers last year, accounting for about 70% of the total exploits in the crypto industry last year, according to forensics firm Chainalysis.\n\nBTC.b on Avalanche bridge (Dune Analytics)\n\nThe record BTC.b mint comes as the WBTC supply fell by 15% to 153,164 in February, reaching the lowest since March 2021. Apparently, bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network, a well-known WBTC holder, redeemed a large amount of WBTC, causing a sharp drop in the token's supply.\n\nWBTC, issued by Bitgo, is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum network with its price pegged 1:1 with bitcoin. The token's supply peaked at 285,000 in April last year and has been falling ever since.\n\nThe Avalanche community considers BTC.b a better option than WBTC, considering Avalanche offers users the ability to mint and redeem BTC.b anytime with the bridge in a non-custodial browser extension Core, eliminating the need for intermediaries. It provides more control to users, unlike WBTC, which relies on merchants to initiate the process of minting and burning.\n\nStory continues\n\n7/ Adoption in this case has been spurred due to a superior product offering.$BTC.b offers users:\n\n\n\n-Seamless transfers between Bitcoin and @avalancheavax\n\n- Cost effective yield on BTC reserves\n\n- Protection from price volatility often seen on WBTC. \u2014 Emperor Osmo\ud83e\uddea (@Flowslikeosmo) February 21, 2023\n\nAccording to Emperor Osmo, an anonymous writer for Cosmos-based automated market maker Osmosis, the investors in AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, are yet to take notice of BTC's growing use in DeFI, as evidenced by BTC.b's rising supply.\n\n\"Over $200M of BTC has been bridged to Avalanche [to date]. The BTC DeFi narrative is definitely not priced in for AVAX,\" Osmo tweeted early Friday.\n\nAt press time, AVAX traded nearly 6% lower on the day, near $16, the lowest since Jan. 20. The cryptocurrency has seen a 50% appreciation in its market value this year, per CoinDesk data."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe emergent Bitcoin NFT ecosystem\u2014practically non-existent just months ago\u2014could balloon to $4.5 billion in market size by 2025, according to a report released Friday by Galaxy Research.\n\nAnalysts anticipate that the Bitcoin Ordinal frenzy of the last two months is no blip. They project demand for the ability to store NFTs on the world\u2019s oldest and most established blockchain will only grow in the coming years. Galaxy researchers say that even by summer of this year an entire infrastructure of products and services designed to cater to this growing market will be fully developed.\n\n\u201cIn just two months, wallets have already begun to offer the necessary support to improve user experience and marketplaces are already emerging,\u201d the report said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn late January, a project called Ordinals launched NFT-like capability on Bitcoin, allowing users to inscribe satoshis\u2014the smallest unit of Bitcoin, representing 0.00000001 BTC\u2014with unique data such as images and video. While that inscription process can be time intensive, and the process of putting those assets on the Bitcoin chain is costly, the project became an immediate success.\n\nThe number of Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions made since the end of January surpassed 200,000 earlier this week; as of this writing, over 267,000 have been made, according to public blockchain data aggregated on Dune Analytics.\n\nYuga Labs, the $4 billion company behind dominant Ethereum NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club, announced on Monday its first-ever Bitcoin-based NFT project, signaling the spread of Ordinals\u2019 appeal to the top echelons of the established, predominantly Ethereum-based NFT ecosystem.\n\n\u201cYuga\u2019s involvement [in Bitcoin NFTs] will push other artists to inscribe, which in turn will likely bring the major NFT marketplaces like OpenSea,\u201d Friday\u2019s report concluded.\n\nThe Bitcoin NFT market will likely look distinct from competitors though, due to the cost of inscribing on the network. For example, to inscribe 10,000 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs on the Bitcoin network would cost roughly $229,000 by Galaxy\u2019s estimations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCreators will likely wish to avoid such eyebrow-raising costs; Yuga\u2019s debut Bitcoin collection, TwelveFold, for example, is a limited series of just 300 artworks. For that reason, Galaxy predicts that Bitcoin will become the home of much rarer, \u201chigh quality\u201d art projects, and valuable one-of-ones, while other chains like Ethereum will continue to host massive, multi-thousand piece PFP collections at much lower costs to creators.\n\nGalaxy\u2019s rosy outlook for Bitcoin NFTs, though, is contingent on the continued success of the broader NFT market.\n\n\u201cIf the NFT ecosystem broadly does not continue to grow, then demand for Bitcoin-native NFTs will be limited,\u201d analysts wrote Friday.\n\nThe market has struggled to recover to the all-time highs of early 2022, just before Terra\u2019s collapse triggered the current crypto winter and cratered NFT prices and demand. NFT sales just notched their best month since the bear market kicked off. But that surge in trading volume is largely coming from controversial trading practices on the emergent Blur NFT marketplace, which encourages users to engage in high-volume trades in exchange for valuable loyalty rewards.\n\nBlur\u2019s sudden rise, overtaking the once-dominant OpenSea, has spurred a crisis in the established NFT market. Creator royalties, once the cornerstone of NFTs\u2019 value proposition, have been slashed by NFT marketplaces in a race to attract customers from competitors. Royalties, typically set between 5% and 10% of a sale price and paid by the seller, are how most NFT projects generate revenue. Nearly all NFT marketplaces have now made paying such fees optional, which is attractive for traders since they now pocket greater profits on each sale, but devastating for creators who lack other sources of revenue.\n\nThose hopeful that a major new NFT market like Bitcoin could change that paradigm may not be in luck. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t yet meaningfully support smart contracts, meaning there\u2019s no way for emergent Bitcoin NFT marketplaces to enforce creator royalties, or to blocklist rivals who fail to honor them.\n\n\u201cThe broader trend in the NFT ecosystem is a race to zero on royalties, or complete non-enforcement, and nothing about inscriptions is likely to alter that course,\u201d Galaxy\u2019s report said."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) investors reeling from the shock of recent cryptocurrency company failures and banking issues may face another potential problem: a recovering United States dollar.\n\nUS dollar strength reemerges\n\nNotably, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback\u2019s performance against a basket of top foreign currencies, has risen 4% from its Feb. 3 low of 100.82, amid anticipations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue raising benchmark rates to cool inflation.\n\nInflation persists\n\nAn air of caution remains as fresh U.S. data shows a recession is not yet imminent.\n\nThat includes the latest jobless claims, which fell 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 190,000 in the week ending Feb. 25, and stronger consumer spending in January.\n\nMeanwhile, 90% of the U.S. manufacturers surveyed by Bloomberg complained about rising input prices despite the easing supply-chain problems.\n\nISM manufacturing prices paid. Source: Bloomberg\n\nWhile the problem is not as severe as during the pandemic, the survey shows inflationary pressure has not gone away despite the Fed\u2019s aggressive rate hikes.\n\n\u201cRecent data suggest that consumer spending isn\u2019t slowing that much, that the labor market continues to run unsustainably hot, and that inflation is not coming down as fast as I thought,\u201d noted Fed Governor Christopher Waller, adding:\n\n\u201cIf those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more.\u201c\n\nBank of America Global Research anticipates the Fed to raise the interest rate to almost 6% from the current 4.5\u20134.75% range. Theoretically, it should renew investors\u2019 demand for the dollar by putting downside pressure on \u201criskier\u201d assets like Bitcoin.\n\nDXY chart paints inverse head-and-shoulders\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the U.S. Dollar Index looks poised to rise by more than 4.5% in the coming months due to the formation of a classic bullish reversal pattern.\n\nDubbed inverse-head-and-shoulders, the pattern develops when the price forms three troughs below a common resistance line (neckline), with the middle trough (head) deeper than the other two (left and right shoulders).\n\nDXY daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAn inverse-head-and-shoulders pattern resolves after the price breaks above the neckline and rises by as much as the maximum height between the pattern\u2019s lowest level and the neckline.\n\nIf the DXY successfully breaks above its neckline of 105.25, the likelihood of an extended recovery toward 109.75 in 2023 will be higher.\n\nBitcoin price to retest $20K?\n\nThe stronger dollar prospects come as Bitcoin bulls fail to sustain the price rally in breaking the $25,000 technical resistance level. BTC\u2019s price has tumbled by around 13% since, with macro headwinds being one of the primary reasons.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, concerns over Silvergate and potential ramifications for the industry have also kept the price in check in the past few days.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price slides 5% in 60 minutes amid Silvergate uncertainty\n\n\u201cAny liquidity concerns will have a direct impact on market conditions and may affect the access and availability of some client funds,\u201d warned John Toro, head of trading at digital-asset exchange Independent Reserve.\n\nCrypto headwinds are starting to pile up, and may explain the reason for the recent sell-off.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Mt.

        "content": "Greetings from Colorado\u2019s capital, where more than 20,000 Ethereum enthusiasts have descended to celebrate ETHDenver, a multi-day extravaganza dedicated to demos, workshops, and a whole lot of hoopla related to their favorite blockchain. As usual, many of this year\u2019s attendees turned up wearing rainbows or outlandish animal costumes\u2014a colorful pageant that felt especially striking given that this year\u2019s ETHDenver is taking place at the city\u2019s fabled stockyard and rodeo grounds, which is adorned by images of cowboys, Budweiser, and other icons typically associated with red America.\n\nI remarked on the hippie-like vibe\u2014which included a \u201czen zone\u201d and an arena full of sleepings bags for 500 Ethereum scholarship attendees to stay overnight\u2014to a 50-something crypto industry professional, who was himself dressed in a vibrant shirt and hipster glasses. He nodded and observed, \u201cBitcoin is for Republicans, Ethereum is for Democrats.\u201d It\u2019s hard to disagree. While the hardcore Bitcoin crowd is fixated with hodling and suspicion of the government, the Ethereum set is more given over to radical experimentation and eccentricity.\n\nI put this characterization to Kevin Owocki, the founder of the open software promulgator Gitcoin, who has just launched Supermodular, a venture studio that aspires to commercialize a wide variety of Ethereum innovations. He described the political labels as \u201cvery reductionist,\u201d but conceded the broad strokes are correct. \u201cBitcoin is about red meat and guns\u2026Ethereum has rainbows and unicorns,\u201d Owocki noted.\n\nAll of this underscores the degree to which crypto culture has grown and become more diverse since the libertarian Satoshi published his famous white paper in 2008, and soon after embedded a warning about central bank profligacy in the first block of Bitcoin. Today, the two most important blockchains have come to embody very different political tribes, both of which offer new and distinct ideas, but also overlap with broader progressive and conservative cultural movements.\n\nFor the thousands of mostly young people packed into the stockyard building, however, politics was far from their minds. They were instead consumed by the prospects for the next phase of Ethereum, which successfully pulled off a very difficult switch to the environmentally friendly proof of stake last year, and is on track to introduce a host of other updates that will make the blockchain faster and easier to use. In May, it will be Bitcoin\u2019s turn to be the center of the crypto universe when its devotees gather in Miami Beach for an extravaganza of their own. We\u2019ll have a dispatch from there too, but for now, it\u2019s enough to observe that\u2014even after one of the industry\u2019s toughest years ever\u2014crypto and its colorful culture are more entrenched than ever.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCoinbase purchased digital asset manager One River in a bet on future institutional demand for crypto.

In the past week, two of the country\u2019s biggest banks\u2014Nationwide and HSBC\u2014cracked down by applying daily limits for buyers or restricting credit cards from making crypto purchases.\n\nThese two banks aren\u2019t the only ones: a number of banks over the past year have got tougher. Some took a tougher stance following the collapse of mega digital asset exchange FTX back in November.\n\nAccording to most U.K. high-street banks with limits, the crackdown is to protect investors from cryptocurrency fraud. \u201cWe want to do everything we can to protect our customers and we feel that limiting payments to cryptocurrency exchanges is the best way to make sure your money stays safe,\u201d Santander says.\n\nSo what are the current rules? Here is the low-down on which banks are crypto-friendly for the retail investor.\n\nNationwide\n\nBeen offered a cryptocurrency investment opportunity? If someone offers you a low risk, high reward crypto investment, be cautious. This could be a scam. Many cryptocurrency investments aren\u2019t regulated, so you\u2019re unlikely to get your money back if something goes wrong. pic.twitter.com/bgb3PLbAHT \u2014 Nationwide Building Society (@AskNationwide) October 15, 2021\n\nMajor high-street bank Nationwide this week said it was setting up new restrictions to \u201chelp protect you and to try and keep your money safe.\u201d Customers can no longer buy crypto with credit cards and with debit cards, and there are daily limits of \u00a35,000 ($5,965).\n\nHSBC\n\nHSBC this week also imposed tougher rules. Now, customers cannot buy any digital assets from exchanges using credit cards. Those who bank with HSBC can buy crypto with a debit card through certain U.K.-regulated platforms\u2014but not exchanges like Coinbase.\n\nThe banking giant has said it has no interest in Bitcoin and has banned customers from buying stocks of companies with Bitcoin exposure.\n\nLloyds\n\nLloyds allows its clients to buy crypto via U.K.-regulated platforms and make withdrawals from exchanges such as Coinbase\u2014but only using debit cards.\n\nIt was one of the first banks in the U.K. to stop its clients from buying crypto with credit cards back in 2018.\n\nNatWest\n\nNatWest Group CEO Alison Rose last month said that the bank had \u201ctaken a pretty hard line as a bank on crypto.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2021, the bank barred corporate customers who deal in cryptocurrencies. That means companies like crypto exchanges with a base in the U.K. cannot hold accounts at NatWest.\n\nThe FCA Has 5 Entirely Reasonable Concerns About Cryptocurrency\n\nBut right now, according to the bank, that \u201cdoesn't mean that we block cryptocurrency payments altogether but we will restrict payments to cryptocurrency exchanges that present the highest risk of financial harm.\u201d\n\nYou can use a NatWest account to buy digital assets from exchanges such as Coinbase. Amounts are limited, according to the bank, though NatWest has not revealed exactly by how much.\n\nBarclays\n\nBarclays bank does not allow customers to buy or sell crypto through its online banking platform. Would-be investors can buy crypto via a regulated, FCA-approved broker, though.\n\nBarclays was one of the U.K. banks that stopped customers making payments to crypto exchange Binance in 2021 after the British regulatory body FCA issued a warning over exchange.\n\nSantander\n\nHigh-street bank Santander announced last year that it would be limiting U.K. customers from making large crypto transactions. As it stands, those who bank with Santander can make single transactions of \u00a31,000, with a total limit of \u00a33,000 in any rolling 30-day period.\n\nA crypto trader who banks with Santander told Decrypt that his account was closed without warning after making withdrawals from Coinbase.\n\nWise\n\nFormerly known as TransferWise, Wise does not deal in cryptocurrencies at all. And you can\u2019t use an account to buy digital assets from an exchange. But Wise customers can receive money to their account from a platform that deals with crypto if it is regulated in the EU or UK.\n\nMonzo\n\nYou can buy cryptocurrency on big, established exchanges such as Coinbase (but not Binance) with popular challenger bank Monzo, but it \u201cmay block a small number of transactions based on risk.\u201d The bank does not say how big or small these transactions are.\n\nStarling\n\nChallenger bank Starling is one of the strictest: it has banned customers from all crypto-related payments. \u201cWe consider crypto activity to be high risk,\u201d the bank said in November. Starling clients told Decrypt that the move was sudden.\n\nHi there \ud83d\udc4b We always review our position in relation to financial crime. We consider crypto activity to be high risk. We\u2019ve taken the decision to prevent all card payments to crypto merchants and to implement further restrictions on outgoing and incoming transfers. \u2014 Starling Bank (@StarlingBank) November 22, 2022\n\nRevolut\n\nThis challenger bank is the most crypto-friendly of them all: users can buy, sell, and store a number of digital assets via the mobile banking app. And just last month, the bank launched a staking service for Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, and Tezos."

This adds to costs and time and is counterproductive for entrepreneurs. Now, I see a great opportunity for founders to base their businesses in one location.\u201d\n\nThe United Arab Emirates has over 40 free zones, including the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).\n\nAs living and business costs in Ras Al Khaimah are 50% less than in Dubai, Heaver said the emirate\u2019s free zone would be a \u201cgreat point for startup companies.\u201d\n\nThe government will also assist virtual asset service providers (VASPs) with banking requirements through its own entities and relationships, the lawyer said."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $22,000, These Are The Reasons - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In the last few hours, the Bitcoin price has experienced the most violent crash since the collapse of FTX. The BTC price crashed by $1,300 within an hour and briefly fell below $22,000. Remarkably, the price drop occurred with the start of the trading day in Hong Kong.\n\nWhat Are The Reasons For The Bitcoin Price Crash?\n\nProbably the most obvious reason for the Bitcoin price crash is the uncertainty that arose yesterday around Silvergate bank, which plays a major role in providing liquidity to the market by providing a gateway to the fiat money system.\n\nThe bank delayed its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday. The resulting FUD over financial difficulties caused the bank\u2019s stock price to plummet by more than 50%. Several crypto companies, including Coinbase, Paxos, Kraken, and Galaxy Digital have subsequently terminated their business relationships with the bank.\n\nHowever, reducing the price slump, for this reason, would be too simplistic. As analyst Miles Deutscher writes via Twitter, the headwinds for the crypto market are currently piling up. In addition to Silvergate, these include Mt. Gox payouts, the Shanghai ETH unlock, a hot CPI (50bps now a real possibility), mass liquidations, and equity market weakness.\n\n\u201cNote, not all of these necessarily have a substantive basis. But nor do they need to cause de-risking. I think a combination of these factors led to a correction, with liquidations exacerbating price action,\u201d Deutscher explained.\n\nIn particular, the gigantic long liquidations likely played a significant role in causing the crash to occur as strongly as it did in such a short period of time. According to CoinGlass, long positions of over $205 million have been liquidated in the entire crypto market so far. $185 million in mostly long positions were liquidated within just 45 minutes. Bitcoin recorded the highest liquidations worth $73 million.\n\nBinance Spot Whale Responsible?\n\nAlso, analyst Skew observed conspicuity in Bitcoin spot CVD buckets and delta orders and referred to the chart below. According to the analyst, a large Binance spot sale led to the cascade of long liquidations:\n\nAs you can see here Binance Spot nuked 1 min before every other spot exchange. Significant size behind this sell off. (Someone probably exited crypto today). Key price $22K\n\nOn-chain analysis company Santiment writes that it\u2019s been more than 4 months since Bitcoin fell by 5% or more in a single hour. But an hour ago (1 am \u2013 2 am UTC), that streak was broken. \u201cA quick recovery will be dependent on how much worry the crowd shows, allowing whales to scoop weak-handed coins, \u201caccording to Santiment.\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin was trading at $22,374, down 4.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nUK banks are getting tougher on customers using crypto. In the past week, two of the country\u2019s biggest banks\u2014Nationwide and HSBC\u2014cracked down by applying daily limits for buyers or restricting credit cards from making crypto purchases.\n\nThese two banks aren\u2019t the only ones: a number of banks over the past year have got tougher. Some took a tougher stance following the collapse of mega digital asset exchange FTX back in November.\n\nAccording to most U.K. high-street banks with limits, the crackdown is to protect investors from cryptocurrency fraud. \u201cWe want to do everything we can to protect our customers and we feel that limiting payments to cryptocurrency exchanges is the best way to make sure your money stays safe,\u201d Santander says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo what are the current rules? Here is the low-down on which banks are crypto-friendly for the retail investor.\n\nNationwide\n\nBeen offered a cryptocurrency investment opportunity? If someone offers you a low risk, high reward crypto investment, be cautious. This could be a scam. Many cryptocurrency investments aren\u2019t regulated, so you\u2019re unlikely to get your money back if something goes wrong. pic.twitter.com/bgb3PLbAHT \u2014 Nationwide Building Society (@AskNationwide) October 15, 2021\n\nMajor high-street bank Nationwide this week said it was setting up new restrictions to \u201chelp protect you and to try and keep your money safe.\u201d Customers can no longer buy crypto with credit cards and with debit cards, and there are daily limits of \u00a35,000 ($5,965).\n\nHSBC\n\nHSBC this week also imposed tougher rules. Now, customers cannot buy any digital assets from exchanges using credit cards. Those who bank with HSBC can buy crypto with a debit card through certain U.K.-regulated platforms\u2014but not exchanges like Coinbase.\n\nThe banking giant has said it has no interest in Bitcoin and has banned customers from buying stocks of companies with Bitcoin exposure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLloyds\n\nLloyds allows its clients to buy crypto via U.K.-regulated platforms and make withdrawals from exchanges such as Coinbase\u2014but only using debit cards.\n\nIt was one of the first banks in the U.K. to stop its clients from buying crypto with credit cards back in 2018.\n\nNatWest\n\nNatWest Group CEO Alison Rose last month said that the bank had \u201ctaken a pretty hard line as a bank on crypto.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2021, the bank barred corporate customers who deal in cryptocurrencies. That means companies like crypto exchanges with a base in the U.K. cannot hold accounts at NatWest.\n\nBut right now, according to the bank, that \u201cdoesn't mean that we block cryptocurrency payments altogether but we will restrict payments to cryptocurrency exchanges that present the highest risk of financial harm.\u201d\n\nYou can use a NatWest account to buy digital assets from exchanges such as Coinbase. Amounts are limited, according to the bank, though NatWest has not revealed exactly by how much.\n\nBarclays\n\nBarclays bank does not allow customers to buy or sell crypto through its online banking platform. Would-be investors can buy crypto via a regulated, FCA-approved broker, though.\n\nBarclays was one of the U.K. banks that stopped customers making payments to crypto exchange Binance in 2021 after the British regulatory body FCA issued a warning over exchange.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSantander\n\nHigh-street bank Santander announced last year that it would be limiting U.K. customers from making large crypto transactions. As it stands, those who bank with Santander can make single transactions of \u00a31,000, with a total limit of \u00a33,000 in any rolling 30-day period.\n\nA crypto trader who banks with Santander told Decrypt that his account was closed without warning after making withdrawals from Coinbase.\n\nWise\n\nFormerly known as TransferWise, Wise does not deal in cryptocurrencies at all. And you can\u2019t use an account to buy digital assets from an exchange. But Wise customers can receive money to their account from a platform that deals with crypto if it is regulated in the EU or UK.\n\nMonzo\n\nYou can buy cryptocurrency on big, established exchanges such as Coinbase (but not Binance) with popular challenger bank Monzo, but it \u201cmay block a small number of transactions based on risk.\u201d The bank does not say how big or small these transactions are.\n\nStarling\n\nChallenger bank Starling is one of the strictest: it has banned customers from all crypto-related payments. \u201cWe consider crypto activity to be high risk,\u201d the bank said in November. Starling clients told Decrypt that the move was sudden.\n\nHi there \ud83d\udc4b We always review our position in relation to financial crime. We consider crypto activity to be high risk. We\u2019ve taken the decision to prevent all card payments to crypto merchants and to implement further restrictions on outgoing and incoming transfers. \u2014 Starling Bank (@StarlingBank) November 22, 2022\n\nRevolut\n\nThis challenger bank is the most crypto-friendly of them all: users can buy, sell, and store a number of digital assets via the mobile banking app. And just last month, the bank launched a staking service for Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, and Tezos."

        "content": "Osmosis made improvements to its protocol, however, its TVL declined.\n\nDespite Osmosis\u2019 decline in TVL and revenue, Cosmos Hub remained unaffected\n\nOn 2 March, Messari revealed Osmosis\u2019 plans to integrate Bitcoin [BTC] into its network for additional security. Osmosis is a major part of the Cosmos [ATOM] ecosystem, and improvements in the Osmosis protocol could possibly be reflected in the Cosmos Hub.\n\n.@osmosiszone is integrating #Bitcoin security! How? +Checkpoints sent to @babylon_chain via IBC\n\n+Single checkpoint from Babylon is then sent to Bitcoin\n\n+Bitcoin timestamps the received checkpoint, which can then be read by participating @Cosmos zones https://t.co/58djE304gA pic.twitter.com/4o3NWlAA7z \u2014 Messari (@MessariCrypto) March 1, 2023\n\nRead Cosmos\u2019 [ATOM] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nIncreasing security\n\nOsmosis\u2019 security would be working through checkpoints on the network. These checkpoints would be sent to Bitcoin through the Babylon chain, which would then be time-stamped by the network. Finally, other Cosmos zones will read these timestamps.\n\nDespite Osmosis\u2019 attempts to improve its ecosystem through security, the TVL of the network continued to decline. Over the last week, the total value locked by the Osmosis protocol declined from $214.19 million to $190.6 million, according to DeFi Llama. The declining TVL of Osmosis impacted the revenue generated by the protocol, which ended up decreasing.\n\nCosmos remains strong, but ATOM gets affected\n\nEven though Osmosis wasn\u2019t able to show growth in terms of revenue collection, the Cosmos Hub protocol\u2019s revenue remained unaffected. According to data provided by Token Terminal, the revenue generated by Cosmos Hub increased by 51.03%.\n\nDespite the struggles of its most prominent DEX, the activity on the Cosmos Hub increased massively. This could be why Cosmos witnessed growth in revenue collection.\n\nEven though the Cosmos Hub protocol showed growth, the same could not be said for its native cryptocurrency, ATOM. Its price fell by 4.93% over the last month. Consequently, ATOM\u2019s volume decreased as well, as it fell from 502.11 million to 119.91 million in the last month, according to Santiment.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ATOM\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nAnother concerning indicator for ATOM was the declining development activity, which suggested that no new upgrades and updates on the network were on their way to Cosmos Hub.\n\nA decline in development activity would make it difficult for ATOM to see growth in the near future, despite its protocol seeing success in various areas."

        "title": "Bullish or Bearish? A Closer Look at Bitcoin\u2019s Historical Performance in March - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Following an ultimately flat February, eager investors are curious: what\u2019s in store for Bitcoin\u2019s price this March?\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how Bitcoin has performed each March over the last 12 years. On average, the asset\u2019s price has risen by 10% each time.\n\nBitcoin, March, and the Halving\n\nIn its earliest days, March wasn\u2019t a particularly bullish month for BTC. The cryptocurrency fell by 8.2% to just $0.79 in 2011, and went on to move 0% in March of the following year.\n\nThings changed in 2013, however, when Bitcoin closed the month at $92.19 \u2013 a whopping 176.2% rise from the start of the month. This came five months after Bitcoin\u2019s very first halving in November 2012.\n\n\u201cThe halving,\u201d refers to when Bitcoin\u2019s supply issuance per block is cut in half every 210,000 blocks, roughly once every 4 years. This creates a supply crunch that\u2019s historically triggered major bullish price momentum for Bitcoin each time it occurs.\n\nThe next five years marked a return to bearishness. From 2014 through to 2018, Bitcoin fell by 16.9%, 4%, 4.8%, 9.2%, and 32.8% in each consecutive year \u2013 the latter being Bitcoin\u2019s worst March on record. Like in 2013, Bitcoin\u2019s decline in March 2018 was in line with the halving cycle, just one year after Bitcoin\u2019s timely bull market in 2017.\n\nWhile Bitcoin saw some reprieve with a 7.4% boost in March 2019, March 2020 defied the halving schedule. Bitcoin plunged 24.8% \u2013 largely a response to \u201cBlack Thursday\u201d when stocks and crypto plummeted from growing panic around the fast-spreading coronavirus. Bitcoin had fallen by over 50% on March 12, from over $8000 to under $4000.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s third halving occurred two months later, helping spur March rallies in the following two years, including 30.2% and 5.4% boosts in 2021 and 2022 respectively.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nRecent analysis from CryptoQuant suggests that Bitcoin may be due for some selling pressure in the short term, stemming from a combination of whales and miners.\n\nSpecifically, the amount of Bitcoin both groups have been sending to exchanges is on the rise this week \u2013 a well-recognized sign that investors intend to liquidate their coins.\n\n\u201cThe BTC Whale Rato metric is high for the next day in SPOT exchanges and this rise is often due to large inflows,\u201d explained the CryptoQuant analyst abramchart. \u201cThis behavior can lead to selling pressure.\u201d\n\n"

Moreover, the value of Ethereum went below $1600 to stand at $1568, marking a 4.89 percent fall from the previous day.\n\nAs per the recent information, Silvergate Capital, a bank that specialises in cryptocurrencies, has shocked the whole cryptocurrency industry. Due to a 'crisis of confidence', the bank has postponed filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe current scenario has caused the crypto market to experience significant selling pressure. Around $50 billion in investor capital has been lost in the last few hours as a result of the over 5 percent decline in Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nAs the market struggled, the price of Solana plunged by 5.19 percent to $20.93. On the other hand, Litecoin also suffered negatively with an 8 percent fall to $89.11. The reduction in the market further led to a fall in Cardano's value by 6 percent to stand at $0.335050. This decrease was continued in XRP and Monero by 3.42 percent and 4.44 percent, respectively. The value of Avalache tumbled 7 percent to trade at $16, along with noticed lows in Cosmos of 6 percent to $11.86.\n\nOn 3 March, the global crypto market cap decreased by 4.59 percent to $1.02 trillion in the past 24 hours. Contrarily, the total crypto market volume increased 12.87 percent to stand at 53.93 billion.\n\nTop gainers and losers\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the top gainers were Threshold, ssv.network, yearn.finance, and XDC Network. Contrarily, the top losers were dYdX, Frax Share , Stacks, and Conflux.\n\nMeme coins plunge\n\nOn Friday, the value of meme coins plunged. Shiba Inu recorded a slip of 6.29 percent to $0.000011. The value of Dogecoin fell 7 percent to $0.075340. This continued in Dogelon Mars with a 6.50 percent decrease.\n\nMetaverse tokens in the red\n\nA majority of the top metaverse tokens plunged. The price of The Sandbox recorded a loss of 8.74 percent. Moreover, Axie Infinity fell by 8.87 percent, along with the sink in Decentraland by 7.73 percent."

        "title": "Best Bitcoin Ordinals Wallets out There - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Bitcoin is beginning to emerge as an NFT ecosystem. Ordinals is a Bitcoin blockchain protocol that allows users to create one-of-a-kind digital assets. This protocol requires a taproot wallet address. Users can mint and trade NFTs on the blockchain with this new technology.\n\nHowever, interacting with the blockchain and acquiring an Ordinal can be a slow, murky, and centralized process. Because of the growing demand for more user-friendly interfaces for those seeking Ordinals, web3 developers have stepped in to fill the void.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent a specific ordinal number on the Bitcoin blockchain. They are created by inscribing an ordinal number into a Bitcoin transaction, which is then recorded on the blockchain. Each ordinal is unique and cannot be replicated or duplicated.\n\nThe Best Bitcoin Ordinals Wallets\n\nAre you looking for a reliable and secure wallet to store your Bitcoin Ordinals? Look no further than the Ordinals Wallet, Hiro Wallet, and Xverse Wallet.\n\nThese three wallets have been pioneers in the world of Bitcoin NFTs and offer advanced features to help you manage your digital assets.\n\n1. Atomic Wallet\n\nAtomic Wallet supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, and provides secure storage for users\u2019 Bitcoin holdings. Like Ordinals Wallet, Atomic Wallet prioritizes the security of users\u2019 private keys and transaction data by employing encryption technology.\n\nAdditionally, Atomic Wallet offers additional features such as built-in staking options, allowing users to earn passive income on their cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nBy offering both a versatile multi-currency wallet and dedicated Bitcoin wallet functionality, Atomic Wallet provides users with the flexibility to manage their Bitcoin assets alongside their other digital assets.\n\nThis versatility makes Atomic Wallet an attractive choice for individuals looking for a comprehensive wallet solution that caters to their various cryptocurrency needs.\n\nWhether users prefer the specialized focus of Ordinals Wallet on Bitcoin or the broader range of supported cryptocurrencies offered by Atomic Wallet, both options prioritize security and aim to provide a user-friendly experience for managing Bitcoin assets.\n\n1. Ordinals Wallet\n\nThe Bitcoin Ordinals Wallet is the newest wallet to come out with explicit support for Ordinals Inscriptions.\n\nIt went live on February 16th and has been gaining a lot of traction since then. The wallet allows users to store, send, and receive Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs (non-fungible tokens).\n\nThe Ordinals Wallet is a dedicated wallet designed specifically for storing and managing Bitcoin Ordinals. It offers advanced security features such as multi-signature support, two-factor authentication, and cold storage options.\n\nThe wallet also allows users to view their transaction history and manage their digital assets with ease.\n\n2. Xverse Wallet\n\nXverse is a Bitcoin wallet designed specifically for web3 applications. The wallet allows users to store, send, and receive Bitcoin while interacting with decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nIt also supports features such as token swapping and trading digital assets. The most unique feature of the Xverse wallet is its support for Ordinals Inscriptions, a protocol allowing users to securely transfer tokens without needing a third-party intermediary.\n\nThis makes it easier and faster to trade tokens on the blockchain. It also provides enhanced security, as no private keys are ever exposed when transferring funds.\n\nOne advantage of using Xverse is its availability across platforms \u2013 there\u2019s an app available on iOS, Google Play, and the App Store. The simple user interface makes it easy to navigate around the wallet and find what you need.\n\nXverse has some drawbacks as well. For instance, it can be difficult to use for beginners because of all the advanced features. Additionally, since it\u2019s still relatively new compared to other web wallets, there may be compatibility issues with certain dApps or tokens.\n\nOverall, Xverse is a great choice if you\u2019re looking for a Bitcoin wallet specifically designed for web3 applications that support state-of-the-art features like Ordinals Inscriptions. If you don\u2019t mind dealing with some potential compatibility issues then it could be a great option for you.\n\n3. Hiro Wallet\n\nHiro Wallet just launched its testnet on February 14, before both Xverse and Ordinals Wallet.\n\nHiro Wallet CEO Mark Hendrickson has stated that the company\u2019s intentions to provide comprehensive support for Stacks-based NFTs and Ordinal inscriptions are just getting started.\n\nHiro Wallet works in the same way as Xverse. Gamma is the inscriber, and Ordinals are sent straight to a user\u2019s account under a section called \u201cCollectibles.\u201d Users will have easy access to their Ordinals collection in this way.\n\nHiro Wallet, on the other hand, is distinguished by its support for Stacks-based NFTs, allowing its users to safely trade and store a wide variety of digital assets on the blockchain. Further upgrades designed to improve the user experience will be released shortly.\n\nAs more and more firms offer interesting and novel ways for customers to interact with digital assets, the introduction of Hiro Wallet\u2019s testnet is indicative of the rising interest and innovation in the blockchain and cryptocurrency field.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nIn conclusion, if you\u2019re looking for a reliable and secure way to store your Bitcoin Ordinals, consider using one of these three wallets: the Ordinals Wallet, Hiro Wallet, or Xverse Wallet.\n\nEach offers unique features that cater to different needs but all provide top-notch security measures so you can rest assured that your digital assets are safe and sound."

Sell Your Bitcoin Through a Broker\n\nWith traditional investing, a broker helps complete financial transactions using your funds. A crypto broker acts similarly, making crypto transactions based on your investment goals. Using a broker may be a good option for beginner investors, and it may be more suitable for those who want to make smaller crypto purchases.\n\n3. Sell Your Bitcoin With a Peer-to-Peer Trade\n\nPeer-to-peer trades may reduce transaction time and fees. However, you must be aware of how to complete peer-to-peer trades safely to avoid scams and fraudulent buyers. The safest option for peer-to-peer trades is to use a reputable peer-to-peer platform like LocalBitcoins. You can sign up and choose an ideal location for your buyer, as well as send trade requests on the platform\u2019s marketplace. Many peer-to-peer platforms will also offer escrow options so that your bitcoin isn\u2019t released until you receive payment.\n\n4. Convert Your Bitcoin to Another Crypto\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get rid of your bitcoin specifically, you could also choose to convert it to another cryptocurrency. This gives you the opportunity to stay in cryptocurrency investing without holding too much bitcoin. However, you would need to transfer it to your bank account in the future to cash out for fiat currency, which could add more time and fees. In addition, you will also need to choose a crypto exchange that allows for more trading pairs and that supports multiple types of cryptocurrencies.\n\n5. Use a Crypto Debit Card\n\nCrypto debit cards are good for investors who don\u2019t want to sell off large amounts of bitcoin. Instead, you can use the crypto debit card to make smaller purchases directly with vendors and stores, similar to regular debit cards. Many crypto debit cards also allow you to earn cash back and other rewards, as well as access ATMs. Some crypto debit cards will also allow you to add funds to your account using multiple types of cryptocurrencies or fiat currency.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\n6. Shop at Stores That Accept Bitcoin\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to transfer funds to your bank account, you can save time by shopping directly with stores that accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a payment method. However, be aware that there may be high transaction fees. In addition, the fluctuating price of cryptocurrency can affect the purchase price and refunds. Therefore, you may choose to only use cryptocurrency for large in-store purchases, rather than small everyday purchases.\n\n7. Use a Bitcoin ATM\n\nBitcoin ATMs connect to platforms like crypto exchanges to facilitate buying and selling transactions. While some bitcoin ATMs will only allow you to buy bitcoin, you can also find some that allow you to sell your bitcoin and immediately receive cash, similar to a traditional ATM. You must have an account already set up with the platform. Then, you can simply enter your wallet address to cash out.\n\nFinal Take\n\nOverall, it\u2019s fairly easy to cash out your bitcoin. You can choose from various methods depending on your investing goals and spending decisions. However, consider factors such as timing, fees and crypto taxes. Choose a method that is convenient and affordable by researching each platform\u2019s transfer times and transaction fees.\n\nFAQ Here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about selling bitcoin. Can you cash out bitcoin to your bank account? Yes, you can cash out bitcoin directly to your bank account by using a crypto exchange. But keep in mind, you might have to pay transaction fees.\n\nIs it expensive to cash out bitcoin? Some methods of cashing out your bitcoin do come with added fees. One method that can reduce your fees is peer-to-peer trades. Just be aware that with this option, there are occasionally scammers posing as fake buyers so you should use a reputable platform.\n\nHere are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about selling bitcoin.\n\nInvesting for Everyone"

        "content": "Time has changed, and the world with greater modernity and advanced technologies. There is also a change in the pattern of how women save their money and park them for future wealth creation. In recent times, women are taking on more challenging tasks, they're not shy about taking risks when it comes to investment. One such risk would be investing in cryptocurrencies as the market is volatile and highly sensitive. Despite its unpredictable tendency, female investors have likely held more virtual digital assets than male investors, a study shows.\n\nAs per WazirX Survey for the occasion of Women's Day, trading volume on its platform by female users increased by 3.3% in a year.\n\nThe trading volume in crypto assets by female investors rose from 15.27% in 2021 to 18.57% in 2022 despite the year bringing in a liquidity crunch in the market. The year 2022 has borne witness to collapses of major stablecoins, liquidation, bankruptcies, and illiquidity in cryptocurrencies owing to macroeconomic uncertainties.\n\nNot just that, the WazirX survey reveals that the average value of Crypto held per female user on the platform is \u20b99,650, which is almost 30% more than the average value of Crypto held per male user, which is \u20b96,676.\n\nThat being said, women investors now have combined crypto worth \u20b9354.9 crore in their balance.\n\nFurther, the survey highlighted that the highest number of signups among females came from the age group of 25 - 35 in the last two years. It was 51.02% and 44.28% in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Closely following are the female users between 36 - 50 with 29.98% and 32.54% in 2021 and 2022 respectively.\n\nAccording to WazirX, over a period of time it has been observed that Crypto has been preferred by women over traditional assets ever since its adoption started growing. With low entry barriers, better access, and inclusion for users, women find it easier to invest in virtual digital assets.\n\nBitcoin was the most loved cryptocurrency among female investors with a weightage of 21.6%. But Tether with 21% weightage in total volumes emerged as the second most popular digital asset among females. Others were --- WazirX (16.4%), Ethereum (14.3%), Shibu Inu (13.6%), and Dogecoin (13.1%).\n\nAmong the women who had more than 30% of their assets allocated to cryptocurrencies were majorly in the age group of 30-45, followed by the age group of 18-30. Further, 24% of women with more than 30%of their assets in crypto have been investing for more than 3 years.\n\nAs per the survey, among the major reasons to invest in cryptocurrencies would financial independence. 45% of women in the age group of 45-60, 41% in the age group of 18-30, and 34% of women between the ages 30-45 invested in crypto for financial independence. This has been a trend globally where women have chosen crypto for personal wealth creation and portfolio diversification. While 19% of respondents invested in crypto because of combined factors of high returns and potential utility.\n\nWhile 25% of women feel that with crypto investment, they are socially appreciated for trying new forms of financial assets. Whereas, 15% feel that they are considered financially knowledgeable. And 10% feel that they are perceived as knowledgeable of the latest technological developments.\n\nOut of the respondents who were inspired to buy virtual digital assets by external factors --- 51% were influenced by their partners, whereas 32% were influenced by news articles, social media, market trends, etc.\n\nNotably, respondents in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Karnataka, and West Bengal have the highest number of investors who have invested in crypto on their own decision, as well as done sufficient research on the assets.\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "title": "Bitcoin Core Review 2024 | Features, Pricing, Details - CoinJournal",
        "content": "What is the Bitcoin Core Wallet?\n\nBitcoin Core is the fundamental software used by Bitcoin users to send, receive, and store Bitcoin. There are numerous other wallets that can do these tasks today, but in 2009 when Bitcoin was new, Bitcoin Core was the only shop in town. Satoshi Nakamoto created the wallet to serve as a dashboard for the sending and receiving of Bitcoin. To distinguish it from the Bitcoin Network, Bitcoin Core is sometimes referred to as the \u201cSatoshi Client\u201d.\n\nPeople who run the Bitcoin core wallet are running a \u201cFull Node\u201d in the Bitcoin Network, to which the Bitcoin Core Wallet is connected. This means that the Bitcoin Core wallet helps the Bitcoin network confirm and relay Bitcoin transactions (sending, receiving, purchases). The Bitcoin Core wallet is necessary for the Bitcoin network to function at all.\n\nThis means that Bitcoin Core is more than a wallet, but for everyday users, its wallet functionality is all that\u2019s necessary to understand. We\u2019ll cover the deeper functionality in the rest of this Bitcoin Core review, but new users should not be worried that we\u2019ll get too technically complex.\n\nWho Runs the Bitcoin Core Wallet\n\nUnderstanding the Bitcoin Core Wallet is necessary to comprehend Bitcoin as a whole. Bitcoin is a decentralized network, meaning that there\u2019s no one who is in charge of it in the same way that Jeff Bezos is in charge of Amazon, for example. Instead, the network is operated by people who run the Bitcoin Core Wallet (Full Node runners) and miners (those who use powerful computers to confirm Bitcoin transactions and mine new Bitcoins).\n\nThe Bitcoin Core code is, however, maintained by volunteers. People all over the world can make suggestions about how Bitcoin Core may be improved. These are called Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, or BIPs. BIPs are voted upon (and often simply argued about) by developers and the community. Eventually one or more BIPs is incorporated into the Bitcoin Core Code, and a new version of the Bitcoin Core Wallet is released.\n\nA number of developers have become closely associated with the Bitcoin Core development, including Luke Dash, Jr., Gavin Andresen, and others. Because changes to Bitcoin Core are heavily debated in the Bitcoin community, developers like these are sometimes (read: always) controversial.\n\nWhy Does the Bitcoin Core Wallet Matter So Much to Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin (the network, the cryptocurrency) won\u2019t work without the Bitcoin Core wallet. This is because the Bitcoin Core wallet on your device is more than a wallet, it\u2019s a small but necessary part of the entire Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin network is made of Nodes, and each Bitcoin Core wallet is a full node. Together, all of the nodes in the world are a gigantic distributed technology that uses the internet to send Bitcoins all around in a secure and trackable manner.\n\nSo Bitcoin wouldn\u2019t work without Bitcoin Core. That\u2019s why changes to the Bitcoin Core software are so contentious in the cryptocurrency industry. Software updates are made periodically, but large portions of the community don\u2019t agree about what those changes should be. When a consensus (or something close to a consensus is released), a new version of the Bitcoin Core software is released, and miners and node runners around the world download it and use it.\n\nBitcoin Core Wallet Controversies\n\nAnyone can write updates to Bitcoin Core, but unless miners and node holders run the software, it doesn\u2019t matter. Occasionally, however, significant interests arise in Bitcoin and a large group of miners will start to use an alternative version of Bitcoin Core. This is what gave rise to alternative forms of Bitcoin, including the still popular Bitcoin Cash. These alternative visions of what Bitcoin should be cause turmoil in the Bitcoin community, and the occasional schism, but nonetheless Bitcoin remains going strong to this day.\n\nHow to Use the Bitcoin Core Wallet\n\nThe Bitcoin Core wallet is pretty easy to use, but you\u2019ve got to understand some basic functionality about Bitcoin to make it work. The good thing is, this will help you become adept at using all cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin, so it\u2019s definitely worth your time to learn this stuff. Let\u2019s start by downloading the Bitcoin Core Wallet so that you can poke around on your own. Do this by going to Bitcoin.org and downloading the software for your operating system (Bitcoin Core Windows, Bitcoin Core Linus, Bitcoin Core Mac, and Bitcoin Core Ubuntu are all options).\n\nDownloading and Installing Bitcoin Core Wallet\n\nBitcoin Core is currently in version 0.16.0. To run a full node as well as using the wallet, you\u2019ll have to download the 155 GB Bitcoin blockchain. We won\u2019t go over that here, but there are endless resources about how to do just that if you are interested.\n\nFor Mac users (and those with certain settings on other operating systems), you\u2019ll have to confirm that you do wish to open the software using the option in System Preferences > Security. This means that even though the Bitcoin Core wallet wasn\u2019t created by a big developer like Apple, it\u2019s still OK to run on your computer.\n\nAs you open the wallet, it will undergo a fairly long process (several minutes) during which time your copy of Bitcoin Core\u2019s \u201cLedger\u201d (a complete record of every transaction that has ever occurred on the Bitcoin network) will be checked against every other node and miner in the network. Be patient. Eventually your wallet will open up and you\u2019ll be able to use it.\n\nUsing Your Bitcoin Core Wallet to Send, Receive, and Store\n\nThere are a number of things to note in this simple interface. We\u2019ll go through all of them so you have no confusion.\n\nOverview : this shows you most of the most relevant information related to your Bitcoin core wallet.On the left you can see how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet, any Bitcoin that is currently being transferred into your wallet, and how many transactions you have performed with this wallet.

Private Keys are an important idea to understand. Just like your wallet address, your private key is a long alpha-numeric code associated with your account. If you were to take your computer that holds the Bitcoin Core software and throw it into the Sun, you could simply get another computer and recreate your wallet using your Private Key. Think of it as the secret code that can clone your Bitcoin core wallet (and the Bitcoins it contains) anywhere in the world.\n\nThe thing is, anyone else who has the private key could do the same thing. You should keep your Private Key as safe as possible. This writer writes private keys down in two different locations, where a flood or fire could destroy one but not the other. This writer also never stores private keys online, as they could be hacked. Keep your private key safe, and your Bitcoins should be safe forever.\n\nOther Important Ideas About the Bitcoin Core Wallet\n\nHere are some important ideas which will help you understand Bitcoin and keep your Bitcoins safe.\n\nYour wallet doesn\u2019t \u201cstore\u201d your Bitcoin. Instead, it\u2019s just an interface through which you can interact with your Bitcoins. Your Bitcoins \u201clive\u201d on the blockchain, and are linked to your Private Key. Only those with the private key can use the Bitcoin Core wallet interface to view, send, and receive Bitcoins linked to your Bitcoin core wallet address. All of this means that even if your Bitcoin core wallet device is lost, stolen, or destroyed, your Bitcoins still exist safely on the blockchain. As long as you have your Private Key, you can recover them.\n\nBitcoin is not truly anonymous as is sometimes supposed. A complete record of every Bitcoin transaction is captured in the public ledger system shared by Bitcoin nodes and miners. Though it would be time- and resource-consuming to retroactively assemble a user\u2019s transaction record, it would be possible. Some users use \u201ctumblers\u201d and other methods to achieve something resembling Bitcoin anonymity.\n\nFinal Thoughts About Bitcoin Core Wallet\n\nBitcoin and the Bitcoin Core Wallet are innovations in global economics and computer science. To learn them is to learn the heart of cryptocurrency as a whole, and the ripples of this innovation will continue to be felt for years, if not decades, to come. The basic functionality of the Bitcoin Core wallet front-end is easy for the beginner to appreciate, but the backend takes months of research and experience to fully appreciate.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown how long Bitcoin will remain dominant over the blockchain industry, or whether it will achieve the million dollar mark various analysts have prophesied. It\u2019s true that Bitcoin\u2019s value results from an elegant application of supply relative to global demand, and a simple software solution to keeping track of all of the bookkeeping.\n\nWhatever becomes of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Core wallet will remain useful for many years to come, and will be a testament to a significant innovation in history. Whether or not the history of global finance will hinge on Bitcoin will be decided by future generations. But as members of the present, an acquaintance with the Bitcoin wallet is essential both to using Bitcoin and to using its elegant design."

        "title": "What is Bitcoin Halving: Effects And Future - ClearTax",
        "content": "If you are a Bitcoin miner, you may have heard of the term called Bitcoin halving. It is a process that occurs after a set number of blocks are mined.\n\nBitcoin halving affects the investors, miners and the whole Bitcoin ecosystem. Let's discuss it in detail.\n\nBitcoin halving\n\nBitcoin halving is an event in which block rewards for mining Bitcoins are cut in half. This happens after the mining of every 210,000 blocks or roughly four years. This way, Bitcoin enforces artificial price inflation to ensure a steady rise in its value. This process will continue until miners completely mine the 21 million Bitcoins on this blockchain.\n\nThe last Bitcoin halving event took place on 11 May 2020. The current reward for mining a Bitcoin block is 6.25 BTC.\n\nBesides miners getting lower block rewards, the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation also reduces. This, in turn, inflates its price as its demand increases due to the lower amount of new supply.\n\nGenerally, a huge crash always follows a price rise, but the value of Bitcoin after the crash is certainly more than the value of this crypto coin before the halving event.\n\nFor example, after the halving of 2016, in 2017-2018, Bitcoin\u2019s value rose to $20,000. Like any rise in the market, it is followed by a crash, bringing down its value to $3,200. It may seem like a heavy crash, but before halving, Bitcoin\u2019s value was at $650, increasing its value.\n\nEffects of Bitcoin halving\n\nBitcoin halving has a chain effect. All individuals related to the currency, namely its miners and investors, are affected.\n\nAs the mining rewards per block halves, the supply of new coins becomes less. As a result, the price of each coin increases. The reward for miners may be less than before, but the increase in the coin's value makes up for it. Also, for miners, Bitcoin halving can lead to the consolidation of their ranks as individual miners.\n\nIf Bitcoin halving does not cause a rise in demand and value, the blockchain will reduce the mining difficulty on the network. This will make it easier for the miners to validate a block. Though block rewards are still low, the number of blocks miners can find will increase, keeping them in profit.\n\nHowever, there is a catch. Reducing block rewards makes mining difficult for individuals and small mining pools. Large corporate companies are mining Bitcoins 24/7, and competing with them can be very costly.\n\nAccording to experts, Bitcoin\u2019s mining capacity is counter-cyclical to its price. As its price increases, the total number of miners diminishes and vice versa. A 51% attack is always probable after a Bitcoin halving as many miners move out of this network.\n\nFor investors, a Bitcoin halving event is always good news. The anticipation of a halving event always increases trading activities on exchanges. Take note that the rate at which the price of Bitcoin will increase after the halving is based on several market factors.\n\nBitcoin halving value over time\n\nUpon its release, Bitcoin had a block reward of 50 Bitcoins. Its first halving occurred in 2013, and the block rewards went down to 25. In 2016, rewards fell to 12.5; after 2020, its current reward is 6.25. The next expected halving should occur in 2024, and its estimated block reward value will be 3.125 Bitcoins.\n\nThe value of Bitcoins has risen after every halving and held a price that was higher than the one before the event. Before the 2012 halving, the value of Bitcoins was around $11. Due to the halving, it rose a hundred times within a year. During the second halving of July 2016, Bitcoin\u2019s value fluctuated from around $500 to $1,000 for a few months and reached a high of $20,000 by the end of December 2017. After the May 2020 halving, Bitcoin had a bull run and climbed from $9,000 to $30,000.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin mining\n\nOne question that always bugs miners is what will happen after all the blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain are mined. Will mining come to an end?\n\nThe simple answer is no. Bitcoin is a blockchain that works on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus. Miners can validate blocks by solving critical mathematical problems and validating transactions. This removes the need for any third party to validate transactions, and miners also gain new coins in the process as rewards.\n\nThis reward is justified as miners must invest a lot of time and money in this process. Plus, there is intense competition from other miners that need to be taken into account. Miners use powerful ASIC computers that go through trillions of hashes per second to find the right hash to validate a block on the network.\n\nThe intense competition also ensures that any particular miner cannot pull off a 51% attack by gaining excessive control on a blockchain.\n\nThus, mining is a very necessary activity on a blockchain that works on the PoW mechanism. After mining all Bitcoin blocks is complete, miners will still be responsible for validating transactions. Furthermore, they will get transaction fees as their rewards. This way, miners can still act as validators of the transactions occurring on the network.\n\nThis system of reward for mining will go on at least till 2140 when the set limit of 21 million BTC is reached.\n\nIf you are currently a Bitcoin miner or thinking of mining this cryptocurrency, then Bitcoin halving will give you numerous opportunities to earn a profit. You can always hold your newly minted coins till the price appreciates and reaches a higher level. Alternatively, you can also stake them on an exchange platform to provide liquidity to other traders."

        "content": "The value of Bitcoin (BTC) is facing renewed bearish sentiments as the crypto market grapples with the uncertainty resulting from concerns around the sustainability of digital asset-friendly Silvergate bank. This situation has resulted in a keen interest in how Bitcoin price movement will react in the coming days.\n\nA crypto analyst by Twitter pseudonym StockmoneyL in a tweet on March 3, stated that the Silvergate liquidity concerns is a Bitcoin \u2018short-term sentiment killer.\u2019\n\nWith the situation putting pressure on Bitcoin\u2019s price, the analyst identified the $21,400 level as the next support position if the maiden cryptocurrency fails to overcome the $22,800 resistance.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSilvergate bank fallout\n\nThe projection comes after Bitcoin suffered a sharp fall in the wake of Silvergate, stating that it was evaluating its ability to continue with operations and that it was in the process of re-evaluating its businesses and strategies.\n\nSilvergate also noted that it faced a bank run late last year, leading to the sale of its assets at a loss, affecting its overall capitalization. The uncertainty has resulted in the possibility of an increased regulatory crackdown, considering that the lender is a member of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nInterestingly, crypto trading expert and analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe warned that the Silvergate situation mirrors the Mt.Gox hacking incident, and investors should expect further fallout from the situation.\n\n\u201cSilvergate crashes yesterday, and markets are down. Within a timespan of 12 hours, we\u2019re talking about Mt. Gox, the worse to happen with Ethereum (ETH) unlocks, Tether to collapse, Big Crisis to happen, and more. Typical crypto,\u201d he said in a tweet on March 3.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was trading at $22,339, representing daily losses of about 4%. On the weekly chart, BTC is down almost 7%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart.

        "content": "Despite its recent consolidation, the flagship digital asset Bitcoin (BTC) has been recording steady increases since the year\u2019s turn, growing over 40% as it rode on the wave of renewed optimism on the cryptocurrency market, and some experts predict the gains will continue in the future, influenced by its halving event.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin could reach $50,000 before the next halving date, which is estimated to occur in the first half of 2024, as well as to top out at an impressive $200,000 in the period after the halving, according to the observations made by the pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Trader Tardigrade on March 2.\n\nSpecifically, as per the chart shared by the crypto expert, the price of Bitcoin is placed in the area at around $50,000 in late 2023, followed by a significant surge toward about $200,000 sometime in early or mid-2025, after which another drop in price is to be expected.\n\nBitcoin price action and predictions. Source: Trader Tardigrade\n\nNotably, Bitcoin halving is a significant event in the crypto world, taking place every four years when the reward for mining new BTC blocks is cut in half. This is done to control the supply of the maiden digital asset, as there can only ever be 21 million BTC in circulation.\n\nHistorically, the halving events have led to an increase in Bitcoin price as the supply becomes more limited. The next halving is set to occur when the digital asset reaches 840,000 blocks, cutting in half the current 6.25 BTC reward for each block mined.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs things stand, the price of Bitcoin currently stands at $23,393, which represents a decline of 1.34% on its daily chart, as well as a loss of 3.12% while still recording an increase of 2.42% over the previous 30 days, as the latest data demonstrates.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart.
