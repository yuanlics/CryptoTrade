        "title": "As Kentucky's largest coal producer mines Bitcoin, its power discounts draw scrutiny \u2022 Kentucky Lantern - Kentucky Lantern",
        "content": "Union County in Western Kentucky has been the state\u2019s top coal-producer for years, mining more than 10 million tons in 2022.\n\nSomething else is being mined in Union County: Bitcoin.\n\nIn both cases, the mining is done by Alliance Resource Partners (ARP) headed by Joseph Craft III, whose wife Kelly Craft, just lost an expensive race to become the Republican nominee for governor.\n\nMining cryptocurrency requires enormous amounts of electricity to power high-capacity computers that perform complicated mathematical calculations, securing online transactions of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. These mining operations are rewarded for solving the calculations with Bitcoin itself, valued at more than $25,000 a coin as of early June.\n\nA dispute before the Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC), the state\u2019s utility regulator, will determine whether electrical utilities should have given Alliance and two Bitcoin miners in Eastern Kentucky hefty price discounts on the electricity powering their computers.\n\nUtilities give the discounts, known as economic development riders, as incentives to businesses to locate in their service territories.\n\nA group of environmental and renewable energy advocacy organizations asked the PSC last year to investigate the discounts.\n\nThey cite multiple reasons for closer scrutiny, including the strain these operations and their huge demand for power places on the grid, in exchange for relatively few jobs.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is expanding as climate experts call for the world\u2019s power generation to rapidly decarbonize amid climate change\u2019s increasing impacts. Utilities in Kentucky are trying to transition to lower-carbon-emission energy sources such as natural gas and renewables.\n\nAnother concern: The industry\u2019s volatility, as already evidenced in Kentucky. Core Scientific, which has had a crypto mining operation in West Kentucky since 2019, declared bankruptcy in December. Another mining operation that set up shop in downtown Paducah moved out abruptly due to \u201ca business decision dealing with the energy market.\u201d\n\nThe groups asking for more scrutiny \u2014 including Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, Kentucky Solar Energy Society and the Kentucky Resources Council \u2014 question whether the jobs created by crypto mining justify the discounts and whether the discounts shouldn\u2019t be saved for industries that would employ more Kentuckians.\n\nAlliance was promised more than $4 million in discounts while promising to create five jobs, although the utility doesn\u2019t have a process in place to make sure those employees weren\u2019t being double-counted from another part of Alliance\u2019s business, according to one utility employee.\n\n\u201cThis idea of utilities providing a discount to what, by appearances, looks to be a real possibility of boom, bust \u2014 or potentially bust, and then no further boom \u2014 is very concerning,\u201d said Josh Bills, a commercial energy specialist with the Mountain Association, a Berea-based economic development nonprofit and one of the interveners in the PSC case.\n\nAs he helps small businesses become more energy efficient and incorporate renewable energy, Bills also sees them struggle to pay electricity bils, so it troubles him when a \u201cboom, bust\u201d industry receives significant electricity discounts.\n\nHe said the cases before the PSC, including Alliance\u2019s Bitcoin mine, will set precedents and that it\u2019s important to get concerns about subsidies for crypto on the record.\n\nOn the other hand, an advocate for the cryptocurrency mining industry says such companies are being unfairly singled out for taking advantage of economic development incentives for which they qualify, while the utility that offered discounts to the Union County mine asserts it wasn\u2019t in error for doing so.\n\nTom Mapes, the director of energy policy for the cryptocurrency mining lobbying group Digital Chamber of Commerce, said if a cryptocurrency mining company and a utility are operating within the parameters of the laws set out for the economic development incentives, they should be able to utilize those incentives. \u201cIf we\u2019re working within the parameters of what is written out within state law or national law, why would we be judged differently?\u201d he said.\n\nMining Bitcoin on a coal mine\n\nBecause cryptocurrency mines use a lot of power, the operators are looking for the cheapest rates possible.\n\n\u201cObviously, they\u2019re going to go to where the most bang for your buck you can get in these regions, you know, the best purchasing power you have for energy or land,\u201d Mapes said. \u201cWe\u2019re running computers pretty much.\u201d\n\nCoal mining also uses a lot of electricity, and Alliance\u2019s site in Union County had some ready-made advantages, including electricity infrastructure and meters on the former coal mine site that the company planned to transfer over to use for the Bitcoin mining operation, according to emails and reports provided by Kentucky\u2019s largest utility, LG&E and KU, to the state utility regulator.\n\nAn LG&E/KU representative who visited the Bitcoin mining site in October 2022 said the initial understanding was that Alliance would put its high-powered computers in \u201cunderground mine space\u201d but that it was \u201ctoo damp and didn\u2019t have enough ventilation.\u201d\n\nKentucky Utilities, a subsidiary of LG&E and KU, offered more than $4 million in discounts over several years to Alliance\u2019s Bitcoin mining operation, a subsidiary called Bitiki-KY. Alliance promised to create five jobs and invest $25 million into the company.\n\nBitiki-KY has been running high-powered machines on a former coal mine site near Waverly in Union County since last year to mine the cryptocurrency using a constant stream of 10 megawatts of electricity, enough to power thousands of homes over the course of a year.\n\nWhether Alliance actually needed those electricity discounts as an incentive to locate at the Union County site it already owned became a central topic at a PSC hearing on May 31. Alliance did not respond to an interview request for comment about its Bitcoin mining subsidiary Bitiki-KY, which changed its legal name from Bitiki Blockchain last year.\n\nThom Cmar, a senior attorney for Earthjustice representing the environmental and renewable energy groups in the PSC case, said there normally is evidence that without such incentives, a company proposing a new facility will move elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence here that they even looked anywhere outside of Kentucky Utilities territory,\u201d Cmar said in an interview with the Lantern. \u201cThey were taking an existing site that they already owned, or that an affiliated company already owned, and just transferring it over.\u201d\n\nIn that late May hearing, Cmar asked John Bevington, director of business and economic development for LG&E and KU: Was there specific evidence that the electricity discounts were necessary to make sure Bitiki-KY didn\u2019t locate elsewhere?\n\nBevington said that he wasn\u2019t aware of evidence the coal company considered potential sites outside KU\u2019s territory and that the need to offer the discounts came over time as the utility talked with Alliance.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to try to get customers to grow and locate here without providing any incentive. But you know, occasionally it becomes a competitive environment, and the cost considerations are necessary as they were in this case,\u201d Bevington said.\n\nHe told Cmar that Alliance\u2019s previous history with the site and the existing infrastructure \u201cwas definitely attractive\u201d to the coal company.\n\nAlso during that hearing, Cmar honed in on the jobs Alliance said it would create, asking: Did the utility have evidence those five jobs were actually created?\n\nBevington, who previously worked in the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development, responded Bitiki-KY had \u201ccommitted\u201d to creating five jobs in its application for the incentives, but the utility didn\u2019t have a process in place to make sure those employees weren\u2019t being double-counted from another part of Alliance\u2019s business.\n\nIn written testimony, Bevington added that it\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d for the utility to know exactly how many jobs a company would create through electricity discounts. He said the utility also relies on cues from state officials, such as if a company receives state tax breaks, on whether to give discounts. Bitiki-KY in March 2022 received from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority (KEDFA) $250,000 in tax benefits through the Kentucky Enterprise Initiative Act.\n\nInstead of jobs being at play with these electricity discounts, Bevington said, the Bitcoin mine\u2019s electricity usage hinges on the incentives; Bitiki-KY would likely not increase its power usage from 10 MW to 13 MW without the discounts.\n\n\u201c[I]t is both facially plausible and consistent with my experience in economic development that an entity proposing to deploy $25 million of capital and create 13 MW of load might also create five jobs,\u201d Bevington said in written testimony.\n\nAn LG&E and KU spokesperson declined to answer detailed questions emailed by the Lantern about how and whether the utility verifies economic development created from electricity discounts.\n\nDoes crypto benefit the community?\n\nFor Cmar, the Earthjustice attorney, Alliance\u2019s Bitcoin mining site is a microcosm of what cryptocurrency mining companies are bringing to Kentucky.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real concern when the company comes in and says things like, \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to be creating five jobs.\u2019 But there\u2019s no evidence that has been presented that any significant amount of jobs have been created,\u201d Cmar told the Lantern.. \u201cWhy should a company like this get a discount? Shouldn\u2019t the economic development discounts be saved for other types of industries that are bringing real meaningful economic development to the area?\u201d\n\nAlliance\u2019s Bitcoin mining operation isn\u2019t the only operation moving into Kentucky and receiving electricity discounts. Two of the other PSC investigations into cryptocurrency mining involve discounts provided by Kentucky Power to operations in Pike County and Lawrence County, the latter of which would build what would likely be the state\u2019s largest such facility and have the capacity to use up to 250 megawatts of electricity. The PSC will hold hearings regarding both of those operations in July.\n\nCmar said those operations cumulatively are soaking up \u201call this extra electricity.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a time when we are working to try to transition our electric sector to cleaner forms of energy and address the imperative need to try to avoid the worst impacts of climate change by reducing emissions wherever possible, having these energy intensive \u2014 energy wasteful, really \u2014 operations coming in \u2026 has put an incredible strain on the grid.\u201d\n\nMapes, the cryptocurrency mining lobbyist, said crypto mining operations such as in Union County still provide much needed jobs to rural communities. He also said crypto mining\u2019s need for power will spur development of solar and wind generation to meet the demand.\n\nPaul Monsour, treasurer of the Union County Chamber of Commerce and a city council member in Morganfield, the county seat, recognizes that the five jobs created by Alliance will have a small impact compared to the company\u2019s coal mining in the county.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s five more jobs than we had,\u201d Monsour said. \u201cBut I would think the county would support mostly everything Alliance would want.\u201d"

        "title": "Woman scammed into converting $15K into Bitcoin sparks legal battle between crypto kiosk manager, McLennan County Sheriff\u2019s Office - KWTX",
        "content": "WACO, Texas (KWTX) - An 82-year-old Crawford woman who scammers convinced to convert $15,000 in cash into Bitcoin cryptocurrency has sparked a legal battle between the operators of the ATM-like Bitcoin machine and the McLennan County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which seized cash from the machine and returned it to the woman.\n\nLux Vending, which does business as Bitcoin Depot, alleges in its suit that the sheriff\u2019s office unlawfully seized the cash from one of its kiosk machines and returned the money to the woman without following proper due process procedures. The suit, filed in Waco\u2019s 74th State District Court, asks Judge Gary C. Coley to conduct a hearing on the dispute and to declare Bitcoin Depot the rightful owner of the seized cash.\n\nNo hearing has been set in the case.\n\n\u201cWhile the company is sympathetic to the victimized customer, as stated in the petition, the actions taken by the McLennan County Sheriff\u2019s Office are unlawful and violate Bitcoin Depot\u2019s rights under both the Texas and U.S. Constitutions,\u201d said Houston attorney John MacVane, who represents Lux Vending. \u201cBitcoin Depot looks forward to making our arguments in court and seeking the return of our property.\u201d\n\nMcLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara said despite the accusations in the lawsuit, his officers \u201cdid everything right\u201d and the Bitcoin Depot officials \u201ccan go to hell.\u201d\n\nWEB XTRA: Sheriff Parnell McNamara discusses the case and lawsuit\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of hogwash,\u201d McNamara said of the lawsuit. \u201cAs far as I am concerned, they are a bunch of vultures who want to take the money back from this person who has already been victimized. I think it is a real travesty. The money does not belong to them. It was scammed. It still belongs to the lady who put it in there. So I think it is preposterous that they have filed this lawsuit.\n\n\u201c\u2026 But it will be a cold day in hell that they get this money back from our good citizen, who has already been scammed and traumatized,\u201d he said.\n\nThe woman who reported she was scammed did not return phone messages from KWTX on Tuesday.\n\nShe reported the elaborate scam to the sheriff\u2019s office on April 27, and a detective got a search warrant from 19th State District Judge Thomas West on May 3 to seize the woman\u2019s money from the Bitcoin Depot at a Sunoco store at 7500 Bosque Blvd.\n\nAccording to the search warrant affidavit, the woman said she was online looking up cooking recipes when she received an email with a link to view a recipe. She clicked the link, which the affidavit said appears to have activated a \u201cRansomware\u201d computer virus.\n\nShe contacted \u201ccustomer support\u201d and was transferred to a \u201cfraud investigator,\u201d the affidavit states. She was told all her personal information had been compromised and that the fraud department could help her work through the problem.\n\nThe woman said she should contact her bank and law enforcement but was told it was not necessary because at that point, nothing had happened with her bank account and a \u201ccomputer virus\u201d was not something law enforcement would respond to, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe 82-year-old Crawford woman was scammed into turning $15,000 into bitcoin at a Central Texas cryptocurrency kiosk. (KWTX GRAPHIC)\n\nNext, the \u201cfraud investigator\u201d asked if she had written a check for a laptop. She said no, and the \u201cfraud investigator\u201d said a check just cleared the bank that someone wrote to pay for a laptop.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018fraud investigator\u2019 then told (the woman) he could see where a check was written to a construction company in the amount of $15,000, which had not cleared yet. (The woman) was then given instructions on how to prevent the loss of this amount of money,\u201d the affidavit states.\n\nThe woman was told to drive to her bank, make a $15,000 cash withdrawal and then go to the store at 7500 Bosque Blvd. and deposit it into the Bitcoin machine. She said she knew nothing about Bitcoin and told the man she was going to call law enforcement.\n\n\u201c(The woman) said the person on the phone stressed that essentially the longer she took to get the money out of the bank the closer the check could be to clearing,\u201d the affidavit says. \u201c(The woman) said she followed the instructions and that the guy stayed on the phone with her the entire time. (The woman) said she deposited $15,000, $100 at a time.\u201d\n\nMcNamara said, coincidentally, that when his officers arrived to serve the search warrant on the kiosk machine, the armored car company hired to service the machine pulled up to the store.\n\n\u201cWhile we were there with the search warrant, the armored car people came and we served them with the search warrant,\u201d McNamara said. \u201cWe were going to get in the machine one way or the other because we had a legal search warrant. The $15,000 she put in the machine was still in the wallet that she had put it in. So we retrieved that $15,000 and brought it back to the office. We photographed it, put it into evidence and ultimately got it back to the victim so she wouldn\u2019t be further traumatized by these creeps.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin Depot lawsuit against the sheriff\u2019s office alleges the search warrant \u201conly permitted the MCSO to seize the $15,000 \u2018for evidentiary purposes,\u2019 not for return of stolen property, forfeiture, or restitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cNotably, Bitcoin Depot was not served with the search warrant before or at the time of execution \u2013 it only received it after the seizure had already been executed,\u201d the suit alleges. \u201cOn May 3, 2023, Bitcoin Depot received the search warrant at issue from its armored car service contractor.\u201d\n\nMcLennan County District Attorney Josh Tetens, whose office advised the sheriff\u2019s office before it secured the search warrant, said he thinks the issue now is \u201cmoot\u201d since the money was returned to the woman and is no longer in possession of the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nMcNamara said the disputed issue is no different than his agency recovering stolen cars, guns or four-wheelers and returning them to their rightful owners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we possibly can, we return those stolen items to the victims, and that\u2019s what we did in this case,\u201d McNamara said.\n\nThe lawsuit contends that the owners of the Bitcoin Depot were not the scammer, they did nothing wrong and the money the woman put into their machine now belongs to them.\n\nMcNamara said he would like to say that the investigation is ongoing. However, he claims Bitcoin \u201cwill not work with any law enforcement.\u201d He said officers believe the scammer in this case is in another country.\n\nMacVane, Bitcoin Depot\u2019s attorney, disputed McNamara\u2019s claims, saying the company \u201cpledged to cooperate in any way possible\u201d to assist the investigation into \u201ccatching the bad actor and recovering the Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also immediately notified law enforcement of our policy to refund our fees on this transaction to the customer,\u201d MacVane said. \u201cUnfortunately, in response, the McLennan County Sheriff\u2019s Office seized the cash from Bitcoin Depot\u2019s machine even though Bitcoin Depot had already transferred the Bitcoin as the customer instructed.\n\n\u201cThis essentially made Bitcoin Depot suffer the entire loss despite its extensive efforts and warnings to prevent this type of fraudulent activity,\u201d he said.\n\nMacVane said in a statement that \u201cBitcoin Depot operates a nationwide network of Bitcoin ATM kiosks to provide crypto\u2010financial services and products to the community\u2014including those who have been historically underserved by traditional financial institutions.\u201d He said the company\u2019s operations are heavily regulated, and it has extensive compliance and consumer protection policies to prevent fraud and illicit activity.\n\n\u201cFor example, Bitcoin Depot\u2019s terms and conditions\u2014which all customers must agree to\u2014prohibit customers from sending Bitcoin to unknown digital wallets,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cThe company also provides numerous scam warnings at its machines in nearly every stage of a consumer transaction to prevent individuals falling victim to frauds and scams.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2023 KWTX.

The logic here is that miners' profitability is closely tied to bitcoin's price and so they step up their sales when they feel the market is strong enough to absorb extra supply. This is akin to a central bank of a current account deficit nation buying U.S. dollars in the open market when the greenback is on the offer across the board.

        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs raise unique legal issues. Here's what you need to know - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "While non-fungible tokens (NFTs) originally gained popularity on smart-contract platforms such as Ethereum and Solana, creators can now mint and transfer digital artifacts on the Bitcoin blockchain. But even though outwardly all those NFTs seem similar, the differences in how these digital assets are minted raise different intellectual property law issues \u2014 in particular, regarding the patent eligibility of applications related to NFTs.\n\nInvestors as well as NFT creators and buyers alike should be aware of these differences, to make sure they are protected by IP laws as well as beware of limitations, to decrease the likelihood of a potential infringer being able to avoid liability.\n\nDifferences between Bitcoin and smart-contract NFTs\n\nBitcoin NFTs are created in a much different way than NFTs on other blockchains. For example, NFTs can be inscribed into the Bitcoin blockchain as Ordinals. To inscribe an Ordinal, a user sends a transaction to a Taproot address and includes an asset/digital artifact such as a text or an image in the witness data section of the transaction. The witness data section can store up to 4 MB of data, which is generally large enough for most images and other digital artifacts.\n\nBut Ordinals aren\u2019t the only way to mint NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. Alternatively, users can mint NFTs using the STAMPS (Secure Tradeable Art Maintained Securely) protocol, which stores digital artifacts within the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) portion of the transaction. Proponents of the STAMPS protocol argue that because witness data can be pruned over time, Ordinals are not immutable.\n\nBy including an encoding of a digital artifact within the UTXO portion of the transaction, the digital artifact cannot be pruned from the Bitcoin blockchain. Also, instead of using the order in which a Satoshi was mined as a unique identifier for the digital artifact, the STAMPS protocol includes an asset identifier in the UTXO with the digital artifact. When the asset identifier is transferred to another user, the user takes ownership of the digital artifact.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe user also sends a Satoshi (1/100,000,000th of a Bitcoin) in the transaction, where each Satoshi is numbered in the order in which it was mined. For example, the first Satoshi ever mined is Ordinal number 1, the millionth Satoshi mined is ordinal number 1,000,000, and so on. The Satoshi (identified by its ordinal number) is then associated with the digital artifact so that the Ordinal number acts as a unique identifier on the Bitcoin blockchain for the digital artifact. Then when the user transfers the satoshi, the recipient becomes the owner of the digital artifact.\n\nBitcoin NFTs are also structured differently than other types of NFTs. For example, other types of NFTs are typically created with a unique token identifier and an associated set of properties, such as a name, a link to a digital image, etc. On the other hand, a user does not create a unique token identifier or a token at all when inscribing an Ordinal. Instead, the digital asset is inscribed with an existing Satoshi.\n\nArguably, the Satoshi does not have a unique token identifier, as it is originally mined as a fungible token which then takes on some non-fungible properties by being numbered in the order it was mined. Recently, developers have created a protocol using Ordinals for BRC-20 tokens, which is a reference to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 tokens. These BRC-20 tokens are fungible tokens created and transferred using Ordinals, thereby adding further confusion when determining the fungibility of a Satoshi used to inscribe fungible tokens.\n\nAlso, the Satoshi does not have off-chain metadata like an NFT on other blockchains, which includes a set of properties of the NFT. Instead, the digital artifact is directly inscribed into the witness data section (or the UTXO section in the STAMPS protocol) of a transaction.\n\nLegal ramifications of NFT differences\n\nPatents that only describe NFTs as they exist on smart-contract platforms (e.g., having a unique identifier and a set of properties that describes the digital artifact that they represent) may be vulnerable to a design around by a potential infringer that alters their software so that digital artifacts are minted and transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain instead of on Ethereum, Solana, or another smart contract platform. If the patent claims some use of NFTs, the potential infringer may argue that their digital artifacts on the Bitcoin blockchain are not NFTs since they may not have a unique token identifier, may not be represented by a non-fungible token, and/or do not have off-chain metadata.\n\nAccordingly, it is important to consider including a description of Bitcoin NFTs as well as smart contract platform NFTs in the patent description. For example, NFTs can be defined to include any digital artifact stored on a blockchain or referenced by a blockchain (in the case where a smart-contract platform NFT includes a link to the digital artifact) regardless of whether it is associated with a token or a unique token identifier.\n\nAddressing these legal ramifications in the patent description may also have some benefits later on when the United States Patent and Trademark Office determines whether to grant the patent. For example, U.S. patent law requires that patents claim eligible subject matter. In some instances, patent claims \u2014 particularly when they involve software \u2014 may fall under a judicial exception to patent eligibility, which can be very difficult to overcome. However, a claim is patent-eligible if the claim, for example, improves a technical field. By describing Bitcoin NFTs and their technical advantages, the legal team for NFT creators may have the proper ammunition for overcoming these eligibility concerns.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin NFTs improve upon smart contract platform NFTs by including the digital artifacts directly on the blockchain rather than including a reference or pointer to the digital artifacts. Because the Bitcoin blockchain is immutable, the digital artifacts stored on the Bitcoin blockchain are likely to remain on the blockchain forever unchanged. Bitcoin NFT owners do not have to worry about a centralized entity taking down or altering the digital artifacts so that they no longer have proof of ownership of the original. This also reduces the opportunity for fraud by selling an NFT that the seller claims to reference a particular digital artifact in a centralized storage or decentralized file storage system but does not actually reference the particular digital artifact. Instead, users can verify an inscription or STAMP on the public blockchain.\n\nExtra work, new advantages\n\nThe advent of the Bitcoin NFT may create some extra work for NFT creators and their lawyers to ensure that potential infringers aren\u2019t able to work around patents by launching their NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. However, with this extra work comes an increased likelihood of success at reaching allowance on patent applications that describe NFTs by being able to highlight the new technical advantages of Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nWhile NFT thieves may still have other ways to avoid liability for infringement, attorneys who specialize in blockchain intellectual property and patents should do their best to stay up-to-date with the latest in this rapidly developing and ever-evolving technology so that creators can enjoy the fullest protection under the law, no matter what the innovation.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The information contained in this article is for informational purposes only and is not legal advice or a substitute for obtaining legal advice from an attorney.

        "title": "Bitcoin Halvings and the Liquidity Problem - Coinbase",
        "content": "Introduction The economic relevance of bitcoin\u2019s block reward halving is often viewed positively , as the event promises to enhance bitcoin\u2019s prospective scarcity and support its supply-demand technicals. However, with only three recorded halving events in bitcoin\u2019s history, actual evidence of how markets have reacted to these milestones is still limited. Specifically, the challenge with judging the significance of these events is that it\u2019s difficult to disentangle the idiosyncratic nature of the halving from exogenous factors like global liquidity, interest rates and moves in the multilateral USD index. Previous bitcoin halving episodes occurred alongside some important historical monetary and fiscal developments, for example. In 2012, the Fed started to buy mortgage-backed securities and long-dated Treasuries as part of QE3. In 2016, Brexit may have stoked fiscal concerns in the UK and Europe and provided a catalyst for bitcoin buying. In 2020, global central banks and governments responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with unprecedented levels of stimulus, driving liquidity sharply higher. Detrending bitcoin price action from the movements in such factors helps elucidate the situation somewhat. However, outside of the third halving, evidence that these halving events supported bitcoin price action is not entirely clear cut. Moreover, global liquidity appears to have peaked in the near term, which further obfuscates what the net effect on bitcoin\u2019s price behavior might ultimately be.\n\nPeak global liquidity Lower liquidity has been observed across all asset classes in recent weeks, in part due to a 3.5% decline in global central bank balance sheet holdings over the last two months. Among the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, People\u2019s Bank of China, Bank of Japan, Bank of Canada and Bank of England, tightening conditions have reduced this broad measure of global liquidity to $29.2 trillion as of end-May. Recall that global liquidity peaked in mid-February 2022 near $33.1 trillion, contracted by $3.8 trillion through end-2022 and subsequently picked up in 1Q23. See chart 1. Cryptocurrency performance has been tracking the movements in global liquidity more closely after the deleveraging events that took place in this space during May-June 2022. In fact, the relative differential between the drain in global central bank liquidity and reduction in the crypto market cap around that time suggests that those idiosyncratic events had around a $724B impact on the asset class. At the moment, the total crypto market cap currently represents 3.6% of our broad measure of global liquidity, in line with the average year-to-date. Part of why global liquidity increased in 1Q23 was because of the drawdown in the US Treasury General Account (TGA) balance (which we\u2019ve previously discussed here ). That began around end-January after the US government breached its debt ceiling limit \u2013 forcing it to rely on the TGA to pay expenses without new debt issuance. That consequently lent support to a broad swathe of assets, crypto included. With a fiscal deal agreed in early June to resolve the debt ceiling, the question now becomes whether we could see market liquidity drained and markets suffer, as the Treasury rebuilds the TGA. To replenish its standing balance, the government will likely need to issue $700B on top of rolling over its existing debt, bringing the potential liquidity impact to a little over $1T over the next six months. In isolation, we estimate that that could potentially represent net losses of as much as 18-20% for the crypto asset class. However, the market impact ultimately depends on who absorbs the newly issued debt. If US banks buy these short-dated T-bills, for instance, that would drain bank reserves, reduce liquidity and strengthen the USD - hurting crypto as the price currency. If, on the other hand, money-market funds step in, the flow from their reverse repo facility (RRP) with the Fed to Treasuries would be characterized as liability transfers on the balance sheet that have limited bearing on the USD. Of course, the reality is that it\u2019s not likely to be an \u201ceither-or\u201d situation, and there may be other potential buyers like households and corporate treasuries that could also reduce available market liquidity by pursuing Treasuries in lieu of riskier assets. But through March to May, aggregate bank reserves with the Fed have been stable to higher despite the decline in commercial bank deposits (translating to a higher bank reserve ratio), which earn more than what they can earn in T-bill yields. We think that leaves money market funds as the biggest potential buyer here, which suggests the actual USD impact and thus the impact on cryptocurrency price behavior could be constrained.\n\nDetrending the liquidity effect If we remove the influence of global liquidity trends from bitcoin\u2019s price behavior, it reveals a compelling narrative about how bitcoin has performed within different economic regimes. Our multivariate linear regression model is based on a rolling 6-month window, fitted against daily changes in global liquidity, interest rates and the multilateral USD index. We then extract the residual between observed bitcoin spot prices and our model-fitted values to determine if there are any discernible patterns in the \u201cdetrended\u201d series. Factor analysis suggests that bitcoin unsurprisingly underperformed our model last year, with the greatest deviation having occurred in late June \u2013 amid solvency concerns for entities like Celsius, Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and Voyager. Bitcoin has since outperformed our model year-to-date, in part reflecting (1) its relative discount to its estimated fitted value as well as (2) improved supply-side technicals and (3) demand for its \u201cstore of value\u201d properties as an alternative to the points of failure witnessed in the existing financial system earlier this year. See chart 3. Looking further back, this exercise is also useful for disentangling the effect of liquidity from bitcoin\u2019s block reward halving events, which have often coincided with major episodes of central bank bond buying. Bitcoin halvings occur about every four years (or more accurately, every 210,000 blocks) as a way to manage the supply of new bitcoins in circulation, notably by halving the block reward. The next halving is expected in April or May 2024 when the block reward will be reduced from 6.25 bitcoins per block to 3.125 bitcoins per block. The first bitcoin halving occurred on November 28, 2012, which followed the Fed\u2019s implementation of QE3 (September 2012), the third round of quantitative easing. Unlike previous rounds, QE3 involved the purchase of mortgage backed securities and longer-dated Treasuries. Around the same time (August 2012), the ECB initiated its \u201cOutright Monetary Transactions\u201d program in response to the financial headwinds caused by the European debt crisis, which had been ongoing since late 2009. If we examine bitcoin behavior six months prior to and six months following the first halving compared to our model, we notice that the impact of that liquidity boost had little effect. But the model residual doesn\u2019t reflect a significant impact from the halving either, which could have been due to (1) the inefficiency of this market back then and/or (2) uncertainty over the halving\u2019s market implications. While bitcoin prices did pick up in late 2012, they only started to appreciate in earnest in early 2013 after the US debt ceiling crisis began in January that year escalating into a budget sequestration in March. At that time, we think bitcoin\u2019s price better reflected its value as a hedge against fiscal uncertainty. See chart 4. The second bitcoin halving occurred on July 9, 2016, which immediately followed the Brexit referendum (June 23, 2016) that led the Bank of England to resume its bond buying program. While that black swan event itself may not have unlocked significant liquidity, it\u2019s possible that bitcoin prices may have swelled in response to the economic upheaval and volatility that it represented. Brexit also came after the ECB\u2019s decision months earlier to extend the Expanded Asset Purchase Programme (EAPP), which had been initiated in March 2015 and scheduled to end in 2016. If we remove the effect of liquidity on bitcoin prices, our model residual does still reflect a noticeable increase during the month preceding and following the second bitcoin halving. Note that unlike the first halving, this second halving was both well-telegraphed and highly anticipated, which may have factored into the market reaction. While it\u2019s possible that bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals contributed to its strength at this time due to global events, we think it\u2019s very likely that the halving had some impact on performance by enhancing bitcoin\u2019s prospective scarcity. The third halving occurred on May 11, 2020 which followed extraordinary measures taken globally among central banks and governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In late March 2020, the Fed began large-scale and open-ended bond purchases ( QE Infinity ) to support financial market stability, while the US government enacted a fiscal stimulus package known as the CARES Act . At the same time, the ECB bought bonds as part of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (the European Union also introduced the Next Generation EU recovery plan - including a \u20ac750 billion recovery fund - but only in July 2020). Between March and early May 2020, bitcoin recovered the losses that it had incurred at the onset of the pandemic, converging to the fair value implied by our model. That was reflected in a declining net negative residual, which suggests that the retracement was due almost exclusively to the rise in liquidity at that time. Subsequently, that residual spiked two weeks prior to the third halving, which we believe suggests that this event did have a significant impact on bitcoin\u2019s price action and likely accounts for the difference between the observed vs model value."

        "title": "Why Boston financial giants are still into crypto despite rocky times - WBUR News",
        "content": "It\u2019s been a tumultuous time for cryptocurrencies. Just this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against two prominent crypto trading sites, Binance and Coinbase. In November, the second largest exchange, FTX, collapsed after allegations of fraud.\n\nInvestors lost billions of dollars when the value of their digital coins dipped after recent crypto crashes. So understandably, many investors and spectators have soured on crypto.\n\nBut cryptocurrency and its underlying technology, blockchain, still have a lot of fans in the Boston area. That includes big financial players such as Fidelity Investments and State Street Corporation, which are continuing to invest in digital assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"We believe that there's value in this technology,\" said Ramine Bigdeliazari, director of product at Fidelity Digital Assets, a Fidelity subsidiary. \"We've heard from our clients that they want access to this,\" he said, and Fidelity aims to give them a more reliable way to dip into crypto.\n\nFidelity Digital Assets Director of Product Ramine Bigdeliazari, at Fidelity's offices on Summer Street in Boston. (Robin Lubbock/WBUR)\n\nFidelity was an early investor in crypto. The company started mining the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, in 2014 \u2014 and still mines it to this day.\n\nDespite all the recent negative news about cryptocurrency, Fidelity Digital Assets last year added the option to hold and trade a second digital coin, Ether. It's the second most popular cryptocurrency.\n\n\"In order for us to understand it, we have to use it and have to be in the industry,\" Bigdeliazari said. \"We're starting to see more and more of the large participants in the existing financial markets start to do the same. I don't think you can ignore it.\"\n\nAnother large Massachusetts participant that isn't ignoring the more than $1 trillion crypto market, State Street, is also increasing its investment.\n\n\"We've actually made more investment, I think, in the last few months than we did in the first few years I was here,\" said Jay Biancamano, who leads the digital funds team at State Street.\n\nBiancamano said last year\u2019s FTX meltdown slowed some investors down. But many clients are still crypto-curious. That's why, Biancamano said, State Street is planning to increase options to invest in crypto by the end of this year.\n\nThe top of the State Street Financial Center in downtown Boston. (Jesse Costa/WBUR)\n\nBig companies like State Street are betting this type of tech will one day transform the financial industry. Biancamano envisions a future where blockchain and digital currency are part of daily life \u2014 and it's much easier to move between different types of investments.\n\nImagine walking into a Starbucks, he said, \"and you are actually able to pay for your Starbucks coffee by liquidating a portion of your Apple stock.\"\n\nUltimately, large financial firms want to offer more investments for their clients. That's how they make money. Going digital opens up a whole world of new possibilities. In addition to cryptocurrencies, there are now investments like digital art, digital real estate and new companies building on blockchain.\n\nBut working with a group of largely unregulated assets has been challenging for legacy companies, and an onslaught of investor losses and fraud has underscored the riskiness of these investments. According to a recent Pew poll, 75% of Americans who\u2019ve heard of cryptocurrency said they don\u2019t trust it.\n\nCrypto has also earned the ire of powerful skeptics, such as Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, who called this type of digital money a \"potential threat to financial stability.\"\n\nLynne Marlor, chair of the Boston Blockchain Association, said unlike new, nimble startups that have been able to \"fly under the radar,\" legacy companies can't avoid scrutiny from regulators and investors. \"These financial institutions cannot fall under the radar,\" she said.\n\nBut Marlor added the slower, more careful approach to crypto and other digital investments could be an advantage for companies like Fidelity and State Street.\n\n\"In my mind, they are the best prepared because they have taken the traditional financial markets, and they understand them,\" she said. \"Now they're taking them and creating innovative ways [of doing business].\"\n\nAfter all, she acknowledged, the \"average consumer\" still doesn't understand digital investments. Companies with long track records have earned a level of trust among the general public. They may be in a good position to help broaden the appeal of digital assets.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to include the full corporate names of both companies and to clarify that Fidelity added the option to hold and trade Ether through its digital assets subsidiary, Fidelity Digital Assets."

        "title": "As crypto burns, solo bitcoin miner wins BTC 'lottery' - Blockworks",
        "content": "Crypto has been swallowed by a sea of red, but one astronomically lucky bitcoin miner probably hasn\u2019t noticed.\n\nA solo bitcoin miner solved block 793,607 on Friday evening using what was likely a single Antminer S9 rig.\n\n\u201cA miner of this size would only solve a block [roughly] once every 450 years on average,\u201d tweeted the admin of mining software Solo CKPool.\n\nThe prosperous miner earned 6.175 BTC ($160,100), or 200 times the price of an Antminer S9 on Amazon.\n\nUnlike regular bitcoin mining pools \u2014 in which users combine computing resources to mine together while dividing profits \u2014 Solo CKPool is more of a software proxy for those who can\u2019t run Bitcoin Core directly.\n\nInstead of sharing profits with all the other miners, Solo CKPool will instead return 98% of bitcoin rewards to the miner (the other 2% going to the admin for upkeep).\n\nIt\u2019s perfect for tiny setups that might struggle to sync the entire Bitcoin blockchain (now nearly 500 GB), like this $400 rig powered by a Raspberry Pi and a USB mining stick.\n\nBut large mining operations can use Solo CKPool too, if they\u2019re feeling particularly fortunate.\n\nAbout 0.21% of Bitcoin\u2019s current hash rate (the total computing power on the network) is using the software right now.\n\nSolo bitcoin mining at all-time high difficulty\n\nBitcoin miners earn BTC by submitting the correct hash (a string of jumbled letters and numbers) for a particular block. This wins them the right to select and process transactions.\n\nMining rigs generate as many guesses as possible in the hope that one is accepted \u2014 more rigs mean more guesses and more chances at lucrative block rewards (and transaction fees).\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin to add blocks about once every 10 minutes on average. So, solving blocks must become more \u201cdifficult\u201d as more miners join the network. Otherwise, miners with loads of rigs would solve blocks in much less than 10 minutes.\n\nAnd there are loads of new mining rigs on the network, including newly-developed ASICs, more efficient than ever before. Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate has in turn set new records all year.\n\nThe network\u2019s \u201cdifficulty\u201d is also at an all-time high. This figure (now at 51.23 trillion) effectively determines the range of potentially correct hashes, making it less likely that miners would submit the correct ones without adding more machines.\n\nBitcoin mining has never been more competitive \u2014 or more \u201cdifficult\u201d\n\nAll this makes mining bitcoin with a single \u2014 or even a handful \u2014 of rigs really special. Over the past six months, data suggests only eight blocks have been solved by Solo CKPool miners, and fewer than 300 since 2014. That works out to be roughly 0.03% of all blocks mined across both periods.\n\nTwo blocks were amazingly solved across consecutive days last January, also believed to be by garage miners.\n\nAs for our recent winning solo miner, they seem content with holding their winnings. Blockchain data shows they\u2019ve sent the BTC to a fresh address, where it still sits.\n\nThe SoloCK admin estimated their luck amounted to one-in-5,500 chance. The odds of winning the US Mega Millions jackpot \u2014 most recently worth $240 million \u2014 is currently around one in 303 million.\n\nUpdated Jun. 12, 2023 at 10:22 am ET: Corrected percentage of SoloCK blocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis officially entered the United States presidential race on May 24.\n\nDuring a Twitter broadcast hosted by venture capitalist David Sacks, DeSantis pledged to lead a \u201cGreat American Comeback,\u201d provoking accusations of plagiarism from ex-president and fellow 2024 presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\nAmong topics like U.S. immigration policy and the supposed prevalence of \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d DeSantis gave significant attention to cryptocurrency during his hour-long presentation. He promised to protect \u201cthe ability to do things like Bitcoin\u201d and fight the \u201ccentral planners\u201d at Capitol Hill.\n\nRon DeSantis on #Bitcoin: \u201cI\u2019ll protect the ability to do things like bitcoin. I don\u2019t have an itch to control everything that people may be doing in this space.\u201d pic.twitter.com/j4wRHZACK5 \u2014 Jane Adams (@iLoveJaneAdams) May 25, 2023\n\nDeSantis\u2019 stance on crypto has been fairly consistent over the past few years. Still, his decision to emphasize it again is notable, as was the choice to announce his presidential bid on Twitter in the virtual presence of crypto-adjacent Elon Musk.\n\nThis has led to the characterization of DeSantis as \u201cthe choice for crypto enthusiasts in 2024,\u201d and there\u2019s little doubt the politician will keep trying to win unanimous support among the community.\n\nA friend of crypto\n\nIn 2021, the Florida governor proposed that the state government allow businesses to pay state fees with cryptocurrencies in the 2022/23 budgetary year.\n\nHe suggested providing the Florida Department of Financial Services $200,000 of financing to offer local companies the option to pay state fees via crypto, and another $500,000 to explore distributed ledger technology\u2019s potential to maintain motor vehicle records, authenticate Medicaid transactions and detect potential fraud.\n\nOverall, the governor\u2019s stance has matched general crypto enthusiasm in the state. Miami hosted the \u201clargest-ever\u201d Bitcoin event in 2021, while its mayor, Francis Suarez, started accepting his paychecks entirely in Bitcoin.\n\nMiami even introduced its own cryptocurrency, built on the Bitcoin blockchain, dubbed MiamiCoin. Within the MiamiCoin protocol, 30% of all coins mined made their way to a digital wallet designated for the city.\n\nIn 2023, DeSantis started engaging in political discussions around crypto more seriously. In March, he held a press conference under the banner \u201cBig Brother\u2019s Digital Dollar,\u201d where he spoke out against the Federal Reserve\u2019s possible plan to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Noting recent inflation rates and the Fed raising interest rates, the politician concentrated on freedom and privacy concerns tied to the \u201cdigital dollar:\u201d\n\n\u201c[A CBDC] provides the government with a direct view of all consumer activities. Any way they can get into society to exercise their agenda, they will do it. So, what the central bank digital currency is all about is surveilling Americans and controlling the behavior of Americans.\u201d\n\nConcluding the press conference, DeSantis urged Florida lawmakers and their \u201clike-minded\u201d counterparts from other states to introduce legislation prohibiting modifications to the Uniform Commercial Code so no U.S. or foreign CBDC could be included.\n\nMagazine: AI Eye: Is AI a nuke-level threat? Why AI fields all advance at once, dumb pic puns\n\nPlaying on recent tensions with China, he mentioned the country\u2019s digital yuan project, which he claimed is being used \u201cto monitor citizen behavior allowing for the surveillance of spending habits and to cut off access to goods and services.\u201d\n\nHe later repeated this rhetoric in response to the Fed\u2019s public claim that it would seek Congress\u2019s support if it decided to introduce a CBDC. DeSantis said that it is not a question of benevolent intentions but a constitutional requirement for that kind of major policy change to be authorized by Congress. \u201cUnaccountable institutions cannot impose a CBDC on Americans,\u201d he added.\n\nIt is not merely \u201cideal\u201d that major changes in policy receive specific authorization from Congress; it is constitutionally required.\n\n\n\nUnaccountable institutions cannot impose a CBDC on Americans. They will tell us that CBDC won\u2019t be abused but we are wise enough to know better.\u2026 https://t.co/OqJ27Lym2L \u2014 Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) April 10, 2023\n\nA couple of months after his fiery speech about the digital dollar, DeSantis signed a bill restricting the use of possible CBDCs in Florida. Were a U.S. CBDC to be issued, he warned, it would be \u201ca massive transfer of power from consumers to a central authority.\u201d The governor also claimed that a CBDC would threaten private cryptocurrencies.\n\nSuch a fierce anti-statist and pro-market position, complemented by decent knowledge of the crypto market, make DeSantis an attractive candidate for some industry enthusiasts. As J.W. Verret, an associate professor at George Mason Law School, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cDeSantis\u2019 leadership could cultivate a more supportive environment for cryptocurrencies, potentially stimulating a wave of innovation and entrepreneurship.\u201d\n\nHowever, the problem may lie in other areas of DeSantis\u2019 political advocacy unrelated to cryptocurrency.\n\nA foe of progressives\n\n\u201cThe most likely Trump alternative in the race,\u201d as the pundits often call him, DeSantis combines the stature of a successful governor of a large state with a conservative public persona.\n\nDuring his tenure in the U.S. Congress, DeSantis fought climate tax hikes, the Affordable Care Act, gun control, Barack Obama\u2019s immigration policy, the special prosecutor Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of interference in the 2016 presidential election and taxes on social security benefits. He was one of the founders of the conservative-libertarian congressional Freedom Caucus in 2015.\n\nAs governor, DeSantis shifted Florida\u2019s Supreme Court balance to originalism, making it more likely the court would not impede his struggle against major social change. He also imposed stricter rules on Florida universities when collaborating with China and signed an \u201canti-sanctuary city\u201d bill, preventing so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d from being established in Florida. But perhaps the most contentious of the governor\u2019s political activities is his battle with \u201ccritical race theory\u201d and LGBTQ+ awareness in schools.\n\n\u201cFlorida is where the woke goes to die,\u201d he proclaimed during his second-term speech.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, the Florida Board of Education approved a ban on teaching critical race theory in school, which DeSantis endorsed, while in December of the same year, a politician introduced his Stop Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees Act or the Stop WOKE Act.\n\nThe legislation was signed into law in 2022 but was partially injuncted by district judge Mark Walker, who declared it too vague and unconstitutional. However, DeSantis still managed to ban transgender girls from participating in female school sports competitions, and prohibited discussions on gender identity in school classrooms from kindergarten to third grade.\n\nThese efforts have been popular with conservative voters but have not come without consequences.\n\nHe eliminated Disney World\u2019s special tax district in Florida in response to the media giant\u2019s vocal opposition to his conservative stance on LGBTQ+ issues. Disney subsequently halted plans for a $1 billion development project in the state, which it claims would have created some 2,000 jobs.\n\nFurthermore, Republicans fell far short of expectations in the 2022 mid-term elections, with American voters failing to rally around the party in the numbers expected by many, and some analysts believe that the rhetoric of many party members that concentrated on culture-war issues and claims of a stolen election may have had an impact.\n\nAll this, combined with the fact that DeSantis is currently polling well behind former president Trump could spell headwinds for the pro-crypto governor.\n\nVoting in the era of polarization\n\nDeSantis represents a combination of a pro-free market, low taxes, low welfare economic vision and a populist appetite for cultural wars with progressives, which has become increasingly prevalent in the last decade.\n\nIn this context, his support for crypto is manifested more as a part of a larger anti-statist and business-friendly paradigm, rather than a detailed stance on cryptocurrency specifically \u2014 one could hardly recall any nuanced points from DeSantis about the potential of decentralized finance (DeFi), for example.\n\nThus, betting on him could widen a notable separation in the U.S. crypto community, with some feeling threatened by the Biden administration\u2019s hawkish crypto stance, in contrast to the relatively pro-crypto rhetoric in the Republican Party, leading to a growing partisan divide.\n\nIs it productive for the crypto industry to foster stronger ties with the Republican Party in the long run?\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of the Pastel Network \u2014 a decentralized blockchain for nonfungible tokens \u2014 said in an era of extreme polarization, the answer depends on where one falls on the political spectrum.\n\nThat said, the recent approach of regulation-by-enforcement from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 the head of which was appointed by a Democratic president \u2014 has been deeply unsettling for market stakeholders, up to the point of an \u201cexistential risk\u201d anxiety:\n\n\u201cSo I imagine that some in our industry would be willing to compromise on their candidate of choice, to some extent at least, because of the related policy stance on crypto. This would also apply to any number of industries, I should add, not just crypto.\u201d\n\nThe CEO and co-founder of carbon-backed digital collectibles Ecosapiens, Nihar Neelakanti, believes that the current situation is merely a projection of a general political polarization in the U.S., where the crypto industry \u2014 neutral in basics and uniting a broad spectrum of supporters, from liberals to libertarians \u2014 seeks any kind of support it can get. And DeSantis still doesn\u2019t represent the only candidate who could accumulate crypto voters.\n\nNeekalanti told Cointelegraph, \u201cThe good thing is that we now have candidates from both major parties who are supportive of Bitcoin and crypto more generally. If a pro-Bitcoin conservative wins, then there will be many who say this is bad for crypto. But if a pro-Bitcoin liberal wins, many will also say this is bad for crypto. We\u2019re just too politically divided as a nation.\u201d\n\nDan Nissanoff, the CEO and founder of Game of Silks metaverse, agrees. Speaking to Cointelegraph, he highlighted that the crypto community is still very far from uniting around any single candidate.\n\nAt least three candidates appear to have embraced the digital asset economy wholeheartedly: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy. \u201cDeSantis is popular among conservatives, just as RFK Jr. is popular among a seemingly growing number of liberals. It\u2019s nice to see glimmers of bipartisan support for digital assets.\u201d\n\nRecent: Economics of Bitcoin ATM market could hinder wider adoption\n\nThe only sure thing at this point is that Biden is likely to be the least popular candidate for crypto enthusiasts.\n\nThe optimal choice for someone in the crypto community might come down to two factors, Georgieades explained:\n\n\u201cThe first is whether any particular candidate is pro-crypto or not. And, second, how this candidate approaches other hot-button issues facing the country.\u201d"

        "title": "Regulators Have No Love for Bitcoin or Crypto: Saylor - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nI feel like we already have clarity in terms of the US regulatory regime for now. Gary Gensler at the S.E.C. seems to want to stop any crypto companies in their tracks and either have them close their businesses down completely or move offshore. How do you think how do you think it's all playing out? Well, I think MicroStrategy is view since 2020 has been that the only institutional grade investable assets in the crypto space is bitcoin. Bitcoin is the universally, globally acknowledged digital commodity in this industry. I think it's pretty clear that the regulators don't see a legitimate path forward for crypto currencies like the stable coins, crypto securities, like the tokens mentioned. They don't they don't have any love for crypto derivatives. They don't have any love for crypto tokens. And and they have a view of crypto exchanges, which is of far constrained. I mean, their view is crypto exchanges should change, which should trade and and hold a pure digital commodities like Bitcoin. And so the entire industry is kind of destined to be rationalised down to a bitcoin focused industry with maybe a half a dozen to a dozen other other proof of work tokens. So, Michael, what happens then to the exchanges in the US, at least it seems? You know, if they're only going to offer trading in Bitcoin or other, you know, clearly pure commodity tokens, that's not going to be a great business model. Do exchanges in the US just go away? I take a different point of view there. I think there's been a lot of confusion because of the 25000 other cryptos and because of of all of the crypto securities that have been angling to position himself as the next bitcoin or a better bitcoin. So now I think that the public is beginning to realize that bitcoin is the next Bitcoin. The next logical step is for bitcoin to 10x from here and then 10x again. So eventually I have confidence that the crypto exchanges will come around to realizing that Bitcoin really is the dominant asset in this space and their business models are fine. When bitcoin goes up by a factor of 10 and you know, we can see that the dominance of bitcoin and the crypto economy as measured by coin market cap has moved from 40 to 48 percent this year alone. But I think that is the stable coins and the tokens go away that long term dominance is headed for 80 percent. And I think what you got to remember is the reason that we don't have mega institutional money flowing into this space is confusion and anxiety. When that disappears, you're going to see mega amounts of money flow into space and the business models will be just fine focused on Bitcoin. Michael, I want to ask what the future of some of these centralized exchanges does look like right now, because to your point that maybe once that confusion clears up, more institutions will come in. When you have a company like Coinbase, obviously there's a big regulatory overhang right now for normal investors in the space, not the big institutions. Do you see them moving away from these sort of centralized exchanges, maybe gravitating more towards cold wallets from here? Well, you know, I I think that there is a massive need for exchanges to help people acquire Bitcoin in custody, bitcoin, especially as the pension funds, the insurance companies, the banks, the institutional investors get into the space. Companies like grayscale need to have a custodian. So. So I see a lot of bullish things for bitcoin on the horizon. I think the accounting treatment, the upcoming having the explosion and the half hour hash rate and also the clarity that has come out of the S.E.C. of late is actually laying the foundation for the next bull run. And and there is a place for crypto exchanges to help people buy bitcoins, sell bitcoin, custody, bitcoin, and. And I don't think that's going away. I think that's going to be a great business. Michael, how does MicroStrategy actually accumulate its bitcoin and has that process changed at all? We use a variety of of institutional grade bitcoin companies, we work with Coinbase and we have work with Coinbase. We have a number of institutional grade custodians as well. MicroStrategy has been kind of special in this regard because unlike, say, an ETF or the like, we're able to access the Bitcoin spot markets and hold Bitcoin. And we're also able to access the equity in the debt markets as we pursue our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. How is. I mean, you've outperformed Beto and Gray Scale and other, you know, ETF exchange traded products year to date. How how is your strategy, though, in your company different from one of these, you know, products that just hold large amounts of bitcoin? Well, we're an operating company, so we have a profitable software business and so we can sweep the cash flows of our software business into Bitcoin. Our aim is, is to allow institutional investors to get bitcoin exposure, but without charging them a fee and generating a yield when we can. And because we're able to tap the debt markets, we're able to issue debt. We're also able to refinance or pay back our debt like when we retire our silver gate loan earlier this year. We're able to issue equity when it's a creative we're able to purchase bitcoin with with cash flows when it's a creative. So those are our flexibilities you have as an operating company. If you were in FCC 40 company like an ATP or like grayscale as a trust, you can't really do those things. And I mean, the result is, you know, Bitcoin is up 55 percent this year to date. MicroStrategy is up 92 percent this year to date."

        "content": "The Bitcoin network\u2019s proof-of-work consensus mechanism could become a useful means of securing a variety of proof-of-stake (PoS) smart contract blockchain protocols, thanks to efforts from a Stanford University professor.\n\nDavid Tse and his research team are driving the use of the preeminent cryptocurrency to provide added security to PoS networks. Babylon blockchain, which Tse co-founded, aims to use Bitcoin (BTC) to bolster network security and incentivize BTC holders to participate in what is ostensibly a new approach allowing the staking of Bitcoin on proof-of-stake chains.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, Tse outlined how Babylon uses the Bitcoin scripting language to connect a PoS-based slashing mechanism to the Bitcoin network. This allows for the creation of smart contracts that can set specific spending conditions:\n\n\u201cAlthough the Bitcoin scripting language is limited in its ability to express complex spending conditions, we have used advanced cryptography to translate the slashing conditions of a PoS chain into a spendable transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.\u201d\n\nTse said that Babylon\u2019s BTC staking protocol enables BTC to secure PoS chains without altering or forking the Bitcoin blockchain. This also allows BTC holders to earn rewards for contributing to the security of PoS networks by staking their BTC.\n\n\u201cOur method essentially transforms the slashing condition of a proof-of-stake chain into a spendable Bitcoin transaction. This way, the staked BTC does not need to be bridged to the PoS chain at all.\u201d\n\nThe Stanford professor added that the simplicity of the approach also maximizes the security of blockchains by avoiding potential vulnerabilities associated with cross-chain bridges. As Cointelegraph extensively reported, cross-chain hacks and exploits have been rife, leading to over $2 billion in crypto being stolen in the past year.\n\nBitcoin remains unrivaled as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and continues to operate on the original specifications set out by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nNevertheless, the ecosystem has seen renewed interest and growth with the inception of Bitcoin Ordinals, which allow users to inscribe nonfungible tokens onto individual satoshis, the smallest denomination of a unit of BTC.\n\nSimilarly, Tse believes that protocols like Babylon expand the utility of Bitcoin beyond being a simple store of value or medium of exchange by sharing Bitcoin\u2019s robust security with other chains and applications:\n\n\u201cWe aim to scale Bitcoin\u2019s security in a way similar to Ethereum\u2019s scaling efforts, effectively sharing Bitcoin\u2019s robust security with the rest of the decentralized world.\u201d\n\nThe broader cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to develop novel approaches to blockchain consensus. Proof-of-stake chains have benefitted and are quickly adopting new approaches like zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs). StarkWare co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson, who pioneered the technology, also believes that ZK-proofs could greatly benefit the proof-of-work-based Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

        "content": "Buying a small-town soccer club with the aim to propel it into the Premier League \u2014 the world\u2019s most popular football league \u2014 is a script suitable for a Netflix series.\n\nIn fact, actor Ryan Reynold\u2019s bid to revitalize lower-league Welsh soccer team Wrexham FC has already caught the attention of Disney+ writers.\n\nIt\u2019s a quaint, quintessentially British underdog story of how an ultra-rich Hollywood actor can do something different with his wealth. However, Reynolds has no connection to Wrexham; he flies in for most games, and he\u2019s unlikely to live out the rest of his days building out the deprived historic mining town.\n\nThe story has netted mainstream media attention from the likes of the BBC, the Guardian and Sky News.\n\n\n\nIn the Bitcoin world, a similar story is unraveling. However, it\u2019s spearheaded by a local boy who\u2019s using Bitcoin not only to boost the Real Bedford Football Club but his hometown as well.\n\nMcCormack holding a trophy.\n\nIn the Bitcoin world, Peter McCormack is a familiar face, hosting the popular podcast What Bitcoin Did. According to the Guardian and the BBC, he is a blogger and \u201ccrypto guru\u201d invariably betting on Bitcoin.\n\nOver the past two years, he has strived to turn around the beleaguered Bedford FC by using Bitcoin. Real Bedford reached promotion in May, buoyed by new uniforms, new logos and, crucially, a new legion of fans.\n\nHowever, Real Bedford is also what McCormack calls the \u201cBitcoin football team.\u201d Not only does he achieve his boyhood dream of running a successful football team, but it also seeks to discretely encourage fans and onlookers to engage with the world\u2019s largest digital currency, Bitcoin.\n\nBut does the club have the legs to make it into the Premier League? And what\u2019s the point of putting the Bitcoin logo on the shirt, hosting Bitcoin meet-ups before every game, and inviting key opinion leaders of the Bitcoin world to games? And what on earth must the locals think of the \u201corange-pilled\u201d takeover?\n\nMcCormack bought Bedford FC in 2021 during the heady highs of the bull run when BTC was comfortably above $40,000 and talk of the Bitcoin price hitting six figures dominated Cointelegraph headlines. Propelled by the high Bitcoin prices, the club secured half a million dollars in sponsorship for the first year.\n\nMedia treatment\n\nDespite buying the club being a boyhood dream, most people thought McCormack was mad to take on the running of a football club with the fanbase garnered from a volatile digital currency:\n\n\u201cI think this is one of these projects whereby I don\u2019t think anyone really understood at the start. They\u2019re like, \u2018Whatever doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u2019\u201d\n\nLocal media thought McCormack was crazier still. The BBC and other British mainstream media caught wind of the story, characterizing it as the latest crypto bro to splash out on a self-indulgent purchase.\n\nJeff Booth, the author of the Bitcoin book The Price of Tomorrow, tells Magazine that even if it is a wealthy Bitcoin investor splurging on a passion, it\u2019s a non-issue \u2014 particularly becasue Bitcoin is part of the project:\n\n\u201cThrough his interests, he infects others through so other people that like football. Other people that want to follow his interests to take this to a championship, Premier League and everything else, now have an impression that they can join the ride and be part of it.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Booth explains, \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less what he wants to do. [\u2026] He\u2019s using this vehicle to be able to advance a whole bunch of other stuff, which is really cool.\u201d\n\nDespite the critical treatment in the media, two years on, McCormack and his team are still wiping down tables in the clubhouse bar, traveling to away games, hosting Bitcoin meet-ups and even washing the Real Bedford\u2019s uniforms in his home \u2014 all while the price per BTC has crashed and Bitcoin continues to take a beating in popular media. Plus, the club will sport a women\u2019s team with plans to expand into disabled and youth teams.\n\nReal Bedford commentator Will Roberts compares McCormack to a \u201cpantomime villain [\u2026] who sort of comes in and radicalizes everything, changes everything, and everyone automatically goes against it.\u201d It\u2019s only natural that it ruffles a few feathers:\n\n\u201cBut the closer you get, the more you understand what a good person he is and what a good organization he\u2019s running because it is an organization \u2014 not just a football club.\u201d\n\nBitcoin branding\n\nThe club\u2019s Bitcoin branding isn\u2019t very subtle. The strips are bright orange with the Bitcoin logo on the abdomen. The club was established during a block height as opposed to a date, and almost everything can be bought or paid for in satoshis. Why bother? Why go to great lengths to advertise a volatile digital currency that\u2019s understood by a select group of Brits?\n\nMcCormack is a marketer by profession, and Bitcoin is one of the most recognizable brands worldwide. There are now Real Bedford supporters clubs in Ghana, Tanzania and even Malaysia. The supporter base for Real Bedford rivals teams five divisions higher, and matches are live-streamed and enjoyed by Bitcoin advocates worldwide.\n\nSatoshi\u2019s name and a nod to the maximum number of Bitcoin, 21 million, on the team\u2019s kit.\n\nGandalf (not his real name), who is part of the marketing team at Bitcoin mining company Braiins, tells Magazine:\n\n\u201cIf you just bought Bedford and called it Bedford and it was just the local team, we wouldn\u2019t all be here. Like, he\u2019s been very clever about making it a Bitcoin thing, and then that gets new support and new attention into the club.\u201d\n\nA local elected councilor for the Liberal Democrats, Jake Simpson attends the last game of the season. He explains to Magazine that, thanks to the Bitcoin takeover, Bedford is gaining \u201cinternational attention, which is bringing international money. And you know, when your business and you accept cryptocurrencies, your customer base expands massively.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re attracting more people, which is why there are so many international people here already because they\u2019re interested in cryptocurrency \u2014 they\u2019re interested in Bitcoin, which is bringing them here to Bedford.\u201d\n\nBitcoin puts places on the world map \u2014 from Bitcoin Beach in El Zonte to Bitcoin Lake in Guatemala or Bitcoin Jungle in Costa Rica. In doing so, it can raise up less economically advantaged communities and regions around the world. That\u2019s the second part of the Real Bedford story, as McCormack says he wants to \u201craise up his town.\u201d\n\nWhat do the locals think?\n\nOver the course of 30 street interviews conducted in Bedford, the overarching sentiment toward Bitcoin is negative. One Christian preacher says that the surveillance element to digital currencies was unnerving \u2014 before realizing that he might be confusing CBDCs, or central bank digital currencies, and Bitcoin.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge sentiment gap between the Bitcoin believers and the Bedford locals. One Bedfordian simply says, \u201cAvoid\u201d; others call it an outright scam and that they wouldn\u2019t want to lose their money in such a scheme. Some locals have heard of the Real Bedford takeover; others knew of McCormack\u2019s story.\n\nFew locals can accurately explain what Bitcoin is or what it does \u2014 highlighting that some of the criticism could come from a position of ignorance or an unwillingness to engage with the currency frequently labeled a threat to the environment or a \u201cdark tool\u201d by mainstream media.\n\nMcCormack is aware of the negative views that cloak Bitcoin. There is no desire to \u201cforce Bitcoin\u201d onto the people of the town \u2014 it\u2019s about using the team as a Trojan horse for greater levels of Bitcoin adoption:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want people buying it and losing money and don\u2019t force it on people who come to the ground. They can see it, they can come to our meetups, but it\u2019s a soft touch.\u201d\n\nThe Real Bedford website, for example, shows a statement saying, \u201cWhy you shouldn\u2019t buy Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nReal Bedford\u2019s reasons not to buy Bitcoin.\n\nSome of the locals are converts, however. Sampson says, \u201cIt\u2019s great to see Bitcoin come into my town. [\u2026] It\u2019s massive, and it just makes me feel really proud to be from Bedford and makes me really excited, to be honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve still got to be a lot of education around it. On how, you know, my mom or my dad can go to a coffee shop and buy Bitcoin. They wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable about doing that yet. But that sort of thing happening in the town can only boost an economy in a way.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the score so far?\n\nAs opposed to bleating about Bitcoin to Bedfordians, McCormack has firmly stuck a flag in the ground and called Bitcoin advocates around the world to visit:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t talk about Bitcoin much here because Bedford\u2019s a deprived town, and I don\u2019t want people thinking, \u2018Oh my God, there\u2019s that guy who\u2019s made some money on Bitcoin.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, that hasn\u2019t stopped fans \u2014 of Bitcoin or the team \u2014 from taking Bitcoin adoption into their own hands.\n\nFrom the trunk of a car in the Real Bedford parking lot, Chris Gordon of Bitcoin payments service Bridge 2 Bitcoin shows a local Bedfordian how to accept Bitcoin. He tells Magazine:\n\n\u201cSo, it was a business owner who\u2019s interested in accepting Bitcoin payments, and it\u2019s a completely new concept to him. So, it so happens that I happen to have a point-of-sale device in the back of the car.\u201d\n\nGordon talks the local fan through the options in the hope that a \u201cfew businesses in Bedfordshire start to accept Bitcoin soon.\u201d Bitcoin is already the payment of choice in the clubhouse, and for Real Bedford merchandise \u2014 and given that paying in Bitcoin looks different from paying with Visa or cash \u2014 it can raise some eyebrows.\n\nMoreover, the mingling of both Bitcoin and soccer fans in a relaxed, pitchside environment is an opportunity for those unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency to ask questions. Matches can be long, drawn-out affairs of 0-0 draws lasting 90 minutes with a 15-minute break. Asking about the giant B on the players\u2019 shirts or the fact that the club was founded at a block height \u2014 not on a date \u2014 could pass the time.\n\nCrypto own goal?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market cap is roughly half a trillion dollars. Crypto, however, has a far greater fanbase and is worth over $1 trillion.\n\n\n\nReal Bedford, however, is a Bitcoin-only club. Its Twitter page is against fan tokens, NFTs and DAOs \u2014 the entirety of the crypto world outside Bitcoin.\n\nCommentator Roberts, who knew \u201cnothing\u201d about Bitcoin prior to working at Real Bedford, explains that the people of Bedford are \u201cgetting there.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people are made further aware of potentially the differences between not just grouping cryptocurrencies tougher \u2014 and that Bitcoin is definitely a separate entity to that.\u201d\n\nThe crypto distractions at the club are sponsors. Gemini, Casa and other crypto company logos are displayed on billboards around the stadium, which McCormack hopes to expand and renovate through Bitcoin sponsorship. Despite his devotion to Bitcoin, he\u2019s aware that taking advantage of the speculation in crypto could benefit the club:\n\n\u201cIf I did a shitcoin, I could raise a billion, and I would get this club in the Premier League in nine years because you have the money to do it. I could build a 200-million-pound stadium if I did a shitcoin. It\u2019s really tempting.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Real Bedford is a Bitcoin-only club. McCormack only holds Bitcoin and is focused on building Bedford with Bitcoin in mind. However, getting Real Bedford into the Premier League is a long-term, perhaps lifelong commitment. With the first promotion out of the way, it\u2019ll be the 2030s before Bedford has a team in the most prestigious football league.\n\n\n\nMcCormack shares a joke with Cointelegraph.\n\nMcCormack\u2019s undeterred, however. \u201cI\u2019m going to be here for the rest of my life here in Bedford at every game I can possibly be at trying to lift up my town.\u201d And the way to get this lower-league team into the Premier League?\n\n\u201cIt requires hard work, a bit of luck and for Bitcoiners to get behind it.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin rose to trade above US$26,000, recovering some of the ground it lost in the week since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against two of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges. The U.S. regulator accuses Binance.US and Coinbase of breaking securities rules. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also gained, with Binance\u2019s native token BNB leading the gains.\n\nSee related article: Crypto industry reacts to SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance\n\nCryptos rise\n\nBitcoin gained 1.00% to US$26,074 in the 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 1.32% on the week, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nEther, the world\u2019s second biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, rose 0.64% to US$1,748 in the past 24 hours. However, it is down 3.60% over the last seven days.\n\nBNB, the native token of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, climbed 5.10% to US$235, although it posted 15.11% weekly losses. The gains come after U.S. Republican Congressman Warren Davidson tweeted on Monday that he had filed a bill to restructure the SEC and remove its current chairman Gary Gensler.\n\n\u201cU.S. capital markets must be protected from a tyrannical Chairman, including the current one. That\u2019s why I am introducing legislation to fix the ongoing abuse of power and ensure protection that is in the best interest of the market for years to come,\u201d Davidson said.\n\nSEC chairman Gary Gensler reemphasized the agency\u2019s determination to strictly regulate the crypto sector in a tweeted repost of his statement made last week.\n\nThere's nothing about the crypto securities markets that suggests that investors & issuers are less deserving of the protections of our securities laws.\n\n\n\nCongress could have said in the 1930s that the securities laws applied only to stocks & bonds.\n\n\n\nFor more, read my remarks: \u2014 Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) June 12, 2023\n\nSolana, Polygon and Cardano \u2013 three of the crypto tokens named by the SEC as securities \u2013 all gained on Tuesday afternoon. However, all three have recorded losses of over 20% in the week since the SEC clampdown started.\n\nSolana gained 2.14% to US$15.42 in 24 hours, while Cardano rose 0.28% to US$0.2795. Polygon climbed 2.39% to US$0.6459.\n\n\u201cThe recent lawsuits filed by the SEC against Binance and Coinbase indicate a significant shift in regulatory approach towards the digital asset industry,\u201d Mahin Gupta, founder of Liminal, a wallet infrastructure and custody solutions platform, said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cWhile these measures may ultimately contribute to legitimizing the Web3 industry in the long run, it is important to acknowledge that such strong actions could potentially stifle innovation,\u201d Gupta added.\n\nThe increasing regulatory clampdown on cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S. is creating opportunities in the field of digital finance in Asia.\n\nIn the same week that the U.S. SEC announced it would sue Coinbase and Binance.US, stablecoin operator Circle announced that it had received a Major Payment Institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city state\u2019s central bank.\n\nSimilarly, digital assets bank Sygnum said Tuesday that MAS had granted it an in-principle approval for its Major Payment Institution Licence. The bank now plans to expand its regulated operations in Singapore, including its crypto brokerage service.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the global crypto market capitalization rose 1.17% to US$1.06 trillion, and total market volume strengthened 5.57% to US$28.83 billion.\n\nEthereum NFTs dip\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.54% to 2,964.53 in the 24 hours to 5 p.m. in Hong Kong. The index recorded losses of 9.78% over the past seven days.\n\nThe Forkast ETH NFT Composite dropped 0.99% to 1,049.57 in 24 hours, while dropping 5.42% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume on the Ethereum blockchain dropped 18.19% to US$11.86 million over the past 24 hours, according to CryptoSlam data. Bored Ape Yacht Club, the largest Ethereum-based NFT collection by sales volume, dropped 6.03% to US$1.38 million in 24 hours.\n\n\u201cThe market is struggling due to low ETH volume, lowering prices, etc. The SEC filings are really beginning to impact the market,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nDespite the negative outlook elsewhere, NFT sales volume on the Bitcoin network gained 82.66% to US$3.9 million. Sales of uncategorized Ordinals \u2014 Bitcoin NFTs that are not part of an established collection \u2014 climbed 1.15% to US$1.65 million.\n\nAsian, European equities rise; U.S. futures gain\n\nStock market display board. Image: Envato Elements\n\nAsian equity markets gained on Tuesday after China\u2019s central bank cut its seven-day reverse repurchase rate by 10 basis points to 1.9% from 2%. The move comes as the world\u2019s second biggest economy struggles to recover from three years of pandemic-induced disruptions. U.S. markets also showed gains amid hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged this week.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite gained 0.15% and the Shenzhen Component Index rose 0.76%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.60% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 strengthened 1.80%.\n\n\u201cGlobal stock markets are likely to experience a wide boost this week \u2013 not just the mega cap tech stocks \u2013 as the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to pause interest rate hikes,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of financial management firm deVere, in an emailed statement.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at its meeting on June 13 and 14. Current interest rates in the U.S. are between 5% and 5.25%, the highest level since 2006, after 10 consecutive raises starting in March last year.\n\nThe U.S. is also scheduled to release its latest consumer price index data later on Tuesday. Inflation in the world\u2019s biggest economy likely slowed to 4.1% in May, from 4.9% in April and 5% in March, according to Trading Economics.\n\nU.S. stock futures mostly rose as of 7 p.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 0.02% while S&P 500 futures rose 0.13%. Nasdaq 100 Futures also gained 0.30%.\n\nEuropean bourses traded flat on Tuesday, as investors await policy decisions from both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the U.S. Fed. The ECB is scheduled to meet on Thursday and implement another 25 basis point interest rate hike to 3.5% in an attempt to curb inflationary pressures.\n\nThe benchmark STOXX 600 rose 0.03% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 gained 0.09% during afternoon trading hours in Europe.\n\nThe eurozone reportedly slipped into recession in the first three months of 2023.\n\n\u201cHigh inflation, rising interest rates and treacherous periods of volatility have defined much of the past 12 months \u2013 all of which have made for extremely difficult trading conditions,\u201d Daniela Hathorn, Senior Market Analyst at trading platform Capital.com, said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cThe challenging market is hitting everyone at present, but one way to try and slow the tide is by diversifying your investments. It\u2019s better to spread the risk across different asset classes, companies and investments than to pursue profits from one single area that could quickly go south,\u201d Hathorn added."

        "content": "Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow 3.4% range for the past three days after successfully defending the $25,500 support on June 10. In this time, investors\u2019 attention has shifted to the macroeconomic area as the United States Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision on June 14.\n\nCryptocurrencies might work independently from the traditional finance markets, but the cost of capital impacts almost every investor. Back in May, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate to 5\u20135.25%, the highest since 2007.\n\nAll eyes will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's media speech 30 minutes after the rate announcement as markets are pricing in 94% odds of a pause at the June meeting, based on the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nCrypto fears more than just an FOMC meeting\n\nThe upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meeting isn\u2019t the only concern for the economy, as the U.S. Treasury is set to issue more than $850 billion in new bills between now and September.\n\nAdditional government debt issuance tends to cause higher yields and, thus, higher borrowing costs for companies and families. Considering the already-restrained credit market due to the recent banking crisis, odds are that gross domestic product growth will be severely compromised in the coming months.\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, miners have been selling Bitcoin (BTC) since the start of June, potentially adding further pressure to the price. Among the potential triggers are reduced earnings from a cooldown in Ordinals activity and the mining hash rate reaching an all-time high.\n\nInvestors now question whether Bitcoin will test the $25,000 resistance, a level unseen since mid-March, and for this reason, they are closely monitoring Bitcoin futures contract premiums and the costs of hedging using BTC options.\n\nBitcoin derivatives show modest improvement\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, BTC futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe demand for leveraged BTC longs has slightly increased, as the futures contract premium increased to 3% from 1.7% on June 10, although it is still far from the neutral 5% threshold.\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become more optimistic. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign of when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew.\n\nRelated: \u200b\u200bCrypto fund outflows reach $417M over 8 weeks as investor caution persists\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe 25% delta skew metric entered \u201cfear\u201d mode on June 10 as Bitcoin\u2019s price faced a 4.5% correction. Currently at 4%, the indicator displays balanced pricing between protective puts and neutral-to-bullish call options.\n\nThe crypto bear trend looks set to continue\n\nNormally, a 3% futures basis and a 6% delta skew would be considered bearish indicators, but that is not the case given the extreme amount of uncertainty regarding the economic conditions and the recent charges against Binance and Coinbase. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleges those exchanges held unregistered offerings and sales of tokens and failed to register as brokers.\n\nU.S. lawmakers have criticized the SEC for its heavy-handed approach to crypto enforcement. On June 12, Rep. Warren Davidson proposed a bill aimed at restructuring the SEC by firing Chair Gary Gensler and redistributing power between the commissioners.\n\nThe uncertain crypto regulatory environment remains a hurdle to attracting institutional investors. Furthermore, the recession risk for the U.S. economy limits the demand for risk-on assets such as Bitcoin, increasing the odds of the $25,000 support being tested.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFaced with an onslaught of regulatory enforcement actions, MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor believes the United States crypto industry is poised for a \u201cBitcoin-focused\u201d future.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, the executive chairman of the business intelligence software firm claimed that recent declarations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are \u201claying the foundation\u201d for the next Bitcoin bull run.\n\n\u201cRegulatory clarity is going to drive Bitcoin adoption by eliminating the confusion and anxiety that has been holding back institutional investors,\u201d said Saylor. Much of that confusion stems from other \u201ccrypto securities\u201d for which regulators \u201cdon\u2019t see a legitimate path forward\u201d in the United States.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey have a view of crypto exchanges which is far constrained,\u201d he added. \u201cTheir view is crypto exchanges should trade and hold pure digital commodities like Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe SEC sued Coinbase\u2014the largest crypto exchange in the US\u2014last week, alleging that the company had listed over a dozen securities on its platform without registering as a securities exchange. The agency had generally been hesitant to comment on whether a specific token classifies as security until filing a lawsuit, for which it's been criticized by the industry and Congress alike.\n\nThe SEC has ruled out Bitcoin from being a security, however, deeming it sufficiently decentralized to be called a commodity. As such, Saylor believes the regulatory crackdown on stablecoins and other tokens will likely send Bitcoin's long-term dominance back above 80% of the total crypto market.\n\n\u201cThe public is beginning to realize that Bitcoin is the next Bitcoin,\u201d said Saylor. \u201cThe next logical step is for Bitcoin to 10x from here, and then 10x again.\u201d\n\nSaylor\u2019s company is one of the world\u2019s largest holders of Bitcoin, now possessing 140,000 BTC bought at an average price of $29,803 per coin. It hasn\u2019t touched any other crypto tokens, deeming Bitcoin the \u201conly institutional grade investable asset in the crypto space.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMichael Saylor has previously argued that Ethereum (ETH)\u2014the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap\u2014is a security, due to having an ICO, pre-mine, and management team."

        "title": "Marathon Digital CEO Expects More Bitcoin Miner Deals - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nYou have a lot of crypto companies saying that they're looking overseas, that they're looking to get out of the US. What's Marathon's view? Are you looking at offshore opportunities here? Well, we recently announced a new project in the UAE where we're building one of the largest digital asset operations or mining in Abu Dhabi. We're also looking in other places. Our goal, a longer term is to be about 50 percent offshore, 50 percent onshore. Bitcoin is treated a little bit differently than broader crypto. The SCC and the CFTC have both given it clarity that Bitcoin is a commodity. It's not a security. So Bitcoin is being treated a little bit differently and I think the situation around Bitcoin is different. That being said, clearly, you know, all the way up to the top at the White House, the economic report that they issued in January had a very different tone than the one they issued prior year. So clearly this is coming from the top that crypto is bad in their views. But we're very hopeful that the legislation that is going through Congress now will hopefully add some market structure guidelines and alleviate some of the lack of clarity that exists today so that the regulators can operate in a more friendly way towards the industry that will allow people to innovate, build businesses in the US as opposed to just moving offshore. Is there any hope, Fred, in kind of fighting this crackdown from the S.E.C. in the court of public opinion? I mean, you mentioned legislation. Obviously, that's, I guess, the main mechanism through which you you would change the FTSE mandate, because so many of these coins, you can argue that they're a commodity and not a security. So I think part of the challenge is that with no clear legal rules, legislation around this, the FCC mandate is seemingly a little broader than it should be. There have been some mentions of overreach. I think there is a Republican member of the House that has put forth a bill that essentially would restructure the FCC. So I think momentum is building towards people really starting to pay attention to this at the end of the day. Congress needs to provide very clear legislation. And then I think the FCC and the CFTC have to come to terms regarding how this is all going to be regulated. But, you know, a lot of this is definitely potentially a bit of strong arming. You think about what the FCC is doing by essentially scaring people enough. They will achieve the end that they're looking for, which is to move all this off shore. You look at all these coins that have been delisted by exchanges. You look at Robinhood Hood listing all coins and stopping trading in crypto. You know, essentially the S.E.C. is achieving its end without having to take all these people were caught. So it's a matter of who gets to the finish line first and what happens come next year. You we have three presidential candidates who have come out on the Republican side that are pro bitcoin. And I think momentum, again, is building for at least a more positive environment for bitcoin in the US. But we'll have to see what Congress can do to really rein things in and get everybody aligned around how things should operate so people can get back to business. You mentioned Robin Hood. We've also seen E Toro stop new purchases of these tainted 19 coins, so to speak. Are you also avoiding any any tokens that the S.E.C. has deemed securities? Well, we're a pure Bitcoin company. So in our case, we focus on Bitcoin. It's been declared a commodity by both the SCC and the CFTC. So we're continuing just business as usual. And Fred, I'd love to get your thoughts on the mining industry. Take a step back and talk about the state of Bitcoin mining, because obviously Bitcoin had a great 20 twenty three up well over 50 percent, but still down dramatically from its peaks. What does that mean for your margins? What is your current break even rate look like and how does that compare to the rest of the industry? The industry has been going through a big upgrade cycle. There's some recent reports that have been issued that show that energy consumption is maintaining at the same level. But at the same time, the global hash rate or the amount of compute power that's applied to bitcoin mining has increased substantially. We've grown substantially. We've doubled our capacity year to date over the end of last year and will continue to grow at more throughout this year. We're using the most modern, most energy efficient machines. What we're seeing is miners that had older machines have been upgrading those to more energy efficient machines, which is making the overall industry more energy efficient. So I think people are continued to grow. Margins are essentially staying flat to a little bit lower because as global hash rate grows, the difficult. The increases, but Bitcoin prices obviously moved in the right direction this year. So I think what we're going to see is a slow uptick in the price of Bitcoin over the balance of this year leading into the having next year. At that point, there's a big impact to margins because companies cost to mine will essentially double. Right. So it'll be very interesting to see, you know, miners are very focused now on becoming more energy efficient. We have one of the most energy efficient fleets in the industry operating at somewhere around 24 jewels for terror, harsher. What's what's a hash for the average industry or the industry average, rather, is in the 40s. So I think it's going to be a bit of a period of people continue to upgrade and then there'll be some sort of cleansing post to having next year. I'm glad you brought up the having, because if we take a look forward at that, hypothetically, when we do get to that point, what would you expect the mining industry to look like? Will they? Will there be fewer miners after we get through the how long? I think what's going to happen is the larger miners that have most modern fleets, the best energy costs and are the most efficient are going to thrive. While the smaller miners that either can't raise capital, can't upgrade their machines and can't get out of generally more expensive energy contracts are either going to have to consolidate or essentially go away as well. You're seeing more miners moving offshore. There's some great stranded energy opportunities in Latin America, Asia and Africa that are coming to market at very low energy prices. And I think you're going to see this industry continue to chase the lowest cost of energy. You'll also see miners focus more on starting to own energy generation, because instead of being parasitic load on the grid, you're going to see miners move behind the meter. This is what we do. We sit behind the meter at wind farms typically. So we get to use that stranded energy and not take it off the grid. But at the same time, you're going to see miners start owning and investing in energy projects to develop their own energy, whether that's methane flare, whether that's landfill methane, whether that's solar or wind, et cetera. And I think the miners, together with the renewable energy companies, are going to be the largest investors in renewable energy projects in the US because we have a very big problem in the U.S. There is a lack of transmission capacity to shift the energy from the renewable energy farms to the consumer. And the only way you can get these projects financed is there has to be a customer for the energy and bitcoin miners make the ideal customer for that. All right. I think you're going to continue to see a lot of progress there."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s on-chain data provides evidence that Bitcoin miners are offloading their holdings. The factors influencing the selling pressure could be reduced earnings from a cooldown in Ordinals activity as well as mining difficulty and hash rate reaching an all-time high.\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, \u201cMiners have been sending a significant amount of coins to exchanges.\u201d\n\nGlassnode data shows Bitcoin (BTC) miners\u2019 inflows to exchanges spiked to a three-year high on June 3 to levels last seen during the bull market of early 2021.\n\nAcross the past week, #Bitcoin Miners have been sending a significant amount of coins to Exchanges, with the largest inflow equal to $70.8M.\n\n\n\nThis is the 3rd largest inflow on record, -$30.2M less than the peak inflow of $101M recorded during the primary bull market of 2021. pic.twitter.com/w4fNFMcxr4 \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) June 11, 2023\n\nCoin Metrics data also shows a decline in the one-hop supply metric of miners, which measures the quantity of Bitcoin stored in addresses that receive coins from mining pools.\n\nThe metric recorded a consistent uptrend in miner holdings since May 2023; however, the miners reversed their accumulation trend in the second week of June.\n\nOne-hop supply of Bitcoin miners. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nIncrease in mining difficulty and reduced Ordinals activity\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty, which refers to a measure of how difficult it is to find a new block in the Bitcoin blockchain network, reached an all-time high at the start of June.\n\nBitcoin difficulty adjusts periodically to ensure that new blocks are added to the blockchain approximately every 10 minutes on average. When the network\u2019s computation capacity increases, it readjusts to make mining more difficult and vice versa.\n\nThe difficulty is adjusted every 2,016 blocks, which is roughly every two weeks, and is based on the total computational power, or hash rate, of the network. The last adjustment occurred on May 31, with a 3.39% increase in total difficulty.\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty. Source: Blockchain.com\n\nThe increase in Bitcoin difficulty reduces the earnings of miners, eating into their profitability and possibly increasing their losses.\n\nMoreover, the competition among miners has increased since the last difficulty adjustment, with the network\u2019s hash rate rising to a new all-time high of 381 exahashes per second on June 11. The next difficulty adjustment due this week will likely add to the selling pressure.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals activity, which was responsible for an increase in miner revenue, declined in May, leading to reduced earnings for miners. The total fees paid for Ordinal inscriptions on Bitcoin dropped to a two-month low, with trading volumes on nonfungible token marketplaces showing a similar trend.\n\nThe seven-day average earnings of miners, according to Glassnode data, dropped from a high of $33.9 million in May to $25.8 million at the start of June.\n\nThe 7-day moving average of Bitcoin miner revenue (orange) and BTC's price (black). Source: Glassnode\n\nJune also marked the start of summer, with hot temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere putting a significant load on some mining farms due to the increased cost of electricity.\n\nIn 2022, the summer heat waves caused miners in Texas to temporarily shut down operations. Reportedly, Texas accounts for around 15% of the mining capacity in the United States.\n\nThe heat waves could worsen in 2023, leading to a downturn in the network\u2019s mining hash rate.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners have earned $50B from BTC block rewards, fees since 2010\n\nIdentifying miners\u2019 stress levels\n\nCurrently, the cost of producing Bitcoin for the existing mining hardware lies between $35,532 and $21,244. With Bitcoin\u2019s price holding above $25,000, the downtrend in Bitcoin\u2019s mining hash rate could be limited.\n\nHowever, if the situation worsens over the summer and the mining cost increases without a proportionate increase in the BTC price, the industry could fall back into capitulation mode, marked by accelerated BTC selling and a reduced network hash rate.\n\nBitcoin price chart with production cost indicator. Source: TradingView\n\nMoreover, while Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate has continued to rise, Bitcoin\u2019s hash price metric \u2014 the market value assigned per unit of hashing power \u2014 declined significantly in May, suggesting a cooldown in demand for mining hardware.\n\nAccording to an update from Hashrate Index, the \u201chashprice [PH] is back below $70.00/PH/day for the first time since mid-March\u201d after touching an average of $82.23 per PH per day in May, a 14.8% decline.\n\nIt remains to be seen how far the sell-off extends and whether or not Bitcoin Ordinals activity comes back in the meantime.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies To Watch: Week of June 12 - Investopedia",
        "content": "Keep an Eye on These Coins\n\nThe crypto market took a huge hit last week, largely due to the lawsuits that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed against crypto giants Binance and Coinbase. This caused the market to lose billions in market cap, and it\u2019s unclear how the events will unfold and what further impact they will have. Most coins are in the red, with a select few being only slightly affected.\n\nThis week, we examine PAX Gold (PAXG), XRP (XRP), Bitcoin (BTC), Monero (XMR), and Gnosis (GNO). In selecting these assets, we have considered several factors, including, but not limited to, positive technical developments, significant news events, and noticeable changes in price.\n\nKey Takeaways PAX Gold (PAXG) was among the least affected by recent events, with the price dropping from $1,944 to $1,924, perhaps because investors wanted the relative safety of a gold-backed cryptocurrency.\n\nXRP saw a marginal drop from $0.53 to $0.52, most likely because it is gaining the upper hand in its legal battle with the SEC.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) dropped from $26,760 to $25,959, a relatively small drop that is likely due to the fact that Bitcoin does well during rough market periods.\n\nMonero (XMR) also saw a small drop from $145.96 to $139, perhaps because it shares the same appeal to investors during market turbulence, though it relates to privacy benefits.\n\nGnosis (GNO) experienced a tiny slip from $115.30 to $110, maybe because it was protected by the fact that a new project expanded its token issuance to its network.\n\n\n\nPAX Gold (PAXG)\n\nPAX Gold (PAXG) is a cryptocurrency backed by gold and was created by those behind Paxos Standard. PAXG may be seeing less of an impact from the effects of the SEC\u2019s lawsuits because it is a token that aims to make gold easier to trade.\n\nGold is often used as a reserve asset during volatile periods, and this may be working to its benefit. PAXG is trading at around $1,924, having been priced at $1,944 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nPAXG Price: TradingView\n\nXRP (XRP)\n\nRipple Lab's XRP, is actually doing well in this volatile time because it won the motion to unseal the Hinman documents in its case against the SEC.\n\nThe documents in question contain statements made by former SEC member Bill Hinman, who stated that Ether was not a security. XRP is currently changing hands at around $0.52, having traded at $0.53 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nXRP Price: TradingView\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was one of the strongest currencies in the market this week. When investors move out of altcoins during a bearish period, they tend to put their funds into stablecoins or Bitcoin. This is possibly why the market\u2019s most popular asset saw a relatively small decline.\n\nBTC is currently priced at around $25,985, having been valued at $26,760 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nBTC Price: TradingView\n\nMonero (XMR)\n\nMonero (XMR) is similar to Bitcoin in that it has a strong community that backs it during troubling periods. Specifically, ardent crypto enthusiasts appreciate Monero\u2019s high level of privacy.\n\nThe crypto community utilizes crypto assets like XMR at a time when the market is rough, and it seems like there may be regulatory pressure. XMR is trading at around $139.00, having started last week at $145.96 (see chart below).\n\n\n\nXMR Price: TradingView\n\nGnosis (GNO)\n\nGnosis (GNO) is something of a surprise entrant on this list, given that it has not performed as well as some other tokens in recent weeks. However, it may be staving off the effects of volatility. This is due to the fact that real-world tokenization project Backed Finance announced its intention to expand its native token issuance to the Gnosis Chain.\n\nGNO is trading at around $109.80, having been priced at $115.30 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nGNO Price: TradingView\n\nAs of the date this article was written, the author does not own any of the assets discussed here.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 0.09% and S&P 500 futures rose 0.28%. Nasdaq 100 Futures also gained 0.52%.\n\nThe U.S. is scheduled to release its latest consumer price index (CPI) data on Tuesday, a key inflation indicator. Annual inflation in the world\u2019s biggest economy is expected to fall to 4.1% in May, from 4.9% in April and 5% in March, mainly due to lower energy prices, according to Trading Economics.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is expected to hold any increase in interest rates at its next meeting on June 13 and 14. Current interest rates in the U.S. are between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006, after 10 consecutive hikes that started in March 2022.\n\nEuropean bourses also strengthened on Monday. The benchmark STOXX 600 rose 0.31% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 gained 0.73%.\n\nThe European Central Bank is expected to raise its key interest rates by 25 basis points on June 15 and again in July, due to lingering inflation, according to a poll of 59 economists by Reuters.\n\n\u201cFixed income investors have experienced a period of very low interest rates over the past decade. Going forward, we are likely to see higher interest rates kept in place by central banks to control lingering inflation. In this new environment, corporate bonds can play a useful role in portfolios because different types of credit can be used at different stages of the economic cycle,\u201d Elizabeth Murphy, investment director of credit at Schroders, said in a note on Monday."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) percentage share in the crypto market has risen to nearly 50% in the aftermath of last week\u2019s altcoin market rout.\n\nOn June 13, the Bitcoin Dominance Index (BTC.D), which tracks BTC's weight against other cryptocurrencies, reached 49.29%, slightly down from its two-year highs of 49.66% seen earlier this week.\n\nBTC.D daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBTC not an \u201cunregistered security\u201d\n\nThe surge in Bitcoin dominance comes in the aftermath of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s lawsuit against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase. In the court filings, the commission accuses many leading altcoins, including Cardano\u2019s ADA (ADA) and Solana\u2019s SOL (SOL), of being \u201cunregistered securities.\u201d\n\nRelated: SEC\u2019s Gensler says BTC, ETH \u2018not securities\u2019 in a newly surfaced video\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market share typically rises during high market stress, given that traders view it as the least volatile non-stablecoin crypto asset. For instance, at the height of the banking crisis in March 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance versus altcoins also rebounded to 50%.\n\nAltcoins\u2019 7-day performance versus the U.S. dollar and Bitcoin. Source: Messari\n\nThere are also other cues suggesting Bitcoin's dominance could grow further to finally break 50%.\n\nFor instance, crypto market maker DWF Labs has reportedly sent millions of dollars worth of non-Bitcoin tokens to exchanges, potentially adding selling pressure for certain altcoins.\n\nIndependent market analyst Stack Hodler also suggested that most crypto hedge funds would first and foremost abandon their altcoin exposure.\n\nBut not everyone is bullish on BTC dominance. Fellow analyst Moustache, for example, argued that the altcoin market may have bottomed once again, with Bitcoin unable to break the 50% mark.\n\n#Bitcoin\n\n\n\nIs the USDT-Dominance about to fall?\n\n\n\nIf so, we're in for a massive Altseason.\n\n\n\n-Head and Shoulders pattern forming (W)?\n\n-Stoch RSI heavily overbought.\n\n\n\nIn the last 3 years this has led to an Altseason 4 out of 5 times.\n\n\n\n+ Sentiment is in the basement for most = Good. pic.twitter.com/odU5jg8srF \u2014 \u24d7 (@el_crypto_prof) June 12, 2023\n\nBitcoin dominance risks pullback in June\n\nChart technicals suggest that Bitcoin\u2019s dominance can indeed drop in the coming weeks as altcoins rebound.\n\nRelated: \u2018There\u2019s no more exciting time than now\u2019 for Bitcoin: BTC Prague 2023\n\nMost notably, BTC.D has failed to close decisively above the 50% mark since April 2021, often reversing its gains due to an overbought weekly relative strength index (RSI).\n\nBTC.D weekly performance chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin now faces a similar scenario with a retest of the 50% level for the first time since last summer. Meanwhile, its RSI hangs just two points below its overbought level of 70.\n\nTherefore, if history repeats, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance will decline toward 39% by late 2023 or early 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, a breakout here will be key for BTC to possibly reach levels not seen in over two years. For example, analyst Crypto Rover sees a classic bullish continuation setup, with 52% being the next major hurdle if such a scenario pans out.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Can a football team backed by Bitcoin (BTC) really raise up a town? In the latest Cointelegraph documentary, reporter Joe Hall investigates the impact of a Bitcoin football club, Real Bedford, on the small commuter town of Bedford in the United Kingdom.\n\nPeter McCormack, the renowned host of the What Bitcoin Did podcast, bought Real Bedford Football Club in 2021 during the peak of the Bitcoin bull run.\n\nWhile many questioned his decision, McCormack saw an opportunity to revive a football club and promote Bitcoin adoption in his hometown. Two years later, Real Bedford F.C. has gained promotion, secured significant sponsorships, and attracted a legion of local and international fans.\n\nAs the video demonstrates, the club\u2019s bright orange jerseys proudly display the Bitcoin logo, symbolizing its close association with the world\u2019s largest digital currency. Before each game, Bitcoin meetups are organized and influential figures from the Bitcoin world are invited to attend.\n\nNaturally, the manager\u2019s unconventional approach has sparked curiosity and criticism, with some locals skeptical of the Bitcoin branding and its implications. Hall asks locals in street interviews and pitchside conversations how much influence the club has had on the town. Some are familiar with the club\u2019s Bitcoin takeover and others had never heard of McCormack, but the overarching sentiment was negative.\n\nMcCormack, however, aims to dispel misunderstandings and facilitate greater Bitcoin adoption through the football club. Rather than forcing the currency on the town\u2019s residents, he believes in using the team as a Trojan horse to gradually introduce them to Bitcoin. The Real Bedford website even features a statement titled \u201cWhy you shouldn\u2019t buy Bitcoin,\u201d emphasizing the importance of education and responsible investment.\n\nWhile Real Bedford remains a Bitcoin-only club, McCormack acknowledges the allure of other cryptocurrencies and crypto-related projects:\n\n\u201cIf I did a shitcoin, I could raise a billion, and I would get this club in the Premier League in nine years because you have the money to do it. I could build a \u00a3200 million stadium if I did a shit coin. It\u2019s really tempting.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, McCormack is committed to Bitcoin\u2019s principles. He is convinced that through hard work and the support of the Bitcoin community, Real Bedford can reach the Premier League in the 2030s.\n\nFeaturing interviews with Jeff Booth, Ben Arc, fans and locals, The Real Bedford documentary will shed light on the team\u2019s story, showcasing the transformative power of Bitcoin in sports and local communities.\n\nAs the United Kingdom government warms up to central bank digital currencies \u2014 despite the Bitcoin community\u2019s warnings \u2014 Bitcoin could lose a foothold in the country. In such an environment, Real Bedford is increasingly a beacon for Bitcoin adoption in the United Kingdom.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin soccer club Real Bedford FC wins the league\n\nOverall, to pinch Barcelona\u2019s motto, Real Bedford is \u201cmes que un club\u201d or \u201cmore than a club.\u201d It\u2019s a symbol of resilience, rebellion and a real-world example of Bitcoin\u2019s ability to raise up areas.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

While nation-states battle against each other, Bitcoin proponents also face an uphill battle in their campaign for the adoption of decentralized financial tools:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the battle for decentralization with Bitcoin will be any different. I think there will be parallels to it; we can probably look at the reformation and the very shaky compromises which led to religious wars and civil strife.\u201d\n\nDale hopes to see Bitcoin become part of a new-age, peaceful monetary revolution, taking inspiration from the Czech Republic\u2019s fight against nazism and communism in the past.\n\n\u201cIt was a velvet revolution here in Prague that showed us just how peacefully we can throw off a seemingly entrenched and corrupt system like fiat or communism.\u201d\n\nRegulation of the cryptocurrency space has been a major talking point across Europe over the past two years, with the European Union taking steps to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework for the industry.\n\nThe Markets in Crypto-Assets bill is set to come into effect in 2024, introducing a host of requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges and ecosystem participants to use and trade cryptocurrencies on the continent.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "content": "Decentralized social media app Damus could face the axe from the Apple App Store over its Bitcoin (BTC) tipping feature.\n\nOn June 13, the creators behind Damus shared a warning letter from Apple, which stated the app would be removed from the platform because of the \u201cZaps\u201d feature allowing people to tip users and content creators in Bitcoin. The feature was made possible by integrating the Lighting Network widget to make Bitcoin payments and tips on the platform.\n\nIn its warning, Apple said the Zaps feature violates its policy prohibiting any form of tipping feature other than in-app purchases. The tech giant stated that even though the tipping feature may be optional, \u201cif they [users] are connected to or associated with receiving digital content, they must use in-app purchase in accordance with guideline 3.1.1.\u201c\n\nThe Damus team called it a watershed moment with huge implications for platforms with peer-to-peer (P2P) support. The team also clarified that Damus doesn\u2019t sell digital goods or provide features for selling digital goods. It simply has tip buttons for facilitating P2P transactions like Venmo or Cash App.\n\nDamus will be removed from the app store in 14 days, apple says zaps are not allowed on their platform because they *could* be used by content creators to sell digital content.

        "title": "Coinbase is the latest target of the SEC\u2019s crypto crackdown\u2014how U.S. investors may be affected - CNBC",
        "content": "The U.S. federal government is pursuing a case against one of the most popular cryptocurrency trading platforms. On June 6, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase, the second-largest crypto exchange by volume, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The federal regulator alleges Coinbase operated its crypto asset trading platform as an unregistered national securities exchange and broker, per the June 6 press release. The SEC also alleges at least 13 crypto assets that Coinbase made available to customers, including Solana and Cardano's tokens, qualify as \"crypto asset securities,\" according to the complaint. Coinbase's staking program, which the regulator describes as a way for crypto investors \"to earn financial returns through Coinbase's managerial efforts,\" counts as an investment contract and unregistered security, the SEC says. In a tweet following the SEC's announcement, Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong said, in part, \"Regarding the SEC complaint against us today, we're proud to represent the industry in court to finally get some clarity around crypto rules.\" \"The SEC's reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America's economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance,\" Coinbase's chief legal officer and general counsel Paul Grewal said in a statement to CNBC Make It. \"In the meantime, we'll continue to operate our business as usual.\" This comes just one day after the SEC sued Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, and its billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao. On June 5, the agency filed 13 charges against them both, which included allegations that Zhao and his exchange worked to \"secretly allow high-value U.S. customers\" to continue trading on its unregulated international exchange despite publicly claiming that U.S. customers were restricted from doing so, according to the June 5 press release. Zhao has dismissed the charges on Twitter.\n\nWhat the SEC's crackdown on crypto may mean for investors\n\n\"The harsh messaging coming from the agency and its Chair Gary Gensler is a sign the SEC may be doing exactly what many in the industry have believed: shut down crypto in the U.S.,\" Chen Arad, co-founder and chief experience officer of Solidus Labs, a company that provides tools to help crypto exchanges and institutions prevent market manipulation, tells CNBC Make It. The U.S. remains a core market for crypto firms. About 20% of Americans say they've invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, per a January NBC News poll, and around 42% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 say they've dabbled in crypto trading. Still, platforms may prefer to avoid the potential regulatory risks involved in operating here and shift their focus to countries with clearer legal requirements, Arad says. Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and author of \"Re-Architecting Trust: The Curse of History and the Crypto Cure for Money, Markets, and Platforms,\" agrees. Some crypto firms may choose limit which services they offer to U.S. customers due to the complicated regulatory framework, he tells CNBC Make It. \"That's bad for U.S. investors,\" he says. \"It means that they'll have less options and are probably going to have to pay higher fees.\" Malekan owns Coinbase stock and is a longtime Coinbase customer. There is a potential upside to the SEC's latest enforcement action against crypto exchanges. Now that the lawsuits have been filed, the platforms can respond to the allegations in an open court and the public will be able to listen in, Arad says. But don't expect crypto traders to make a mass exodus from various exchanges any time soon, Malekan says. \"The people who are going to stay away or leave already have,\" he says. \"Those who are still left and investing and using services like Coinbase are probably OK with the risks that are involved.\" Although the ongoing regulatory dynamic in the U.S. can have some effect on demand, the people who want to buy crypto will continue to find ways to do so, Arad says, and using established crypto exchanges that are regulated in the U.S. is still one of the best and safest ways.\n\nDoes the suit affect bitcoin specifically?\n\nBitcoin, one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies, wasn't named in the SEC's complaint. Bitcoin has been determined to be a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act, which means, typically, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates it, according to the agency's website. There's a general understanding within the industry that if you're just trading bitcoin, you're probably OK, Malekan says. Cryptocurrency prices briefly rose following the SEC's announcement. On June 6, bitcoin prices climbed to a little above $27,100, according to Coin Metrics. As of June 12 at 11:09am EST, bitcoin had fallen to around $25,800, per Coin Metrics.\n\nThe state of crypto platform regulation in the U.S.\n\nCurrently, one of the ways the SEC determines whether an asset is an investment contract and, therefore, a security, is through the \"Howey test.\" If an asset meets the following criteria, the agency considers it to be a security that may be subject to federal securities law: There is an investment of money; in a common enterprise; in which the investor expects a profit; and the profit is derived solely from the efforts of others. But crypto challenges a lot of these older regulatory precedents and may require a new framework, Malekan says. \"We don't regulate self-driving cars under the same rules that once applied to horse and buggies,\" he says. \"With new financial instruments, we should probably have new rules.\"\n\nTrading crypto on an exchange versus peer-to-peer"

        "title": "Bitcoin and select altcoins show resilience even as the crypto market sell-off continues - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A bearish trend formation has been pressuring cryptocurrency prices for the past eight weeks, driving the total market capitalization to its lowest level in more than two months at $1.06 trillion, a 2.4% decline between June 4 and June 11.\n\nThis time, the move wasn\u2019t driven by Bitcoin (BTC), as the leading cryptocurrency gained 0.8% during the seven-day period. The negative pressure came from a handful of altcoins that plunged over 15%, including BNB (BNB), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC) and Polkadot (DOT).\n\nTotal crypto market cap in USD, 1-day. Source: TradingView\n\nNotice that the downtrend initiated in mid-April has tested the support level in multiple instances, indicating that an eventual break to the upside would require extra effort from the bulls.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission tagged multiple altcoins as securities in separate lawsuits filed last week against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.\n\nDespite the worsening crypto regulatory environment, two derivatives metrics indicate that bulls are not yet throwing in the towel but will likely have a hard time breaking the bearish price formation to the upside.\n\nCrypto exchanges are under severe constraints in the U.S.\n\nBinance.US announced on June 9 the upcoming suspension of U.S. dollar deposits and withdrawal channels, besides delisting USD trading pairs. The exchange added that it plans to transition to a crypto-only exchange but maintains a 1:1 ratio for customer assets. The SEC issued an emergency order on June 6 to freeze the assets of Binance.US.\n\nAlso on June 9, the Crypto.com exchange announced it would no longer service institutional clients in the United States. Although the Singapore-based company alleged a lack of client demand, the curious timing matching the recent actions against Coinbase and Binance has raised suspicions, as pictured by UtilizeWeb3 founder CryptoTea.\n\nThe SEC will likely sue Crypto .com\n\n\n\nthey sued Coinbase and Binance for selling securities\n\n\n\nspecifically naming Solana, Cardano, Sandbox, Matic, CHZ, BNB, Mana, Algo and more\n\n\n\ncrypto .com also sells ALL of these cryptos\n\n\n\nplus they launched their own CRO coin\n\nplus they offer\u2026 pic.twitter.com/2nuqd5ljVY \u2014 Crypto Tea (@CryptoTea_) June 8, 2023\n\nDespite being spared from the attacks coming from the SEC, the vice-leader Ether (ETH) traded down 3.5% between June 4 and June 11 after co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated that the Ethereum network would \u201cfail\u201d if scaling doesn\u2019t go through. In a June 9 post via his personal blog, Buterin explained that the success of Ethereum depends on layer-2 scaling, wallet security and privacy-preserving features.\n\nDerivatives markets show balanced leverage demand\n\nPerpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours.\n\nA positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. Still, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.\n\nPerpetual futures accumulated 7-day funding rate on June 11. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe seven-day funding rate for BTC and ETH was neutral, indicating balanced demand from leveraged longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) using perpetual futures contracts. Curiously, BNB, SOL and ADA displayed no excessive short demand after a 15% or higher weekly price decline.\n\nTether demand in Asia shows modest resilience\n\nThe Tether (USDT) premium is a good gauge of China-based crypto retail trader demand. It measures the difference between China-based peer-to-peer trades and the United States dollar.\n\nExcessive buying demand tends to pressure the indicator above fair value at 100%, and during bearish markets, Tether\u2019s market offer is flooded, causing a 2% or higher discount.\n\nTether (USDT) peer-to-peer vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKX\n\nCurrently, the Tether premium on OKX stands at 99.8%, indicating a balanced demand from retail investors. Consequently, the indicator shows resilience considering the cryptocurrency markets dropped 17.7% over the last eight weeks to $1.06 trillion from $1.29 trillion.\n\nRelated: Democrats\u2019 \u2018war on crypto\u2019 will lose its key voters, Winklevoss twins\n\nGiven the balanced demand according to the funding rate and stablecoin markets, bulls should be more than satisfied, given that the recent regulatory FUD was unable to break the cryptocurrency market capitalization below $1 trillion.\n\nIt is unclear whether the market will be able to break from the bearish trend. Moreover, there is no apparent rationale for bulls to jump the gun and place bets on a V-shaped recovery, given the uncertainty in the regulatory environment. Ultimately, bears are in a comfortable place despite the resilience in derivatives and stablecoin metrics.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Throughout recent years, the world of crypto has been subject to as much scrutiny and volatility as it has innovation and growth.\n\nA significant component of the industry\u2019s resilience has been the community that supports the technology and its utility to transform digital finance. One of the most prominent crypto communities in the space surrounds Bitcoin (BTC), with millions of users in Reddit groups and conferences across the globe.\n\nAt the Bitcoin Prague 2023 conference, Students for Liberty CEO Wolf Von Laer spoke with Cointelegraph about the nature of the Bitcoin community and how there is a place for anyone.\n\nCointelegraph reporter Joe Hall with panelists at Bitcoin Prague 2023. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nVon Laer says the Bitcoin community might not be \u201cas welcoming,\u201d as people at events can often come off too technical or even \u201chardcore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen people walk away and say, oh, this doesn\u2019t seem like my tribe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to be more self-reflective and mature,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody wants to create a community, we need to be careful and ask do we know people that know Bitcoin? Can they explain Bitcoin well?\u201d\n\nRelated: Economics of Bitcoin ATM market could hinder wider adoption\n\nInstead, von Laer stressed how everyone has the ability to contribute to the ecosystem and that the \u201copenness of the network\u201d is reflected in the opportunities for people to join the network.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a marvelous thing to realize how everyone actually can produce value within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Anyone can make a contribution.\u201d\n\nOthers in the broader crypto industry have also spoken out on the importance of community within the space, especially in times of volatility or uncertainty.\n\nRecently the new vice president of marketing at Binance spoke with Cointelegraph saying crypto needs to \u201cdouble down\u201d on community support.\n\nDuring its fifth anniversary celebration, the team behind the EOS network used the moment to also highlight the importance of its community in light of its recent challenges.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

Cointelegraph looks at the major things to consider when it comes to Bitcoin and wider crypto market price action.\n\nBitcoin loses key trend line, but some remain bullish\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price closed the weekly candle in a disappointing position thanks to last-minute downside wiping value from crypto as a whole.\n\nThe removal of various altcoins by certain trading platforms concerned about U.S. legal ramifications sent prices tumbling, leading BTC/USD to its lowest weekly close since mid-March, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day candle chart on Bitstamp.

When you have capitulation down and folks have been drowned (forced to sell at the bottom) that sell pressure no longer manifests as we move up because \u2018there is no one left to sell,\u2019\u201d part of weekend Twitter commentary read.\n\n\u201cIf bag holders dumped at the bottom then the only sell pressure above is from short term traders/profit takers and that\u2019s not enough to stop a major impulsive move in its tracks for long.

        "content": "Bitcoin fell in Wednesday morning trading in Asia, remaining stuck under the US$26,000 resistance line. Ether also lost ground, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization were mixed. The BNB token of the Binance crypto exchange marked the biggest gains among the top 10 after a U.S. court denied the financial regulator\u2019s request to freeze the assets of the Binance.US exchange.\n\nFear & Greed\n\nBitcoin fell 0.38% over the last 24 hours to US$25,835.15 at 7:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 4.87% in the last week and repeatedly failing to break through resistance at US$26,000 following the lawsuits filed last week against U.S. crypto trading platforms by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEther dipped 0.49% to US$1,734.63, posting a 7.87%% loss for the week.\n\nBitcoin is struggling to move above $26,000 because of the fear in the crypto market and despite the optimism in equities, Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at online brokerage firm FxPro said in emailed comments.\n\n\u201cThe cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index is in the Fear territory at 45 (-2 points overnight), whereas the Fear & Greed index for the stock market is at 79 (extreme greed),\u201d Kuptsikevich noted. \u201cTechnically, to break the downtrend, Bitcoin needs to overcome $27K, and a drop below $26.5K is required to confirm the downtrend. The second scenario seems more likely.\u201d\n\nOther top 10 cryptocurrencies were mixed. Binance\u2019s BNB token led winners with 4.67% rise to US$241.36, reducing its weekly loss to 14.41%.\n\nThe BNB gains came after a U.S. federal judge on Tuesday denied the SEC request for a temporary restraining order that would have frozen the assets of Binance.US, the U.S. arm of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nThe judge\u2019s decision allows Binance.US to continue operating while it negotiates with the SEC over its compliance with securities laws. Last week, the federal agency accused Binance.US of failing to register as a securities exchange and of offering and selling unregistered securities. The SEC also filed a lawsuit against the U.S.-based Coinbase exchange. Both exchanges have rejected the allegations.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAccording to CryptoQuant, bitcoin reserves on US crypto exchanges have fallen below the 50% \u2013 levels last seen in 2017. Assets are flowing to overseas exchanges due to regulatory uncertainty and recent SEC actions against Binance and Coinbase,\u201d said Kuptsikevich.\n\nIn other developments involving the SEC and crypto, Ripple\u2019s XRP token lost 0.87% to US$0.5197 for a weekly decline of 2.25% after Tuesday\u2019s long-awaited unveiling of the so-called \u201cHinman documents,\u201d named after former SEC corporate finance director William Hinman.\n\nRipple Labs Inc. was sued by the SEC in December 2020, which alleged XRP was offered and sold as an unregistered security. The company had sought the unsealing of the documents which reveal that Hinman said Bitcoin and Ether should not be categorized as financial securities. The comments are a major point of argument between the SEC and Ripple as Ripple seeks to bolster its fair notice defense.\n\nRipple\u2019s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty wrote on Twitter Tuesday that the documents show: \u201cHinman ignored multiple warnings that his speech contained made-up analysis with no basis in law\u201d and showed the SEC flip-flopped and overstepped the boundaries of its jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cUnelected bureaucrats must faithfully apply the law within the constraints of their jurisdiction. They can\u2019t \u2013 as Hinman tried \u2013 create new law,\u201d Alderoty said.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap lost 0.12% to US$1.054 trillion in the last 24 hours, while daily trading volume increased by 10.62% to US$33.75 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT market on downtrend\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index lost 1.76% to 2,919.17 in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 10.92% for the week.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT index is now down nearly 11% in seven days as we continue to find new lows,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThinking about what it will take to recover seems pretty daunting, as traders are pretty unsure that a recovery will even mean existing assets regain value. History tells us that it\u2019s new projects that a majority of investors\u2019 funds will go into.\u201d\n\nTotal NFT buy/sell transactions rose 3.42% to US$22.1 million, but sales on Ethereum, the leading blockchain by volume, fell 3.94% over the last 24 hours to US$12.87 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nThe Bitcoin network was the second largest NFT network in terms of buy/sell transactions, jumping 76.67% to US$3.8 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nTransactions of Uncategorized Ordinals \u2014 unique digital assets on the Bitcoin network that are not identified as part of one established collection \u2014 rose 69.42% to US$1.39 million.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club sales gained 25.14% to US$1.3 million.\n\n\u201cArt is still hot, with multiple Fidenzas selling for six figures recently and plenty of hype leading up to the Sotheby\u2019s grails auctions coming this week,\u201d Petscher added. Fidenza refers to a collection of 999 NFTs created by the artist Tyler Hobbs using computer algorithms.\n\nSotheby\u2019s is auctioning the Grails digital art collection on Wednesday. The collection consists of NFT artwork that belongs to the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and its NFT-purchasing fund Starry Night Capital.\n\nU.S. stock futures mixed\n\nFederal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell (Left), Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler (Right) | Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were mixed as of 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong after equities gained for the fourth consecutive day during regular trading on Tuesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.24%, S&P 500 futures edged 0.034% lower while Nasdaq Futures gained 0.028%.\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s regular trading, the Dow climbed 0.43%. The S&P 500 added 0.69%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.83%.\n\nTuesday\u2019s U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed that inflation grew at a 4% annual rate in May, compared to 4.9% in April. The CPI was the lowest yearly inflation rate since March 2021, leaving investors hopeful for a pause in the Federal Reserve\u2019s run of interest rate hikes to curb price inflation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a feel-good headline figure that will cheer investors as it will add further pressure on the Fed to pause its interest rate hike agenda,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an email statement.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. central bank is now 15 months and 10 consecutive rate increases into its battle to cool red-hot inflation, but markets will be expecting that the latest CPI report will now be enough to convince officials to hit the pause button,\u201d Green said.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged when it meets on Wednesday, according to TradingEconomics. U.S. rates are at 5% to 5.25%, the highest since 2006 after ten consecutive hikes that started in March 2022 to slow the pace of inflation that surged to 40-year highs at one stage.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 94.2% chance the Fed will leave rates as is at this week\u2019s meeting, up from 80.4% the previous day.\n\nHowever, Green of deVere Group warned of more hikes this year \u2014 \u201cInflation is certainly coming down so far, but it is very, very gradual. It remains sticky and a long way from the 2% target, largely due to a tight labor market.\u201d\n\nFormer Fed vice chair Roger Ferguson also told CNBC last Friday that the central bank may raise rates later in the year even if it skips this time.\n\n(Updates with equities section)"

        "title": "Developer Uncle Rockstar shares the key to Bitcoin adoption: BTC Prague 2023 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "BTC Prague 2023 highlighted that there remain many places in the world where Bitcoin (BTC) adoption is still in its early stages, but the community is optimistic it can onboard more BTC supporters despite the challenges that come its way.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph reporter Joseph Hall, pseudonymous Bitcoin developer Uncle Rockstar, the head of Bitcoin at payment platform Strike, shared his thoughts on Bitcoin adoption and his most pressing concerns within the Bitcoin ecosystem in 2023.\n\nThe developer said the BTC Prague event allowed him to talk about his story. He said that while he had less time, he allowed people to catch \u201ctiny bits\u201d that he believes will let people \u201cdo the same for themselves.\u201d He explained:\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. Like, how can we have more people that individually are uplifted by Bitcoin, and then can contribute to Bitcoin? And then, we increase Bitcoin adoption.\u201d\n\nThe developer encouraged people to explore Bitcoin and reach out to him or Strike to see how they can collaborate.\n\nUncle Rockstar speaks with Cointelegraph reporter Joseph Hall at BTC Prague. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nWhen asked about his most pressing concerns in the Bitcoin ecosystem in 2023, the developer spoke about what he describes as the \u201cBitcoin derangement syndrome\u201d and distractions with \u201cshitcoins and the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission]\u201d that could cause some infighting.\n\nRelated: BTC Prague 2023: \u2018Anyone can produce value in the Bitcoin ecosystem\u2019\n\nHe further explained that community members with the so-called derangement syndrome have started to make things all about themselves. Rockstar said:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018me, me, I have done this. I have done that.\u2019 Even if you look at block size wars, it was like, \u2018I know what should be done!\u2019 And then you have a number of people who are more simply better suited and know more.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rockstar, these issues reduce the focus on what should be done within the ecosystem. The developer also said he\u2019s grateful to those who continue fighting against these bad actors within the space.\n\nHe added that everyone has a role to play in the space, and if more people join the community, Bitcoin can stay on its course.\n\n\u201cAs long as we keep getting more quality Bitcoiners in Bitcoin, and they create a network, they\u2019re all individual nodes. And they support each other, and they communicate with each other, and they collaborate. Bitcoin will keep rising,\u201d Rockstar explained.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "title": "Bitcoin Suisse's Profits Crash Amid Crypto Slump - finews.com",
        "content": "Bitcoin Suisse saw profits plunge in 2022, making it all the more urgent for the crypto start-up to restructure its business model. At the same time, it is bringing on prominent people to its board of directors as it sets the path to become an institution as finews.com found out.\n\nBitcoin Suisse\u2019s operating income fell to 37 million Swiss francs from 84 million Swiss francs in 2022 from the previous year, its CEO Dirk Klee, said in an interview with finews.com, adding that trading collapsed in the face of various scandals in the crypto industry.\n\nThe results, leaked to \u00abInside Paradeplatz,\u00bb ahead of the company\u2019s annual general meeting at the end of the month, represent a \u00abcomplete reversal\u00bb from 2021, which was a bumper year. The drop in profit-making was partially due to large individual customers selling mass amounts of tokens and coins, Klee said, while adding that overall, the company had attracted net new money.\n\nImpairment Losses\n\nThe market correction also impacted Bitcoin Suisse own holdings, deposited across trading centers worldwide, which fell by around 23 million Swiss francs. \u00abProprietary trading\u00bb category is not proprietary trading in the conventional sense, but rather corresponds to current assets used for operational business, Klee said.\n\n(Image: Bitcoin Suisse)\n\nAlthough the setback was also due to the large drops in the value of altcoins (alternative digital assets), Bitcoin Suisse will continue to maintain these holdings, Klee said. Admitting these were not \u00abpretty numbers,\u00bb for Klee they show the volatility in crypto brokerage.\n\nFurthermore, the company can stomach the results which were expected due to the market situation. Bitcoin Suisse continues to be solidly financed and \u00abvery well prepared\u00bb for a possible upturn in the crypto industry, he added.\n\nJob Cuts\n\nBitcoin Suisse has had to cut one in four jobs at the company since the end of 2021. Overall, the headcount has fallen from over 300 to around 220 full-time positions during this period. A major round of layoffs took place last January, but Klee says that some of the measures were cushioned by natural employee turnover.\n\nThe recent market turmoil that followed the lawsuits filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against leading crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase has even led to many inquiries from customers, Klee said. \u00abWe expect that the turmoil could prove positive for solid and Swiss-based providers like us,\u00bb he added.\n\nNew Members\n\nPhilipp Roesler, (pictured below) the former leader of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), who also served as a finance minister and vice chancellor under Angela Merkel, is joining Bitcoin Suisse\u2019s board of directors according to Klee.\n\n(image: Brainloop)\n\nThe crypto company is hoping to gain from Roesler's international network. The 50-year-old former politician, who lives in Zurich, has a strong affinity for crypto and is active in Switzerland\u2019s crypto scene, Klee said.\n\nMarco Menotti, worked for 15 years at UBS, before moving to the Swiss stock exchange SIX\u2019s executive board in 2018. He left SIX in mid-2022 to pursue various mandates at smaller companies.\n\n(Image: Helveteq)\n\nRoger Studer\n\nBoth Roesler and Menotti will stand for election at the annual general meeting on June 29. The Zug-based crypto broker has undoubtedly scored a coup with Roesler's candidacy on Bitcoin Suisse\u2019s board. However, Roesler\u2019s candidacy is not about gathering celebrities on the board of directors - but about helping the crypto startup on its way to becoming an institution, Klee said.\n\nFurthermore, Roger Studer (pictured above) is leaving the board after a three-year term to concentrate on various other mandates. Studer headed investment banking at Zurich-based Vontobel and led a financing round for Bitcoin Suisse as an investor in 2020, before becoming an entrepreneur.\n\nSteady Earnings\n\nBitcoin Suisse is currently preparing to apply for a Swiss banking license after withdrawing its previous application in 2021. Part of these preparations include the commissioning of a crypto-compatible core banking system and strengthening of governance and compliance, Klee told finews.com\n\nBitcoin Suisse, which has had a strong trading focus, is aiming to position itself as an asset manager going forward. A shift that could also result in more steady earnings.\n\nStaking, a service whereby the entity - in this case, Bitcoin Suisse - holds tokens and coins to validate blockchain transactions and gives customers token rewards in return, is also in focus.\n\nThe Zug-based company says it is already among the five largest providers worldwide of staking services."

        "title": "Should I Buy Bitcoin or Ethereum? - The Plaid Horse",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most well-known cryptocurrencies in the market, each with its unique features and potential for growth. As the cryptocurrency market continues to expand, investors may wonder which digital asset is the better investment. In this article, we\u2019ll compare Bitcoin and Ethereum by examining their advantages, risks, and personal considerations to help you make an informed decision and finally buy Ethereum with credit card without any stress.\n\n\n\nExplanation of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, launched in 2009. It operates on a decentralized network and uses blockchain technology to facilitate transactions. Ethereum, launched in 2015, is a blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used to power these applications and facilitate transactions within the network.\n\n\n\nBrief Overview of the Cryptocurrency Market\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has grown significantly in recent years, with thousands of digital assets available for investment. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most well-known, other cryptocurrencies offer unique features and potential for growth.\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Bitcoin\n\n\n\nBitcoin offers several advantages, including:\n\n\n\nEstablished and Widely Recognized\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has established itself as a recognizable brand and a dominant player in the market. Its widespread adoption and recognition can provide a level of stability and liquidity that can be attractive to investors.\n\n\n\nLarger Market Cap\n\nBitcoin has a larger market capitalization than Ethereum, making it a more established and stable investment option.\n\n\n\nLimited Supply\n\nBitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million coins, which can increase its value over time as demand grows.\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum\n\nEthereum offers several advantages, including:\n\n\n\nSmart Contract Functionality\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities have led to a growing number of use cases, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This functionality can drive innovation and increase the platform\u2019s value over time.\n\n\n\nFaster Transaction Times\n\nEthereum\u2019s transaction times are faster than Bitcoin\u2019s, making it a more efficient option for transactions.\n\n\n\nGrowing Ecosystem of Decentralized Applications\n\nEthereum\u2019s growing ecosystem of dApps and smart contracts can provide a level of versatility and potential for growth that can be attractive to investors.\n\nRisks and Concerns\n\n\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum come with risks and concerns, including:\n\n\n\nVolatility of the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, with prices often experiencing significant fluctuations. This volatility can lead to potential losses for investors who are not prepared to weather market downturns.\n\n\n\nRegulatory Uncertainty\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to grow, it may face increased regulatory scrutiny from governments worldwide. Changes in regulations could impact Bitcoin\u2019s and Ethereum\u2019s value and their ability to operate in certain jurisdictions.\n\n\n\nSecurity Concerns\n\nCryptocurrencies are vulnerable to security breaches and hacks, which can lead to potential losses for investors.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nWhen deciding between Bitcoin and Ethereum, personal considerations should be taken into account. Consider your investment goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions to determine which digital asset aligns with your objectives. Ultimately, the decision to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum should be based on a thorough analysis of the advantages, risks, and personal considerations involved. Remember, investing in cryptocurrencies comes with risks, and it\u2019s essential to conduct thorough research and consider multiple perspectives before making any investment decisions."

        "title": "Ordinals recursive inscriptions could unlock 3D video games on Bitcoin - The Block",
        "content": "Ordinals developers have introduced a method, called recursive inscriptions, to overcome Bitcoin's 4 MB per block size limitation that restricts the size of NFTs.\n\nPreviously, inscriptions representing tokens and NFTs on Bitcoin were independent of one another, unaware of other inscriptions. The new feature allows inscriptions to reference the content of other inscriptions using a special syntax. This was brought into the Ordinals system on June 10.\n\n\"This simple change unlocks many powerful use cases,\" said pseudonymous developer Leonidas, who's building the Ord.io marketplace for inscriptions.\n\nFocused on on-chain inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, the Ordinals protocol came to prominence earlier this year, enabling the creation of BRC-20 tokens and NFTs and causing a surge in Bitcoin transactions and fees on the network.\n\nRecursive inscriptions, however, can enhance efficiency and reduce costs. For example, instead of individually inscribing thousands of JPEG files for a profile picture (PFP) collection, developers can inscribe the collection's traits and programmatically render the images through small amounts of code in subsequent inscriptions.\n\nThe approach not only streamlines the storage of artwork on-chain but also presents the opportunity to save on transaction fees. \"The art is just stored on-chain in a much more efficient way, which could have saved over a million dollars in transaction fees in the case of Bitcoin Apes,\" said Leonidas.\n\nLeonidas points out that recursive inscriptions can also be used to inscribe functioning computer code that anyone can use. NFT project OnChainMonkey has already put code on Bitcoin that it used to create 3D art with less than 1 KB of data. Yet since this code is public, anyone can now use it.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBuilding video games on Bitcoin\n\nTaking the concept further, combining inscriptions can enable additional functionality beyond the 4 MB Bitcoin block limit. While the size of each inscription wouldn\u2019t exceed this limit, the combined inscription can.\n\nThis could lead to use cases including complex 3D video games. Each part of the game's code could be stored in different inscriptions.\n\nRight now there are already very simple games that are stored on Bitcoin and can be interacted with. Some can be played on the Ord.io marketplace.\n\nBeyond this, there could even be an internal internet within Bitcoin. This would effectively transform Ordinal marketplaces and explorers into Bitcoin web browsers, allowing users to surf the blockchain and explore its ecosystem.\n\nPlatforms such as the official Ordinals explorer and Ord.io will soon support recursive inscriptions, including any of the various potential use cases."

        "content": "Remember Mt. Gox?\n\nOriginally, it was a card-trading site called MTGOX, short for Magic The Gathering Online Exchange (there was no sense of \u201cMountain\u201d in the name at all), but the domain changed hands and purpose in the early days of cryptocurrency.\n\nOperated out of Japan by French expatriate Mark Karpel\u00e8s, Mt. Gox rapidly became the biggest online Bitcoin exchange, but imploded in 2014 when the company was forced to admit that it had lost Bitcoins worth more than $0.5 billion at the time (they\u2019d be worth more than 25 times as much today).\n\nAs we wrote back then:\n\nIn 2014, the Big Daddy of Bitcoin exchanges, Japan-based Mt. Gox, made a \u201cSo sorry, they seem to have vanished\u201d announcement about a whopping 650,000 Bitcoins, worth approximately $800 each at the time. The mystery of the missing BTCs was at first blamed on a cryptographic flaw in the Bitcoin protocol that Mt. Gox\u2019s coders hadn\u2019t defended against properly \u2013 something they really ought to have done, considering that they were sitting on half-a-billion dollars worth of other people\u2019s assets. But that story didn\u2019t wash with everyone, not least those who thought that any abuse of the flaw concerned (it\u2019s euphemistically known as transaction malleability if you would like to look it up) ought to have been visible, albeit too late, in the transaction record. Some people suspected Mt. Gox insiders of simply taking the missing Bitcoins (or some of them, anyway) for themselves. Ironically, the very sort of incautious attitude to coding that would make a transaction malleability exploit possible would probably also make it possible for rogue insiders to get away unnoticed with large-scale Bitcoin larceny. That\u2019s where the story sat throughout the second half of 2014: something bad happened, but no-one quite knew whom to blame.\n\nBut on New Year\u2019s Day 2015, as we noted in that report, Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun published a dramatic article in which it openly stated that there was \u201cstrong suspicion\u201d that most of the missing Bitcoins were ripped off from inside.\n\nThe paper suggested that although the loss of BTC 7000 could be explained by cyberattack (in other words, that crooks outside the company\u2019s network were the perpetrators), there was no evidence of cyberattack in repsect of the remaining BTC 643,000.\n\nIn short, the reporters at Yomiuri Shimbun were as good as saying, 99% of the crime was an inside job.\n\nKarpel\u00e8s, for his part, ultimately received a suspended prison sentence in Japan, but that was because he was found guilty of misrepresenting his financial position to potential investors, not because of the missing Bitcoins.\n\nNot Karpel\u00e8s\n\nIronically, perhaps, Karpeles now has what amounts to a partial exoneration on the matter of the many missing Bitcoins, with the US Department of Justice unsealing Mt. Gox-related charges against two named individuals:\n\nAlexey Bilyuchenko, 43, and Aleksandr Verner, 29, both Russian nationals, are charged with conspiring to launder approximately 647,000 bitcoins from their hack of Mt. Gox. [\u2026] Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly used their unauthorized access to Mt. Gox\u2019s server to fraudulently cause bitcoin to be transferred from Mt. Gox\u2019s wallets to bitcoin addresses controlled by Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators. From September 2011 through at least May 2014, Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly caused the theft of at least approximately 647,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox, representing the vast majority of the bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox\u2019s customers. Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly laundered the bulk of the bitcoins stolen through Mt. Gox principally through bitcoin addresses associated with accounts Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators controlled at two other online bitcoin exchanges.\n\nIn an intriguing twist, Bilyuchenko is also charged with operating one of those \u201ctwo other online Bitcoin exchanges\u201d, the notorious exchange known as BTC-e, along with a third individual named Alexander Vinnik.\n\nBTC-e ran from 2011 until July 2017, when it was busted and shut down by US law enforcment.\n\nVinnik was indicted back then by a US court on money-laundering charges, after being arrested in Greece.\n\n(Since then, Vinnik has variously been in custody in Greece; extradited to France, where he was sent to prison for money laundering; returned to Greece after his release; and then extradited to the US to face charges there.)\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s press release about these new charges, relating to a hack that now dates back more than 10 years, says simply that Bilyuchenko and Verner are \u201cRussian nationals\u201d, but not which country the two men are in right now.\n\nBut US Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey did go on the record to say:\n\nFor years, Bilyuchenko and his co-conspirators allegedly operated a digital currency exchange that enabled criminals around the world \u2013 including computer hackers, ransomware actors, narcotics rings, and corrupt public officials \u2013 to launder billions of dollars. The Department of Justice will work tirelessly to identify cyber criminals, no matter where they are. And Bilyuchenko and his co-conspirators will learn that the Department of Justice has long arms and an even longer memory for crimes that harm our communities.\n\nAs for Mt. Gox, its winding-up process is at last drawing to a close, with the final deadline for recognised corporate creditors to file verification documents recently extended until 2023-06-15, just three days from now.\n\nThough the mills of the Law grind slowly/Yet they grind exceeding small/Though with patience they stand waiting/With exactness grind they all\u2026\n\n\u2026or, at least, we can but hope they do and will.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT BTC-E (AND HOW DARK WEB CROOKS GET CAUGHT)\n\nWe talk to renowned cybersecurity author Andy Greenberg about his excellent book, Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency."

        "content": "The Web3 social network Damus has two weeks to remove Bitcoin tipping functionality from its app or it will be banished from the App Store, the company said in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nScreenshots of a message sent to Damus by Apple show that the latter raised an objection over tips in the app called \u201czaps,\u201d where users can send cryptocurrency directly to creators using the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Apple said in the message posted by Damus that the tips must use Apple\u2019s in-app purchase mechanism, which takes a 30% cut of each transaction.\n\n\u201cAlthough tips or donations may be optional, if they are connected to or associated with receiving digital content, they must use in-app purchase\u2026\u201d the company wrote to Damus.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet Tuesday, Damus said Apple had reached out to schedule a call \u201cto discuss the role of zaps in more detail.\u201d\n\nDamus will be removed from the app store in 14 days, apple says zaps are not allowed on their platform because they *could* be used by content creators to sell digital content. This is right before we\u2019re about to give our talk at the oslo freedom forum on how decentralized social\u2026 pic.twitter.com/uAK1U0UBet \u2014 Damus\u26a1\ufe0f (@damusapp) June 13, 2023\n\nSeveral crypto advocates rushed to support Damus, including Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Block (formerly Square), who tagged Tim Cook in a tweet and asked the Apple CEO to reconsider the decision.\n\n\u201cThis seems to be a misunderstanding by @apple of how this feature works and what it\u2019s for. It\u2019s a critical part of the future of the internet. It has the capacity to bring people around the world into the economy without the traditional gatekeepers,\u201d Dorsey wrote in the tweet.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nApple has been in a continuous battle with blockchain-based applications for pushing its 30% fee onto cryptocurrencies and NFTs. In October, Apple updated its iOS app rules and welcomed NFT-based apps to the App Store but also rejected calls to exempt non-fungible tokens from its fee.\n\nIn December, Coinbase said Apple was blocking its latest update to its digital wallet on iOS until the crypto exchange shared 30% of gas fees from NFT transfers or disabled the ability to send them. Coinbase caved, removing the ability for Coinbase Wallet users to send NFTs between each other.\n\nDespite the conflict with Web3 companies, Apple seemed to compromise a bit in recent dealings. In April, the National Football League partnered with video game company Mythical Games to release NFL Rivals, a game on iOS that allows users to buy, collect, and trade NFTs like digital player cards.\n\nAt the time of release, Mythical Games CEO John Linden told Fortune that the game was reviewed and supported by Apple. \u201cThey\u2019ve approved. They\u2019ve been in discussion with us,\u201d Linden said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been playing the game, they\u2019re definitely in this build.\u201d\n\nSky Mavis, the parent company of Web3 game Axie Infinity, also worked with Apple to launch the mobile game Axie Infinity: Origins, which was released last month in Latin America and Asia on the App Store.\n\nThe game uses Axie Infinity\u2019s Ethereum-based Ronin blockchain and allows players to use NFTs in the game, even if they were purchased from third-party exchanges, Decrypt reported. Still, several parts of the game\u2019s functionality, including crafting recipes, must be done on the desktop or Android versions."

        "content": "Neither Icelandic authorities nor data centres in Iceland will reveal how much energy is used to mine Bitcoin or other digital currencies in Iceland, Sn\u00e6bj\u00f6rn Gu\u00f0mundsson of nature conservation organisation N\u00e1tt\u00farugri\u00f0 told V\u00edsir. Data centres use 30% more energy in Iceland than all Icelandic homes put together, and while the percentage of this energy that goes toward Bitcoin mining is not public knowledge, it could be as high as 90%.\n\nIceland\u2019s abundance of renewable energy and cheap power has had both data centres and Bitcoin mining operations flocking to the country in recent years to set up shop. Iceland\u2019s cool climate is another benefit, as data centres produce a lot of heat that would require additional energy to cool if located in a warmer climate. Both politicians and environmental activists have questioned the benefit of Bitcoin and digital currency mining operations for the Icelandic nation as well as their impact on the environment.\n\nNew hydropower plant could be used to mine Bitcoin\n\nA 2018 report by KPMG stated that around 90% of energy used by data centres in Iceland had gone toward mining Bitcoin. In a column in V\u00edsir, Sn\u00e6bj\u00f6rn refers to a recent analysis by Bitcoin expert Jaran Mellerud, who estimates that Bitcoin mining in Iceland uses around 120 MW of power, or around 85% of the 140 MW of power used by the country\u2019s data centres in 2022. These figures have not changed much in recent years despite assertions from Iceland\u2019s National Power Company (Landsvirkjun) that they would reduce the sale of Iceland\u2019s energy to Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nSn\u00e6bj\u00f6rn is concerned that the proposed Hvammsvirkjun hydropower plant in South Iceland\u2019s \u00dej\u00f3rs\u00e1 river would be used to power further Bitcoin mining in Iceland, although the National Power Company has stated that power plants would not be built solely for the energy needs of Bitcoing mining centres.\n\nNew York-based Bitcoin mining company told the Wall Street Journal last month that they would expand their operations in Iceland in response to an impending tax on Bitcoin mining in the United States. At the same time, Icelandic energy companies have stated there is no capacity for increased digital currency mining in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is a waste of energy that should not be happening in a society like the one we live in today,\u201d Sn\u00e6bj\u00f6rn stated."

Discover SCENE\n\nThird time\u2019s the charm? For the third time since January, another solo Bitcoin miner struck digital gold, solving a block worth 6 BTC, or around $160,000.\n\nThe independent miner solved a block that generally would take several years to do using limited processing power. Identified by the tag 151XTfHBfaDqoNWGGeYobNX2YzFFWuB5YD, the miner solved the 275th block of the Bitcoin blockchain on the Solo CKPool platform.\n\nCk Pool admin Con Kolivas pointed out that it would take 450 years on average for a miner of this size to solve a Bitcoin block, beating 1:5,500 odds to do so as quickly as the minder did.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Kolivas, the miner running a modest ~17 Terahashes per second (TH/s) is likely using a single S9 Bitmain Antminer unit. The S9 model Bitmain Antminer was released in 2017\u2014the latest model, Antminer S19XP, in 2022.\n\nCongratulations to miner 151XTfHBfaDqoNWGGeYobNX2YzFFWuB5YD with only ~17TH for solving the 275th block at https://t.co/UWgBvLkDqc! That is likely a single S9 miner. A miner of this size would only solve a block once every ~450 years on average https://t.co/1vGmN03qU6 \u2014 Dr. Con Kolivas (@ckpooldev) June 9, 2023\n\nA hallmark of proof-of-work consensus algorithms, mining is the process by which blocks of transactions are added to a public blockchain\u2014like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin\u2014and verified. It\u2019s also the process by which new coins are created. Mining secures the blockchain's integrity and incentivizes network participation.\n\nThe more rigs a miner has means more chances at lucrative block rewards and transaction fees.\n\nA \"hash\" can be thought of as a problem a computer, in this case, a miner needs to solve. A miner that can process a terahash can solve one trillion of these problems in a second.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe solo miners appear to all be using the Solo CK Pool mining service. In March, another solo miner used the service to solve Bitcoin block 780,112 for a 6.25 BTC, around $148,000, at the time, reward.\n\nThe Solo CK Pool service touts itself as suitable for large mining farms, \"regular miners,\" and miners with \"old/inefficient miners that will never earn any rewards through regular mining that wish to leave it mining as a lottery.\"\n\nThe lottery has again paid off.\n\nWhile Proof-of-Work miners dedicate hardware resources to secure the network, in comparison Proof-of-Stake \u201cvalidators\u201d dedicate their cryptocurrency, leading to claims that PoS blockchains are better for the environment as they consume less energy."

People from Kenya were voting, people from Tanzania were voting, it was overwhelming.\u201d\n\nMwiine won the competition, which is when the real work began. What followed was a series of firsts for the Ugandan, who managed to secure flights, visas and arrange other logistics in just three weeks.\n\n\u201cI had to figure out a way to get from Uganda to Prague, and this is where the fun began. I had to create a pitch and a budget, I\u2019d never flown before, never been on a plane, never been in Europe.\u201d\n\nThe wider Bitcoin community also came to the party, donating sats to help fund Mwiine\u2019s travels through BTC-based crowdfunding platform Geyser Fund:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most interesting implementations of Lightning [Network] whereby people can crowdfund for you to do something. Ideally, you make a pitch to the public, and if they find that your project is worth it, they\u2019ll send you some sats.\u201d\n\nWith flights and costs checked off the list, Mwiine finally made his way to Europe for what would be his first-ever Bitcoin conference and his first-ever airport experience, which added some stress to the trip when he nearly missed a connecting flight in Dubai but for the help of a fellow Ugandan airport worker.\n\nIf all #bitcion conferences end like this, I will be fundraising to attend all of them\n\n\n\nThank you @BtcPrague - The idea alone changed my life pic.twitter.com/iX7erwgytK \u2014 Brindon\u26a1 (@BrindonMwiine) June 10, 2023\n\nAttending BTC Prague allowed Mwiine to rub shoulders with Bitcoin community members he\u2019s looked up to in recent years, including BTC proponent Michael Saylor. Perhaps more importantly, Mwiine took some valuable lessons away from his interactions and experiences at different booths at the conference:\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do back at home is create a circular economy. I\u2019ve learned a lot just by being at the booth of circular economies. What they\u2019re saying is exactly what I need. It\u2019s surreal.\u201d\n\nUganda\u2019s central bank recently welcomed cryptocurrency businesses operating in the country to participate in its regulatory sandbox. This is set to include consultation with the Blockchain Association of Uganda to help create a framework for the industry in the East African nation.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nShould a major cryptocurrency exchange operating in the U.S. stop servicing its clients due to regulatory pressures, the crypto industry will eventually find a way around, according to Blockstream CEO Adam Back.\n\n\"The system is antifragile,\" Back told Decrypt during the recent BTC Prague conference. \"Something is a problem? They'll do something else or create an economic incentive for somebody. Some other company that had a different strategy will get a large amount of users.\u201d\n\n\"It's a market and there\u2019s a demand,\" he added. \"Once an exchange shuts down or stops servicing one market, people will just move to another exchange, or move to an international exchange.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack likened the crypto market to water, noting that, \"It just flows around; there are workarounds and the market is very efficient, because there's this huge appetite to do things.\u201d\n\nLast week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched enforcement actions against Binance and Coinbase, suing both companies for allegedly operating as unregistered securities exchanges.\n\nAmid the growing pressure, Binance's US subsidiary even made the decision to suspend dollar deposits, informing customers that its banking partners were preparing to temporarily halt its fiat (USD) withdrawal channel.\n\nBitcoin traders will be fine, says Back\n\nThe Blockstream boss, however, believes that if U.S. wire transfers are restricted, Bitcoin traders will move to open bank accounts in euros or Swiss francs to start trading in a different currency.\n\n\u201cThere are some more crypto-friendly banks in Europe, in Switzerland and Gibraltar, which will even accept Tether deposits and convert between USDT and dollars or euros as a bank service,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also will typically allow you to buy and sell Bitcoin, maybe with less advanced features because they're more of a bank than an exchange.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to him, this means there are always new options, and \u201ceach problem sort of just moves things around somewhere else.\u201d\n\nBlockstream CEO Back is best known as the inventor of Hashcash, a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system used to prevent email spam that later became one of the foundational concepts behind Bitcoin mining.\n\nHe told Decrypt that Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, would probably be happy to see how the space has evolved since 2009, when the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency was launched.\n\n\u201cIt's grown a lot,\" he said. \u201cThere are different types of individuals and companies and even countries that are so effective in Bitcoin\u2013 so it now seems like it tends to surprise to the upside, as things are happening earlier than you expected.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin's Future: The Great Deception and the Real Promise - Worldline",
        "content": "This blog post follows on from my previous one Shattering the illusion: Bitcoin\u2019s limitations as a Currency.\n\nTo talk about Bitcoin\u2019s future, we have to look to the past. Flashback to 31st October 2008, at approximately 2:10 p.m. Eastern Time, (for the record, it was Halloween day) when Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym hiding a person, or team, whose identity hasn\u2019t been uncovered to this day) sent an email with the subject line \u201cBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\u201d to a mailing list of cryptographers. This mail started with the sentence \u201cI\u2019ve been working on a new electronic cash system that\u2019s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party\u201d. It then went on to provide a link to Satoshi\u2019s renowned white paper: \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash system\u201d.\n\nGiven Satoshi\u2019s email subject line, should we then consider Bitcoin as digital cash?\n\nBitcoin, contrary to its founder\u2019s statement, is definitely not cash. D.W. Birch, in his book \u201cThe Currency Cold War\u201d, provides the following reasoning:\n\n\u201cWhatever Bitcoin is, it is not cash, for the inescapable reason that cash is fungible\u2026In this context \u2013 money \u2013 it means that all tokens (bitcoins) are the same and can be substituted for one another\u2026 [which]\u2026is not true of bitcoins. They are all different. And because they are all different, their history can be tracked through the blockchain\u201d\n\nThe author refers to bitcoins and tokens while pointing out that the transactions are happening and maintained on the Bitcoin blockchain (publicly available here), and they are all different and traceable. (As a matter of fact, in another book, D.W.Birch suggests that \u201cBitcoin is better understood \u2026 as a peculiar kind of digital commodity rather than as money\u201d.)\n\nComing to physical cash, if I give you one euro (literally a physical one-euro coin), you may give another coin of one euro back to me tomorrow, and no one can tell the difference between them (and no one cares, right?). This exchange of ours remains completely anonymous, and the origin of our euro coins will remain a mystery, their origin very difficult to trace. You might argue that the same case might not apply to banknotes as they are marked with serial numbers and they might have been just withdrawn from an ATM and directly used for a transaction that finally concludes with the return of the banknotes to the bank itself. But the bare truth is that, apart from in money laundering cases, no one cares much about banknote serial numbers \u2013 moreover, there might be the case that the banknotes participate in more than one commodity transaction - thus, for the sake of our argument, the same concept is applicable.\n\nShould we then believe that Bitcoin is as anonymous as cash? According to Bitcoin.org \u201cBitcoin is designed to allow its users to send and receive payments with an acceptable level of privacy as well as any other form of money. However, Bitcoin is not anonymous and cannot offer the same level of privacy as cash.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the former IRS-Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) Special Agent Chris Janczewski , has a similar opinion \u2013 he traced Bitcoin, that had once seemed untraceable, to crack one criminal case after another\u2014 including the seizure of much of the $4.5 billion of Bitcoin stolen during the 2016 Bitfinex hack.\n\nWhile money exchange was, in fact, the intended purpose of Bitcoin as disclosed in the original white paper, this thesis has evolved over time. In 2017, a debate has erupted within the Bitcoin community over whether to prioritize its functionality as a means of payment or its characteristics as a store of value. The move to make Bitcoin more attractive to merchants and consumers did not prevail over the argument that Bitcoin should be a financial investment. The latter camp wanted Bitcoin as a store of value due to its limited supply and potential as a hedge against inflation, while the former wanted cheaper transactions and faster confirmation times. Unable to reach a consensus, the disagreement ultimately resulted in the Bitcoin hard fork of 2017 and the creation of a new cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Cash (the success of which is still a matter of ongoing discussion and debate).\n\nThere is one more point that (quite interestingly) brings Bitcoin as currency, closer to the concept of money: ownership (or wealth) distribution. According to the Bitcoin rich list (as of 26th February 2023), 9.55% of bitcoin addresses own 98.51% of all bitcoins ever mined (some of these addresses might even be owned by the same person/entity). This is an obvious (and similar to money) wealth inequality problem. But then, who said that bitcoins should be fairly distributed among its owners? Perhaps it was \u201c\u2026a monetarist desire to create fairer economies\u2026that gave rise to the advent of cryptocurrencies\u201d as Jack Parkin has written in his book \u201cMoney Code Space: Hidden Power in Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Decentralisation\u201d. Bitcoin was supposed to be distributed evenly to its contributors, to allow for equal power between its builders - this was the dream, but it hasn\u2019t worked out that way.\n\nSumming up, Bitcoin is not digitally fungible like coins, it is not as anonymous as cash and the main current usage of Bitcoin is as a speculative investment. Bitcoin, as mentioned in my previous post, has no intrinsic value and it is not backed by anything, yet there are people investing in it. There are persons or entities with enough crypto coins or tokens to cause a significant impact on its market price, the infamous Whales, either by buying or selling large amounts of it. There are much smaller ones that hold coins rather than selling them in a panic if volatility increases, commonly known as the HODLers. Bitcoin followers advise to HODL your coins despite the FUD of those outside the community. FUD means \u201cfear, uncertainty and doubt.\u201d For the curious reader, I have used some Bitcoin slang here, and I suggest following the above link, to familiarize yourself in it.\n\nBen McKenzie, one of the leading voices among crypto-sceptics out there, points out that bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) are much more:\n\n\u201c\u2026similar to unregistered, unlicensed securities; they\u2019re investments of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others\u201d\n\nIt was not supposed to be this way. Bitcoin, the first and still the most popular cryptocurrency, began its life as a techno-anarchist project to create an online version of cash, as a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from governments or central banks.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of all the turmoil created by people looking to become rich in the blink of an eye, or easily persuaded into unsafe investments, Bitcoin has, admittedly, introduced blockchain technology to the world. This is a truly ground-breaking technological innovation, that is already transforming our financial system and perhaps our society in the years to come. I could not agree more with Cornell University economics professor Eswar Prasad, author of the 2021 book \u201cThe Future of Money\u201d, when he has written in a recent New York Times article, that:\n\n\u201cThe real promise of blockchain technology, which allows for more access and transparency\u2026At this moment, we have this fantastic technology, which could lead us to a more glorious world\u201d\n\nThe opinions and ideas expressed here are my own and I would be happy to discuss them - contact me at Makis.Malioris@worldline.com"

        "title": "Does cryptocurrency have a future in the Catholic Church? - U.S. Catholic magazine",
        "content": "Some believe that the technology behind cryptocurrency has the potential to reshape not just the economy, but also the church.\n\nGiven its name, it seems only natural that cryptocurrency and the suite of other blockchain-based technologies associated with it would have an enduringly opaque, mysterious, and frequently shady reputation that stretches all the way back to its creation. In 2007, Satoshi Nakamoto\u2014a pseudonym for a software engineer (or perhaps a group of engineers) who to this day remains unidentified\u2014began work on Bitcoin, a digital currency built on a previously theorized but never-before-implemented decentralized database called the blockchain. In the decade and a half since, cryptocurrencies have exploded in popularity.\n\nIn its early days, many transactions using Bitcoin or the numerous other cryptocurrencies it spawned were centered around illicit, illegal, or otherwise questionable goods and activities, ranging from drugs to prostitution to weapons. Even as recently as 2018, a study conducted by the Review of Financial Studies found that as much as 46 percent of all Bitcoin transactions were associated with illegal activity. But today cryptocurrencies have also acquired a different but similarly shady connotation, becoming heavily associated with get-rich-quick speculation, massive boom-and-bust cycles, and outright fraud and Ponzi schemes.\n\nDespite this, there are many who still see cryptocurrency and other blockchain technologies as vital innovations poised to reinvent and revitalize the structure of economies, societies, and\u2014for some\u2014even the church.\n\nMatthew Pinto, the founder and former owner of Ascension Press, is one such person. In November 2022, he assembled the first Catholic/Crypto Conference, bringing together technologists, enthusiasts, and other interested Catholics for a dialogue on the ways the church might make use of and perhaps even be changed by this nascent technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who believe that [this technology] has the ability to touch all aspects of life, that this could really be important,\u201d Pinto says of his reason for organizing the conference. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with it, but we want the church there.\u201d\n\nBrantly Millegan, one of the keynote speakers at the Catholic/Crypto Conference and a director of the Ethereum Name Service, which uses blockchain technology to secure users\u2019 personal information for use across the internet, agrees that it is essential for Catholics to get involved in the crypto space.\n\n\u201cIf [Catholics] want the new blockchain world to reflect Catholic values, now is the time to be involved, because people are setting up the technology now,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the way things tend to go is once you set up a technology, or a protocol, it gets network effects, and then it gets hard to change over time.\u201d\n\nWhile Pinto and others are distinctly optimistic that the church\u2019s crypto-future is bright and fruitful, others urge cautious discernment. Levi Checketts, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University who specializes in the intersection of theology and technology, notes that \u201ctechnologies change moral frameworks entirely by opening new moral possibilities and new moral obligations, and sometimes foreclosing other ones.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe question is, how are these technologies changing what our moral options and requirements are?\u201d he says. \u201cEach technology creates its own constellation of moral variables.\u201d\n\nCryptonomics\n\nCryptocurrencies have become a favorite asset for many speculators in part due to the volatility of their valuation. When Bitcoins first became available in 2009, they were generally valued at $0.0008. In 2021, that valuation reached an all-time high of $61,837 per coin. Since then, the value of a single Bitcoin has continued to fluctuate wildly, falling as low as $16,000 in late 2022 and rising to about $27,000 in May 2023. Much of this Bitcoin is held by only a few individuals: According to the Wall Street Journal, as of 2021, approximately 0.01 percent of all Bitcoin users hold 27 percent of the coins in circulation.\n\nFor Anthony Annett, an economist and author of the book Cathonomics (Georgetown University Press), this is a natural outcome of a neoliberal approach to economics that places profit ahead of the common good\u2014an approach he says has led\n\nto the massive rise in global wealth inequality.\n\n\u201cNeoliberalism basically says that the market leads to greater efficiency, greater productivity, greater wealth, and the government is only impeding that wealth creation and should get out of the way,\u201d he says. \u201cBut even though we had a lot of economic growth over the past 40 years, that growth has only benefited the top echelons of society. It hasn\u2019t benefited ordinary people. This is a major moral failure.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs there a way to square the frequently speculative use of cryptocurrency with an economy oriented toward the common good? Pinto believes that cryptocurrency can provide access to key financial services such as long-distance money transfers to those who would otherwise be unable to access them without steep costs.\n\n\u201cThere are about two and a half billion people who are unbanked in the world; they just need a smartphone and [using cryptocurrency] they can send money without paying Western Union transmission fees or losing two days of life to go from the village into the city,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are serious social justice ramifications to this, and I actually think that this could be a great equalizer.\u201d\n\nChecketts notes, however, that cryptocurrency has also been used to prop up many exploitative business practices and industries in developing nations. Much of the work that pays in cryptocurrency and is available in poorer countries, he says, is in the form of data tagging\u2014identifying and categorizing images and other content\u2014through services such as Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (or MTurk) platform, which enables businesses to crowdsource tasks such as data tagging, transcription, and copyediting, usually paying little more than a few cents per task.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just exploitative in terms of timing and the way people have to compete for jobs, but also they just have to sift through some of the nastiest stuff, because [the jobs involve] filtering content that is marked mature and such,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there are other types of work that are fairly exploitative such as cam girls. They can do this kind of work in [developing] countries and get paid through electronic means, but it\u2019s very exploitative and very detrimental to not only their own well-being, but also to their families and society.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt becomes this whole other structure of exploitation and neocolonialism,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the problem is that we\u2019re trying to solve the question of poverty and poor distribution of resources by creating a technology that\u2019s not inherently directed to that goal.\u201d\n\nMore than money\n\nFor many, the real promise of blockchain technologies is not cryptocurrency itself, but its numerous other uses, primarily in the realms of ownership and privacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeacon Rich Napoli recently retired from his position as chief executive officer of Relevantz, a software engineering company that makes regular use of blockchain technology, after spending almost 45 years in the software business. For him, cryptocurrency is better understood as a proof-of-concept for other, more viable blockchain technologies. \u201cI think it has real potential,\u201d he says. \u201cBut cryptocurrency as it exists today? Not so much. I think it proved the capability, the technology, but it\u2019s been abused, and it\u2019s not necessarily useful in reality.\u201d\n\nOne non-cryptocurrency blockchain technology that has been gaining increasing attention is non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Unlike cryptocurrencies, each NFT is a verifiably unique entry on the blockchain, certifying ownership of a specific, one-of-a-kind item, digital or otherwise. Similar to cryptocurrency, however, the initial rise in the popularity of NFTs was also buoyed by speculation, this time in the form of a digital art market. Digital art that has been registered on the blockchain (or \u201cminted as an NFT\u201d) frequently fetches massive sums of money at auction. The most expensive recorded sale was of The Merge, a collection of digital images created by an artist known as Pak, which fetched a whopping $91.8 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome, like Checketts, see NFTs as a misguided attempt to bring properties of the real world into a digital space. \u201cThere\u2019s an irony here, because I think one of the great advances and positive benefits of digital technology is the way that certain information is easily, nearly perfectly transcribed from one place to another,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWalter Benjamin has this interesting essay on art and reproduction: He says the function of modern technology is about perfect reproduction and, because of this, it removes what he calls the aura of artwork,\u201d Checketts says. \u201c[NFTs] are, in a way, trying to bring that back, but the problem is that defeats the whole purpose of this kind of [digital technology].\u201d\n\nNapoli, however, believes that the blockchain has the potential to democratize the creative landscape and to empower both artists and fans, as it offers the opportunity to do away with gatekeeping institutions such as record labels. \u201cWith the blockchain, you don\u2019t need an intermediate,\u201d he says. \u201cAn artist can put their music on the blockchain and sell it directly to you and me without a middleman. They get the full value of the song, and we get to enjoy the song at probably a lower price than if we had to pay a record label.\u201d\n\nTune.FM, a blockchain-based music streaming platform started in 2022, is one platform seeking to implement this vision. Every song hosted on the platform is minted as an NFT, and, according to a whitepaper issued by Tune.FM describing the platform, artists can supposedly earn 90 percent of the revenue generated by each stream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis kind of democratization and decentralization of the digital world is the driving force behind what has come to be known as Web3. According to Pinto, Web3 is the next logical step in the continuing evolution of the internet.\n\n\u201cWeb1 is basically passive one-way communication. Say someone sells wicker chairs\u2014he puts up a website and a phone number, and maybe a means by which people can order them,\u201d he says. \u201cWeb2 enables two-way communication: It\u2019s Twitter, it\u2019s Facebook, you\u2019re now communicating with the world, and the world is communicating back to you. Web3 enables you to own the assets you publish\u2014they\u2019re no longer owned by Facebook or another platform.\u201d\n\nAnnett says, however, that this prioritization of decentralization is actually a misreading of the principle of subsidiarity. \u201cI think subsidiarity is the most misunderstood and misinterpreted principle of Catholic social teaching,\u201d he says. \u201cSubsidiarity basically says, you want to do things at the lowest level possible, but the highest level necessary. It\u2019s not an excuse for libertarianism, for hands-off government, or for free market ideology.\u201d\n\nTrustless societies\n\nA key term that frequently resurfaces in conversations about blockchain technologies is that they are trustless. In other words, the problem they aim to solve is transferring value peer-to-peer without a trusted middleman. But what does it look like for a society\u2014or even just an organization\u2014to function without the need for trusted human relationships?\n\nOn one level, this emphasis on trustlessness is pragmatic: In a highly globalized society, many if not most of the relationships that keep society and the economy afloat are almost unavoidably built without the high level of interpersonal knowledge needed to make trust a reality. As polls continue to show trust in American institutions\u2014governmental, religious, and otherwise\u2014collapsing, perhaps removing trust from the equation altogether is a viable way forward.\n\nSome corporations are already beginning to take advantage of this aspect of blockchain technology to solve large-scale coordination problems, such as those that affect supply chains. Take Walmart for example: The retail chain has already incorporated the blockchain into its produce supply chain, allowing for reliable, farm-to-table tracing of all of its products. \u201c[Walmart] had a big issue five years ago with a farm selling tainted lettuce, and they couldn\u2019t track down where it went,\u201d Napoli says. \u201cThey had to pull every romaine lettuce off the shelf throughout the entire country.\u201d But now, with the implementation of blockchain technology in their chain of custody, Walmart is capable of only pulling produce known to be tainted from stores, preventing massive amounts of food waste.\n\nPinto sees a number of parallel use-cases for the blockchain in the life of the church, including having a secure back-up of sacramental records (which, since they are stored on paper in parish files, are vulnerable to loss and damage) and keeping an immutable record of priest assignments in order to prevent the cover-up of abuse or other bad behavior. \u201cFor those concerned about past transgressions regarding reassigning clergy or religious who have engaged in bad actions, putting a record of clergy or religious assignments on a blockchain would show the sequence of locations where someone engaged in ministry,\u201d he says.\n\nLeaning heavily on this type of trustless organization may, however, have unintended consequences. Take Millegan\u2019s case, for example. When one of his tweets from 2016 that condemned LGBTQ people, abortion, and numerous other issues resurfaced in 2022, he was quickly removed from many of the positions he held in the Ethereum Name Service except for his role as director of the Ethereum Name Service Foundation. This was possible thanks to the fact that the organization itself was governed through the blockchain as a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDAOs take the emphasis on trustlessness to the organizational level: They are designed, at least in theory, to promote transparency and accountability by making use of predefined smart contracts, which automatically carry out organizational functions based on the votes of their members. Thanks to this structure, a vote of all the DAO\u2019s members determined whether Millegan would remain in his role or be removed for propagating rhetoric viewed as hateful or discriminatory. Forty-three percent voted that he remain, while 37 percent voted that he be removed. Nineteen percent abstained.\n\nThere are those who maintain that DAOs can be a boon for organizing mass movements. In an interview with crypto-industry news source Cointelegraph, Rhodri Davies, head of the UK-based Charities Aid Foundation, said, \u201cWe have already seen a growing trend for such movements to take the form of loose networks rather than traditional centralized organizations (e.g. Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, the climate strikes). Often these movements face challenges in terms of maintaining focus and momentum, or carrying out practical action, and the additional structure provided by a DAO might enable them to overcome these challenges without having to adopt traditional approaches.\u201d\n\nUpon this blockchain\n\nAlthough the institutional church has a reputation for, as the old adage goes, \u201cthinking in centuries,\u201d it has already begun to make a few small forays into making use of blockchain technology.\n\nThe Vatican itself has recently begun using NFT technology to track and archive its extensive collections of books, manuscripts, and artifacts in the Vatican Library. Partnering with NTT DATA, a Tokyo-based IT firm, the library will also begin providing NFTs of various items it holds to supporters, allowing them to own a part of their extensive archives, according to a February 2023 NTT DATA press release.\n\nOn the diocesan level, the Archdiocese of Washington announced in August 2022 that it would begin accepting charitable donations in cryptocurrency, a first for any diocese. \u201cAn important aspect of fostering the culture of philanthropy is to take the mystery out of many ways the faithful can support the church\u2014in short, make supporting the good works of the church as easy as possible and meeting supporters where they are in terms of a preferred method of giving,\u201d says Joseph Gilmer, executive director of development for the archdiocese. \u201cCrypto now stands alongside other giving options such as stocks and bonds, mutual funds, direct transfers from traditional IRAs, and donor-advised funds that may appeal to some donors and possibly enable them to be even more generous for their favorite charitable program or ministry.\u201d\n\nWhile these are certainly not enormous, world-changing initiatives, they do point to the institutional church\u2019s openness to embrace these new technologies, potentially paving the way for greater uses in the future. Though Napoli notes that this kind of slow, careful exploration of new technologies may be at times frustrating, he also sees it as the prudent way forward for the church.\n\n\u201cAs a business leader, I\u2019m used to doing everything really quickly, but the church, in its wisdom, is not fast to adopt things in general,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is this notion that it\u2019s better to be safe and slow than fast and realize that you did something wrong, something that looked like it was consistent with the faith but turns out not to be.\u201d\n\nWhile the institutional church takes its time, however, Pinto and others are keeping busy organizing laypeople to discuss further use cases of blockchain technology in the life of the church. As of May, recordings of the 2022 Catholic/Crypto Conference session have begun to be released on YouTube, and according to Pinto there are plans underway for a second conference in April 2024. In addition, a whitepaper based on the first conference\u2019s proceeds is due to be released in the summer of 2023, detailing further proposed use cases for blockchain technology in the church, including maintaining Catholics\u2019 sacramental records more securely and accessibly as well as tracking the chain of custody and authenticity of relics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even as this work continues and blockchain technology gradually makes its way into the life of the church, the question remains as to whether this\u2014or any\u2014technology will be the solution to what ails the church and the world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of creating new philosopher\u2019s stones or new magic technologies that will [solve our problems],\u201d says Checketts. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of putting our own selfish motivations behind us.\u201d\n\nThis article also appears in the July 2023 issue of U.S. Catholic (Vol. 88, No. 7, pages 20-25).

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s SOPR could repeat history, helping investors stay profitable\n\nELR indicated renewed interest in opening BTC derivative contracts\n\nExpecting a short-term Bitcoin [BTC] recovery is something that many market participants may not hope for. However, a pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk has opined that it is not impossible.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nAccording to the analyst, the position of the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) offers this potential. As a macro market sentiment indicator, the SOPR measures the degree of realized profits moved on-chain.\n\nBTC: Offering an advantage to holders\n\nValues over 1 of the SOPR suggest that investors are selling at a profit. On the other hand, SOPR values below 1 indicate average selling at a loss. And, at press time, the value of the metric was above.\n\nHowever, Crazzyblockk\u2019s argument is the longevity that the metric has had in its current position. In fact, the datasets revealed that Bitcoin\u2019s SOPR has stayed above the value since March.\n\nThis led the analyst to compare the state in 2017 and 2019 with the SOPR at press time.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2016, the SOPR consistently maintained its value above 1. Thus, this led BTC\u2019s price to hit $20,000 in 2017. The analyst also mentioned that the SOPR condition in 2019 was vital to the BTC All-Time High (ATH) in 2021. Crazzyblock added,\n\n\u201cWhen the number 1 of this data maintain for consecutive months, and the pocket value of these holders moves above this level is a sign of a strong interest in staying in the market and gaining profitability. 2015 and 2019 price cycles are good examples.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, there is strong interest in the market. Additionally, the current demand is enough to withstand any heavy selling pressure, the analyst added.\n\nBig bets on which direction?\n\nMeanwhile, BTC continued its consolidation over the last 24 hours. Despite that, the Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) has been rising.\n\nTypically, the ELR shows how much leverage is used by users. And, it\u2019s calculated by dividing the Open Interest (OI) by the coin reserves. Lower values of the ELR suggest that investors are being cautious of the leverage used.\n\nHowever, when the ELR hikes, it means that participants are taking big bets on their derivative traders.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nWhether long or short, the increase also aligns with the aforementioned discussion around the strong interest in the market.\n\nAdditionally, oinonen_t, another CryptoQuant analyst, noted that the liquidity collapse in the market has not negatively affected Bitcoin\u2019s strength. Citing rising accumulation and active addresses, the analyst highlighted,"

        "title": "Best Bitcoin Wallets for 2024 - Bitcoin Australia",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency is undoubtedly coming into the mainstream. With Bitcoin\u2019s market cap alone being over USD $979 billion at the time of writing, it\u2019s hard to deny the digital currency is a legitimate asset.\n\n\n\nBut blockchain technology facilitates so much more than just an asset or a store of value. The creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, envisioned a peer-to-peer payment system where transactions of value could be made without trust or physical assets.\n\nThat being said, whether you are buying Bitcoin as a way to store value, as an investment, or a way to make anonymous payments, you will need a Bitcoin wallet. With more and more entering the market every day, bitcoin.com.au decided to take a look at the best Bitcoin wallets.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin Wallet?\n\nWallets are an essential part of a functioning cryptocurrency. They are a way for users to access and interface with the blockchain. Wallets allow users to view, buy, sell, send, and receive the cryptocurrency they own. In many cases, a wallet is exclusive to a cryptocurrency. This often means you will need one for your Bitcoin, a separate one for your Ethereum, and so on. Of course, certain apps and hardware wallets allow you to view all your wallets at once.\n\nEach wallet has its own private keys and public addresses. If you don\u2019t have access to these, you don\u2019t truly own your Bitcoin. For example, Coinbase wallets might be easy to use, but wallets on exchanges don\u2019t give you full control of your digital assets. If you buy Bitcoin on an exchange and keep it in the on-exchange wallet, and that exchange gets hacked or goes down, your Bitcoin will disappear with it. It\u2019s essential to have your keys or addresses as well as your mnemonic passphrase. With these things in your hands, you have full control of your cryptocurrency and can access it anywhere.\n\nYour private key can be seen as a password, that only you should know. It gives you access to your assets on the blockchain. Your public Bitcoin address is what you use to send and receive Bitcoins. Originally, Bitcoin users had to generate new addresses for each transaction however, today almost all wallets are an HD wallet or a Hierarchical Deterministic wallet. This is essentially a wallet that uses a hierarchical tree-like structure of private/public addresses (or keys). This addresses the issue of users having to generate new addresses each time they want to make a Bitcoin transaction.\n\nThere\u2019s a range of different wallet types that fall into different categories, some of which we will look at below. Each has its own pros and cons and the right one for you will depend on your circumstances, and what you intend to do with Bitcoin. With that said, here are the best Bitcoin wallets, depending on your needs.\n\nBest Online Wallet\n\nOnline wallets, as the name suggests, are platforms for you to store your digital assets in a completely online environment. This is known as a hot wallet. These wallets are sometimes on an exchange, such as Bitcoin.com.au, or have a function for you to buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies right from the wallet.\n\nBitcoin.com.au is a leading Australian Bitcoin exchange and wallet provider.

It offers a wide range of features, including staking, exchange, DeFi, NFTs, and security.\n\nStaking\n\nExodus allows users to stake their Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to earn rewards. Staking is a process of locking up your cryptocurrency in order to help verify transactions on the blockchain. In return for locking up your cryptocurrency, you will earn rewards in the form of new tokens.\n\nExchange\n\nExodus also allows users to swap between different cryptocurrencies directly within the wallet. This makes it easy to diversify your portfolio and take advantage of price movements in different cryptocurrencies.\n\nDeFi\n\nExodus gives users access to decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. DeFi is a new financial system that is built on top of blockchain technology. DeFi applications allow users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on their cryptocurrency without the need for a third party.\n\nNFTs\n\nExodus also allows users to store, manage, and trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFTs are unique digital assets that cannot be replaced. They can represent anything from artwork to in-game items.\n\nSecurity\n\nExodus uses industry-leading security practices to protect your funds. Your private keys are never stored on Exodus\u2019 servers, and they are protected by a 256-bit encryption. Exodus also offers 24/7 customer support in case you need help with anything.\n\nBest Wallet for Security\n\nLedger Nano X \u2013 $250 AUD\n\nLedger Nano X is a hardware wallet that stores your Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offline, making them immune to online threats. It is the most secure way to store your cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt is a small, portable device that connects to your computer or mobile device via USB or Bluetooth.

Versatile: Supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and many more.\n\nIf you are looking for the best security bitcoin wallet, then Ledger Nano X is the perfect choice for you.\n\nBest Hardware Wallet\n\nIn general, Bitcoin hardware wallets are the most secure forms of crypto storage. Known as cold storage, hardware wallets usually store your crypto in an offline reserve, making it hard for malware attacks to get through. Hardware wallets are physical devices with sophisticated security measures so they will have a price tag, but for those who are buying large amounts of Bitcoin, the price is worth the added level of security. We have mentioned the Ledger Nano, but there are a few alternatives when it comes to hardware wallets such as the Trezor and KeepKey wallets. Typically, a hardware wallet supports a huge number of cryptocurrencies, for example, the Ledger Nano supports over 1000 coins including BTC, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Ripple and Litecoin.\n\nTrezor Model T Wallet \u2013 $332 AUD\n\nThe Trezor is the main alternative to a Ledger X, and was one of the first hardware wallets to hit the market. Its updated model, the Model T, is a relatively new wallet and the latest in crypto hardware storage. Trezor is a multi-purpose, multi-digital asset security device used to secure Bitcoin transactions along with a huge range of altcoins including Ripple (XRP) and Litecoin. It is also a powerful password manager and a two-factor authentication device. The Trezor should satisfy the most serious crypto investors.\n\nBest Desktop Wallet\n\nA desktop wallet is similar to an online wallet, however, you have the wallet\u2019s software downloaded onto your computer as an application. Typically, these have good user interfaces and decent security. The best desktop wallets will allow you to export your private keys and encourage you to store your keys offline in \u201ccold storage\u201d.\n\nElectrum \u2013 Free\n\nElectrum wallet is one of the most popular open-source software wallets on the market. It has the ability to be compatible with some hardware wallets such as the Ledger Nano and is functional completely offline. Electrum\u2019s servers are decentralised which means there\u2019s no downtime. The wallet has a bunch of other technical features which make it fast and secure such as multi-signature functionality to split the permission to spend your coins between several wallets.\n\nBest Mobile Wallet\n\nA mobile wallet is similar to a desktop wallet, only it\u2019s a mobile app on your mobile device, rather than your desktop. Like all wallets, mobile wallets allow users to interface with the Bitcoin network and see the amount of Bitcoin they own.\n\nMycelium \u2013 Free\n\nMycelium was awarded the \u201cBest Mobile App\u201d award by Blockchain.info in 2014. It has \u201cWatch Only\u201d accounts, which are wallets stored without their corresponding key, so there\u2019s no chance of it being stolen. Mycelium makes it allows users to access and use Bitcoin whether it\u2019s on an iPhone or Android device. The Mycelium interface is known to be a little more complicated than other entry-level wallets but it has a range of features that experienced users of Bitcoin will appreciate. With \u201cbank-grade security\u201d for its mobile app and integrations from third parties such as Trezor, Mycelium is a great mobile wallet, for Bitcoin users on the go.\n\nThese Bitcoin wallets are some of the best in their categories. Each has their own pros and cons and Bitcoin users will choose a wallet on their individual needs. Regardless of choice, a Bitcoin wallet is essential to buy bitcoin, store it securely and transfer it."

        "title": "Bitcoin Dips Below US$26K: Bearish Sentiment Will Continue in Q3? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the king of all cryptocurrencies is facing a downturn as the price dropped below US$26k\n\nAfter a disastrous 2022, this year was supposed to be the year of recovery for the crypto market. The combined market cap of all tokens rose above US$1 trillion for the first time in almost a year and the entire sector was pumping, entering a decisive bullish phase. However, some experts claim that the crypto market rally is over. Especially after Bitcoin failed to reach the US$30k mark.\n\nBitcoin, often referred to as the \u201cking\u201d of cryptocurrencies, holds a prominent position in the market. Its decentralized nature, limited supply, and growing adoption by institutions have established its reputation as a reliable investment. Despite occasional price volatility, Bitcoin has consistently demonstrated resilience throughout, making it an appealing choice for long-term investors seeking stability.\n\nWith a dominant market cap and a solid track record, Bitcoin continues to attract mainstream attention and financial institutions. Its position as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation remains unchallenged. However, it is essential to consider factors such as regulatory developments, market sentiment, and technological advancements that can impact Bitcoin\u2019s future trajectory.\n\nThe BTC price soared since the new year and settled around US$28,000 till last week and suddenly dropped after the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase, now valued at around US$25,800. This intricate value made the market experience a bearish chart pattern.\n\nThe BTC value declined to 3.10% in seven days. This descending chart pattern indicates that the value even falls lesser than US$23,000. Adverse macroeconomic factors, adverse central bank policies, and negative regulatory attention are the factors behind the downturn in BTC prices.\n\nAlthough each nation wants to encourage digital assets, they can\u2019t oversee the impostor activities that happening in the crypto sector. To address this concern, SEC has regulated new rules to have transparency and accountability. However, with strict regulations, the crypto coins prices are currently swinging.\n\nAs of the latest prediction by crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, Bitcoin could undergo significant fluctuations, potentially dropping over 50% or appreciating by over 30% in the coming months. It is essential to keep an eye on Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory as it can impact the overall market sentiment.\n\nThe price action has formed a series of higher lows and lower highs leading to the appearance of a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. If the technical setup plays out correctly, then traders could witness a 13.11% rally for the flagship crypto on the upside from the triangle\u2019s resistance line. However, the movement could be in either direction.\n\nAt press time, BTC was exchanging hands at US$25,802 with a Bearish bias. Rising above this level would confirm a bullish breakout toward the optimistic target of the technical chart pattern at US$28,385 but it can also drop up to US$23,652.\n\nAlthough the bullish outlook on Bitcoin hasn\u2019t yet become evident, traders can still look for signs to identify an early trend reversal. RSI (Relative Strength Index) could drop a bit lower before bouncing off the average level. AO (Awesome Oscillator) shows a drop in bullish momentum but is close to a zero-line reset. Even after the downturn, many analysts still have faith that things could improve.\n\nEven though Bitcoin is known for its ability to overcome challenges and make strong comebacks, the doubts that the investors have are more than obvious at this point. The crypto market is changing rapidly, and some enthusiasts are beginning to question whether Bitcoin is worth investing in.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "A payment fintech launched in 2021 says it is now enabling more than 400 small businesses to accept and process Bitcoin payments.\n\nPouch.ph, the fintech firm behind the first lightning wallet for the Philippines, is tapping into the country\u2019s vast pool of tiny merchants \u2014 from mom-and-pop stores to boutique hotels.\n\nPouch.ph utilizes Lightning Network built atop Bitcoin to make digital payments quicker, cheaper, and more user-friendly. This payment protocol allows customers to pay by scanning a merchant\u2019s QR code with any Bitcoin wallet. Pouch.ph then converts that Bitcoin to Pesos and sends the money directly to the merchant\u2019s bank or mobile money account, making the process easy and efficient for both parties.\n\n\u201cOne of the most significant challenges for the growth of small businesses is the availability of payment methods, with credit cards charging fees up to three percent. With the growing number of internet and smartphone users in the Philippines, Bitcoin as a payment method will allow those who do not have credit cards or even local fiat currency to make online or in-store purchases. We\u2019re helping businesses open up a vast market that was previously untapped,\u201d Pouch.ph CEO Ethan Rose said in a statement.\n\nMore than 250 local businesses in the popular tourist destination of Boracay, including convenience stores, cafes, hotels, and restaurants, have already enrolled with Pouch.ph and have been integrating Bitcoin payments into their daily operations.\n\nFor Erielyn Gaston, owner of Kasbar restaurant, accepting Bitcoin as payment allowed her to attract a wider customer base and increase sales.\n\n\u201c[Pouch.ph] has been very helpful as another mode of payment other than credit cards and e-wallets which is the usual mode of payment here [in Boracay],\u201d she said in a panel discussion during the Bitcoin Island conference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very convenient to have a payment service that\u2019s fast and easily available so that for us, in regards to increasing the revenue, it allows people to stay longer because the other alternative that is there is one of these ATMs that are not from the banks the tourists [use]. If you ever add up the fees they charge for credit card users minus the exchange rate difference, you end up paying 10% to 11% if you withdraw from these ATMs,\u201d Tindahan It Boracay Manager Marcel Selfer said.\n\nBuilding on this success, the fintech firm is actively expanding its reach beyond \u201cBoracay Bitcoin Island\u201d and has onboarded merchants in Cebu City, Dumaguete, Iloilo, and Bacolod City.\n\nIn Metro Manila, some establishments have also started accepting Bitcoin as a valid form of payment through Pouch.ph such as the night bar URBN QC in Quezon City, Draper Startup House in Makati City, and niche retailer KosneyLand located inside a mall in Mandaluyong City.\n\nAside from receiving payments, some partner merchants use Pouch.ph for payroll. With Batch Pay feature, business owners can instantly send money in batches to employees, suppliers, and other recipients, including transfers to all major banks and e-wallets. They can transfer payroll directly to a Pouch Netbank Account with no fees, or to a nominated bank account for a minimal fee. This innovative solution aims to simplify and streamline payment processes for businesses across the country.\n\nPouch.ph is also preparing to extend its Batch Pay services for over-the-counter remittances through LBC, M Lhuillier, and Palawan Pawnshop.\n\nLocals and tourists can find merchants that accept Bitcoin payments using BTCMap.org."

        "content": "As Bitcoin (BTC) is starting to witness modest gains in recent days, during which the cryptocurrency industry is struggling under the pressure of lawsuits that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed against two crypto exchanges, a bullish run could be ahead judging by a repeating trend.\n\nSpecifically, Bitcoin is currently moving above its exponential moving average (EMA) on 20 observed time periods and is demonstrating two bars in its Bollinger Band width percentile (BBWP), as observed by the pseudonymous crypto analyst el_crypto_prof a.k.a. Moustache, in a tweet shared on June 13.\n\nBy comparison, the same chart pattern had emerged seven years before, in 2016, right before a \u201cmega bull run\u201d began for the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, during which its price had soared as much as 3,200%, ultimately reaching the top at $19,033, from the mere $580.\n\nBitcoin price action analysis. Source: el_crypto_prof\n\nAccording to the cryptocurrency expert\u2019s Bitcoin chart analysis, a similar pattern occurred following the Covid-19 crash in 2020, after which the maiden crypto asset saw a bull run of more than 600% to its price, culminating at $56,031, up from around $7,800.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Bitcoin is currently trading at the price of $26,196, demonstrating an increase of 0.91% on the day and 1.59% over the past week, whereas, on its monthly chart, it is writing down a loss of 2.44%, as per the latest data retrieved on June 13.\n\nBitcoin 7-week price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nDespite occasional struggles, Bitcoin has still managed to increase its price by nearly 60% since the year\u2019s turn, turning almost 48,000 crypto investors into millionaires, and recently, the accumulating behavior of its largest holders has indicated a possibility of a strong rebound.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
