        "content": "Bitcoin could hit a new record high next year, said Bob Ras, cofounder of blockchain firm Sologenic.\n\nHe cited bitcoin halving, which will reduce mining rewards and supply of the token.\n\nThe banking crisis and expectations that the Fed will start easing may also lift bitcoin, he added.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

It's meant to cut the supply of tokens and historically has sparked price increases.\n\n\"When bitcoin's halving kicks in a year from now, we'll likely be well on our way past the previous all-time high,\" Ras told Insider.\n\nThat would mean bitcoin soars past the $67,000 level reached in November 2021, up from about $29,000 on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin appears to be front-running the belief that looser policy from the Federal Reserve is on the way, Ras explained.\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday hiked rates for the 10th consecutive time, but Wall Street widely expects that to be the last increase of this tightening cycle.\n\nHe thinks the token's rally points to a future that is effectively a return to lower rates and more quantitative easing.\n\nTechnical indicators, such as long-term moving averages, suggest upside and momentum, he said, but it's the broader landscape that will determine its performance the rest of the year. And he wouldn't be surprised if bitcoin hits $40,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Coupled with signs of slowing [economic] growth, the changing macro picture is pointing towards a Fed that will likely soon have to cut interest rates and inject a lot of liquidity into the market,\" Ras said. \"If the Fed doesn't do this, then we could face a serious contraction, punctuated by a possible credit crunch. Either way, all roads appear to be leading to a loosening of monetary policy sooner rather than later.\"\n\nRas isn't alone in his bullishness. Standard Chartered published a recent note that said bitcoin could soar to $100,000 by the middle of next year, and Matrixport predicted that bitcoin could more than double to about $65,000 by next April.\n\nA hedge against financial turmoil\n\nAs the banking crisis that started with Silicon Valley Bank in March continues to spark contagion fears, more retail and institutional investors have been turning to bitcoin as a hedge, Ras said.\n\nThat turmoil re-emerged over the past week as regulators seized First Republic on Monday and sold the bulk of its assets to JPMorgan, triggered sell-offs at regional banks PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The banking crisis helped to cement the narrative of bitcoin serving as a key store of value that lacks the sort of counterparty risk of holding funds by way of bank deposits,\" Ras said. \"Bitcoin offers protection by way of decentralization, self-custody and a network that has never been hacked.\"\n\nBut a credit crisis poses the biggest downside risk for bitcoin, he said. In such a scenario, bitcoin as well as gold, another traditional safe-haven investment, could see a sharp decline in value.\n\n\"I'm not sure such a scenario would happen,\" Ras said, \"but it's possible and would unleash a tremendous amount of volatility, not only for bitcoin but all markets.\""

        "content": "Crypto exchange Binance closed Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawals on May 7 due to an alleged overflow of transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe Bitcoin mempool was clogged with over 400,000 transactions waiting to be processed at the time of writing. The mempool is known as the \u201cwaiting area\u201d for incoming transactions before they are verified independently by each node on the network.\n\nBitcoin mempool at 16:42 UTC on May 7.

Outflows on the crypto exchange peaked on May 7, rising to $187 million, according to data from CryptoQuant.\n\nBehind the congestion is believed to be a surge in BRC-20 transactions in the last few days due to memecoins like Pepe (PEPE). The memecoin trading hype drove Bitcoin transaction fees to their highest point in two years. On May 3, the total amount of fees paid on the Bitcoin blockchain reached $3.5 million, jumping nearly 400% from late April, Cointelegraph reported.\n\nBitcoin outflow on Binance over the past seven days.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Mixers Are a Double-Edged Sword for Anti-Money Laundering Efforts - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Why Bitcoin Mixers Are a Double-Edged Sword for Anti-Money Laundering Efforts\n\nAlthough bitcoin mixers are frequently targeted by financial regulators in relation to anti-money laundering efforts, they are also used for a range of legitimate purposes such as protecting financial privacy and avoiding nefarious transaction monitoring.\n\nBitcoin has become one of the world\u2019s most popular forms of payment due to its convenience, speed, and low transaction fees. However, as more and more people use bitcoin for everyday transactions, privacy concerns have arisen. Bitcoin transactions are pseudo-anonymous, meaning that while transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, the identities of the sender and recipient are not necessarily known. This anonymity has made bitcoin a popular choice for those who value their privacy. However, the pseudo-anonymity of bitcoin has also made it attractive to criminals who use it for illegal activities such as money laundering. Since on-chain analytics companies can easily trace any blockchain transaction, more and more crypto users prefer coin-anonymizing services such as bitcoin mixers or bitcoin tumblers.\n\nBitcoin mixers have become a popular tool for those who want to keep their financial transactions private. While the concept of bitcoin mixers may seem innocent enough, they have become a double-edged sword in the fight against money laundering. According to a report by Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics company, the total value of bitcoin transferred through mixers increased from $11 million in 2022 to $67 million in 2023. This represents an increase of 500% in just one year. In this article, we will explore why bitcoin mixers are problematic for anti-money laundering efforts and how they can be used in a positive way.\n\nThe Dark Side of Bitcoin Mixers\n\nBitcoin mixers are online services that allow users to mix their bitcoins with other users\u2019 bitcoins. This process is also known as bitcoin mixing or bitcoin tumbling. The idea behind bitcoin mixing is to make it difficult for anyone to trace a bitcoin transaction back to its original owner.\n\nThis anonymity is a major problem for anti-money laundering efforts. Criminals can use bitcoin mixers to launder money by mixing their illegally obtained bitcoins with legitimate ones. The process of mixing makes it almost impossible to trace the illegal bitcoins back to their original source.\n\nAccording to a report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization that develops anti-money laundering guidelines, bitcoin mixers are one of the biggest threats to anti-money laundering efforts in the cryptocurrency space. The report states that mixers are mostly used by criminals to launder money and avoid detection by law enforcement. Although cryptocurrencies are often singled out by politicians and enforcement agencies when discussing money laundering, the reality is that crypto-related money laundering is a drop in the bucket compared to the global money laundering total.\n\nFor example, in 2021 Chainalysis estimated around US$9 billion was laundered using cryptocurrencies. In the same time period, the United Nations office on Drugs and Crime estimated total global money laundering to be at least $800 billion annually \u2013 and potentially up to $2 trillion. Even more surprising is the number of respected international banks that were fined in 2021 in relation to breaches of anti-money laundering laws and regulations.\n\nThe Positive Side of Bitcoin Mixers\n\nWhile bitcoin mixers are problematic for anti-money laundering efforts, they are also used for legitimate purposes. Many people use bitcoin mixers to protect their financial privacy and avoid potential transaction monitoring. For example, when someone buys something online using bitcoin, they may not want the seller to know their identity. By using a bitcoin mixer, they can ensure that their transaction is anonymous and cannot be traced back to them. Bitcoin mixing can help protect them from potential fraud or identity theft.\n\nBitcoin mixers are also often used by businesses to protect their financial information from competitors. If a company is making a large transaction, it may not want its competitors to know how much money it is moving. By using a bitcoin mixer, they can ensure that their transaction is private and cannot be traced back to them.\n\nAnother reason for seeking transaction privacy is political persecution. Of 205 countries and territories surveyed by Freedom House recently, in terms of their political rights and civil liberties, the NGO found 125 to be either \u2018not free\u2019 or only \u2018partly free\u2019. Political movements are costly to organise, and cutting of access to funding is a common tactic of oppressive governments.\n\nIn terms of personal security, bitcoin mixers can be used by law-abiding citizens to protect themselves from hacking and theft. By mixing their bitcoins with others, users can disguise the origin of their funds, making it more difficult for hackers to target them.\n\nTendencies to Regulate the Use of Bitcoin Mixers\n\nAs bitcoin has grown in popularity, there have been attempts by governments and regulators to bring it under their control. This has led to discussions about the regulation of bitcoin mixers, which are seen by some as only a tool for money laundering. In some countries, bitcoin mixers are currently illegal or operate in a legal gray area.\n\nFor example, in the United States, the use of bitcoin mixers is considered a violation of anti-money laundering laws, while in Japan, bitcoin mixers can only operate if they are licensed by the government. Similarly, in the European Union, bitcoin mixers are subject to anti-money laundering regulations and must comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin mixers are a double-edged sword for anti-money laundering efforts. While they can be used for illicit purposes, they also have legitimate uses in protecting financial privacy and preventing hacking and theft. It is important for governments and regulators to strike a balance between preventing illicit activity and protecting the legitimate uses of bitcoin mixers. Furthermore, the positive aspects of bitcoin mixers should not be overlooked. They are an important tool for individuals and businesses seeking to protect their financial privacy and secure their funds. The use of bitcoin mixers can help increase the adoption and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, which can lead to greater financial inclusion and economic empowerment. To fully realize the benefits of bitcoin mixers, it is important to promote transparency and collaboration between governments, regulators, and the cryptocurrency community. By working together, we can ensure that bitcoin mixers are used in a way that is responsible, legal, and beneficial for everyone. Ultimately, bitcoin mixers are an important tool in the cryptocurrency landscape that can be used for both good and bad. By recognizing their potential and working to mitigate their negative effects, we can create a safer and fairer financial system for all."

        "content": "Controversy Rises as Bitcoin Transaction Fees Continue Climb to Historical Highs\n\nControversy Rises as Bitcoin Transaction Fees Continue Climb to Historical Highs\n\nA recent phenomenon in the Bitcoin network has raised some concerns among users and observers. Some transactions are embedding images, texts, and other data into Bitcoin's blockchain using a technique called Ordinals Inscription. This process takes advantage of some updates to Bitcoin's code that allow for more flexibility and scalability, such as SegWit and Taproot.\n\nHowever, not everyone is happy with this trend. Some critics argue that the ordinals protocol is an attack on Bitcoin's fungibility, meaning that each bitcoin should be indistinguishable from another. They claim that by adding arbitrary data to the blockchain, ordinals make some bitcoins more valuable or desirable than others, depending on their content. For example, some ordinals inscriptions contain NFTs or digital art that could have a market value.\n\nAnother concern is that ordinals could pose a threat to Bitcoin's mission in El Salvador, where it is legal tender. Some fear that by filling up the blockchain with unnecessary data, ordinals could increase transaction fees and congestion, making Bitcoin less accessible and affordable for ordinary people.\n\nOrdinals are a controversial topic in the Bitcoin community, and there is no clear consensus on whether it is an improvement or an attack. Some see it as a way of expressing creativity and innovation, while others see it as a way of abusing and undermining Bitcoin's core principles."

        "content": "It\u2019s fair to say that Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) is not a fan of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nSherman has previously spoken extensively on the subject: \u201cCryptocurrencies are a crock [\u2026] They help criminals and terrorists [\u2026] they help startups perpetrate fraud [\u2026] undermine the dollar, encourage gambling for no social benefit [..] and are popular with guys who want to sit on their couch and tell their wives they are going to be millionaires.\u201d\n\nQuite why it\u2019s not popular with women who sit on the couch and tell their husbands they\u2019re going to be millionaires isn\u2019t clear. But let\u2019s be frank, misogyny comes in many forms.\n\nSherman is now upping his rhetoric. (Yes! Really!) And his assertion puts the con back into Congressman, designed as it is to advance a false, but damaging, narrative.\n\nQuote-tweeting The Bitcoin Conference, Sherman wrote that \u201c60 years ago, the late great Robert F. Kennedy #RFK went after tax evaders as U.S. attorney general. Today, his son is slated to speak at a conference for tax evaders.\u201d\n\nA conference for tax evaders.\n\nA sitting US Congressman just libeled me, and maybe you too.\n\nHis assertion is untrue and defamatory. I have attended The Bitcoin Conference, but I do not evade taxes. I have never evaded taxes. I do not intend to evade taxes. I may not love paying taxes, but I pay them anyway.\n\nYes, of course I\u2019m terrified of the IRS \u2014 who isn\u2019t, given the fact that you have to perjure yourself every time you file? \u2014 and that\u2019s certainly an incentive to file correctly. But I also believe in the social contract.\n\nI like roads, I like bridges, I like nuclear weap\u2026 okay, I like certain things I can\u2019t afford on my own, and if I disagree with the way the government spends the money I send them, I express my opposition at the ballot box.\n\nJust like you. Just like thousands of other crypto investors who pay their capital gains taxes.\n\nUnfortunately, and as we all know, politics is the real pay-to-play game.\n\nBrad Sherman is a politician who has done very well out of people who are threatened by cryptocurrencies and digital assets.\n\nIn 2021/22, the sector that donated most to Sherman was\u2026 the Securities & Investment industry, at $339,650.\n\nIn 2019/20, the sector that donated most to Sherman was\u2026 the Securities & Investment industry, at $246,965.\n\nIn 2017/18, the sector that donated most to Sherman was\u2026 the Securities & Investment industry, at $149,767.\n\nBefore this, it was mainly real estate. But then Sherman began attacking the crypto industry, and things changed.\n\nFrom 2019-2023, by the way, Sherman served as Chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets\n\nWho else do we know who\u2019s supposed to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation, and who really has it in for crypto?\n\nAh.\n\nAnyway, here are a few facts.\n\nBrad Sherman says that The Bitcoin Conference is for tax evaders.\n\nI am an attendee of The Bitcoin Conference.\n\nI pay my taxes, and can prove it.\n\nSherman should be aware, given his position, that people who sell Bitcoin pay taxes.\n\nSherman\u2019s statement causes me reputational harm, since \u201ctax evaders\u201d are held in dubious esteem.\n\nUnfortunately, if the group of people being defamed is large enough, and you\u2019re not personally identifiable within that group, you can\u2019t sue. (Any attorneys in the audience who disagree, feel free to ping me.)\n\nBut I\u2019ll be watching Brad Sherman\u2019s words carefully in future.\n\nJust in case I get the chance to make him eat them.\n\nThis op-ed first appeared in Blockworks\u2019 newsletter.

        "title": "Bitcoin Miners Reap Profits As Mining Difficulty Hits 3-Month Low - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin miners have received a boost in profits after the scheduled difficulty level adjustment resulted in a positive balance. This is the first time since February that the difficulty, which controls the issuance of coins on the network, has decreased. Recent data from Braiins showed that Bitcoin computing power experienced a drop of over 45+ EH/s between April 20 and 28. However, this trend has been reversed with the increase in miner profits over the last week.\n\nDespite the recovery of the hashrate to 350 EH/s, it was not sufficient to prevent a 1.45% difficulty adjustment retracement, as stated by Mempool.space. Currently, the mining difficulty level is at 48T (trillions). This change in difficulty level affects the miners\u2019 profitability, as less competition for the reward means increased estimated income for those still connected to the network.\n\nBitcoin Miners Profit As Hashprice Increases\n\nThe current price for Bitcoin hashpower rose to 0.088 USD/TH/day (88 USD/PH/day), up from 0.077 USD/TH/day (77 USD/PH/day) on May 2. This 11.49% increase over three days is a positive development for Bitcoin miners, indicating increased profitability for their operations. The hashprice is a crucial metric for calculating the profitability of a mining operation, representing the value assigned to a unit of computation in dollars per terahash or petahash per day. While the cause of the significant hashrate drop last week is uncertain, the current state of the network justifies the quick reconnection of miners.\n\nRecently, there has been increased interest in BRC-20 tokens, which are used to create memecoins, leading to network congestion in Bitcoin within a few days of their release. As recently reported, this could be a possible factor in the hashrate drop. As a result of this high activity on the network, the fees are now making up 12.4% of the miners\u2019 revenue.\n\nRelated Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Out: Experts Predict $36,000 Target As Market Outlook Remains Positive\n\nBitcoin Commissions Rise After New Ordinals Record\n\nIn the wake of the rising interest in tokens that can be registered to Bitcoin through Ordinals, the value of transaction fees paid by Bitcoin users has surged. Within a single day, the average transaction fees have more than doubled. As per the data from Mempool.space, the current transaction fees range from 70 sat/vB to 100 sat/vB. This implies that a transaction of 140 vB (median) would require payment of almost $4 USD to get confirmed within the first few minutes.\n\nNote that the sudden interest in tokens registered through Ordinals is responsible for the backlog of transactions that need confirmation, leading to a surge in average commissions. According to Murch, a Bitcoin developer, the mempool depth has reached 104 blocks despite having 8 blocks per hour for the last six hours. The rise of Ordinals NFTs has not been without controversy, as some Bitcoin maximalists blame this trend for the increased transaction fees that have resurfaced in recent months.\n\nRelated Reading: Former DoJ Kennedy Jr, Laments on Global Financial Censorship, Shows Support For Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,000, up 2% in the last week.\n\nFeatured Image from iStock.com, charts from Braain.com, Mempool.space and Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) could be set for historic gains thanks to a simple trend line breakout, a popular trader hopes.\n\nIn a Twitter discussion on May 5, Titan of Crypto flagged a rare bull signal on the Bollinger Bands indicator for the Bitcoin monthly chart.\n\nBitcoin price may see \u201cinexorable breakout\u201d\n\nBTC price action currently impacts sentiment in different ways across various timeframes. While observers are unsure about short-term moves, the consensus remains that Bitcoin\u2019s upside mainly lies ahead as the block subsidy halving approaches.\n\nWhen tracking what comes next, however, it may be enough to look at past halving cycles, specifically, volatility.\n\nAs Titan of Crypto notes, Bollinger Bands on monthly timeframes are setting up a repeat of a breakout event that has occurred only once in each cycle.\n\nIn the two previous instances shown on an accompanying chart from 2016 and 2019, BTC/USD broke through into the upper section of the Bollinger Band channel to see significant gains.\n\nBollinger Bands are a key volatility indicator across price timeframes. They revolve around a 20-period simple moving average (SMA) functioning as a midline, with two standard deviations above and below representing the channel.\n\nThese bands expand and contract with volatility and certain events: among them, the price coming into contact with the bands or even breaking beyond them is often considered important by traders.\n\nCurrently, the one-month BTC/USD chart shows the price attempting to break above the SMA line, which, if confirmed, would suggest a classic repeat of past bull runs.\n\nCommenting, Titan of Crypto described it as an \u201cinexorable breakout.\u201c\n\n\u201dBTC is about to break its monthly Bollinger Bands base line.

        "content": "Bitcoin fell in Monday morning trading in Asia after failing to breach the US$30,000 resistance ceiling over the weekend. Ether dropped below the US$1,900 mark, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to lower. XRP led the losers. U.S. equity futures traded flat after Wall Street\u2019s Friday rally. Stock investors have the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) out on Wednesday for the next look at the pace of inflation and a week ahead to find out if worries about the banking industry will ease.\n\nSee related article: Largest banks should fill void left in crypto following collapses, says Standard Chartered\u2019s Geoff Kendrick\n\nTop 10 crypto lose steam\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nBitcoin dropped 1.34% to US$28,594 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, losing 2.45% for the week. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached a weekly high of US$29,820 on Saturday, but then lost momentum.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden is pushing for a tax on cryptocurrency miners equal to 30% of the cost of the power they use, which could add downward pressure to the crypto market as miners may need to sell more Bitcoin to stay profitable.\n\nEther dipped 1.34% to US$1,882, inching down 0.10% for the week. The second largest cryptocurrency breached the US$2,000 resistance level on Saturday, but later fell back. Etherscan data showed the Ethereum Foundation moved about 15,000 Ether (US$30 million) to crypto exchange Kraken, a move that usually precedes sales.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged losses for the past 24 hours, with the exception of Litecoin, which edged up 0.71% to US$84.48, but traded down 4.71% for the week.\n\nXRP led the losers, falling 1.88% to US$0.4514 and moving down 4.31% for the week.\n\nPolkadot dropped 0.40% to US$5.64 and traded down 4.30% for the past seven days. Despite the price drop, the Polkadot blockchain is seeing increasing adoption from traditional finance. Deloitte, one of the Big Four accounting firms, said last Thursday it had integrated KLT protocol \u2013 a parachain of the Polkadot network \u2013 to improve the verification process in the company\u2019s Know Your Customer/Know Your Business checks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.03% in the past 24 hours to US$1.18 trillion. The total trading volume fell 24.79% to US$28.93 billion.\n\nNFT\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index slid 1.81% to 3,524.43 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, falling 5.59% for the week.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain saw its 24-hour NFT sales edge up 1.69% to US$14.99 million, but also logged US$11.11 million of \u201cwash trades\u201d, which surged 30.27%, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nWash trades involve an investor acting as both the buyer and seller of an asset to generate misleading trading volume and potentially manipulate prices. The practice is illegal in U.S. securities markets.\n\n\u201cWash trades make up a significant percentage of monthly transactions and are still largely driven by traders\u2019 farming points on the Blur marketplace,\u201d according to Forkast Labs NFT strategist Yehudah Petscher in a commentary on Saturday. He noted that \u201cwhile the total USD volume of global sales has been up in the past seven days, the Forkast 500, with wash sales removed, shows the NFT market actually losing value and is down over 2%.\u201d\n\nEquities\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 0.07%. The S&P 500 futures moved down 0.10%. And the Nasdaq Composite futures inched 0.09% lower.\n\nThe three U.S. stock indexes rallied on Friday, helped by strong earnings at Apple and a 4.69% jump in the company\u2019s share price on the day.\n\nWorries about the U.S. banking industry eased somewhat after JPMorgan Chase upgraded the outlook of three U.S. regional banks \u2013 Western Alliance Bancorp., Zions Bancorp. and Comerica Inc. \u2013 saying their stock prices were \u201csubstantially mispriced,\u201d according to Bloomberg on Saturday. The share price of lender PacWest Bancorp bounced back 81% on Friday after a 50% slump the day before.\n\nApril CPI numbers coming on Wednesday are forecast to rise 5.5% on year, a slight slowing from 5.6% in the previous month, according to Bloomberg on Sunday. The inflation number is watched as a signal for whether the Federal Reserve may pause its interest rate hikes in June.\n\nMeanwhile, concerns rumble on that the U.S. government could default on its debt as early as June, with the U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen again warning on Sunday that a constitutional crisis could be triggered if Congress failed to raise the debt ceiling in time, according to Reuters.\n\nThe potential default of the U.S. government could \u201cnegatively impact the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as part of a further risk-off approach by investors,\u201d said Mikkel Morch \u2013 Chairman and Non-Executive Director at crypto hedge fund ARK36 \u2013 in an emailed statement on Friday.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s next move on interest rates is due on June 14. Analysts at the CME Group now expect a 90.4% chance the Fed will keep the rates unchanged at 5% to 5.25%, and a 9.6% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike.\n\n(Corrects wash trade figures in second paragraph in NFT section.)\n\nSee related article: Pepe, Floki to list on Binance exchange"

        "title": "Dash (DASH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) & Sparklo (SPRK) - Which One Is A Better Buy? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency investing, staying ahead of the game can mean the difference between making a fortune and missing out on the next big thing.\n\nToday, numerous cryptocurrencies are vying for investors\u2019 attention, but among the top contenders are Dash (DASH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Sparklo (SPRK). Knowing where to place your bets can be challenging with so many options.\n\nHowever, after careful analysis, experts agree that Sparklo (SPRK) is the clear winner regarding potential return on investment. With potential growth up to 4,000 times, it\u2019s no wonder investors are flocking to Sparklo.\n\nSparklo Presale Momentum On The Rise As Bulls Take Control\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to be intrigued by Sparklo (SPRK)\u2019s incredible momentum. Though still in its presale, demand for this cryptocurrency is going through the roof. And it\u2019s easy to see why. On May 4th, the price of Sparklo (SPRK) increased by two cents with a current price of $0.019.\n\nThat\u2019s a significant jump! No wonder investors are rushing in before the second stage of the Sparklo (SPRK) presale. But what\u2019s so special about Sparklo (SPRK)? Well, its use case is simply fascinating.\n\nThrough its clever fractionalization of ownership, Sparklo (SPRK) lets you own a piece of valuable metals like gold, platinum, and silver. And transparency? Sparklo (SPRK) has that in spades.\n\nWith Sparklo\u2019s (SPRK) smart contract being audited by InterFi and locked in a 100-year liquidity lock, you can trust Sparklo\u2019s (SPRK) transparency practices. If Sparklo (SPRK)\u2019s momentum keeps up, some analysts predict it could do 4,000x.\n\nThat\u2019s something worth watching and perfect to include in a portfolio that includes both Dash (DASH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\n>>>> BUY SPARKLO TOKENS <<<\n\nDash Coin (DASH) Bearish As Investors Seek Better Returns Elsewhere\n\nDash (DASH) has been making waves in the crypto world due to its impressive use cases and widespread adoption. Its ability to facilitate private transactions at low fees has made it a highly sought-after crypto for everyday use.\n\nAdopted heavily in South America, Dash (DASH) has a strong foundation that has allowed it to remain in the upper echelon of cryptos. However, with its market cap already being substantial, analysts predict it may underperform the market.\n\nAs new crypto options emerge, analysts are looking towards up-and-coming options like Sparklo (SPRK) to outperform Dash (DASH) soon.\n\nNevertheless, Dash (DASH) remains a powerhouse in the world of cryptocurrencies, with its many benefits making it a top choice for crypto enthusiasts. Dash (DASH) adoption rate means it will remain one of the safest cryptos.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Growth Prospects As An Investment Weak\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is one of the most used cryptos today for business transactions. Many retailers and businesses that accept crypto do accept Bitcoin Cash (BCH). This gives Bitcoin Cash (BCH) an edge over many other cryptos.\n\nThat being said, analysts are not bullish on Bitcoin Cash (BCH), giving investors a return that they can\u2019t get from any other crypto.\n\nOn the bright side, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) can diversify. While Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\u2019s large market cap suggests a limited potential for exponential growth, plenty of smaller cryptocurrencies \u2013 like Sparklo (SPRK) \u2013 offer an opportunity for significant gains.\n\nA crypto like Sparklo (SPRK) is in so high demand that some analysts expect it to do 4,000X. That\u2019s something you can\u2019t get from Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\nBuy Presale: https://invest.sparklo.finance\n\nWebsite: https://sparklo.finance\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparklo_finance\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/sparklofinance\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "HMRC is considering introducing rules that would enable it to seize cryptocurrency from businesses that fail to pay their taxes.\n\nThe Government is mulling proposals that would give the tax agency powers to access online wallets as part of plans to modernise how tax is collected in the digital age.\n\nHMRC is already able to seize funds from bank accounts when individuals fail to pay tax under \u201cdirect recovery of debts\u201d powers, but is considering extending this to online payment accounts such as PayPal.\n\nA consultation document from HMRC raises the prospect that this could include businesses\u2019 cryptocurrency wallets if virtual currencies become a common way of making payments online.\n\nThe prospect of seizing cryptocurrencies from wallets would be seen as the latest crackdown on the sector, which has been accused of allowing money laundering and criminal activity. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have been touted as ways to give owners control of their finances outside of government control.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency wallets that are operated by individuals can only be accessed by the owner, those at centralised online exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance and Kraken could be subject to the rules.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are currently able to seize cryptocurrencies from these exchanges when they detect criminal activity.\n\n\u201cIf further regulation is brought in around digital currencies, it may be that cryptocurrency wallets may become a more popular method of paying for goods and services,\u201d a HMRC consultation document says.\n\nIt added that \u201cit was unclear how easy this would be due to the fluctuating value of cryptocurrency\u201d.\n\nThe Government said it expected to proceed and give HMRC powers to seize funds from digital wallets, although it is unclear if this will extend to cryptocurrencies.\n\nA HMRC spokesman said: \u201cThe proposals will help ensure HMRC\u2019s debt collection keeps pace with business practices. E-commerce means new business practices with fewer physical and owned assets held in the UK, which makes it harder for HMRC to collect unpaid taxes using existing powers.\n\n\u201cThe responses to this consultation will support the Government in undertaking additional analysis and engagement on the proposals.\n\n\u201cAll of HMRC\u2019s powers are balanced by safeguards, which should reassure taxpayers that powers are exercised proportionately and consistently.\u201d\n\nPolice have seized hundreds of millions of pounds in cryptocurrency linked to criminal operations, often auctioning it off.\n\nHMRC said recently that cryptocurrencies would be added to self assessment tax returns. It will mean an extra \u00a310m a year in capital gains taxes on profits that are not currently reported, forecasters estimate."

        "content": "The beating that Bitcoin (BTC) took during the bear market seems to be slowly ending. 2023 has certainly been a better year for the original cryptocurrency, and although it took a tumble towards the end of 2022, Bitcoin has risen by 65% since the beginning of the year. The storm is over, and the sun is shining through, but will the end of the bear market be a rain-on Big Eyes Coin\u2019s (BIG) parade?\n\nBitcoin Bounces Back From Bear Market Blues\n\nIt is crucial to honor the coin that launched the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Since Bitcoin\u2019s creation in 2009, there has been an abundance of other cryptocurrencies entering the market. Over the past few years, Bitcoin has dominated and seen an enormous price increase. Bitcoin was barely about $500 around May of 2016, but it is now worth almost $28.5K.\n\nDespite being the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin still has many flaws. Although it is the most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, investing in it carries some risk because of the token\u2019s high volatility. Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped by more than 75% in 2022 compared to its peak. Although the volatility may deter some investors, Bitcoin has the advantage of being widely accepted as a form of payment for everyday transactions due to its immense popularity.\n\nA lot of popular sports figures have signed contracts accepting Bitcoin and various other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. NBA star Andre Iguodala took to Twitter in early 2022 to announce he would be taking a portion of his salary in Bitcoin.\n\nDespite the hot and cold aspects of the market, it seems the clouds are clearing, and the sun is shining for Bitcoin this year. Already there has been a 65% increase in value for Bitcoin, and it seems that Bitcoin is leaving its market crash in the rearview mirror.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Due To Blossom\n\nWith its presale, the well-liked community-driven coin Big Eyes made recent history by earning over $35 million so far; as there is still a month left of the presale, things could make a drastic change. Big Eyes Coin is more than just an adorable crypto-conversant cat; Big Eyes wants to build something that any person can participate in; this cat cares about both people and the environment equally.\n\nAlthough it is refreshing to have a cryptocurrency pay so much close attention to the effects of climate change, so much so that it is choosing to dedicate five percent of all tokens to assisting charities with saving the oceans from pollution, at the end of the day, healthy fish makes for great cat food!\n\nWith the introduction of Loot Boxes, Big Eyes Coin has increased the intrigue surrounding presales. Presenting Big Eyes Coin as a means for people to win big, and as the end of the presale draws near, it isn\u2019t too late to purchase one before 3rd June. Alternatively, using code END300 before the deadline, potential investors can gain a healthy 300% ROI when buying $BIG!\n\nFor more on Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nOpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/big-eyes-lootbox-cards\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
