        "title": "Scaramucci sees bitcoin at $50,000 to $100,000 in 2-3 years as market hopes for bull run - CNBC",
        "content": "After a tumultuous 2022, crypto investors are trying to figure out when the next bitcoin bull run could be.\n\nLast week, at a crypto conference in St. Moritz, Switzerland, CNBC spoke to industry insiders who painted a picture of 2023 as year of caution. Bitcoin is expected to trade within a range, be sensitive to the macroeconomic situation such as interest rate rises and continue to be volatile. A new bull run is unlikely in 2023.\n\nHowever, experts are looking to next year and beyond with optimism.\n\nIn 2022, the entire cryptocurrency market lost about $1.4 trillion in value with the industry facing liquidity issues and bankruptcies topped off by the collapse of exchange FTX. Contagion spread across the industry.\n\nWhile bitcoin has gotten a small bump at the start of the year, in line with risk assets like stocks, experts say bitcoin is unlikely to retest its all-time high of just under $69,000 but it may have bottomed.\n\n\"I think there's a little bit more downside, but I don't think there's going to be a lot,\" Bill Tai, a venture capitalist and crypto veteran told CNBC last week.\n\n\"There's a chance that [bitcoin] kind of has bottomed here,\" adding that it could fall as low as $12,000 before jumping back up.\n\nMeltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at CoinShares, said bitcoin is likely to be rangebound trading at the lower end between $15,000 and $20,000 and on the upper end between $25,000 to $30,000.\n\nShe said a lot of the \"forced selling\" that happened in 2022 as a result of collapses in the market is now over, but there isn't much new money coming into bitcoin.\n\n\"I don't think there's a lot of forced selling remaining, which is optimistic,\" Demirors told CNBC Friday. \"But again, I think the upside is quite limited, because we also don't see a lot of new inflows coming in.\"\n\nInvestors are also keeping one eye on the macroeconomic situation. Bitcoin has proved to be closely correlated to risk assets such as stocks, and in particular, the tech-heavy Nasdaq . These assets are affected by changes in interest rates from the Federal Reserve and other macroeconomic moves. Last year, the Fed embarked on an aggressive interest rate hike path to try to tame inflation, which hurt risk assets along with bitcoin.\n\nIndustry insiders said a change in the macro situation could help bitcoin."

        "content": "Bitcoin surged over $21,000 on Saturday amid optimism that it may have bottomed and inflation has peaked.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency rose as much as 7.5% to $21,299, before paring gains as the day progressed. It hadn\u2019t been above $20,000 since Nov. 8, and Saturday was the 11th straight day of advances. Second-largest token Ether surged as much as 9.7%, and others such as Cardano and Dogecoin also notched gains. Solana soared as much as 35%.\n\nThe overall market cap of the crypto universe rose above $1 trillion for the first time since early November, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\n\u201cThere has been a steady grind higher since the start of the year,\u201d said Cici Lu, chief executive officer of Venn Link Partners Pte. \u201cIt feels like we hit a supply \u2018air pocket\u2019 and breaking through $20,000 resistance took out some stops. Optically, $20,000 for many is a key level.\u201d\n\nUS short-term inflation expectations fell in early January to the lowest in nearly two years, providing a bigger-than-expected boost to consumer sentiment, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary survey reading. A separate report showed consumer prices rising 6.5% in the 12 months through December, marking the slowest inflation rate in more than a year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is on track to downshift to smaller interest-rate increases following the further cooling in prices, though it\u2019s likely to keep hiking until pressures show more definitive signs of slowing. That\u2019s helped boost risk assets like the Nasdaq 100 stock index, which has gained for six straight days.\n\n\u201cCryptoassets performed well following the soft CPI print, suggesting that crypto\u2019s correlation to macro is not going away anytime soon,\u201d said Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat. \u201cThis week\u2019s follow-through in price action is certainly encouraging,\u201d and barring any forced liquidations from troubled crypto company DCG, \u201cthere is a high probability that the absolute bottom is in for crypto prices.\u201d\n\nThe price of Bitcoin was stuck in a narrow range around $16,000 to $17,000 for weeks before the latest breakout. The upward moves have caught shorts by surprise \u2014 crypto short liquidations have topped $100 million in five of the past six days, according to data from Coinglass. Saturday\u2019s total was the highest, topping $449 million.\n\nKatie Stockton, co-founder of Fairlead Strategies, offered a caution about the rally, which has taken Bitcoin above its 200-day moving average for the first time in a year.\n\n\u201cDeeply overbought short-term readings challenge positive momentum, so we would not chase the rally at these levels,\u201d she said in a note Friday. She sees resistance near $21,500, where there\u2019s a 61% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nStill, the upward trajectory could inject even further optimism into a market that\u2019s been struggling to find good news in recent months.\n\n\u201cDeclining CPI coupled with the announcement that the FTX liquidators have recovered $5 billion in liquid assets have given crypto markets plenty of factors to forget the macro picture, which is still bearish,\u201d said Hayden Hughes, chief executive officer of social-trading platform Alpha Impact. \u201cMarkets have plenty of positive momentum heading into the next FOMC meeting later this month.\u201d"

        "content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jake Cline is a writer and editor in Miami whose work has appeared in The Washington Post, The Atlantic and other national outlets. He was a member of the team that won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in Public Service for the South Florida Sun Sentinel\u2019s coverage of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThanks in large part to bitcoin evangelism by top officials in Miami, the city has spent the past couple of years in full-blown cryptomania.\n\nIn the vision of Mayor Francis Suarez \u2013 the city\u2019s chief cheerleader for digital currency \u2013 Miami will one day become the national capital for cryptocurrency.\n\nJake Cline Courtesy Jake Cline\n\nTwo years ago, Miami published its \u201cBitcoin White Paper\u201d \u2013 a blueprint for its transformation into a 21st century city. Around the same time, prominent crypto figures began relocating to the city, and Miami began hawking its own digital currency, MiamiCoin.\n\nAs the fever quickened, cryptocurrency exchanges began advertising on Miami billboards. Bitcoin ATMs were installed at neighborhood gas stations and convenience stores.\n\nAnd perhaps the most visible symbol allowing Miami to flex its crypto bragging rights was the announcement in March of 2021 by Miami-Dade County that it had sold naming rights for its main sports arena \u2013 home of the beloved Miami Heat NBA franchise \u2013 to FTX, the now bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange founded by disgraced crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nThat partnership, which is not even two years old, came to an unhappy end last week. On Wednesday, the beleaguered company and Miami\u2019s local government finalized an agreement to terminate the deal and remove the now tarnished FTX logo from the sports venue.\n\nOver the past few months, as the scale of Bankman-Fried\u2019s alleged fraud became clear, some city elders and the business community scrambled to unwind what many of us had suspected from the start was a simply terrible business deal. Bankman-Fried, who has maintained his innocence, pleaded not guilty to federal fraud charges during a court appearance in New York earlier this month.\n\nWe now know just what a fiasco Miami\u2019s love affair with crypto has been. The financial costs of last year\u2019s crypto crash have been enormous for the many thousands of investors who invested \u2013 and then lost funds they could ill afford to forgo.\n\nBut my own reservations were not rooted in certain knowledge that crypto would crumble, although its collapse was far swifter and more spectacular than even most skeptics anticipated.\n\nMy opposition to crypto is based on its deleterious effects on the environment. The fact that Miami, considered \u201cthe most vulnerable major coastal city in the world,\u201d would go all in for a currency created by a climate-wrecking technology always seemed to me to be a particular kind of madness.\n\nMany people don\u2019t understand how a currency that exists largely in the digital space can have real-life destructive impacts on our environment. Bitcoin mining uses vast amounts of resources. As the New Yorker\u2019s Elizabeth Kolbert wrote in an April 2021 article, \u201cbitcoin-mining operations worldwide now use \u2026 about the annual electricity consumption of the entire nation of Sweden.\u201d\n\nCiting data scientist Alex de Vries\u2019 Digiconomist website, Kolbert reported that \u201ca single bitcoin transaction uses the same amount of power that the average American household consumes in a month.\u201d Similar reporting could be found at The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN.\n\nBitcoin mining hardware has ramped up as the cryptocurrency\u2019s popularity has increased. Between January 1, 2016, and June 30, 2018, the mining operations for four major cryptocurrencies released an estimated three to 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to a study in the research journal Nature Sustainability.\n\nEven China, the world\u2019s largest polluter, banned bitcoin mining in 2021, citing its high carbon emissions. Now we are in what has been called \u201ccrypto winter\u201d after enthusiasm has plummeted for cryptocurrencies worldwide. Nevertheless, the carbon footprint of bitcoin, still the world\u2019s most valuable digital currency, continues to be enormous.\n\nThis past September, a report from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy found that crypto mining in the United States emits as much greenhouse gas as the nation\u2019s railroads and cautioned that \u201cdepending on the energy intensity of the technology used, crypto-assets could hinder broader efforts to achieve net-zero carbon pollution consistent with U.S. climate commitments and goals.\u201d\n\nBut despite all that data, Suarez remains convinced that it\u2019s possible to produce bitcoin in an environmentally friendly way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to sort of dispel some of the, I think, myths \u2014 I call them myths \u2014 of [crypto] mining as a not-environmentally-friendly activity,\u201d the mayor said during his Crypto Conference, a live-streamed event held in June 2021.\n\nAnd because there are renewable-energy sources in South Florida, his argument goes, crypto miners could eventually be incentivized to stop contributing to the destruction of our planet. He has argued, in effect, that because renewable energy sources exist, miners might just in the future opt to use them. It\u2019s an extraordinarily weak argument. It would be a wonderful outcome, if only we could interest bitcoin miners in abandoning their pursuit of cheap and dirty energy sources.\n\nBut he\u2019s not wrong \u2013 it is entirely possible to mine bitcoin responsibly, as bitcoin\u2019s leading competitor, ethereum, proved last year. A decentralized global network used for verifying billions of dollars of cryptocurrency transactions, ethereum in September completed a system-wide transformation known as the Merge.\n\nEssentially, ethereum moved to a mining process, known as proof of stake, that requires significantly less computing power than bitcoiners\u2019 preferred process, proof of work. In doing so, ethereum appears to have reduced its worldwide energy consumption by more than 99%.\n\nWhile some bitcoin miners say they want their industry to go green, the majority resist calls to adopt the proof of stake system over fears it would eat into their profits. Meanwhile, residents of Miami seem torn on environmental matters. According to a survey conducted by Yale University, as well as George Mason University, they believe that local officials, and state officials, including the governor \u201cshould do more to address global warming.\u201d\n\nBut Miami voters helped to propel a \u201cred wave\u201d that installed Republican supermajorities in both chambers of the Florida legislature \u2014 a body that under GOP control allows fossil-fuel companies to write its bills.\n\nResidents of Miami-Dade County this past November also voted to reelect Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has said that while he doesn\u2019t consider himself a \u201cclimate change denier\u201d he hopes never to be mistaken for a \u201cclimate change believer.\u201d\n\nAnd despite everything that has happened with the digital currency\u2019s plummeting value, Suarez, who is also president of the United States Conference of Mayors, remains a bitcoin believer.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\u2019s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMiami-Dade County will once again play host later this year to Bitcoin 2023, the next installment of the annual conference. And Suarez told a Miami TV station that he continues to receive his government salary in bitcoin, as he has since November 2021.\n\nSome dreams, it would seem, die hard."

        "content": "Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of American business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, has shared what he thinks will happen to bitcoin (BTC) in the next eight years while outlining how it will come into play.\n\nIn a recent interview with Cory Klippsten, the founder and CEO of Swan Bitcoin, Saylor noted that he sees bitcoin becoming a global store of value by 2031.\n\nInstitutional Adoption\n\nAccording to him, institutional adoption is one of the first drivers of the digital asset\u2019s global store of value status in the coming years. The bitcoin proponent believes institutional adoption is possible through the \u201cutterances\u201d of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and decisions by traditional financial institutions.\n\nSaylor mentioned some traditional financial institutions, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, that are beginning to embrace bitcoin in recent times due to its potential despite previously distancing themselves from the asset.\n\nThe Explosion of Lightning Network\n\nThe MicroStrategy co-founder also cited the explosive growth of the Lightning Network as another factor that will make the digital asset a global store of value.\n\nThe Lightning Network is a layer-2 solution built on the bitcoin protocol to make transactions faster and cheaper. Interestingly, MicroStrategy plans to develop applications powered by the Lightning Network that could reach millions of users.\n\nAccording to Saylor, developing \u201ckiller apps\u201d like Lightning Wallets that move digital dollars and BTC and swaps in and out of local currency will create massive demand for the asset.\n\n\u201cI just describe this as in 1991, you had TCP IP, and we had the internet, but not many people used it. In 1994, you had the Netscape browser, and now that was the killer app for the internet, and pretty soon you had 100 million people download that browser and it caught fire,\u201d he said.\n\nMacroeconomic Headwinds\n\nThe billionaire also noted that macroeconomic headwinds, such as the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes, are major factors that will help bitcoin achieve a global store of value status.\n\nTo tame inflation, the Fed raised the federal funds rate seven times in 2022, with more expected to happen this year. Saylor stated that inflation would increase once the Fed reduces its interest rate hikes which will be a marketing driver for the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to the MicroStrategy executive chairman, the combination of these factors will \u201cplay out against the new reality: bitcoin is the only digital commodity, it is the only crypto asset, and there is no second best crypto asset.\u201d"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Jumped Over 10% in the Last 24 Hours - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nThe cryptocurrency market suddenly came to life on Friday night for the first time since FTX collapsed in early November. Nearly every asset was up big, and some with ties to FTX are significantly higher.\n\nBitcoin (BTC 2.53%) jumped 10.9% and is trading at $20,909 at 8 a.m. ET, surpassing the $20,000 level for the first time since FTX became insolvent in early November. Ethereum (ETH 1.92%) is up 10.1% in the last day to $1,540 and Solana (SOL 1.36%) is the big mover, popping 36.1% to $22.53. Over the past week, the cryptocurrencies are up 23.2%, 21.5%, and 69.9%, respectively.\n\nSo what\n\nMomentum can be a powerful force in cryptocurrencies, especially on the weekend. Trading on weekends often leads to some of the biggest moves, as traders take time off and there's less liquidity (buyers and sellers) in the market.\n\nFueling some of the moves is liquidations of short positions. According to coinglass.com, $730 million of short positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours with $240 million of that being in Bitcoin, $261 million in Ethereum, and $26.3 million of Solana short trades.\n\nThe two macro news items this week were inflation data that showed a reduction in prices over the past month, leading to speculation the Federal Reserve will soon stop raising rates and may even be forced to lower rates sooner than expected. This pushed growth stocks and high-risk assets higher this week, but the momentum really hit crypto hard on Friday evening into Saturday morning.\n\nSince FTX got us here, it may in part be FTX that has driven the rally. By that, I mean that liquidators of FTX's assets have recovered $5 billion in assets to return to customers and they've been selling leveraged positions as quickly as possible. That added selling pressure to a market with lower liquidity, and when added to the short positions this can drop prices. But when they slow selling and short positions get liquidated (as they have today), the bounce higher can be swift.\n\nNow what\n\nThe price of cryptocurrencies fundamentally comes down to supply and demand. Supply isn't rising very quickly, so demand is the key. When FTX collapsed and the crypto winter wore on, many investors and traders either gave up on the market or took short positions to take advantage of weakness. But over time there should be more and more users of the blockchain, helped lately by significant corporate interest.\n\nI think the long-term trend for cryptocurrencies is still higher, but the volatility seen over the last two months will continue. There needs to be more use cases that disrupt old businesses or create new businesses, and that's when mass adoption will come. That's why Solana is my top cryptocurrency long term, given its low costs and high speed. But a rising tide lifts all boats, and bullishness on crypto overall is helping everything trade higher today."

        "content": "In the beginning, Bitcoin was one whole protocol and wasn\u2019t divided in any way. But as the network expanded and demand from the market piled on it, the Bitcoin development team began to notice certain things.\n\nThe first thing that the community noticed was that Bitcoin went through transactions slowly. The network cannot process more than five to seven transactions per second. While that wasn\u2019t a massive issue in the earlier days, it soon became a huge problem.\n\nThere was no way Bitcoin would compete with the likes of Visa and MasterCard if it took days for transactions on the network to be approved.\n\nThe solution proposed by some to solve this problem was to create a hard fork. This meant that the protocols running the Bitcoin network would change, and a fundamentally different network would be created. This new network would be quicker and faster than the regular Bitcoin, making adoption easier.\n\nHowever, this proposal created a huge rift in the crypto ecosystem. A group of developers, Bitcoin activists, and Chinese miners supported Bitcoin, while others preferred a smaller block limit for Bitcoin, keeping it roughly at the same speed.\n\nThis disagreement turned into a hard fork on the Bitcoin network. The new chain arriving from the fork was Bitcoin Cash, and the two communities separated. Since then, the value of Bitcoin Cash has fallen drastically while the value of Bitcoin has risen dramatically.\n\nAccording to a few people, Blockstream, one of the biggest companies in the crypto ecosystem, was behind the failed fork. These theorists claim that Blockstream put its weight behind the original Bitcoin network because it didn\u2019t want to create a scalable Bitcoin protocol. The theorists claim that Blockstream did this because it wanted to retain control over Bitcoin and stop it from going mainstream."

        "content": "Bitcoin has broken $21,000.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko data, BTC was valued at $21,083 at 12:59 a.m. UTC on Jan. 14. Its market cap was $403 billion. That change represents a 12% increase in 24 hours.\n\nData also shows that $245 million of shorts have been liquidated over the past 24 hours, while $255 million of Bitcoin was bought on spot markets today.\n\nThere are no major events that could have had an obvious positive effect on investor activity. Rather, changing investor sentiment may be due to a lack of bad news \u2014 and due to the fact that major crises like FTX\u2019s collapse are fading into the past.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s gains today represent ongoing growth over the past several days. This week, positive anticipation and sentiment toward a Consumer Price Index (CPI) announcement appeared to contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s price growth.\n\nThe round number of $20,000 also represents a psychological barrier, and as such, investors may be optimistic now that Bitcoin has crossed it.\n\nBitcoin typically leads the crypto market, and its performance today contributed to the crypto market\u2019s overall growth. The entire crypto market cap was up 8% over the past 24 hours, and it now has a market cap of $1.02 trillion.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and the entire crypto market outperformed the stock market today. The Dow Jones was up 0.3% today, while the S&P 500 was up 0.4%.\n\nHowever, some altcoins have seen modest growth compared to Bitcoin. Ethereum was up 9.8%, while XRP, BNB, and Polygon each gained close to 6%. It remains to be seen whether the crypto market will continue to trend upward."

        "title": "How I Introduced My Younger Sister To Bitcoin - Nasdaq",
        "content": "For my sister\u2019s eighteenth birthday, I gave her the gift of bitcoin and some lessons on becoming a sovereign individual.\n\nThis is an opinion editorial by Santiago Varela, a bitcoin miner and writer from Mexico City.\n\nMy sister turned 18 years old in the beginning of 2023 and I gave her a very unusual gift during this holiday season. Because I love her, I truly believe that the best gift I can give her is the orange pill.\n\nIt all started with a letter that I wrote for her explaining the gift I was about to give her. Then, I handed her a copy of \u201cThe Bitcoin Standard\u201d by Saifedean Ammous and a hardware wallet. However, that was just the beginning of a long process that we had to go through together if I really wanted to orange pill her.\n\nOf course, I was well aware that her first reaction to my surprise wasn't going to include the typical face of an 18-year-old girl opening her presents on a joyful Christmas morning. At first, she seemed more confused than excited. I have no doubt that she was expecting some nice pair of shoes or a cool gadget. I'm sorry sis, but that's how we maximalists roll.\n\nIn the birthday/holiday letter, I pointed out three reasons why I was giving her this specific gift:\n\nI want to set her on the path to financial freedom I want her to be a sovereign woman in a fiat world where dishonest relationships have been normalized As a high school senior who doesn't know what she wants to study in college, she could benefit from Bitcoin which might give her some ideas for what she wants to do\n\nThe long process of orange pilling my sister began with a quote from the prologue of \u201cThe Bitcoin Standard,\u201d which I consider the perfect starting point. I asked her to read this quote over and over again before beginning the orange-pilling journey:\n\n\u201cThis book does not offerinvestment advice but aims at helping elucidate the economic properties of the network and its operation, to provide readers an informed understanding of bitcoin before deciding whether they want to use it. Only with such an understanding, and only after extensive and thorough research into the practical operational aspects of owning and storing bitcoins, should anyone consider holding value in bitcoin. While bitcoin\u00b4s rise in market value may make it appear like a no-brainer as an investment, a closer look at the myriad hacks, attacks, scams, and security failures that have cost people their bitcoins provides a sobering warning to anyone who thinks that owning bitcoins provides a guaranteed profit. Should you come out of reading this book thinking that the bitcoin currency is something worth owning, your first investment should not be in buying bitcoins, but in time spent understanding how to buy, store, and own bitcoins securely. It is the inherent nature of bitcoin that such knowledge cannot be delegated or outsourced. There is no alternative to personal responsibility for anyone interested in using this network, and that is the real investment that needs to be made to get into bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, I told her that I would help her set up the hardware wallet and I would send her a little bit of bitcoin. To begin, I sent her $10 worth of bitcoin. But then, to make sure that she invested time into acquiring the basic, necessary knowledge and to make her understand the proof-of-work philosophy, I promised that I would send her $100 worth of bitcoin for every chapter of the book that she read. Therefore, I prepared a quiz for each chapter to verify that she really read carefully.\n\nHowever, as someone who is deep down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, I knew that making her read the book to stack sats on her hardware wallet wasn't enough. That was nothing, we were just getting started. So, what was next in the orange-pilling journey? Every time that I crossed by any opportunity, I tried to convert that moment into a little Bitcoin lesson.\n\nFor example, there was such an opportunity after my sister was assigned a project in her high school philosophy class. Knowing that I am a big fan of philosophy, she came to ask me for help. The project consisted of having a conversation with one of your family members but using the famous Socratic method for the conversation. If you don't know what that is, the Socratic method (named after Socrates) is \u201ca form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions.\u201d\n\nObviously, we had a dialogue about Bitcoin and money using the Socratic method.\n\nAnother thing I did in this orange-pilling journey was to show her a rabbit hole inside of the Bitcoin rabbit hole: bitcoin mining and energy. I love bitcoin mining and the energy aspects of Bitcoin. In fact, I love it so much that we have an ASIC in our garage. It wasn't really hard to make her grasp how passionate I am about home mining. Believe it or not, she had never even seen my ASIC (she had only heard the \u201cbrrrrrr\u201d). Consequently, I took her to the garage and she got some hands-on experience. I also have my Bitcoin and Lightning nodes in the garage. That was a lot of fun because with tools like Mempool.Space and LnVisualizer I was able to help her see the tangible side of Bitcoin. This is when I really felt that it all began to come together.\n\nAs you all likely know, knowledge about Bitcoin can\u2019t be delegated or outsourced. When it comes to Bitcoin, there is no alternative to personal responsibility. Although I\u2019ve told her that I\u2019d love to help her with anything, I can\u2019t guide her down the rabbit hole forever. You have to go down the Bitcoin rabbit hole by yourself. I guided her for a long time but the moment for her to embark on the journey for herself is here. Like Oscar Wilde once said: \u201cEducation is an admirable thing. But it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.\u201d\n\nSo, I began treating her like any other Bitcoin pleb out there and let her go down the rabbit hole by herself. The only thing I did was to send her a bunch of resources (articles, podcasts, videos, books, etc.) and let her go her own way. At the same time, I realized that I could do this with other kids that are about the same age as my sister. Even better, I realized that my sister could help me with this and introduce her digital-native friends to Bitcoin because, if you care about Bitcoin, you should onboard people individually.\n\nAccordingly, I\u2019ve decided to turn our garage into a little Bitcoin academy. Although my sister was the guinea pig for this experiment (and, as I am writing, she is the only student that has attended Bitcoin academy), I have to give a big shout out to other Bitcoiners around the world who have shared educational content for anyone to use. For example, Mi Primer Bitcoin (from El Salvador) has an amazing Bitcoin diploma workbook that anyone can download for free. I have no doubt that initiatives like theirs or like Escuelita Bitcoin in Uruguay are what we need if we want a future with sovereign individuals. We need to teach the young.\n\nHopefully, this inspires other Bitcoiners around the world to introduce their younger siblings to Bitcoin. I was inspired by initiatives like the ones mentioned above and by stories like the Denver middle schoolers who became Bitcoin entrepreneurs. With a little bit of luck, the next time I write an article for Bitcoin Magazine, it\u2019ll be about Mexico City middle schoolers who became Bitcoin entrepreneurs. For now, stay humble and stack sats my friends.\n\nThis is a guest post by Santiago Varela.

        "content": "For the first time since early November, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency industry exceeded $1 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nOn January 14, Bitcoin increased to over $21,000 on hopes that inflation may have peaked and reached a bottom. The biggest cryptocurrency increased up to 7.5% to $21,299 in value. Since November 8 it hadn't been above $20,000, and January 14 was its 11th straight day of growth. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, rose up to 9.7%, and other coins like Cardano and Dogecoin also registered significant gains.\n\nBefore this most recent breakout, the price of Bitcoin had been trapped in a small range between $16,000 and $17,000 for weeks. The rising movements have surprised shorts; according to statistics from Coinglass, cryptocurrency short liquidations have exceeded $100 million in five of the last six days. The biggest amount was reached on January 14 and exceeded $296 million.\n\nThe increases coincided with consumer pricing data released last week that indicated a decline in inflation from December levels to January levels. Following that additional cooling, the Federal Reserve is on course to transition to smaller interest-rate rises, but it's expected to keep doing so until price pressures show more certain indications of moderating. Risky assets, such as the Nasdaq 100 stock index, which has increased for six days in a row, have benefited from this.\n\nFollowing the soft CPI print, cryptoassets fared nicely, indicating that the correlation between crypto and macro is not about to disappear any time soon, as per Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat. The price action that has continued this week is undoubtedly positive, and barring any forced liquidations by the financially challenged crypto business DCG, there is a strong likelihood that the absolute bottom has been reached for cryptocurrency pricing.\n\nThe macroeconomic environment, which is still gloomy, has been overshadowed by the declining CPI and the news that the FTX liquidators had recovered $5 billion in cash assets, as per Hayden Hughes, chief executive officer of social-trading platform Alpha Impact. Going into the upcoming FOMC meeting later this month, the markets are moving strongly in the right direction, he added.\n\n(With Bloomberg inputs)\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "content": "The cryptocurrency markets have made a strong comeback in the past few days. That drove the total crypto market capitalization to $995 billion on Jan. 14, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin (BTC) led the recovery from the front, skyrocketing above $21,000 on Jan. 14.\n\nAfter the sharp rally, the big question is whether the recovery is a dead cat bounce that is a selling opportunity, or the start of a new uptrend. It is difficult to predict with certainty if a macro bottom has been made but the charts suggest that a bottoming process has begun.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nIndependent market analyst HornHairs highlighted that the 2017 to 2018 bear market lasted for 364 days and that from 2021 to the current market low, the duration is again 364 days. Another interesting similarity is that the 2015 to 2017 bull market and the 2018 to 2021 bull phase both lasted for 1,064 days. If history repeats itself, then Bitcoin may make the next top in roughly 1,000 days.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s short-term price action has been exciting for bulls but are there altcoins that are showing similar strength in the near term?\n\nLet\u2019s study the charts to find out.\n\nBTC/USDT\n\nBitcoin shot up to $21,258 on Jan. 13 and that propelled the relative strength index (RSI) above 89, signaling that the rally was overheated in the short term. The bears are expected to mount a strong defense at $21,500.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSometimes, when a trend change happens, the RSI may remain in the overbought territory for a long time. If the BTC/USDT pair does not give up much ground from the current level, it will suggest that traders are in no hurry to book profits as they anticipate another leg higher.\n\nIf buyers kick the price above $21,500, the pair could climb to $22,800. This level may again act as a major roadblock.\n\nOn the way down, the bears will have to drag the price below the psychological level of $20,000 to make a dent in the bullish momentum. The pair could then slump to the breakout level of $18,388.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are guarding the $21,250 level but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to slide back below $20,000. Buyers may again attempt to clear the overhead hurdle at $21,258 and resume the uptrend.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price once again turns down from $21,250, it may tempt short-term traders to book profits. That could sink the pair below the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). The bears may try to capitalize on this situation and pull the pair to $18,388.\n\nLTC/USDT\n\nLitecoin (LTC) broke above the overhead resistance at $85 on Jan. 12, indicating the start of a new uptrend. There is no major hurdle until the price reaches $107.\n\nLTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nOn the downside, the bulls will try to fiercely defend the zone between $85 and the 20-day EMA ($79). If the price springs back from this zone, the LTC/USDT pair could continue its uptrend and reach $107.\n\nThe upsloping moving averages signal advantage to bulls but the RSI above 77 suggests that a minor pullback or consolidation is likely.\n\nIf bears want to gain the upper hand, they will have to pull the price below the breakout level of $75. That could make way for a collapse to $61.\n\nLTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows the pair is in an uptrend and the bulls are fiercely protecting the 20-EMA. If buyers drive the price above $92, the pair could pick up momentum and rally toward the psychological level of $100.\n\nConversely, if the price turns down and dives below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that short-term traders may be booking profits. That could pull the price to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it could heighten the risk of a drop to $80 and then $75.\n\nOKB/USDT\n\nWhile several cryptocurrencies are attempting to bottom out, OKB (OKB) has started a new uptrend. Usually, it is a good strategy to buy the dips in an uptrend by keeping a suitable stop loss.\n\nOKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory indicate that bulls are in command but a short-term consolidation or correction can't be ruled out. The OKB/USDT pair could slip to the 20-day EMA ($27.64), which is likely to act as strong support.\n\nIf the price rebounds off this level, the pair could touch the strong overhead barrier at $34.18. Crossing this level may be a difficult task but if the bulls manage to achieve it, the pair could skyrocket to $42.\n\nIf bears want to stall the up-move, they will have to yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plummet to the 50-day SMA ($24.05).\n\nOKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the uptrend met with strong selling near $33 and the pair could correct to the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off this support, it will suggest that bulls are buying on every minor dip. That could drive the price to $34.18.\n\nContrarily, if the price plunges below the 20-EMA, the correction could deepen to the 50-SMA. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will again try to resume the up-move but may face resistance at $31 and again near $33.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin fails to convince that bottom is in with $12K 'still likely'\n\nBIT/USDT\n\nBitDAO (BIT) rallied sharply from $0.26 on Dec. 27 to $0.53 on Jan. 14, indicating a strong bullish momentum. In addition, the shallow pullback on Jan. 15 suggests that traders are not exiting their positions in a hurry as they anticipate the up-move to continue.\n\nBIT/USDT daily chart.

The bears may pose a strong challenge at this level because a break and close above it could open the doors for a possible rally to $0.80.\n\nOn the downside, the first support is at $0.46 and then the 20-day EMA ($0.42). A strong bounce off either support will suggest that traders are buying on declines. That could result in a retest of $0.54. The bears may take control if they sink the price below the 20-day EMA.\n\nBIT/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair is facing resistance near $0.54 but the bulls are likely to defend the drop to the 20-EMA. A strong rebound off this level will suggest that bulls are buying on shallow declines. That could improve the prospects of a break above $0.54.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, several short-term traders may book profits. That could pull the pair to the 50-SMA. If this level also cracks, the pair could tumble to $0.41.\n\nFTM/USDT\n\nFantom (FTM) broke above the downtrend line on Jan. 9, indicating a potential trend change. The breakout was followed by a sharp rally which pushed the RSI into deeply overbought levels.\n\nFTM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nVertical rallies are unsustainable, hence a pullback was to be expected. The FTM/USDT pair could dip to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.30 and then to the 50% retracement level of $0.28.\n\nIf the price turns up from this zone, it will suggest a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. The bulls will then try to resume the recovery and drive the pair above $0.36. If they do that, the pair could surge to $0.42.\n\nContrarily, a break and close below $0.28 could pull the pair down to the 61.8% retracement level of $0.26. A deeper fall could break the bullish momentum and increase the possibility of a range formation.\n\nFTM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating an advantage to buyers. The pair could slide to the 20-EMA, which is likely to act as a strong support. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will try to resume the up-move.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price breaks below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that traders are aggressively booking profits after the recent rally. The pair could then extend its correction to the 50-SMA.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "In one of its most impressive rallies in about a year, bitcoin skyrocketed by double digits, charting a two-month high above $21,000.\n\nMost alternative coins have followed suit, resulting in over $650 million in liquidations on a 24-hour scale, the majority of which were from short positions.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that the start of the year has been quite favorable for the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, for one, stood around $16,500 on January 1. After a quiet first few days, it began to add value and broke above $17,000 earlier this week.\n\nHowever, that was just the start, as the asset kept breaking into forgotten ground in the following days and finally reached $20,000 late last night.\n\nIt continued climbing and jumped to $21,240 (on Bitstamp) for the first time since the FTX collapse unfolded at the beginning of November.\n\nSeveral altcoins have skyrocketed even more in the past 24 hours. Solana has stolen the show with a massive 40% rally, driving it to a multi-month high of its own at above $23.\n\nPolkadot (20%), Shiba Inu (14%), Ethereum (10.5%), Cardano (11%), Dogecoin (11%), Polygon (10%), and OKB (10%) are just some of the examples of double-digit price gainers.\n\nThis has resulted in the overall crypto market cap nearing $1 trillion for the first time in months on CoinMarketCap.\n\nShort traders have felt the pain of this impressive rally, according to CoinGlass. The total value of liquidated positions in the past day stands at $650 million, but $590 million are from shorts.\n\nMore than 110,000 traders have been wrecked in the same timeframe, with the largest single order happening on Huobi, which was worth over $6.5 million."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has kicked off 2023 with a blast attaining several key support levels that investors will be hoping can build the base for the maiden cryptocurrency to rally further. The bullish momentum has come with investors capitalizing on the positive macroeconomic news to pump more capital into the asset.\n\nIn this line, Bitcoin has witnessed an inflow of over $73 billion within seven days amid sustained buying pressure. By the time of publishing on January 15, Bitcoin controlled a market cap of $399.1 billion, representing an increase of about 22% from $326.1 billion registered on January 8.\n\nBitcoin seven-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nIndeed, the value of Bitcoin is benefiting from the increased capital inflow, with the asset trading at $20.886, having rallied over 22% in seven days. On the weekly chart, BTC peaked above $21,000 on January 14. Notably, Bitcoin\u2019s momentum has translated to one of the extended winning streaks for the asset in almost two years.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nCPI data triggers Bitcoin capital inflow\n\nBitcoin\u2019s sustained capital inflows highlight the boost in crypto markets after the United States\u2019 latest consumer price index (CPI) for December, which hit 6.5% on an annual basis.\n\nThe reporting has been interpreted as a sign that the Federal Reserve is winning the battle to slow down inflation. This factor translates to the possibility of risky assets like Bitcoin not facing further effects of a stiff monetary-policy tightening pressure.\n\nWith Bitcoin having witnessed bullish momentum recently and reversing the general effects of the FTX crash, investors are still wondering where the asset\u2019s price could head next. Indeed, the main point of concern is whether the bear market is over or not.\n\nCan Bitcoin sustain recent gains?\n\nInvestors still need to observe caution, considering Bitcoin is still facing bearish sentiments that could reverse the current gains. For example, cryptocurrency entities are yet to recover from the effects of the macroeconomic environment, announcing a series of layoffs alongside the possibility of the U.S. forming a House sub-committee on cryptocurrencies.\n\nFurthermore, based on the general market mood tracked by the Fear and Greed Index, the crypto sector appears to be moving towards optimism. The index aligns with the \u2018neutral\u2019 sentiment barely a day after languishing in the \u2018fear\u2019 zone.\n\nCrypto Fear and Greed Index. Source: Alternative.me\n\nAt the same time, crypto trading expert and analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe pointed out that Bitcoin is still facing key events likely to impact the current rally. In a YouTube video posted on January 13, he said investors should look out for data that affect general economic health, such as retail sales.\n\nHe further warned that despite the inflation data slowing down, the Fed can still hike rates if the overall economic health is low, an element that could affect the buying power.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "SBF denies stealing FTX assets, SEC charges Gemini and Genesis, and more: Hodler's Digest: Jan. 8-14 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\nSam Bankman-Fried: \u2018I didn\u2019t steal funds, and I certainly didn\u2019t stash billions away.\u2019\n\nIn a \u201cpre-mortem overview\u201d of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy, Sam Bankman-Fried denied allegations of improper use of customer funds stored with the crypto exchange, attributing responsibility for the company\u2019s dramatic fall to the market crash of 2022 and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao\u2019s PR campaign against FTX. In Bankman-Fried\u2019s view, a run on the bank turned illiquidity issues into insolvency. Among the latest developments in the bankruptcy proceedings, a bipartisan group of United States senators criticized one of the law firms involved in the case on the grounds of a conflict of interest, and called on the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware to appoint an independent examiner into FTX\u2019s activities. Also in the week\u2019s headlines, FTX attorney Andy Dietderich said the company has recovered $5 billion in cash and liquid cryptocurrencies.\n\nGemini and Genesis charged by SEC with selling unregistered securities\n\nCrypto firms Genesis Global Capital and Gemini were charged by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with offering unregistered securities through Gemini\u2019s Earn program. Genesis and Gemini partnered on the product in 2020, offering customers the chance to loan crypto with the promise of later repayment with interest. The SEC stated that the Gemini Earn program constitutes an offer and sale of securities, and should have been registered with the commission. Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, said the SEC\u2019s action was \u201ctotally counterproductive,\u201d and noted that Gemini had been discussing the Earn program with the regulator \u201cfor more than 17 months.\u201d.\n\nDCG owes creditors over $3B, considering $500M VC portfolio sale\n\nIt has been a difficult week for Genesis Global Trading and its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), as reports revealed that Genesis allegedly owes its creditors more than $3 billion. To offset the shortfall, DCG, which also owns Grayscale Investments, seeks to sell part of its venture capital holdings with more than 200 crypto-related projects, including crypto exchanges, banks and custodians in at least 35 countries, totaling around $500 million in valuation.\n\nEl Salvador passes landmark crypto bill, paving way for Bitcoin-backed bonds\n\nOn Jan. 11, El Salvador passed the landmark Digital Assets Issuance law that establishes the legal framework to issue Bitcoin-backed bonds to pay down sovereign debt and fund the construction of a so-called \u201cBitcoin City.\u201d The bonds are expected to raise $1 billion for the country, half of which will be used to build the special economic zone. The legislation also creates a regulatory body and establishes a legal framework for all digital assets in the country.\n\nAbu Dhabi-based Venom Foundation launches $1B fund for Web3 and blockchain\n\nVenom Foundation, an Abu Dhabi-based blockchain platform, and Iceberg Capital announced a new partnership that will allocate $1 billion to Web3 and blockchain companies, including decentralized applications focused on payments, asset management, decentralized finance and GameFi products and services. The investment fund will look to attract startups and technology firms to use Venom\u2019s proof-of-stake-based blockchain solution.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $19,297, Ether (ETH) at $1,418 and XRP at $0.37. The total market cap is at $916.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAmong the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Gala (GALA) at 125.9%, Aptos (APT) at 77.52% and Optimism (OP) at 45.28%.\n\nThe top three altcoin losers of the week are Fei USD (FEI) at -2.53%, Nexo (NEXO) at -2.29% and UNUS SED LEO (LEO) at 0.07%.\n\n\n\nFor more info on crypto prices, make sure to read Cointelegraph\u2019s market analysis.\n\nMost Memorable Quotations\n\n\u201cThere are still some overhangs \u2014 DCG and Genesis and Gemini \u2014 that will play out in the next quarter. That\u2019s not going to be great.\u201d\n\nMike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings\n\n\u201cHistory tells us there\u2019s not much room for micro currencies, meaning, you know, we have the U.S. dollar and Europe has the euro and the like.\u201d\n\nGary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n\n\u201cAs long as there is interest in the crypto market, the number of hackers will not decrease.\u201d\n\nTommy Deng, managing director of Beosin\n\n\u201cPeople talk about the [Bitcoin] problem of volatility, but this is nothing when you live in a place where your money could easily lose half its value in a year.\u201d\n\nMegasley, Nigeria\u2019s first Lightning node runner\n\n\u201cThere is no path forward as long as Barry Silbert remains CEO of DCG.\u201d\n\nCameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a political act and not a financial gesture. Like those who grow mustaches in November to fight prostate cancer. I put this salary in Bitcoin on a cold wallet every month and I haven\u2019t touched it.\u201d\n\nChristophe De Beukelaer, Belgian lawmaker\n\nPrediction of the Week\n\nBitcoin price wants to retest 2017 all-time high near $20K\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has jumped in recent days and sits near $19,000 at the end of this week, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.\n\n\n\nOn-chain analytics resource Material Indicators predicts there could be a retest of the $20,000 mark. \u201cSeems like BTC is setting up for a retest of resistance at the 2017 Top,\u201d it wrote on Twitter.\n\nAccording to the analytics firm, \u201cwhether we see a bonafide breakout or fakeout remains to be seen. Time for patience and discipline.\u201d\n\nFUD of the Week\n\nNexo offices reportedly raided by police in Bulgaria\n\nBulgarian regulators are increasing pressure on cryptocurrency lender Nexo, after a group of prosecutors, investigators and foreign agents searched the company\u2019s offices in the Bulgarian capital city of Sofia on Jan. 12. The operation was initiated a few months ago, targeting a large-scale financial criminal scheme allegedly involving money laundering and violations of international sanctions against Russia. Nexo has complained about the actions of the law enforcement authorities and is preparing to file a lawsuit against authorities to seek compensation for damages caused by the abrupt police interruption.\n\nScam alert: MetaMask warns crypto users about address poisoning\n\nDigital wallet provider MetaMask warned users of an \u201caddress poisoning scam,\u201d where attackers \u201cpoison\u201d transaction histories. The attack does not allow hackers to access user\u2019s wallets, but those who have become habitual about copying their wallet addresses from transaction histories could potentially send funds to copycat addresses.\n\nCrypto.\u200bcom CEO announces 20% staff cut, \u2018did not account\u2019 for FTX collapse\n\nA new wave of staff layoffs has been announced by crypto exchange Crypto.com, which will reduce its global workforce by 20% following \u201crecent industry events.\u201d Also fighting to survive the bear market, Coinbase is closing most of its Japanese operations as part of a restructuring plan that aims to reduce 20% of the exchange staff..\n\nBest Cointelegraph Features\n\n\u2018Deflation\u2019 is a dumb way to approach tokenomics\u2026 and other sacred cows\n\nNovelty token designs might attract some brief interest, but projects need to learn the principles of sustainable tokenomics..\n\nYour guide to crypto in Toronto: Crypto City\n\nThe \u201chome\u201d of Ethereum and the home town of Vitalik Buterin, Toronto embraced digital assets sooner than most and is home to more crypto projects than anywhere else in Canada.\n\nCrypto layoffs mount as exchanges continue to be ravaged by the prevailing bear market\n\nMany popular cryptocurrency trading platforms, including Kraken and Coinbase, have recently initiated a fresh round of firings."

        "content": "BTC whales intensified accumulation in the last eight weeks.\n\nOpen Interest and Funding Rates revealed that investors harbored bullish sentiments.\n\nIncreased whale activity since the commencement of the new trading year has led to a 26% growth in the price of Bitcoin [BTC], as per a 14 January tweet from Santiment.\n\n? Amongst many of the foreshadowing metrics for this 2023 breakout was the rapidly growing amount of addresses holding 100 to 1,000 $BTC. Price pumps generally occur marketwide when whales accumulate #Bitcoin. The #1 asset in #crypto is +26% in two weeks. https://t.co/JMh83m3mIu pic.twitter.com/FiRTLIc3LB \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 14, 2023\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nBitcoin whales show their strength\n\nAccording to the on-chain data provider, the count of BTC whales holding 100 \u2013 1,000 BTCs rallied by over 3% in the last two months. At press time, the count of this cohort stood at 14,110 whale addresses.\n\nWhen whales intensified the accumulation of a crypto asset, it often created a positive sentiment among other investors. This leads to an increase in demand for the asset, which can, in turn, drive up its prices.\n\nFurther, BTC\u2019s Open Interest has been rallying since the year started. Per data from Coinglass, the king coin\u2019s Open Interest has grown by 13% since 1 January 2023.\n\nOpen interest refers to the number of outstanding contracts, or positions, that have not yet been settled. An increase in open interest suggested that more traders and investors were entering trading positions on the asset. This is often regarded as a sign of increased demand for the asset, which precedes a price rally.\n\nLikewise, funding rates on the BTC network since 2023 have been positive, data from CryptoQuant showed.\n\nFor example, despite the FTX debacle in November 2022 and the consequential decline in BTC\u2019s value, traders were undeterred and continued to take long positions.\n\nKeep this at the back of your mind\n\nCryptoQuant analyst Inspocrypto found that BTC logged the highest spot inflow on 13 January, which showed that holders of 1000 to 10,000 BTC had resumed sending their holdings to exchanges.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s BTC market cap in ETH\u2019s terms\n\nWhile the increase in an asset\u2019s exchange inflow is often regarded as a bearish sign, it could also mean that the asset is becoming more liquid and easier to trade, which can be positive for the market.\n\nOn where BTC\u2019s price might go next, Inspocrypto opined,\n\n\u201cFor bulls, the range between 19k \u2013 19.2k is key. If they break that range and maintain above, we can go further, heading 23k \u2013 24k. Otherwise, we will retest 15.6k and trade lower levels below 15k.\u201d\n\nFurther, on what BTC holders should expect, another CryptoQuant analyst, TariqDabil, while assessing BTC\u2019s Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) said,"

        "content": "The crypto market rallied significantly in the last 24 hours.\n\nShort traders have seen the most liquidation.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization grew by over 5%, per data from CoinGecko.\n\nFor the first time post-FTX collapse, Bitcoin [BTC] traded above the $21,000 price mark, while leading altcoin Ethereum [ETH] changed hands at $1,600, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nAlso, sharing a statistically significant positive correlation with BTC, layer one coin Cardano [ADA] and leading meme coin Shiba Inu [SHIB] also logged price jumps of 4% and 6%, respectively, within the same time frame.\n\nAccording to data from the crypto analytics platform Coinglass, liquidations across the cryptocurrency market in the last 24 hours totaled $719.05 million, with 131,575 traders liquidated.\n\nHowever, the recent rally has had a particularly negative impact on short traders. In the last 24 hours, liquidated short positions represented 62% of total market liquidations, data from Coinglass showed.\n\nWhy the greens?\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that the crypto and traditional finance markets share a close correlation. The recent rally in the crypto market could be attributable to the fact that all major indexes closed the just-concluded trading week on a positive note for the first time since November.\n\nOn 13 January, after starting the day by booking significant losses, all major indexes managed to recover and close in the green. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 0.33%. The S&P 500 also rose by 0.40% to 3,999.09, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.71% to reach 11,079.16.\n\nAccording to CNBC, the recent rally resulted in the S&P and Nasdaq both having their second consecutive positive week and best weekly performance since November. The Nasdaq had the highest weekly increase at 4.82%. The S&P and Dow also saw gains of 2.67% and 2%, respectively.\n\nA bull trap or nay?\n\nA pseudonymous crypto analyst on Twitter CryptoCapo opined that while the market might have logged unprecedented gains in the last 24 hours, the possibility of registering new lows was not completely invalidated.\n\nGood morning. Market is bouncing more than expected, that is a certainty. Now\u2026 is the bearish scenario invalidated? I'm going to explain why I think new lows are still likely. \u2014 il Capo Of Crypto (@CryptoCapo_) January 14, 2023\n\nAccording to CryptoCapo, an assessment of BTC, ETH, and other altcoins on a high time revealed that the jump in price in the last 24 hours caused these crypto assets to test major resistance levels. However, \u201cthere\u2019s no bullish confirmation yet,\u201d CryptoCapo said.\n\nHe assessed BTC on a lower time frame and said:\n\n\u201c$BTC is in a ltf (lower time frame) parabolic move.

This metric is important for assessing Bitcoin adoption levels since, for most users, the first step in entering the cryptocurrency world is to purchase an initial amount on an online exchange platform.\n\nMajor exchanges internationally have just released their year-end reports, which include updated information on the growth of their user base. We report below, for each exchange considered, the respective user base at the end of 2021 and at the end of 2022, as well as the growth rate for the year considered:\n\nCoinbase\n\nIn December 2021 it had 73 million verified users. Over the next twelve months, its user base grew by 48% to 108 million. To date, Coinbase represents the second largest crypto exchange in the world after Binance in terms of number of users. In terms of trading volume, Coinbase ranks fourth in the world with as much as \u20ac2 billion in daily trades.\n\nBinance\n\nIn its latest year-end letter, Binance\u2018s CEO revealed that by 2022 the platform had reached 120 million users (thus quadrupling its user base compared to 2021). With more than 19 billion in daily trades, today Binance represents the platform with the largest trading volume in the world.\n\nCrypto.com\n\nFrom February 2021 to December 2022, Crypto.com\u2019s user base grew 7-fold to 70 million individuals (20 million of which were gained between May 2022 and December 2022 alone). This platform, originally from Singapore, was only launched in 2019 and is already the 40th largest exchange in the world by trading volume (\u20ac370 million in daily trades).\n\nKuCoin\n\nFrom December 2021 to December 2022, the number of KuCoin users nearly tripled, growing from 10 million to 27 million. With 660 million euros of daily trading, KuCoin represents the 27th largest exchange in the world by trading volume to date. It was founded in 2017 by Michael Gan and Eric Don and today offers the ability to buy and sell over 700 cryptocurrencies in more than 200 countries around the world.\n\nBitget\n\nFrom March 2022 to January 2023, Bitget\u2019s user base quadrupled, growing from 2 million to 8 million. Bitget\u2019s growth is due in large part to the company\u2019s ability to forge strategic partnerships with major sports personalities, including Leo Messi.\n\nFounded in 2018, today Bitget represents the 29th largest exchange in the world by trading volume (more than 605 million in daily trades). It operates in 50 countries around the world and boasts a team of more than 600 professionals.\n\nUsers of major wallets\n\nMore than 100 million mobile wallets were downloaded between January and October 2022. This figure testifies to a drop in downloads of more than 40% compared to data from 2021, a period of full bull run when the number of wallets downloaded exceeded 177 million. However, it is important to mention that this record figure corresponds to the highest level of annual downloads ever recorded and that at the time of writing we are at a level three times higher than the pre-bull run period of 2020:\n\nOn the other hand, the following graph shows the downloads of one of the largest wallets, Blockchain.com, and shows us how these have increased over the past 12 months (although growth has slowed down quite a bit from October 2022 to the present):\n\nIn particular, the number of Blockchain.com wallet users has increased by 6% over the past year, exceeding 85 million (cumulative downloads from 2011 to the present).\n\nBusinesses that accept Bitcoin\n\nEven though during 2022 the price of Bitcoin reached its lowest value in 2 years, the adoption of cryptocurrency among merchants has grown. Evidence of this can be found in data from coinmap.org, which reports a 7% increase in the number of merchant establishments accepting Bitcoin between January 2022 and January 2023:\n\nThe table below orders in descending order the Italian cities with the largest number of businesses accepting Bitcoin as a payment method in 2023:\n\nCity Number of places that accept Bitcoin Milano 111 Roma 104 Trieste 53 Rovereto 50 Verona 37 Venezia 32 Bologna 30 Cagliari 23 Firenze 23 Genova 23 Trento 22 Torino 22 Padova 21 Palermo 20 Napoli 19 Reggio Emilia 19 Perugia 15 San Marino 15 Pisa 11 Pescara 8 Bari 7\n\nThe following, on the other hand, is a chart sorting Italian cities by the number of Bitcoin ATMs they have (updated as of September 2022):\n\nHash Rate\n\nThe Bitcoin hash rate also grew during 2022 and shows a clear upward trend:\n\nThe importance of considering hash rate as a broad adoption metric stems from the fact that its value is positively correlated with the difficulty of the network and the number and size of miners. Simply put, the arrival of new operators in the mining industry leads to an increase in difficulty and thus in hash rate. As we see in the graph above, Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate in 2023 is at a higher level than the bull run of 2020-2021, despite the fact that the price of the asset has collapsed.\n\nDaily transactions\n\nThe number of daily transactions, an indicative measure of Bitcoin usage, continues to hover between 200,000 and 300,000 since January 2022. However, if we look at a broader time horizon, we note how this metric has been going through a downtrend since January 2018:\n\nThis downtrend seems to have stopped in the last 12 months, a period in which the value of this metric has consolidated in the 200,000 to 300,000 range.\n\nGlobal Crypto Adoption Index\n\nOn 14 September 2022, Chainalysis shared a report on cryptocurrency adoption that ranks countries based on grassroots adoption. Grassroots adoption measures \u201cin which countries people invest most of their money in crypto.\u201d The result of research by Chainalysis shows that emerging countries have the highest level of adoption. In fact, of the 20 countries considered:\n\nTen fall into the lower middle-income category: Vietnam, Philippines, Ukraine, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Morocco, Nepal, Kenya, and Indonesia;\n\nEight are upper-middle income: Brazil, Thailand, Russia, China, Turkey, Argentina, Colombia and Ecuador;\n\nTwo belong to the high-income category: the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nItaly unfortunately still has a low level of adoption and is not included in the ranking of the 20 countries considered, which also excludes all other states belonging to the European Union.\n\nOpportunities for adoption in 2023\n\nDuring 2022, several countries around the world took major steps toward greater adoption of Bitcoin and decentralized technologies. Major events include El Salvador\u2019s new bill to launch Bitcoin Bonds, the adoption of Bitcoin as an official currency by the Central African Republic, the collaboration between Tether and Lugano under the Lugano Plan B initiative, and finally the birth of Bitcoin Island in the Philippines. Let\u2019s see them in detail below:\n\nLugano Plan B\n\nThe Plan B Forum, an event sponsored by Tether Operations Limited and the City of Lugano in order to facilitate the adoption of Bitcoin in Switzerland\u2019s most populated city, was held in Lugano on 28 October 2022. Thanks to the partnership with Tether, the City of Lugano can already boast thirty businesses that accept Bitcoin as a payment method.\n\nHowever, Lugano\u2019s Plan B has even more ambitious goals: to extend the use of Bitcoin to the payment of taxes and to transform Lugano into a crypto-friendly city. The mayor of Lugano stated in this regard that: \u201cthe Swiss law itself already facilitates the use of this tool, we want to extend the use as much as possible and make the city a place where blockchain-related professionalism and startups are born.\u201d\n\nThe initiative of the City of Lugano thus represents a great opportunity to promote the adoption of Bitcoin on the European continent, starting right from one of the world\u2019s leading financial centers.\n\nAfrica\n\nIn the Global Crypto Adoption Index ranking that we have seen in the previous paragraphs, three African states appear among the top twenty: Nigeria, Morocco and Kenya. In addition, On 27 April 2022, the Central African Republic followed in El Salvador\u2019s footsteps, establishing itself as the second country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as its official currency.\n\nOn the Fourth of July, it also launched its CBDC (Sango Coin). The high prevalence of Bitcoin in Africa is likely due to the high inflation rates that characterize the economies of most countries on the continent and the dependence on foreign remittances.\n\nTo make matters worse, Africa has the largest concentration of individuals without bank accounts.\n\nBitcoin Island (Philippines)\n\nBoracay is a small island in the Philippines with a population of less than 20,000. However, it is frequented each year by thousands of tourists attracted by its beaches. The company behind the wallet, Pouch, has implemented an extensive evangelization campaign on the island and converted more than 100 local businesses that now accept Bitcoin as a means of payment.\n\nThe reason Pouch chose to focus on the Philippines is due to the country\u2019s rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies. As we saw in the chapter devoted to the Global Crypto Adoption Index, the Philippines is in fact the second largest crypto adoption country in the world, second only to Vietnam.\n\nBitcoin City (El Salvador)\n\nOn 17 November 2022, the Minister of Economy of El Salvador presented a new bill confirming the government\u2019s plan to raise $1 billion for the construction of \u201cBitcoin City.\u201d This bill calls on lawmakers to create a clear legislative framework for the use of digital assets in public issues in the country of El Salvador.\n\n\u201cBitcoin bonds,\u201d the tools that will be used to raise financing, had been introduced by Bukele as early as 2021. During 2022, however, the project was continuously postponed. In fact, the launch was scheduled for March 2022, and it was then delayed to September and then to a date to be determined. According to Bukele\u2019s statement, the delay was caused by the fact that the government had to prioritize pension reform.\n\nIn any case, when the Vulcan Bonds are finally launched, they will represent the first example of bonds issued on blockchain. The hope is that this can finally become a reality in 2023, and inspire other states to adopt decentralized finance.\n\nConclusions\n\nAlthough Bitcoin\u2019s price plummeted during 2022, its fundamentals still appear solid. In particular, the number of users of major exchanges has increased at a very fast pace over the past 12 months, and some platforms have seen their user bases increase by 300% to 400%. The number of downloads of Bitcoin wallets in 2022 was 100 million, down 40% from 2021 but up 300% from 2020.\n\nIn contrast, the number of businesses accepting Bitcoin worldwide increased by 7% in 2022, and today we count more than 30,400 businesses. The hash rate shows a clear upward trend and the number of daily transactions has been moving within the 200 to 300 thousand range for a good 12 months.\n\nEmerging countries boast the highest crypto adoption today, and no EU country ranks in Chainalysis\u2019 Global Crypto Adoption Index."
