Kentucky regulators\u2019 recent decision to reject a cryptocurrency mining subsidy sends a powerful message that the needs of average energy consumers are more important than crypto profits.\n\nWashington, DC (August 31, 2023)\u2013 On Tuesday, Kentucky\u2019s state utility regulator rejected a controversial proposal by Kentucky Power to give millions in energy price discounts to Ebon International\u2019s proposed crypto mining facility in Louisa, Kentucky. In response to this decision, Joshua Archer, Greenpeace USA Bitcoin Campaign Lead, said: \u201cAcross the country, Bitcoin mining companies have tried to make families foot the bill for Bitcoin\u2019s enormous energy consumption. Kentucky regulators\u2019 recent decision to reject a cryptocurrency mining subsidy sends a powerful message that the needs of average energy consumers are more important than crypto profits. The proposed Bitcoin mine in Kentucky had the potential to burden ratepayers further at a time of growing energy prices and extend the Big Sandy gas plant\u2019s life cycle until the distant year of 2041. This decision is a significant step forward, but Ebon International\u2019s proposed mining facility remains a threat to our efforts to avert the worst consequences of climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining facilities cause enormous amounts of pollution and are a lifeline to the fossil fuel industry. Kentucky has taken a good first step to stop this one Bitcoin mine from exploiting and polluting a community. However, the real issue lies in Bitcoin\u2019s energy-intensive consensus mechanism and the tactics utilized by Bitcoin miners. Until Bitcoin moves to a less energy-intensive code, companies like Ebon International will move from one community to another searching for more opportunities to exploit communities and delaying progress on climate change.\u201d\n\n###\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Greenpeace USA Senior Communications Specialist, [email protected], (631) 404-9977\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.

        "title": "Bitcoin price slides after SEC pushes back ETF approvals - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe price of bitcoin sank 5 per cent after regulators deferred approvals of the first US exchange traded funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency, damping investors hopes for a speedy route to the world\u2019s largest capital market.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission said late on Thursday in a series of filings that it needed more time to consider seven bitcoin ETF applications, including one from BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager.\n\nThe fall in the price of bitcoin meant the token had unwound most of the gains it had made after a Washington court this week ruled the agency had been wrong to reject an application by asset manager Grayscale to turn its flagship vehicle, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, into an ETF.\n\nThe court ruling has put pressure on the SEC to relent from a decade-long policy of refusing ETFs based directly on the controversial token. Crypto advocates have long called for a spot bitcoin ETF, arguing it offers consumers a cheap and safe way to trade the coin, instead of buying it directly from unregulated crypto exchanges.\n\nDemand for a spot bitcoin ETF has grown this year and more traditional players have attempted to break into the sector. Fidelity, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, Bitwise and Valkyrie Digital Assets also had their applications for a spot bitcoin ETF delayed on Thursday.\n\nBut the regulator has argued that it cannot offer investors reassurance that the bitcoin market is not prone to being manipulated. Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, in July called the crypto market \u201crife with fraud, rife with hucksters\u201d. Even so, the SEC has approved bitcoin futures ETFs, which track the price of futures linked to the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Washington court has forced the SEC to review its approach to bitcoin ETFs. It has 45 days to decide whether to abide by the court decision, ask a court to review it or make a direct appeal. The SEC said it was \u201creviewing the court\u2019s decision to determine next steps\u201d. The regulator is expected to make its decisions on spot bitcoin ETFs in mid-October.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is quite feasible that the SEC will craft alternative arguments to justify continued rejections of spot bitcoin ETF applications based on concerns specific to the spot bitcoin market,\u201d said Mark Palmer, an analyst at Berenberg Capital Markets.\n\nHe pointed out that the involvement of Coinbase in the ETF filings further complicated the issue. Coinbase has proposed surveillance-sharing agreements with the regulated exchanges hosting the potential ETF listings, CBOE Global Markets and Nasdaq. Earlier this year the regulator sued Coinbase for allegedly violating US securities laws.\n\n\u201cWe would not be surprised if [Coinbase\u2019s] potential involvement in those ETFs were to serve as part of the SEC\u2019s reconfigured arguments for rejecting the applications,\u201d added Palmer.\n\nHowever, lawyers suggest a fresh round of rejections citing new concerns will be a challenge for the SEC, which has long justified its opposition to these products on market manipulation grounds.\n\n\u201cIn theory, they could try to oppose these applications on other grounds but for years they\u2019ve put all their eggs in the basket of there not being a sufficiently regulated market to trade cryptocurrencies, and the court resoundingly rejected the SEC\u2019s argument for that,\u201d said Jeremy Senderowicz of law firm Vedder Price."

        "title": "Is It Time to Sell Bitcoin? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -0.29%) has been volatile lately. After hovering near the $30,000 mark for several weeks, a handful of mildly bearish news items drove the largest crypto down to $26,000. Then, a helpful legal verdict briefly pushed Bitcoin past $28,000 again.\n\nThese unpredictable price swings beg the question -- is it time to buy Bitcoin at a reasonable price, or time to sell before the coin takes a swan dive?\n\nLet's take a look at both sides of the Bitcoin.\n\nReasons to sell Bitcoin today\n\nBitcoin bears have a few arguments in favor of cashing in their coins and moving on. For example:\n\nCryptocurrencies started 2023 in fine form, but the rally ran out of steam. The ups and downs of the last five months added up to nothing: Current Bitcoin prices also prevailed in the middle of May. Ergo, the bull run is over and the only way is down.\n\nMaster investors like Warren Buffett still don't see any value in digital currencies. Bitcoin is just a speculative gamble to the Oracle of Omaha, and he's a financial genius. He can't be wrong in the long run, right?\n\nThe long-awaited breakthroughs in regulations and legal codes are still conspicuously absent. You can't expect institutional investors and other heavyweights to put real money into Bitcoin until there's a robust governmental framework for owning and trading it. It's time to give up, since lawmakers and regulators keep dragging their feet.\n\nBitcoin is a bunch of numbers, automatically managed by computer programs. Where's the substance? This silly digital contraption shouldn't be worth thousands of dollars per token, because it doesn't really do anything.\n\nOh, and the immunity from inflation that many bulls hold up as a great reason to own this digital coin is just an illusion. The lifetime cap of 21 million Bitcoins is just a single value in the system management code, easily changed and forgotten.\n\nReasons to buy Bitcoin nowadays\n\nOn the other hand, bullish Bitcoin investors have plenty of arguments to fuel their digital fires:\n\nShort-term chart squiggles don't mean much in the long run, and past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Whether the Bitcoin market moves up or down from here, the stalled pricing in the middle of 2023 won't mean much to future Bitcoin investors. But the leading crypto shows market-beating returns over the last three or five years, and the gap only grows if you stretch the timeline further. The Bitcoin community is building a game-changing financial tool here, and it shows in the sustained creation of long-term value.\n\nBuffett is indeed an investing genius, but he would also be the first to tell you that he makes mistakes, too. In particular, he has been known to stay away from market-beating winners such as Amazon AMZN 0.96% ) Apple AAPL 1.32% )\n\nThe legal wheels may grind slowly, but they do keep on moving. The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) lawsuit against XRP 's XRP -0.15% ) has moved on to precedent-setting appeals and trials, with strong support for treating (at least some) cryptos more like currencies than securities. In another legal case, the SEC has been ordered to stop kicking the can and finally review the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust 's GBTC -2.09% )\n\n's has moved on to precedent-setting appeals and trials, with strong support for treating (at least some) cryptos more like currencies than securities. In another legal case, the SEC has been ordered to stop kicking the can and finally review the 's Bitcoin is an advanced system for managing transactions and the value each contract represents. It keeps a publicly available record of financial actions on the open internet, protected by a complex system of encryption and a safety-in-numbers approach to transaction security. In Bitcoin's proof-of-work blockchain network, you can't roll back or duplicate transactions unless you control more than half of the global network of Bitcoin's mining nodes. That's an impossibly expensive idea. And this public yet ultra-secure system offers lower fees and faster resolution of transactions than traditional banking services. The blockchain ledger is a real and useful business tool.\n\nOh, and the large-scale computing requirements that protect Bitcoin's transactions play a similar role in protecting the anti-inflation cap. In order to change that value, you'd have to convince the owners of more than half of the world's Bitcoin miner machinery to dilute the value of their own current and future Bitcoin holdings. It would also undermine public trust in the whole Bitcoin system -- and cryptocurrencies at large. I don't see that happening.\n\nRisks, meet rewards: Bitcoin is a solid long-term investment right now\n\nThere's a solid counterargument to every bearish complaint, but I'm not so sure about rebuttals for the bullish arguments. So I'm keeping a close eye on the legal developments and changes on the technical side of things, fully expecting the general price trend to continue upward in the long run. And we haven't even looked at upcoming value drivers such as the \"halvening\" of 2024 and rising interest in decentralized finance applications.\n\nThe conclusion is clear. This would be a terrible time to sell all your Bitcoin and walk away from the crypto market. If anything, Bitcoin's lull looks like a buying opportunity. Given the long-term value creation and advancements on the regulatory front, betting against Bitcoin now may be a decision you'll regret in 2024 and beyond."

        "title": "Bitcoin Beneficiaries: Spot Bitcoin ETF Could Propel These Funds - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Big news in the world of cryptocurrencies arrived Tuesday when D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Neomi Rao ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must abandon its rejection of Grayscale\u2019s application to convert the popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to the exchange traded fund structure.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether or not the ruling compels the SEC to finally approve spot bitcoin ETFs \u2013 arguably the most desired product in U.S. ETF industry history \u2013 but experts believe that\u2019s exactly what the ruling implies. After all, Rao wrote her in her opinion that it\u2019s \"arbitrary and capricious\" that the SEC continues stifling GBTC conversion efforts after approving futures-based bitcoin ETFs several years ago.\n\nIndeed, the ruling is \u201ckind of a big deal\u201d and the reasoning behind that statement is easy to understand. Score of ETF issuers have filed applications for spot bitcoin ETFs. Should that structure gain regulatory approval, those funds will create substantial demand for the largest cryptocurrency \u2013 pertinent because bitcoin supply is fixed at 21 million.\n\nTranslation: New demand for bitcoin could lead to more constrained supply, in turn sending prices higher. Should that scenario play out as expected, other established crypto-correlated ETFs stand to benefit. Here are a few to consider.\n\nInvesco Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO)\n\nThe Invesco Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) already proved its leverage to the possibility of a spot bitcoin ETF coming to market, surging nearly 13% on Tuesday following Judge Rao\u2019s ruling. SATO, which follows the Alerian Galaxy Global Cryptocurrency-Focused Blockchain Equity, Trusts and ETPs Index, allocates 15.70% of its weight, making a predictable, potent winner should the index fund convert to ETF status.\n\nAdditionally, the bulk of the rest of the SATO lineup are bitcoin miners equities \u2013 stocks that are intimately correlated to the cryptocurrency\u2019s price action. In other words, there\u2019s a lot to like with SATO should spot bitcoin ETFs be approved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s excellent that the judge in the Greyscale vs SEC case was able to see the obvious correlation between Bitcoin futures and spot price. Products like Grayscale\u2019s holdings have converted to ETFs in other commodity markets, and it makes no sense to treat crypto differently,\u201d said Greg Moritz, Chief Operating Officer at AltTab Capital, in a statement. \u201cRules for financial markets need to be based on data, not arbitrary and capricious sentiment toward a legitimate and growing asset class.\u201d\n\nBitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ)\n\nThe Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) is an index-based ETF that turned two years old in May. Its approach is comparable to that of SATO in that it\u2019s chock full of crypto-correlated stocks, including miners and exchange operators such as Coinbase (COIN).\n\nIndeed, BITQ\u2019s lineup is small with just 27 holdings, but it\u2019s potentially mighty when it comes to leverage to a spot bitcoin ETF coming to fruition \u2013something that could happen.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe the SEC will act as kingmaker and the most likely outcome is a block approval of applications that meet requirements, probably in Q1\u201924,\u201d noted Tim Bevan, CEO at ETC Group. \u201cThe level of pent up institutional and retail demand in the US is significant and we expect this to have a positive impact on the price of Bitcoin as can be seen from today\u2019s price reaction, as well as further accelerate the global trend towards acknowledging crypto as a new asset class.\u201d\n\nGlobal X Blockchain ETF (BKCH)\n\nThe Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) follows the Solactive Blockchain Index and as its name implies, its point of emphasis is blockchain technology. The good news there is blockchain has expansive applications beyond crypto, but BKCH still has credibility as a spot bitcoin ETF beneficiary.\n\nThat much is confirmed by the fact that the Global X ETF is up 7.45% over the past week, indicating it benefit from the appellate court ruling.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark legal win for crypto against the US regulator,\u201d said deVere Group CEO Nigel Green in a new report. \u201cThe court\u2019s decision destroys the SEC\u2019s central argument for rejecting every spot Bitcoin ETF over the last few years. This win paves the way for bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

In fact, some crypto mining stocks have been among the best-performing investments in the entire market this year.\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency miners remain extremely volatile and risky investments, but speculators are hoping these seven top crypto mining stocks can maintain their bullish momentum:\n\nStock Year-to-date performance as of Aug. 31 Riot Platforms Inc.

(BITF) 209%\n\nRiot Platforms Inc. (RIOT)\n\nRiot Platforms is a U.S. Bitcoin mining company focused on growing its hash rate and infrastructure capacity. The company's mining operations are located in central Texas, and the company's Rockdale facility's 700 megawatts (MW) in developed capacity make it the single largest Bitcoin mining and hosting facility in North America. In August, Riot reported a record $76.7 million in quarterly revenue and a record hash rate capacity of 10.7 exahashes per second (EH/s). Riot mined 1,775 BTC in the second quarter and has lowered its average production cost to just $8,389 per Bitcoin. RIOT shares have jumped by 234.8% in 2023, and they closed at $11.35 on Aug. 31.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings Inc. (MARA)\n\nMarathon Digital is a U.S. Bitcoin mining company that operates its own mining pool, invests in mining hardware, builds custom firmware and designs mining infrastructure. The company aims to improve mining efficiency by integrating its own technology to streamline operations. In the second quarter, Marathon reported $81.8 million in revenue and a 314% year-over-year increase in Bitcoin production. Marathon sold 63% of the Bitcoin it produced during the quarter to fund operating costs. Marathon also reported an \"energized\" hash rate of 17.7 EH/s, and the company holds about 12,538 BTC on its balance sheet. MARA stock is up 267.5% this year, closing at $12.57 on Aug. 31.\n\nCipher Mining Inc. (CIFR)\n\nCipher Mining is a technology company focused on developing and operating Bitcoin mining data centers in the U.S. In August, Cipher reported a record self-mining hash rate capacity of 6.8 EH/s in the second quarter and said the company is on track to bump that number to 7.2 EH/s in the third quarter. The company also plans to complete the buildout of its Odessa facility in Texas in the near future and is exploring a list of potential additional expansion opportunities. Cipher touts its \"best-in-class unit economics\" and has 10,536 BTC on its balance sheet. CIFR is the best-performing stock on this list so far in 2023, gaining a whopping 469.6%. CIFR shares were trading at $3.19 as of Aug. 31.\n\nHut 8 Mining Corp. (HUT)\n\nHut 8 Mining is a Canadian digital asset mining company that operates two mining facilities in southern Alberta. The company has 36,000 square feet of geo-diverse data center and cloud computing capacity and uses emission-free energy sources to run its operations. In August, the company opened up a shareholder vote on its plan to merge with U.S. Bitcoin Corp. to create New Hut, a company that will have 7.5 EH/s of installed self-mining capacity, 825 MW of total power under management and 253 MW of total energy at six different mining sites. HUT shares are up 185.9% so far this year, closing at $2.43 on Aug. 31.\n\n\n\nTeraWulf Inc. (WULF)\n\nTeraWulf is a U.S. Bitcoin miner focused on clean crypto mining. The company says its current Bitcoin production is powered by more than 91% zero-carbon energy, and its goal is to bump that number to 100% in the near future. In the second quarter, TeraWulf reported its hash rate capacity grew 67% over the prior quarter to 5.5 EH/s. The company mined 908 Bitcoin in the quarter, an impressive 70% quarter-over-quarter increase. Revenue per Bitcoin produced increased 21% in the quarter, while power cost per Bitcoin dropped 15%. TeraWulf is also expanding its Lake Mariner facility in New York by adding 18,500 mining machines. WULF stock has gained 211.9% in 2023, closing at $2.09 on Aug. 31.\n\nCanaan Inc. (CAN)\n\nCanaan is a somewhat unconventional cryptocurrency mining stock. The company produces high-performance application-specific integrated circuits cryptocurrency miners use to mine crypto. Canaan also researches and develops other technologies tied to supercomputing. Canaan is essentially akin to the retailers who sell picks and shovels to gold miners during gold rushes.

But another extension could be possible, experts say.\n\nThe update came two days after a federal appeals court sided with Grayscale in a lawsuit against the SEC for denying its application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an ETF.\n\n\"It is clear that bitcoin is something that retail investors want access to,\" former SEC chair Jay Clayton said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday, noting that \"an approval is inevitable.\"\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nStudent loan interest resumes \u2014 what that means for borrowers\n\n63% of workers unable to pay a $500 emergency expense, survey finds\n\nThe job market is 'normalizing,' economist says \u2014 what that means for workers\n\nThe Grayscale ruling isn't necessarily a green light for a spot bitcoin ETF, said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar. But pending applications from Blackrock , Fidelity and others \"have increased the probability overall.\"\n\nU.S. investors currently have access to bitcoin futures ETFs, which invest in bitcoin futures contracts, or agreements to buy or sell the asset later for an agreed-upon price. The long-awaited bitcoin spot ETF, however, would invest in the digital currency directly."

This development exposes the differing attitudes of regulators in Europe versus the US toward cryptocurrencies. A spot bitcoin ETF lets investors invest in bitcoin without buying or holding the cryptocurrency directly.\n\nAnnounced last year, the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF (ticker: BCOIN) might entice institutional investors with its green credentials. The digital asset fund is compliant with the European Union\u2019s sustainability guidelines. The ETF is the \u201cfirst digital asset fund compliant with SFDR [Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation] Article 8 through its decarbonization strategy,\u201d the firm said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe fund uses external data to measure the bitcoin ETF\u2019s energy usage and buys and subsequently retires verifiable built-in real energy certificates, an accepted convention for carbon offsetting. With negative sentiment surrounding the adverse environmental impact of bitcoin mining, Jacobi\u2019s apparent \u201cgreenness\u201d will be music to the ears of investors seeking ESG-compliant digital assets.\n\nThe new ETF\u2019s impact will be as political as well as economic. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has refused to approve spot bitcoin ETF applications, citing concerns over potential market manipulation.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s skeptical approach to cryptocurrencies has divided opinions, and some business leaders say the regulator\u2019s heavy-handed attitude risks marginalizing innovation and driving business abroad. Under SEC guidelines, the regulator can delay ETF applications for up to 240 days, suggesting it may not rule on some spot ETF requests until next year.\n\nWith the Euronext launch, BlackRock and others may contend that Europe has moved ahead of the US, which will increase pressure on the SEC and stoke the frustration of some legislators.\n\n\u201cApproval by Europe will likely exert pressure on the SEC to rethink its decisions on BlackRock\u2019s application for a bitcoin spot ETF, which has significantly influenced the entire narrative around both bitcoin and cryptocurrencies,\u201d says Vijay Valecha, chief investment officer at Dubai-based Century Financial. Recent changes by the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority have also fueled hopes of a pathway to an ETF, but many analysts remain doubtful."

The lawsuit \u2013 filed in April 2022 by a group of investors against Uniswap and its creator Hayden Adams \u2013 alleged the DeFi platform violated U.S. securities laws by failing to register as an exchange or broker-dealer, offering and soliciting securities on an unregistered exchange. The suit sought to hold Uniswap accountable for investors losing money to \u201cscam tokens\u201d issued and traded on the protocol. The tokens cited in the suit include Ethereum (ERC-20) tokens EthereumMax (EMAX), Bezoge (BEZOGE) and Alphawolf Finance (AWF). But Wednesday's ruling to scrap the suit before it goes to trial stated the true defendants of the case were the issuers of the tokens in question, not Uniswap. While SEC Chief Gary Gensler has so far shied away from calling ETH a security, Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York directly called it a commodity and declined to \"stretch the federal securities laws to cover the conduct alleged,\" in the case against Uniswap."

During the show, Broyles laid out his Bitcoin investment thesis and his unique perspectives on how the asset\u2019s price could eventually rise into seven-figure territory.\n\nBroyles said that in 2020, he realized the bond market was broken. While searching for alternative investments, he discovered Bitcoin as a sound option. When asked about his Bitcoin investment strategy and how he stomachs the volatility, Broyles said:\n\n\u201cI do not own bonds. I have sold off 97% of my stocks over the past three years, and I\u2019m selling off the last 3% this week actually, so it\u2019s funny that you ask that. By the end of this week, the only three assets that I will own will be U.S. dollars, aka cash, the best political currency in the world; second, real estate; and third, Bitcoin. That\u2019s it. And I sleep better now than I did with a diversified portfolio.\u201d\n\nEverything is overpriced and should crash\n\nAnother key factor backing Broyles\u2019 Bitcoin investment thesis is his belief that \u201ceverything is overvalued, nothing makes sense, and everything should crash; however, we don\u2019t want to deal with it. Politicians don\u2019t want to deal with it. Lawyers don\u2019t want to deal with it. I, as a real estate investor, don\u2019t want to deal with it.\u201d Broyles believes that stocks, healthcare, real estate and the education industry are highly overvalued, so people are losing faith in the dollar and their dollar purchasing power \u2014 which highlights the allure of Bitcoin as a supply-capped asset.\n\n\u201cIf we have a credit unwind, of course we\u2019re going to print ourselves out of it.\u201d\n\nRelated: The future of BTC mining and the Bitcoin halving\n\nWhen is it too late to invest in Bitcoin?\n\nWhen asked whether there is a particular price where it becomes \u201ctoo late\u201d for investors to consider buying Bitcoin, Broyles made the analogy of a sinking ship and suggested that for those on the boat, it\u2019s never too late to exit.\n\n\u201cAt no point is it ever too late to buy Bitcoin, but it will be too late to exit bonds and to exit fiat.\u201d\n\nListen to the full episode of Market Talks on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel, and don\u2019t forget to click \u201cLike\u201d and \u201cSubscribe\u201d to keep up-to-date with all our latest content."

        "content": "Bitcoin, Ether and most top ten non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies dropped Friday morning in Asia. At a touch above US$26,000, Bitcoin has traced back most of the gains triggered by Tuesday\u2019s favorable U.S. court ruling for Grayscale Investments in its Bitcoin ETF case against the SEC. Equity futures in the U.S. were little changed following a mixed session Thursday. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index moved higher as consumers continue to spend. Investors expect today\u2019s U.S. payroll report for August to shed more light on coming interest rate policy.\n\nCryptos down as SEC delays more ETF decisions\n\nBitcoin dropped 4.42% over the last 24 hours to US$26,042.84 as of 07:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The token is down 0.26% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value fell along with other cryptocurrencies after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced Thursday it will delay seven spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund applications until October. Some of the world\u2019s largest asset managers including BlackRock, WisdomTree, and VanEck are among those waiting on the SEC for ETF approval.\n\n\u201cThe move is very clear; the pump we had from Grayscale-SEC news is now faded,\u201d Benjamin Stani, director of business development at Hong Kong-based digital asset broker Matrixport, said in a text message.\n\nThe market, Stani added, \u201cwas hoping that after Grayscale, there [would be] a path forward and had some analysts up the probability of a spot ETF approval before the year-end \u2014 but it looks like not so soon.\u201d\n\nEther dipped 3.15% to US$1,648.76 over the past 24 hours for a weekly loss of 0.33%.\n\n\u201cThe current technical signals for Ethereum appear to be undergoing a period of mixed trends across different time frames,\u201d Rachael Lucas, crypto technical analyst at BTC Markets, told Forkast via text message.\n\nEther market data shows the token is on track to form a so-called \u201cdeath cross\u201d \u2014 \u201ca development often viewed with caution by market participants,\u201d Lucas said. The cross, which occurs when the short-term average falls below the long-term trend, is generally a sign of further losses ahead. Currently, the short-term 50-day average stands at 1808.3, while the 200-day average is at 1802.9, according to TradingView.\n\nLucas said that Ether has stepped into a negative territory in a weekly timeframe, which may lead to a short-term pullback. \u201cIt\u2019s essential to consider these movements in the context of broader market dynamics, as the cryptocurrency space can be characterized by rapid price shifts,\u201d Lucas explained.\n\nMost other top ten non-stablecoin cryptos posted losses, with Solana\u2019s SOL leading the losers. It dipped 5.07% to US$19.81, its lowest level in over six weeks. On Monday, Clockwork \u2014 a Solana-based automation network for smart contracts \u2014 shut down. Its founder Nick Garfield said he saw \u201climited commercial upside\u201d in the project.\n\nUltimately the reason we are stepping away now is simple opportunity cost.\n\n\n\nWe admittedly see limited commercial upside in continuing to develop the protocol, and have a growing personal interest to explore new opportunities.\n\n\n\n5/ \u2014 Nick (@time_composer) August 27, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, a U.S. court has dismissed a class action lawsuit filed against a group of five companies including decentralized trading platform Uniswap Labs. Plaintiffs claimed they were victims of a rugpull involving scam tokens on the Uniswap cryptocurrency exchange and are entitled to compensation.\n\nThe court ruled that the defendants are not responsible for those losses. Presiding Judge Katherine Polk Failla said \u201cdue to the Protocol\u2019s decentralized nature, the identities of the scam token issuers are basically unknown and unknowable.\u201d\n\nCrypto commentators interpret the ruling as a victory for decentralized finance with wide reaching implications for the industry.\n\n\u201cI believe that what happened in the case against Uniswap Labs could be the first steps in clarifying the legal and regulatory environment for DeFi applications and could make investors\u2019 concerns about sudden lawsuits and actions by regulators less and make them more predictable,\u201d wrote Samer Hasn, market analyst for online brokerage XS.com.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, this measure, and other similar possible measures, if taken in the future, may restrict investors\u2019 confidence in these applications due to the inability to regulate them and enforce the law on them,\u201d Hasn added.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 3.46% to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume gained 16.61% to US$37.31 billion.\n\nU.S. futures trade flat ahead of jobs data\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures were little changed as of 10:15 a.m. in Hong Kong after a mixed regular session for the three major indexes during Thursday\u2019s regular trading hours.\n\nThursday\u2019s release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index for July showed that U.S. consumer spending grew by the biggest margin in six months. However, other economic indicators point to a slowing of the economy, with experts predicting a halt to interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve in September.\n\n\u201cThe PCE is being keenly watched as investors were cheered earlier in the week by the weaker-than-expected payrolls data and annual gross domestic product growth forecast \u2013 both of which strongly make the case that the Federal Reserve must now stop its most aggressive tightening campaign in decades,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an email statement.\n\nThe Fed raised its interest rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% in July, the highest level in 22 years. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts an 88.0% chance that the central bank will maintain the current rate at the next meeting in September, up from 81.0% a week ago.\n\nInvestors now look to Friday\u2019s release of the U.S. jobs report for August released later on Friday, adding to last month\u2019s labor market slowdown.\n\n\u201cJob openings are falling, and American workers are more reluctant to leave their positions right now,\u201d Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CNN. He added that the market is seeing a reset after a post-coronavirus hiring frenzy.\n\nMeanwhile, the main Asia equity indexes were mixed. China\u2019s SSE Composite, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and South Korea\u2019s Kospi moved up while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index fell.\n\nOn Thursday, China lowered the minimum down payment for homebuyers in its largest cities in an effort to boost the country\u2019s slowing housing market. The nationwide minimum downpayment will be set at 20% for first-time buyers and 30% for second-timers, effective Sep. 25.\n\nChina is facing a crisis in its real estate sector following the downfall of the Evergrande Group. The nation\u2019s non-manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index released Thursday hit a yearly low. The news has led to more caution in global equities as traders assess a slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n\n\u201cThe conventional wisdom seems to be flipping from a concern with the unstoppable rise of Chinese power to a worry about the irrevocable decline of China\u2019s economy and population,\u201d Richard Fontaine, CEO of Washington-based Center for a New American Security, told Bloomberg.\n\n(Updates to add quotes from Rachael Lucas)"

        "content": "Some critics point to Canada and Europe's lukewarm response to bitcoin ETFs. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine that things would pan out differently with a fully regulated spot market bitcoin ETF in the United States. It\u2019s no secret that the SEC is cracking down heavily on cryptocurrencies, but any keen observer would\u2019ve noticed a common thread by now. Regulators have focused their ire on altcoins for the most part. While stablecoins have also faced scrutiny, bitcoin remains the most likely digital asset to be approved as is for integration into regulated systems."

        "title": "SEC delays verdict on BlackRock's ETF application; Will Bitcoin ETFs see light of day? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday postponed its decisions on seven Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals, including one submitted by BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager.\n\nSeven firms \u2014 BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Wise Origin, VanEck, Bitwise and Valkyrie Digital Assets \u2014 published ETF applications in the Federal Register on July 19. The SEC was scheduled to rule on all seven applications by Sept. 4. However, the regulator postponed by 45 days meaning the seven firms will now have to wait until mid-October for a decision.\n\n\u201cWe fully expected delays on this round of spot Bitcoin ETF filings. Would have been a shock if they were approved this week,\u201d James Seyffart, research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, tweeted on Friday.\n\nTo the frustration of those in the crypto industry, the SEC can delay its verdict on ETF proposals for a maximum of 240 days, or about six months. The federal agency had already delayed its deadline on the proposal from Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management on Aug 11.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s latest decision comes days after the District of Columbia Court of Appeals sided with Grayscale Investments, the manager of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The court overturned an earlier SEC decision preventing GBTC\u2019s conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Neomi Rao called the SEC\u2019s denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201ccapricious\u201d in the review of the petition because the agency failed to clearly explain what distinguishes spot Bitcoin ETFs from already-listed futures ETFs.\n\nGrayscale argued in an October 2022 legal update posted on its website that the SEC did not provide clear explanations for the rejection, violating the Administrative Procedure Act. The company also stated that the SEC decision was inconsistent with its approvals of Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nDespite the SEC postponing the latest series of applications, Nigel Green, founder of financial management group deVere, said in a statement that Grayscale\u2019s victory now makes spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. an \u201cinevitability.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s decision destroys the SEC\u2019s central argument for rejecting every spot Bitcoin ETF over the last few years. This win paves the way for Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d Green said.\n\nGeorgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business professor James Angel said before the court\u2019s decision that the SEC may even want to lose the Grayscale case, forcing them to allow all the ETF applications currently pending.\n\n\u201cThis would take the blame away from the SEC if and when Bitcoin has another crash or another crypto ice age,\u201d Angel said.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price rollercoaster pause\n\nThe news of Grayscale\u2019s win triggered a surge in crypto prices. Bitcoin grew 7% shortly after the news to above US$28,000 on Tuesday. But the SEC\u2019s subsequent delay in the seven other cases Thursday poured cold water on the sector, triggering a downturn to below US$26,000. Bitcoin fell 4.62% in the past 24 hours to US$25,988 at 3:45 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong.\n\nThe sharp price swings reflect the industry\u2019s interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Ric Edelman, founder of the U.S.-based think tank Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, said that a green light from the SEC, if given, would cause an even greater upswing in crypto prices.\n\n\u201cAround half of the nation\u2019s financial advisors in the United States personally own Bitcoin, but only 12% are recommending Bitcoin to their clients,\u201d said Edelman. \u201cAnd the primary reason that advisors are not recommending Bitcoin is because there isn\u2019t an ETF.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose advisors manage about US$8 trillion in investor assets,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, Georgetown\u2019s James Angel said that a spot Bitcoin ETF win will not be a long-term growth factor for the crypto market.\n\n\u201cInvestors already have an almost identical product with the futures-backed ETF, so I don\u2019t see a big long-term impact,\u201d said Angel. \u201cThere will clearly be an emotional short-term rally when the approval comes out, but that will get lost in the noise in the long-term.\u201d\n\nSean Stein Smith, professor of economics at the City University of New York and founder of the Institute for Blockchain & Cryptoasset Research, said that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs will have a positive impact on the wider crypto industry.\n\n\u201c[Spot Bitcoin ETFs] will open the proverbial door for more product approvals and launches, including those that are related to Bitcoin as well as other crypto assets,\u201d Smith added.\n\nSo when will investors have access to spot Bitcoin ETFs from investment giants like BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco?\n\nTaking account of different possibilities and factors, it is more likely we\u2019ll see a batch of ETFs approved in the early half of next year, said Julian Klymochko, founder and CEO of Calgary-based investment solutions firm Accelerate.\n\n\u201cI think a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is a 2024 story. When in 2024 they\u2019ll launch, it\u2019s to be seen, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it in the first or second quarter,\u201d said Klymochko. \u201cI think that things are going to be moving quickly. There are many, many companies that have applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF, so it\u2019s certainly going to be a battle.\u201d\n\nCrypto wild west: SEC sheriff\u2019s rules\n\nThe series of spot Bitcoin ETF applications from major U.S. firms was submitted in the midst of an ongoing crypto crackdown. Increased scrutiny over the industry by the SEC is based on the regulator\u2019s claim that most cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are securities. The federal agency sued Coinbase and Binance.US in July on the basis that the two exchanges offer unregistered securities in the form of cryptocurrencies.\n\nMore recently, the SEC made its first enforcement action against non-fungible tokens (NFTs), charging media company Impact Theory with offering unregistered securities in the form of NFTs on Monday.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has emerged as the crypto industry\u2019s main bogeyman, said at a Senate Appropriations Financial Services subcommittee hearing in Washington D.C. in July that the \u201cWild West\u201d of crypto is \u201crife with noncompliance.\u201d\n\nGustavo Schwenkler, professor of finance at Santa Clara University, said that Gensler and the SEC have reason to be concerned.\n\n\u201cThe existing ETFs track derivatives that are traded on strictly regulated derivatives exchanges. There are not that many derivatives exchanges that are closely monitored by the regulator,\u201d said Schwenkler. \u201cA spot Bitcoin ETF would track the Bitcoin price that is available across global crypto exchanges. There are a lot of them and many are not well regulated.\u201d\n\nHowever, Megan Enright, spokesperson for Swiss digital asset manager 21Shares, said that \u201cmaterial changes\u201d in the market over the past year or so mean that it is now better prepared for ETFs than it was in the past.\n\n\u201cThe market has matured, there is additional data supporting the efficiency of these markets and there are new surveillance sharing agreements that are being established between major crypto markets and traditional exchanges,\u201d Enright added.\n\nIn April, 21Shares refiled its application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. with its partner, Ark Invest."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin is Not a Bubble - YouHodler.com",
        "content": "Bitcoin is no stranger to volatility and doubt, but does that signify the cryptocurrency is in a bubble? There\u2019s a lot of evidence that points to the contrary. It\u2019s understandable that investors may have concerns and debates about a potential Bitcoin bubble. If it bursts, the crypto\u2019s value becomes insignificant. Traders may lose their investments entirely.\n\nBefore you decide to begin (or continue) using Bitcoin, you should make sure you understand what\u2019s in its future. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the substantial evidence that differs Bitcoin from other bubbles. The information discussed below provides traders with a well-reasoned and balanced argument against the Bitcoin bubble.\n\nWhy Bitcoin is not a Bubble: Historical Resilience\n\nBitcoin was first introduced in 2009. The Cryptocurrency experienced market volatility throughout its history. However, Bitcoin has always bounced back from any significant price drops. This includes long periods of bear market behavior, with some price declines lasting over nine months. Bitcoin has even gone through severe price crashes, including its latest crash in November 2022. However, its price has always evened out afterward and even climbed to new heights once again.\n\nWhen it launched, it had a value of $0, which climbed to $1 by April 2011. Just three months after that, the crypto\u2019s price shot up by 2,960% to $29.60. By November of the same year, its price declined to a mere $2.05. In 2013, Bitcoin experienced some strong gains, trading at $123 by October.\n\n\n\nThis is just a snapshot of the many price fluctuations and recoveries Bitcoin has experienced. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at around $25,000. Bitcoin\u2019s resilience in overcoming a wide range of challenging market conditions is clear. It survived the 2020 pandemic and the 2022 crash of FTX, a major crypto exchange. BTC continued to gain in value even after major downturns; it doesn\u2019t have the fragility of a crypto bubble.\n\nIncreasing Adoption and Recognition\n\nBitcoin has come a long way since its launch. It went from an obscure digital currency to mainstream crypto. Globally, 219 million people use Bitcoin as a payment method. Even more encouraging, Bitcoin is seen and treated as a legitimate asset by institutional investors, corporations, and governments. In the US, BTC and other cryptocurrencies are taxed - just like any other income.\n\nMajor companies like Shopify, Ralph Lauren, Microsoft, and even Starbucks use Bitcoin in their financial strategies. These organisations are crucial in gaining wider recognition of Bitcoin\u2019s usefulness. Bitcoin is the most popular crypto, with the total number of crypto users currently at 420 million. With the crypto market, in general, growing at around 4%, we can only expect more people to join its user base.\n\nDecentralization and Scarcity\n\nBitcoin\u2019s key attributes, including its decentralized nature and fixed supply, make it an especially attractive asset. Only 21 million coins can exist, and miners have already set 19 million of that supply in circulation. Bitcoin\u2019s expensive mining fees, which currently back its inherent value, will disappear once it reaches its cap.\n\nThe market price will then reflect the market\u2019s new supply and demand. Demand will increase for Bitcoin, as it remains the most popular crypto and gains more users. Its supply, however, will remain at a maximum of 21 million. Bitcoin\u2019s mining system is also different from other cryptos. The number of new Bitcoins minted per block mined is halved around every four years. The next halving will occur in 2024.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that users have already lost around 4 million Bitcoins due to losing their private keys. This makes the supply that more scarce. Bitcoin\u2019s core features lay a strong foundation for inherent value and scarcity in the face of significant demand. These features differentiate it from other popular cryptocurrencies. They\u2019re also not seen in traditional speculative bubbles.\n\nSupportive Technological Advancements\n\nLightning Network Capacity Chart via BitcoinVisuals\n\nSome investors have concerns about Bitcoin\u2019s scalability. At the time of its launch, its creators were more focused on Bitcoin\u2019s usability as a peer-to-peer payment system. It has no intermediaries, allowing for incredibly secure and easy transactions. As it grew, Bitcoin became users became more aware of the crypto trilemma. It\u2019s difficult to develop a system that balances scalability, decentralization, and security.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is facing the challenge head-on with solutions like the Lightning Network. As Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain grows in nodes, it carries more transaction data. To validate transactions, every node has to execute a computational task. The more nodes, the harder this becomes. The Lighting Network is a second layer of the blockchain.\n\nThe network forges channels between two parties, allowing them to send unlimited transactions. This occurs independently, instead of on the main blockchain. Payment channels are then linked together, lightening the load on the main blockchain\u2019s nodes. Other supportive technological solutions for scalability are also being explored.\n\nSharding is one of them. This process involves splitting the data into smaller sets, or shards. The blockchain can process these more manageable datasets parallel to each other. With many shards processed simultaneously, the validation process is made faster without compromising Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization.\n\nInstitutional Backing and Regulation\n\nMajor financial institutions, from JP Morgan to Goldman Sachs, are adopting Bitcoin into their strategies. Interest has spread even to venture capital firms, who want to explore tokenization. This is when real-world assets, like gold or precious gems, are minted on the blockchain. These digital tokens represent ownership of assets, which third parties can look after in secure locations. While still cautious, they want to increase involvement and investments in Bitcoin. Even the US government owns Bitcoin - 241,000 of them!\n\nBitcoin is also well-regulated, especially in the US. On a state level, it\u2019s regulated by local parties. On a federal level, it\u2019s regulated by the SEC, FinCEN, and the CTFC. Bitcoin and other digital assets fall under their jurisdiction, though global regulations are also pertinent. Countries like Switzerland and the UK implement the FATF Travel Rule. This prevents money laundering and other criminal activities around the globe by sharing data on institutions engaging in virtual assets.\n\nGlobal Economic Uncertainty\n\nAmidst global economic challenges, including high inflation rates and subpar growth, Bitcoin acts as a hedge against financial stress. While the cryptocurrency has experienced its fair share of volatility, hedging is a long game. Bitcoin\u2019s overall historical data points to its value increasing with time.\n\nBTC/USDT chart by TradingView\n\nMany use Bitcoin as a store of value - opening a new digital world of opportunity. Most stores of value are physical assets, like gold, bonds, or land. The Bitcoin in your secure digital wallet is available from any place with an Internet connection, at any time. With its influence only growing, Bitcoin makes for a great potential hedge against economic uncertainty. If it were a bubble, investors would avoid using it to store their money or to back their other assets.\n\n\n\nSuggested reading: What is a Store of Value? The Ultimate Guide\n\n\u200dConclusion: Why Bitcoin is not a bubble\n\nBitcoin has many attributes that solidify its value, usefulness, and potential for future growth. The information provided in this article showcases how different Bitcoin is from traditional bubbles. Its decentralized nature, secure transactions, and scalability are backed by its millions of users. Bitcoin\u2019s ability to overcome major financial events and challenges proves its tenacity in the market. The digital asset is also growing as a global mainstream payment method, supported by entire governments and major institutions.\n\nTraders can easily stack this evidence, creating a strong argument against the Bitcoin bubble. It\u2019s important to still consider Bitcoin\u2019s inherent risks, such as its market volatility. Before coming to a definite conclusion, conduct your own research and consider others\u2019 perspectives on the topic."

        "title": "Grayscale faces ETF war after winning bitcoin battle - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week, we\u2019re taking a look at Grayscale\u2019s victory in the US courts.\n\nMany previous editions of this newsletter have covered regulators punching at every corner of the crypto industry, from the largest crypto exchange to obscure lines of code.\n\nThis week, the tables turned.\n\nAsset management firm Grayscale, which holds roughly $17bn in bitcoin, won a landmark case against the Securities and Exchange Commission when a Washington DC court ruled that the regulator was wrong to reject the company\u2019s application to convert its flagship product into a bitcoin-backed exchange traded fund.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF has become something of a crypto holy grail \u2014 a way to trade bitcoin that is cheap, safe and wrapped in a well-understood regulatory wrapper. To say the crypto market was delighted is an understatement.\n\n\u201cAn SEC-regulated bitcoin ETF would unlock the next generation of crypto adoption, allowing trillions in institutional capital to come off the sidelines,\u201d said Diogo M\u00f3nica, co-founder and president of Anchorage Digital.\n\nBitcoin leapt roughly 7 per cent after the ruling. I\u2019d say such excitement over the prospect of a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund potentially happening at some point in the future, is a reflection of the failings of that global financial revolution bitcoin\u2019s founder promised 14 years ago.\n\nStill, the victory is a rare oasis of optimism for a space so often set back by scandals. Potentially great for the industry, but at what cost to Grayscale?\n\nEven before the hard-charging Gary Gensler became chair of the SEC, the agency had a consistent record of punting applications to launch a bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nSome have had specific reasons but the SEC has long argued the asset that underlies it all \u2014 bitcoin \u2014 trades on largely unregulated exchanges that may be susceptible to market manipulation.\n\nGrayscale won because it focused on the SEC\u2019s weak spot \u2014 that the regulator had given the green light to bitcoin ETFs that track futures on the token, traded on the CME.\n\nFutures and their underlying assets are closely linked. While the CME can attest to the orderliness of its own market and the way prices are formed and fed into it, the underlying market can still be manipulated. Market makers arbitraging prices just help close the gap.\n\nThe judge, Neomi Rao, agreed that this stance was odd and called the denial of Grayscale\u2019s application \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d. The ruling didn\u2019t permit a spot bitcoin ETF, and only told the SEC to go away and rethink its justifications for its denial.\n\nBut while Grayscale has been fighting it out in court, others have been banging on the SEC\u2019s door this summer with their own bitcoin ETF applications. They include BlackRock \u2014 the largest money manager in the world \u2014 and other household names such as WisdomTree and Fidelity.\n\nShould the ruling finally open the door to spot bitcoin ETFs, Grayscale is likely to be up against a host of household ETF names in the battle for customers. None of them come associated with the crypto crash of 2022.\n\n\u201cRetail investors and institutions alike may be attached to bigger names. If so, Grayscale made the legal investments to win this case, but having knocked the door down their competitors may walk right through it, marching on Grayscale\u2019s back in the process,\u201d Peter Fox, partner at Scoolidge, Peters, Russotti & Fox, told me over the phone.\n\nMore importantly, these rivals are all very accustomed to serious price competition. Grayscale earns a 2 per cent management fee on the bitcoin it holds \u2014 at present worth about $17bn. BlackRock, Invesco, etc are used to charging fractions of that total.\n\nOthers, such as Jeremy Senderowicz of law firm Vedder Price, are more optimistic. \u201cGrayscale has a pretty established name for bitcoin products and they\u2019re staring off with an asset base in their fund that nobody else has,\u201d he told me, referring to the fact that Grayscale is one of the largest holders of bitcoin on the planet.\n\nBut it\u2019s not hard to imagine the likes of BlackRock quickly scooping up their own stash of coins, either. It\u2019s also important to remember the court\u2019s decision does not by any stretch compel the SEC to approve Grayscale\u2019s application: however unlikely, the regulator could revert with an entirely new rationale to reject the company\u2019s ETF ambitions all over again.\n\nOvernight the SEC again deferred all the main spot bitcoin ETF applications filed this summer.\n\nStill, the expectation is growing that spot bitcoin ETFs will make landfall in the US at some point.\n\nIf and when the day comes, the SEC will probably approve several ETFs at once, rather than granting one player a potentially unassailable first-mover advantage.\n\n\u201cThat means this becomes a market share game. So on percentage share and take-rate, Grayscale revenues should decline significantly,\u201d Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of investment adviser Lumida Wealth Management, told me.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on Grayscale\u2019s court victory over the SEC? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nDespite a setback in ETF land, the SEC\u2019s push against all crypto-related activity continues unabated. On Monday it charged media and entertainment company Impact Theory LLC with conducting an unregistered offering of crypto asset securities in the form of non-fungible tokens. The company agreed to a cease-and-desist order without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings.\n\nOn Thursday industry giant Binance said it would \u201cgradually\u201d cease support for BUSD products, advising users to convert into other stablecoins before February 2024. The news doesn\u2019t come as a surprise after New York regulators halted further issuance of the coin in February this year, but it serves as a reminder of the impact of regulatory action: Binance\u2019s share of the crypto trading market has fallen from roughly 57 per cent to 38 per cent following the New York Department of Financial Services aiming its crosshairs on BUSD.\n\nSoundbite of the week: Crypto gets its latest cheerleader\n\nCrypto has a new high-profile political supporter: Vivek Ramaswamy. The biotech entrepreneur turned Republican presidential candidate has made waves for describing the climate \u201cagenda\u201d as a \u201clie\u201d, and outlandish promises to fire 75 per cent of all US federal government employees.\n\nRamaswamy took to social media platform X this week to celebrate Grayscale\u2019s victory in court over the SEC, suggesting the federal courts (presumably he\u2019d like to keep those running) as the only defence against overreaching agencies such as the SEC.\n\n\u201cThe shadow government in D.C. is out of control & the federal courts are our *only* remaining line of defence against the unlawful rogue behaviours of 3-letter government agencies. This decision is strong and clears a path to keep Bitcoin & blockchain innovation in the US instead of overseas.\u201d\n\nData mining: Grayscale added over $1bn in AUM after court victory\n\nGrayscale\u2019s flagship vehicle, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, added nearly $1.2bn in assets under management on August 29 and 30 following the asset manager\u2019s victory in the courts. That added 7 per cent to its total, bringing it to $17.4bn in assets under management, according to figures from provider CCData.\n\nStill, that was only a minor ray of sunshine in a poor August. The digital asset market had a 12 per cent decline in assets under management last month, to $29.7bn. Grayscale itself was managing more than $18bn only two weeks ago.\n\n\n\nFT Cryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford. Please send any thoughts and feedback to cryptofinance@ft.com."

        "title": "The SEC got spanked over Bitcoin ETFs. Now what? - Fortune",
        "content": "The crypto world is still reveling after Grayscale\u2019s unanimous court victory over the SEC this week. The decision, which saw an appeals court conclude that the SEC\u2019s refusal to grant Grayscale a Bitcoin ETF was arbitrary and unfounded, has resulted in a modest jump in crypto prices and no shortage of memes dunking on the SEC\u2019s embattled chairman, Gary Gensler.\n\nEveryone agrees the ruling was a much needed piece of good news for the crypto industry\u2014but what happens next is anyone\u2019s guess. For starters, the SEC has a 45-day window to appeal the decision to a larger panel of judges on the same D.C. court or to file an appeal directly to the Supreme Court. In this week\u2019s ruling, however, the three judges who issued the decision\u2014including the Obama-appointed chief justice\u2014issued such a sound spanking of the SEC\u2019s reasoning that the agency has no obvious grounds for appeal.\n\nThis means the SEC can either find another pretext to delay approving Bitcoin ETFs or simply fold its cards, take the loss, and save what\u2019s left of its capital for a different fight. As the Wall Street Journal noted in a withering editorial on the Grayscale decision, Gensler has already overplayed his hand:\n\n\u201cMr. Gensler is holding Bitcoin spot ETPs hostage in his crypto-market power grab. Until crypto exchanges register with the SEC, he won\u2019t authorize spot Bitcoin ETPs. Arbitrary regulation and regulatory overreaches are recurring themes of the Gensler SEC and the Biden administration. Is he trying to match Lina Khan\u2019s losing record at the Federal Trade Commission?\u201d\n\nGiven that an appeal is unlikely, the biggest wild card now is when and how the SEC approves the first Bitcoin ETF, which is widely expected to result in billions in new capital flowing into the crypto market. While Grayscale has been the face of the long-running legal fight, it is hardly the only one seeking to launch an ETF. Other firms petitioning the SEC to launch one include familiar names Fidelity and BlackRock.\n\nIn the case of BlackRock, the first deadline for the SEC to respond to the company\u2019s ETF application is this Saturday\u2014though a person familiar with the process says the company is expecting the agency will say it needs more time to examine the paperwork. The SEC already did this with another application, filed by crypto firm ARK, earlier this month. The upshot is that the crypto world must resign itself once again to the waiting game, and accept that the long-awaited capital infusion from an ETF approval will only come late this year\u2014or in 2024.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nRobinhood\u2019s crypto wallet, which initially supported only Ethereum-based tokens, rolled out capacities for Doge and Bitcoin, and will soon feature swaps.

        "content": "Bitcoin could be headed for a historically low month \u2014 particularly given some volatile macroeconomic factors.\n\nAugust\u2019s final trading day saw bitcoin give up its gains Thursday on news that the US Securities and Exchange Commission once again delayed decisions on a bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nMore broadly, September has been a red month for bitcoin for the past six years. The S&P 500 similarly struggles at the end of the summer, averaging a 3.2% loss in September for the past five years.\n\n\u201cEven in 2021, during the final upward leg of the last bull cycle, [bitcoin] (BTC) lost 7% in September only to gain 40% the following month,\u201d Noelle Acheson, author of Crypto is Macro Now and former head of market insights at Genesis, wrote in a newsletter Friday.\n\n\u201cTimes are different now, however. In September 2021, bond yields were around 1.1%, the S&P 500 was up a whopping 40% year-to-date, risk sentiment was high and BTC had already gained over 60% since early January,\u201d Acheson added.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is scheduled to release its next interest rate decision on Sept. 20, along with the central bank\u2019s summary of economic projections. Markets are currently pricing in 93% probability that the Fed will opt for another pause and keep interest rates where they are, around 5.25%.\n\nLast month, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the economy is proving more resilient than central bankers originally anticipated. He suggested more aggressive rate increases might be necessary down the line.\n\n\u201cSince inflation exploded last year, the Fed has been more closely focused on the so-called \u2018super-core\u2019 inflation rate, which is Core Services PCE less Housing,\u201d said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research. \u201cThat figure jumped considerably to 3.9% from 3.2% in June.\u201d\n\nThe Fed will lean hawkish, Essaye predicted, which markets and cryptos have not yet priced in.\n\nCrypto investors should also keep an eye on the growing US budget deficit, Acheson advised. An increased deficit means more debt issuances, but with lower global demand for American government debt and a central bank that\u2019s trying to cut its balance sheet holdings, buyers could be in short supply.\n\n\u201cTrue, the Fed could be encouraged to change its strategy in case of urgent need, in which case we would be back to the money-printing days of 2020-21,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cThis should lead to a scenario where yet again BTC outperforms stocks given its sensitivity to liquidity, its inverse relationship to the dollar and its detachment from the economic doldrums affecting the world\u2019s large economies.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are under pressure after the SEC's decision to delay applications for bitcoin spot ETFs for another 45 days. Bitcoin has fallen back below $26,000 after rallying earlier this week on Grayscale's (GBTC) victory in a federal appeals court. Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Jared Blikre breaks down the story.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Well, Bitcoin and other crypto assets under pressure today after the Securities and Exchange Commission delayed its decision on spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nJared Blikre is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange tracking that for us and much more. Jared.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: This just shows you how much we have to do on a summer Friday afternoon before Labor Day. These are filings that were largely expected. The SEC decided to postpone or deny the application that rolls them over into another day, it's mid-October for the next decision. But this regard a spot Bitcoin ETF, kind of the Holy Grail right now for Bitcoin lovers and Bitcoin bulls.\n\nIt was only a couple of days ago that we had that surprise, we had that decision. I don't know that it was a surprise, but it was a decision in the Grayscale versus SEC case, where they were suing to allow GBTC, that's a Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to convert to a spot Bitcoin ETF. That was approved. And so that could eventually go through, but that's going through in a different way because that has to do with the court system.\n\nNow, all of this actually started a few months ago in the middle of June. June 15 was the day that BlackRock originally filed its application for its spot Bitcoin ETF. There was so much enthusiasm based on that, that we actually saw a huge multi-day rise in Bitcoin. There are a couple other things going on at the same time.\n\nBut everybody else who was going to file a spot Bitcoin ETF, they jumped on the bandwagon within the next couple of days. And we saw Bitcoin go from $25,000 to $30,000 and just above.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut given some of the disappointments that we've seen recently, we've seen that fall off quite a bit. I said earlier in the week right before the big Grayscale decision came out. We probably don't have another big catalyst until something changes materially with the Federal Reserve or we get to the halvening next year. And that has to do with the finite money supply of Bitcoin. So another story indeed.\n\nGetting back to the main point, we're at about 25,000. 25,000 gives, there's not a lot of weight or there's not a lot of support under that until you get to about 20,000, 21,000, so we could definitely go lower.\n\nBut none of this really means that much in terms of price action between $20,000 and $30,000, $33,000 anyways. It's not until we push materially above, let's say 35,000, 40,000 that we can say we are out of the woods and probably emerging from the Bitcoin spring into the Bitcoin summer.\n\nNotice that I believe we have already emerged from the Bitcoin winter. So enough on crypto there. I don't know if we're going to get any big decisions or anything else that will move the market next week, not maybe CPI. But that kind of brings me back to today. I said the Federal Reserve, if it change interest rate policy, that's going to affect all risk assets, not just Bitcoin.\n\nAnd what we saw this morning was a rise in yields. I don't think this morning's report changes the game for the Federal Reserve. If anything, it takes some pressure off of them. But with regard to risk assets, summer is over. We know that we're entering September, October, that's when portfolio managers finally rejigger their portfolios from over the summer when they're dealing with that low liquidity.\n\nSo any number of things can happen over the coming weeks and months. Finally, I would add. I'd just remind everybody, September worst month of the year going back to 1950. Yes. However, when you filter for a couple other variables like the market being strong through July and falling off in August, we actually have pretty good results throughout the end of the year.\n\nSo I think a little bit of caution is warranted. Not too much of expectations is warranted with regard to Bitcoin and ceteris paribus for everything else.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Important for a lot of investors to take a deep breath going into the long weekend and bracing for September. Jared, thanks so much for that."

        "title": "BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF application: a rocky way towards approval - Finextra",
        "content": "BlackRock, the world largest asset manager, last June has applied at the SEC for a spot Bitcoin ETF for its American clients. According to Blackrock there is still large interest of their clients to have Bitcoin in their portfolio.\n\nIn the past years BlackRock has continuously pushed the boundaries of ETF offerings, reaffirming its position as a leading force in the financial industry.\n\nIn this blog a number of questions will be answered, such as the involvement of BlackRock in Bitcoin, why BlackRock is bullish on Bitcoin, what is a spot Bitcoin ETF, what are the benefits and what the drawbacks, what is the chance that the SEC will approve this application and if so what would that mean for the crypto markets.\n\nBlackrock and Bitcoin involvement\n\nThe distinguishing factor of BlackRock's application is its stature as the world's largest asset manager, with almost $10 trillion in assets under management. For that reason some analysts expect that the application of Blackrock will be approved, though not everybody agrees.\n\n\n\nNext to that Blackrock is very much involved in the crypto market especially Bitcoin. BlackRock\u2019s investment in Bitcoin mining companies has positioned the asset manager as the second-largest investor in the industry, just behind Fidelity Investments. This move is a testament to the growing acceptance and interest from traditional financial institutions as well as regulators in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin holdings are significant for several reasons. First, they show that the asset manager is bullish on Bitcoin because of its innovation and resilience as a technology and network. This despite the volatility and regulatory uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, Second, they indicate that BlackRock is diversifying its portfolio with alternative assets that have high growth potential and low correlation with traditional markets. Third, they signal that BlackRock is positioning itself as a leader in the digital asset space, as it has also launched several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track companies involved in blockchain and cryptocurrency. Fourth, BlackRock believes that it has a unique value proposition as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, an alternative asset class, and an innovative technology.\n\nBlackrock spot Bitcoin ETF application\n\nBlackRock thrilled the crypto community when it applied at the American Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) on 15 June to track the spot price of Bitcoin.\n\nBlackrock chairman Larry Fink said he wished to make it easier and cheaper for investors to invest in Bitcoin. Similar products to BlackRock\u2019s application were already launched in other countries, including Canada, Brazil and Dubai. A second important step was the announcement of a partnership between Blackrock and crypto exchange Coinbase, providing institutional investors access to Bitcoin through Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the custodian. This partnership enables enabling investors to trade in Bitcoin with Blackrock\u2019s Aladdin, the portfolio- and risk management platform of the company, offering institutional investors a trusted entry point with BlackRock\u2019s involvement. Coinbase will monitor and at the same time serve as custodian, ensuring market integrity and overseeing potential market manipulation. By doing so both companies make a bridge between the crypto world and the traditional financial system (TradFi).\n\n\n\nWhat is a spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nWhereas the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved several Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), spot Bitcoin ETFs are of a different order. Contrary to the futures ETF, where the price is based on future contracts a spot Bitcoin ETF directly follows the actual rate of the Bitcoin on the market.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF provides investors with exposure to the real-time price movements of Bitcoin in the underlying market. This kind of ETF offers a direct and transparent way for investors to gain exposure to the Bitcoin price.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF would directly hold and track the (spot) price of actual Bitcoins, which is the current price of bitcoin at any given moment, as opposed to ETFs tracking the price of bitcoin futures contracts, a number of which have received US regulatory approval.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF investment vehicle would allow institutional and individual traders to gain exposure Bitcoin without the need to actually by and store or manage actual Bitcoins themselves. It would give institutional investors access to Bitcoin without being confronted with complex store problems.\n\nFirst Reactions on the crypto market\n\nThe announcement of BlackRock\u2019s desire to initiate a bitcoin ETF and expectations of an approval by the SEC has had a positive effect on the crypto markets, leading to a swift recovery from recent Bitcoin losses. The Blackrock action triggered the interest of institutional investors, bringing more money of these investors to the market for Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. But there was optimism showcased by retail investors as well. This was mainly because of the anticipation of the demand that would be generated [by the launch]. As a result BlackRock\u2019s application had had a \u201cvery positive\u201d impact on bitcoin ETF flows and the price of Bitcoin. This caused the Bitcoin rate to increase to a 12-months high beyond $ 30.000, a 80% rise since the start of this year, while also boosting the price of Ethereum, Ripple and other major cryptocurrencies. European crypto-related exchange traded products also have seen a boost in flows after BlackRock applied to launch a bitcoin fund in the US. Europe-domiciled ETPs with crypto-related names had net inflows of \u20ac150mn in June, Morningstar data shows. This followed a similar trend globally, with inflows totalling $610mn (\u20ac560mn) in June and July, according to CoinShares data.\n\n\n\nApllications by other asset managers\n\nAt the same time the Blackrock application sparked a flurry of similar applications for such a product at the SEC from other asset manager firms in the US. These include names like Fidelity, Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise, Wise Origin, VanEck, and Galaxy, while others have refiled their earlier applications to address the SEC\u2019s concerns. This could further strengthen the case for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Drawbacks\n\nBut there is also a flipside. As long as there is no approval investors should be aware of potential drawbacks. These may include regulatory hurdles, and uncertain ETF approval timelines.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s history of rejecting spot Bitcoin ETF applications, with over 30 rejections, may raise concerns as to whether they will accept BlackRock\u2019s spot ETF. A spot Bitcoin ETF could also give traditional finance firms more control over the cryptocurrency space, harming the network\u2019s decentralised nature and original purpose of blockchain. This may raise debates over the benefits behind BlackRock\u2019s ETF introduction.\n\nBitcoin ETFs and the SEC\n\nUntil now, the SEC has given the green light to several bitcoin ETFs and other crypto exchange-traded funds. However, these have only been funds monitoring cryptocurrency futures or owning shares in companies with indirect crypto exposure. But spot Bitcoin ETF\u2019s are another storey.\n\nThe US SEC has stated to accept Blackrock\u2019s Spot Bitcoin ETF. This however does not mean it would approve this application. It only means that the SEC just will handle the application. This should be seen as the first step towards a possible launch of the Spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\n\nWhat may we expect from the SEC?\n\nWhile there are already spot-Bitcoin ETF\u2019s amongst others in Canada and Europe, a spot Bitcoin ETF does not yet exist in the US. Up till now the SEC is hesitating to approve such a product and called market manipulation one of their worries. Despite the SEC\u2019s history of rejecting spot Bitcoin ETF applications, there is growing confidence among market analysts that BlackRock's ETF application could be approved within the next six months.\n\nMike Novogratz, chief executive of crypto financial services company Galaxy Digital, said it is not a question of \"if\" but \"when\" the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve at least one of a handful of ETF applications. ETF manager Cathy Wood called on the SEC to approve all spot Bitcoin ETF applications simultaneously.\n\n\"The SEC\u2019s actions related to bitcoin ETFs should be done in a fair and orderly manner.\" \"I think the SEC, if it's going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once.\" Cathy Wood\n\nWhat may a SEC approval bring to the market?\n\nBlackRock's decision to file for a bitcoin ETF may mark a significant moment in the evolution of the cryptocurrency market. If the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved we may experience a number of beneficial ripple effects to impact the Bitcoin market.\n\nA SEC's positive decision will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications for the market and could potentially shape the future of cryptocurrency investments.\n\nMore institutional investors\n\nIf the SEC would approve Blackrock\u2019s application that would trigger more institutional investors to bring money to the market for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a more structural way, legitimizing the Bitcoin market and providing a secure and regulated entry point for investors..\n\nThe approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC could significantly enhance mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin investing, making it more accessible, thereby providing an easier way for traditional investors to invest in Bitcoin without the need for digital wallets or cryptocurrency exchanges, making it more accessible. This streamlined investment process would attract other investors ranging from those curious about cryptocurrencies to seasoned investors seeking a more straightforward way to access the bitcoin market.\n\nIt could trigger a wave of similar products in the market and could lend a new level of legitimacy to the Bitcoin market. A spot Bitcoin ETF could also unveil new types of investment opportunities, such as short-selling, where investors can bet against Bitcoin. This could add another dimension to Bitcoin investing and open up additional ways for investors to profit from the cryptocurrency market.\n\nPrice surge of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. would as a result have a \"material positive impact\" on bitcoin's price as well as that of other crypto currencies. Thanks to the expected growing interest of institutional and other investors this may trigger a firm price surge of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Some are expecting a rise of more than 400 percent and will go beyond the $ 150.000 barrier.\n\nAccording to Research institute Fundstrat the possible launch of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by could have a significant impact on the Bitcoin rate, and may rise to somewhere between 140.000 en 180.000 dollar. Much will depend within which period the SEC come with its decision.\n\nWaiting to a SEC decision: what are the chances?\n\nBlackRock's recent proposal for a spot Bitcoin ETF has sparked fresh discussions and speculation about the probability of such an ETF becoming a reality. Though a decision was expected in the first half of August the SEC will certainly extend the term. The real deadline, including all possible extensions, is 23 February 2024.\n\nSo we still have to wait some time to the final decision of the SEC. Yet, the road to approval is fraught with challenges, and the outcomes of this endeavour remain uncertain. This path to launching a spot Bitcoin ETF will likely be riddled with regulatory obstacles and opposition.\n\nIt is thereby important to note that the approval process for ETFs can be lengthy, and the SEC may request additional information or make further evaluations before making a final decision. The SEC will carefully evaluate the application on the basis of regulation and security measures.\n\n\n\nBut what are the chances for Blackrock to get approval?\n\nAlthough similar applications in the past have been rejected, the growing influence of big financial players like BlackRock could increase the chances on approval. The credibility behind BlackRock\u2019s experience in ETFs and its position as the world\u2019s largest asset manager, carries significant weight and credibility in the financial industry.\n\nThe SEC might view BlackRock\u2019s involvement as a sign of maturity and institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, which could positively influence the approval decision.\n\nIt is clear that the approval of such an ETF could validate Bitcoin as a legitimate investment, while it may bring more approved Bitcoin spot ETFs to the market with a very positive impact on the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIts endorsement of Bitcoin could encourage more institutional investors to allocate a portion of their portfolios to the digital asset, as well as pave the way for more regulatory clarity and innovation in the crypto space. Ultimately it could bring a revolution in the financial world.\n\nBut this prospect is at this moment anything but sure."

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries that mine the most Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin, and bitcoin mining in particular, has been one of the most controversial discussions in the past decade, with arguments ranging from it being the savior of private finance to it being considered one of the biggest scams in history. Regardless of what one may think, and despite volatile fluctuations, Bitcoin started to become mainstream in 2017, 8 years after its creation, when the first Bitcoin bubble resulted in explosive popularity, which in turned led to many people losing their life savings after the crash happened. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Bitcoin then reached its best ever run in 2021, with an all-time high of around $68,000 in November 2021, only to crash spectacularly over the next year as well. However, by that point in time, the demand for cryptocurrency, not just limited to Bitcoin, had increased massively, with other cryptocurrencies growing even more and major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) going public in 2021, and is among the best cryptocurrency exchanges and apps in May 2023.\n\n25 countries that mine the most Bitcoin\n\nCompanies driving Bitcoin mining\n\nFor Bitcoin to be created, it has to be mined, a process which has a significant environmental footprint and has been called out for being damaging to the environment. As cryptocurrencies were seeing their values soar, more and more people started to mine Bitcoin due to higher potential margins, especially in the countries that mine the most Bitcoin, and an important component of possessing the firepower needed to be able to mine Bitcoin are graphics cards, which is where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) came in. One of the only companies in the world with a market cap of $1 trillion, it's known more for being a top AI company right now, but is also famous among gamers and cryptocurrency miners for its GPUs. With enthusiasm for cryptocurrency declining as the value of top such currencies fell amid scandals including the collapse of FTX (even though it isn't among the biggest bankruptcies in American history) and the collapse of Celsius, there has been some impact on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, the cryptocurrency, while still far away from all-time highs, has had a new lease on life in 2023, with Bitcoin's value increasing and more people in the countries that mine the most Bitcoin once again increasing their mining operations, and while AI has been the biggest driver of NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) more than 200% YTD share price gain, cryptocurrency has played a part. At its peak, the use of GPUs were so in demand, even the SEC took notice with the regulator stating the company \u201cfailed to disclose that crypto mining was a significant element of its material revenue growth from the sale of its GPUs designed and marketed for gaming\u201d, and resulted in a $5.5 million fine.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne challenge that companies which produce equipment used in cryptocurrency mining is Ethereum's shift form proof of work to proof of stake will significantly reduce mining requirements and hence, a huge part of demand for cryptocurrency will end as the second largest cryptocurrency will no longer require it.\n\nCryptocurrency industry outlook\n\nWhile the top cryptocurrencies have performed brilliantly in the first half of 2023, it is important to remember that Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two biggest cryptocurrencies in the world, are nowhere near their all-time highs, and so far, have been a bit dismal in the second half of 2023 despite a court ruling against the SEC and in favor of the company which made XRP. Recently, another major cryptocurrency called Worldcoin was launched by the CEO of OpenAI, the company responsible for ChatGPT and the project focuses on identifying whether a person online is real or AI, something which is becoming an increasing concern in today's world.\n\nMeanwhile, though cryptocurrency is currently mainly focused on trading even while providing various applications, it is expected to move more towards nontrading uses as echoed by Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) in its Q2 2023 earnings call \"The first 10 years in crypto were primarily about trading, but we've seen our customer base shift its activity over time where the majority of our active customers now do something with crypto other than trading. My belief is that the next 10 years in crypto will become predominantly about nontrading use cases. So, what could some of those be? Well, payments is a big one. As the scalability of blockchain improves by moving to Layer 2 solutions like Lightning, Optimism, and Base, we'll see payments emerge as a larger use case. Getting more scalable blockchains will be as important as the internet moving from dial-up to broadband. We'll also see the rise of decentralized identity systems with decentralized messaging and social apps that will accompany those connected right into those decentralized identities.\" Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) has had an excellent performance in the first two quarters, which has led to its share price increasing by 120% YTD.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the countries that mine the most Bitcoin, we referred a study carried out by Cambridge University which shows the percentage share of each country by month.

        "title": "How Bitcoin miners can accelerate the energy transition - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin miners can play a role in the energy transition by using excess renewable energy to power their operations, reducing waste.\n\nEmbracing energy-efficient mining hardware minimizes carbon footprints and enhances long-term sustainability.\n\nPartnerships with local communities and governments foster responsible mining, boost local economies, and address environmental concerns.\n\nBy aligning with clean energy initiatives and sustainability goals, Bitcoin miners can accelerate the transition to a more environmentally friendly energy landscape.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Mining And Energy Consumption\n\nThe process through which new Bitcoins are created and recorded on the blockchain is known as Bitcoin mining. It also acts as the system for validating and confirming network transactions. To complete the process, miners compete to answer challenging mathematical riddles. The miner who solves the puzzle correctly earns the opportunity to add the following block of transactions to the blockchain, as well as freshly created Bitcoins and transaction fees.\n\nBitcoin mining\u2019s dependency on computing power is what makes it unique. ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) machines are frequently used by miners to conduct the difficult calculations necessary to crack cryptographic riddles. These calculations need a lot of resources and computer power.\n\nAs of May 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption was estimated at 95.58 Terawatt-hour (TWh) per year, according to Statista.com. To put it in perspective, 1 trillion watt-hours (or TWh) make up 1 terawatt-hour (TWh). An hour of use of one watt of power is equal to one watt-hour of energy.\n\nThe total energy used by the Bitcoin network is 95.58 TWh each year, which indicates that during the course of a year, the network as a whole uses around 95.58 TWh of electricity.\n\nRenewable Energy Integration In Mining Operations\n\nDue to their high energy needs, Bitcoin miners have the potential to accelerate the use of renewable energy sources. Both parties may profit from this relationship: miners get access to affordable, ecologically good electricity, and renewable energy projects obtain a steady market for their spare capacity.\n\nMiners can assist these initiatives in obtaining funding and growing their operations by supplying a steady supply of renewable energy. This interplay can hasten the switch to greener energy sources and lessen the environmental hazards of bitcoin mining.\n\nTo take advantage of their energy output, bitcoin mining companies can be strategically placed close to renewable energy plants. Solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal renewable energy sources all produce varying amounts of energy depending on the time of day and the weather.\n\nMining activities can help reduce waste and absorb extra energy during moments of high production. Demand response is a theory that uses excess energy that would otherwise go unused to help balance the energy system.\n\nSuccessful Cases Of Bitcoin Mining Powered By Renewable Energy\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s Volcano-Powered Mining\n\nEl Salvador powers its bitcoin mining using geothermal energy. Volcanic activity in the nation generates geothermal energy, which is utilized to produce electricity for mining operations. With this strategy, carbon emissions are decreased and a sustainable energy source is used.\n\nHydroelectric-Powered Mining in Canada\n\nMiners in Canada utilize an abundance of hydroelectric power (which is a reliable renewable energy source) to mine Bitcoin.\n\nSolar-Powered Mining\n\nMining operations are incorporating solar energy especially in areas with strong sun irradiation. It is possible to install solar panels close to mining operations to supply some of the necessary energy. Also, some mining operations use solar energy only during the day.\n\nWind-Powered Mining In The Netherlands\n\nThe miners in the Netherlands have used wind energy for Bitcoin mining. During strong winds, excess energy is produced by wind turbines, and mining operations can use this extra energy.\n\nHow Bitcoin Miners Can Contribute To Energy Storage And Grid Stabilization\n\nOne creative idea for energy storage and grid stabilization entails using extra energy produced by renewable sources for Bitcoin mining during non-peak times. By utilizing the inherent flexibility of Bitcoin mining operations, this strategy addresses the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources as well as the requirement for grid stabilization.\n\nMaking Use Of Extra Renewable Energy\n\nEnergy offset : On windy or sunny days, when renewable energy output is high, there is frequently an excess of electricity produced that the grid is unable to adequately handle. This extra energy can be used by bitcoin miners, preventing it from being wasted.\n\nOff-peak mining: Cryptocurrency mining is best done during off-peak times, generally when energy consumption is low. This is in line with periods when local demand for renewable energy may outstrip supply, providing a remedy for intermittent problems.\n\nBenefits of Providing Consistent Energy Demand:\n\nGrid stability: Mining Bitcoins can operate as a steady, manageable load on the grid, absorbing extra energy during times of peak generation and reducing demand during times of high demand. By lowering fluctuations, this stabilizes the grid.\n\nEnergy storage: By transforming surplus energy into a priceless digital asset (Bitcoin), miners can indirectly support energy storage. When energy demand is strong, these assets can be sold, potentially raising money for additional grid infrastructure upgrades, such as energy storage options.\n\nReduced energy waste: By utilizing surplus renewable energy, the idea reduces energy waste, which helps to use clean energy sources more effectively and lessen the need for curtailment.\n\nEconomic incentives: Miners can provide financial incentives to producers of renewable energy, making it feasible for them to generate excess clean energy and follow sustainable energy practices.\n\nHow Collaboration With Local Communities Help Reduce Mining Concerns?\n\nTo allay worries about mining activity, local populations\u2019 cooperation can be extremely important. Here are some advantages of such cooperation:\n\nCommunity engagement: Involving locals in the decision-making process promotes openness and confidence. Public meetings can be held by miners to address issues, solicit input, and make sure the community\u2019s perspectives are heard.\n\nEnvironmental impact mitigation: Through joint efforts, responsible mining techniques that limit environmental harm can be developed. Communities can help identify locations to protect and can offer useful insights into local ecosystems.\n\nEconomic opportunities: Mining operations frequently result in job creation and regional economic expansion. Partnerships with local businesses and local hiring priorities can strengthen the local economy and ease concerns about unemployment.\n\nInfrastructure development: Mining activities can aid in the development of infrastructure. Investments in roads, schools, and healthcare facilities could result from cooperation, which would be advantageous to both miners and locals.\n\nResource sharing: Collaborative agreements can specify the procedures for sharing resources, making sure that communities get a fair share of the advantages brought about by mining activity.\n\nEnvironmental stewardship: To leave a positive legacy for the community, cooperative efforts can concentrate on post-mining environmental rehabilitation and land reclamation.\n\nSocial responsibility: Miners can participate in social responsibility projects, such as helping with healthcare and education, to strengthen their ties with the local communities.\n\nEnvironmental Accountability For Using Renewable Energy\n\nMaking use of renewable energy sources is a big step in the direction of environmental responsibility. Carbon credits, which encourage the reduction of emissions, are frequently available to businesses that use renewable energy. The exchange or sale of these credits can result in financial gains while advancing a greener cause. It is critical to provide transparent reporting on energy use and carbon emissions.\n\nBy enabling stakeholders to evaluate the actual environmental impact, it promotes accountability. This kind of reporting not only makes sure that laws are followed, but it also shows that a company is committed to sustainability, which can draw in investors and environmentally aware customers. Overall, adopting renewable energy is a potent strategy for business accountability and environmental care, reinforced by carbon credits and open reporting.\n\nTransitioning To Sustainable Bitcoin Mining: Challenges And Future Outlook\n\nWhile there are many obstacles to overcome, switching to environmentally friendly Bitcoin mining offers an optimistic future. Addressing the industry\u2019s high energy use and carbon footprint is one of the challenges. To lessen their influence on the environment, miners are increasingly using renewable energy sources and cutting-edge cooling techniques.\n\nTo come up with acceptable solutions, miners, governments, and communities must work together. Sustainability is anticipated to be fueled by developments in energy-efficient mining equipment, strengthened regulatory frameworks, and the use of renewable energy sources. Bitcoin mining can become more ecologically benign and in line with global sustainability standards as the sector develops.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy adopting sustainable methods, Bitcoin miners have the ability to hasten the world\u2019s energy transformation. Miners may lessen their carbon footprint and help create a cleaner energy ecosystem by using extra renewable energy, implementing energy-efficient equipment, and working with communities and governments.\n\nThis change improves the environment as well as the mining industry\u2019s long-term sustainability, bringing it into line with the overarching objectives of a greener and more sustainable energy future.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhy is Bitcoin mining seen as energy-intensive?\n\nBitcoin mining involves solving complex mathematical puzzles, which requires substantial computational power. This process, known as proof-of-work, consumes significant electricity.\n\n\n\nHow can miners use excess renewable energy for mining?\n\nMiners can harness surplus renewable energy, often generated during off-peak hours, to power their operations. This helps maximize clean energy utilization.\n\nWhat are the benefits of energy-efficient mining hardware?\n\nEnergy-efficient mining hardware reduces power consumption, making mining operations more environmentally friendly and economically viable.\n\n\n\nHow can mining collaboration with communities promote sustainability?\n\nCollaboration with local communities ensures responsible mining practices, fosters economic growth, and mitigates environmental concerns, promoting a sustainable approach.\n\n"

        "title": "A Bitcoin Maximalist's Ode To Ordinals - Nasdaq",
        "content": "This is an opinion editorial by L. Asher Corson, a partner at UTXO Management.\n\nAs a Bitcoin Maximalist, I love Ordinals. Other Maximalists should also consider loving Ordinals, as they demonstrate Bitcoin's superiority in ways not previously possible. Ordinals enable functionalities that undermine the need for other blockchains to even exist. The use cases that were demonstrated on other blockchains are now possible natively on Bitcoin. Despite Bitcoin\u2019s strengthening position, some self-proclaimed Maximalists on X (formerly Twitter) bizarrely celebrated decreased network fees and declared Ordinals to have failed. This seemingly implies that Bitcoin might somehow benefit from a failure of the Ordinals protocol and lower miner earnings. But Ordinals haven\u2019t failed and the interest isn\u2019t nearly over. To the contrary, trading volume across digital artifacts, unique satoshis and BRC-20 tokens has been historic. According to cryptoslam which tracks on-chain NFT volume, Ordinals have done over $500 million of trading volume since they were launched at the beginning of 2023. Despite volume and prices being down currently, investors in the ecosystem are writing big checks to Ordinals companies. Xverse, an Ordinals wallet, just raised 5 million dollars on a 50 million dollar valuation from some of the most sophisticated investors in the ecosystem. It\u2019s far more likely we are at the beginning of this phenomenon than the end.\n\nWhat are Ordinals? It is a protocol developed by Casey Rodarmor (@rodarmor) that enables any data to be included in a Bitcoin transaction. It uses Ordinal Theory to associate that data with a specific satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) which can be owned and traded. This innovation enables the creation and trading of digital assets directly on the Bitcoin blockchain without a peg or a bridge.\n\nBitcoin Maximalists understand that there have never been serious contenders to replace bitcoin as digital money, and it\u2019s unlikely any will ever emerge. Viable altcoin use cases have never been based on having better monetary properties than bitcoin because that really isn\u2019t possible. Absolute digital scarcity is unlikely to be discovered again because the circumstances surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s creation were so unique, in part, because today\u2019s government understands the risks of letting a decentralized network grow too large and they won\u2019t let it happen again.\n\nOn the other hand, viable altcoin use cases are related to features that Bitcoin couldn\u2019t previously support. Some of those use cases that the market has indisputably embraced include: decentralized trading, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stablecoins, capital formation, borrowing/lending and on-chain leverage. Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, has done almost $500 billion in trading volume since it was launched in 2018. Additionally, Ethereum has done $43.6 billion in NFT trading volume, according to CryptoSlam!. Source: CryptoSlam! NFT data, rankings, prices, sales volume charts, market cap\n\nAlthough many don\u2019t like it, these use cases will exist somewhere because the market has an appetite for them. My strong preference is that they exist primarily on Bitcoin and not on other chains. It would certainly be better for Bitcoin and the effort to separate money and state, if there were not so many competing chains soaking up market share. Ordinals have the potential to not only enable these use cases to be built natively on Bitcoin, but also to surpass their altcoin versions in terms of implementation. These would be better built on Bitcoin because the protocol itself is more decentralized and secure than altcoins. Bitcoin has the largest market capitalization compared to all the other chains that can support the development of these use cases. But also better because these use cases will be tailored to the Bitcoin community and will therefore embody Bitcoin ideals of decentralization, immutability and permissionlessness.\n\nAlthough the protocol itself can\u2019t stop scams, Rodarmor purposefully built Ordinals with Bitcoin ideals at the forefront of his design decisions. For example, the Ordinals implementation of digital artifacts is objectively superior to the way almost all NFTs were implemented on Ethereum and other chains. Danny Huuep describes the properties of a digital artifact, all of which Ordinals meet, extremely well:\n\nSource: X\n\nImagine a piece of digital art worth $1 million, or imagine politically sensitive information like classified documents that detail government atrocities. Should these valuable or sensitive assets be distributed using technology that can easily disappear or that can be easily changed? The answer is obviously no. It\u2019s also somewhat obvious that over time, the best artists, developers , activists, and investors will gravitate towards technology with stronger immutability that is capable of protecting their creation, information, or investment for hundreds or even thousands of years. In the case of digital art specifically, they will migrate to digital artifacts on Bitcoin that store the actual artwork, instead of NFTs that just point to where it\u2019s stored on an off-chain server that could go down at any time.\n\nBitcoin stands alone atop the world of digital money, and the rise of Ordinals only cements that standing. This is not just about the idea of Bitcoin dominance in market capitalization terms, but the sheer dominance of Bitcoin's principles and the vast potential of its immutable blockchain. With Ordinals unlocking unprecedented opportunities within the Bitcoin ecosystem, I see a seismic shift on the horizon. This shift should make Maximalists smile.\n\nThis is a guest post by L.

Some crypto enthusiasts, however, are confident that Van de Poppe\u2019s information is not the case.\n\nTo determine the length of the current \u201cbear market\u201d in crypto, it\u2019s necessary to understand that there are different interpretations of the term.\n\n\u201cThing is, the terms \u2018bull\u2019 and \u2018bear market\u2019 are entirely subjective,\u201d Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan told Cointelegraph. \u201cIt can mean either the price has moved in the past or that the price is expected to move in a certain direction in the future,\u201d Greenspan said, adding:\n\n\u201cThe ambiguity creates endless opportunities for analysts to make pointless arguments in perpetuity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cointelegraph\u2019s market editor Allen Scott, one may view the current market situation as a \u201cmultiyear bear market now until a new all-time high is broken.\u201d Such a perspective suggests that Bitcoin has been in a bear market since reaching its historic peak near $69,000 on Nov. 10, 2021, or for 659 days. The period is even longer than the one mentioned by Van de Poppe, but it\u2019s still not the longest \u201cbear market\u201d based on such an approach.\n\nAs previously mentioned by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin once saw its price stay below its previous highs for a period of 37 months \u2014 or about 1,125 days \u2014 between November 2013 and January 2017. For over three years, Bitcoin\u2019s price failed to reclaim $1,000 after hitting the price mark in 2013.\n\nAfter reaching $20,000 for the first time in December 2017, Bitcoin again lagged behind the price level until December 2020, or for 1,095 days. But does that mean that Bitcoin was in a \u201cbear market\u201d during this period at all? Looking at the charts, one could say that Bitcoin was actually on the trajectory of hitting its all-time peak of $68,000.\n\nBitcoin price chart between late 2017 and August 2023. Source: CoinGecko\n\nAccording to another interpretation, Bitcoin may not currently be in a bear market at all.\n\nSome classic definitions suggest that a bear market happens when a market index or asset declines by 20% or more from its recent high.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin\u2019s most recent high occurred in mid-July 2023 at around $31,400. At current prices, Bitcoin is around 13% shy of that level. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has climbed 34% over the past year.\n\n\u201cIf you zoom out enough, Bitcoin is just one big green candle and has been in a continuous bull market since 2009. I guess those that focus on short timeframes might be experiencing a bear market,\u201d Jan3 CEO Samson Mow told Cointelegraph.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin soars in Argentina as Javier Milei wins presidential primary\n\nThe Bitcoin advocate also hinted that he sees the current market situation as \u201cvery bullish\u201d amid contributing factors like high inflation, loss of purchasing power, spiraling debt and adoption by nation-states like El Salvador. Mow also has his own definition of a bear market:\n\n\u201cA bear market is what high-time-preference crypto investors experience periodically.\u201d\n\nQuantum Economics\u2019 Greenspan supported Mow\u2019s remarks, arguing that Bitcoin has never actually been in a bear market. \u201cTaking the longest time frame for both past occurrence and future expectations, we can, however, determine that Bitcoin always has and always will be in a bull market,\u201d he stated.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market \u2014 Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs Could Propel Crypto Prices, Says Expert - ETF Trends",
        "content": "As has been widely reported, big news in the cryptocurrency realm arrived Tuesday when a US Appeals Court ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must consider Grayscale\u2019s efforts to convert the GBTC bitcoin index fund into an exchange traded fund.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t guarantee spot bitcoin ETFs will come to life. Still, the ruling suggested the SEC\u2019s reasoning for rejecting such funds is faulty. While the future of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. still hangs in the balance, it\u2019s clear Tuesday\u2019s ruling was a positive for bitcoin prices and other crypto-related assets, such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users and Decentralized Commerce ETF (BLKC) .\n\nBLKC makes for an obvious beneficiary of the Grayscale news. The Invesco exchange traded fund allocates 15.78% of its weight to the aforementioned GBTC. Alone, that fact underscores BLKC\u2019s potentially positive correlations to the SEC eventually approving spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 something some experts believe is now a foregone conclusion.\n\nBLKC Could Benefit from \u2018Landmark\u201d Ruling\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of praise for the appellate court\u2019s ruling in the Grayscale case. Some experts are going so far as to describe the case as monumental.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark legal win for crypto against the US regulator,\u201d said deVere Group CEO Nigel Green in a new report. \u201cThe court\u2019s decision destroys the SEC\u2019s central argument for rejecting every spot Bitcoin ETF over the last few years. This win paves the way for bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nShould the SEC ultimately give the green light to these ETFs, BLKC stands to benefit. This is not simply because of its large weight to GBTC. The ETF also holds shares of multiple crypto miners \u2014 an asset class highly levered to the underlying assets\u2019 price movements.\n\nFurther Spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why Tuesday\u2019s ruling could be a boon for BLKC. A slew of fund issuers have filed applications for spot bitcoin ETFs. If these funds are approved, the market could feel immediate, substantial demand for the largest digital currency. There are other avenues for BLKC upside as well.\n\n\u201cFirst, if Bitcoin ETFs are approved, it would open up the cryptocurrency market to a broader range of investors who might have been hesitant to directly invest in digital assets. This influx of new capital from institutional and retail investors could drive up demand for Bitcoin, leading to an increase in its price,\u201d concludes Green. \u201cSecond, ETFs typically involve the purchase of the underlying asset by the fund managers. If Bitcoin ETFs follow this structure, it could create a substantial demand for actual Bitcoins to back the ETF shares. This increased demand, coupled with the limited supply of Bitcoin (capped at 21 million coins), could lead to a supply-demand imbalance, resulting in a price surge.\u201d\n\nHe believes the first US-listed spot bitcoin ETFs could come to market in the first quarter of 2024, if not sooner."

        "content": "Following the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delaying decisions on several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, former commission chair Jay Clayton said he believed approval was still going to happen at some point.\n\nIn a Sept. 1 interview with CNBC, Clayton said major financial institutions backing spot Bitcoin (BTC) investment vehicles represented a shift in how retail investors could get exposure to crypto. On Aug. 31, the SEC designated a longer period in which it could review spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications from BlackRock, WisdomTree, VanEck, Invesco Galaxy, Bitwise, Valkyrie and Fidelity.\n\nThe commission has another 45 days upon publication of the notice in the Federal Register to approve, deny or again delay the ETF applications from these seven major firms. Clayton said he expects to see \u201cprogress on this going forward.\u201d The SEC can continue to push the deadlines on the applications until March 2024.\n\n\u201cAn approval is inevitable,\u201d said Clayton. \u201cThe dichotomy between a futures product and cash product can\u2019t go on forever.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitwise withdraws Bitcoin and Ether Market Cap ETF application\n\nClayton\u2019s argument echoed that of U.S. Court of Appeals Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, who, along with two other judges, ordered the SEC to review asset manager Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Rao said that the SEC had already approved BTC futures ETFs and suggested Grayscale\u2019s offering was \u201cmaterially similar.\u201d\n\nThe ETF application delays came in quick succession on Aug. 31, before the Labor Day holiday weekend in the United States. The next deadline for major spot BTC applications under review falls on Oct. 7, when the commission is expected to make an announcement about the offering from fund manager Global X.\n\nMagazine: SEC calls ETF filings inadequate, Binance loses euro partner and other news: Hodler\u2019s Digest, June 25 \u2013 July 1"

        "content": "Key Takeaways US SEC reviews numerous Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nIt eases entry for traditional investors.\n\nWith a Bitcoin ETF, investors can access BTC without direct ownership.\n\nThey may skip storage and security concerns.\n\nRegulatory concerns about market manipulation and volatility persist.\n\nAs the September 4 deadline approaches, in the wake of its defeat to Grayscale Investments in a U.S. federal appeals court, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is up against its first deadlines to decide on seven spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications.\n\nBefore the Labor Day holiday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission will respond to filings from Bitwise, BlackRock, VanEck, WisdomTree, and Invesco. Regulators may deny, grant, or postpone them.\n\nSince Bitwise\u2019s application is due on Friday, September 1, 2023, and the others are due the following day, it seems likely that the SEC will make a decision before the weekend.\n\nAnalysts and business observers believe the SEC will postpone its judgment once more. The authority had already given 21Shares a delay for its spot-Bitcoin proposal with ARK Investment Management in early August and had previously rejected other applications over the previous ten years.\n\n\u201cWe can expect to see more delays from the SEC,\u201d said Roxanna Islam, associate director of research and head of sector and industry research at VettaFi. \u201cEspecially after they already delayed their decision earlier this month on ARK\u2019s spot-Bitcoin ETF filing.\n\n\u201cWe must wait for the SEC\u2019s ruling on Grayscale\u2019s case before proceeding because otherwise, they might allow filings for spot-Bitcoin ETFs before those for ether-futures ETFs.\n\nCCN reached out to Bitwise, BlackRock, VanEck, WisdomTree, and Invesco for commentary but did not receive a reply at the time of publishing\n\nAnalyst Eric Balchunas said it won\u2019t be surprising if the SEC decides to delay.

Their project is a never-ending saga as an application approval is pending since 2021.\n\nAfter experiencing prior failures from the SEC because of worries about market manipulation and insufficient investor safeguards, this year marked the beginning of their renewed push.\n\nCathie Wood, CEO of Ark, is optimistic. She imagines the SEC approving several ETFs at once, with success being largely dependent on marketing skill and effective communication.\n\n\u201cBecause most of these essentially will be the same, it will come down to marketing and communicating the message. We are trying to get the word out there that our research is deep, and we have been doing it since 2015,\u201d Wood said .\n\nHowever, Scott Farnin, the Better Markets\u2019 legal counsel, expressed grave doubts. Farnin argued that the proposals\u2019 surveillance-sharing agreements were insufficient prior to the SEC\u2019s recent judgment.\n\nAs a result of its inflated trading volumes, concentration, and reliance on a small number of people and organizations, Farnin emphasized that Bitcoin is vulnerable to manipulation. He said that because of these characteristics, the proposed spot Bitcoin-based ETF is particularly vulnerable to abuse, putting investors at undue risk.\n\n\u201cThe principal beneficiaries of the crypto craze are the criminals who use it to facilitate ransomware, money laundering, and illegal conduct of all types. It is within this context that the SEC must evaluate the latest wave of Bitcoin ETF filings this month,\u201d Farnin stated .\n\nHe also urged the SEC to take into account Bitcoin\u2019s inherent weaknesses and to continue rejecting spot Bitcoin-based ETFs that do not adhere to legal criteria.\n\nGrayscale Files Lawsuit in Pursuit of Approval\n\nGrayscale Investments\u2019 proposal to turn its Bitcoin trust into an ETF was rejected by the SEC last year on the grounds that the cryptocurrency markets are too vulnerable to fraud and manipulation. Because the SEC had already approved ETFs that follow Bitcoin futures, Grayscale filed a lawsuit seeking the DC Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the decision, which the business described as being arbitrary and discriminatory.\n\nFor years, there has been a strong desire for a spot-Bitcoin ETF among members of the crypto community and outside supporters. They contend that it would not only help bring digital assets closer to traditional financial markets but would also make investment in Bitcoin more accessible to regular individuals.\n\nRegulators have continuously refused to authorize such a product, however, citing fraud and manipulation as some of the reasons. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who established Gemini, were the first company to file for a physically backed Bitcoin ETF in 2013. Similar to numerous other attempts by other issuers, SEC turned it down.\n\nElliott Stein, senior litigation analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, predicted that the SEC would put off making decisions \u201cto the extent that it can\u201d until a judgement in Grayscale was made by the court. He calculates that Grayscale has a 70% chance of succeeding in getting the SEC\u2019s rejection order overturned.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Entry Sparks Optimism for Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nWhen it filed in June, BlackRock Inc. put the race for a spot-Bitcoin fund into high gear. As the asset manager\u2019s nearly flawless track record of launching ETFs, some analysts hypothesized that this time, the applications \u2014 from BlackRock and others \u2014 could have a higher likelihood of being accepted.\n\nAnd the current excitement over the prospect of a fund has given businesses the confidence to experiment with more unconventional vehicles in addition to Bitcoin ETFs. Several businesses have submitted papers for funds that combine Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and/or Ether futures.\n\nAccording to some reports, the SEC will approve the trading of Ether-futures funds in October, which many see as a victory for the sector.\n\nAfter reaching around $31,000 in mid-July, the price of Bitcoin was standing at around $27,178 on Thursday. In late 2021, the value of the biggest digital asset reached an all-time high of about $69,000."

Notably, a July ruling by a U.S. federal judge classified XRP as a security when sold to institutional investors, but not when sold to the general public or distributed to staff members.\n\nFollowing the ruling, SEC Chair Gary Gensler was left \u201cdisappointed,\u201d with the agency planning to appeal the decision.\n\nThe disagreement between regulatory bodies adds another layer of complexity. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have been debating jurisdictional rights concerning cryptocurrencies.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler's assertion that \"everything other than Bitcoin\" falls under the SEC's jurisdiction as securities, which clashes with the CFTC's claim that cryptocurrencies, including Ether, should be treated as commodities.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies has prompted lawmakers to introduce various bills in Congress aimed at bringing clarity to the issue.\n\nHowever, these bills propose differing solutions, including categorizing cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities, and determining the regulatory authority responsible for overseeing them.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong these bills, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act suggests a process for classifying cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn the other hand, the Digital Commodity Exchange Act proposes the registration and regulation of crypto spot exchanges under the CFTC.\n\nMeanwhile, the Digital Asset Market Structure Bill introduces the concept of SEC certification for cryptocurrencies, ensuring sufficient decentralization before granting commodity status."

This was around the same time that Bitcoin (BTC) had reached an all-time high of $19,800, but by late 2018, the price had dropped to $3,100. Investors in cryptocurrencies quickly learned that CME derivative contracts allowed them to make bullish bets with leverage but also enabled them to bet against the price, a practice known as shorting.\n\nHistorically, the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals due to concerns about manipulation on unregulated exchanges. The growing significance of CME\u2019s Bitcoin futures market might address this issue, and recently, Hashdex has even requested a Bitcoin ETF that relies on Bitcoin's physical trades within the CME market.\n\nProfessional traders often use BTC derivatives to hedge risks. For instance, one can sell futures contracts while simultaneously buying BTC using borrowed stablecoins using margin. Other examples include selling longer-term BTC futures contracts while purchasing perpetual contracts, which could help a trader benefit from price discrepancies over time.\n\nCME overtook Bybit to become the second-largest BTC futures market\n\nCME has played a key role in the Bitcoin futures market since 2020, amassing an impressive $5.45 billion in open interest by October 2021. However, over the following years, the gap widened, as CME's Bitcoin futures market reached $1.2 billion in January 2023, trailing behind exchanges like Binance, OKX, Bybit and Bitget.\n\nMore recently, the Bitcoin price dropped by 12.8% between Aug. 16 and Aug. 17, leading to a $2.4 billion reduction in the aggregate futures open interest. Notably, CME was the only exchange unaffected in terms of open interest. As a result, CME became the second-largest trading platform on Aug. 17, with $2.24 billion in BTC open interest, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nBitcoin futures open interest ranking. Source: CoinGlass\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that CME exclusively offers monthly contracts, which differ from perpetual or inverse swap contracts, the most traded products on crypto exchanges. Additionally, CME contracts are always cash-settled, while crypto exchanges provide contracts based on both stablecoins and BTC. These distinctions contribute to the difference in open interest between CME and crypto exchanges, but there's more to the story.\n\nCME futures show discrepancies relative to crypto exchanges\n\nAside from differences in contract settlement and the absence of perpetual contracts, the trading of Bitcoin futures on the CME diverges significantly from most crypto exchanges in terms of both volume and pricing dynamics. The CME records an average daily volume of $1.85 billion, which falls short of its $2.24 billion open interest.\n\nIn contrast, Binance\u2019s BTC futures see a daily volume nearing $10 billion, three times greater than its open interest. A comparable pattern is observed at the OKX exchange, where daily trading in BTC futures reaches about $4 billion, surpassing its $1.4 billion open interest. This variance can be attributed partially to CME\u2019s higher margin requirement and the fee-free trading environment for market makers on crypto exchanges. Additionally, CME\u2019s trading hours are constrained, with a halt from 4:00 pm Central Time to 5:00 pm and a full closure on Saturdays.\n\nHowever, various factors contribute to price distinctions compared to other exchanges. These include shifts in demand for leverage among long and short positions, along with potential disparities in the Bitcoin index price calculation across different providers. Lastly, it\u2019s crucial to consider the solvency risks associated with the tie-up of margin deposits (collateral) until the BTC futures contract settlement.\n\nRelated: When will it be too late to invest in Bitcoin?\n\nDecember 2023 BTC futures, CME (blue) vs. Binance (orange) vs. Bybit (cyan). Source: TradingView\n\nNotably, CME Bitcoin futures have traded at approximately $280 higher than those on Binance for the same December 2023 expiration. Ultimately, the day-to-day pricing of BTC futures contracts hinges on several variables. While CME\u2019s trading volumes are trending upward, its pricing mechanism might not flawlessly mirror Bitcoin\u2019s price movements on crypto exchanges.\n\nGiven the intricate interplay of variables impacting its pricing and trading dynamics, it fails to provide enhanced price guidance to BTC investors.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin continues to outperform Warren Buffett's portfolio, and the gap is set to widen - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, celebrated his 93rd birthday on Aug. 30. Throughout his lengthy career, he has adhered steadfastly to a value investing strategy that bears some resemblance to the \u201cbuy and hold\u201d approach often associated with cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, Buffett\u2019s focus is on assets with strong earnings potential and investing in companies and sectors where he and his team possess a deep understanding of the associated risks, competition and advantages.\n\nThe question is whether such a laser-eyed strategy can outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in the long run. Moreover, investors should question why one of the greatest stock pickers of all time currently holds cash and short-term bonds as the second-largest position in his portfolio.\n\nAn interesting example of his approach is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s largest holding, Apple (AAPL) shares. Berkshire initially acquired these shares in early 2016 when Apple was already valued at over $500 billion, so the firm was far from being an early investor. Notably, Berkshire Hathaway continued to add to its AAPL investment in 2022, even though the stock had rallied over 500% since its initial purchase. This illustrates Buffett\u2019s commitment to long-term investment strategies, regardless of recent price movements.\n\nBuffet downplays nonproductive commodities as a store of value\n\nIn a February 2012 shareholder letter, Berkshire Hathaway expressed concerns about the devaluation of paper currency and discussed the limitations of gold as a store of value. It argued that gold lacks practical utility, with demand for industrial and jewelry purposes falling short of production, and its price is largely driven by fear-based sentiment, which leads to only temporary price increases. In contrast, investments in productive companies generate substantial dividends and returns.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway also noted that regardless of whether the future currency is based on gold, seashells or paper, people will always be willing to exchange a portion of their income for goods and services.\n\nRegrettably for Buffett, Bitcoin\u2019s price surged by 683% in the 12 months following his critical comments on the viability of nonproductive commodities as a store of value. Moreover, on a four-year horizon, Bitcoin\u2019s gains amounted to a staggering 9,014%.\n\nTo compare the performance of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s stock holdings to Bitcoin, considering Buffett\u2019s focus on earnings and yield, which is fundamentally different from the characteristics of commodities like gold or Bitcoin, this analysis calculated Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s stock performance using a factor of three to simulate a leveraged position.\n\nBerkshire (BBRK.B) by a factor of 3 vs. Bitcoin/USD index (orange). Source: TradingView\n\nIf an individual had invested $1,000 in Bitcoin (spot) and initiated a leveraged long position in Berkshire Hathaway shares in early 2019, the investor would have observed a return of $7,020 in BTC compared with $5,623 in Buffett\u2019s holding company.\n\nBerkshire (BBRK.B) by a factor of 3 vs. Bitcoin/USD index (orange). Source: TradingView\n\nSimilarly, for an investment starting in 2017, it would have resulted in $3,798 in BTC, as opposed to $1,998 using the leveraged long strategy in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shares.\n\nThe apparent inconsistency in Buffett\u2019s strategy is bullish for Bitcoin\n\nIt\u2019s important to note a potential loophole in Buffett\u2019s investment thesis: Berkshire Hathaway is currently maintaining a record-high $147 billion in cash equivalents and short-term investments, representing 18.5% of the company\u2019s total market capitalization. This raises questions about whether it is waiting for better entry points into selected stocks or if it deems the 5.25% returns on fixed-income investments to be satisfactory.\n\nThis scenario highlights that even the most accomplished stock market investors may have reservations about deploying their cash. It also prompts questions about whether some of the funds currently on the sidelines, including the $5.6 trillion in money market funds, might seek alternative forms of protection if inflation makes a resurgence.\n\nBitcoin may not be a perfect store of value, and its volatility has been a subject of concern. Additionally, it\u2019s essential to acknowledge that Bitcoin has yet to face a global economic recession, making it premature to pass definitive judgment.\n\nHowever, the consistent outperformance of Bitcoin\u2019s price compared to Berkshire Hathaway shares suggests that investors are increasingly viewing it as a viable alternative store of value.\n\nIn light of this, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s substantial cash position serves as a potential cautionary note for those skeptical about Bitcoin. With Bitcoin\u2019s total market capitalization currently standing at $500 billion, it signals significant and untapped potential for it to play a larger role in the financial landscape.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Analysts speculate that the ruling out of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals could mean the SEC will ultimately approve the numerous applications for spot bitcoin ETFs currently in limbo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin hasn't been able to find solid footing this summer after soaring about 80% in the first half of the year. Still, even with July and August's losses, the token has gained more the 54% year-to-date.\n\nIt wasn't just bitcoin feeling the pain of the August sell-off. Other tokens, including ether, solana, and dogecoin all slumped, with each of the tokens sliding further Friday. The end-of-week dip comes after the SEC announced late Thursday that it would delay deciding on all of its spot bitcoin ETF applications until October. Applicants included BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, and other firms.\n\nStill, with bitcoin's halving event set to happen in April 2024, many executives and strategists remain bullish in their long-term outlook. Joe Kelly, the cofounder of financial services firm Unchained, said the token could breach the six-figure mark a year after halving.\n\n\"Taking a conservative view, if bitcoin stays around $30K until the halving, even a 12-month post-halving increase of 250% \u2014 which, again, is conservative relative to previous halvings \u2014 would price bitcoin at $105K,\" Kelly wrote in an August note."

        "content": "After the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of digital asset management firm Grayscale in a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in regards to a bitcoin spot exchange traded fund (ETF), the firm\u2019s chief legal officer Craig Salm expects the regulator to approve the ETF.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of when, not a matter of if,\u201d bitcoin spot ETFs will be approved in the U.S., Salm told me on TechCrunch\u2019s Chain Reaction podcast.\n\nThe new verdict was in response to Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit against the SEC, which denied the firm\u2019s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF on June 29, 2022. The court ruled 3-0 in favor of Grayscale, which currently owns 3.4% of outstanding bitcoin \u201cworth tens of billions of dollars,\u201d according to the legal filing.\n\n\u201c[The ruling] is a huge win for us, our shareholders and really the whole crypto community. Right now, we\u2019re focused on finishing those final steps to get this conversion to happen,\u201d Salm said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should wait any longer to let that happen, especially now that we have this paving of the road to an ETF conversion.\u201d\n\nThe exact timeline is difficult to predict, as the ruling is subject to a 45-day review period, Salm noted. But if there\u2019s no \u201crehearing,\u201d then it will be smooth sailing for the company. Bloomberg ETF analysts increased their odds from 65% to 75% that the SEC will approve a bitcoin spot ETF this year and are betting on odds of 95% by the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cMy view is that this should happen as soon as possible because we have investors today. GBTC represents nearly a million investors across all 50 states,\u201d Salm said. \u201cBut because the product is not an ETF today, it is trading at a discount.\u201d\n\nOn August 30, GBTC traded at a 19.5% discount to the value of its underlying coin, according to YCharts data. Narrowing that discount through a conversion of GBTC into an ETF would represent \u201cbillions of dollars of value being returned to shareholders,\u201d Salm said.\n\nAs for the actual crypto asset, bitcoin\u2019s price rose over 7% on the week after the ruling was announced, but has since retracted to a 4% gain during the past seven days.\n\nGrayscale getting an approval to launch a bitcoin ETF could also boost demand for cryptocurrencies in general. Institutional investors being able to offer (and use) a bitcoin spot ETF in a regulated manner could open the door to traditional financial players, who may have not been able to purchase the cryptocurrency so far due to regulatory constraints, among other reasons.\n\nSure, not every big firm or individual investor will buy bitcoin, but even a small percentage of the trillions of dollars in the financial market will have a massive effect on the supply and demand for bitcoin trading, potentially bolstering its value.\n\nTo that point, over the years, ETF wrappers have proven to be a great way for investors to access any asset class, whether it\u2019s bonds, commodities, securities or cryptocurrencies, Salm said. \u201cIt opens up the universe of investors that can invest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of investors that are more regulated, more institutional, that really need that ETF wrapper [around crypto assets] in their brokerage account with all their other investments if they\u2019re going to make an investment into bitcoin.\u201d\n\nNew investors who buy bitcoin through an ETF \u2014 if it gets approved \u2014 will create a network effect, Salm believes. \u201cThe more people who use [bitcoin], the more usable it becomes, the more valuable and the healthier the whole ecosystem becomes. \u201d\n\nWhile the crypto community, particularly the companies that have applied to form bitcoin spot ETFs, are hopeful this will open the door to traditional investors, there\u2019s no guarantee that we\u2019ll see these ETFs being approved across the board. However, it seems likely that at least more than one will see the light of day soon enough if things work out in the crypto industry\u2019s favor.\n\nThis story was inspired by an episode of TechCrunch\u2019s podcast, Chain Reaction.

The top gainers were Toncoin (TON), Maker (MKR), and Mantle (MNT) with gains of 21.4%, 14.9%, and 8.7% respectively.\n\nKuCoin (KCS) suffered the heaviest loss with 21.2%, followed by Hedera (HBAR) with 14.3%, and Kaspa (KASO with 9.4%.\n\nThe market cap of DeFi assets also finished the week where it started with $42.8M after pushing up to $44.5M.\n\nDespite the late-week retracement, four DeFi assets rallied more than 40% for the week among eight double-digit gainers, with Unifi Protocol (UNFI), Tellor Tributes (TRV), and Joe (JOE) topping the list. InSure (SURE) was the week\u2019s worst-performing DeFi asset with a 14.5% loss, followed by Redacted (BTRFLY) with 12.7%, and Gains Network (GNS) with 11.2%.\n\nMarkets Erase Weekly Gains After SEC Delays Bitcoin ETF Decisions\n\nYesterday\u2019s bearish momentum put a dampener on celebrations after a U.S. judge ruled against the SEC in Grayscale\u2019s challenge to the SEC\u2019s decision to reject its application for a Bitcoin ETF on Tuesday.\n\nGrayscale, a top crypto asset manager, argued that its proposed exchange-traded fund was \u201cmaterially similar\u201d to exchange-traded products tracking Bitcoin futures that the SEC approved last year.\n\nThe judge shared Grayscale\u2019s assessment, describing the SEC\u2019s decision to deny the ETF as \u201carbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nzkSync Challenges Ethereum\u2019s Throughput Dominance\n\nMany of Ethereum\u2019s top Layer 2s witnessed impressive growth over the week.\n\nzkSync Era is giving the Ethereum mainnet a run for its money, processing 28.5M transactions over the past 30 days, compared to Ethereum\u2019s 30.9M, according to L2beat. Era also posted a record daily throughput of 15.2 transactions per second (TPS) on Aug. 26.\n\nStarknet\u2019s throughput pushed to a daily record high of 8.5 TPS on Aug. 31 to rank second, a 53.5% gain compared to seven days ago.\n\nMarkets Erase Weekly Gains After SEC Delays Bitcoin ETF Decisions\n\nThe recent frenzy of activity on Base, Coinbase\u2019s recently launched L2, appears to have subsided. The network processed 5.6 TPS over the past 24 hours, down from a high of 15.9 TPS on Aug. 21. However, when coupled with Optimism \u2014 its Superchain sister network, the pair drove 10.5 TPS yesterday.\n\nCombined L2 throughput tagged 53.5 TPS on Aug. 31, just shy of last week\u2019s all-time high of 54 TPS, despite the decline in activity on Base.\n\nL2 TVL Consolidates Below $10B\n\nThe total value locked in Ethereum L2s is at $9.6B, down from a record high of $10.7B at the start of the month.\n\nBase was the week\u2019s top gainer with $359M, a 47.6% increase. The spike was driven by the launch of liquidity mining rewards from the Aerodrome DEX, overtaking its Optimism-based predecessor, Velodrome, within two days. Aerodrome is now Base\u2019s top protocol by TVL with $203.8M, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nHowever, combined DeFi TVL trended sideways near $38B this week.\n\nEthereum\u2019s burn rate also remained steady over the past seven days, with only 417.4 Ether ($690,000) removed from supply, according to Ultra Sound Money.

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decisions on six applications for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nAccording to SEC filings dated Aug. 31, the commission has designated a longer period in which it may review spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF applications from WisdomTree, VanEck, Invesco Galaxy, Bitwise and Valkyrie, as well as the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust proposed by Fidelity. The SEC will have another 45 days upon publication in the Federal Register to consider the proposed rule changes allowing listing of the investment vehicles, giving the regulator until October to approve, deny or delay a decision.\n\nThe delays followed speculation that the SEC could approve a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. for the first time after the commission lost a crucial court case brought by asset manager Grayscale. An appellate court ruled on Aug. 29 the SEC would need to review Grayscale\u2019s petition to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF, leading many experts to suggest the odds for approval of at least one spot crypto ETF had significantly increased.\n\nJUST IN: SEC is opting to delay (as expected) on spot bitcoin ETF deadlines pic.twitter.com/W4JjOji6L2 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 31, 2023\n\nRelated: Grayscale wins the court battle, but what does this mean for a spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nWisdomTree\u2019s Bitcoin ETF proposal didn\u2019t get the SEC\u2019s approval following a 2021 filing.

The withdrawal of the ETF application was unexpected; however, in the filing, a statement read, \u201cThe fund seeks to provide investors with capital appreciation. There can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective.\u201d\n\nBitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan advocated for SEC approval of all ETFs in a recent Bloomberg interview. The ETF intended to invest in either Bitcoin (BTC) futures contracts or Ether (ETH) futures contracts, determined by market capitalization. Bitwise also collaborated with ProShares to launch another ETF around the same time.\n\nIn the withdrawal statement, Bitwise said:\n\n\u201cThe Trust no longer intends to seek effectiveness of the Fund and no securities of the Fund were sold, or will be sold, pursuant to the above-mentioned Post-Effective Amendment to the Trust\u2019s Registration Statement.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has delayed its decision on Bitcoin ETF applications from WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Valkyrie, VanEck, BlackRock, Bitwise and Fidelity. According to a SEC filing dated Aug. 31, the commission has designated a longer period in which it may review spot Bitcoin ETF applications from WisdomTree, VanEck, Invesco Galaxy, Bitwise and Valkyrie, Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust proposed by Fidelity, as well as BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF. The next set of deadlines for the SEC is in mid-October, but these may also be delayed to the SEC\u2019s third batch of deadlines in January or to the final possible decision dates in March, April and May of next year.\n\nBitwise was among the early asset management firms that lodged applications with the SEC for Bitcoin ETF products. Its January 2019 application with the U.S. securities regulator proposed a BTC-backed ETF tracking the Bitwise Bitcoin Total Return Index, which is calculated based on the value of Bitcoin derived from BTC transactions taking place on exchanges.\n\nRelated: SEC delays decision on 6 spot Bitcoin ETF applications\n\nThe company\u2019s proposed Bitcoin ETF was touted to draw market data from a number of cryptocurrency exchanges in an effort to provide a trusted representation of the wider cryptocurrency markets. The firm would also require third-party custodians to physically hold Bitcoin.\n\nBitwise\u2019s recent withdrawal isn\u2019t its first. Earlier this year, it submitted an application for an Ethereum Strategy ETF designed to invest in both front-time and back-time Ethereum futures.

Discover SCENE\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said it needs a \"longer period\" to evaluate several spot Bitcoin ETF applications, including those of BlackRock, Wisdom Tree Funds, Invesco and Galaxy Digital, and Valkyrie Funds.\n\nOne by one, the SEC disclosed delays today for nearly every outstanding spot Bitcoin ETF application, except for Global X\u2019s\u2014the SEC\u2019s deadline to respond is Oct. 7. Notably, the regulator saved BlackRock, one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, for last.\n\nAccording to filings from the securities regulator, it'll need until at least Oct. 17 to decide whether to approve or reject most of the applications. The SEC set a fresh deadline of Oct. 16 for Bitwise's application, while Valkyrie received a deadline of Oct. 19. The SEC would have otherwise been due to announce a decision on the applications before Saturday, Sept. 2.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this week there was a spike in anticipation for a spot Bitcoin ETF\u2014an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of Bitcoin\u2014after a court sided with crypto asset manager Grayscale in its own effort to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBut as experts have pointed out, the court ruling isn't the same as an approval and the securities regulator still has 45 days to appeal the judge's opinion. An appeal is possible but unlikely, Coffey Modica of LLP Joseph A. D\u2019Avanzo previously told Decrypt.\n\nMarket analysts, such as Bloomberg\u2019s ETF expert James Seyffart, said earlier this week they expected the SEC to delay decisions on the remaining Bitcoin ETF applications, as it digests the court order that poked holes in its reasoning for repeated rejections.\n\nThe agency has swatted down spot Bitcoin ETF applications since 2013, citing fraud and market manipulation concerns. But judges earlier this week said the logic doesn\u2019t track, considering the SEC has approved applications for futures Bitcoin ETFs since 2021.\n\nAs the SEC\u2019s delays came about, Bitcoin moved lower. As of this writing, the coin was down 4.1% over the past day at around $26,100, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SEC has recently delayed decisions for other spot Bitcoin ETF hopefuls as well. ARK Invest, the investment firm led by Cathie Wood, filed an application for the Ark21Shares ETF in June 2021. The agency punted earlier this month.\n\nWith several Wall Street titans in the mix with spot Bitcoin ETF applications of their own, including BlackRock and Fidelity, crypto\u2019s years-long quest to establish a spot Bitcoin ETF has gained momentum and arguably resembles a regulatory footrace.\n\nAs anticipation within crypto circles increased incrementally, so too have the odds of a regulatory green light. Seyffart of Bloomberg penciled in a 75% chance that a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved this year, giving the odds a bump in light of Grayscale\u2019s victory.\n\nStill, if the starting gun ever comes, firms like Grayscale have argued it would be unfair for the SEC to let one asset manager move forward while others are left waiting. In July, the company said all spot Bitcoin ETFs should be approved at once because the SEC \u201cshould not pick winners and losers.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to include the full list of Bitcoin ETF applications for which the SEC issued delay notices today."

MKR was up 5% and TON 3% over the last 24 hours.\n\nMaker\u2019s governance token has likely benefited from accumulation by wealthy investors.\n\nOn-chain analysis outlet Santiment reported that addresses holding between 100 and 10,000 MKR coins bought around 61,500 MKR tokens since mid-July, worth $70.9 million at current prices, per CoinGecko.\n\nToncoin\u2019s bullish momentum can be attributed to ecosystem development by the TON Foundation, the team managing and developing atop the Ton blockchain.\n\nThe Foundation released a Telegram-centric Web3 app store and also launched a community-driven initiative, Believers.ton, for promoting ecosystem development.\n\nMacro signals mean uncertainty for crypto\n\nThe global macroeconomic landscape also sent mixed signals yesterday, jarring all financial markets, including crypto.\n\nThe US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released key economic data that reduced the market's expectations regarding a potential interest rate hike.\n\nA higher benchmark interest rate eats into corporate profits while making low-risk instruments such as government bonds more lucrative, diminishing the future values of stocks and other risk assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index for July stood at 3.3%, 0.3% higher from June.\n\nThe PCE index is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, tracking the prices of goods and services that consumers purchase.\n\nWhile the inflation levels were higher than the previous month, PCE readings for July aligned with the market\u2019s expectations raising hopes that the Fed might pause on interest rate hikes.\n\nThe S&P 500 index traded slightly lower on Thursday, closing 0.16% lower at 4,507.67 points. While the dollar index (DXY) against other global reserve currencies gained 0.44% Thursday, last trading at 103.56 points.\n\nInvestors are now eagerly awaiting the August U.S. employment data scheduled for release today, which will provide more clarity about the potential rate hike decision."

The turnaround comes even with a favorable court decision this week that appeared to clean the path for Grayscale to convert the biggest crypto trust into an ETF."

        "content": "Share:\n\nEthereum records more long-term holders than Bitcoin, according to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock.\n\nWhile there is a notable increase across the board, ETH outranks BTC when it comes to large holders.\n\nMetrics such as percentage coins in USD, time held, and number of addresses were considered.\n\nExperts attribute this margin to Ethereum\u2019s DeFi dominance as the network offers more functionality besides being a crypto, unlike Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has shown a significant correlation with Bitcoin (BTC) price, tracing almost similar price actions with momentum indicators also aligning. A closer look, however, reveals that ETH has outranked BTC on several metrics, particularly where large holders or whales are concerned.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price outperforms Bitcoin on speculation that SEC may approve ETH futures ETF sooner.\n\nOn-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows a commendable rise in long-term holders over the last year, with Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin. Specifically, Ethereum boasts a stark 73.5 million long-term holders (those who have held the cryptocurrency for more than one year) vs Bitcoin\u2019s 33.61 million.\n\nWhen it comes to whales, ETH boasts 5,370 addresses holding between 1,000 to 10,000 ETH. BTC, on the other hand, only has 1,920 addresses with between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoin.\n\nETH assets by time held\n\nThe number of humpbacks (addresses holding more than 5000 ETH) is also very high: 106,000 Ethereum holders own between 10K-100K, compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 103,670 holders.\n\n108 addresses hold more than 100,000 ETH versus only four holding as many BTC.\n\nETH Addresses by holdings\n\nIn addition, six wallets hold over a million Ether.\n\nBTC assets by time held\n\nThe percentage of Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings in USD also paints a similar picture in favor of ETH.\n\nBTCassets by holdings\n\nPossible reasons for Ethereum flippening Bitcoin\n\nExperts attribute the disparity, which favors Ethereum, to the network\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) space dominance. Specifically, the proof-of-stake (PoS) token has more functionality or use cases than Bitcoin, which is valued only as a digital currency.\n\nAmong the applications of the Ethereum network include:\n\nHosting other cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.\n\nCreation and trading of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nDevelopment of decentralized applications (DApps) in finance, web browsing, gaming, and advertising, among others.\n\nProviding access to financial services, including but not limited to crypto-lending, yield farming, and initial coin offerings (ICOs).\n\nCreation and maintenance of digital identities for individuals, companies, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.\n\nThe share of ETH locked in the DeFi landscape is also vast, recording up to $22.31 billion, relative to Bitcoin\u2019s $162.6 million locked within the same domain. This explains why Ethereum has more long-term holders.\n\nBitcoin price is up approximately 31% year-to-date, while Ethereum price is up only 6.8% over the same timeframe. Needless to say, the variation shows that dynamics in the cryptocurrency market are not limited to valuation alone. Despite Bitcoin being the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has managed to attract more large holders."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBubble shooter (or popper) games have been a fan favorite dating back almost 30 years to Taito\u2019s Puzzle Bobble (aka Bust-a-Move), and the genre has corralled a new generation of casual fans on mobile. Now you can earn Bitcoin by playing them, too.\n\nA pair of games on iOS and Android\u2014Bitcoin Pop and Bitcoin Bay\u2014offer cryptocurrency rewards while playing, although beyond that shared premise they vary in design, amount of ads that pull you out of the game, how they each dole out Bitcoin rewards.\n\nAfter playing dozens of rounds of each game on iPhone, here\u2019s a look at how the games compare, and approximately how much Bitcoin you can potentially collect from each.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChill vibes in Bitcoin bubble shooters. Image: Decrypt\n\nBitcoin Pop\n\nHailing from Bling Financial, a company with numerous play-to-earn mobile games, Bitcoin Pop (iOS, Android) delivers a relatively straightforward rendition of the tried-and-true bubble shooter format. It tasks players with launching colorful bubbles onto the board above with an aim to match at least three of a kind, thus clearing them from view.\n\nOften, the goal to finish a level is to clear a certain number of special soda bubbles using a limited number of shots. Power-ups and other twists emerge along the way to shake things up, but otherwise this is a pretty standard riff on the genre.\n\nScreenshots from Bitcoin Pop. Image: Decrypt\n\nIt\u2019s loaded with lengthy, full-screen video ads, however, which pop up after nearly each level and take over your screen\u2014often for a minute or more. This means that you\u2019ll spend nearly as much time playing as watching ads, and you\u2019ll often see the same handful of commercials, including scammy-looking ones that promise to pay thousands of dollars for playing other mobile games.\n\nBitcoin Pop, however, can\u2019t make that kind of claim. After two hours of playing, I netted enough Bling points\u2014a little bit at a time after each level\u2014to convert to 233 satoshis, or 0.00000233 BTC. That\u2019s about $0.06 worth. You can convert your points into Bitcoin or Ethereum and send it to a Coinbase account, or otherwise cash out via U.S. dollars through PayPal.\n\nBitcoin Bay\n\nTHNDR Games, another company that specializes in play-to-earn Bitcoin mobile games, is the firm behind bubble popper Bitcoin Bay (iOS, Android). The premise is broadly the same as Bitcoin Pop, but Bitcoin Bay strikes a different tone and takes a distinctive approach to payouts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScreenshots from Bitcoin Bay. Image: Decrypt\n\nBitcoin Bay\u2019s vibe is centered around a beach theme with a feline hero, as you connect bubbles containing things like crabs, starfish, and shells. The end result isn\u2019t terribly different from Bitcoin Pop, but there\u2019s a bit more depth to the game here, including a world map that lets you go back and replay levels plus skills that you can upgrade over time.\n\nThankfully, Bitcoin Bay isn\u2019t nearly as overloaded with ads as Bitcoin Pop\u2014the video ads only launch every so often, typically after playing a few levels, and generally they\u2019re not as long or obnoxious here. The downside, however, is that I earned far, far less Bitcoin while playing.\n\nUltimately, I netted only 26 satoshis across two hours of play\u2014that\u2019s less than $0.01 worth of Bitcoin. As with other THNDR games, you earn in-game tickets for completing levels, and those are put into an hourly raffle to claim a share of potentially thousands of satoshis. Earnings can be cashed out to the ZBD wallet or Cash App, for example, but you must withdraw any Bitcoin within a week of earning\u2014otherwise, you lose it.\n\nWhich should you play?\n\nI had a lot more fun with Bitcoin Bay, which has an appealing vibe and way fewer ads, but I earned almost 10 times as much Bitcoin playing Bitcoin Pop for the same amount of time. Bitcoin Bay\u2019s raffle model means that your mileage may vary, however. Had I hit the jackpot while playing, I would have netted significantly more satoshis than in Bitcoin Pop.\n\nBut ultimately, I only earned approximately $0.07 worth of Bitcoin between the two games across four total hours of play. Neither game is going to give you much cryptocurrency in exchange for playing and viewing ads.\n\nUnless you\u2019re dead set on stacking sats very, very gradually, you might have more fun playing one of the many bubble shooters on the iOS App Store or Android Play Store that isn\u2019t built around Bitcoin\u2014but might be more polished or robust, or lack so many intrusive interruptions."

        "content": "Create an account to save your articles.\n\nCreate an account to save your articles.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAfter three years, the University of Cambridge has implemented a major update to its Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) to more accurately assess the global energy footprint of Bitcoin miners.\n\nThe conclusion?\n\nThe previous power estimates were greatly overestimated.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe first and most noticeable discrepancy appears in 2021, where our previous CBECI model estimated an electricity consumption of 104 terawatt-hours (TWh), 15.0 TWh higher than the revised model estimate (89.0 TWh),\u201d the report read.\n\nA terawatt-hour (TWh) is a unit of energy equivalent to outputting one trillion watts for one hour. For context, if used for one hour per day, an average incandescent lightbulb consumes 21,900 watthours in a year.\n\nThe university\u2019s 2022 power estimate was also adjusted down by 9.8 TWh, from 105.3 TWh to 95.5 TWh, putting Bitcoin\u2019s electricity consumption that year in roughly the same league as U.S. tumble dryers (108TWh).\n\nThe need for revision arose from the university\u2019s former methodology that every \u201cprofitable\u201d hardware model released within the past five years \u201cequally fueled the network hashrate.\u201d\n\nThough effective for most of Bitcoin\u2019s lifespan, the methodology started exhibiting shortcomings in 2021 after China\u2019s mining ban.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis led to overestimating the number of older hardware and underestimating the proportion of newer hardware,\u201d the report\u2019s author Alexander Neumueller told Decrypt.\n\nASIC hardware devices have become \u201cconsiderably more efficient\u201d and powerful over time. ASICs are \u201cApplication Specific Integrated Circuits,\" machines specially designed to mine Bitcoin as efficiently as possible.\n\nGiven that the ban created a shortage in data center capacity, Cambridge said it is \u201creasonable to infer that mining operators would have already replaced all old machines with newer models.\u201d\n\nCambridge model good, but not perfect\n\nShortcomings also emerged during \u201cexceptionally profitable mining periods,\u201d when the old hardware distribution estimates presented a \u201cdisproportionally large number of older devices.\u201d\n\nWith its new methodology, Cambridge incorporated recent hardware mining deliveries, though many \u201cassumptions and simplifications\u201d still applied.\n\nNevertheless, the report\u2019s findings reinforce those from a Coin Metrics study in June, which used the blockchain-based fingerprints left behind by mining machines to determine which hardware was dominating the network.\n\nThough the report\u2019s findings were not incorporated into Cambridge\u2019s new methodology, Neumueller said that he holds the Coin Metrics authors\u2019 work in \u201chigh regard.\u201d\n\nKarim Helmy\u2014lead author of the Coin Metrics report\u2014told Decrypt that he was glad to see Cambridge\u2019s updated figures taking public company hardware data into account.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, he believes its figures are still inaccurate.\n\n\u201cThe new methodology continues to overestimate energy consumption in bull markets,\u201d he said.\n\nFor example, Cambridge estimated a \u201cconsiderable increase in energy consumption per terahash\u201d between 2020 and 2021 which \u201cis unlikely to have actually occurred in practice.\u201d\n\nCambridge\u2019s findings were also supported by CH4 Capital founder Daniel Batten, whose fund invests in companies using Bitcoin mining to clean up the environment.\n\nHis model estimates Bitcoin\u2019s current power demand to be 13.095 GW, versus Cambridge\u2019s 12.89 GW estimate. This figure presents the power it takes for all active mining devices to function.\n\nIn 2023, Cambridge estimates that the Bitcoin network has consumed 70.4 TWh of energy\u2013so far."

        "content": "You can watch the entire series here.\n\nMagnus Zhong: Hello, I'm Magnus Zhong, and this is Ian Tam. Over the past couple of years, we have heard of many cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Dogecoin. Should you buy some? Today, we are talking about cryptocurrencies.\n\nIan, is it easy to invest in Bitcoin?\n\nIan Tam: Hey, Magnus. Yeah. So, it is actually pretty easy to invest in Bitcoin. What you need to do is open an account on a Bitcoin exchange, which will allow you to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin. So, in terms of doing it, it's quite easy mechanically. But in terms of succeeding, it's actually quite difficult. Bitcoin is a very volatile investment. So, it will require some pretty detailed skill and expertise to be able to invest successfully.\n\nZhong: How risky is it? Can I become a Bitcoin billionaire?\n\nTam: It's a great question. And you know what? We hear a lot of stories about people becoming billionaires through Bitcoin. But I understand you're into football or soccer, so you know, like, Ronaldo and David Beckham. These are soccer superstars. But for every David Beckham, there's thousands and thousands of soccer players that don't quite make it to the big leagues, right? So, you think about Bitcoin in the same way. There are very few investors that can do very well with Bitcoin. Everyone else tends to actually lose money with Bitcoin. So, it's quite a challenging investment.\n\nZhong: How should investors consider things like cryptocurrencies?\n\nTam: Yeah. It's a great question. At Morningstar, we think about Bitcoin as a type of thematic investment. So, another example would be like investing in Big Data or investing in a specific kind of technology. These are all kind of thematic investments. And what my colleague Ben Johnson says about thematic investments is that you're really making three bets when you're investing. The first is that you pick the right theme. So, maybe Bitcoin will be the next big thing and make everyone rich. Maybe. We're not sure.\n\nThe second is that, that theme is not already over value, not overpaying for investing in that theme. And the third is that you pick the right person to help you manage your investment within that theme. So, those are three very specific bets. So, the probability of being successful at all three is actually very small. But if you do win out on all three, it ends up being quite lucrative for you. But again, the probability is quite small.\n\nZhong: Okay. Thank you, Ian. For Morningstar, Magnus Zhong."

        "title": "Bitcoin's Role in Economic Turmoil: Recent Events Put to the Test - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The financial industry is no stranger to instability and unpredictability, and recent economic turmoil has once again focused attention on Bitcoin's function in times of crisis. As traditional markets fluctuate and global events cause waves of worry, the question of whether Bitcoin can be used as a safe haven or a speculative asset becomes more prominent. In this article, we will look at recent events that have put Bitcoin's role to the test, as well as its behavior as an alternative investment during times of economic uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin, also known as \"digital gold,\" has gained popularity as a potential hedge against economic volatility. Bitcoin was created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to provide an alternative to established financial systems and its inherent flaws. It has grown from an obscure experiment to a prominent role in the global financial environment over the years.\n\nThe Allure of Bitcoin in Tough Times\n\nSeveral elements contribute to Bitcoin's popularity during times of economic instability. It differs from regular fiat currencies because to its decentralized nature, limited supply, and immunity to central bank regulations. As governments respond to economic issues by printing more money, some people are looking for alternative repositories of value, with Bitcoin being a notable contender.\n\nThe Impact of Global Events on Bitcoin\n\nA variety of global events have heightened economic instability in recent years. Financial markets have been rocked by the COVID-19 outbreak, geopolitical tensions, and inflation fears. During such circumstances, Bitcoin's behavior is frequently analyzed in order to determine its capacity to act as a safe haven.\n\nBitcoin's Transformation of Money in the Digital Age\n\nBitcoin has redefined the concept of real money in the past decade, challenging traditional fiat currencies. This shift is exemplified by its status as the world's first decentralized digital currency. While government-issued fiat currency has been the norm, bitcoin's influence is reshaping currency standards. Entities like X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook are key drivers in this transformation.\n\nBitcoin fulfills the roles of money: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Its scarcity, decentralized nature, and potential for growth make it comparable to traditional assets like gold. Despite volatility, its value has surged by over 6,000% since 2016.\n\nThe network effect of bitcoin is strengthening, with rising transaction volumes, merchant adoption, and market capitalization. Its hash rate continues to break records, showcasing its security.\n\nBitcoin's value is closely tied to its network effect \u2013 adoption leads to utility and value growth. With a capped supply of 21 million units and a transparent ledger, it functions as a globally verifiable monetary system.\n\nIn the digital era, bitcoin melds ancient monetary principles with modern technology, redefining the essence of money. It blurs the line between traditional and digital value, shaping the future of money.\n\nThe Performance of Bitcoin During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 caused extraordinary financial volatility. Traditional markets fell precipitously, and investors sought assets that could provide shelter from the storm. Bitcoin's behavior was erratic throughout the early stages of the crisis. It saw a steep decrease at first, raising concerns about its safe-haven status.\n\nHowever, as the pandemic progressed, Bitcoin recovered. Its rebound has been linked to factors such as increased institutional interest, acceptance by payment systems, and its perceived use as an inflation hedge. This revival highlighted the complex interplay between world events and the market behavior of Bitcoin.\n\nGeopolitical Tensions and the Reaction of Bitcoin\n\nTrade wars and diplomatic confrontations, for example, have historically caused market volatility. Traditional safe-haven investments such as gold and government bonds tend to attract investors seeking stability during times of increased uncertainty. As a newer and more volatile asset, Bitcoin has yet to fully establish itself as a safe haven in the face of geopolitical events.\n\nSome supporters, however, claim that Bitcoin's decentralized character and ability to operate independently of political pressures make it an appealing option for people looking to diversify their holdings.\n\nConcerns about inflation and the Store of Value Narrative\n\nConcerns about inflation have intensified in recent years as a result of expansive monetary policies and stimulus measures. As central banks print more money to combat economic issues, the risk of traditional currencies depreciating grows. Because of Bitcoin's scarcity, determined by its maximum supply of 21 million coins, some see it as a potential store of value in times of rising inflation.\n\nThe idea of Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" has gained traction, pitching it as a hedge against the depreciation of fiat currencies. Critics, however, contend that Bitcoin's volatility and speculative character make it a perilous investment for individuals seeking stability in the face of economic turmoil.\n\nSafe Haven vs. Speculation\n\nThe argument about Bitcoin's involvement in economic turbulence highlights its dual nature as a speculative asset and a possible safe haven. Its price volatility, which can be both a gift and a curse for investors, is a distinguishing feature that distinguishes it from traditional safe-haven assets such as gold.\n\nWhile some investors are tempted to Bitcoin's potential for significant returns during optimistic sentiment periods, others see it as an unknown asset class lacking the stability and historical track record of traditional havens.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs recent events continue to put Bitcoin's relationship with economic turbulence to the test, the answer to whether it serves as a safe haven or speculative asset remains ambiguous. Bitcoin's reaction to global events highlights the currency's expanding importance in the financial ecosystem.\n\nWhile it has shown endurance and potential as a store of value during specific economic downturns, its volatility and limited history create difficulties for those seeking stability. As investors and institutions traverse the complicated terrain of economic uncertainty, Bitcoin's position is expected to expand, sparking continued debate over its place in portfolios and its potential impact on the larger financial environment."

        "content": "Fri 01 Sep 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nA recent data analysis reveals that bitcoin reserves held by several exchanges are falling sharply. This trend could have major implications for the crypto market. In particular, exchanges could soon run out of liquidity and see their trading volumes plummet.\n\nIn brief:\n\nHuobi, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, holds less than 15,000 bitcoin.\n\nCrypto exchanges holding 20,000 bitcoin are at risk of depletion.\n\nDwindling bitcoin (BTC) reserves could lead to increased price volatility.\n\nA worrying situation for crypto exchanges\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, there are currently around 2.257 million bitcoin on all crypto exchanges. As such, exchanges with 20,000 or fewer coins present a heightened risk of depletion.\n\nHuobi, one of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges, currently holds close to 15,000 bitcoin. Other exchanges, such as Poloneix, Kucoin, Bithumb, Bitstamp, Gate.IO and Luno, collectively hold around 70,000 BTC. This is a more than alarming situation, as these platforms could very quickly find themselves in difficulty.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s clear that the dwindling bitcoin reserves on these exchanges are a bad sign for crypto. It could have a negative impact on market liquidity. Low liquidity means it will be more difficult to buy or sell bitcoin (BTC). This could lead to increased price volatility.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the drop in transaction volume could adversely affect exchange revenues. Platforms generally charge transaction fees to users, so their profitability depends on transaction volume.\n\nBitcoin users turn to private wallets\n\nThere are many reasons for the downward trend in bitcoin reserves. In fact, it\u2019s possible that users are withdrawing their coins from crypto exchange platforms and keeping them in private wallets. This trend would be explained by the recent rise in the price of BTC, which makes cryptocurrencies more attractive to investors.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that exchanges will be forced to sell bitcoin to cover their losses. This, due to the falling market for digital assets.\n\nAll in all, the decline in bitcoin (BTC) reserves on crypto exchanges is a warning signal worth keeping an eye on. This trend could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency market in terms of liquidity. It would also affect trading volumes, as well as the profitability of exchanges.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Prediction For September 2023: What To Expect - NewsBTC",
        "content": "After a short-lived rally above $28,000 this week following Grayscale\u2019s landmark court case victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the conversion of GBTC into a spot ETF, the price of BTC has once again settled around the $26,000 mark. This comes after yesterdays\u2019 SEC\u2019s decision to postpone all Bitcoin spot ETF decisions for 45 days.\n\nRenowned crypto analyst, Rekt Capital, has weighed in on the situation with a series of tweets that provide insight into Bitcoin\u2019s potential trajectory for the upcoming month. As the analyst remarks, Bitcoin has registered a bearish monthly candle close for the month of August due to yesterdays\u2019 price plunge.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction For September 2023\n\nIn a series of tweets, Rekt Capital explained, \u201cBTC closed below ~$27,150, confirming it as lost support. It\u2019s possible BTC could rebound into ~$27,150, maybe even upside wick beyond it this September. But that would likely be a relief rally to confirm ~$27,150 as new resistance before dropping into the $23,000 region.\n\nHistorically, September has not been particularly kind to Bitcoin, with the month recording the least number of positive-returning months at just two, and currently being on a 6-year negative-returning streak.\n\nRekt Capital delves deeper into this trend, stating, \u201cA frequently recurring downside amount for BTC in the month September is -7%. If BTC were to drop -7% from current price levels this month, price would retrace to ~$24,000.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to the analysis by the analyst, the next major monthly level is sitting at ~$23,400. This suggests that price maybe does not stop at -7% if BTC can\u2019t gain new momentum. Instead, BTC could potentially downside wick -10% in total to reach that next major monthly level.\n\nThe analyst further elaborated on the historical performance of Bitcoin in September, noting, \u201cSeptember \u2013 positive or negative month? Typically, we tend to see a negative month for BTC in September. However, for the most part BTC sees single-digit drawdown in Septembers. 8 out of 10 of the past Septembers have experienced downside. Only 2 months saw small, single-digit gains in the month of September (+2% in 2015 and +6% in 2016).\u201d\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nDrawing parallels with previous years, Rekt Capital highlighted that the most recurring drawdown in September has been a -7% dip, as observed in 2017, 2020, and 2021. However, he also pointed out that Bitcoin only saw double-digit retracement in 2019 (-13%) and in 2014 (-19%). The latter, being a bear market year, might not be the best comparison for 2023, which is shaping up to be a bottoming out year, akin to 2019 or 2015.\n\nAddressing the looming question of another potential crash in September, the analyst opined, \u201cIn 2019 BTC saw a -13% retrace but we also need to keep in mind that BTC just saw one of its worst-ever August drawdowns at -16%. It\u2019s unlikely that Bitcoin would experience severe back-to-back drawdown both in August and now in September as well.\u201d\n\nConcluding his analysis, Rekt Capital shared his personal forecast, \u201cI think a drawdown of around -7% to -10% September could reasonably occur from current levels. This would see price drop to ~$24,000 \u2013 $23,000.\u201d\n\nRemarkably, there is unlikely to be a Bitcoin spot ETF decision in September, which may be the biggest catalyst for the market at the moment. The next deadlines for filings by Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity and the others is October 16 and 17. Only an action by the SEC after the lost lawsuit against Grayscale could provide a surprise event. However, there are currently no deadlines or statements from the SEC if and when they will carry out the ruling.\n\nAt press time, BTC traded at $26,104.\n\nFeatured image from Finextra Research, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "How To Buy Bitcoin on Cash App 2023 - GOBankingRates",
        "content": "AJ_Watt / Getty Images\n\nBeyond just sending and receiving payments, Cash App, the popular peer-to-peer money transfer app, also enables users to invest in Bitcoin. This feature was first introduced in 2018, making it simple for novice and seasoned investors alike to buy and sell the cryptocurrency with just a few quick taps on their smartphones.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how to buy Bitcoin on Cash App, read on for a step-by-step guide.\n\nBuying Bitcoin With Cash App\n\nTo purchase Bitcoin on Cash App, you\u2019ll need to take the following steps:\n\nIf you don\u2019t already have one, create a Cash App account and link your bank account to get started. On the home screen, tap the Bitcoin tab and then the \u201cBuy Bitcoin\u201d button. Select one of the preset amounts or tap \u201c\u2026\u201d to enter a custom amount. Enter your PIN and tap \u201cConfirm.\u201d\n\nYou must have a balance in your Cash App account in order to purchase Bitcoin. Standard Bitcoin orders are placed immediately.\n\nOther Bitcoin Order Types\n\nIn addition to the standard purchase method, Cash App offers two other Bitcoin order types: custom orders and auto invest.\n\nCustom Orders\n\nWith the custom order feature, you can set your Cash App account to automatically buy or sell Bitcoin once it hits a target price. That way, you can buy low and sell high to capture gains or limit losses. For example, if Bitcoin is trading at $30,000 but you think that\u2019s too high, you can create a custom purchase order to automatically buy if the price drops to $25,000.\n\nMake Your Money Work Better for You\n\nTo set up a custom order:\n\nOn the home screen, tap \u201cBitcoin\u201d and then either \u201cBuy\u201d or \u201cSell.\u201d From the drop-down menu, select \u201cCustom Purchase Order\u201d or \u201cCustom Sell Order.\u201d Drag the slider or press the keypad icon in the top right corner to choose a price. Set a time period for the custom order to stay active. Review your order details and press \u201cConfirm.\u201d\n\nAuto Invest\n\nThe auto-invest function provides another way to schedule Bitcoin purchases. With it, you can set up Bitcoin purchases to occur automatically \u2014 for example, every two weeks. Once you\u2019ve navigated to the \u201cBuy\u201d screen, follow these steps:\n\nTap the \u201cChange Order Type\u201d drop-down menu. Select a frequency and tap \u201cDone.\u201d Choose a preset amount or tap \u201c\u2026\u201d to enter a custom amount. Then tap \u201cNext.\u201d Confirm the automatic purchase schedule.\n\nThe auto-invest feature may be right for you, for example, if you want to consistently invest a portion of your paycheck in Bitcoin or if you want to spread out your purchases to reduce the effects of a single day\u2019s price action. Note that auto-invest purchases must be for at least $10.\n\nTransaction Fees\n\nBitcoin purchase fees vary by transaction size and will be listed on the confirmation screen before you complete your purchase.\n\nWhen you buy or sell Bitcoin on Cash App, the price includes a spread, so you\u2019ll pay slightly more than the market value when you buy and receive slightly less than the market value when you sell. The price and spread may differ from what\u2019s available on other cryptocurrency marketplaces. Cash App also charges a fee for expedited Bitcoin withdrawals.\n\nMake Your Money Work Better for You\n\nStoring Bitcoin\n\nCash App functions as a Bitcoin wallet, allowing you to view and manage your Bitcoin balance within the app, all securely stored with private keys. The app is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Level 1-compliant, so your payment information is encrypted. Remember, though, that your Bitcoin balance in Cash App is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\nTransferring Bitcoin\n\nYou can also send or receive Bitcoin instantly when transacting with another Cash App user, as long as you know their unique \u201c$Cashtag.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, you can use the blockchain to deposit Bitcoin into your Cash App account from a crypto wallet by selecting \u201cDeposit Bitcoin\u201d in the Bitcoin tab. This comes with a limit of $10,000 in Bitcoin deposits over a seven-day period.\n\nSelling Bitcoin\n\nTo sell Bitcoin with Cash App, navigate to the Bitcoin tab from the home screen and tap \u201cSell.\u201d Select an amount you\u2019d like to sell and enter your PIN to confirm the transaction.\n\nFinal Take\n\nIf you\u2019re new to Bitcoin, remember that, as with any investment, buying Bitcoin involves risk. If you\u2019re an experienced investor, you should know that Cash App does not offer the ability to purchase any other types of cryptocurrency, though you can buy and sell stock on Cash App.\n\nCash App is a convenient and secure place to buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin.\n\nEditorial Note: This content is not provided by any entity covered in this article.

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin has come a long way since its inception in 2009. From being worth less than a penny initially, it has seen massive growth over the years with some dramatic ups and downs. Today, Bitcoin is emerging as a major alternative asset class and its future valuation prospects remain optimistic.\n\nThis comprehensive guide takes a data-driven approach to analyze factors affecting Bitcoin prices and makes educated projections about its potential highs and lows in the short, medium and long-term timeframes. With cryptocurrencies gaining mainstream traction, the report aims to provide clarity to investors on what lies ahead for Bitcoin prices based on historical patterns and developments.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nBitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency in the world. It was created in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who published the Bitcoin whitepaper and developed the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nBitcoin introduced blockchain technology to the world. The Bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions ever made. It is decentralized, meaning no single entity controls it. The blockchain is maintained by a global network of computers known as Bitcoin miners.\n\nKey attributes of Bitcoin include:\n\nDecentralized\n\nNo central authority controls Bitcoin. It is maintained by a distributed network of users.\n\nLimited supply\n\nOnly 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist. This scarcity gives Bitcoin value.\n\nPseudonymous\n\nBitcoin addresses are not linked to real-world identities by default, giving users privacy.\n\nSecure\n\nBitcoin uses cryptography and the blockchain to ensure the security of payments and ownership records.\n\nDivisible\n\nOne Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million smaller units called satoshis, allowing small transactions.\n\nPermissionless\n\nAnyone can use Bitcoin without the need for permission from authorities.\n\nThese attributes make Bitcoin unique compared to traditional fiat currencies and a promising digital asset for investment.\n\nFactors Influencing Bitcoin Price\n\nMany factors can affect the price of Bitcoin, leading to volatility. Some major factors include:\n\nSupply and Demand\n\nBasic economic theory states that when demand increases while supply remains constant, price goes up. As more investors and institutions adopt Bitcoin, demand rises. But since new Bitcoins are mined at a fixed rate, supply remains steady, driving prices up.\n\nMedia Hype and Public Sentiment\n\nPositive or negative media coverage and public sentiment can influence demand and price. For example, Elon Musk\u2019s tweets on Bitcoin often lead to price swings based on his views.\n\nMajor Protocol Changes and Upgrades\n\nMajor Bitcoin developments like the SegWit upgrade or Lightning Network adoption can improve Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities and affect price.\n\nRegulations and Legal Status\n\nRegulatory crackdowns or acceptance of Bitcoin in different countries impacts price as it affects demand.\n\nWhales and Institutional Investors\n\n\u201cWhales\u201d \u2013 entities holding large amounts of Bitcoin \u2013 can manipulate prices when they buy or sell. Increased institutional investment also drives up prices through increased demand.\n\nSecurity Breaches and Scandals\n\nSecurity issues with exchanges and wallets like the Mt.Gox hack or malicious business practices like the FTX collapse can erode investor confidence and depress prices.\n\nMacroeconomic Conditions\n\nEconomic instability and currency devaluations motivate investors to buy Bitcoin as a hedge, boosting its price. However, it has struggled in a hawkish Fed environment and amidst rate hikes.\n\nBitcoin Price Performance in the Past\n\nLooking at past price performance can provide insights into long-term trends and help predict future prices. Let\u2019s take a walk down BTC memory lane.\n\nThe Early Days \u2013 Volatility and Growth (2009-2013)\n\nWhen Bitcoin launched in 2009, it was practically worthless. In 2010, Bitcoin went from $0 to $0.39 and was extremely volatile in its early days.\n\nBy early 2011, it achieved parity with the US dollar, hitting $1.00 in February 2011. In the same year, it reached $10 and then $30. This early volatility was attributed to insufficient liquidity, scarcity due to the low Bitcoin supply, and lack of exchange infrastructure.\n\nIn mid-2011, Bitcoin fell from around $30 to $2 after a series of exchange hacks and thefts shook investor confidence. It took over a year to reach $10 again.\n\n2012 saw gradual gains up to $12 but also wild fluctuations between $7-$15. In 2013, Bitcoin entered a bull run from $12 to over $1,100 driven by increasing media coverage and adoption in the dark web.\n\nBut it ended the year around $700 following a China ban on financial institutions and payment processors dealing with Bitcoin. This cycle of rapid gains and dramatic crashes would come to define Bitcoin price performance.\n\nThe 2014-2016 Bear Market\n\n2014 kicked off with the collapse of Mt.Gox, then the largest Bitcoin exchange, after a series of hacks. This erased most gains from 2013 and caused Bitcoin to fall from around $850 to below $350.\n\nFor the next two years, Bitcoin hovered in the $200-$300 range. Increased regulation and lack of institutional interest kept mainstream adoption low during this period. Prices were relatively stable compared to past volatility.\n\n2017 \u2013 The Bull Run and Mainstream Mania\n\n2017 marked Bitcoin\u2019s entry into mainstream awareness and a massive growth in price to nearly $20,000.\n\nSeveral factors drove this rally:\n\nGrowing media and investment bank coverage calling Bitcoin \u201cdigital gold\u201d\n\nIncreased adoption in countries facing currency crises like Venezuela and Zimbabwe\n\nProposals for Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) drew investor attention\n\nLaunch of Bitcoin futures trading on major exchanges like CME and CBOE lent legitimacy\n\nLarge institutional investments \u2013 U.S billionaire Michael Novogratz invested $500M in Bitcoin in 2017\n\nDemand rose as Bitcoin went from being an obscure digital asset to a household name. But by January 2018, Bitcoin had lost over 60% from its peak following regulatory measures and other factors leading to a cool down from its previously overheated state.\n\n2018-2020 \u2013 The Crypto Winter and Maturation\n\nBitcoin spent much of 2018 in a bear market following the 2017 rally, trading in the $3,000-$6,000 range.\n\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny, exchange hacks, and coin scams contributed to falling prices. But this period also saw the maturation of Bitcoin with developments including:\n\nLightning Network launch \u2013 enabled fast, cheap Bitcoin micropayments\n\nIncreased mainstream institutional investment from firms like Fidelity and US Bank\n\nBitcoin futures added on Bakkt, Nasdaq exchanges\n\nCountries like Japan recognized Bitcoin as legal tender\n\nThese developments likely prevented further drops. By mid-2019, Bitcoin recovered to the $10k-$11k range.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis in 2020 proved Bitcoin\u2019s value as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Stimulus spending eroded fiat savings while Bitcoin held its value.\n\nGrowing institutional interest like Microstrategy\u2019s $500M Bitcoin purchase helped take prices past 2017 highs, eventually reaching an all-time high of around $68,000 in 2021.\n\n2021-2022 \u2013 Twin Peaks and Recession Risk\n\nBitcoin price made not one, but two new highs in 2021. The second high failed to move significantly past the first high, catching investors off-guard who had anticipated BTC reaching $100,000 or more.\n\nInstead, Bitcoin crashed throughout 2022 as the US Federal Reserve launched its QT program and began raising interest rates to fight back against inflation. The situation was worsened by the implosion of several crypto businesses, including FTX. Eventually, Bitcoin reached a local low of $15,800 in November 2022.\n\nHow is Bitcoin Doing Now in 2023?\n\nBitcoin price is doing its best to recovery from the crypto market carnage of 2022. The US Federal Reserve continues to raise rates to record levels, and the US SEC is cracking down on the rest of the crypto industry, making it harder for Bitcoin to regain its footing.\n\nDespite the challenges, many institutions are eying launching Bitcoin EFTs, which could create a bullish narrative that drives prices higher. In the meantime, BTC is correcting after spending the majority of 2023 in a short-term uptrend. The question remains: Is Bitcoin falling back into a bear market, or will the short-term uptrend roll into a more meaningful mid-term uptrend?\n\nShort-Term Bitcoin Price Prediction for 2023\n\nIn the short-term, as in before the end of 2023, there are primarily three options from a technical standpoint. The bullish scenario is based on Elliott Wave Principle, and points to a wave 5 and a possible new all-time high this year. The bearish scenario would put Bitcoin in a further corrective pattern, targeting $6,000 per BTC.\n\nOf course, an alternative scenario is that Bitcoin simple remains in a sideways consolidation phase for several months longer to finish out 2023. Otherwise, a Bitcoin price prediction of $160,000 in 2023 isn\u2019t impossible given past price trajectories and percentage moved.\n\nMedium-Term Bitcoin Price Prediction for 2024 & 2025\n\n\n\nIn the medium-term, Bitcoin price forecasts are based on the four-year cycle theory that relies on the Bitcoin block reward halving to tip the tides of supply and demand in favor of price appreciation. Fundamentally over the next several years, Bitcoin should have limited downside.\n\nInstead, Bitcoin price predictions for 2024 and 2025 point to anywhere between $100,000 to $250,000 per coin on the upside.\n\nLong-term Bitcoin Price Prediction for 2030 and Beyond\n\nPredicting Bitcoin\u2019s price in the long-term is challenging considering how new it still is. However, using a logarithmic growth curve, Bitcoin price predictions reach between $150,000 and $1 million per coin by 2030.\n\nFurther out into the future, if Bitcoin establishes itself as the leading global digital currency, it could be worth between $1 million and $10 million per coin.\n\nTotal 21 million BTC in supply would give Bitcoin a market cap of $21-$210 trillion, rivaling major assets like real estate and global broad money supply. But such valuations remain speculative. Bitcoin may also face future competition from both other cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\nBitcoin Price Predictions by Experts\n\nHere are some Bitcoin price forecasts by noteworthy experts and analysts.\n\nArk Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes that Bitcoin could hit over $1,000,000 per coin in the long term, with a \u201cbase case\u201d of $600,000.\n\nVenture capitalist Tim Draper sees Bitcoin price ultimately at more than $250,000 per BTC by the end of 2025. Standard Chartered has a Bitcoin price prediction of $120,000 by the end of 2024.\n\n\n\nFAQ: Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHere are answers to some common questions about this Bitcoin price prediction article:\n\nWhat was Bitcoin\u2019s lowest price?\n\nThe first recorded Bitcoin transaction in 2010 valued BTC at $0.0008. Bitcoin\u2019s lowest recent price was around $15,800 in late 2022.\n\nWhat was Bitcoin\u2019s highest price?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s all-time high price was around $68,000 in November 2021.\n\nHow high could Bitcoin realistically go?\n\nConsidering growing mainstream adoption and investment interest, Bitcoin realistically could reach $100,000-$500,000 by 2030. A $1 million+ valuation cannot be ruled out in the very long-term.\n\nCan Bitcoin price fall to zero?\n\nIt is unlikely Bitcoin price will crash to zero given its growing adoption, finite supply, and increasing regulation. There will likely always be some demand for Bitcoin which gives it fundamental value. Anything is possible, however.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin price so volatile?\n\nAs a new asset class, Bitcoin is still establishing itself, leading to volatility. Manipulation by \u201cwhales\u201d, media hype, and regulatory uncertainty add to large price swings. Price should stabilize with broader adoption.\n\nWhen will Bitcoin price stop fluctuating so much?\n\nBitcoin price volatility should reduce significantly as it becomes a mainstream asset and gains broader public adoption in 5-10 years. But some short-term fluctuations will always remain.\n\nWill Bitcoin price rise in 2023?\n\nConsidering adoption trends and investor interest, the overall Bitcoin price trajectory appears to be upwards in 2023 despite some short-term fluctuations.\n\nInvestment Disclaimer: The content provided in this article is for informational and educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nStroom Network, a liquid staking project for Bitcoin's Lightning Network, has raised $3.5 million in an oversubscribed seed funding round led by Berlin-based crypto investment firm Greenfield, with strategic support from Mission Street, the venture arm of Ankr.\n\nThe funding round was also joined by Lemniscap, No Limit Holdings, and Cogitent Ventures, along with several other venture capital firms and angel investors.\n\nBy applying the mechanics of liquid staking\u2014the process of staking tokens to a network and receiving a different token representing that staked position in return\u2014Stroom Network offers users the ability to trustlessly use their Bitcoin (BTC) capital simultaneously on both the Lightning Network (LN) and Ethereum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStroom, which currently has eight members, plans to use the raised funds to further expand the team and release the Liquid Staking Token on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe protocol effectively assigns BTC deposits within the Lightning Network to generate routing fees, while also generating its own equivalent of wrapped BTC (wBTC), called lnBTC, on a 1:1 basis.\n\nThis setup lets users pursue yield opportunities on Ethereum, similar to how they would when using wBTC.\n\n\u201cDespite having its limitations, Lightning Network is still the most promising payment technology out there,\u201d Slava Zhygulin, the CTO of Stroom, told Decrypt. \u201cIt doesn't have any competitors within the crypto space and could effectively compete with traditional payment rails.\"\n\nSolving Lightning\u2019s liquidity issues\n\nOne of the main challenges with Lightning is the lack of liquidity. For a transaction to occur, there has to be sufficient liquidity present in the payment channels, and limited liquidity can lead to delayed or failed transactions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Zhygulin, Stroom \u201cholds the key to solving this issue once and for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are confident that a well-managed liquidity allocation will drive adoption and result in higher yields,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cOur projections suggest a potential increase to a sustainable 6% APY in the near future.\"\n\nZhygulin further stated that Stroom\u2019s goal is to simplify the process of earning Lightning routing fees while also contributing to Bitcoin's scalability. This is achieved by streamlining the technical intricacies associated with managing a Lightning node and introducing mechanics from the decentralized finance (DeFi) realm.\n\nAccording to him, these mechanics have the potential to encourage Bitcoin users familiar with Ethereum to provide liquidity to the Lightning Network while still maintaining their yield on the Ethereum platform.\n\nStroom is also turning to a DAO-like structure using a multi-party signature computation mechanism to govern funds allocated to payment channels as liquidity.\n\nThis structure, according to Stroom, will be capable of establishing and modifying user incentives, upgrading the protocol, forming and using a treasury, as well as participating in decision-making processes related to spending collected fees."
