        "title": "Bitcoin is up 72% in 2023. Is Crypto Winter finally over? - Fortune",
        "content": "A regulatory crackdown, a banking collapse, and persistent inflation seemingly would spell trouble for the health of the crypto industry, but Bitcoin, Ether, and other marquee tokens have skyrocketed since the beginning of 2023.\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is up 72%, recently crossing the $30,000 threshold. (It has since dipped below $28,500, as inflation and rising interest rates have spooked investors.) Ether, the second largest, is up 62%, blowing past $2,000 after a successful upgrade to Ethereum, the token\u2019s blockchain. And the total market cap for all cryptocurrencies is up to about $1.2 trillion, an increase of approximately 50% since the beginning of the year, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nWhile recent prices for the most prominent digital assets still pale in comparison to their heights in 2021, when the total crypto market cap neared $3 trillion, the price rally has observers questioning whether Crypto Spring has finally sprung.\n\nIs crypto winter over or should I still hang my warm clothes at the door? \ud83d\udcc8 \u2014 Sariraa.eth (@SariraMerikhi) April 14, 2023\n\nBut is Crypto Winter actually over? Fortune spoke to four analysts to place the current rally in historical context.\n\nThe four-year cycle hypothesis\n\n\u201cCrypto has worked like clockwork in four-year cycles,\u201d Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, a crypto investment outfit, told Fortune.\n\nAnd so far, he says, there have been three rounds of peaks and valleys.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2013, the price of the cryptocurrency rose and then fell in 2014 with the collapse of one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, which went bankrupt after hackers made off with hundreds of millions in customer funds.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, crypto prices increased again, plummeting in 2018 when the era of ICOs, or initial coin offerings, left many investors bereft as many of the tokens they feverishly bought turned out to be quick cash grabs.\n\nAnd from 2019 to 2021, prices rose once more, dropping in 2022 after a series of high-profile crypto companies went belly-up, most significantly FTX, the bankrupt exchange once valued at $32 billion.\n\nSome analysts have commonly understood Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations\u2014and the crypto industry\u2019s growth writ large\u2014to roughly correspond to when Bitcoin is \u201chalved,\u201d or when the rewards for mining Bitcoin, the process by which computers secure the digital asset\u2019s blockchain, are reduced by 50%.\n\nThis reduction in Bitcoin rewards, the theory goes, makes the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply scarcer, which thereby increases its price.\n\n\u201cPost-halving, there\u2019s a big rally that happens,\u201d Gautam Chhugani, managing director and senior digital assets analyst at AB Bernstein, told Fortune. \u201cPre-halving, there\u2019s an anticipation rally that happens.\u201d\n\nBitwise\u2019s Hougan, on the other hand, believes that the start of each four-year cycle corresponds to technical innovations. In 2011, mass-market crypto exchanges\u2014Coinbase, Kraken, etc.\u2014launched, allowing laypeople to buy Bitcoin with cash. In 2015, Vitalik Buterin invented Ethereum, which promised to decentralize cloud computing. And in 2019, the \u201cfirst real applications of Ethereum\u201d appeared, Hougan says, including DeFi, or decentralized finance, stablecoins, and NFTs, or non-fungible tokens.\n\nThe four-year cycle hypothesis uses a sample size of three instances of price gains and falls, a small dataset. However, if the trend holds, crypto is due for another bull run.\n\nBullish on Bitcoin\u2014and crypto\n\nIn the near term, Chhugani of AB Bernstein believes Bitcoin and the crypto industry will follow the peaks and valleys of the larger world economy. However, he\u2019s optimistic on its medium and long-term outlook. \u201cBitcoin has never had two negative years consequently,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nAnalysts at Bitfinex Alpha, a market research team within the crypto exchange Bitfinex, agree. \u201cWhile the jury is still out as to whether the Crypto Winter is finally over, Bitcoin network activity is indicating a healthy uptrend in transaction fees,\u201d they said in a statement to Fortune.\n\nAnd Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, thinks it\u2019s arguable that the industry is even in a bear market at all. \u201cIt depends on what your definition of Crypto Winter is,\u201d he said.\n\nGoing by price and sentiment, or how the public views crypto, the chill of winter is obvious. However, going by other metrics, it\u2019s comparatively balmy.\n\nRudick cited a 40% increase in crypto users in 2022, according to Crypto.com, a 5% increase in the number of developers in 2022, according to Electric Capital, and a 293% increase in smart contracts deployed on Ethereum, or programs running on the blockchain, according to Alchemy.\n\nDespite the optimism, Chhugani, the analyst at AB Bernstein, warned that the feverish pace that saw Bitcoin\u2019s price rise to almost $70,000 in 2021 isn\u2019t directly around the corner. \u201cRegulation remains challenging,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cSo we\u2019re not in the middle of a crazy raging bull market.\u201d\n\nThat said, he remains bullish. \u201c\u200bThis industry has died like a few hundred times in the last 14 years,\u201d he said. However, despite constant predictions of crypto\u2019s collapse, he added, \u201cit doesn\u2019t really happen.\u201d"

        "title": "Newton grandmother scammed out of $20,000, used Bitcoin ATMs to send money - CBS Boston",
        "content": "NEWTON - It's a phone call that a Newton grandmother would give anything to go back and not answer. It happened last week; the caller said he was a federal law enforcement official, and he feared she was the victim of identity theft.\n\n\"He said, 'Alright, are you ready to go to the bank?' I said yes,\" the woman who did not want to be identified said. \"He spelled his name for me and he actually had me put his phone number into Google. It took me directly to the US Marshals Service website.\"\n\nElsewhere on the actual US Marshals Service website, there is a warning for this exact scam.\n\nDistracted on the phone call, the Newton victim didn't go digging. And unlike other popular schemes, there was no urgency, and no threatening tone. The caller calmly offered options for moving her money temporarily until a new Social Security number could be issued.\n\nShe told WBZ she began to let her guard down, as the man pretended to help her. \"Then you're going to go and use that money to buy Bitcoin. It'll go into a wallet that is strictly yours. Your name is on it; it's your money,\" she recalled him advising her, so that her savings wouldn't be inaccessible in a frozen account.\n\nOver the next 24 hours, the woman visited four local Citizens Bank branches and withdrew $30,000 in cash. She said no one ever questioned her.\n\n\"The teller said, 'We don't carry that kind of money. The best we can do is give you $9000 and small bills. He called over and found out the branch in Needham could give me $10,000,\" the woman recalled.\n\nShe spent hours on the phone with the man, as she drove to banks in Newton Centre, Needham, Chestnut Hill, and Newtonville. She used Bitcoin ATMs in Waltham and Newton, and after sending the first $20,000 she drove to her attorney's office. \"I wasn't two sentences into the story when he said that's a scam,\" she recalled.\n\nCitizens Bank wrote in a statement: \"We are sorry to hear that one of our customers may have been the victim of a scam...we do work closely with law enforcement when incidents occur and provide training for our colleagues in order to help detect such incidents.\"\n\nBack in February WBZ reported on a thwarted scheme in Norwood; an alert teller at Rockland Trust called police, concerned for a senior customer trying to take out $9000. That victim kept their money, but personal finance experts say it's a slippery slope.\n\n\"Do we really want bank tellers screening us and asking, how much money? What are you going to use this money for? Is this a legitimate purpose? I think we're invading privacy at this point,\" said Professor Jay Zagorsky of Boston University's Questrom School of Business.\n\nNewton Police are investigating, but this victim's $20,000 is long gone.\n\n\"I'm just pulling myself together now. It was just a terrible ordeal. This can happen to you. It doesn't matter how smart you are. It doesn't matter how skeptical you are. You can be had. They're very good at what they do,\" the victim said."

Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine?\n\nClean electricity, the backbone of the Biden administration\u2019s strategy for slashing carbon emissions, is becoming daunting to expand.\n\nUS wind farms, which last year generated more electricity than all hydropower and solar panels in the 50 states combined, often face years of contention. The entire mid-Atlantic offshore region, an area brimming with wind potential, could be proscribed by Pentagon fretting over interferences with aircraft deployment, Bloomberg News disclosed this week.\n\nBut if red tape for green power is a bother, why not get the benefits with none of the fuss? Send commando teams to the 34 large-scale Bitcoin mining sites in the United States that were identified in a New York Times front-page expos\u00e9 this month. In synchrony, have them sever the facilities\u2019 power cables, which combined demand some 3,900 megawatts of electricity\u2014nearly as much as 3 million households combined.\n\nIn a flash, legions of electricity-gulping, combination-seeking computers in Texas, New York, and 13 other states would cease whirring. Like a power surge but in reverse, the fossil-fuel generators energizing so-called cryptocurrency mining\u2014literally, trillions of combination-seeking calculations every second\u2014would dial down. The corresponding drop in carbon emissions would be the same as if thousands of new industrial-size wind turbines could be instantly erected and connected to grids, supplanting electricity now furnished by burning coal and methane gas. More From Charles Komanoff The Manchin-Schumer Deal Could Pay Off\u2014if Congress Acts August 2, 2022 The Climate Movement in Its Own Way May 2, 2022 The Case Against Closing Nuclear Power Plants April 4, 2022\n\nFanciful? Consider the numbers. The Times helpfully enumerated each Bitcoin mine\u2019s fossil-fueled draw on state and regional power grids along with the associated carbon emissions. It took only a few further steps for me to translate those emissions into generic megawatts of clean power that would defray them. Using today\u2019s customary 300-foot-tall, 3.6-megawatt wind machines as my standard, I calculated a staggering 3,700 turbines.\n\nThere you have it: The US Bitcoin industry is single-handedly neutering the entire climate benefit from nearly 10 percent of US wind energy. That\u2019s more electricity than is generated with wind in any single state, save Texas and Iowa.\n\nThis raises two uncomfortable questions for the climate movement: Why isn\u2019t it rallying against Bitcoin mines and other parasitic users of carbon fuels? And why isn\u2019t it taking the obvious step of calling for a tax on carbon emissions to reduce those usages while simultaneously extracting revenues from them?

Who Is In Charge in the Biden White House? Books & the Arts / Osita Nwanevu Current Issue View our current issue\n\nSecond question first. Generating the electricity consumed by those 34 Bitcoin mines causes 16.4 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year, according to the Times. If the United States had a $100 per ton carbon tax\u2014the current price of carbon emission permits in the European Union\u2019s cap-and-trade system\u2014the carbon levies at the mine mouth and wellhead would be extracting $1.5 billion a year from the fossil fuel companies that power the Bitcoin operations, and depositing it into the Treasury.\n\nTo be sure, that money would only fund a mere 2.4 hours of federal spending a year\u2014barely a single baseball game\u2019s worth, under the new hurry-up-and-pitch rules. On the other hand, the tax moneys are twice what Fox News will pay Dominion Voting Systems under the settlement reached this week. And they\u2019re recurring.\n\nHad the tax been in place a decade ago, as I and others urged, the extra expense might have stopped some cyber-currency ventures from the git-go. But if it were put into place today, a robust carbon tax could at least impel Bitcoin miners to economize on electricity, charge more for transactions, or actually contract with greener power providers rather than merely pretending to, as the Times found.\n\nAlthough no one can pinpoint precisely how a carbon tax would shrink Bitcoin mining\u2019s carbon footprint, let alone any single sector\u2019s, abundant empirical evidence suggests that total US carbon emissions would be around a third less with a triple-digit national carbon tax than without. Bitcoin would not be exempt.\n\nBut it would not be extinguished. That\u2019s where the climate movement comes in.\n\nThe movement has targeted banks and pipelines for more than a decade, with not much to show in the way of lesser carbon emissions. Why isn\u2019t it disrupting Bitcoin mining and other bloodsucking machines\u2014helicopters, private jets, yachts, super-sized SUVs\u2014that feed on fossil fuels and are predominantly playthings of plutocrats? Why isn\u2019t it going all out to stop highway expansions and eliminate restrictive zoning that lock in energy waste for generations?\n\nPut simply, the climate movement is playing the wrong game.\n\nYes, climate activists stopped Keystone XL. They won a ban on fracking in New York. They\u2019re fighting to drive oil drilling out of Los Angeles. Valiant, heroic work. But these and other keep-it-in-the-ground victories are creating little climate benefit. Why? Because the same underlying demand, largely unaffected by those protests, is met by supplies from elsewhere.\n\nThe bank protests seem even less focused. Conoco doesn\u2019t need financing from JPMorgan Chase or Wells Fargo to drill in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. The only \u201cbank\u201d it requires is the collective fuel tanks of America\u2019s 280 million motor vehicles, plus aircraft, off-road vehicles, and pleasure boats.\n\nMarching on Citibank does send a message, and activating seniors who might otherwise sit at home posting about their grandkids is soul-stirring. But if divestment and bank-shaming were going to slow the assault on climate, we would have seen bigger results by now.\n\n\u201cIf the world wants to limit warming,\u201d Norwegian energy researcher Espen Erlingsen told the Times this month, \u201cit will have to limit demand for oil and gas because [the] industry can deliver this kind of volume for many more decades.\u201d\n\nAmen. The climate movement\u2019s strategy isn\u2019t working. Trying to bottle up supply instead of throttling demand is whack-a-mole without end, chasing after but never stopping capitalism\u2019s dynamism from erupting in crypto mining and 1,001 other climate-destroying products and technologies.\n\nBy itself, a carbon tax won\u2019t cure that. But it would at least start to steer innovation and cultural norms away from endless new climate horrors.\n\nAs Philip Roth\u2019s Mickey Sabbath might have said: Either tax carbon or bring on the commandos."

Users can exchange it among themselves without the involvement of traditional intermediaries such as banks and governments.\n\nUnchained has said its bitcoin native ecosystem ensures that users can secure and maximize the value of their bitcoin holdings over multiple generations. The firm currently secures more than $2 billion in bitcoin across thousands of keys, according to the company.\n\nUnchained also offers bitcoin-collateralized loans and said it has originated $500 million of such loans since 2017. Other services include a trading desk, where clients can directly buy bitcoin.\n\nThe Series B funding round was led by Chicago-based Valor Equity Partners, with participation from existing investors NYDIG, Trammell Venture Partners, Ecliptic Capital, and Highland Capital Partners. Unchained has raised a total of $115 million since its launch.\n\nThe new cash infusion will be used to add more clients and expand product development and marketing.\n\nUnchained, which is headquartered in downtown Austin in the Littlefield Building at 601 Congress Ave., has 85 employees and plans to increase its head count 5% per quarter through the end of the year, a company spokesperson said.\n\nHow is the bitcoin market performing?\n\nThe bitcoin market has been a roller coaster ride. Just months ago, all forms of cryptocurrency appeared to be going down in flames, with bitcoin plunging from almost $50,000 at the start of 2022 to less than $17,000 in early 2023.\n\nUnchained wasn\u2019t immune and cut its workforce by 15%, or 16 employees, in mid-November, according to bitcoin trade publications.\n\nBy March, bitcoin had soared more than 60%, but its course forward remains uncertain. Bitcoin slid toward $29,000 Wednesday as traders mulled the likelihood that Federal Reserve rate cuts might be farther out than they thought.\n\nVivek Pattipati, a partner at Valor who will be joining Unchained\u2019s board of directors, acknowledged the challenges but said Unchained is positioned to be a market leader.\n\n\"In the midst of market chaos, Unchained has emerged as a highly trusted provider of bitcoin custody and financial services through superior technology, risk management, regulatory compliance, and client service,\u201d he said. \u201cParticularly in lending, the company has differentiated itself by minimizing risk to both the lender and the borrower, leading to resilience and an extraordinary opportunity to capture market share.\"\n\nMore:Austin's job market is confusing. Here's what to know.\n\nWhat's ahead for Austin venture capital and the job market?\n\nVenture capital investment matters to the Central Texas economy because it allows businesses \u2014 both startups and later-stage companies \u2014 to create jobs.\n\nBut with economic uncertainty looming, the level of investment dollars flowing into Austin in 2023 remains to be seen. Last year, despite an overall slowdown in U.S. venture capital funding, Austin startups fared well, scoring the second-highest amount in local history.\n\nAustin-based early stage companies raised $5 billion in funding in 2022, which is down slightly from the record-setting $5.4 billion that startups received in 2021, according to a report by the Austin Chamber of Commerce and Opportunity Austin.\n\nMore:Will dollars keep pouring in for Austin startups in 2023? Here's what experts say\n\nOther Austin deals this year include a $24 million investment in Strangeworks, which designs quantum software tools for software developers, system managers, researchers, technical staffers and chief information officers.\n\nMeanwhile, tech giants with large Austin presences \u2014 including Google, Facebook parent company Meta, Austin-based Tesla and Round Rock-based Dell Technologies \u2014 have all laid off thousands of employees since late last year.\n\nMeta recently announced another major round of layoffs. The company has cut at least 220 Austin jobs, according to a WARN letter \u2014 short for Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.\n\nFacebook said late last year that it would not use an office space it had long anticipated expanding into in downtown Austin. Facebook had signed a lease to occupy all 589,000 square feet of office space in the mixed-use tower called Sixth and Guadalupe, but it now is subleasing the space.\n\nLast month, Austin-based job site Indeed.com said it will lay off 2,200 employees, or roughly 15% of its global team, citing a cooldown in the overall job market and demand for its technology.\n\nMore:See which companies announced layoffs and closings\n\nThe company, which is one of Austin's biggest technology employers, announced the cuts in a blog post of an email sent to employees by Indeed CEO Chris Hyams on Wednesday. Hyams said the cuts come across the company, from nearly every team, function, level and region. He said Indeed also will institute other cost-saving measures.\n\nAdditional material from The Associated Press."

        "title": "One Metric That Shows Bitcoin Is Becoming a Store of Value - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It might come as a surprise, but Bitcoin (BTC -0.68%) could finally be fulfilling its potential as a store of value. Since its creation, many have struggled to categorize exactly what Bitcoin is and what purpose it serves. The digital currency has been viewed by some as a viable method of payment, a hedge against inflation, an alternative to fiat currencies, and even digital gold.\n\nWhile it might actually be an amalgam of all these, now more so than ever, it looks like Bitcoin is acting like a traditional safe-haven asset.\n\nAlthough gold is touted as the premier safe haven asset in the face of economic uncertainty, the prices of Bitcoin and gold are actually at some of their highest levels of correlation today and could be a sign that the narrative around Bitcoin might be changing.\n\nThe current landscape\n\nAlthough Bitcoin's main purpose remains slightly ambiguous, it has performed surprisingly well in the last month as turmoil swept through the banking industry in the U.S. and Europe. Since banks such as Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse (CS) toppled in early March, Bitcoin is up more than 25%.\n\nIn similar fashion, when news broke of the banking failures the price of gold skyrocketed as well. Gold has risen nearly 10% since March, and is at an all-time high of more than $2,000 an ounce.\n\nYet, while Bitcoin's price isn't near the all-time highs that gold is, both have traded in a surprisingly similar fashion. Today, the correlation coefficient between the two is about 0.94. Consider that the scale ranges from 1 (perfect correlation and moving in lockstep) to -1 (negative correlation and moving in opposition). There has only been one other time in history that the two have traded at such high levels, and that was back in 2020.\n\nWith Bitcoin having long been criticized for its volatility and lack of intrinsic value, this high level of correlation is a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency. During much of the past year, it moved more in line with the stock market, and specifically tech stocks. But now that seems to be changing.\n\nIt might be a stretch, but perhaps this could mark the beginning of Bitcoin's legitimization as a viable safe haven in the face of economic turbulence.\n\nWhy Bitcoin\n\nOne of the key reasons Bitcoin is proving to be a legitimate store of value is its scarcity. Unlike traditional currencies, which can be printed at will by central banks, the supply of bitcoins is strictly limited. There will only ever be 21 million tokens in circulation, which means that its value is unlikely to be eroded by inflation in the same way that fiat currencies can.\n\nFurthermore, its decentralized nature means that it is not subject to the same kind of political or economic pressures that can affect traditional currencies. Although central banks can be subject to political pressures, Bitcoin operates outside of this system entirely. This gives it an independence and security that traditional currencies simply cannot match.\n\nMore people will likely come to this realization, although it might only come if additional economic pressures cause other institutions to fall. Should this be the case, it would provide a compelling argument to have some exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nWith its price still well off its all-time high, buying today seems as alluring. Simply put, Bitcoin's potentially lucrative future seems to outweigh the risk that is often associated with cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Australia-based information services platform Finder said it ran a survey in April of 32 crypto industry specialists for views on the price outlook for Bitcoin in the coming decade. According to the average predictions for 2023, Bitcoin will hit a high of US$42,225, a low of US$17,026, and close the year at US$35,485.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin reclaims US$30,000, Ether heads higher after SEC\u2019s Gensler grilling; Polkadot leads winners\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price will be closely related to developments in the banking industry, according to Ben Ritchie, director of Digital Capital Management AU. \u201cA shakeout in the banking industry could demonstrate Bitcoin\u2019s ability to store value, offering an alternative investment option free from government and central bank controls,\u201d he said. But the downside is dwindling liquidity and regulations that choke off access to banks for the crypto sector, he added.\n\nThe lack of confidence in the traditional banking system is seen as the biggest factor behind Bitcoin\u2019s surge in March, which witnessed the collapses of three U.S. banks and the takeover of Switzerland\u2019s Credit Suisse, according to the survey.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has proven to be negatively correlated with the failure of traditional financial institutions. While the banks have collapsed, Bitcoin adoption is increasing amongst institutions and retail investors,\u201d said Rishabh Gupta, director of crypto incubator and consulting company TDeFi, who predicted Bitcoin to reach US$75,000 in 2023.\n\n\u201cPension funds have started allocating 2-3% capital to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Post 2024 halving, Bitcoin supply will become more scarce leaving a positive impact on the price,\u201d Gupta said.\n\nMost of the survey\u2019s respondents are bullish about the current trend in Bitcoin, with 52% saying now is a good time to buy, 32% saying good time to hold, and 16% seeing a sell opportunity.\n\nHowever, 72% of those questioned said the collapse of crypto-friendly banks in the U.S. can hinder cryptocurrency adoption as U.S. digital asset firms struggle to find bank partners.\n\nFinder\u2019s survey predicts Bitcoin\u2019s price will reach US$99,781 by 2025 and US$297,848 by 2030, which are 29% and 58% higher than the survey in January 2023.\n\n\u201cBTC will get quite significant capital inflows from institutional investors following the decrease in interest rates. At the same time, [the market] capitalization of BTC is still very small [and] new money will easily push the price up.\u201d said Ilya Volkov, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange and lender YouHodler.\n\nRecent slowing economic indicators in the U.S. have added to optimism the Federal Reserve could soon end its year-long cycle of raising interest rates to curb inflation. Analysts at CME group expect an 84.6% chance of a 25-basis-point increase in interest rates in May, followed by a rate cut by the end of 2023.\n\nHowever, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said on Tuesday it was still too early to consider rate cuts given the stubbornly high inflation rate, according to CNBC on Tuesday. The inflation rate stands at around 5%, compared to the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\n\nSee related article: United Arab Emirates opens licensing applications for cryptocurrency companies"

That helped drive bitcoin higher by 8% to above the $30,000 mark.\n\nThe price of bitcoin was last lower by 3.22% and trading at $29,227.24, while ether fell 4.82% to $1,980.68, according to Coin Metrics.\n\nBitcoin slid toward $29,000 on Wednesday as traders mulled over the likelihood that Federal Reserve rate cuts may be further away than they thought.\n\nInvestors Wednesday morning were taking in new U.K. inflation data, which showed consumer prices unexpectedly held above 10% in March. That fueled expectations that the Bank of England could hike rates by 25 basis points at its May meeting.\n\nMeanwhile in the U.S., Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said Tuesday that he anticipates one more 25 basis point interest rate increase and then a hold \"for quite some time.\" Bostic spoke to CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"\n\n\"There have been some signs the Fed could be more aggressive towards higher interest rate policy than what the market is pricing, which has been driving yield differentials in the U.S. dollar's favor, while weighing on sentiment,\" Kruger said.\n\nMarket participants had expected a pullback in crypto prices this week as investors moved attention away from Ethereum's latest technical upgrade and toward the potential that the Fed could push the economy into a recession with its rate hikes \u2014 which would give bitcoin a new proving ground at a time when investors are just warming to the diversity of the crypto asset's potential.\n\nClara Medalie, head of research at crypto data provider Kaiko, noted that liquidity in the crypto market remains low after the U.S. lost two of its biggest fiat-to-crypto on-ramps in the banking crisis earlier this year \u2013 the networks provided by Silvergate and Signature Bank.\n\n\"Overall, volatility can be expected both towards the upside and downside due to a prolonged bout of thin liquidity in crypto markets, which has hit bitcoin and ether particularly hard,\" she said. \"It is hard to trust any crypto rally with the state of market liquidity, so a sharp drop towards the downside is hardly a surprise.\"\n\nTraders were also digesting Tuesday's contentious congressional hearing with Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who defended his agency's crackdown on cryptocurrency trading platforms and failed to provide a clear answer on whether ether is a security. Gensler has long maintained that all crypto assets other than bitcoin should be deemed securities."

Ether also fell to lose hold of the US$2,000 price support in a sell off across all top 10 non-stablecoin tokens. Some commentators ascribed the declines to a repricing based on recent concerns about inflation and higher interest rates ahead. Litecoin led the losers. U.S. equity futures dipped after Wall Street closed flat to lower on Wednesday.\n\nSee related article: US chip giant Intel abandons Bitcoin ASIC production\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin fell 4.59% to US$28,943 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly loss of 3.59%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency lost about US$1,000 in an hour starting from 4:00 p.m. Hong Kong on Wednesday.\n\nEther slumped 7.20% to US$1,947, but remains 1.93% higher for the past seven days. The token traded below the US$2,000 mark for the first time since April 13, when the Ethereum blockchain completed its Shanghai upgrade.\n\nLitecoin led the losers with a drop of 10.50% in the past 24 hours and traded at US$90.85, falling 1.39% for the week.\n\nThe latest selloff in cryptocurrencies is an overdue correction following the rally this year and investors taking profits as a risk-off trend emerged in global markets, according to a CNBC report on Wednesday citing Joel Kruger, market strategist at forex and crypto platform Lmax Group.\n\nThe risk-off mood follows more global inflation signals. The U.K. on Wednesday reported a 10.1% annual increase in the consumer price index for March, beating projections for a 9.8% gain. Also this week, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said it\u2019s too early to consider an interest rate cut, given the stubborn U.S. inflation rate, which stood at 5% in March, compared to the Fed\u2019s goal of 2%.\n\nLmax Group tweeted on Thursday the crypto market \u201chas been forced to have a serious rethink about how it has been pricing\u201d with respect to monetary policies.\n\nAnother down arrow is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s testimony before Congress on Tuesday, where he said much of the business model of the cryptocurrency sector has been built around non-compliance with securities regulations.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 5.04% in the past 24 hours to US$1.21 trillion. The total trading volume over the last 24 hours rose 33.08% to US$62.36 billion.\n\nIn the NFT market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.23% to 4,012.98 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but remained 0.74% higher for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.11%. The S&P 500 futures fell 0.24%. The Nasdaq Composite Index moved down 0.35%.\n\nThe three U.S. equity indexes stalled on Wednesday on softer first-quarter earning reports, while the Federal Reserve\u2019s Beige Book survey on economic conditions published on Wednesday shows a sharp fall in lending after the failure of a trio of regional banks last month.\n\nNegatives for crypto from the bank failures include \u201cdwindling liquidity driven by strong risk-off sentiments and regulatory pressures impacting banking access for the sector,\u201d Ben Ritchie, director of Digital Capital Management AU said in a report by information services platform Finder.\n\nU.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006. Analysts at the CME Group now see a 16.7% chance the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged at its next meeting on May 3, while 83.3% predict a 25-basis-point increase, down from 84.8% on Wednesday.\n\n(Updates to correct Bitcoin price decline in second sentence of first bullet.)\n\nSee related article: Trump\u2019s Series 2 sells out, tops daily NFT sales chart"

        "content": "Bitcoin Stamps seek to offer greater permanence and security on the blockchain, attracting collectors and creators.\n\nBitcoin Stamps are the latest innovation in the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), offering collectors and creators a secure and reliable means of storing unique digital assets on bitcoin, like Ordinals. According to creator Mike In Space, stamps guarantee greater permanence than other protocols as they are stored directly in the spendable transaction outputs of the blockchain, making them impossible to prune.\n\nIn just 32 days since the launch of the first Stamp, 16,500 Stamps had been created on the Bitcoin blockchain, outpacing the daily growth of assets created compared to Ordinals.\n\nThe Rare Stamp platform, launched on April 6, 2023, indexes all Stamp data such as prices, last sales and other relevant data. The platform has witnessed the growing interest in Bitcoin NFTs and the rapid expansion of Stamps, receiving over 20,000 visits from users interested in discovering, buying and selling Stamps according to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n\n\n\"We are excited to bring visibility to this innovation that allows for the creation of virtually eternal NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. The rapid adoption of Stamps shows the growing interest in NFTs and the demand for more permanent and secure solutions,\" said Angel Haro, CMO of Universelle, the Spanish consulting firm that developed the Rare Stamp platform.\n\nBitcoin Stamps seeks to offer a secure and reliable means of storing unique digital assets on the blockchain, according to the press release. With the growing interest in Bitcoin-based digital assets and the demand for more permanent and secure solutions, the Rare Stamp platform aims to provide detailed information on sale prices, new collections and other unique features.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin is already on a torrid pace through the first three and a half months of 2023, but some crypto market observers believe that the largest digital currency is poised to rocket higher over the next several weeks. Should that move materialize, it could facilitate upside for crypto-correlated, equity-based exchange traded funds such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) .\n\nHome to 36 stocks as well as a 13.27% stake in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), SATO makes for an ideal avenue for participating in possible bitcoin upside without having to directly own the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn an interview with Barron\u2019s, Vetle Lund, an analyst at crypto research group K33, highlighted bitcoin\u2019s near-term technical picture, which indicates that sizable gains could be afoot over the next month.\n\n\u201cWhile no one should expect a one-to-one mirroring of the current drawdown to previous drawdowns, the resemblance to the 2018 drawdown is staggering,\u201d Lund said. \u201cIf history repeats, Bitcoin will peak around May 20 at $45,000.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was trading around $30,340 late Tuesday, indicating that a move to $45,000 over a month would undoubtedly be impressive. The last time bitcoin traded around that level was in early 2022, but that was as it was selling off from its November 2021 level as the crypto winter of 2022 set in.\n\nA nearly 50% move in a matter of weeks, even for bitcoin, is a tough road for any asset. However, it\u2019s not completely out of the realm of possibility for bitcoin because there are potential catalysts looming, including the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 3.\n\n\u201cThe rally across cryptos this year has largely come amid expectations that the Fed will soon become more accommodative on monetary policy\u2014a narrative that will continue to shift ahead of the central bank\u2019s next decision on May 3,\u201d according to Barron\u2019s.\n\nAs for SATO, the Invesco ETF\u2019s leverage to bitcoin price action beyond GBTC is clear. Many of the ETF\u2019s other holdings are crypto miners \u2014 an asset class highly tethered to goings-on in spot crypto prices. SATO\u2019s sensitivity to bitcoin prices has been on full display in recent weeks, as the ETF is higher by 30% over the past 90 days. Roughly 84% of the fund\u2019s equity holdings reside in mid- and small-cap territory.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel .\n\nThe opinions and forecasts expressed herein are solely those of Tom Lydon, and may not actually come to pass.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nCrypto derivatives exchange Deribit is launching free trading of bitcoin and other tokens, setting up a fresh price war among digital asset exchanges as they seek to re-emerge after a bruising year for the industry.\n\nThe Panama-based group, the world\u2019s biggest crypto options exchange, will begin direct trading in three of the most popular cryptocurrency pairs from next week and waive the fees.\n\nIts move underscores how competition is heating up among crypto exchanges as they try to entice institutional investors keen to get into a rising market after the crash in digital asset prices last year and the failure of industry bellwether FTX. Around 90 per cent of Deribit\u2019s customers are institutional clients.\n\nPopular coins such as bitcoin and ether have outperformed assets such as stocks and commodities this year, rising 50 per cent and 65 per cent respectively.\n\nIt also comes a month after Binance, the world\u2019s largest marketplace for crypto trading, ended a six-month foray into zero-fee trading, a move that accelerated its market share.\n\nLuuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, said the exchange\u2019s move into spot trading was driven by customer demand.\n\n\u201cYou would have to buy ether on Binance instead of Deribit,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIf you want to convert $5mn [into bitcoin], for example, we would have to tell you to go elsewhere, which is terrible customer service.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to have a proper derivatives offering you also need to have spot,\u201d he added.\n\nBig-name money managers have continued to explore digital assets and monetise investor interest in the past year, even as the industry suffered a confidence crisis and many companies failed.\n\n\u201cSerious institutional players remain committed and, in fact, see the open space after the demise of multiple crypto-native players as an opportunity.\u201d Bernstein analysts wrote this week.\n\nDeribit will offer free trading in pairs of ether and bitcoin, and ether and bitcoin against the stablecoin USDC, which is operated by Circle. US-listed Coinbase charges up to 0.6 per cent for a trade, for example.\n\nStrijers added that trading on the three pairs would remain free to trade \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d and that future tokens that might be added would have a charge.\n\nThe market share of Binance soared by a fifth after launching fee-free trading in 13 coins and at reached nearly two-thirds of total volume on the exchange, according to data provider Kaiko. However the exchange\u2019s lead fell back after it reintroduced charges.\n\nDeribit added that it was looking to use spot trading as an entry for customers to trade options and futures. Strijers said this would \u201cservice our existing client base and potentially attract some new clients who then . . . will also trade options, futures or perpetual [futures]\u201d.\n\nDeribit was founded in 2016 and is backed by investors including crypto venture firm 10T Holdings and trading firm Akuna Capital."

Won\u2019t that tank ETH\u2019s price? It didn\u2019t happen. In the initial moments after the upgrade went live, the cryptocurrency held steady just above $1,900. Hours later, ETH zoomed above $2,100 . What\u2019s more, there\u2019s evidence there was an inflow , not outflow, of money into ETH in the aftermath. This raises a question: Does the ability to stake and then unstake any time improve the case for investing in ETH? Is it more alluring to investors now the barrier to getting your money back is gone?"

        "content": "According to data provided by BTC.com, Bitcoin's mining difficulty has undergone an adjustment at block height 786,240, increasing by 1.72% to reach a record high of 48.71T.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis development coincided with the average hashrate of the entire Bitcoin network reaching a new peak of 348.6 EH/s in spite of the bear market.\n\nOver the last 12 months, Bitcoin's mining difficulty has experienced significant fluctuations, starting from 29.79T on April 27, 2022, and reaching the aforementioned record high on April 20. This represents a 63.54% increase in mining difficulty over the year.\n\nThe mining difficulty has spiked in the majority of the adjustments. Over the past year, there have been only five instances where it decreased.\n\nMining difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is for miners to find a valid hash for a block of transactions. It adjusts approximately every two weeks, or every 2,016 blocks, to maintain a stable block time of roughly 10 minutes.\n\nA higher mining difficulty makes it more challenging for miners to mine new blocks, which in turn makes the network more secure.\n\nThis increased security comes as a result of the computational power required to carry out a successful attack, which becomes increasingly difficult as mining difficulty rises.\n\nThe record high mining difficulty is a testament to the strength and resilience of the Bitcoin network, as it continues to attract more miners and investment."

        "content": "'Meltdown to zero': Kevin O'Leary says there's a 100% chance of another crypto debacle \u2014 and it will happen 'over and over' again. Here's what he likes instead\n\nBitcoin is on another wild ride.\n\nLate last year, the downfall of cryptocurrency exchange FTX sent investors running for the exits. But now, bitcoin is up 80% in 2023.\n\nDon't miss\n\nStill, Shark Tank star Kevin O\u2019Leary warns that there could be more fiascos in the crypto world.\n\nWhen asked whether he believed there would be another FTX during a Kitco News interview, O\u2019Leary\u2019s response was affirmative.\n\n\u201cIf you're asking me will there be another meltdown to zero? Absolutely, 100% it'll happen and it'll keep happening over and over and over again,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAll the unregulated exchanges are having massive outflows right now. The smart money has got the joke. They saw what happened in FTX. They're not sitting around for an explanation.\u201d\n\nSimply put, institutional investors won\u2019t put their money in unregulated crypto exchanges.\n\n\u201cIf you're not willing to be audited, and I'm speaking about any exchange, if you don't have an auditor, you don't want to be transparent, you don't want to disclose ownership, why should institutional capital stay there? Of course it's not going to.\u201d\n\nThat said, O\u2019Leary isn\u2019t bailing on bitcoin.\n\nKeeping it safe\n\nMr. Wonderful has been buying the dip.\n\n\u201cI have been going back into the crypto markets lately. Anytime bitcoin drops below $17,000, I add to our positions there.\u201d\n\nAnd where does O\u2019Leary keep his crypto investments these days?\n\nUp north.\n\n\u201cThe only place I have any crypto right now is up in the Canadian market, which is 100% regulated. They have a broker-dealer attached to an exchange regulated by the OSC [Ontario Securities Commission], all kinds of rules, you can't commingle,\u201d he tells Kitco News.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt's called Bitbuy and I've got my money there. It's owned by WonderFi, a public company. I\u2019ve got lots of capital tied up in there \u2014 it's the only place.\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, O\u2019Leary is not going to put his money in unregulated exchanges.\n\n\u201cForget it, never again.\u201d\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nGold\n\nSome say that bitcoin is the new gold. While O\u2019Leary has been one of the more outspoken proponents of bitcoin, he still likes the original yellow metal.\n\nO\u2019Leary tells Kitco News that to hedge against inflation, he has a 5% weighting in gold and a 5% weighting in bitcoin.\n\nIndeed, gold can\u2019t be printed out of thin air like fiat money. And its value tends to stay resilient even in times of crisis.\n\nThere are many ways to gain exposure to gold. O\u2019Leary uses two methods for his 5% exposure.\n\n\u201cI have half of that \u2014 two and a half percent \u2014 in physical gold that I pay for storage. And I use various ETFs for the rest so I can rebalance every quarter.\u201d\n\nSome gold investors also own shares of gold mining companies, but O\u2019Leary is not one of them.\n\n\u201cI don't own the miners because over a long period of time, 25 years, you want to get the idiot management out of the equation,\u201d he says. \u201cAll they're doing for you is mining it out of the ground. You might as well just own the commodity.\u201d\n\nStocks\n\nAt the end of the day, O\u2019Leary\u2019s portfolio doesn\u2019t consist mostly of gold or bitcoin. He\u2019s still an equity investor above all else.\n\n\u201cI've got a large allocation to equities,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd like most smart investors, O\u2019Leary is not putting all the eggs in one basket.\n\n\u201cNo equity more than 5%. No sector more than 20%. So it's very diversified.\u201d\n\nOf course, even a diversified portfolio can have its ups and downs. In 2022, the S&P 500 tumbled 19.4%. So what should investors look for in a company in today\u2019s market?\n\n\u201cNow I'm looking for companies that, A, are cash flow positive, B, do distributions of profits. So in other words, they take the cash and they distribute it through dividends. Some of them will do share buybacks, but not now that's being taxed, I think that the dividend is going to be more popular,\u201d he says.\n\nAt the same time, O\u2019Leary emphasizes that it\u2019s important for companies to do this \u201cwithout taking on debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if you have a clean balance sheet, not too much debt, and you're distributing profits, well, that's a good place to invest.\u201d\n\nWhat to read next\n\n60% of working Americans aren't confident about retiring one day. Put those nagging thoughts to rest \u2014 in as little as 3 minutes heading into a recession\n\nUBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset class\n\nThe average home insurance policy is nearly 40% higher than it was 12 years ago \u2014 here's how to spend less on peace of mind\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "content": "Yeah, so there's one thing I think is very important, and I'm surprised that this isn't the consensus view, which is that [artificial intelligence] is inevitable. The idea that every government, private company, every individual hacker in the world is going to sign and agree to, like, slow down AI research is jokingly nice. And it's very scary to me that people would rather hand over control of all this development to some sort of, you know, vague, global body that controls how we can develop and interact with AI systems \u2013 that would make decisions for the rest of humanity. Now this is out of the box, I don't think it's possible to stop, we can sort of predict the way things will go. Some trends are kind of obvious: There's going to be automation of a large swath of the current \u201cwhite-collar labor market.\u201d Consumer AI systems are really just better and more efficient versions of mental labor. But when it comes to longer-term trends, whether AI will destroy us \u2013 these things are fascinating. Through prompting AI you can actually get it to write software, explain to you how to download it and get it running on your machine \u2013 that\u2019s how it escapes the box, right? It\u2019ll become very tricky to discern, like, what is human and AI, or what was augmented. The weird effects here are emergent and hard to predict. When I think about it as an investor, and see algorithms that are trained on specific data, maybe the algorithm itself ends up being a commodity, which I think is something nobody exactly saw. You know, there's this sort of interface and application layer that actually ends up being the most valuable components themselves. I do think it's possible this is one of the singularity technologies where we create an AI to write code to create a better AI and it's like a recursive loop, which may lead to recursive loops with other novel technologies."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) may be struggling at $30,000, but under the hood, all-time highs of a different kind keep coming.\n\nThe latest data shows that Bitcoin network fundamentals \u2014 difficulty and hash rate \u2014 will hit new records this week.\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty, hash rate refuse to slow down\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 2023 recovery has been about more than just BTC price action, with miners seeing a significant turnaround of their own.\n\nAs BTC/USD added 70% in Q1 alone, pressured mining participants saw some much-needed relief after the bear market squeezed profit margins to practically zero.\n\nThe comeback for miners is evident in difficulty, which among other things, reflects competition for block subsidies.\n\nThis has made new all-time highs for the past two months, and this week will be no exception. According to data from BTC.com, the difficulty will increase by approximately 2.1% on April 20, reaching 48.91 trillion.\n\nThe dizzying tally is a full 13 trillion higher than at the start of the year alone.\n\nBitcoin network fundamentals overview (screenshot). Source: BTC.com\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin network hash rate is also estimated to be higher than ever, with raw data from MiningPoolStats etching a new all-time high of 418 exahashes per second (EH/s) on April 18.\n\nBitcoin hash rate raw data (screenshot). Source: MiningPoolStats\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, hash rate estimates are far from concrete and can be misleading, with calls now surfacing to reevaluate how it is measured and reported by those seeking to make bullish conclusions about BTC price strength.\n\nHowever, as the old adage goes, \u201cprice follows hash rate,\u201d and some commentators continue to watch the metric keenly as it drifts ever higher.\n\nA key focus is Russia, stepping up mining activity over the past year to reportedly become the world\u2019s second-largest miner in 2023, according to a report in Russian-language news outlet Kommersant.\n\nWhile this has led to concerns that governments with a majority hash rate share could pressure miners to censor transactions, others believe that the real \u201cdanger\u201d is using that hash rate for its intended purpose \u2014 earning Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cAdversaries hypothetically using hashrate to censor #btc transactions is a distraction from adversaries actually using hashrate to earn #btc revenue,\u201d Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, wrote in part of a recent commentary on the topic.\n\nBitcoin miners not yet hoarding BTC\n\nA look at the current state of miner balances meanwhile shows that on a rolling 30-day basis, BTC sales are increasing.\n\nRelated: What is Bitcoin hash rate and why does it matter?\n\nOn April 18, miners decreased their Bitcoin holdings by 648 BTC compared with one month ago, according to data from Glassnode.\n\nThe changes are significant compared with sell-offs that accompanied the FTX implosion in Q4 last year.\n\nBitcoin miner net position change chart.

        "title": "Anticipation of Bitcoin Halving Fuels Crypto ETFs - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The price of bitcoin has been soaring lately and a once-every-four-years event could keep upward pressure on the cryptocurrency.\n\nSince the start of the year, bitcoin has risen from around $16,500 to $30,000, a gain of more than 80%. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which closely tracks bitcoin futures, has delivered a similar return.\n\nThough there are many reasons for bitcoin\u2019s recent ascent\u2014including a decline in long-term interest rates and rising appetite for risk among investors\u2014one catalyst that applies to bitcoin specifically is what\u2019s known as the halving.\n\nTo process transactions and keep the blockchain secure, bitcoin relies on the participation of entities called miners who contribute enormous amounts of computing power to the network. In return, the miners receive block rewards (freshly minted bitcoin) as compensation.\n\nThese block rewards are cut in half every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. Currently, block rewards are 6.25 bitcoin per block, and they will fall to 3.125 bitcoin per block after the next halving.\n\nHistorically, the price of bitcoin has risen before, and after these supply reductions, there are many who believe that this time will be no different.\n\nAccording to data from CoinTelegraph, the price of bitcoin was at least 15% higher 150 days after each of the previous three halvings.\n\n\n\nSeparate data from CCData shows that bitcoin rallied ahead of each of those halvings also. The cryptocurrency jumped by 19% in the 12 months leading up to the May 2020 halving; it gained 142% leading up to the July 2016 halving; and it surged 384% leading up to the first halving in November 2012.\n\nAdding Fuel to Crypto ETFs\n\nGiven the strong historical precedent, anticipation of the next bitcoin halving\u2014which is estimated to take place in April or May of 2024\u2014is adding fuel to this year\u2019s bitcoin rally.\n\nIn addition to bitcoin futures tracking ETFs like BITO, funds that hold stocks of companies in the cryptocurrency industry are also rallying on halving excitement.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) and the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) are up anywhere from 90% to 130% on a year-to-date basis.\n\nThese ETFs tend to rise and fall with cryptocurrencies, so anything that pushes bitcoin prices higher is generally a good thing for them.\n\nNo Guarantees\n\nWhile the bitcoin halving was a bullish catalyst for bitcoin in the past, there\u2019s no assurance that history will repeat itself. As with anything in markets, past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nAs bitcoin matures, it won\u2019t necessarily act like it did in its early days. The bullish thesis behind the halving is that with each reduction in block rewards, bitcoin becomes scarcer because there is less new supply coming onto the market.\n\nThat\u2019s true\u2014but it\u2019s also well-known. Bitcoin is designed to have a maximum supply of 21 million; everybody knows that, and in markets, what everybody knows usually isn\u2019t information that can leveraged into outsized returns.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean history won\u2019t repeat and bitcoin runs up into the halving and keeps running for a while after.\n\nBut it\u2019s something that a prudent investor probably shouldn\u2019t bet the farm on.\n\nFollow Sumit Roy on Twitter @sumitroy2\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "content": "SPLIT, CROATIA, April 19, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitcoin Store disrupts the cryptocurrency landscape with innovative walk-in exchanges for easy and secure trading. In the picturesque city of Split, Croatia, The Bitcoin Store is leading the charge in transforming the cryptocurrency landscape with their groundbreaking in-person trading platform. Established by cryptocurrency pioneers, the platform aims to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds of cryptocurrency, democratizing the industry and making it accessible to everyone - regardless of their background or experience. With their game-changing approach, The Bitcoin Store is set to revolutionize personal finance and create a trustworthy space for secure transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Birth of a Vision: A World Where Crypto Is Accessible to All\n\nIn 2013, a pair of long-time friends Tomislav V. and Sime B. identified the enormous promise of cryptocurrencies. Observing the challenges many individuals faced when it came to handling or liquidating their digital assets, they established Bitkonan.com, one of the earliest European cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nLater in 2018 after the bull run, when crypto became more \"mainstream,\" they were surprised that the space still appeared daunting and out of reach for many potential users, especially non-tech individuals.\n\nIn response, they started working on a new idea called \"Bitcoin Store\" - a unique concept that merges the convenience of online exchanges with the accessibility of walk-in stores.\n\n\"Our goal was to create an environment where even the least tech-savvy individuals could manage cryptocurrencies with just a few clicks,\" says Tomislav, CEO of Bitcoin Store.\n\n\"By introducing a chain of walk-in cryptocurency exchanges in major cities alongside an online platform, we make it possible for anyone to buy, sell, and top up their accounts with cash or crypto instantly. Most importantly, we wanted to become a trustworthy crypto companion for non-tech users in a space that still lacks constructive customer support.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA Platform Built on Accessibility, Convenience, and Education\n\nThe Bitcoin Store is more than just a trading platform. It's a movement designed to empower individuals to easily navigate the complex world of digital currencies.\n\nBy developing an approachable and friendly brand personality, the company seeks to foster a strong community and establish trust among its users. Ultimately, The Bitcoin Store aims to make the world of cryptocurrency and fintech accessible to all.\n\nBrick and mortar cryptocurrency exchange: A Safe Haven in a Landscape Seeking Enhanced Customer Experiences\n\nA non-tech user who is unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies may have experienced a sense of confusion or overwhelm, not knowing where to begin when entering the world of crypto.\n\nEven with advancements in user experience and abundant knowledge resources, blockchain technology's technical and economic aspects can still be overwhelming.\n\nFurthermore, despite all these improvements, majority of users report cases of bad customer support with cold or non-existing communication efforts from exchanges.\n\nPhysical cryptocurrency exchanges serve as an ideal starting point for those new to blockchain technology. These exchanges not only facilitate trading but also function as educational centers.\n\nRather than navigating the complexities of an online exchange, a user can receive guidance from an exchange agent who can help set up a digital wallet and explain the various types of cryptocurrency storage and their differences.\n\nRegular users can also benefit from the convenience of visiting a nearby branch for direct support and prompt resolution of potential issues, which is a rarity in the online realm.\n\nFor instance, when encountering a problem on an online exchange, the only available option is usually contacting customer service and potentially waiting hours for a response.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin Store walk-in cryptocurrency exchanges instill trust and security in their users. Before committing to any transactions, a simple internet search can confirm that the exchange is a regulated company adhering to the highest security standards.\n\nThe Future of Personal Finance: Expanding Services and the Store Finance (SEF) Token\n\nThe Bitcoin Store plans to introduce new features such as unique IBAN accounts, physical/virtual credit cards, staking, lending, and loans to further its mission.\n\nAt the heart of this evolving ecosystem will be their new project - Store Finance (SEF), a new feature designed to be the dedicated utility token within the Bitcoin Store network.\n\nBy holding and using SEF tokens, users will enjoy numerous benefits, including:\n\nFee reduction\n\nSEF staking rewards\n\nCashback on a physical VISA credit card\n\nEarly access to new crypto projects via the Bitcoin Store launchpad\n\nRecommendation program benefits\n\nCrypto lending and loan program benefits\n\nJoin the Revolution: The Store Finance (SEF) Presale\n\nThe second round of the Store Finance (SEF) presale is set to commence on April 18, 2023, and will run until April 25, 2023.\n\nThe pre-sale price of tokens will be a fixed 0.2\u20ac per token.\n\nBitcoin Store guarantees a redemption price of 0.1\u20ac per token in the next 2 years!\n\nThe token will be available for purchase exclusively on the Bitcoin Store launchpad site.\n\nDon't miss out on the opportunity to join this groundbreaking ecosystem and help shape the future of personal finance.\n\nAbout The Bitcoin Store\n\nFounded in 2018 in Split, Croatia, The Bitcoin Store is a pioneering brand that connects the physical and online worlds of cryptocurrency trading. With five walk-in stores in major Croatian cities and plans to expand the network across Europe, the company is focused on making the world of cryptocurrency and fintech accessible to users of all backgrounds and experience levels.

        "title": "Intel Kills 'Blockscale' Bitcoin Chip - HPCwire",
        "content": "An interview with Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger from just last year already hasn\u2019t aged well. In the interview, Gelsinger decries the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining (\u201ca climate crisis\u201d) moments before announcing Intel\u2019s own Bitcoin mining product, Blockscale 1000, which Gelsinger claims is \u201cdramatically better\u201d than other power-guzzling chips that take over energy grids. Now, Blockscale is no more, with Gelsinger chopping off the product as part of its cost-cutting efforts to save $10 billion by 2025. The news was originally reported by Tom\u2019s Hardware.\n\n\u201cAs we prioritize our investments in IDM 2.0, we have end-of-lifed the Intel Blockscale 1000 Series ASIC while we continue to support our Blockscale customers,\u201d Intel told HPCwire in an email.\n\nThe Blockscale chip was released last year with expectations that it would serve the fast-growing mining and digital transactions market. Intel sold its chips to infrastructure companies like Argo Blockchain, GRIID Infrastructure and Block.The blockchain chip received support from Raja Koduri, who formerly led Intel\u2019s accelerated computing division, but resigned late last year.\n\nIntel has now posted a document notifying customers of Blockscale\u2019s cancellation.\n\nThe last orders for the product will be taken in October this year, with the last shipments going out in April next year. The document also revealed that Intel had three versions of the Blockscale chip.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Ethereum have converted to a proof-of-stake model, which reduces the strain on GPUs to mine cryptocurrencies. It was a shift from the older proof-of-work model, which awarded coins to the most powerful miners throwing the most hardware resources to solve complex math. That resulted in the buildup of GPU factories to mine cryptocurrency. The proof-of-stake model and its lower reliance on hardware led many miners to repurpose existing GPUs for the purposes of cloud and acceleration of applications.\n\nIn a way, Gelsinger has righted the ship by cutting the Bitcoin chip, which stood out like a sore thumb in Intel\u2019s chip lineup. It was introduced almost as an afterthought to serve a highly volatile market, and it went against Gelsinger\u2019s resolve to focus on engineering and a renewed focus on highly targeted markets.\n\nHive Blockchain, a company that mines bitcoins, in a March filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it expected to receive 645 mining devices called BuzzMiners, and also mentioned the devices were powered by the Intel Blockscale ASIC. It said the number of BuzzMiners in its arsenal would total 6,300 in the coming months. This week, a filing from Hive said the company had received 5,600 BuzzMiners, but made no mention of Intel Blockscale. It also did not mention the number of chips it expected to receive.\n\nHive also uses GPUs for Bitcoin mining, but given the energy prices and difficulty mining Bitcoin, Hive is trying to broaden its GPUs in data centers to run cloud and accelerated computing applications. The company is running a GPU high-performance computing pilot that is \u201cgenerating approximately $1,800/MWh of revenue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese advancements and agility allow us to generate positive gross mining margin during a crypto mining bear market,\u201d Hive wrote in the April filing.\n\nThe market volatility also affected Nvidia and AMD, which could not forecast GPU revenue because of the boom-and-bust nature of the crypto market. During the GPU shortage and Bitcoin boom, miners scalped up most of the available GPUs, which caused prices to skyrocket. Nvidia and AMD were trying to target GPUs at gamers and business users, and ultimately locked out the mining features from its GPUs."

These chips enable miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and secure the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe last of Intel\u2019s chips will reportedly be shipped out in April 2024, two years after they were launched in 2022.\n\nAs energy consumption and environmental concerns surrounding cryptocurrency mining have become increasingly prominent over the years, several major players, including China, have taken steps to regulate or ban cryptocurrency mining activities.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin miners and supporters have argued against the environmental harm caused by the industry.\n\nThe Bitcoin Mining Council, an industry lobbyist backed by MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor and Block\u2019s Jack Dorsey, estimates that in the fourth quarter of 2022, a sustainable energy mix of about 59% powered global Bitcoin mining."

        "title": "Bitcoin mining produces energy gold. Let's use it to help save our planet - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Despite concerns over Bitcoin mining\u2019s energy consumption, Bitcoin mining has the potential to be a net positive for humanity\u2019s relationship with energy and sustainability. This can be achieved by the mining industry using intermittent, stranded and waste power sources and subsidizing sustainable energy. A less-explored opportunity is to collect and redirect the excess heat generated by Bitcoin mining for other heating needs. This Earth Day, let us consider how Bitcoin mining can not only help our planet and improve humanity\u2019s relationship with energy by serving as a buyer of zero-carbon energy, but it can also serve as a producer of recyclable and reusable energy.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s energy recycling potential\n\nMany of Bitcoin\u2019s critics are understandably worried about Bitcoin\u2019s rising energy consumption. The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index indicates that Bitcoin\u2019s electricity consumption has only ever gone up since the digital asset\u2019s inception. Similarly, Bitcoin\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 although there have been ups and downs \u2014 have also grown over time.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption is not the whole story.\n\nBitcoin mining produces a lot of heat, and harnessing and redirecting that excess heat is not just a theoretical possibility. In fact, there are already plans for a Canadian city to be heated by Bitcoin miners. An energy provider, Lonsdale Energy Corporation, and MintGreen, a Bitcoin mining company, are partnering up to provide at least some of the heat demanded by the residents of North Vancouver.\n\nMintGreen will recycle about 20,000 tons of toxic gas per megawatt that would have otherwise entered the atmosphere and contributed to global warming. Instead, this liability of toxic emissions will be turned into an asset: Over 95% of the energy that the miners initially consume will be converted into thermal energy that will be used to heat several buildings. Since Bitcoin miners can run continuously, and because there will almost certainly always be a supply of Bitcoin miners available, the city will be able to rely on their excess heat during any month of any year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis endeavor is not a pie-in-the-sky dream. MintGreen had already made deals with the Vancouver Island Sea Salt facility and Shelter Point Distillery to sell them heat during frigid Canadian winters.\n\nBitcoin mining\u2019s versatility also allows its excess heat to be used for recreational ends. For example, it costs between US$2,000 and US$5,000 to heat a typical swimming pool. Bitcoin mining can turn this money sink and associated energy consumption into a zero-cost endeavor. All you have to do is connect your Bitcoin mining machine to your pool\u2019s water pump. You simultaneously earn the hardest asset ever created and heat your pool at no additional charge.\n\nWhile heating a swimming pool is an amusing application, Bitcoin miners\u2019 excess heat has more profound use cases for humanity. Companies are already collaborating with researchers to create greenhouses that are heated by Bitcoin mining.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the heat from Bitcoin mining is warming a greenhouse for tulips and cutting the flower farmers\u2019 reliance on gas, which has become more expensive since Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. In Sweden, another mining company\u2019s 600-kilowatt ASIC machines\u2019 heat is directed toward warming a 300-square-meter greenhouse in which fruit and vegetables are grown. The miners are embedded in a data center container, which is fitted with an air duct apparatus that draws heat from the ASICs and sends it to the greenhouse. In theory, this would keep the greenhouse at 77 degrees Fahrenheit continuously. Considering that the temperature of the area drops to minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit in wintertime, the potential savings on heat costs and use are significant.\n\nJust as Bitcoin mining can make good use of intermittent, stranded and waste energy sources, recycling and reusing miners\u2019 waste heat can potentially increase the profitability and sustainability of indoor farming and food production. As one researcher said, \u201cA 1 [megawatt] data center would have the ability to strengthen the local self-sufficiency up to 8% with products that are competitive on the market.\u201d\n\nSimmering tensions\n\nNot everyone is excited about Bitcoin miners\u2019 heat, especially those who suffer from its unintended consequences. For example, residents near Seneca Lake in upstate New York have complained that a nearby power plant\u2019s collaboration with over 8,000 miners has caused their lake to \u201cfeel like you\u2019re in a hot tub.\u201d\n\nThe power plant takes in 139 million gallons of water from the lake and gives back 135 million gallons every day. The water that is recycled back into the lake gets up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer. To be sure, solutions can in principle be found, but we must nevertheless admit that sometimes miners\u2019 heat can affect a community\u2019s environment in ways that people do not enjoy.\n\nSustainable energy sources still matter\n\nAside from Bitcoin mining helping subsidize renewable energy, our ability to harness and direct its excess heat is yet another way that Bitcoin can help combat climate change. Less than a decade ago, Imperial College London estimated that heating residential and commercial buildings accounted for almost half of all energy consumption and 40% of all energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. If all of this heat could be provided by carbon-neutral sources, it could be the most revolutionary impact on climate change in a generation.\n\nOn the face of it, replacing carbon-emitting heat sources with the excess heat of Bitcoin miners may not make enough of a difference. After all, if Bitcoin miners are themselves fueled by carbon-intensive fuel sources, then heating one\u2019s home with miners\u2019 excess heat does not necessarily reduce enough emissions for us to meet our climate goals.\n\nBut Bitcoin miners are unique in their ability to render viable renewable energy sources that would have not been profitable in the miners\u2019 absence. Heating commercial and residential buildings with miners\u2019 excess heat really could help put a dent in humanity\u2019s carbon emissions \u2014 provided that the miners themselves are powered by, say, solar energy.\n\nWe have already seen that heating buildings and powering indoor farms with Bitcoin miners\u2019 excess heat is not a pipe dream but a reality. It may not be a big leap to imagine what a difference it could make on our planet if Bitcoin miners could themselves be fueled entirely by carbon-neutral sources."

Secure your seat today\n\nBitcoin miner Mawson Infrastructure (MIGI) said it agreed to sell its sites in Texas to a Singapore fund for $8.5 million in cash and stablecoins.\n\nMainnet Capital's M Turing VCC Oracle Phase 1 Fund will buy Luna Squares Texas LLC, which owns the contracts and leases for the sites in Midland, Texas, Mawson said in a Wednesday press release.\n\nMawson is shedding weight from its operations to focus in Pennsylvania. In September, it sold its facility in Georgia to CleanSpark (CLSK), another bitcoin miner.\n\n\"The proceeds of the sale will be used for further debt reduction, as well as funding future expansions across Mawson\u2019s other sites,\" including acquiring more mining rigs, the company said.\n\nMawson expects to have sufficient infrastructure to support 4.2 exahash/second (EH/s) of mining computing power by the end of the second quarter.\n\nLuna Squares LLC, a separate subsidiary, hosted about 10,000 machines for bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network as of the end of December, according to court filings. Celsius loaned $20 million to Mawson in February 2022, and the two firms discussed another $20 million loan last June.\n\nLuna Squares didn't plan to add more Celsius machines as specified in their contract until the loan went through, the filings said. Luna Squares holds $15.3 million in Celsius deposits, according to the bankruptcy filings.\n\nMawson's shares were recently down 2.5%."

        "content": "The so-called Bitcoin (BTC) soccer team, Real Bedford Football Club, has won the United Kingdom\u2019s South Midlands League for the 2023 season.\n\nFans from all over the world, from Vancouver to Beijing, flew in to watch the last home game and see the trophy raised. Some 327 fans turned up, many of whom had traveled thousands of miles across the globe to watch a non-national league soccer team in a North London town.\n\nSome photos of our final home game of the season where we were crowned league champions.\n\n\n\nWe had a record crowd of 327, this is up from 50-80 last season. Thank you to everyone who came and has supported us. pic.twitter.com/u19kcpO3WM \u2014 Peter McCormack\u200d\u2620\ufe0f (@PeterMcCormack) April 16, 2023\n\nAt the first home game of the season in 2022, Bitcoin podcaster and club chairman Peter McCormack told Cointelegraph that he bought Bedford FC and rebranded it to be Bitcoin-friendly Real Bedford, sharing his vision of one day owning an English Football League side. The move would also put his beloved town of Bedford on the Bitcoin world map.\n\nPitchside and jubilant nine months later, McCormack told Cointelegraph that he\u2019s now one step closer to realizing his soccer league dream. Moreover, the fans and the critics are starting to believe:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an underdog story. The thing is, it\u2019s got more meaning now because there\u2019s coming out and saying \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m going to buy a football team \u2014 making a Bitcoin team and getting it in the Premier League.\u2019 And everyone\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, shut up you w*nker.\u2019 But now, I\u2019ve done the first promotion.\u201d\n\nReal Bedford\u2019s promotion delivers more than just recognition for the club. The club has a Bitcoin logo on its strip, crypto sponsors, and curiously, opposed to a founding date, i.e 2021, the emblem sports a founding block height: 712,003. As Peter explains, the win for Real Bedford is a win for Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cThis is going to sound really cringy. It\u2019s not my team; it\u2019s our team. But it is. It\u2019s our team. It\u2019s our Bitcoin team.\u201d\n\nBitcoin advocates worldwide tuned into live streams of the game during the 2023 season, while stories of Bitcoin soccer fans from Slovakia traveling to Bedford to paint the town red have become local legend. The team has given British Bitcoin advocates a headquarters and Bitcoin sports lovers worldwide a team to rally around.\n\nRelated: UK think tank launches a crusade against \u2018surveillance\u2019 CBDCs\n\nHowever, McCormack is reluctant to push Bitcoin the currency onto his local town: \u201cI don't talk about Bitcoin much here because Bedford's a deprived town, and I don't want people thinking, 'Oh my God, there's that guy who's made some money on Bitcoin. I\u2019m going to buy Bitcoin,\u2019 then they lose their money.\u201d\n\nPeter McCormack shares a joke with Cointelegraph before the game.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin is still 60% lower than its all-time high of 2021, and Bedford, like many U.K. towns, is on the decline. Battered by inflation and economic mismanagement, closing down sales and boarded-up shops overshadow the high street. McCormack explained that it might not be wise to grandstand Bitcoin in such an environment:\n\n\u201cThey [the people of Bedford] can see it, they can come to our [Bitcoin] meetups, but it\u2019s a soft touch. It\u2019s my Trojan horse. It's a Trojan football.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin trojan horse, a meme in the Bitcoin space popularised by Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation, explains that Bitcoin adoption delivers freedom as well as wealth. For McCormack, rather than capturing Troy, he could emulate the success of Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador, but in Bedford:\n\nEach Real Bedford home fixture puts on a pre-game Bitcoin meetup. Locals and traveling Bitcoin enthusiasts ask questions and learn more about the decentralized currency, while Real Bedford merch can be bought using the Lightning Network. A show of hands at the last game of the season demonstrated that, for many people, it was their first real-life interaction with Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to communicate Bitcoin to the country. It's a bit like El Zonte was the seed that turned El Salvador into a Bitcoin country. I want this to be the seed that makes our country understand and have better regulations towards Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIt might be an uphill battle. Despite grassroots efforts from Brits at the Bitcoin Collective and the Bitcoin Policy U.K., government ministers are still trying to understand what Bitcoin is and how to regulate crypto.\n\nPeter McCormack behind the clubhouse bar with the trophy. Source: Twitter\n\nUltimately, the Bitcoin party atmosphere over the weekend\u2013champagne showers, dancing with the kit man, and nights out to the wee hours in Bedford\u2013will have to contend with a country committed to adopting CBDCs or central bank digital currencies while a cohort of the U.K. population is unable to afford basic amenities.\n\nUndeterred and committed to the long game, McCormack told Cointelegraph: \u201cI\u2019m going to be here for the rest of my life here in Bedford at every game I can possibly be at trying to lift up my town.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

However, the carnival it has created since the initial blowup still lives on, and its main characters appear to be doing quite well, too.\n\n\n\nOne of 3AC co-founders, Kyle Davies, appears to have finally found some solace from the experience. After much turmoil, the former hedge fund manager has now transitioned into an aspiring restauranteur fixated on one task \u2014 perfecting the art of cooking chicken.\n\nKyle Davies chopping up \u2026 nothing for some reason. (Twitter)\n\nAny seasoned chef would know that cooking a tender, well-seasoned, juicy and crispy-skinned chicken is a rather exquisite skill. To perfect it, one needs to maintain a razor-sharp focus on the meat while techniques are applied, which requires cutting out distractions \u2014 such as focusing on negative feelings related to creditors trying to claim $3.5 billion from 3AC\u2019s bankruptcy \u2014 during the performance.\n\n\n\nAlso read: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, chefs don\u2019t like customers who are rude.

Although daily volume was only around $13 initially, by the time of publication, the exchange has reached nearly $1.8 million in daily trading volume.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not pleasant being the one to disappoint the crowd, but these numbers are pretty impressive. Consider the fact that the sum of all regulated crypto products listed in Hong Kong only does about $1.19 million in volume per day.\n\nNot that the exchange is playing up its 3AC ties. In an April 14 interview, OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb reportedly said that \u201cWhile Su Zhu and Kyle contributed much in terms of early-stage ideas and vision, they currently are no longer involved in OPNX\u2019s everyday operations.\u201d\n\nHappy Sunday friends \u2022~\u2022 finally some sunshine in HK today \u2600\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/Oce9KLCyJa \u2014 Leslie Lamb (@therealleslamb0) April 16, 2023\n\nIn other 3AC news, on April 19, Sotheby\u2019s auction house announced it would sell a series of NFT collections recovered by liquidators, including Dmitri Cherniak\u2019s artwork \u201cThe Golden Goose,\u201d purchased by Davies and Zhu with $5.8 million in Ether in August 2021.\n\n\n\nZhu appears to have taken the news philosophically, quoting the famed English poet Alfred Tennyson: \u201c[Tis] better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all,\u201d while highlighting the NFT auction for his followers. 3AC\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings are currently ongoing.\n\nIn a post to followers, Su Zhu bids his audience \u201cgood morning\u201d and asks for \u201cgood vibes only.\u201d (Twitter)\n\nSingaporean Bitcoin miner\u2019s wild week\n\nOn April 14, shares of Singaporean Bitcoin (BTC) mining operator SAI.TECH, listed on the Nasdaq exchange, surged by over 360% in one day to a high of $7.42 before giving back much of its gains. The stock is currently trading at $3.68 per share at the time of publication. There was no material news preceding the unusual price action \u2014 and we certainly tried to identify some.\n\n\n\nSAI.TECH develops Bitcoin mining infrastructure hardware, namely Saihub, Tankbox, and Rackbox, that utilizes liquid cooling and waste heat recovery solutions to improve efficiency for miners.\n\nOn April 20, the company consolidated its product lines into three categories; Ultiaas, Boltbit, and Heatnuc. Boltbit will focus on providing decentralized transaction system services and technical support, while Heatnuc focuses on the \u201cresearch and promotion of small modular reactors.\u201d Ultiaas puts the emphasis on hardware and software products that convert mining chip heat to reusable energy.\n\nThe company terminated its Phase II 90 megawatts (MW) crypto mining and hosting expansion plan in Kazakhstan last year following a \u201cforce majeure,\u201d and will continue to execute its Phase I 15 MW agreement for the same purpose. In January 2022, the Kazakh government resigned following protests and shut down access to the internet, disrupting the operations of Bitcoin miners in the country.

Between April 12 to April 14, the Bruce Lee Foundation, directed by his daughter Shannon, partnered with NFT video platform Shibuya to launch The House of Lee collection to celebrate the life and work of the namesake Kung Fu legend. A total of 48,691 NFTs were minted at a price of 0.008 Ether (ETH), to 6,452 owners (13% unique).\n\n\n\nThere was one slight issue, only one NFT was unique in the collection, that of the House of Lee Genesis NFT. With an abundance of supply, the floor price of the collection quickly dropped to around 0.003 ETH apiece on OpenSea at the time of publication. The sale still grossed approximately $730,000, minus the cost of placing a mega billboard advertisement for the NFT drop on Broadway.\n\n\n\nStart spreading the news\u20265 hours left to get your ticket to House of Lee.\n\nPress link \u2014> https://t.co/GlB6iylbsd\n\n\n\n*Apple Pay Accepted@shibuyaxyz @pplpleasr1 pic.twitter.com/4HltFEM2fV \u2014 Bruce Lee (@brucelee) April 13, 2023\n\nWhile the initial sale may have been somewhat lukewarm, the NFTs are billed as \u201cYour ticket to the House of Lee,\u201d and there are reports that this is a mere first stage of an ongoing Web3 collaboration.

(Nasdaq: WULF) (\u201cTeraWulf\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), owners and operators of vertically integrated, domestic Bitcoin mining facilities powered by more than 91% zero-carbon energy, today announced that the Company has now fully energized its 50-MW stake in the Nautilus Cryptomine facility, a joint venture with Cumulus Coin, LLC.\n\nThe Nautilus facility represents the first behind-the-meter Bitcoin mining facility of its kind, directly sourcing reliable, carbon-free, 24x7 baseload power from the 2.5 GW Susquehanna nuclear generation station in Pennsylvania. The Company successfully deployed its full share in phase one of the facility - 50 MW and 1.9 EH/s \u2013 ahead of schedule. TeraWulf has the option to add an additional 50 MW of mining capacity at the Nautilus facility, which the Company plans to deploy in future phases.\n\nWith TeraWulf\u2019s stake in the Nautilus facility now fully ramped to 50 MW, the Company currently has an operating hashrate of 4 EH/s, reflecting a nearly 100% increase year to date. TeraWulf has an operational fleet of approximately 34,500 of the latest generation miners, comprised of 18,500 miners at its wholly owned Lake Mariner facility in New York (5,000 of which are hosted) and 16,000 self-miners at the nuclear-powered Nautilus facility in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cOur team has been working swiftly and diligently to achieve our stated goal of reaching 5.5 EH/s of operational mining capacity in Q2 2023,\u201d said Paul Prager, Chairman and CEO of TeraWulf. \u201cDeploying 50 MW of mining capacity at the Nautilus facility is an important milestone for the Company. Not only does it represent the first nuclear-powered Bitcoin mining facility in the U.S., but TeraWulf now has the opportunity to realize the economic advantage of 50 MW of zero-carbon mining at what is arguably the lowest contracted power cost in the sector \u2013 just $0.02/kWh for a term of five years,\u201d continued Prager.\n\nIn addition to the 50 MW of self-mining capacity online now at Nautilus, TeraWulf currently has 60 MW operational at Lake Mariner and is in final stages of construction on Building 2, which will increase Lake Mariner\u2019s operational capacity to over 110 MW in the coming weeks. Combined, the Company expects to have a total operational capacity of 50,000 miners (5.5 EH/s) in Q2 2023, representing approximately 160 MW of power demand.\n\nAbout TeraWulf\n\nTeraWulf (Nasdaq: WULF) owns and operates vertically integrated, environmentally clean Bitcoin mining facilities in the United States. Led by an experienced group of energy entrepreneurs, the Company currently has two Bitcoin mining facilities: the wholly owned Lake Mariner facility in New York, and the Nautilus Cryptomine facility in Pennsylvania, a joint venture with Cumulus Coin, LLC. TeraWulf generates domestically produced Bitcoin powered by nuclear, hydro, and solar energy with a goal of utilizing 100% zero-carbon energy. With a core focus on ESG that ties directly to its business success, TeraWulf expects to offer attractive mining economics at an industrial scale.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

The truth is, getting involved is very easy. Keep reading to see what I mean.\n\nChoosing a reputable site\n\nWith many gaming options, it\u2019s not easy to decide. You can become distracted by one site\u2019s perks and ignore other important things.\n\nThat\u2019s why sticking with the BTC casinos on this page is your best option. Once you make the decision, it\u2019s time to get started.\n\nFirst off, ensure the casino accepts players from your country. It should also offer your desired cryptos for deposits and withdrawals.\n\nOpening an account\n\nVisit the chosen Bitcoin casino's website. Click the \"Sign Up\" or \"Register\" button.\n\nNext, provide the required information. This usually includes an email address, username, password, and sometimes personal details.\n\nComplete the registration process by following the instructions provided. It\u2019s important to take note of the welcome bonus package and restrictions.\n\nBuying cryptocurrency\n\nYou'll need to acquire some if you don't own crypto assets. Choose a reputable cryptocurrency exchange to purchase the desired crypto.\n\nBinance is the best option for gamblers. It allows you to transfer money with no punishments. In contrast, exchanges like Coinbase forbid the practice.\n\nPopular digital coins for gambling include Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA).\n\nYour next step is to create an account on the chosen exchange, complete the necessary verification steps and deposit funds.\n\nOnce you fund your account, purchase the desired amount of cryptocurrency.\n\nDepositing money\n\nLog into your crypto casino account. Navigate to the \"Deposit\" or \"Wallet\" section. Select the cryptocurrency you want to deposit and generate a unique deposit address.\n\nGo to your cryptocurrency wallet/exchange and start a transfer to the provided deposit address. Wait for confirmation of the transaction on the blockchain. This process may take seconds or minutes.\n\nNavigating the site and playing games\n\nOnce the platform confirms the transfer, the funds appear in your casino account.\n\nExplore the site and browse the available games. These could include craps, table games, keno, and lottery games.\n\nSelect the game you want to play and click on it to access the interface. Follow the game's instructions and place your wagers using your deposited cryptocurrency.\n\nWithdrawing money\n\nIf you want to withdraw your funds, go to the \"Withdraw\" or \"Cashier\" section. Choose the coin you wish to withdraw and enter the desired amount.\n\nProvide the required wallet address where you want to send the funds. Ensure the address is correct. Double-check the withdrawal details and confirm the transaction.\n\nWait for the withdrawal to be processed. The time it takes can vary depending on the casino and blockchain network.\n\nA Quick Guide to Choosing the #1 Crypto Casino for You\n\nWhen you choose the best crypto casino, there are several factors to consider. Here is some general information about what you should focus on. Follow these tips to help you make an informed decision.\n\nWithdrawal speed and limits\n\nLook for a crypto casino that offers fast and efficient withdrawals. Stick with providers that have reasonable withdrawal limits that suit your needs.\n\nSome casinos may impose daily, weekly, or monthly limits on withdrawals. However, customers should note that many BTC casinos no longer have withdrawal limits.\n\nAvailability in your country\n\nMake sure that the cryptocurrency casino accepts players from your country. Some platforms have restrictions on certain jurisdictions. Thus, it's essential to verify this information before signing up.\n\nReputation\n\nAlso, research the reputation of the casino site before making a decision. Look for user reviews and ratings from reliable sources.\n\nConsider how long the casino has been operating. Additionally, please note whether it has any significant/well-known licenses or certifications.\n\nNumber of payment methods\n\nCheck the variety of crypto payment options accepted by the casino. A wider range of options allows you to choose the one that suits you best.\n\nLook for casinos that support popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC). Other available coins may include Tron (TRX), Ripple (XRP), and Tether (USDT).\n\nIt may also be worthwhile to check whether other different payment options are available, just for the sake of variety. For instance, many crypto casinos worth their salt also offer the chance to play using eWallets, as is the case with actual PayPal casinos.\n\nEnd-to-end casino\n\nAn end-to-end crypto casino operates entirely on blockchain technology. The best ones offer provably fair games and transparent transactions.\n\nIf privacy and fairness are important to you, choose an end-to-end casino. Otherwise, you must pay extra transaction fees.\n\nQuality of customer support\n\nGamblers should know the importance of reliable customer support.\n\nEnsure the casino offers responsive and helpful customer support options. These could include live chat, email, or phone support.\n\nTest their support channels, if possible, to gauge their effectiveness.\n\nBonuses and Promos\n\nHigh-quality crypto casinos often offer enticing welcome bonuses and promotions. Aside from this, a good VIP program is also a great way to attract and retain players. Here are some common examples of promos and bonuses on BTC casinos.\n\nWelcome bonuses\n\nNew players get these rewards upon signing up and making their first deposit. They typically come in the form of a match bonus.\n\nIn this case, the casino matches a percentage of the player's deposit up to a certain amount. For example, a 100% match bonus up to 1 BTC means the casino will double your deposit up to 1 BTC.\n\nHowever, these casino bonuses usually come with a wagering requirement.\n\nNo deposit bonuses\n\nSome crypto casinos offer a no-deposit bonus, which involves Bitcoin casino sites topping up your account without you depositing money.\n\nThese giveaways allow you to try casino games without risking any money. But it is a fact that tight wagering restrictions apply here too.\n\nFree spins\n\nFree spins are bonuses you can use on crypto slot games. They provide a certain number of spins on selected slot machines.\n\nIn theory, there\u2019s a chance you can win real money without using your funds. Alas, few casino sites pay out decent sums.\n\nReload bonuses\n\nReload bonuses are offered to existing players when they make further deposits. These bonuses encourage players to continue playing and depositing at the casino.\n\nCashback\n\nA high-quality crypto business may offer cashback programs. You receive a percentage of your losses back as a bonus. This helps counteract potential losses and encourages you to keep playing.\n\nVIP programs\n\nA loyalty or VIP club rewards regular and high-rolling players. These programs typically have multiple tiers. You can advance through the tiers by collecting loyalty points or meeting certain wagering requirements.\n\nThe gambling industry is full of poor-quality VIP programs. The best sites offer personalized customer support, higher withdrawal limits, and exclusive bonuses. They also have cool prizes, such as access to special events and luxury gifts.\n\nReviewing Bitcoin Casinos: How CCN Does It\n\nAs a reputable crypto casino review site, we thoroughly evaluate different platforms. The process involves simulating the experience of a genuine player.\n\nHere's how the CCN team reviews each site on this page and beyond.\n\nRegistration and geo-restrictions\n\nWe register an account on the crypto casino platform. This means providing accurate and truthful information. If there are Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, we meet them.\n\nOur reviewers take note of geo-restrictions or country-specific limitations. They check whether the platform accepts players from their location or if any restrictions are in place. If something seems wrong to us, we include it in our review.\n\nDeposit and wagering requirements\n\nNext, we make a deposit using a selected cryptocurrency. We observe the deposit process and transaction times.\n\nOur team also examines the terms and conditions of the casino's crypto bonuses. These include the wagering requirements to evaluate their fairness.\n\nWe also analyze how easily players can meet these requirements. For instance, playing through 60 times your deposit is unreasonable.\n\nGameplay and game quality\n\nNow, it is time to explore the variety and quality of games on the gaming platform. We play crypto bingo, table games, bingo, and more.\n\nOur reviews should be your first (and perhaps only) stop when it comes to finding great games. For example, we have a page that tells you where you can find the top crypto slots games. Save yourself time and stress by checking it out.\n\nOur reviewers assess the gameplay experience. They consider factors such as graphics, user interface, and smoothness of gameplay.\n\nWe then evaluate the games to ensure they are provably fair.\n\nCustomer support engagement\n\nA big part of our process involves looking at the standard of chat support. We get the ball rolling and initiate contact with the casino's customer support team. Our reviewers find out the speed of response on the live chat and email channels.\n\nWe assess the responsiveness and professionalism of the support agents. Do they address our questions and provide adequate support? If not, we highlight this in our reviews.\n\nWithdrawal process and obstacles\n\nWe always ensure there is something left in our account to withdraw. Our reviewers analyze the available payment methods and withdrawal times.\n\nThey pay attention to potential obstacles or delays in the withdrawal process. Issues might include lengthy verification procedures or excessive withdrawal limits.\n\nGathering feedback from players\n\nFinally, we gather feedback from real players who have played crypto games on the casino we\u2019ve reviewed. This feedback is collected through user reviews, forums and social media.\n\nWe consider this feedback to gain insights into overall player satisfaction. Also, we address any common issues or concerns the player community raises.\n\nThanks to this process, CCN provides valuable and detailed information. It helps you make informed decisions when you choose a platform.\n\nHere\u2019s Why You Should Play at Crypto Casinos\n\nChoosing a BTC casino could appeal if you want a pleasant online gambling experience. Here are the key reasons why someone might choose a crypto-gambling platform.\n\nPrivacy and anonymity\n\nCrypto casinos provide a higher level of privacy and anonymity compared to traditional fiat casinos.\n\nTransactions are conducted using cryptocurrencies. This digital currency is decentralized and offers pseudonymous transfers. Thus, you maintain your privacy as your identity remains secret.\n\nThere is no need to reveal your name, phone number, or address on a BTC casino.\n\nFaster payments and higher withdrawal limits\n\nCrypto transactions are usually faster compared to traditional banking methods. Cryptocurrency withdrawals are often processed quickly. Thus, you can access your funds promptly.\n\nAlso, crypto casinos often have higher withdrawal limits compared to fiat ones. This means that you can take out larger sums of money at once.\n\nApart from crypto options, you can still use other payment methods. For instance, you can pay with eWallets like Skrill and PayPal. Other options include bank transfers, debit cards, and credit cards like Visa and MasterCard.\n\nStarting fresh if restricted by fiat sites\n\nCrypto casinos provide an opportunity for users who face restrictions or limitations on fiat gambling sites.\n\nBy switching to a crypto casino, you can bypass these restrictions. Thus, you can access a broader range of online gambling options.\n\nPotential value appreciation\n\nCryptocurrencies have shown the potential for significant value appreciation. Crypto casino users can benefit from any potential increases in the value of their chosen coin. This could lead to additional gains beyond their gambling winnings.\n\nModern website design\n\nCrypto casinos often prioritize modern and user-friendly website designs. These platforms offer sleek and intuitive interfaces. The outcome is a visually appealing and enjoyable gambling experience.\n\nAccessibility and play from anywhere\n\nCrypto casinos offer greater accessibility to players worldwide. It is possible for you to access one of these platforms in a surprising number of locations.\n\nNonetheless, it is wise to check the laws surrounding cryptocurrency AND online casino gambling in your country.\n\nProtection against fiat currency devaluation\n\nCryptocurrencies are not subject to the same inflationary pressures as fiat currencies. Players can potentially shield their funds from the constant devaluation of traditional fiat currencies by using cryptocurrencies in a casino.\n\nIt's crucial to consider the potential risks of crypto gambling. These include volatility in prices and the need for responsible gambling practices.\n\nHowever, a crypto casino can provide an appealing alternative to traditional fiat gambling sites. It offers enhanced privacy, faster transactions, and the potential for additional financial benefits.\n\nGame Availability on Crypto Casinos\n\nCrypto casinos offer various games to cater to different preferences and interests. Before getting your altcoins ready, read about the following popular games.\n\nRoulette\n\nYou play crypto roulette on a wheel divided into numbered compartments, typically from 0 to 36. The numbers are alternately colored in red and black.\n\nPopular variants of roulette include:\n\nEuropean roulette (with a single zero)\n\nAmerican roulette (with a single zero and double zero)\n\nFrench roulette (similar to European roulette with additional betting options and rules)\n\nThe 0 and sometimes 00 lie within a green color. You place wagers where you think the ball will land on the wheel.\n\nRoulette bets and payouts\n\nRoulette offers a variety of betting options, including:\n\nInside bets: You place these wagers on specific numbers or small groups of adjacent numbers. They have higher payouts but lower odds of winning\n\nYou place these wagers on specific numbers or small groups of adjacent numbers. They have Outside bets: You stake money on larger groups of numbers. Other options include red or black, even or odd, or high or low numbers. They have shorter odds of winning, but offer lower payouts\n\nThe payouts in roulette depend on the type of gamble. For instance, a straight bet (betting on a single number) has the highest payout of 35:1. Meanwhile, an even/odd or red/black bet has a payout of 1:1.\n\nBaccarat\n\nA baccarat game occurs between the player and the banker. The objective is to have a hand value as close to 9 as possible. You can wager on the player's hand, the banker's hand, or a tie.\n\nIn baccarat, cards 2 to 9 retain face value. Tens and face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth zero. Aces have a value of 1.\n\nThe hand value is determined by adding the individual card values and taking the second digit of the total. For instance, a score of 10 becomes 0 in baccarat. A total of 13 means 3, etc.\n\nThe drawing of additional cards in baccarat follows specific rules. For example, if the player's total is 5 or less, they receive a third card. The banker's actions depend on their hand total and the value of the player's third card.\n\nBaccarat odds\n\nBaccarat offers different payouts, depending on the bet type. Gambling on the player or the banker and winning results in a 1:1 payout. Yet, you must pay a commission on banker wagers.\n\nWagering on a tie typically offers higher payouts, such as 8:1 or 9:1. Still, it has a higher house edge.\n\nSlots\n\nSlots feature spinning reels with various symbols. The goal is to line up matching symbols on designated paylines to win prizes.\n\nCrypto casinos offer various slot games with different themes. They might include adventure, fantasy, mythology, and pop culture.\n\nThere are also various slot variations. For example, you can play classic slots with three reels and simpler gameplay. Alternatively, treat yourself to 3D slots with immersive graphics and bonus features.\n\nMany slots incorporate bonus features. Examples include free spins, multipliers, wild symbols, and mini-games. These additions add excitement and enhance the potential for bigger wins.\n\nSlot jackpots and fairness\n\nPretty much everyone wants to win progressive jackpots with huge prize pools. These crypto slot games offer prizes worth six or even seven figures on occasion.\n\nSlots operate using a random number generator (RNG), ensuring fair and random outcomes. The RNG generates thousands of numbers per second, determining the symbols on the reels.\n\nVideo Poker\n\nVideo poker combines elements of traditional poker and slot machines. The result is an engaging and strategic gameplay experience.\n\nIn video poker, players get a five-card hand. They can hold or discard cards to create the best possible poker hand.\n\nBitcoin casinos offer various video poker variants. Popular ones include:\n\nJacks or Better\n\nDeuces Wild\n\nJoker Poker\n\nBonus Poker\n\nEach variant has its own specific rules and payout structures.\n\nVideo poker hands\n\nVideo poker follows standard poker hand rankings. You can get pairs, two pairs, three-of-a-kind, and a straight.\n\nThe flush, full house, four-of-a-kind, and straight flush hands are very valuable. However, the coveted royal flush tends to offer the biggest payout.\n\nEach video poker game has a specific paytable that outlines the payouts for different hand combinations. Players aim to achieve the highest-paying hand according to the paytable.\n\nPlinko\n\nPlinko is an entertaining game that originated from the popular television show \"The Price Is Right.\"\n\nOn the best sites for crypto Plinko, you benefit from a visually appealing and interactive gaming experience. You watch as the ball goes through the pegs. You anticipate where it will land and what prize you will win.\n\nPlinko prizes\n\nIn crypto casinos, Plinko games often involve dropping the ball down a pegged board. Various prizes are assigned to different slots where the ball lands.\n\nYou select your wager amount and release the ball. It bounces down the pegged board, finally landing in one of the prize slots at the bottom.\n\nCrypto Plinko often features multipliers, allowing players to win bigger prizes. The value of the multiplier varies depending on where the ball lands.\n\nBlackjack\n\nIn blackjack, the objective is to obtain a score closer to 21 than the dealer without getting 22+.\n\nYou receive two cards initially. Choose to hit (receive another card) or stand (take no more cards).\n\nYou can also double down (double your initial wager and receive one more card) or split (if your initial two cards have the same value).\n\nNumbered cards retain face value. Tens and face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10. The Ace is worth 1 or 11, depending on the player's choice.\n\nBlackjack payouts\n\nIn blackjack, winning hands typically pay out at a 1:1 ratio. This means you receive your initial stake plus an equal amount as winnings.\n\nAchieving a hand value of 21 with the first two cards (an Ace and a 10-value card) is called a blackjack. It is the highest-ranking hand and typically pays out at a higher rate, often 3:2.\n\nThe best crypto casinos offer various blackjack variants. These might include European and Atlantic City blackjack. Each variant may have slight rule variations or side wagers to add excitement and variety.\n\nSports options\n\nTop-rated BTC casinos offer various sports betting options to cater to sports enthusiasts.\n\nBasketball, horse racing, greyhound racing, and American football are among the best-known. Apart from these, you can also engage in soccer betting with Bitcoin.\n\nYou should also have a wide selection of markets to choose from. With plenty of ways to gamble, punters are spoiled for choice. Indeed, some cryptocurrency casinos have hundreds, perhaps thousands, of markets.\n\nWhat do crypto sportsbooks offer?\n\nThe most popular crypto sports markets include:\n\nPre-match\n\nIn-play\n\nParlay\n\nThe spread\n\nOver/under\n\nProposition wagers\n\nThere are lots of ways to get in on the action.\n\nAdded to this, a high-quality site can act as a mobile casino. It achieves this by letting you download an app.\n\nYou are no longer confined to playing games on your desktop. Whether you use Android or iOS, a cryptocurrency casino should cater to your needs.\n\nCrash\n\nIn Crash, you place your wagers on a multiplier value. The multiplier starts at a base value of 1.00x and begins to rise.\n\nYou can cash out before the game crashes to secure your winnings. However, you lose your wager if you don\u2019t cash out before the crash.\n\nThe multiplier value in Crash increases continuously until the game ends. You aim to cash out at the highest possible multiplier before the crash. The higher the multiplier when cashing out, the bigger the payout.\n\nCrash strategy\n\nCrash is very much a game of risk and timing. You need to decide when to cash out to maximize your winnings.\n\nCashing out too early means potential missed profits. Meanwhile, cashing out too late results in losing your money.\n\nIf you\u2019re risk averse, you might decide to cash out on low multipliers for a high win rate. Those looking for the big win must hold their nerve for what seems like forever!\n\nYou might find different variations of this game on the best crash gambling sites. Such titles might have cool features such as adjustable risk levels and bonus rounds.\n\nAre There Any Reasons Not to Try Crypto Casinos?\n\nThere are many pros to using the best Bitcoin casinos. Yet it's important to know the cons and potential risks involved. Here are some key considerations.\n\nLack of consumer protection\n\nBTC casinos often operate in a less regulated environment. This contrasts with fiat casinos regulated by established authorities.\n\nIn the case of scams or fraud, recovering funds or seeking legal recourse is challenging. After all, digital assets are decentralized, and transactions are irreversible.\n\nIrreversibility of transactions\n\nOnce a cryptocurrency transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, you can\u2019t reverse it. If you send funds to the wrong address or fall victim to a scam, you won\u2019t be able to retrieve your funds.\n\nThis highlights the importance of double-checking transaction details before finalizing transfers.\n\nRequired knowledge of cryptocurrencies\n\nUsing Bitcoin casinos requires a certain level of understanding and familiarity with cryptocurrencies.\n\nYou must know how to securely acquire, store, and transfer cryptocurrencies. Lack of experience or knowledge may result in mistakes or vulnerabilities.\n\nA legal and regulatory gray area\n\nThe legality and regulation of crypto casinos vary across jurisdictions. Some countries have clear regulations for online gambling. But others may not have specific laws or regulations addressing crypto gambling.\n\nThis can create a legal gray area. It is a situation that raises concerns about the legitimacy and accountability of BTC casinos.\n\nThis is why it's essential to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before engaging with any crypto casino.\n\nConsider the platform's reputation, user reviews, licenses, and security measures. Additionally, ensure you have a secure wallet to store your cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe volatility of the currency\n\nCryptocurrencies are known for their price volatility. The value of a cryptocurrency can fluctuate significantly within short periods. This volatility can affect the value of your deposits and winnings, potentially leading to gains or losses.\n\nStablecoins to the Rescue?\n\nUsing stablecoins in a crypto casino can offer several benefits. Here's why these assets are worth considering.\n\nStability of value\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value. They are often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar.\n\nThis stability helps reduce the volatility risks associated with other cryptos. Using stablecoins, players can enjoy a more predictable and consistent value for their wagers.\n\nThis contrasts with Ethereum casinos, for example, where volatility is always an issue.\n\nFaster and efficient transactions\n\nStablecoins typically operate on blockchain networks. They facilitate faster and more efficient transactions than traditional banking methods.\n\nUsing stablecoins on a crypto casino leads to quicker deposit and withdrawal processes. This fact reduces the waiting time for transaction confirmation.\n\nPrivacy and anonymity\n\nJust like other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins provide privacy and anonymity in transactions. You can maintain your privacy and limit the disclosure of personal information.\n\nGlobal accessibility\n\nStablecoins offer global accessibility since they are not tied to any specific country or banking system. Players from various regions can use stablecoins on crypto casinos without currency conversion or international transaction issues.\n\nThis allows for a more inclusive and seamless gambling experience for players worldwide.\n\nTransparent and auditable transactions\n\nStablecoins are often built on public blockchain networks. The result is transparency and the ability to verify transactions. This transparency ensures fair play and allows players to audit their transactions.\n\nIt's important to note that the availability of stablecoins may vary across different crypto casinos. Before using stablecoins, ensure the casino accepts the specific stablecoin you intend to buy.\n\nIs It Even Legal to Play at BTC Casinos?\n\nThe legality of using cryptocurrency for online gambling varies depending on where you live.\n\nSome countries have embraced and regulated cryptos. Unfortunately, though, others have imposed restrictions or outright bans. Punters in these countries usually make good use of other types of casinos using fiat currency, especially mobile casinos.\n\nFor instance, you can use crypto in Lithuania, Netherlands, Spain and Canada. But it is an illegal act in Algeria, China, and Egypt.\n\nResidents of France, meanwhile, can access online crypto sports betting. But online casino gaming remains illegal.\n\nWhat about gambling online?\n\nIn some regions, there are clear regulations for online gambling. Such locations may include special provisions for crypto casinos.\n\nFor instance, a company may need a certain license to proceed. The Curacao eGaming license is often the bare minimum.\n\nOn the other hand, some countries may not have specific laws addressing cryptocurrency gambling, creating a legal gray area.\n\nIn such cases, the legality of Bitcoin casinos is ambiguous. Thus, you should exercise caution and consider the potential risks involved.\n\nThere are legal consequences if you gamble in a country that forbids the practice. Punishments can include fines and even imprisonment.\n\nBefore registering with any crypto casino, review the rules surrounding digital currency and gambling in your country. Also, choose brands that legally operate in your nation.\n\nChoosing reputable and licensed operators is important to ensure a safe and fair gaming experience.\n\nCrypto Casinos Offer a New Way to Play\n\nIt is time to send fiat gambling sites to the trash where they belong. The crypto market is growing, and it\u2019s time people said \u2018yes\u2019 to BTC casinos.\n\nThey offer thousands of great games and cool bonuses like rakeback, cashback, and referral benefits. You can choose your preferred payment method and try classic games like blackjack and baccarat.\n\nAlso, the best crypto casinos act like sportsbooks. They offer bettors the chance to access products such as sports betting markets. You can wager on almost any sport, including ice hockey, basketball, and baseball.\n\nSo, there is no reason to settle for below-average fiat sites. It is time to steer in a different direction; crypto casinos.\n\nHow To Gamble Responsibly on an Online Casino\n\nUsing a Bitcoin casino is the basis of privacy and a more enjoyable user experience. It keeps the banks out of your financial affairs too.\n\nHowever, there are challenges to face. Your safety is at risk if you don\u2019t exercise caution when playing.\n\nHere are some tips to help you gamble responsibly.\n\nSet a budget\n\nBefore you start gambling, set a budget you are comfortable with losing. Only gamble with the money you can afford to lose without impacting your essential expenses or financial stability.\n\nEstablish time limits\n\nSet specific time limits for your gambling sessions. Avoid spending excessive time gambling. Otherwise, you could neglect other important aspects of your life.\n\nAvoid chasing losses\n\nIt's crucial to understand that gambling is based on chance. This points to the fact that losses are a natural part of the experience.\n\nAvoid chasing losses by increasing your wagers or playing more frequently. Accept them as part of the game. Don't try to recoup them through risky or impulsive behavior.\n\nTake breaks\n\nRegularly take a break to clear your mind and maintain a healthy balance in your life. Get involved in other activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, sports, or spending time with family and friends.\n\nDon't borrow or gamble with credit\n\nAvoid borrowing money or using credit to gamble. This can lead to financial difficulties and create a cycle of debt. Only gamble with the money you have set aside for entertainment purposes.\n\nBe aware of your emotional state\n\nGambling can evoke strong emotions, such as excitement or frustration. Be aware of your emotional state. Avoid gambling when you\u2019re stressed, depressed, or under the influence of substances that may impair your judgment.\n\nUse self-exclusion tools\n\nMany reputable gambling platforms offer self-exclusion options. They allow you to restrict your access to their services for a specified period.\n\nIf you need a break from gambling, consider these tools to help you stay in control.\n\nSeek support\n\nSeek support if you believe your gambling habits are becoming problematic or cannot control your gambling impulses. Contact trusted friends or family members.\n\nAlso, consider contacting helplines or support groups that help individuals with gambling-related issues.\n\nRemember, gambling should be viewed as entertainment. Responsible gambling practices are crucial to maintaining a healthy balance in your life. By following these tips, you can enjoy gambling safely and responsibly.\n\nAlso, check the laws of your jurisdiction to determine the legal gambling age. Don\u2019t assume that the minimum age is 18, as some places have set it at 21.\n\nFAQ\n\nHere is some important information about crypto casinos as a reward for making it this far.\n\nWhat companies are considered the best software providers? A gambling platform\u2019s quality is determined by the game providers it uses. These days, the top-rated brands in this department include Pragmatic Play, Evolution Gaming, Betsoft, and Microgaming. Do crypto casinos offer support in languages other than English? Yes! The best Bitcoin casinos have support staff that speak Russian, Italian, Chinese, German, and French, among other languages. This is great news, as you get the most out of a site\u2019s chat feature when you fully understand what the customer service team member says. How do I know to trust a BTC casino? You can look at site functionality to get a clue as to whether the brand is legit. However, you should also examine its licensing, history, and online reputation. If you see any red flags, avoid registering, regardless of how good its deposit match is. The easiest option is to use one of the crypto casinos on this page. Who owns the most trusted Bitcoin casinos out there? The platforms featured on this page, of course! Sites like Betonline, 7Bit Casino, Fortune Jack, and Betonline are highly regarded. Stake, Cloudbet, BitStarz, Wild.io, and Metaspins, are also well respected. However, there\u2019s no guarantee that these crypto casinos serve players in your country. What are the minimum deposit requirements at crypto casinos? You\u2019ll need to check our reviews to find out more. However, I can tell you that on rare occasions, you\u2019ll find no deposit crypto casinos. As the name suggests, such sites let you get started without depositing any money as they offer a small welcome bonus. Otherwise, it is typical for crypto casinos to set the minimum deposit requirement at between $5 and $10. What casinos offer the widest range of available games? The huge level of competition in the industry means that crypto casinos are having to improve their selection of games. It isn\u2019t unusual for a top-rated platform to offer 5,000+ games! Granted, these may be variations on perhaps 100+ titles but some are genuinely interesting takes on classics. Read our reviews to find the crypto casinos with the best selection of games.\n\nRundown of the Best Crypto & Bitcoin Casinos in 2024"

        "content": "The following is a guest post by Cath Schwartz.\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrency is undeniable. Despite its volatile market, we\u2019ve recently seen wide adoption of this digital currency. Many would say that crypto is the future of money.\n\nThe global crypto population increased by a whopping 178% in 2021. It has grown from 106 million in January to 295 million in December of last year. Here\u2019s the catch: the number of crypto owners might hit one billion by the end of this year.\n\nDoes this mean that the e-commerce industry is already using crypto? The answer is yes.\n\nThis page is a practical guide to e-commerce cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\n\nSimply put, cryptocurrency is a form of virtual currency. This digital asset gets distributed across a large number of computers. However, people cannot counterfeit it due to cryptography.\n\nAs an encrypted digital payment, crypto can be used and exchanged among users. That\u2019s where e-commerce cryptocurrency comes in.\n\nHow crypto works\n\nCryptocurrency works on a decentralized network using blockchain technology. What does this mean? Consider two things:\n\nDecentralization: cryptocurrency is decentralized since no central authority issues and controls it. It means governments cannot regulate this virtual currency and interfere with its transactions.\n\nBlockchain: This technology entails a distributed ledger in a different network of computers. It essentially has a set of connected blocks. Each contains a series of transactions verified by each network member.\n\nIn addition, understand that cryptocurrencies can either be:\n\nMined: Cryptocurrency mining entails verifying transactions and recording these on digital ledgers.\n\nPurchased: You can buy and sell crypto from exchanges that work like a broker.\n\nCommon cryptocurrencies in the market\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the most common cryptocurrencies today:\n\nBitcoin (BTC): It\u2019s the original and most popular cryptocurrency worldwide. It was introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous developer under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. It has led to the inception of other cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The second most popular cryptocurrency globally. Ethereum, a blockchain-based software platform, was developed in 2015 with its own crypto, ETH. Unlike BTC, it\u2019s both a platform and a cryptocurrency.\n\nLitecoin: It\u2019s also one of the pioneers in the crypto market. Launched in 2011, it followed the footsteps of BTC as the \u2018lite\u2019 version. But unlike BTC, it can produce its coins at scale.\n\nWhat is e-commerce cryptocurrency?\n\nBy definition, e-commerce cryptocurrency is a digital currency used for online business transactions. This means consumers use crypto like bitcoin to pay for goods or items purchased from online stores. Yes, cryptocurrency has already penetrated the e-commerce industry.\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve seen the gradual adoption of cryptocurrency in e-commerce. Online businesses have started accepting digital currencies as a form of payment. Cryptocurrency offers e-commerce merchants some benefits, from ease to convenience to security. However, there is more to these advantages than meets the eye.\n\nLearn more about e-commerce cryptocurrency in the next section.\n\nCryptocurrency for consumer payments\n\nHere\u2019s how consumers can use crypto for e-commerce transactions:\n\nPayments via personal wallets: E-commerce businesses accept crypto directly without any intermediaries. They allow consumers to have digital wallets with virtual assets in them. Then, consumers can use their crypto money to purchase products online.\n\nPayments via third parties: Online businesses use third-party services (BitPay and Coinbase) for crypto transactions. Consumers use their crypto money to buy products through these payment gateways.\n\nCompanies using e-commerce crypto:\n\nBelow are some companies that have started using e-commerce cryptocurrencies:\n\nStarbucks employs Bakkt, allowing its members to convert crypto into cash using their SB cards.\n\nMicrosoft accepts bitcoin payments for purchasing Windows games, movies, and app licenses.\n\nLush accepts bitcoin payments for online purchases, given its partnership with Bitpay.com.\n\nPotential benefits and drawbacks of e-commerce cryptocurrency\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the potential benefits and drawbacks of using e-commerce crypto. To weigh the pros and cons, consider the following:\n\nPros:\n\nMarket Growth: Individuals and businesses can no longer ignore crypto\u2019s market growth. E-commerce businesses should capitalize on crypto\u2019s expansion as early as now. Who knows? It might be the future money.\n\nFast Transactions: E-commerce crypto transactions go through and get immediately posted. E-commerce merchants don\u2019t need to wait for bank processing. They don\u2019t need to seek approval from a central authority. That can provide you with an immediate return on investment (ROI).\n\nZero-to-minimal Fees: Payments via digital wallets don\u2019t incur a transaction fee. But if it\u2019s payment via a third party, there will be a minimal charge. Consumers will spend less when using e-commerce crypto for purchasing.\n\nImproved UX: Offering consumers crypto as a payment option improves the user experience. Such payment flexibility will reduce your cart abandonment rate. It will go as far as increasing your sales conversion.\n\nEnhanced Security: Cryptocurrency is encrypted, operating in blockchain technology. For this reason, consumers can expect full security. Their digital assets cannot get counterfeited at all.\n\nCons:\n\nVolatile Pricing: Cryptocurrency is negatively known for its volatility. Its market value is unpredictable and can significantly go up and down. Why is this so? No official fiat currency backs crypto.\n\nCash Flow Problems: The public doesn\u2019t fully recognize cryptocurrency as having real value. E-commerce merchants accepting crypto as consumer payments may keep them as digital assets, which can make up your free cash flow. However, the problem starts when they need to use the money for business expenditures almost immediately.\n\nTrust Issues: The global media puts crypto, albeit its market growth, in a negative light. That\u2019s why e-commerce merchants are hesitant to allow this payment method. And so are the consumers, who are wary of using this digital currency.\n\nSustainability Issues: Cryptocurrency mining requires massive energy for mining crypto coins. Per CNBC, the energy use for crypto mining is so high. It consumes more electricity than the Netherlands\u2019 yearly consumption. Thus, this has negative repercussions on the global quest for sustainability.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe use of cryptocurrency has become increasingly popular worldwide, which applies to the e-commerce industry.\n\nAs an online business owner, consider offering crypto as one of your payment options. But as a consumer, consider using this virtual currency for your online purchase. However, understand what it is and how it works. More importantly, weigh the pros and cons discussed above.\n\nWith these in mind, you\u2019ll have an informed decision. Capitalize on e-commerce cryptocurrency. It might be the future of money."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens lost their mojo on Thursday as the top crypto tokens posted big cuts. The inflation data from the UK dented the market sentiments, coupled with massive sell order on Binance. Macroeconomic data is likely to remain a key trigger for the markets.\n\n\n\nBitcoin dropped as much as 5 per cent to slip sharply below the $29,000 mark in the last 24 hours. Its largest peer, Ethereum, dropped more than 7 per cent and breached below the $1,950 level. Pain in the altcoins, however, was severe.\n\n\n\nBitcoin experienced a decline to below the $29,000 level following the release of UK inflation figures that exceeded expectations, indicating a 10.1 per cent increase in the 12-month period. This drop led BTC to its lowest point since April 10, with the next significant support level at $28,500, said Edul Patel, CEO and Co-Founder at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Ethereum saw a 7 per cent decrease over the same period, trading at the $1,900 level. The market responds with a typical reaction to unexpected events, prompting investors to move away from riskier assets. So, it might take some time for investors and traders to assess the potential impact of the inflation data and recover from the incident,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll of the top crypto tokens were trading with big cuts on Thursday. Even the stablecoins were trading in red. Litecoin plunged 11 per cent, whereas Avalanche tanked 10 per cent. Solana was down 8 per cent, while Polygon and Polkadot tumbled 7 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading steeply lower, around $1.21 trillion, dropping more than 5 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes soared about 40 per cent to $63.51 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View from WazirX Trade Desk\n\nBeta Finance(BETA) is a decentralized financial platform built on Ethereum that enables users to borrow, lend, and short various crypto assets without requiring permission. It offers a convenient and scalable money market that automatically and freely lists tokens, allowing users to short them as well.\n\nBETA had been on a steady decline since August last year. On the daily timeframe the chart has broken above the descending trendline. We could expect the momentum to continue for a few more days. The next resistance is expected at $0.115 and the next support is expected at $0.065 levels"

        "title": "Crypto Price Predictions 2023: Why Bitcoin Price pump to $60k, Ethereum Price will surge past $6k, and Love Hate Inu ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "We are currently experiencing market conditions we have not seen since we first started to come out of the pandemic. 2023 has truly been a blessing for the market after it experienced one of its worst periods ever at the back end of 2022.\n\nThe new year began with a bull run and it has been a case of start as you mean to go on for the market as a whole. Sure there have been some blips along the way but generally things have been pointing upward. The emergence of presales as successful as Love Hate Inu (LHINU) and the recovery of traditional giants Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) shows how the growth is really market-wide and indicates this is not a flash in the pan thing and should continue through Q2 and beyond.\n\nThere was a lot of caution preached after the first bull run of the year that it likely wasn\u2019t sustainable and even as Bitcoin and Ethereum continued to grow after the run on traditional banks some experts were still saying the growth would slow due to interest rate hikes. Well, that hasn\u2019t been the case and even though news coming from the feds suggests rates will still not be slashed by Q3 there is still positive buzz around the market.\n\n>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nWhy BTC and ETH will not stop pumping\n\nNow even the most skeptical of analysts are starting to change their tone. There has been too much growth market-wide to dismiss it as anything other than real. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are the market\u2019s two biggest currencies so their price movement tends to be mirrored by the market as a whole. It is their continued positive movement that has won over the doubters.\n\nIn the chart above we can see Bitcoin\u2019s growth over the last 3 months. This is the reason many believe it can return to the heights of 2021 and finally break $60,000 again. It has already seen growth of over 55% since the start of the year and that\u2019s even after the disappointment of interest not being slashed as they were predicted to be at the start of the year.\n\nSo imagine what will happen to the price once these rates finally slow and are cut? The price will likely go through the roof! This is on top of the news that has been consistently flowing in from around the world about countries softening their views of Bitcoin and many taking steps toward hiring regulators so as to introduce it to their markets in the future.\n\nWhen we take all the above into consideration and the fact that eventually, inflation rates will have to stop, we think $60,000 might even be a modest marker for Bitcoin in the next few years.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has been experiencing growth due to events happening within the ecosystem. On April 12th the long-awaited Shanghai upgrade took place. This was the first time ETH holders could finally withdraw the native currency and any rewards they had incurred.\n\nSome experts feared this would plummet the price of ETH due to a mass withdrawal of funds but it looks like it has mostly been the rewards that have been withdrawn. This of course strengthens Ethereum\u2019s position as clearly, their holders believe in the project long-term.\n\nJust looking at the chart above we can see nearly 75% growth in just the last 3 months alone. Just like with Bitcoin, the $6k barrier actually feels like it will be broken by Ethereum a lot sooner than many would have thought a little while ago.\n\nWhile these traditional giants look set to continue to pump the presale of Love Hate Inu (LHINU) is gathering a similar amount of attention, let\u2019s see why!\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nLove Hate Inu- Meme coin set to break $2 once launched\n\nIt is nearly unheard of that a presale coin would be in the news as much as coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin, but Love Hate Inu (LHINU) is no ordinary coin and it represents the most exciting project on the market right now.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nThe presale is still not even two months old and already it has raised over $4.5 million. Why is this the best investment opportunity right now? Well, firstly it\u2019s the very first meme coin/V2E platform meaning it will have the virality of a meme coin and the utility of a staking coin. We think that once launched it will easily pump to $2 and beyond.\n\nOne look at the site now and you will see why experts and influencers can\u2019t dedicate enough words to this crypto. For example, it is showing its future users the kind of polls they will be able to vote on, they have a \u2018do you love or hate celebrity x\u2019 poll currently to view. Each celebrity is represented by a hilarious angel and devil meme version of themselves.\n\n>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nThis of course will draw in the influencers but the experts have been drawn in by the very comprehensive white paper. Love Hate Inu is really thinking about the future and security of their project. 90 percent of the total coin allocation will be sold at presale to prevent a dodgy rug pull from happening once the coin goes to its CEX listings, this also ensures only the real LHINU lovers will have a say in any future company decisions.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nIf you weren\u2019t sold on Love Hate Inu being the best investment opportunity on the market they also put their user\u2019s experience to the forefront. A stake-2-vote system will be implemented that requires users to stake LHINU for 30 days before they can vote. This in turn ensures a voter\u2019s anonymity which will also be useful in the discussion platform that will be available under polls.\n\nThe more you stake the more control you will have over these polls. Also, in the future, users will be able to suggest and run their own polls. This is to harvest a community vibe and the users will need to put forward their own LHINU to run the poll. There can then be a lively discussion about what polls should go on the site, giving a lot of the power to the users.\n\nThe price of LHINU once launched will be $0.000145 so predicting a growth spurt to $2 is ambitious. However, the market has not seen a meem coin with its capabilities before so we think it will blow the competition out of the market and soar past $2 in the future.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now!<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nIt seems to be good news all around for the crypto market, we have incredibly successful presales like Love Hate Inu ongoing, and traditional giants Bitcoin and Ethereum look set to reach previous highs. Of all 3 Love Hate Inu is by far the best investment opportunity, its room to grow is far bigger than the other two and it can be bought at a rock bottom price meaning investors can stockpile it before it pumps.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Tesla\u2019s Q1 report showed that the company still held around 11,950 BTC as of 19 April\n\nThe company did not register any BTC gains over the past three months in its report\n\nTesla \u2013 the American electric car manufacturing giant \u2013 released its much-awaited first-quarter report for 2023 on 19 April. The car manufacturer\u2019s accounting sheets showed that the company did not make any changes in its Bitcoin [BTC] holdings.\n\nThis was in comparison to the last Q4 report of 2022.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nTesla\u2019s Bitcoin Bet\n\nThis aforementioned statement proved that Tesla neither bought more coins nor sold existing ones. Notably, this is the third consecutive quarter the firm held the same stance on its BTC holdings.\n\nThe car manufacturer initially entered the crypto market in February 2021. The firm purchased BTC worth $1.2 billion but sold 75% of this investment in July 2022. Moreover, the sale took place right when the king coin had started losing its value. Notably, the sale added around $936 million to the firm\u2019s accounting books in cash reserves.\n\nThe electric vehicle manufacturer held around 11,950 BTC at press time, which was worth over $349 million. Interestingly, Tesla\u2019s report also showed that the value of held BTC remained the same as the previous quarter. The e-car manufacturer\u2019s Q4 2022 report placed its BTC asset value at $184 million. This same number was projected for this quarter as well despite a surge in the coin\u2019s price.\n\nFurthermore, BTC\u2019s price reached a high of $23,954 in January 2023, while it reached a peak of $29,380 in the month of March 2023. Tesla did not increase its BTC valuation because of accounting rules. The electric vehicle manufacturer classifies its BTC holdings as an intangible assets-goodwill. This means that the company will register quarterly impairment analysis for losses but the gains will be registered only if it is sold.\n\nNotably, Tesla had a more pro-Bitcoin stance before the 2022 bear market. The company, spearheaded by Elon Musk, was set to add BTC as an option for payments for purchases. However, the plan was aborted with Musk citing environmental concerns surrounding the mining of the largest digital currency in the market.\n\nSubsequently, he also claimed that BTC was not \u201ca good substitute for transactional currency,\u201d while voicing support for Dogecoin [DOGE]."

        "content": "Chipmaker Intel has announced that it will be discontinuing the manufacturing of its \u2018Blockscale\u2019 Bitcoin mining chip series. These chips, which were specifically created for mining purposes, were introduced to the market around a year ago. Moreover, the company's final product shipment is scheduled to take place no later than April 20, 2024.\n\nIntel has announced that it will stop taking orders for its Blockscale series by October 20 of this year, with shipping expected to end by April 20 of next year.\n\n\"As we prioritise our investments in IDM 2.0, we have end-of-life the Intel Blockscale 1000 Series ASIC while we continue to support our Blockscale customers,\" a company spokesperson said, reported by Tom\u2019s Hardware.\n\nIntel's latest move, IDM 2.0, involves the outsourcing of its chip-making to external customers, while simultaneously increasing its production of smaller and faster chips.\n\nIntel's foray into the world of crypto mining chips began with the Bonanza Mine codename for its R&D chips, which never made it to the commercial market. However, the tech firm later cleared its intentions to enter the blockchain market and subsequently unveiled a second-generation model called 'Blockscale'. This new offering was made available exclusively to a select group of large-scale mining companies, including BLOCK, GRIID Infrastructure, and Argo Blockchain, among others.\n\nAccording to the report, several major industrial mining companies have secured significant long-term contracts for a reliable supply of Blockscale ASICs. This move is seen as a strategic measure to avoid the volatility associated with Chinese manufacturers who have been known to engage in pricing manipulations based on Bitcoin valuations. These manufacturers have also been subject to tariffs, supply disruptions, and shortages, which have resulted in increased logistics and shipping costs from China.\n\nHowever, Intel remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency industry and said, they will continue to \u201cmonitor market opportunities in the cryptocurrency space.\u201d\n\nThe recent cryptocurrency market downturn has harmed several chip companies, including Nvidia Corp, and the decision to discontinue mining operations from Intel is a direct response to that.\n\nLeading cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, are transitioning towards a Proof of Stake (POS) mechanism, which discourages mining. In addition to a significant shift in point-of-sale technology, the cryptocurrency markets are currently grappling with a high degree of uncertainty, with many digital currencies hitting their lowest values in the previous year."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the most expensive cryptocurrency to ever exist, could soon become a car payment option in India. Anand Mahindra, the chairperson of Mahindra and Mahindra, has hinted in a tweet at a future where the crypto asset could come in handy to purchase a car from the company. An Indian business tycoon, Mahindra runs one of India's largest automotive manufacturing corporation that boasts a valuation of $18.3 billion (roughly Rs. 1,50,353 crore).\n\nMahindra, 67, is an avid Twitter user and often updates his timeline with amusing videos, social commentary, and his personal experiences with life.\n\nReplying to a follower who asked if a Mahindra car could be purchased via Bitcoin payment, the company chief said, \u201cNot yet. But maybe bit by bit in the future,\u201d.\n\nNot yet. But maybe bit by bit in the future.. https://t.co/pQS0ZQ52Qf \u2014 anand mahindra (@anandmahindra) April 20, 2023\n\nUp until now, no automobile brand accepts payments in cryptocurrencies in India.\n\nThe government of India is currently working to create a legal framework around crypto activities, in order to mitigate financial and national security risks that the sector could usher in along with its expansion.\n\nCapable of processing instant cross border transfers of hefty payments, cryptocurrencies are unregulated and keep transactions largely untraceable. The misuse of crypto assets by miscreants could increase cases of money laundering and terror financing among others.\n\nWhile the purchase and trading of cryptocurrencies is permitted and taxable in India, no cryptocurrency is used as a payment option alongside the INR currency.\n\nFor Mahindra, however, hinting at taking an experimentative approach towards crypto payments does not come as quite the surprise.\n\nIn March 2022, Mahindra and Mahindra marked its entry into the non-fungible token (NFT) space with the release of its first set of digital collectables, joining the likes of MG Motor India in the automotive space.\n\nWhile Indian automakers are keeping a restrictive approach towards crypto, payments in cryptocurrencies have become part of the financial systems of other nations like El Salvador and the US.\n\nIn the first five months of 2021, Elon Musk's Tesla was actually allowing Bitcoin payments for select products and services. Musk had also discussed about opening payments in DOGE for the EV at the time.\n\nGaana, JioSaavn, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts,\n\nApple is opening its first stores in India, one in Mumbai and the other in Delhi.

        "content": "SINGAPORE \u2013 Bitcoin appears to be back in favour with investors after the popular cryptocurrency pushed past US$30,000 last week \u2013 the first time it has hit that level since June 10, 2022.\n\nThe largest digital currency by market capitalisation has risen by more than 70 per cent since January, outstripping an 8 per cent climb in global stocks, noted Bloomberg.\n\nThere has been a marked turnaround after a series of high-profile bankruptcies in the sector sent Bitcoin\u2019s price tumbling from a peak of around US$68,000 in November 2021 to just over US$15,000 in November 2022.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rebound also follows 2023\u2019s failure of Swiss bank Credit Suisse and three United States banks, two that did business extensively with the crypto sector.\n\nThe events have revived the case for crypto as an alternative, decentralised banking system unhampered by financial intermediaries like banks. They are also testing the US Federal Reserve\u2019s resolve to keep interest rates high.\n\nThe Fed started hiking rates to tame inflation in 2022, a move that triggered an outflow of cash from risky assets like crypto, but has since hurt parts of the economy.\n\nAny U-turn could once again raise crypto\u2019s appeal as an alternative investment class.\n\nDBS chief economist Taimur Baig said: \u201cWe associate this year\u2019s rebound in cryptocurrencies with expectations of a peak in the global monetary policy cycle and as an expression of risk diversification by investors.\u201d\n\nInterest in crypto investing remains high in Singapore despite a general lack of understanding about the sector, said consultancy CT Group.\n\nIts online poll of 1,057 Singaporeans in March showed that about 60 per cent are likely to buy crypto in the next few years, believing it can help them get ahead. But nearly 50 per cent said they were not confident in explaining what crypto is to others, revealing a poor understanding of the product.\n\nIf crypto is on your radar, here\u2019s what to know before hopping on board."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency investors are always looking for new opportunities to invest in digital currency. With the recent rise in the popularity of presale platforms, it\u2019s important to stay up to date on market trends. In this article, we\u2019ll closely analyze the April 2023 forecast for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the new presale coin Dogetti (DETI) and explore the key factors shaping the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin Climbing Back Bit By Bit\n\nBitcoin (BTC), as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has been a strong performer so far in 2023, with prices up 68.4% year-to-date. There are several factors that contribute to this, including increased institutional adoption and a shift in Federal Reserve policy, which has helped to boost investor confidence in the digital currency.\n\nLooking at the positive price performance in March, we can see the potential for a bullish pattern to continue in April. Bitcoin reached $29,000 briefly in late March, but dipped back down to $28,477 at the end of the month, still clocking in a 19.2% monthly gain.\n\nEthereal Economics: The Rising Value of Ethereum\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has also seen gains in 2023, with prices up 49.2% year-to-date. One key factor driving this growth is the rise of Web3, the next generation of the internet, using decentralisation as a key part of the network. Web3 has the potential to revolutionise the way we use the internet, and Ethereum\u2019s position as a key player in this space makes it an attractive investment opportunity for those interested in the future of digital technology.\n\nEthereum also is looking to perform strongly in April, as Ethereum shot up by 9.7% over the month of March, and finished strongly at a price of $1829.\n\nDogetti: The Rise of a New Meme Coin Kingpin\n\nDogetti (DETI) is a new presale coin that is set to launch in just two months and is attracting a lot of attention from many cryptocurrency investors. The coin\u2019s purpose is to create a strong community where holders are regularly rewarded thanks to a 2% reflection protocol, which means that 2% of every transaction is distributed to all wallets.\n\nDogetti also has a unique feature in the form of DogettiSwap, a decentralised exchange built on the Ethereum blockchain where users can trade ERC20 tokens with a 6% tax fee, which is broken down into 2% redistributed to all wallets, 2% to a charity wallet, and 2% for liquidity.\n\nPredicting the future price of any asset is a daunting task, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. Bitcoin and Ethereum have all experienced significant price fluctuations in the past. These digital assets have proven their potential to disrupt traditional finance and create new opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs.\n\nOverall, the April 2023 cryptocurrency market forecast looks promising for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogetti, with each offering unique opportunities for investors.\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Love it or hate it, cryptocurrency is becoming more mainstream. Crypto ETFs are one option to investigate if you want to add some crypto exposure to your investment portfolio.\n\nWhat are crypto ETFs?\n\nThey are a type of exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in cryptocurrencies or companies operating in the crypto sector. Funds that invest directly in cryptocurrencies may invest exclusively in just one token (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) or buy a basket of digital tokens instead.\n\nCrypto ETFs can provide investors a low-cost way to gain exposure to cryptos and the crypto industry. And outsourcing investment decision-making to a fund manager massively reduces the time investors need to devote to researching cryptos.\n\nThis gives ETFs a clear advantage over direct crypto investment, especially considering how opaque and volatile the crypto space can be.\n\nBut this doesn't mean crypto ETFs don't also come with some significant risks that you need to be aware of. So, before getting on with our discussion of ASX crypto ETFs, let's cover off some basics.\n\nSo, what exactly are cryptocurrencies?\n\nCryptocurrencies are a type of digital asset. Unlike fiat currencies (such as the Australian or United States dollars), central banks do not issue cryptos. Instead, they are created via blockchain technology through a process called mining. You can check out our article on cryptocurrencies if you want to get into the weeds of blockchain technology.\n\nOnce created, we can trade cryptos just like other assets. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency created, and it remains the most valuable. As people have found more applications for blockchain technology, the number of different cryptos has rapidly increased. However, after peaking at more than 10,000 listed cryptocurrencies in February 2022, that number had fallen to around 8600 by February 2023.1\n\nAnd how about ETFs?\n\nETFs are a type of investment vehicle similar to a mutual fund. However, unlike a mutual fund, an ETF trades on the stock market just like ordinary shares.\n\nETF managers pool together money from many investors and then use that money to make investments according to a particular fund mandate or strategy. Many ETFs are passively managed funds. They might replicate the returns of an index, such as the S&P/ASX 200 (ASX: XJO), a market sector (like tech or healthcare), or even a commodity (gold or oil).\n\nHow to invest in ETFs in Australia\n\nPlenty of ETFs trade on the Australian Securities Exchange, pursuing different investment strategies. They provide a low-cost way to diversify your investments across multiple shares and asset classes.\n\nYou can invest in a portfolio of international technology shares, high-dividend ASX stocks, or even a basket of different commodities in a single trade.\n\nThe best thing about ETFs is you can buy and sell units in the fund just as you would ordinary shares. Simply lodge a trade with your preferred broker.\n\nInvesting in international funds\n\nThere are two ways to gain international exposure through ETF investing. One is to buy units in an ETF trading on the ASX that already invests in international shares. For example, the iShares Global 100 ETF AUD (ASX: IOO) offers exposure to the world's top 100 companies, ranked by market capitalisation.\n\nThe second way is to invest directly in ETFs that trade on overseas stock exchanges. More and more brokers (particularly new digital broker start-ups like Stake) allow you to invest in overseas stock markets at relatively low costs. This offers up a whole new universe of ETFs to invest in \u2013 many of which pursue different investment strategies to those listed on the ASX.\n\nExtra choice is particularly attractive for investors seeking crypto exposure, given the limited range of Australian crypto ETFs.\n\nThe easiest overseas share markets for Australians to invest in are usually those located in the United States. Thousands of ETFs are trading on US equities markets like the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange, many of which provide crypto exposure.\n\nFor example, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NASDAQ: BTF) aims to track the price of Bitcoin by investing in Bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nWhy invest in crypto ETFs?\n\nMany cryptocurrencies have a finite supply written into their digital code. Some, like Bitcoin, become increasingly difficult to mine over time until, eventually, their supply will run out.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts argue that this inbuilt scarcity gives crypto an inherent value, much like precious metals. In fact, Bitcoin's greatest supporters believe the token could one day become a new 'digital gold' \u2013 a safe haven asset that investors can turn to as a store of value in troubled economic times.\n\nSome investors are also just naturally drawn to the libertarian ideals of crypto. Unlike fiat currencies, central banks can't control the supply of cryptocurrencies. They exist beyond the reach of government regulations and traditional monetary policy. This can make crypto pretty alluring to those with a rebellious spirit.\n\nCrypto's anti-establishment streak comes from the underlying blockchain technology. Blockchain's decentralised structure has the potential to utterly transform many industries \u2013 particularly banking and financial services \u2013 by removing the need for trusted intermediaries. Investing in crypto is the best way to gain exposure to this potentially revolutionary tech.\n\nAs we've already mentioned, a cryptocurrency ETF can be a low-hassle, low-cost way to gain exposure to the crypto industry. Many crypto ETFs provide broad exposure to cryptocurrencies and companies involved in the crypto space. Accessing this sort of diversification cheaply also reduces some risks in investing in crypto.\n\nTop options\n\nThe only option currently available to Australian investors who want to invest in crypto ETFs on the ASX is the BetaShares Crypto Innovators ETF (ASX: CRYP), which invests in companies operating in the crypto space rather than cryptocurrencies themselves.\n\nYou will have to look overseas if you want an ETF that tracks the prices of actual cryptocurrencies. There are a few funds trading on stock exchanges in the US that offer more direct exposure to cryptos themselves.\n\nName Description Betashares Crypto Innovators ETF\n\n\n\n(ASX: CRYP) The only crypto fund currently listed on the ASX ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF\n\n\n\n(NYSEARCA: BITO) The world's biggest crypto ETF, investing in Bitcoin futures contracts Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Units\n\n\n\n(OTC: BITW) A fund tracking an index of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies\n\n\n\nby market capitalisation\n\nBetaShares Crypto Innovators\n\nThe BetaShares Crypto Innovators fund invests in the companies that build crypto mining equipment, like high-powered computer hardware, as well as other companies that support the crypto industry. The fund is well diversified, with holdings in up to 50 crypto companies.\n\nThe fund is currently the best and only option for ASX investors seeking crypto exposure. Its largest holdings include Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: MARA) and Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: RIOT), crypto mining companies, and Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: COIN), the operator of one of the most popular crypto trading platforms.\n\nProShares Bitcoin Strategy\n\nWith well over US$500 million in net assets, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy claims to be the world's largest and most actively traded Bitcoin ETF. However, it doesn't invest directly in cryptocurrency. Instead, the fund uses futures contracts to try and replicate the price performance of Bitcoin.\n\nIt is still a good option for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure. The fund has actually managed to track the price of Bitcoin quite closely since its inception back in October 2021. Unfortunately, the price of Bitcoin has declined by more than 60% in that timeframe.\n\nBitwise 10 Crypto Index Units\n\nThe Bitwise fund tracks an index of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies, as measured by their market capitalisations. Units in the fund can be bought and sold over the counter in the US.\n\nAs the values of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate rapidly, the fund is rebalanced monthly. This active management comes at a substantial cost, with annual fees totalling 2.5%, or $25 for every $1,000 invested. This can quickly eat into your potential returns.\n\nEven so, Bitwise is probably the best crypto ETF for investors seeking exposure to the crypto market. Roughly 60% of the fund's holdings are in Bitcoin, 30% are in Ethereum, and the remaining 10% are split between other altcoins.\n\nPros and cons of investing in crypto ETFs\n\nWe have already discussed some of the benefits of investing in crypto.\n\nCrypto acolytes claim that the scarcity of some digital tokens gives them an inherent value. If this proves true, it could make some cryptocurrencies \u2013 particularly Bitcoin \u2013 viable alternatives to traditional safe-haven assets. It may even make crypto an inflation hedge.\n\nThe blockchain technology that makes crypto possible also has the potential to revolutionise many industries. Companies continue to experiment with blockchains and are continually coming up with new and exciting applications for the technology. Of course, not all of these ventures will succeed, but those that do could become genuine game changers.\n\nInvestors should always approach crypto investments cautiously. The crypto markets are volatile and incredibly risky. Just last year, FTX \u2013 at the time the world's largest crypto exchange \u2013 collapsed amid allegations of fraud. And that's just one of many frauds and thefts that have plagued the crypto industry in its short history.\n\nThis is enough to turn some investors off crypto for good. In fact, crypto's greatest detractors will tell you it's all a giant Ponzi scheme. That sooner or later, the world will realise that the emperor has no clothes and these digital tokens are worthless.\n\nGiven the risks, do plenty of research before investing in crypto, even through a large, diversified ETF. And never invest any money you can't afford to lose.\n\nHow have global events impacted crypto markets?\n\nThe collapse of the FTX exchange rattled crypto markets, with billions wiped off the market caps of some of the leading cryptocurrencies. However, markets had already been in decline before the FTX debacle.\n\nRunaway inflation, rising interest rates, and fears of a recession caused investors to dump riskier assets. Bitcoin has yet to live up to its promise as a digital alternative to gold and other safe-haven assets.\n\nMarkets have stabilised more recently, but the damage to the crypto industry from the collapse of FTX could be long-lasting. It reminded investors of the risks of putting money into an unregulated industry.\n\nAre crypto ETFs right for you?\n\nCrypto ETFs can be an easy, low-cost way for everyday investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies and the crypto industry. This may particularly suit a growth investor with a fondness for tech shares, as it can provide exposure to companies building new blockchain applications.\n\nAlthough the potential payoff could be enormous, investing in crypto is still incredibly risky, as the FTX collapse shows. This means investing in crypto won't suit all investors.\n\nSo, before adding crypto ETFs to your portfolio, consider your financial situation carefully. It's vital to ensure crypto investing aligns with your personal investment goals and risk appetite."

        "content": "After crossing the psychological threshold at $30,000 earlier in April, Bitcoin (BTC) is back to trading below this key level once again, leaving investors and financial experts trying to gauge the movements of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) by the end of the year.\n\nIndeed, a panel of 32 financial technology and cryptocurrency specialists has projected that the price of Bitcoin would grow during 2023, peaking at $42,225 before finally ending the year at $35,459, according to the results of a poll carried out by the investment platform Finder and shared with Finbold on April 19.\n\nBitcoin year-end price predictions for 2023, 2025, and 2030. Source: Finder\n\nWhat do the experts say?\n\nAs a bullish case for Bitcoin, GroveToken COO Carlo Di Clemente used the fact that having lost trust in banks, people have started to look at the maiden crypto asset as a practical alternative to traditional banking, which \u201chas had a positive effect on Bitcoin adoption in 2023.\u201d\n\nAs he added:\n\n\u201cBitcoin could also continue to experience significant price appreciation over the next decade as more institutional investors and corporations adopt [an] increasing mainstream acceptance [of] Bitcoin as a form of payment.\u201d\n\nHis views are shared by Tommy Honan, head of commercial operations at Swyftx, who stressed Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cmany sought-after properties for institutional and retail investors alike,\u201d as well as its finite supply, which \u201ccould lead to an increase in price as supply shock is felt.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, John Hawkins, senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, isn\u2019t optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, arguing that:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is a speculative bubble, which I expect to burst. (\u2026) Although predicting when is very hard. It has failed as a payment instrument or currency, failed as an inflation hedge or store of value, and failed as a diversification asset.\u201d\n\nIs it time to buy Bitcoin now?\n\nThat said, 52% of Finder\u2019s panel believe that now is a good time to buy Bitcoin, whereas 32% suggest holding. On the opposite side of the spectrum is the 16% of panelists who recommend selling the largest digital asset by market capitalization.\n\nPanel\u2019s opinions on buying, selling, or holding BTC. Source: Finder\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that more than half of panelists believe that President Joe Biden\u2019s plan to close the \u2018wash trading\u2019 loophole for digital assets would create a certain amount of negative effect on Bitcoin.\n\nSpecifically, 22% have stated it will have a \u201cminimal effect,\u201d another 22% say that it will have a \u201cmoderate effect,\u201d and 19% believe it will have a \u201csignificant effect.\u201d In contrast, 28% of panelists are skeptical that President Biden\u2019s \u2018wash trading\u2019 rule would have any effect on Bitcoin or the broader crypto market.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Bitcoin is currently changing hands at the price of $29,281, recording a decline of 2.39% on the day, as well as decreasing 3.24% over the last week, while still retaining the 3.88% gains it has accumulated over the past month, according to the data retrieved on April 19.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nWhether the general consensus among the experts on the BTC price in 2023 can materialize will largely depend on the sentiment in the wider cryptocurrency sector and beyond, particularly influenced by the regulatory onslaught that is currently underway.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
