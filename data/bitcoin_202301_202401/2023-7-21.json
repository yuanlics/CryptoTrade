        "content": "From the very beginning, observers speculated BITO and other futures-based ETFs would significantly underperform bitcoin due to costs associated with rolling over, or selling expiring futures contracts and buying the next set. Usually, longer-dated futures contracts trade at a premium to those closer to expiry, a condition known as contango. The contango tends to steepen during bull runs, and the steeper the contango, the higher the costs, and the so-called contango bleed."

        "content": "The nature of the charge or charges in the information was not made public. It is common for informations to have fewer charges than those originally lodged against defendants, or to have different ones.\n\nAnother docket entry shows that Lichtenstein and the aspiring rapper Morgan have been ordered to appear in court on Aug. 3 for separate arraignments and plea hearings on the information.\n\nAn information is a type of charging document that federal prosecutors typically use when defendants have agreed to plead guilty.\n\nThe couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Rhiannon Morgan, have been newly charged in the case with a document known as an information, according to a new Washington, D.C., federal court docket entry Friday.\n\nThe New York couple charged with trying to launder $4.5 billion in bitcoin stolen in a 2016 hack of Bitfinex appear set to plead guilty in the case.\n\nJudge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly on Friday ordered prosecutors and defense lawyers to provide plea paperwork to her by Thursday, the docket shows.\n\nThat paperwork is to include \"charged offense(s) and statutory provision; charge(s) in plea and statutory provision; elements of the offense; copy of the plea agreement; penalties; and [federal sentencing] guideline calculations.\"\n\nThe couple was originally charged in a criminal complaint when they were arrested in February 2022, and had pleaded not guilty to the charges listed in that document \u2013 money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\nMorgan, known as \"Razzlekhan,\" is free on a $3 million bond. Lichtenstein, whose nickname is \"Dutch,\" has been held in jail since February 2022 without bond after a judge ruled that the Russian emigre was a flight risk.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, which is prosecuting the couple, declined to comment. Their defense lawyers didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from CNBC.\n\nProsecutors had said weeks after the couple's arrests that they were in plea negotiations with them.\n\nThe couple's case has been repeatedly continued since their arrests. Until Friday's new docket entries, they had been scheduled to appear at a status hearing on Monday. That hearing was vacated as a result of the new charging document being filed.\n\nLichtenstein, 34, and the 32-year-old Morgan are accused of trying to launder the proceeds of 119,754 bitcoin that were stolen from Bitfinex's platform in August 2016. The couple was not charged in the hack of the Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nAt the time of their arrests, the Department of Justice said officials had been able to seize more than 94,000 bitcoin involved in the hack, which at that time of the seizure was worth about $3.6 billion. That was the largest financial seizure in DOJ history.\n\nThe bitcoin stolen in the hack was worth just $70 million at the time of the theft, but soared in value in the following years.\n\n\"Over the last five years, approximately 25,000 of those stolen bitcoin were transferred out of Lichtenstein's wallet via a complicated money laundering process that ended with some of the stolen funds being deposited into financial accounts controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan,\" the DOJ said at the time of their arrests.\n\nNetflix in early 2022 announced it had commissioned a series on the couple."

        "content": "Last month, BlackRock Inc., the world\u2019s biggest money manager, asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund \u2014 a fund that would invest in the digital currency directly rather than through futures markets. BlackRock joins tens of other smaller ETF providers with the same request, so far without success. But with BlackRock\u2019s heft behind growing demands for a spot Bitcoin fund, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the SEC relents.\n\nAnd it should. A spot ETF would allow investors to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin more easily, cheaply and securely than they can today. In a crypto industry awash with scams, regulatory oversight would also give investors and money managers confidence that they\u2019re buying a bona fide financial product, particularly if it has BlackRock\u2019s name on it."

        "title": "Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin falls below US$30,000 as institutional interest in ETFs fails to lift markets - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell 4.66% from July 14 to July 21 to US$29,755 at 7:35 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading under the US$30,000 mark for most of the week. Ether lost 5.38% over the week to US$1,885.\n\nIn continued institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accepted eight applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs so far, with the first from BlackRock on July 13 and the second from asset manager Valkyrie on Monday.\n\n\u201cInstitutional interest remains a driving force behind Bitcoin\u2019s stability, as large corporations and financial institutions continue to invest in Bitcoin, while the SEC accepts more Bitcoin ETF filings for review,\u201d Lucas Kiely, chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cETFs are set to open up the Bitcoin market, and potentially crypto markets in general, to a large pool of global investors who until this point have not considered buying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s grown clearer that governments are inclined to regulate rather than ban cryptocurrencies, and the Ripple ruling has provided a sense of relief in the US crypto industry.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s move to accept the first eight Bitcoin ETF filings for review inspired confidence in other top asset managers, Aziz Kenjaev, financial analyst and director of business development at cross-chain liquidity protocol Entangle, told Forkast,\n\n\u201cInvestors and the crypto-community called this a beginning of a new bullish cycle. The US$30,000 is Bitcoin\u2019s major support, therefore keeping Bitcoin above this level plays a key role for the bullish continuation of Bitcoin. It\u2019s also a psychological level, whereas dropping below this level would trigger a panic sale in the market,\u201d wrote Kenjaev, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nIn Europe, French bank Societe Generale on Tuesday obtained a crypto service license in the country that allowed its crypto unit, Forge, to offer crypto sales, custody and trading services.\n\nBitcoin and crypto prices have been more correlated to macroeconomic conditions in 2023, wrote digital asset manager Grayscale Investments in a Friday report.\n\n\u201cSince January, Bitcoin has appreciated more than can be explained by the rally in tech stocks and fall in the US dollar. We think this reflects idiosyncratic positives, including optimism about eventual spot Bitcoin ETF approval, as well as Bitcoin\u2019s surge in March following stress in regional banks,\u201d wrote the report.\n\n\u201cAlthough crypto has healed significantly since late 2022, valuations are now more closely tied to broader macro trends, and more Fed tightening could be a headwind for higher risk assets, including both equities and cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.2 trillion on Friday at 7:35 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 4% from US$1.25 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$578 billion, Bitcoin represented 48.3% of the market while Ether, valued at US$226 billion, accounted for 18.9%.\n\nNotable Movers: MKR, XDC\n\nMaker DAO\u2019s (MKR) governance token was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins, rising 25.83% to US$1,151. The coin started picking up momentum on Friday, hours after crypto intelligence firm Lookonchain shared that a16z deposited 12,864 MKR tokens to Coinbase while CMS Holdings deposited 525 MKR to Binance, presumably selling the coins before the rally.\n\nEnterprise-grade blockchain protocol XDC Network\u2019s (XDC) token was the week\u2019s second-biggest gainer, rising 25.15% to US$0.04187. The coin started picking up momentum yesterday, in anticipation of the protocol\u2019s appearance at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris.\n\nSee related article: USDT\u2019s goal is to be the dollar, not beat it, says Tether CTO\n\nNext week: Fed\u2019s interest rate decision\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on monetary policy is scheduled for next Wednesday. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99.8% chance the Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points at the next meeting. U.S. interest rates are currently at 5% to 5.25%, the highest since 2006.\n\nEntangle\u2019s Kenjaev said that a close above last week\u2019s high of US$31,800 will be needed to boost Bitcoin prices.\n\n\u201cThe four-hour Bitcoin chart below clearly shows key levels to watch within this week. The parallel channel of June 30 signals the bearish continuation of Bitcoin for this week\u2019s end. Although Bitcoin was able to jump back into the parallel channel, it has to close above $30,300 and remain above to continue bullish or at least guard itself from a panic sell,\u201d wrote Kenjaev, referencing the below chart.\n\nSee related article: XRP\u2019s partial victory as Russia inches toward CBDC; Arkham draws flak"

        "content": "Crypto stocks have been on a tear this year, outstripping most major cryptocurrencies.\n\nMajor bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) has clocked 1,140% gains to reach $0.87 per share.\n\nThe Texas-headquartered firm, which filed for bankruptcy last December, hopes to make a comeback. But it has a ways to go to fully repair its once-billion-dollar valuation \u2014 still down 56% over the past year and more than 90% since it went public in 2021.\n\nCipher Mining (CFIR) has also been buoyed by bitcoin\u2019s year-to-date rally, having jumped almost 600%. BTC is up 80% in 2023, even after slipping below $30,000 this week.\n\nTeraWulf (WULF) \u2014 which debuted the US\u2019s first nuclear-powered bitcoin mining facility in May \u2014 and Iris Energy (IREN) are respectively up 384% and 466%.\n\nExcluding Core Scientific, a trader who placed equal bets across top bitcoin mining stocks at the start of the year would be up nearly 250%.\n\nInvestments into the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap, meanwhile, would have netted the same individual an average of around 49% over the same period.\n\nEther (ETH) is up 58% and XRP has popped 130%, with markets for the latter reacting positively to a mixed court ruling in a long-running legal dispute.\n\nCoinbase (COIN), the only publicly-listed US crypto exchange, has also tripled this year, having started below $35 to $101 today. That converts to one-third gained over the past year, but it\u2019s still 70% down since its April 2021 direct listing.\n\nBitcoin mining stocks are proving more volatile than bitcoin (chart by David Canellis)\n\nThe world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, named Coinbase as the potential bitcoin custodian in its spot ETF filing last month.\n\nAn average of 22 Wall Street analyst forecasts on Coinbase points to a price target of $68.53, suggesting a 32% fall from its current price, per TipRanks.\n\nPerformance in the fintech payments sector, meanwhile, has been mixed. Block (formerly Square), the firm behind bitcoin-forward Cash App, has seen an 18% increase year to date.\n\nPayPal, which allowed users to buy and sell crypto back in October 2020, is down about 2%.\n\nWhile the corporate earnings season has kicked off across the broader economy in the US, publicly-traded crypto companies are not due to report until later this month.\n\nPositive earnings for crypto stocks this month may act as a catalyst for further growth across digital asset markets, although the same can\u2019t be said for lackluster quarterly reports.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Crime in Web3 is shifting away from Bitcoin (BTC) to stablecoins, and Ponzi schemes remain prevalent, according to Elliptic\u2019s former head of technical crypto advisory.\n\nTara Annison shared the latest insights from the murky world of cryptocurrency-related crime during a presentation on the final day of EthCC in Paris, addressing a wide variety of ways digital assets are either facilitating crime or being used to launder funds.\n\nThe presentation drew Web3 crime insights from Elliptic, Chainalysis and TRM Labs, with Annison talking in her capacity as a former employee of Elliptic having recently left the firm.\n\nAccording to Annison, Bitcoin is no longer the cryptocurrency of choice for illicit activities or laundering money. As the cryptocurrency industry has matured, the establishment of decentralized finance protocols, mixing services and stablecoins present new avenues for criminals to explore.\n\nSlide from Annison\u2019s presentation. Source: Tara Annison.\n\nCriminals have shifted toward using dollar-denominated assets, like USD Coin (USDC), with their easy accessibility and ability to be laundered through decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\n\u201cThe criminals use that as a target point. It\u2019s also super easy to launder through DEXs. There\u2019s deep liquidity, really good volume, so that\u2019s pretty worrying.\u201d\n\nAnnison highlighted a potential silver lining from a law enforcement perspective, noting that centralized issuers like Circle could freeze specific USDC tokens before criminals can \u201coff-ramp out of the asset\u201d into fiat through DEXs or centralized exchanges.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is an increased number of accounts with USDC and USDT being blacklisted, and these are frozen funds that the criminals now can\u2019t access.\u201d\n\nPonzi and pyramid schemes remain a feature of the sector, with Annison noting that $7.8 billion was stolen from unwitting victims of these types of scams.\n\nRelated: How the IRS seized $10B worth of crypto using blockchain analytics\n\nCriminals are finding more sophisticated ways to launder funds. Annison said chain swapping and asset swapping are prevalent as criminals try to hide illicit activity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that to the tune of about $4.1 billion. So they hop across using a DEX. They use a coin swap service, they use a mixer, they use a bridge, all basically to try and throw blockchain analytics firms off the trail.\u201d\n\nAnnison said that $1.2 billion stolen from DEXs eventually ends up on centralized exchanges. In comparison with previous years, scams in the sector are down 46%. The reason, according to Annison, is the ongoing bear market, which has inevitably made the sector less appealing for cybercriminals.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re less hyped up, the prices are lower, so it\u2019s not as profitable for criminals. So at least next time we\u2019re in a bear market, do bear in mind that the scams are at least down.\u201d\n\nAnnison also touched on the increasing use of cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and finance terrorist activities, highlighting TRON (TRX) and Tether (USDT) as popular assets for illicit use.\n\nThe advent of metaverse experiences has also seen the space attract nefarious actors. Various crimes are emerging in virtual worlds, including phishing attacks, nonfungible token theft, wallet tainting and augmented reality hacks.\n\nAnnison\u2019s presentation highlighted the reality of criminal activity in the sector, which will demand increased security measures to protect users and combat illicit activities.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime"

        "content": "Crypto heist couple Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan \u2014 who were charged with laundering $4.5 billion in hacked Bitcoin in 2016 \u2014 are reportedly preparing to plead guilty ahead of their next scheduled court appearance on Aug. 3.\n\nThe so-called \u201cBitcoin Bonnie & Clyde\u201d have been newly charged in the case with a document known as an information, which lays out criminal charges and is similar to an indictment, but which doesn\u2019t require a grand jury\u2019s vote, a Washington, D.C., federal court document filed Friday showed.\n\nFederal prosecutors have been known to use the special documents when defendants agree to plead guilty.\n\nRussian-born Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife Morgan, 32, previously pleaded not guilty in a February 2022 case that charged them of money laundering and conspiracy to defraud in the United States.\n\nThe pair were arrested at their Manhattan apartment earlier that month for allegedly attempting to launder an astounding $4.5 billion in cryptocurrency that had been stolen from Hong Kong\u2019s Bitfinex, one of the world\u2019s largest virtual cryptocurrency exchanges, in 2016.\n\n3 A new court filing hints that Ilya Lichtenstein (right) and Heather Morgan (left), who were charged with laundering $4.5 billion in hacked bitcoin back in 2016, appear to be gearing up to plead guilty. Alexandria Adult Detention Center\n\nFederal authorities accused the couple of trying to launder 119,754 bitcoin. At the time of the theft, the crypto amounted to about $70 million.\n\nHowever, at the time of their arrest, the price inflated into the billions. Today, 119,754 bitcoin is worth nearly $3.6 billion.\n\nLichtenstein \u2014 a Russian emigre known as \u201cDutch\u201d \u2014 was not granted bail, and has been in a Washington, D.C., jail since his arrest after being billed a flight risk.\n\nMorgan \u2014 better known as the questionably talented rapper \u201cRazzlekhan\u201d who shares songs about being \u201cthe crocodile of Wall Street\u201d \u2014 is free on a $3 million bond pending the outcome of negotiations.\n\nThe nature of the charges stated in the document are confidential, though the court docket showed that District of Columbia Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ordered the couple\u2019s defense to provide plea paperwork by Friday.\n\nJudge Kollar-Kotelly said the defendants\u2019 paperwork must include \u201ccharged offense(s) and statutory provision; charge(s) in plea and statutory provision; elements of the offense; copy of the plea agreement; penalties; and [federal sentencing] guideline calculations,\u201d according to the docket.\n\n3 Russian-born Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife Morgan, 32, previously pleaded not guilty in a February 2022 case that charged them of money laundering and conspiracy to defraud in the United States. Instagram/heatherreyhan\n\nThe Post has reached out to Lichtenstein\u2019s counsel at Cahill Gordon & Reindell, as well as Morgan\u2019s legal team at Burnham & Gorokhov.\n\nIf found guilty, Lichtenstein and Morgan could face up to 25 years years behind bars. It\u2019s unclear how a plea deal could affect their sentence.\n\nMorgan has been spending her 24-hour house arrest holed up in the rented Wall Street high-rise she once shared with her husband.\n\nThe downtime had Morgan looking for remote work. In September, she tweeted saying: \u201cLooking for remote B2B growth /marketing /sales /copywriting /demand gen work. Can be contract or potentially full-time. Have 10 years experience, including remotely managing distributed teams.\u201d\n\n3 Morgan \u2014 a rapper who goes by Razzlekhan \u2014 has been free on a $3 million bond while Russian emigre Lichtenstein has been jailed in Washington, D.C. since last February. YouTube\n\nShe also asked that only \u201cserious opportunities with B2B (tech) companies\u201d reach out.\n\nThe post came before a judge granted Morgan\u2019s request to amend the terms of her home confinement.\n\nIn January, US Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui ruled that she could work from her employer\u2019s New York office three days per week, from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.\n\nFaruqui also granted Morgan permission to use a computer and a smartphone \u2014 with monitoring software installed on both \u2014 in order to work from home, though she remained barred from carrying out any cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nMorgan\u2019s tweet appeared to have worked, as her lawyer, Eugene Gorokhov, said in a court filing that she was \u201cin the role of growth marketing and business development specialist.\u201d Her employer\u2019s identity was kept confidential for safety reasons.\n\nAside from the tweet on Morgan\u2019s job hunt, she\u2019s been quiet on all social media fronts, even halting her YouTube videos where she shared rap songs, ironically, about her being a hacking nerd.\n\nOn Instagram, the last post shared to Razzlekhan\u2019s account was on Feb. 7, 2022, where Morgan recorded herself complaining that she feels like \u201ca tortured dog going to the vet\u201d when she goes to the nail salon."

The block time for each cryptocurrency varies, with Bitcoin taking about 10 minutes.\n\nSimilar circumstances were reported in October of last year, when Bitcoin had a block production delay of about 85 minutes.\n\nBitcoin price action\n\nAt the time of publication, Bitcoin, which makes up approximately half of the $1.2 trillion cryptocurrency market, was changed little at $29,748. Since reaching a high for the year of $31,818 on July 13, it has fluctuated between $30,000 and $31,000.\n\nAs alternative cryptocurrencies resumed the surge that started last week after a court decision that was considered positive for the digital asset market, altcoins like Stellar (XLM) and Maker (MKR) are on the rise.\n\nThe on-chain analytics firm hints at ongoing consolidation for Bitcoin, saying that the 14-day Bitcoin Price Range remains extremely tight, residing at a current value of 6.38%.\n\nOn July 19, it was noted that with only 5.63% of trading hours recording a tighter 14-day trading range, the probability of a volatile move in either direction is enhanced.\n\nCrypto analyst Willy Woo says there are early signs that BTC consolidation is nearing completion.\n\nThis is because futures demand is currently moving the market. Notably, this demand has been climbing against sideways price action, which remains a bullish signal.\n\nWoo also noted that volatility dynamics might be signaling that a larger move is probable."

        "title": "Bitcoin price falls; Ether flat, Matic leads gainers, Solana the losers - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell on Friday morning in Asia as other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Bitcoin again slipped below support at US$30,000 after a week that saw buyers retreat. Developments in applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) failed to generate fresh investment, though some commentators say the pent up demand is there. Ether traded flat and is also a loser for the week. Matic led the early gainers on Friday, but is also in the red for the week.\n\nBitcoin backs off\n\nBitcoin fell 0.18% to US$29,824.09 as of 6:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has lost 4.53% in the past seven days.\n\nThe drop came amid further developments in Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications by U.S. asset managers.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF applications from BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, and WisdomTree on July 19 were published in the Federal Register, which means the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now has up to 240 days to accept or request the applications, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBloomberg research analyst James Seyffart wrote on Twitter that while this sets the clock ticking, the SEC may still reject all the applications.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed its spot Bitcoin ETF application on June 15, sparking a round of buying of cryptocurrencies on expectations more institutional funds will start investing in the asset class.\n\nWhile that enthusiasm has faded, Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based brokerage firm FxPro said latent demand for cryptocurrencies remains, although \u201cthe momentum is far from euphoric.\u201d Kuptsikevich added that Bitcoin continued to find support this week on dips below $30,000. \u201cA move to the upper boundary at $31,300 is most likely in this environment,\u201d he said.\n\nAsia Pacific institutional investors \u201cremain constructive across the digital asset complex following last week\u2019s positive news on [ETFs],\u201d said Matt Long, the APAC general manager of California-based international crypto brokerage FalconX. \u201cThey are well positioned for further appreciation in markets,\u201d said Long in an emailed statement to Forkast.\n\nU.S.-based digital asset manager Grayscale Investments said in a Friday report that about half of Bitcoin\u2019s 80% increase from December to mid-July relates to macro developments, while the rest is due to Bitcoin-specific positives.\n\n\u201cCrypto no longer behaves as its own ecosystem: Bitcoin and other digital assets are now more correlated with other market indicators,\u201d according to the report.\n\n\u201cSince January 2023, Bitcoin has appreciated more than can be explained by the rally in tech stocks and fall in the US Dollar. We think this reflects idiosyncratic positives, including optimism about eventual spot Bitcoin ETF approval, as well as Bitcoin\u2019s surge in March following stress in regional banks,\u201d Grayscale said.\n\n\u201cValuations are now more closely tied to broader macro trends, and more Fed tightening could be a headwind for higher risk assets, including both equities and cryptocurrencies,\u201d the report said.\n\nBack in Asia Friday morning trading, Ether edged up 0.31% to US$1,895.14, while falling 4.70% in the last week.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed \u2014 Polygon\u2019s Matic led gainers, rising 3.42% to US$0.7711. However, it posted a weekly loss of 8.46%.\n\nPolygon Labs is currently working on developing Polygon 2.0, a series of updates to the blockchain that the company says aim to make network governance more open and inclusive.\n\nSolana was the biggest loser among the top 10, declining 3.53% to US$25.49, amid a 0.72% weekly loss.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged down 0.15% in the past 24 hours to US$1.2 trillion, while trading volume jumped 19.19% to US$37.15 billion.\n\nNFTs fall; OpenSea launches swap feature\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.56% in the past 24 hours to 2,696.41 as of 08:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index gained a flat 0.01% in the last seven days.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 1.62% to US$18.69 million in the past 24 hours, according to data from CryptoSlam. Forkast NFT market indexes measuring performance on the Ethereum, Polygon and Solana blockchains all dropped, while the Cardano index rose.\n\nOn Thursday, NFT marketplace OpenSea announced that it is launching \u201cDeals,\u201d a new peer-to-peer NFT swap function. The company said in a tweet that this will help users avoid falling victim to \u201csketchy DMs & websites\u201d as OpenSea will provide the platform for users to directly engage with each other.\n\nYehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, says this feature is \u201cmore significant than people may realize.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the primary ways people are scammed in the NFT space is through fake trades. Often, legitimate trade sites are spoofed, and then trades offered through there,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cNow collectors will be able to trade using a platform they\u2019re already familiar with and trust, and the best part is there are no fees involved other than gas.\u201d\n\nCurrently, OpenSea allows only ERC-721 NFTs on Ethereum from verified collections to be traded on Deals. To make a \u201cdeal,\u201d a user can offer one or more NFTs in return for another user\u2019s NFTs, where one can also choose to add wrapped Ether (WETF) as part of the offer. The user accepting the deal will have to pay gas fees, according to OpenSea.\n\n\u201cEasy to use, and hopefully will have a major impact on lowering scams. This was long overdue.\u201d Petscher said.\n\nElsewhere, Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club topped CryptoSlam\u2019s NFT collection ranking by trading volume, rising 3.80% in the last day to US$1.4 million.\n\nEthereum was the top performing blockchain network by NFT trade volume, gaining 5.63% to US$13.73 million. Solana placed second, up 4.41% to US$1 million.\n\nU.S. equity futures gain after mixed session\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell | Image: Getty Images\n\nThe three major U.S. stock futures indexes gained as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong on Friday, after equities had a mixed regular trading session on Thursday.\n\nThe Dow Jones gained on top of strong Q2 earnings reports from Johnson & Johnson and Goldman Sachs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 slipped as Tesla tumbled on weak second-quarter gross margins and Netflix reported less-than-expected revenue.\n\nIn Asia, China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index gained, partially recovering from disappointing economic growth data for Q2. Investors are betting on Beijing to step up its economic stimulus measures, according to Trading Economics. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index also rose on China news of authorities possibly easing home buying limits in big cities.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 dipped after its inflation rate rose slightly in June. South Korea\u2019s Kospi also slipped.\n\nOn macro events, the next U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting is next week on July 26 when the central bank will make its next move on U.S. interest rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99.8% chance that the Fed will announce a further 25 basis points raise that will take rates to the 5.25%-5.50% range, which will be the highest since January 2001.\n\n(Updates to add equity section)"

        "title": "The last Bitcoin: What will happen once all BTC are mined? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block on Jan. 3, 2009, minting the first 50 Bitcoin (BTC) in history and kicking off what would become a billion-dollar industry centered around mining crypto. However, with a cap on Bitcoin supply, the fate of miners after the last coins are issued is unclear.\n\nBitcoin is created through mining, a process involving computer hardware to solve complex mathematical problems and verify transactions on the blockchain network. For their efforts, miners are rewarded with a predetermined amount of BTC for each block of transactions.\n\nAccording to the Blockchain Council, more than 19 million BTC has been awarded to miners in block rewards, and according to Nakamoto\u2019s white paper, only 21 million are available. Once this cap is reached, miners will no longer receive rewards for verifying transactions.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Nick Hansen, founder and CEO of Bitcoin mining firm Luxor Mining, says that despite the loss of block rewards, miners will continue to play an essential role in verifying and recording transactions on the blockchain, but how they are compensated will evolve.\n\nCurrently, successfully validating a new block on the blockchain rewards miners with 6.25 BTC, worth about $188,381 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko. Miners also receive transaction fees.\n\nAccording to calculations shared in a May 1 tweet from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, since 2010, fees and block rewards have netted miners over $50 billion.\n\nSince #Bitcoin's inception, Miners have earnt a total revenue of $50.2B from the block subsidy and fees, for an all-time estimated input cost of $36.6B.\n\n\n\nThis places the all-time-aggregate profit margin for Miners at $13.6B (+37%). pic.twitter.com/TYvBSZbsRo \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) May 2, 2023\n\nHansen believes transaction fees will eventually become the primary incentive for miners to continue long after the last BTC is mined.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why as transaction fees become an increasingly important part of Bitcoin mining economics, understanding transaction fee dynamics and forecasting them into the future becomes even more critical,\u201d he said, adding:\n\n\u201cThus, it\u2019s important to see fees increase over time, something that Bitcoin Ordinals, as of late, has helped with, for example.\u201d\n\nHowever, this shift is still likely years away, given that nobody currently mining will be alive when the last BTC block reward is received.\n\nIt will be a long wait to find out\n\nAccording to Hansen, based on the block discovery rate and the halving process, which occurs roughly every four years \u2014 or every 210,000 blocks of transactions \u2014 the last BTC will most likely be mined around 2140.\n\nA Bitcoin halving is a planned reduction in the rewards that miners receive, with the next one currently predicted to occur around April 2024. This will reduce the reward for each block to 3.125 BTC or roughly $94,190 at the time of writing.\n\nIn theory, by limiting the supply of BTC, each coin\u2019s value should increase as demand increases and supply remains fixed.\n\nHansen says the price of BTC in 2140 will depend on unpredictable factors such as market demand, the regulatory environment, technological advancements and macroeconomic factors.\n\n\u201cThe fact that all Bitcoin is in circulation may create scarcity, but whether this scarcity will translate to price increases is subject to market dynamics,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs we look to a future where all Bitcoin has been mined, it\u2019s important to remember that Bitcoin was designed with this endgame in mind.\n\n\u201cThe tapering off of block rewards and shift toward transaction fees are intrinsic to the protocol, and represent an ingenious solution to ensuring the ongoing security and viability of the network,\u201d Hansen added.\n\nRelated: Rising BTC transaction fees are a good thing, Bitcoin educator shares\n\nJaran Mellerud, a research analyst from Hashrate Index, told Cointelegraph that as Bitcoin adoption and usage grows, transaction fees will drastically increase and become the primary source of revenue for mining firms.\n\nMellerud said that, by the time the last BTC is issued, the block subsidy will have already been so minuscule that it will not significantly impact the coin supply.\n\n\u201cDue to the huge block space demand relative to the scarce block space supply, transaction fees will have to skyrocket in a future scenario of hyperbitcoinization,\u201d he said, adding:\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe there will be sufficiently high transaction fees in the future to justify the existence of mining, you don\u2019t really believe in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhat about fiat\n\nBy the time the last Bitcoin is mined, Mellerud believes its value won\u2019t be measured in United States dollars or other fiat currencies.\n\nHe speculates that by then, fiat money systems will have long since collapsed, and Bitcoin could be the successor, becoming the standard unit of account globally.\n\n\u201cUnder such circumstances, the only valid way to measure the purchasing power of Bitcoin is by looking at how much energy a Bitcoin or satoshi can purchase,\u201d Mellerud said.\n\n\u201cJust as we currently measure the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar in energy terms, barrels of oil,\u201d he added.\n\nA collapse of fiat money systems has long been predicted, spurred on by the many problems facing the traditional financial system. As recently as March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank collapsed due to a liquidity crisis, with Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank following.\n\nRelated: The first-world debt crisis means you can expect more pain ahead\n\nBefore the March 2023 banking crisis, a February survey conducted by business intelligence firm Morning Consult and commissioned by crypto exchange Coinbase found most respondents were already disillusioned with the global financial system.\n\nA large portion of respondents are disillusioned with the global financial system and want change. Source: Morning Consult\n\nBitcoin might not be the same in 120 years\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Pat White, co-founder and CEO of digital asset platform Bitwave, believes miners will remain a critical part of the ecosystem, but not all will survive, with some shutting down in the face of mounting costs.\n\nAccording to a March 24 report from Glassnode, since 2010, miners have already been experiencing long periods of unprofitability, with only 47% of trading days being profitable.\n\nAccording to data from Glassnode, miners have already been experiencing long periods of unprofitability. Source: Glassnode\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s conceivable we\u2019ll see some miners shut down or other manipulation techniques used in an effort to drive up fees,\u201d White said, adding:\n\n\u201cBut I also imagine that will happen well before the last Bitcoin is mined since the last few halvings will get the block rewards down to the satoshi level.\u201d\n\nHowever, White also says \u201ca lot can happen in 120 years,\u201d and BTC could fundamentally change over the next century.\n\nWhite believes that by 2140, quantum computers will likely have broken the core encryption under Bitcoin, though he says engineers working on it have long known it\u2019s not quantum-secure.\n\n\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t necessarily scare people because of this quantum security issue. Between now and 2140, there will have to be a major reworking of Bitcoin from the encryption layer upward,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt that point, the Bitcoin developer community will be able to assess whether or not we\u2019re actually on track to have a functioning transaction fee-based network or if additional Bitcoin mining is necessary to ensure the security of the network,\u201d White added.\n\nWhite further speculates that while Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s white paper states that 21 million BTC is the supply cap and the single most concrete rule, none of us will likely be alive by 2140 to enforce that rule.\n\nHe believes crypto boils down to coding and consensus; if the community thinks the transaction fee incentive is insufficient to keep the network secure, future miners could theoretically extend the BTC hard cap beyond 21 million.\n\nRelated: $160K at next halving? Model counts down to new Bitcoin all-time high\n\nWhat effect this could have on the price isn\u2019t clear, but either way, White thinks that the price of Bitcoin will stabilize at some global inflation-reflecting price point, and the major price movement will occur at some time in the next 120 years if one or more nations seriously pick it up as their reserve currency.\n\nIn that instance, he says it will \u201clikely be independent of Bitcoin mining schedules,\u201d and it would be the most solidifying moment to drive up the price of BTC.\n\nRelated: US law protects institutions and exposes retail investors \u2014 Rep. Torres\n\n\u201cThere are things we can\u2019t even imagine that might impact Bitcoin \u2014 wars and energy crises obviously \u2014 but what if we\u2019re a true multiplanetary species by then and we have to extend the block production time to support solar system-level communication speeds,\u201d White said.\n\n\u201cWhat I always find important is to focus on the hardest problems we\u2019re seeing today and do what we can to solve them. That might mean solving for payments or digital ownership, or banking the unbanked \u2014 these are the problems to focus on now,\u201d he added."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) stands to win big thanks to the BlackRock exchange-traded fund (ETF), investor and analyst Charles Edwards believes.\n\nIn his latest interview with Cointelegraph, Edwards, who is founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, goes deep into the current state of BTC price action.\n\nWith his previous bullish statements continuing to stand the test of time, and after an eventful few months, Edwards does not see the need to alter the long-term perspective.\n\nBitcoin, he argues, may be less of a sure bet on shorter timeframes, but the overarching narrative of crypto becoming a recognized global asset class undoubtedly remains.\n\nCointelegraph (CT): When we last spoke in February, Bitcoin price was around $25,000. BTC is not only 20% higher today, but Bitcoin\u2019s NVT ratio is also at its highest levels in a decade. Does this suggest more upside?\n\nCharles Edwards (CE): NVT is currently trading at a normal level. At 202, it is trading in the middle of the dynamic range band, well below the 2021 highs. Given its normalized reading today, it doesn't tell us much; just that Bitcoin is fairly valued according to this metric alone.\n\nBitcoin Dynamic Range NVT Signal, using Blockchain.com data. Source: Capriole Investments/TradingView\n\nCT: At the time, you described Bitcoin as being in a \u201cnew regime\u201d but forecast up to 12 months\u2019 upward grind to come. How has your thinking evolved since?\n\nCE: That thinking mostly remains today. Bitcoin has steadily grinded up about 30% since February. The difference today is that the relative value opportunity is slightly less as a result, and we are now trading into major price resistance at $32,000, which represents the bottom of the 2021 bull market range and confluence with major weekly and monthly order blocks.\n\nMy outlook today over the short term is mixed, with a bias towards cash until one of three things occurs:\n\nPrice clears $32,000 on daily/weekly timeframes, or Price mean-reverts to the mid-$20,000s, or On-chain fundamentals return to a regime of growth.\n\nCT: At $30,000, miners have begun to send BTC to exchanges en masse at levels rarely seen. Poolin, in particular, has moved a record amount in recent weeks. To what extent will miners\u2019 purported selling impact price moving forward?\n\nCE: It\u2019s true that relative Bitcoin miner sell pressure has stepped up. We can see that in the two below on-chain metrics; Miner Sell Pressure and Hash Ribbons. Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate is up 50% since January \u2014 that\u2019s over 100% annualized growth rate.\n\nThis rapid rate of growth is not sustainable long term. Hence we can expect any slowdown will trigger the typical Hash Ribbon capitulation. This rapid growth in hash rate also can only mean one thing; an extraordinary amount of new mining rigs have joined the network.\n\nIt\u2019s 50% harder to mine Bitcoin, there's 50% more competition and as a result 33% less relative BTC revenue for miners.\n\nThrough 2022 there were delays and backlogs in global mining hardware shipping for many months; we likely have seen that backlog flush out in the first half of the year with the large hash rate uptick. New mining hardware is costly, so it makes sense that miners would want to sell a bit more at relatively higher prices today to help cover operational costs and take advantage of the 100% price rally we have seen in the last 7 months.\n\nMiners are large Bitcoin stakeholders so if they are selling at a rapid rate it can impact prices. Though given their relative share of the network is diminishing, that risk factor is not what it once was.\n\nTwo on-chain metrics showing miner stress/selling. Source: Capriole Investments/TradingView\n\nCT: When it comes to U.S. macro policy, how do you see the Fed approaching inflation for the second half of the year? Are further hikes coming past July?\n\nCE: The market is pricing in a 91% chance of rate hikes through the rest of this year. There\u2019s a 99.8% chance that the Fed will raise rates at next week's meeting, according to the CME Group FedWatch Tool. So it's probable we see one or two more rate hikes in 2023. That seems quite excessive given inflation (CPI) has consistently been trending down since April 2022, and is now well below the Fed funds rate of 5%.\n\nOf course things could change quite a bit over the next months, but if we take two more rate hikes as the base case, my expectation that any net change in the Fed\u2019s plan would be toward a pause. We\u2019ve already seen the considerable stress building in the banking system, with multiple bank collapses just a couple of months ago. 2023 was the biggest banking failure of all time in dollar value; more than 2008, so things could change considerably over the next six months.\n\nRegardless, the Fed has implemented the vast majority of its rate hike plan. 90% of the tightening is complete. It's now a game of wait and see \u2014 will inflation continue to decline as anticipated? And will that occur before or after the economy takes a turn?\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart. Source: CME Group\n\nCT: Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with risk assets and inverse correlation with U.S. dollar strength has been declining of late. What\u2019s the reason for this? Is this part of a longer-term trend?\n\nCE: Bitcoin has historically spent most of its life \u201cuncorrelated\u201d with risk markets, oscillating from periods of positive to negative correlation. Correlation comes in waves. The last cycle happened to see a very strong correlation with risk assets. This began with the Corona crash on March 12, 2020. When fear peaks, all markets go risk-off (into cash) in unison, and we saw a huge spike in correlations across asset classes as a result.\n\nFollowing that crash, a wall of money entered risk markets from the biggest QE of all time. In that regard, the following year was \u201call one trade\u201d \u2014 up and to the right for risk. Then in 2022 we saw the unwinding of all risk assets as bonds repriced following the most aggressive Fed rate hike regime in history.\n\nSo it\u2019s been unusual times. But there is no intrinsic need for Bitcoin to have a high correlation to risk assets. It is likely with time that as Bitcoin becomes a multi-trillion-dollar asset, it will be more interconnected with major asset classes and so expect to see a more consistent positive correlation with gold over the next decade, which has a highly negative correlation with the dollar.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s correlation to the S&P 500 and Gold. Source: Capriole Investments/TradingView\n\nCT: How do you think U.S. regulatory pressure will impact Bitcoin and crypto markets going forward? Do you think Binance and Coinbase were the tip of the iceberg?\n\nCE: Impossible to say for sure, but I believe the regulatory fears of early 2023 have been well overblown. Bitcoin was long ago classified as a commodity, and from a regulatory perspective is in the clear. There\u2019s definitely question marks on various altcoins, but the legal outcome of XRP being deemed not a security was definitely an interesting turn of events this month.\n\nFinally, it's pretty clear that industry and government \u2014 where it matters \u2014 is in support of this asset class and knows it's here to stay.\n\nBlackRock ETFs have a 99.8% success rate and its announcement to launch a Bitcoin ETF was essentially a regulatory and financial industry green light.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen half a dozen other leading-tier financial institutions follow suit and, of course, now presidential candidate Kennedy is talking about backing the dollar with Bitcoin. This asset class is here to stay. There will be bumps and hiccups along the way, but the direction is clear to me.\n\nCT: How do you foresee progress of the BlackRock spot ETF and its effect on Bitcoin should it launch?\n\nCE: The BlackRock ETF approval will be huge for the industry.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin traders say \u2018get ready\u2019 as BTC price preps 2023 bull market\n\nBlackRock is the biggest asset manager in the world, and its (and regulatory) seal of approval will allow a new wave of capital to flow into the market. Many institutions sat on the sidelines last year due to concerns and uncertainty regarding crypto regulation. ETF approval will be a big rubber \u201cyes\u201d stamp for Bitcoin.\n\nETFs also arguably make it easier for institutions to put Bitcoin on their balance sheet, as they don't need to worry about custody or even entering the crypto space. So it opens a lot of doors. The best comparable we have for this event is the gold ETF launch in 2004. Interestingly it launched when gold was down 50% (much like Bitcoin is today). What followed was a massive +350% return, seven-year bull run.\n\nEssentially the Bitcoin ETF is just another goalpost on the pathway to broad regulatory acceptance and establishment of Bitcoin as a serious asset class. And it has big implications.\n\nCFDs on Gold annotated chart. Source: Charles Edwards/TradingView\n\nMagazine: Should you \u2018orange pill\u2019 children?

        "title": "Bitcoin miners still bullish despite toughest bear market yet \u2014 Hut8, Foundry, Braiins - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) miners have been up against the ropes over the past year, with record amounts of BTC sent to centralized exchanges to cover costs in 2023.\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, the Bitcoin mining ecosystem has had an eventful year. The industry scored a staggering $184 million from transaction fees in the second quarter of 2023, eclipsing the total of 2022 on the back of a BTC price rebound and hype around BRC-20 tokens.\n\nStocks in prominent mining firms have also seen impressive gains in 2023, far exceeding Bitcoin\u2019s market value performance. The top nine public Bitcoin mining firms saw their market capitalization increase by 257% from the start of 2023.\n\nMeanwhile miners have also been forced to continue selling mined BTC to cover operational costs as the industry continues to attempt to claw its way out of a prolonged bear market. Miners sent a record $128 million worth of Bitcoin to exchange in June 2023, with industry experts highlighting miners' propensity to send BTC to exchange to cash out, cover costs and lock in profits.\n\nRelated: How Irish farmers turn cow dung into digital gold (Bitcoin)\n\nA market report from Bitfinex suggests that mining firms are looking to derisk by offloading BTC to exchanges. Analysts believe miners are engaging in hedging activities in the derivatives market, carrying out over-the-counter orders or transferring funds through exchanges for other reasons.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to a number of prominent mining companies to unpack the current mining climate and the recent trends emerging from the sector.\n\nJaime Leverton, CEO of Hut8, highlighted the company\u2019s efforts to close-off a merger with USBTC which has hampered its ability to raise capital through an at-the-market offering. After announcing the upcoming merger, Leverton said Hut8 treasury strategy included the option selling from its Bitcoin holdings and newly produced BTC to cover its operating costs:\n\n\u201cWe plan to revisit our treasury strategy once our merger is complete. As such, we were the last major Bitcoin miner to sell part of our production earlier this year.\n\nLeverton added that Hut8 still holds more that 9,100 BTC ($271 million) and the firm remains \u201cbullish on Bitcoin and HODLing\u201d, given that it retains one of the largest self-mined Bitcoin reserves from a publicly traded company.\n\nHut8 disclosed that it had sold 217 Bitcoin mined across May and June for $7.9 million in its most recently published production and operation update.\n\nRelated: A Glimpse Into The Future - What Happens When There Are No More Bitcoin To Mine?\n\nFoundry\u2019s business development senior manager Charles Chong also weighed in on the subject, while the firm declined to comment on whether it had held any BTC holdings in 2023.\n\nAs Chong explained, bull market conditions in the past saw miners earning a 60-80% margin on production, while external capital was abundant, allowing many operators to hold onto their mined BTC.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are in a different time now with scarce external capital and only a 15-30% margin, forcing miners to liquidate their bitcoin to cover operational costs.\u201d\n\nChong also added that it was difficult to compare current market conditions to subsequent bear markets following market peaks in 2017 and 2021. He said that Bitcoin mining moved in cycles as miners \u201coverinvest\u201d in ASIC mining equipment during good times.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Bitcoin mining difficulty has also hit recent all time highs, which suggests that the network is at its most robust. Chong explained that new, more efficient mining capable of higher hashrates have continuously been released into the market in 2023, which has forced miners to refresh their fleet to continue producing BTC at a profit.\n\n\u201cThat said, total energy usage by the network has been slowly creeping up as well, albeit at a slower pace, indicating increasing investment in security for the network.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson from Braiins mining told Cointelegraph that continuing difficulty increases are a result of hashrate increasing, which signals that industry participants see potential upside for BTC's price in the future:\n\n\"To us, this is a sign that miners are still able to deploy machines profitably in the current environment and are bullish on Bitcoin's future price appreciation.\"\n\nOngoing market conditions have also seen the closure of some prominent mining firms, including Core Scientific which filed its chapter 11 bankruptcy plan in June 2023. The firm has already managed to raise significant capital to bootstrap a reorganization plan earmarked for September 2023 .\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is lining up a burst of volatility that could rival its 40% January gains, on-chain data suggests.\n\nIn the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, The Week On-Chain, analytics firm Glassnode revealed the tightest Bollinger Bands since the start of 2023.\n\nBTC price due \u201cstrong moves\u201d \u2014 but direction unknown\n\nBTC price has acted in a tight range for an entire month, using $30,000 as a focal point for sideways behavior.\n\nThis, popular analyst Aksel Kibar says, is putting both bulls and bears to the test.\n\n\u201cSeems like $BTCUSD is exhausting many trader\u2019s patience,\u201d he summarized on July 21.\n\n\u201cThat is usually the condition you see before strong moves.

        "content": "Pan Gongsheng, tipped to be the next governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, is poised to continue taking a hard line on cryptocurrency trading and mining.\n\nChina has pushed major blockchain projects to support CBDCs and distributed ledger infrastructure.\n\nWestern-educated economist may take critical position as China struggles to revive its economy.\n\nWhen it comes to crypto, some hope China is on the rebound.\n\nHong Kong is reviving as a startup scene, state-run companies are pushing hard to get consumers to use digital yuan, and Beijing is backing an ambitious programme to build blockchain infrastructure for global businesses.\n\nBut there may be one major obstacle ahead \u2014 Pan Gongsheng, the deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC). The Harvard and Cambridge-educated economist is tipped to be the next governor of the central bank.\n\nAnd he is not a big fan of Bitcoin and its ilk.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nCommunist party secretary\n\nNow speculation is mounting in both Chinese and foreign press that Pan is set to replace Yi Gang as the governor of the PBOC, which is one of the most influential positions in global banking.\n\nOn July 1, he was promoted to the communist party secretary at the central bank. And on July 8, Janet Yellen, the US Secretary of the Treasury, appeared to anticipate another promotion when a readout of her meeting with Pan called him the \u201chead\u201d of the PBOC during her diplomatic visit to Beijing.\n\nFreudian slip? US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen referred to Pan Gongsheng as the 'head' of the People's Bank of China (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Rita Fortunato)\n\nRumours of his appointment have dashed hopes of a reversal on crypto policy in China. He\u2019s been referred to as \u201canti-Bitcoin\u201d and \u201cBitcoin\u2019s worst nightmare\u201d in the English-language crypto press.\n\nThe characterisations are based on a series of comments he made in the months after the 2017 ICO craze. He referred to Bitcoin as a speculative bubble and likened it to the tulip mania in 17th century Holland \u2013 and doesn\u2019t think it will last.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nQuoting Keynes\n\n\u201cThe market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent,\u201d Pan reportedly said at a forum that year, invoking a famed comment from British economist John Maynard Keynes. \u201cSit by the river, watch, and one day the corpse of Bitcoin will float past you,\u201d Pan added, paraphrasing French economist \u00c9ric Pichet.\n\nAt the same time, he added he was a \u201clittle scared\u201d at the thought of unrestricted digital assets in China.\n\nBut his views reflect the general consensus in Beijing about cryptocurrency: it\u2019s volatile, destined to collapse, and has no place in the Chinese financial system.\n\nNOW READ: Multichain workers in China fear for safety after CEO\u2019s arrest, says Fantom boss\n\nPan has been a steady presence in the commercial banking sector in China for the last 20 years. He earned a Ph.D in economics at the Renmin University of China and then did postdoctoral research at the University of Cambridge in the UK and was a senior research fellow at Harvard University in the US.\n\nPrior to joining the PBOC in December 2012, he held several roles at the Industrial and Commerce Bank of China and served as executive director at the Agricultural Bank of China. Since April 2016, he\u2019s been deputy governor of the central bank and held other senior positions.\n\n\u2018Sit by the river, watch, and one day the corpse of Bitcoin will float past you.\u2019 \u2014 Pan Gongsheng, paraphrasing \u00c9ric Pichet\n\nBut whether his views on crypto have changed since he last spoke about it publicly isn\u2019t known. \u201cHe is a bit of an elusive new character. But he\u2019s also not that public of a figure,\u201d Kai von Carnap, an analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, tells DL News.\n\nNaturally, crypto is not high on the list of priorities for China\u2019s next central bank governor.\n\nThe Chinese economic situation, several months on from the relaxation of Covid restrictions, is only just starting to find its feet again. The IMF predicts the economy will expand 5.2% this year following the lifting of pandemic restrictions. But its growth is expected to slow after the reopening boost.\n\nNOW READ: Why China\u2019s rocky CBDC rollout is a \u2018severe\u2019 warning sign to Europe and America\n\n\u201cThe contraction in real estate remains a major headwind, and there is still some uncertainty around the evolution of the virus. Longer-term, headwinds to growth include a shrinking population and slowing productivity growth,\u201d wrote IMF economist Diego A. Cerdeiro and Sonali Jain-Chandra, another senior official at the fund, earlier this year.\n\nChina also wants to instil confidence in foreign investors and businesses who are wary of committing more capital to the nation amid tense relations with the US and the West.\n\n\u2018He has the kind of background where he can talk to international people, to the Fed, to the ECB. I think that probably gave him the edge over potential competitors.\u2019 \u2014 Kai von Carnap\n\n\u201cYou need to have this kind of character who can mediate some of the messaging,\u201d von Carnap said. \u201cHe has the kind of background where he can talk to international people, to the Fed, to the ECB. I think that probably gave him the edge over potential competitors.\u201d\n\nAs head of the PBOC, the digital yuan will also come under his portfolio. Von Carnap points to his expertise as useful for its internationalisation, though he cautions that it is still a mostly domestic project.\n\nBut is he in charge?\n\nThere has been no official statement yet as to his accession. This week, Yi declined to comment about his possible retirement during a lecture on the digital yuan organised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\n\u201cMy title is right here on the screen,\u201d he said, although according to Channel News Asia a powerpoint at the event called him the \u201cPresident of the China Society for Finance and Banking\u201d as opposed to governor of the PBOC.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s crypto push\n\nThat said, Yi, 65, was appointed to a second five-year term as governor by the National People\u2019s Congress in March. It\u2019s not clear whether that was for the purpose of helping to usher in a new leader. Yi has reached the retirement age for ministerial officials (Pan himself turns 60 this month).\n\nAs for crypto, Chinese entrepreneurs are hopeful that Hong Kong\u2019s push to rekindle startup activity would spur the same story on the mainland. Tron founder and Huobi advisor Justin Sun, gushed about Hong Kong\u2019s new crypto policies to Bloomberg TV late last year.\n\n\u201cRight now they are using Hong Kong as an experiment base so they can see all the feedback, all the results, once they adopt crypto,\u201d he said.\n\nNOW READ: China wants 1.4bn citizens to use digital yuan for shopping and bus fares, but consumers still love Alipay\n\nA burgeoning start-up scene in Hong Kong won\u2019t persuade officials in China to abandon their view that cryptocurrencies are little more than a speculative bubble, even if Pan doesn\u2019t take the job.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how Hong Kong regulation would reflect or imply a change in Chinese crypto regulations by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d says von Carnap.\n\nCallan Quinn, based in Hong Kong, covers Asia for DL News.

        "title": "XRP Dwarfs Bitcoin as Post-SEC Result Continues to Benefit Ripple - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nXRP dominates in volume terms since SEC\u2019s decision about it not being security\n\nXRP has outperformed BTC, accounting for 21% of all crypto transaction volume, to BTC\u2019s 20%\n\nStill, the volume of transactions is declining, so it could mean the end of the rally\n\nSince the court determined that XRP is not a security, it has dominated in terms of volume, recently outpacing Bitcoin in terms of market cap volume.\n\nXRP Eclipsing Bitcoin\n\nA recent Twitter conversation brought up XRP\u2019s increased trading volume by Dirk Schepens, the founder of xSPECTAR, an XRPL-based NFT project. He claimed that XRP had eclipsed Bitcoin (BTC) as the cryptocurrency with the largest trading activity following the court decision.\n\nWithin a 24-hour period after Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 ruling, XRP\u2019s trading volume had surpassed $10 billion.\n\nAnd while some questioned the accuracy of Schepens\u2019 information, Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz answered provocatively.\n\nXRP's trading volume as a percentage of market cap is four times higher than BTC's. I'm not sure if that's good, bad, interesting, or meaningless. \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 19, 2023\n\nSchwartz noted that there are many possible interpretations because XRP\u2019s trading volume as a percentage of its market cap is four times higher than BTC\u2019s.\n\nCalculating the Claims\n\nWith a trading volume of $2,248,762,398 and a market value of $$40,688,646,47, according to CoinMarketCap data analysis, it is clear that XRP has displayed exceptional trading activity during the last 24 hours.\n\nBTC, on the other hand, had a trading volume of $$13,569,814,934 and a large market cap of $579,361,777,905.\n\nIt has to be taken into account the trading volume as a proportion of the market capitalization for both XRP and BTC and compare the findings in order to verify Schwartz\u2019s claim.\n\nA closer examination of the data reveals that the trading volume of XRP as a percentage of its market capitalization is roughly 9%. BTC\u2019s percentage, which is 2%, is considerably lower in contrast.\n\nThese numbers support Schwartz\u2019s earlier assertion and highlight XRP\u2019s larger percentage of actively traded tokens in comparison to its market valuation.\n\nCumulative Spot Volume for XRP\n\nAdditionally, Kaiko , a trustworthy source of market information, provided insights on XRP\u2019s gaining significance in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe report claims that after the key court decision, XRP has outperformed BTC, accounting for 21% of all crypto transaction volume to BTC\u2019s 20%. Ethereum (ETH) recorded a meager 8% share in contrast.\n\nThe trading activity on the sports market since July 13 is considered in this report from Kaiko and Schepens\u2019 declaration.\n\nThis does not consider the 24-hour volume of trades across all marketplaces, since BTC continues to outperform XRP. Kaiko pointed out that data from 25 exchanges were used in the evaluation.\n\nAdditionally, data from the market data source CryptoCompare demonstrates that XRP and BTC are closely matched regarding trade volume. Notably, the volume for BTC is $1.95 billion, while the volume for XRP is $1.57 billion. Commentators contend that because CryptoCompare only examines spot volume, XRP might have previously surpassed BTC on this criteria.\n\nSimilar to how XRP dominated South Korean markets, earning at least $2.5 billion after a US court determined that the digital asset is not a security.\n\nThe XRP Rally May Be Coming to an End\n\nHowever, given that the token\u2019s trading volume is beginning to decline, XRP rally may be nearing its end.\n\nThe ongoing decline in trading volume might perhaps result in a price reversal for XRP, which is now trading close to its local top. Following a landmark legal victory over the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP\u2019s trading volume has been an important factor to monitor during its spectacular price surge.\n\nThe current drop may indicate a change in market sentiment, given that the token\u2019s price ascent was mostly driven by an increase in trade volume.\n\nThe drop in volume shows that fewer XRP-related transactions are taking place. This frequently suggests that traders may begin to take profits or reduce their purchase activities during a price rally, possibly in anticipation of a market shift.\n\nThis signals that we might be approaching a turning point in the recent price trajectory of the token, together with the fact that XRP is trading close to its local top.\n\nA price reversal can occur if this volume decline keeps up. A rally\u2019s large volume frequently reflects fervent investor interest and confidence in the prospects of the asset. However, if volume falls, it can be a sign that interest is dwindling and a sell-off is about to occur."

        "title": "Towards a trustless Bitcoin wallet with miniscript - Ledger",
        "content": "\n\nThings to know:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Miniscript makes it possible to build Bitcoin software wallets that make a backdoor impossible to exploit in the hardware wallet. We\u2019re glad to say that Ledger is the first commercial hardware wallet manufacturer to support miniscript.\n\n\n\n\u2013 The additional features can be implemented without compromising the user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware signing devices are engineered to safeguard the user from various common attack vectors, such as:\n\nUnauthorized access and extraction of the seed\n\nMalware infecting your associated software wallet\n\nSoftware vulnerabilities on the device itself\n\nLike any business, it\u2019s in the manufacturer\u2019s best interest to make devices as unbreakable as they can. Succeeding in this mission is paramount, and security companies like Ledger rely on a reputation built on their track record.\n\nHowever, some users might still have concerns. What prevents the company itself from hiding a backdoor in the devices?\n\nIn self-custody, we don\u2019t trust, we verify.\n\nBut can the user really verify that a device does not have a backdoor?\n\nThat\u2019s the key question this article delves into. More precisely, this article tackles the following topics:\n\nwhat is a backdoor, and why it\u2019s difficult, if not impossible, to prove that there isn\u2019t one;\n\nwhy only users can protect themselves from this risk;\n\nhow miniscript enables practical solutions to this challenge for bitcoin wallets.\n\nBy being the first hardware wallet to support miniscript, we hope to inspire developers to build secure solutions and upgrade our whole industry, and eliminate the chance of such a systemic risk from ever materializing.\n\nHow to build the unbackdoorable signing device\n\nLet\u2019s put it clearly: you can\u2019t.\n\nTo defend yourself against a potential backdoor, you need a different attack model than the one we outlined above: in this scenario, the adversary could be the vendor themselves, or a corrupted insider.\n\nThe often-touted solution to this issue is Open Source: after all, if you can inspect the code, what could possibly go wrong?\n\nHowever, the truth is more complex. Since the vendor assembles the hardware, a backdoor could be entirely contained within it. The hardware could be designed to disregard the software at certain points and execute malicious code instead.\n\nUnlike software that runs on general-purpose computing devices (like your laptop or phone), scrutinizing the hardware is practically impossible with today\u2019s technology. Even if the hardware specifications were entirely open source, complete with the details of every single gate in the circuit, you would still need high-cost equipment to verify that a specific chip is built in accordance with them.\n\nHow to backdoor a hardware wallet\n\nHere are a few of the simplest methods a malicious hardware vendor could use to introduce a backdoor, along with some ways power users can protect themselves today.\n\nSeed generation\n\nMany devices offer you the ability to generate a seed (also called the Secret Recovery Phrase) directly on the device, using a True Random Number Generator.\n\n\ud83d\ude08 The evil device could generate seeds that appear random but are actually predictable to the attacker.\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Power users can circumvent this problem by generating a mnemonic offline. Additionally, incorporating a robust passphrase can also generate an entirely independent seed that the hardware vendor cannot predict. The trade-off is that users must ensure they properly back up the passphrase in addition to the mnemonic words.\n\nPublic key derivation\n\nHardware wallets derive and export the public keys (also called xpubs, short for extended public key as defined in BIP-32. The xpubs are used to generate the possible addresses for receiving coins.\n\n\ud83d\ude08 The evil device could return public keys controlled by the attacker instead of the correct ones derived from the seed.\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Users could validate the derived xpub on another, offline device. However, entering the seed on other devices carries its own risks. Security-aware users might deem any device that has accessed the seed as dangerous, potentially to the point of destroying them. The typical user might struggle to correctly perform this procedure while managing the additional risks.\n\nLeaking information\n\nAn airgap is frequently proposed as a solution to prevent a malicious or compromised device from exfiltrating private keys. After all, if a device can\u2019t communicate with the outside world, it can\u2019t do anything harmful, right?\n\nNot quite!\n\nThe device can always communicate when it\u2019s in use: it produces signatures. These signatures end up inside transactions that are broadcast and stored forever on the blockchain.\n\nA signature is a random-looking byte string of at least 64 bytes. However, since more than one valid signature can correspond to the same message, a malicious device could communicate a few bits of information every time a signature is produced, by generating multiple signatures and selectively choosing which to publish.\n\n\ud83d\ude08 A rogue device might produce non-random signatures that, over many transactions, reveal the seed to the attacker!\n\nAn attacker successful in installing such a backdoor would merely have to wait for malicious signatures to appear on the blockchain until they have enough information to reconstruct the entire seed.\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f For ECDSA signatures, using a standardized method of deriving the nonce deterministically (like RFC6979) thwarts this attack, provided one validates that the produced signature matches the expected one. However, ensuring this is the case requires loading a second device with the same seed, which leads to the same practical problems mentioned in the previous section.\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f An interesting approach is to use a smart way to force the device to actually choose a random nonce. A protocol for this purpose, known as anti-exfil or anti-klepto, is currently implemented in Blockstream Jade and ShiftCrypto BitBox02 hardware wallets. Read more on ShiftCrypto\u2019s blog, which also includes a technical description of how such an attack might be executed.\n\nOk then, is there no hope?\n\nMost of the defenses\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f listed above mostly require the user to perform explicit, intrusive actions in order to protect themselves: either by generating the seed on their own (essentially, using their brain to replace the functionality from the hardware wallet), or utilizing an additional device to verify that computations are correctly executed.\n\nHowever, the anti-exfil protocol stands out: given that there\u2019s always a machine intermediating between the hardware signer and the outside world, this machine can assist. Through an interactive protocol with the hardware signer, it can enforce the use of a genuinely random nonce, thereby diminishing or eliminating the chance of significantly manipulating the final signature.\n\nIn this blog post, we are primarily interested in these types of measures: while strategies that significantly worsen the UX could be appealing to power users, they are likely to make things worse in practice for the less technically adept users \u2212 which is the vast majority.\n\nThe security model\n\nStandard model for hardware signers\n\nHardware signer manufacturers aim to protect users from a variety of potential threats (for more details, see Threat Model). In this article, we focus on one, very important property, that can be summarized as follows:\n\nUsers can\u2019t be deceived into an action resulting in fund loss, provided they understand and verify the on-screen information prior to approval.\n\nApproval is needed for any sensitive action, particularly signatures. Protecting the seed would be futile if malware could produce signatures for arbitrary messages, such as a transaction draining all the funds!\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to emphasize that the above property must hold true even if the software wallet is completely compromised. What\u2019s displayed on your laptop/phone screen cannot be trusted: malware could replace addresses, deceive you about which addresses are yours, present a transaction but then forward a different one to the device for signing, etc.\n\nTherefore, the firmware and applications running on a hardware signing device consider the software wallet inherently untrusted and untrustworthy.\n\nAnti-backdoor security model for software wallets\n\nIn this section, we flip the roles completely. We now want to design a software wallet that prevents the hardware manufacturer from stealing or causing fund loss, even if the device is completely malicious.\n\nHence, this can\u2019t be a property of the device: rather, it\u2019s a property of the software wallet setup. We could summarize it as follows:\n\nProvided that the software wallet is not compromised, the hardware manufacturer cannot cause the user to lose funds.\n\nThis may seem counterintuitive, as it directly contradicts the standard security model detailed above. However, \u201cnot having a backdoor\u201d means \u201cdoing exactly what they are supposed to do\u201d. Since the software wallet is the sole interface between the signing device and the external world, it\u2019s the only place where protection against misbehavior can be enforced \u2212 whether because of a bug, or explicit compromission of the device.\n\nNote that this model extends significantly beyond a device failure, such as an exploitable bug. In this case, we\u2019re operating within a scenario where the device is actively seeking to cause fund loss.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no possible protection if the manufacturer has successfully compromised both the device and also your machine that runs the software wallet. Therefore, it\u2019s absolutely vital to ensure that your software wallet is Open Source and auditable, especially if built by the same vendor that manufactures the hardware.\n\nThe role of miniscript\n\nMiniscript equips wallet developers with the ability to fully utilize the advanced features of bitcoin Script. For an overview of the incredible possibilities miniscript unlocks, refer to our previous blog post. You might also want to listen to Episode 452 of the Stephan Livera Podcast for a discussion on what miniscript brings to the bitcoin landscape.\n\nThe Ledger Bitcoin app supports miniscript since its 2.1.0 release, which was deployed in February 2023. At the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, Wizardsardine announced the 1.0 release of their Liana wallet, the first deployed wallet based on miniscript.\n\nThe basic idea of this post is that a bitcoin wallet account can be protected not just with one, but with multiple keys. This allows flexible security frameworks where even a total failure or compromission of a key is not catastrophic.\n\nMultisig musings\n\nMultisig is a significant upgrade in the strength of a self-custody solution. By leveraging the programmability of Bitcoin Script, it enables the creation of wallets that necessitate multiple keys instead of just one. A k-of-n multisig wallet requires a combination of k valid signatures, out of a total of n possible ones.\n\nHowever, multisig also places a UX burden on the user, and introduces new opportunities for errors. A 3-of-3 multisig setup, involving three different keys securely backed up in separate locations, offers strong security\u2026 but it also means that if even a single key is lost, the coins become permanently inaccessible!\n\nTherefore, setups offering more redundancy (like 2-of-3, or 3-of-5) tend to be more popular: should a single key be lost, the other keys can still facilitate recovery. But this introduces a tradeoff: if one key is compromised unbeknownst to you, the overall security is significantly reduced!\n\nCompanies like Casa and Unchained Capital specialize in self-custody solutions where they hold a minority of the keys for their customers. They also assist their users by guiding them through the onboarding process and simplifying the use of custody systems, which can otherwise be daunting for most non-technical users.\n\nMiniscript and time-locked recovery paths\n\nLiana uses miniscript to create wallets that have multiple ways of spending:\n\na primary spending condition, which is immediately available;\n\none or more additional spending conditions that become available after a certain period (the so-called timelock).\n\nThis enables many interesting use cases:\n\nRecovery : A standard wallet with either single-signature or multisig as the primary spending path; but a separate recovery mechanism (a key with a different seed, a multisig, a tech-savvy friend, a custodian) becomes available after 6 months.\n\n: A standard wallet with either single-signature or multisig as the primary spending path; but a separate recovery mechanism (a key with a different seed, a multisig, a tech-savvy friend, a custodian) becomes available after 6 months. Governance : A company with two directors could establish a 2-of-2 for the company\u2019s treasury; in case of disagreement, a trusted lawyer could access the funds after 6 months.\n\n: A company with two directors could establish a 2-of-2 for the company\u2019s treasury; in case of disagreement, a trusted lawyer could access the funds after 6 months. Decaying multisig : A wallet starts as a 3-of-3, transitions to a 2-of-3 after 6 months, and becomes a 1-of-3 after 9 months.\n\n: A wallet starts as a 3-of-3, transitions to a 2-of-3 after 6 months, and becomes a 1-of-3 after 9 months. Automatic inheritance: The recovery path after 6 months includes a 2-of-3 of your three children; perhaps a second recovery path after 1 year involves a notary, in case the heirs can\u2019t reach a consensus.\n\nRemark: all the examples above use a relative timelock, which refers to the age of the coins (that is: the last time the funds were moved). The trade-off is that the user must remember to spend the coins (by sending them to themselves) if the timelock is nearing expiration.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but they should be enough to convince the reader that miniscript is a significant step forward towards realizing Bitcoin\u2019s potential as programmable money.\n\nWallet policy registration\n\nFor Bitcoin wallet accounts utilizing multiple keys (be it multisig, or more sophisticated miniscript-based solutions), it\u2019s crucial to train the device to identify the addresses that belong to that account. This is the only way the device can aid the user in ensuring that they\u2019re receiving or spending from the correct addresses\u2026\n\nValidating the policy and the xpubs of the cosigner against a trusted backup is essential, but relatively time-consuming.\n\nThe good news is that it only needs to be done once:\n\nOnce a policy is registered with a name (in the example \u201cDecaying 3of3\u201d), your device will be able to recognize it whenever such a policy is employed.\n\nThose interested in technical details can find more information in the BIP proposal.\n\nPolicy backup\n\nOne critical aspect to note is that while multi-key policies permit a subset of the private keys to authorize transactions, the knowledge of all the public keys (and the exact policy) are required.\n\nHowever, unlike the seed, backing up the policy and the public keys is far less risky: if someone were to discover it, they could trace all the transactions linked to that policy. Although this is not ideal \u2212 privacy matters! \u2212 it is not as disastrous as losing your coins and less enticing for potential attackers. Consequently, storing multiple copies of the policy in hot wallets, printing it and storing it in various places, encrypting it and storing it in cloud storage, and so on, are all viable strategies.\n\nThe unbackdoorable single-signature wallet\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back. We\u2019ve discussed multi-signature wallets, but now we\u2019re going back to basics to create a single-signature wallet. More precisely, we want a wallet that feels and looks like a single-signature wallet, after an initial setup phase. Yet, we aim to create a wallet from which the manufacturer cannot steal your funds even if they are malicious \ud83d\ude08, and the hardware signing device behaves in unpredictable ways.\n\nThe approach can easily be generalized for multi-signature wallets.\n\nThe examples below will be written in a language called policy, rather than miniscript. Policy is easier for humans to read and think about, and can be compiled to miniscript with automated tools. Read more about miniscript and policy.\n\nThe hardware wallet can protect you in the standard security model. Miniscript can protect you in the anti-backdoor security model (and much more!).\n\nStep zero: the status quo\n\nThis is the policy most users use today: a single key that is derived from a seed produced in the hardware wallet.\n\npk(key_ledger)\n\nOf course, there is no way of proving the absence of a backdoor.\n\nStep one: double those keys\n\nThe first step is simple:\n\nand(pk(key_ledger), pk(key_client))\n\nHere, key_client is generated on the user\u2019s machine, hence a hot key. Essentially, it\u2019s a 2-of-2 multisig setup. The key aspect is that the user doesn\u2019t interact much with key_client : the software wallet generates this key, includes it in the wallet\u2019s backup, and signs whenever needed (for example, while the user is busy signing with their hardware signer).\n\nThis already seems quite interesting: the funds are unspendable without key_client , which is unavailable to the hardware vendor; even if the evil vendor had full knowledge of the key in the device, they would still be unable to move the funds without explicitly targeting the user, for example by compromising the machine that runs their software wallet.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s an issue: during wallet onboarding, the hardware signer is the only entity capable of generating the public key (xpub) key_ledger used in the wallet. Hence, the device could intentionally generate a wrong xpub controlled by the attacker, and later decline (or be unable) to sign. Arguably, this is a fairly extreme attack scenario: the backdoor creator can\u2019t steal the funds, and the most they can do is individually target the user and demand a ransom (\u201cI can help you retrieve your money if you pay half to me\u201d).\n\nMore realistically, this increases the chance of mistakes of mistakes: you now have two seeds / private keys, and you need both in order to be able to spend. Lose either, and coins are locked forever.\n\nStep two: timelocked recovery\n\nWe introduce a separate recovery key, accessible only after a specific timelock: and(older(25920) , pk(key_recovery)) , where 25920 is the approximate number of blocks in 6 months. The full policy becomes:\n\nor( and(pk(key_ledger), pk(key_client)), and(after(25920), pk(key_recovery)) )\n\nThis is similar to the previous scenario, but with a twist: if key_ledger or key_client becomes unavailable for any reason (most commonly, losing the seed backup!), a recovery path becomes accessible after 6 months.\n\nThere are several options for key_recovery , each with its own tradeoffs:\n\na. Use another hot key. This is a practical solution as long as the user remembers to reset the timelock. However, if the hot keys are compromised (a scenario that should generally be considered quite likely!), the attacker could attempt to access the funds as soon as the timelock expires, initiating a race with the legitimate owner.\n\nb. Use a separate hardware signing device. This is a robust solution and can be used in combination with a different vendor if desired; however, it increases the setup complexity and cost for the user in terms of user experience.\n\nc. Use a trusted external service. The software wallet could import an xpub from an external service, using it as key_recovery . This third party is only trusted if the timelock expires, which could be an appealing tradeoff for some users.\n\nAs mentioned, like for any policy with timelocks, it is important that the user remembers to refresh the coins before the expiration of the timelock.\n\nStep three: the untrusted third party\n\nLet\u2019s blend both ideas (a) and (c): for the recovery path, we require a local hot key key_recovery_local , and a key_recovery_remote that is hosted with a semi-trusted service; we also retain the timelock.\n\nor(\n\nand(pk(key_ledger), pk(key_client)),\n\nand(older(25920),\n\nand(pk(key_recovery_local), pk(key_recovery_remote))\n\n)\n\n)\n\nThis decreases the level of trust needed from the recovery service. However, we must exercise caution: the service itself could be monitoring the blockchain and detect our UTXOs \u2212 after all, they provided us with the key_recovery_remote xpub, so they can scan for UTXOs containing pubkeys derived from key_recovery_remote . They will be able to learn about our financial history, even before the timelock expires, and even if we never utilized their service.\n\nRemark: Taproot trees can eliminate this privacy problem for certain policies, but this isn\u2019t always the case and requires careful evaluation based on the specific policy.\n\nStep four: blind the third party \ud83d\ude48\n\nIn order to prevent the recovery service from learning about our financial history, instead of using the pubkey they communicate to us, we can use a blind xpub technique explained by mflaxman in detail here. In short, instead of using key_recovery_remote in our policy, we choose four 31-bit random numbers a , b , c , d (the blinding factors), and we use the following BIP-32 derived pubkey:\n\nkey_recovery_remote_blind = key_recovery_remote/a/b/c/d\n\nIt\u2019s crucial that we also add key_recovery_remote , and the blinding factors a , b , c and d to our backup, for future reference.\n\nIf we ever need to use the recovery service, then we will reveal a , b , c , d to them. Until then, they have no way of discovering that keys derived from their key_recovery_remote are being published on the blockchain: the number of possible combinations for the 4 blinding factors is 2^(31*4) = 2^124 , which makes it impossible to bruteforce them all.\n\nStep five: too many hot keys can burn you \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe succeeded in making our software wallet unbackdoorable. However, we introduced a different problem: both spending conditions use a locally-generated, hot key that is not verified by the hardware wallet. Therefore, if the host machine is compromised, it might trick you into registering the policy using the pubkeys key_client and key_recovery_local , but put random, unrelated private keys in our backup (remember, the hot keys are part of our backup!).\n\nThat would basically make any funds sent to the wallet unspendable, as nobody controls the private keys necessary to sign.\n\nThere are a few solutions to solve this problem:\n\nDuring onboarding, after printing our backup on paper, we can use a separate device to verify that the private and public hot keys on the backup indeed match. This approach would eliminate the problem, as we would be certain we have all the required keys needed for reconstruction and signing.\n\nWe can add another spending condition with an even longer timelock (9 months, 38880 blocks) that only requires a key_ledger_failsafe from the hardware device. In this way, in the absolute worst-case scenario where everything else fails, we fall back to the security of a single signing device. In normal operations, we would never let the first timelock expire, thus, the second timelock also won\u2019t expire!\n\nWith the second approach, the final policy would look like this\n\nor(\n\nand(pk(key_ledger), pk(key_client)),\n\nor(\n\nand(older(25920),\n\nand(pk(key_recovery_local), pk(key_recovery_remote_blind))\n\n),\n\nand(older(38880), pk(key_ledger_failsafe))\n\n),\n\n)\n\nThis software wallet configuration satisfies all the security properties that we claimed at the beginning. Moreover, it offers a recovery path in case the main spending keys key_ledger are lost. A nice feature to have!\n\nOnboarding to the unbackdoorable software wallet\n\nWhat would the user experience for a wallet using such a complex policy look like? Here\u2019s a brief overview:\n\nThe user opens the software wallet and starts creating a new account.\n\nThe software wallet prompts the user to connect their signing device and retrieves the xpubs for key_ledger and key_ledger_failsafe .\n\nand . The software wallet autonomously generates the key_client hot key.\n\nThe software wallet obtains key_recovery_remote from a co-signing service or allows the user to specify a key in another manner. Optionally, it computes the key_recovery_remote_blind using the blinding technique mentioned previously.\n\nfrom a co-signing service or allows the user to specify a key in another manner. Optionally, it computes the using the blinding technique mentioned previously. The software wallet generates a policy backup containing the precise miniscript policy, all the xpubs, and the extended private key for the key_client hot key. This backup is securely stored (for instance, printed on paper or saved on a separate device).\n\nhot key. This backup is securely stored (for instance, printed on paper or saved on a separate device). Finally, the software wallet instructs the user to register the policy on the device. The user cross-checks the backup (on paper or any medium other than the screen controlled by the software wallet).\n\nThe software wallet manages most of the above steps, making the user\u2019s involvement not more burdensome than the expected effort needed today to set up a multisignature wallet.\n\nThe onboarding should just require a few minutes once a good UX is built for it. Once complete, the software wallet can provide a user experience very similar to that of a typical single-signature wallet. This is how miniscript will change everything: by disappearing from the user\u2019s sight!\n\nTaproot improvements\n\nLedger supports miniscript since version 2.1.0 of the Bitcoin app, released in March. While support for receiving to and spending from taproot addresses was enabled since the taproot softfork in November 2021, we are now putting the finishing touches on the next step of the roadmap: miniscript support for taproot.\n\nTaproot will have a huge impact on the usability of the approaches presented in this article. If the primary spending path is a single-key spending condition, the existence of recovery spending paths will be undetectable on the blockchain unless they\u2019re utilized. This will greatly improve privacy by completely eliminating any fingerprints for the standard spending path. Furthermore, it improves scalability, as the standard spending path becomes as cost-efficient to spend as possible. This means no additional cost will be incurred due to the presence of recovery paths, unless they\u2019re used. This is a significant upgrade from SegWit transactions, which require publishing the entire script, including all spending conditions, during any spend.\n\nFinally, more advanced protocols like MuSig2 (recently standardized) and FROST will supercharge the taproot keypath. Built on Schnorr signatures, these protocols allow to create a single aggregate pubkey that can be used to represent an n-of-n multisignature or a k-of-n threshold scheme. This would allow the use of the taproot keypath even in cases that today are more commonly represented with specific multisig scripts.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis article explores a small (but important) niche of the vast design space that miniscript unleashes for software wallets.\n\nWe showed how miniscript can be used to create an \u201cunbackdoorable\u201d software wallet, while also adding an additional recovery path that allows to prevent disastrous key losses. While hardware signing devices cannot enforce the anti-backdoor security model, by supporting miniscript they enable software wallets that do exactly that!\n\nBy cleverly utilizing a combination of multisignature schemes, timelocks, blind xpubs, and hot keys, we\u2019ve demonstrated a secure wallet configuration that balances security, privacy, and robustness.\n\nMoreover, we argued that this is possible without negatively impacting the user experience, as the complexity of the setup does not translate to a great additional UX burden.\n\nWe are excited for the possibilities that miniscript will unlock for the next generation of bitcoin self-custody."

        "content": "Key takeaways\n\nThe amount of Bitcoin used for illicit activity has decreased drastically over the last two years.\n\nCriminals are beginning to favor stablecoins for their accessibility and ubiquity.\n\nPonzi schemes remain a threat in the Web3 space.\n\nBitcoin is no longer the cryptocurrency of choice for criminals, according to Web3 crime trends outlined in a presentation during EthCC in Paris.\n\nTara Annison, former head of technical crypto advisory at Elliptic, delved into the world of crypto-related crime, highlighting shifting trends in the cryptocurrencies being used for money laundering and illicit activities.\n\nUnpacking insights from Web3 crime insights from Elliptic, Chainalysis and TRM Labs, Annison highlighted a shift away from criminals using BTC in illicit schemes to stablecoins and other cryptocurrency tokens.\n\nAccording to the speaker, criminals prefer using dollar-denominated assets, like USDC Coin (USDC), as they are easily accessible and can be laundered through decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nPonzi schemes remain prevalent in the industry, with nearly $8 billion worth of funds stolen from unsuspecting users in 2022.\n\nCriminals are also becoming increasingly more savvy using a variety of cryptocurrency cross-chain bridges, DEXs and mixing services in an effort to avoid blockchain analytics firms\u2019 detection.\n\nA Stable Option for Criminals\n\nA key takeaway from Annison\u2019s presentation was the role that stablecoins are playing in the world of Web3 crimes.\n\nThe accessibility of stablecoins and their ubiquity across DEXs and centralized exchanges makes these assets an easy choice to quickly move funds around. Annison said digital assets\n\nthat are dollar-denominated feel \u201cmore accessible\u201d which criminals use as a target point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also super easy to launder through DEXs. There\u2019s deep liquidity, really good volume, so that\u2019s pretty worrying.\u201d\n\nThe caveat of the increased use of stablecoins like USDC is the ability for issuers like Circle to freeze blacklisted tokens associated with hacks or thefts before criminals are able to cash out the stablecoins to fiat currencies.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is an increased number of accounts with USDC being blacklisted, and these are frozen funds that the criminals now can\u2019t access.\u201d\n\nFeels Like the 80s\n\nPonzi schemes have been part and parcel of the cryptocurrency space dating back to the early years after Bitcoin\u2019s inception. As Annison highlighted, scams are still prevalent and continually account for major losses.\n\n\u201cIt might feel a bit 80s, but they reign supreme. In 2022 we saw $7.8 billion worth of funds stolen from users in the space from ponzis and pyramids. The ten largest of these schemes accounted for about 54%. Ponzis and pyramids tend to get really big and dominate.\u201d\n\nAnnison highlighted Forsage and Trade Coin Club, the latter of which was eventually charged by the SEC . Trade Coin Club raised more than 82,000 BTC from 100,000 investors globally over a two year period. The SEC also charged eleven individuals responsible for running Forsage for operating an illegal pyramid scheme that raised over $300 million from users.\n\nA New Type of Criminal\n\nThe presentation also suggested that criminals are becoming more sophisticated in laundering stolen funds by using chain swapping and asset swapping techniques, aiming to evade blockchain analytics firms\u2019 detection.\n\n\u201cCriminals employ chain swapping and asset hoping to throw off blockchain analytics firms and evade detection, making it harder to trace stolen funds.\u201d\n\nAnnison also highlighted an interesting correlation between the number of scams in the industry and prevailing cryptocurrency market conditions. Scams in the cryptocurrency space have decreased due to the falling market prices, as fewer new investors are attracted, making it less profitable for criminals.\n\nTerrorists Using Tron, USDT\n\nAnnison also touched on sanctions evasion and terrorist financing, suggesting that terrorists are increasingly using crypto to bypass international financial barriers\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies are being used for sanctions evasion and terrorist financing, with Tron and USDtt being favored by terrorist organizations.\u201d\n\nAnnison also noted that some sanctioned nations have turned to Bitcoin mining in an effort to bypass sanctions. She highlighted reports and data from 2021 that estimated that 4.5% of all Bitcoin mining was carried out in Iran, with the proceeds used to evade sanctions.\n\nThreats From All Sides\n\nThe popularity of various metaverse platforms has also led to an element of criminality creeping in.\n\nPhishing attacks, NFT theft, wallet tainting, and augmented reality hacks have all become commonplace, according to Annison, presenting unique challenges for the sector to tackle with users\u2019 reputations and security at risk.\n\nOverall, the cryptocurrency sector continues to face a range of criminal activities, demanding increased vigilance and security measures to protect users and combat illicit activities."

        "content": "Today, paperwork was filed in the case of Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan (also known by her rap name Razzlekhan) for their role in laundering the more than 120,000 Bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex in 2016, suggesting the couple will plead guilty in a hearing scheduled for August 3rd. The stolen Bitcoin was valued around $70 million at the time of the theft, but worth over $4 billion at the time of their arrest in February 2022.\n\nAs we covered at the time, U.S. authorities were able to recover over 94,000 of the stolen Bitcoin following a joint investigation by the FBI, IRS-CI, and HSI. On August 9th 2022, in a previously unreported set of transactions, U.S. authorities recovered an additional 12,267 Bitcoin directly from the wallets of the initial theft. And on November 18th 2022, U.S. authorities recovered a further 1,155 Bitcoins. On January 5th, an additional 2.5 Bitcoins was recovered. The second, third, and fourth recoveries bring the amount recovered by U.S. authorities to over 108,068 Bitcoin.\n\nThe arrest and seizure, along with today\u2019s filing, represent another major victory for law enforcement in the fight against cryptocurrency-based crime. We\u2019ve written previously about how important it is for law enforcement to develop the ability to seize criminally-obtained cryptocurrency, and published a guide last year on how cryptocurrency businesses and law enforcement can work together to facilitate seizures. The Bitfinex investigation is a great example of this collaboration.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll explore how the husband-and-wife duo\u2019s money laundering strategy evolved in the years following the hack, and tell you more about how law enforcement cracked the case.\n\nTracking Bitfinex\u2019s stolen funds\n\nWe constructed the Chainalysis Reactor graph below based on the publicly-available DOJ indictment describing how Lichtenstein and Morgan moved the Bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex. While the information provided in the indictment wasn\u2019t enough to trace the movements of funds to every cryptocurrency service mentioned, the graph below shows how the couple\u2019s money laundering strategy evolved over time. We should also note that while not all of these businesses meet the conventional definition of an exchange, the DOJ indictment refers to all of them as Virtual Currency Exchanges (VCEs) and anonymizes them with simple, numbered labels (VCE 1, VCE 2, etc.), which we\u2019ll also use here.\n\n\n\nThe laundering of the Bitfinex funds had five distinct components, some of which were carried out in overlapping time periods, involving several different cryptocurrency businesses.\n\nComponent 1: The theft\n\nFirst, we see the initial theft: In a series of 2,075 transactions taking place in August 2016, the hacker moved 120,000 Bitcoin from Bitfinex to a wallet we labeled \u201cBitfinex.com Stolen Funds.\u201d Most of the funds never left that wallet. Directly above the hacker\u2019s wallet, we see that those funds were seized by law enforcement and moved to a new wallet nearly six years later in February 2022.\n\nComponent 2: Using a darknet market as a mixer\n\nIn January 2017, Lichtenstein and Morgan moved a large portion of the funds to the now-defunct darknet market AlphaBay, which the couple essentially used as a mixer by depositing the stolen Bitcoin and withdrawing equivalent amounts. Some funds moved to AlphaBay directly from the initial theft wallet, while others were moved there through intermediary wallets.\n\nComponent 3: Movements to VCEs and first cashouts\n\nSoon after that, Lichtenstein and Morgan moved funds from AlphaBay to four cryptocurrency exchanges, which the indictment refers to as VCEs 1-4. The information provided in the indictment only allows us to show movements to VCEs 1 and 4 on the graph above, but the movements to VCEs 2 and 3 likely look similar. Lichtenstein and Morgan created several different accounts using fake identities at these exchanges to receive the Bitcoin laundered through AlphaBay \u2014 in at least some cases, compliance teams at the exchanges were able to detect that the accounts likely belonged to the same person, for instance due to similarities in the email addresses used to register them and overlaps in the IP addresses used to access the accounts. Some of the exchanges froze the accounts due to this suspicious activity, as well as Lichtenstein and Morgan\u2019s inability to verify their identities or the source of the funds.\n\nComponent 4: Mixer usage and more VCEs\n\nBy 2019, AlphaBay had been taken down by law enforcement, so Lichtenstein and Morgan needed a new money laundering method. They began sending funds to a popular mixer, and then on to more VCEs (VCEs 5-10 in the indictment) where they swapped the Bitcoin for other assets, including Monero. Additionally, the pair sent some funds to a precious metals seller via a merchant services provider (labeled BTC PSP 1) in order to swap their cryptocurrency for gold. The indictment details how Lichtenstein and Morgan in some instances attempted to convince exchange representatives that their Bitcoin came from payment for advertising services, even creating a shell corporation to sell the story.\n\nComponent 5: Funds exchanged for cash at VCE 7\n\nFinally, in 2020 and 2021, Lichtenstein and Morgan were able to convert more funds into fiat currency at VCE 7 and move them into a U.S. bank account. The pair was also able to buy gift cards for Walmart and other businesses at VCE 10 \u2014 a specialized service devoted to crypto-for-gift card trades rather than a conventional cryptocurrency exchange \u2014 using the Bitcoin they\u2019d moved to VCE 10 previously.\n\nBlockchain analysis and traditional police work solved this case\n\nIn the end, the gift card purchases described above provided crucial clues in the investigation. After tracing the initial movements of cryptocurrency, investigators discovered that a personal wallet address beginning with 36B6mu, which had received over $1 million worth of Bitcoin associated with the Bitfinex hack, provided funding for the account at VCE 10 used to purchase gift cards. Agents discovered that the Walmart gift card specifically was redeemed through Walmart\u2019s iPhone app under an account in Heather Morgan\u2019s name. That enabled agents to get a search warrant for Lichtenstein and Morgan\u2019s home and cloud storage accounts, where they found files containing details of the cryptocurrency addresses used to move the stolen funds \u2014 including their private keys \u2014 along with the false information used to open accounts at cryptocurrency exchanges and plans to acquire fake passports. That discovery enabled investigators to trace the flow of funds in its entirety.\n\nThis case illustrates how blockchain analysis combined with traditional financial investigation techniques can empower law enforcement to solve cryptocurrency-related crime, win convictions, and seize stolen funds \u2014 in this case, over $3 billion worth at the time of arrest. We commend the agents at IRS-CI, FBI, and HSI who conducted this investigation, and look forward to working with our customers in the public sector to prevent further theft and abuse of crypto assets.\n\n\n\nThis website contains links to third-party sites that are not under the control of Chainalysis, Inc. or its affiliates (collectively \u201cChainalysis\u201d).

        "title": "Web3 Gamer: Earn Bitcoin in Minecraft, BGA's 50/50 gender split, Oath of Peak hot take - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Minecraft gets the Bitcoin treatment\n\nIt seems like Minecraft has been around since the invention of computers, and there is a reason for that. Along with its official free updates, which provide extra content, the Minecraft ecosystem has an incredibly active community, helping it stay up to date. Thanks to the game\u2019s open-ended gameplay, there is tons of community-built content available to enjoy.\n\nHave you finished the standard content of the game? Then why not relive the industrial revolution with custom-built mods? Or enter a competition to see who can build a construction first against hundreds of others? There is a server for that. Pokemon in Minecraft? Pixelmon!\n\nAnd if you want to earn Bitcoin in Minecraft? Welp, you can even do that now.\n\nPlayers can earn Bitcoin in Minecraft with the partnership between Zebedee and Satlantis. (Zebedee)\n\nA community-operated Minecraft server by the name of \u201cSatlantis\u201d has integrated Zebedee\u2019s gaming tech that lets players earn Bitcoin by completing in-game quests inspired by real-life BTC mining. Players in the server can join in-game mining pools, collect ASICs (popular hardware tailored for Bitcoin mining) and increase their hash rate to win block rewards. What a cool way to educate traditional gamers on the basics of Bitcoin!\n\nPlayers can withdraw their earnings to Zebedee\u2019s app, where they can spend their gains on other games made by the company or move them to exchanges that support Bitcoin\u2019s layer-2 Lightning Network.\n\n@Minecraft, meet #Bitcoin \ud83d\udfe7\ud83e\udde1\n\n\n\nIntroducing @PlaySatlantis, where you can earn real bitcoin in the world's most popular game.\n\n\n\nAll powered by the #ZEBEDEEapi\n\n\n\n\ud83e\uddbe\u26a1Supercharge your creation w/ the power of Bitcoin & get started w/ ZEBEDEE for free today:https://t.co/PRAH5i4EVM pic.twitter.com/WBDwepIJg3 \u2014 ZEBEDEE (@zebedeeio) July 10, 2023\n\nDon\u2019t get your hopes up for buying a Lambo with your earnings from building pixelated wonders. The server will give out a total of 1 million satoshis \u2014 equal to one hundred millionth of a BTC \u2014 per week. That\u2019s around $300 per week divided by God-only-knows how many people. While it isn\u2019t much, it\u2019s a start that could become a trend.\n\nThe Bitcoin-friendly integration is an unofficial one, and neither Satlantis nor Zebedee is affiliated with the Minecraft developer Mojang Studios. The studio itself is pretty down on Web3, having previously banned Minecraft NFT integrations. Time will show how this integration fairs against the ban.\n\nBlockchain Game Alliance ramps up diversity efforts\n\nDiversity is a surprisingly new topic in the world of video games. Most major publishers had not even released a diversity report as recently as 2021. In 2022 Activision Blizzard gave itself five long years to meet its goal of 50% women and non-binary employees.\n\nMembers of the Blockchain Game Alliance, a key organization promoting Web3 and blockchain gaming, voted to install a gender-balanced board, with three men and three women. And the newly elected BGA board of 2023 is made up of all new faces.\n\nBlockchain Game Alliance 2023 board members. (BGA)\n\nThey are Leah Callon-Butler, director of consulting firm Emfarsis; Yasmina Kazitani, chief marketing and partnerships officer at Interverse; Christina Macedo, co-founder and chief operating officer at Ready gg; Hideaki Uehara, director of business development at Square Enix; Mariano Rubinstein, CEO and co-founder at Sura Gaming; and Alex Kosloff, head of business development at Altura.\n\nAs an avid gamer, I will be watching with interest to see if the make-up of the new board can help progress and innovation across the Web3 gaming space.\n\nSega not a fan of P2E but developing a blockchain game\n\nThe makers of all-time favorite franchises Sonic and Yakuza have had an on-again, off-again relationship with blockchain technology. Sega announced plans for NFTs as play-to-earn (P2E) rewards last year. Later, they stepped off the gas after a backlash from fans, who considered the initiative a money grab.\n\nThis year, Sega is also walking both sides of the street. Shuji Utsumi, co-chief operating officer at Sega, called blockchain games \u201cboring\u201d and said the Japanese gaming giant wouldn\u2019t be using its biggest titles in blockchain gaming projects.\n\nHowever, Sega has announced a partnership with Line Next to bring its classic games to GAME DOSI, a Web3-friendly blockchain gaming platform. In light of this announcement, Utsumi clarified that investing in Web3 projects is within the company\u2019s strategy but that they don\u2019t intend to be a Web3 company but rather a \u201cWeb 2.5\u201d one.\n\nLINE NEXT partners with SEGA to license and bring a classic game to the Web3 gaming platform GAME DOSI. (LINE)\n\nAs everyone\u2019s aware, the mainstream gaming community is unenthusiastic about blockchain games and sees them as a temporary trend fueled by hype and speculation. Players are concerned about money grabs and the short lifespans of Web3 games, so it\u2019s understandable Sega doesn\u2019t want to put its big titles in an area where it has little-to-no experience.\n\nWhile some skepticism is warranted, it doesn\u2019t mean blockchain technology won\u2019t ever find its footing in the gaming industry. Multi-billion-dollar tech companies are aware of the possibilities Web3 gaming brings and know the importance of getting in on the ground floor.\n\nSega\u2019s decision to test the water with its smaller IPs is a thoughtful and measured approach that respects its legacy while navigating the uncharted terrain of Web3 gaming.\n\nStudio\u2019s $15M funding from Binance Labs for Web3 dino game\n\nBinance\u2019s venture capital and incubator arm Binance Labs has invested $15 million in Web3 gaming startup Xterio. The company labels itself as a \u201cfree-to-play-and-own\u201d game developer and publisher, meaning the games are free to play, and players are able to earn and keep NFTs. In August last year, it raised $40 million in funding from investors, including FunPlus, XPLA and now-extinct FTX Ventures.\n\nXterio seems to have a lot of experience on the gaming front, with Web2 gaming industry veterans on its founding executive team from companies including Ubisoft, Krafton and NetEase. There are 11 games in its repertoire, ranging from Age of Dino \u2014 a massively multiplayer online 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) strategy game that features dinosaurs \u2014 to Overworld, a cross-platform sandbox RPG with anime-inspired graphics.\n\nXterio is developing an \u201cemotion engine for AI,\u201d with an aim to enhance player immersion by equipping game characters with realistic and dynamic emotional responses \u2014 The Matrix and the whole AI takes-control scenario were way ahead of their time.\n\nOverworld promotional art. (Xterio)\n\nThe company uses AI very actively as they host an AI toolkit for developers and are creating a digital companion game called AIpal which is entering its beta phase later this year.\n\nHot take \u2014 Oath of Peak\n\nThe undeniable success of Genshin Impact \u2014 a Chinese MMORPG with cute graphics and fast-paced action that was released on virtually every platform except Casio Scientific Calculator \u2014 sparked off a trend of introducing every possible bit of Chinese mythology to Western audiences among developers.\n\nOath of Peak promotional art. (Oath of Peak)\n\nOath of Peak, an action MMORPG game that diversifies with its Web3 elements, seems to capitalize on that itch. Available on iOS and Android platforms as a free download, the game offers an epic world that\u2019s easy to get familiar with, thanks to its cute graphics.\n\nSimilar to other massively multiplayer games, players can pick from five different classes with fully customizable avatars. The game offers melee, assassin, ranger, mage and support characters \u2014 nothing groundbreaking.\n\nWith the recently-added English language support, it wasn\u2019t hard to find my way around the colorful island. After completing some quests, I realized one cool thing about the game: it doesn\u2019t shove its Web3 features at the player. Sure, the game has NFT monsters and a utility token that\u2019s exchangeable with in-game currency, but it doesn\u2019t become prominent until after players are invested in the game in terms of time and effort.\n\nIf you are in the market to check some new games with familiar mechanics, it\u2019s worth taking a look at Oath of Peak, now available globally via app stores or its APK. It\u2019ll only take 15-20 minutes for you to understand whether it\u2019s a game for you or not anyway.\n\nMore from Web3 gaming space:\n\n\u2014 Eyeball Games, led by the team behind Miniclip\u2019s 8 Ball Pool, has announced the launch of their blockchain-based mobile game, Eyeball Pool, on the Immutable platform in early 2024.\n\n\u2014 Polygon Labs\u2019 president, Ryan Wyatt, is transitioning to an advisory role after over a year with the company. Polygon\u2019s chief legal officer, Marc Boiron, will succeed Wyatt as the new CEO.\n\n\u2014 MetaGalaxy Land introduced the pre-alpha version of its metaverse platform, which utilizes Unreal Engine 5.\n\n\u2014 Major League Baseball became one of the first professional sports leagues to own a virtual world.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has once again fallen into familiar territories, trading below the $30,000 mark, with investors closely monitoring its subsequent price trajectory. In the coming weeks, the asset\u2019s valuation could be significantly influenced by upcoming macroeconomic news, such as the Federal Reserve interest rate decision.\n\nIn this line, according to prominent pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst FieryTrading on TradingView, in a post on July 22, investors should expect increased Bitcoin volatility this weekend. However, he remains optimistic about the long-term bullish sentiment for the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nHe noted that despite Bitcoin\u2019s failure to break through the $31,000 position, the long-term bullish trend remains intact.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\n\u201cEvery time that this indicator flashes green (= low volatility), the market will make a big move in the near future. The market switches between two periods: periods of contraction (now) and periods of expansion (volatility),\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision indicates that the market might be awaiting potentially increased volatility, which has also affected traditional financial products.\n\nElsewhere, another analysis posted on July 22 by Tolberti suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s recent price movement point to a possible bullish breakout. According to the analysts, Bitcoin is showing a bullish pennant pattern on the daily chart after a month of consolidation.\n\nHe predicted a potential breakout to around $34,000 based on the 0.618 Fibonacci extension. A pullback may follow, but an uptrend to $39,000 is expected later.\n\nAt the same time, he pointed out that traders should be cautious, as a breakdown could lead to a drop to $21,000, and taking advantage of a possible breakdown with short positions is being considered.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nFurthermore, he suggested that the bullish stand on Bitcoin emanated from the fact that several altcoins are showing signs of a possible breakout in the coming days.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent underperformance\n\nIt is worth noting that Bitcoin\u2019s recent underperformance is concerning for some market participants, especially given the presence of significant catalysts. The cryptocurrency market was initially boosted by the news of financial giants like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) filing for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which briefly lifted Bitcoin above $30,000 in June.\n\nAdditionally, the pro-crypto ruling in the Ripple case saw Bitcoin reach its highest value of the year. However, despite these positive developments, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain its high prices.\n\nOne of the contributing factors to this struggle is the ongoing regulatory uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies, which continue to exert downward pressure on prices. In general, the crypto market has been relatively quiet, indicating a lack of positive momentum.\n\nWhile long-term holders of Bitcoin may remain confident in the cryptocurrency, their influence alone is not enough to sustain high prices.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is striving to maintain its position above the $29,000 level, avoiding a free fall. As of press time, the asset was trading at $29,897, experiencing a decline of over 1% in the past seven days.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAccording to technical analysis, the one-day gauges retrieved from TradingView indicate neutrality. A summary of the gauges recommends a \u2018neutral\u2019 sentiment score of 9, while the moving averages indicate a \u2018sell\u2019 rating of 6. On the other hand, oscillators also align with the \u2018neutral\u2019 sentiment, registering a score of 8.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nOverall, Bitcoin\u2019s current underlying possible trigger is the upcoming Fed policy.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s six-year range inside a rising channel has drawn the attention of a curious but optimistic analyst. Previewing the price chart shows that the coin has been in range over the years, capturing all of its volatility. Despite occasional dumps and pumps, the structure is yet to be broken.\n\nBy the time the screenshot was shared on July 21, Bitcoin was trading in the lower part of the rising channel, skirting the support trend line, an indicator that prices have been generally lower in recent months. The rejection of lower lows and bounce from the support trend line, the analyst says, is bullish and squarely puts back bulls in contention.\n\nBitcoin To $175,000?\n\nAccording to the trader\u2019s assessment, a breakout above the upper resistance level at around $32,000 could potentially trigger a new bull run that may see the world\u2019s most valuable cryptocurrency retest highs of the rising channel at $175,000, a level that upbeat HODLers can mark as a feasible target.\n\nStill, considering the volatility in crypto, this bullish forecast cannot be dismissed. To illustrate, the last bull run drove Bitcoin prices from sub-$10,000 to peaks of $69,000 in less than two years. Therefore, if Bitcoin bulls push above $32,000, a price level that the analyst claim is important, it could be a bullish signal that may be the beginning of another leg up in the resumption of the bullish formation set in motion between 2020 and 2021.\n\nBitcoin is trading below the $30,000 level at spot rates with resistance at $31,800. Despite the general optimism across the board, bulls are yet to breach July 2023 highs as prices consolidate.\n\nHalving And ETF Approval As Tailwinds?\n\nSpecific triggers for the next run are unknown for now. Even so, considering past cycles, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event may provide the impetus for a leg up toward 2021 highs at $69,000. Besides, traders are closely monitoring how the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the United States progresses.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected several spot Bitcoin ETF applications in the past. However, the involvement of BlackRock has been received positively, lifting prices in the past few weeks. BlackRock is the world\u2019s largest asset manager, managing trillions.\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF would ease institutional investors\u2019 involvement in the sphere, potentially driving demand and lifting prices. Most importantly, a Bitcoin ETF legitimizes Bitcoin as an investment asset. Bitcoin is the most dominant crypto asset, and complex derivatives instruments, including exchange-traded products (ETPs), have been approved and listed in various markets across Canada, Europe, and Brazil.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "How the next Bitcoin halving might affect the price and miners? - The Financial Express",
        "content": "By Edul Patel\n\nIn the past few years, Bitcoin has experienced several cycles of price fluctuations, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts. Amidst these market movements, a crucial event known as Bitcoin Halving has taken place three times. But what exactly is Bitcoin Halving and what role does it play in the Bitcoin ecosystem?\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Halving?\n\n\n\nBitcoin Halving is a special event that happens about every four years in the Bitcoin system. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in total. Right now, around 19.5 million Bitcoins have been mined so far, of which 4 million has been irreversibly lost. 1.5 million BTC are yet to be mined. During the halving event, the rewards that Bitcoin miners get for their work are cut in half. This event has had an effect on the price of Bitcoin in the past. The next halving is scheduled to take place on 26th April 2024.\n\n\n\nHow does Bitcoin Halving Work?\n\n\n\nIn simple terms, Bitcoin validators are responsible for checking and approving Bitcoin transactions through a process called mining. When they successfully validate a block of transactions, they currently receive a reward of 6.25 BTC (Bitcoins), which is currently worth around $148,000. This acts as a good incentive for miners to continue validating and adding blocks of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\n\nThese blocks of transactions are added approximately every 10 minutes, and the Bitcoin system has a rule that reduces the mining reward by half after every 210,000 blocks are created. This reduction happens roughly every four years and is often accompanied by increased price changes and unpredictability in the value of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nAfter the fourth halving event, which is scheduled to happen next year, the mining rewards will decrease to 3.125 BTC per block.\n\n\n\nHistory of Bitcoin Halving and Price\n\n\n\nLooking back at the past, we can see that during previous halving events, the price of Bitcoin increases in anticipation and then after the event it stabilizes. In 2012, the price was $9 on October 26th and rose to $12.35 on the day of the halving on 28th Nov 2012.\n\nSimilarly, in 2016 the price of Bitcoin was $568 on June 28th and on the date of halving on July 9th, the price was $650.53. In 2020, on April 11th the bitcoin price was about $5884 and on the date of halving on 2020 11th May, the price was $8553. These historical patterns show that Bitcoin Halving has often led to a substantial increase in price before and in the following months. This demonstrates the potential impact that the halving event can have on the value of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWhy is Bitcoin Halving Important?\n\n\n\nThe reason for reducing the mining reward through Bitcoin Halving is to manage the creation of new Bitcoins and maintain their limited availability in the long run. By lowering the reward, Bitcoin Halving helps control inflation and ensures that the production of new Bitcoins happens at a slower pace. This event has important effects on the supply and potential value of Bitcoin, as well as on the miners who play a vital role in securing the network using their computers. Understanding Bitcoin Halving is crucial for grasping how the Bitcoin market works and the factors that impact its value over time.\n\nHow can Bitcoin Halving Impact the Miners?\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving event will reduce the mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block next year. This reduction in rewards may make mining less profitable for miners. Consequently, unless there is a significant increase in the price of Bitcoin, miners are likely to pause their investments in new mining hardware for the next few months. In some cases, miners may even shut down less efficient mining hardware because it fails to generate sufficient bitcoins to cover operational expenses.\n\n\n\nIn the short term, the decrease in mining resources is expected to result in a slower rate of Bitcoin creation. However, the Bitcoin network has an automatic mechanism to maintain a relatively constant rate of new bitcoin production. Every two weeks, the network adjusts the difficulty of the mining problem to ensure an average rate of approximately six blocks per hour. If blocks are being produced too slowly, the network lowers the difficulty level to widen the range of winning hash values. Conversely, if blocks are being created too quickly, the network increases the difficulty to make the mining problem more challenging and slow down block creation.\n\n\n\nMiners strive to make profits, and competition among miners helps maintain relatively stable profit margins over time. Therefore, if revenues from Bitcoin mining decrease by half, miners will likely spend approximately half the amount to produce those bitcoins. Since electricity is a major cost in Bitcoin mining, the reduction in block rewards should ultimately lead to a similar reduction in the electricity consumed by mining.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the halving event indirectly affects mining difficulty. As block rewards decrease, miners may find mining less profitable and decide to stop or reduce their mining activities. This reduction in overall computing power dedicated to mining prompts the network to adjust the difficulty level downwards. The aim is to make it easier to find the solution and maintain the desired rate of block creation.\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s important to note that the impact of the halving event on mining profitability can be offset by higher prices of Bitcoin. When the price of Bitcoin increases, the revenues earned from each block also rise. This, in turn, increases the amount of money miners are willing to invest in mining hardware and the electricity they consume during the process. Therefore, if the price of Bitcoin rises significantly, miners are incentivized to purchase more mining equipment and expand their operations, leading to an increase in electricity usage.\n\nThe author is co-founder and CEO, Mudrex\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n"

At one point, BTC even dropped to a one-month low of $29,500. Currently, BTC faces resistance at the $30,000 level and finds support at $29,600. Apart from Bitcoin, XRP and Ethereum have also experienced value declines. On a positive note, LINK's performance has managed to avoid a downturn. Furthermore, a notable development is the United States government introducing a new bill to regulate digital assets, potentially impacting the future of cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nShubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk, said, \u201cBTC, for another day, traded flat while altcoins registered some significant developments. LINK (+17.3 percent) is making a big move after launching its CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol). Good moves in other prominent DeFi tokens like MKR (+8.38 percent), SNX (+5.96 percent), and COMP (+5.29 percent) underline that the current market interest is around accumulating quality DeFi protocols before Bitcoin coves out of its tight range of trading.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, offered his take, \u201cThe overall market sentiment remains neutral even as prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum decreased. The macroeconomic factors and equity markets results have had little impact on user sentiment. Altcoins continue their popularity streak even amidst price volatility.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is currently hovering slightly above the important $29,500 support level, bolstered by a triple bottom pattern on the four-hour time frame. Technical indicators such as RSI (39) and MACD (-5) indicate bearish sentiment. The 50-day exponential moving average acts as resistance around $29,995. The likelihood of Bitcoin remaining bearish below $30,000 is high, with potential support at $28,900 if it breaks below $29,500. A bullish breakout could push it to $30,000 and even $30,500. If demand increases, a break of $30,450 could lead to a rally towards further resistance at $31,200. Watching the $29,500 level is vital as it could indicate a buying opportunity above or quick selling positions if breached.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe entire volume of the cryptocurrency market increased by an amazing 19.70 percent over the past day to reach an astounding $37.46 billion. Ripple's XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency, gained 6.8 percent, while native cryptocurrencies Cardano, Solana, ADA, and SOL surged over 6 percent, outpacing Bitcoin and Ether. With a value of $29,905.69, Bitcoin continues to play a significant role in this rollercoaster. These numbers demonstrate the potential of the cryptocurrency sector and its indisputable influence on the financial landscape, which presents opportunities and difficulties for both investors and enthusiasts.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cBitcoin is holding a key support above $30,000 with a record-breaking accumulation of 5,92,000 BTCs worth $17.8 billion at the $30,200 level as per Glassnode, suggesting that investors are confident that BTC will continue to hold above this level. However, BTC dominance is close to its 1-month low, as investors are shifting their focus to smaller, riskier tokens. One such token is XRP, which has surpassed Bitcoin in trading volume after a court ruling determined that it is not a security.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: https://t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
