        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is suing Coinbase (COIN) and Binance because it believes many cryptocurrencies traded on those exchanges are securities that should be registered with the US regulator.\n\nThere is one big exception: bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has been extremely clear. Bitcoin is not a security,\u201d Steven Lubka, managing director of Swan Bitcoin, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe\u2019re very, very confident that never changes.\u201d\n\nThat belief is encouraging investors to stick with the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency despite the industry turmoil triggered by new SEC lawsuits against the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world and the US.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) was up 5% Wednesday at 9:30 am New York time to $26,759, before settling back to $26,400 by noon. Its market share, a ratio of the coin's market capitalization over the total crypto market capitalization, rose 0.85% over the same period, suggesting crypto investors are seeking it out as a safe bet within the market.\n\nBitcoin is up 58% year to date, while still down by roughly the same amount from its November 2021 peak of $68,790.\n\nSome bitcoin proponents expressed their optimism on social media, suggesting their favorite digital asset could benefit amid the legal battles.\n\nCory Klippsten, an outspoken critic of the larger crypto ecosystem and CEO of bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin, tweeted a graphic of bitcoin\u2019s recovery this week and added a sarcastic: \u201cOh noes! Whatever is bitcoin going to do???!\u201d\n\nOh noes! The sh*tcoin casinos I mean \"tool manufacturers\" are f***ed whatever is Bitcoin going to do???!\n\n\n\nTick tock, next block. pic.twitter.com/uqnBs6ePfv \u2014 Cory Klippsten \ud83d\udd90\ufe0f Swan.com \ud83e\udda2 #Bitcoin (@coryklippsten) June 7, 2023\n\nPierre Rochard of bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) tweeted that Coinbase should \"pivot back to being focused on #Bitcoin.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTwitter co-founder Jack Dorsey then attached the Rochard comment to his Twitter feed and added a hundred points emoji.\n\nCoinbase does rely on bitcoin for roughly one-third of its trading volume and transaction revenue.\n\nThe Howey test\n\nThe SEC's framework for evaluating digital assets as securities relies on the so-called Howey Test. It can be linked back to a 1946 Supreme Court case dealing with tracts of Florida orange groves sold by W.J. Howey Co. and leased back to the company.\n\nThe Supreme Court labeled these leaseback deals as investment contracts, meaning they needed to be registered with the SEC.\n\nIt also defined what constitutes a security: \"an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others.\"\n\nBitcoin, its defenders say, doesn't meet that test. It wasn't created, they say, by entrepreneurs seeking profits via pre-listed private sales to larger institutional investors \u2014 as other digital coins have.\n\nIt was instead created by anonymous software developer Satoshi Nakamoto in January 2009 as an open-source concept.\n\n\"Satoshi never raised a single dollar and because he never raised a single dollar, there were no expectations of future profits in an investment contract,\" Lubka said.\n\nWhile there is no law declaring whether or not bitcoin is a security, SEC Chair Gary Gensler as well as former Chair Jay Clayton have indicated in numerous public comments they do not believe bitcoin is a security. Instead, most investors understand it to be a commodity such as gold or wheat.\n\n\"I\u2019m extremely confident that Bitcoin is going to remain a commodity and will not be labeled a security,\" Grant McCarty, co-executive director of advocacy group Bitcoin Policy Institute, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAbsolutely hilarious seeing all the shitcoiners and \u201cventure capitalists\u201d trying to crawl their way back to #Bitcoin. \u2014 Magoo PhD (@HodlMagoo) June 6, 2023\n\nThe SEC listed 19 different crypto tokens in its lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance that it considers securities, accounting for roughly 11% of crypto's total market capitalization. Those coins fell Wednesday.\n\nBNB (BNB-USD) was down 7.5%, Cardano's ADA (ADA-USD) was down 7%, Polygon's MATIC (MATIC-USD) token was down 4.8% while Solana's SOL token was down 4.2%.\n\nAfter falling 12% Tuesday, Coinbase's stock rose 2.8% at Wednesday's open.\n\nCustomers withdrew $105 million from Coinbase in the 24 hours after it was sued by the SEC, after losing $1.3 billion in the previous 24 hours, according to crypto data provider Nansen.\n\nBinance customers pulled $492 million and $1.4 billion in the two previous 24-hour periods.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "Swan Bitcoin appears to have been struggling as the company has moved to transfer all of its assets to two new custodians \u2014 even as its CEO harshly criticized other crypto exchanges in the wake of the SEC\u2019s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase this week.\n\nUsers of the bitcoin-only trading platform this week have reported significant outages that they say have prevented them from moving assets with ease. Fiat on- and off-ramp services were affected.\n\nThe company said in a statement posted on its website Wednesday that \u201call funds are being transferred\u201d to its qualified custodians, Fortress Trust and BitGo Trust Company. CEO Cory Klippsten confirmed this in an email to Blockworks in which he also noted that the company was migrating from Prime Trust and Fireblocks.\n\nThe US-based company\u2019s site also listed a number of service outages dating back to May 26.\n\nWhether the root cause of Swan\u2019s problems \u2014 which appear to span multiple weeks \u2014 could be attributed entirely to the custodian switch was not immediately clear.\n\nThe company told customers that the transfer of their assets to Fortress and BitGo commenced on May 26, coinciding with the outages. Swan said that the company \u201ccarefully weighed the pros and cons\u201d of moving all assets in one swoop, adding that it had reached a consensus that \u201cmoving at once will create the least amount of disruption for Swan clients.\u201d\n\nSwan\u2019s website on Wednesday separately said its \u201cbitcoin purchasing\u201d and \u201cACH Pull\u201d services were both \u201cunder maintenance.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommunication with clients has been constant and detailed,\u201d Klippsten told Blockworks Wednesday. He added that withdrawals of BTC and USD were available throughout the custodian migration via client service channels. The ability for users to withdraw via the website or app directly resumed Tuesday.\n\n\u2018Degraded performance\u2019 across business lines\n\nAt the same time, Swan\u2019s wire transfers, as well as its custody and trading business lines, were both operating under \u201cdegraded performance.\u201d The company on its website listed a \u201cmajor platform upgrade\u201d as being under way each day since May 30.\n\nSwan attributed its custodial switch to plans the company put in place in January. At the time, Klippsten wrote that his company had 100 full-time employees, or \u201cSwans,\u201d divided across five continents and cited its \u201crapid expansion into new products and markets.\u201d\n\nFrom its roots at a bitcoin (BTC) exchange, Klippsten\u2019s Swan has over the years rolled out a number of new bitcoin-only products.\n\nThose include support for both retail and institutional investors, including an advisory service designed to cater to registered investment advisers (RIAs). Swan has also played up its BTC-based retirement account services, as well as bitcoin maximalist job boards.\n\nBut Swan\u2019s Twitter account, as well as that of Klippsten, has been active this week reacting to the SEC\u2019s allegations against Binance and Coinbase for alleged securities violations and other charges.\n\nThe exchanges have denied wrongdoing.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe company hosted a Twitter Space about the lawsuits \u2014 which included \u201c#Bitcoin Not Crypto\u201d in the title.\n\nKlippsten called the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase an outcome that was \u201cobvious, inevitable and entirely self-inflicted\u201d in a Wednesday Twitter thread, calling out Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Balaji Srinivasan, a former chief technology officer at the exchange.\n\nCoinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said Tuesday that the SEC\u2019s actions amid the lack of US crypto regulations harms companies like Coinbase \u201cthat have a demonstrated commitment to compliance.\u201d\n\nCustodial migration \u201cnot 100% complete\u201d\n\nSome Swan users appeared confused as to the status of their services, Swan on its website site said it had put in place a number of measures to update customers on the status of their assets.\n\nThat included a new \u201csnapshot\u201d feature designed to provide a placeholder update of customer balances \u201cat the time of migration.\u201d The custodial switch was still not \u201c100% complete\u201d through 5 pm ET on Wednesday.\n\nCustomers could not, however, view the balance of their dollar holdings during the move. Swan told customers that the migration ought to be complete by June 11 \u2014 it started on May 26.\n\nOn Wednesday, \u201cself-service Bitcoin withdrawals\u201d remained unaffected by the outages, while \u201cinstant buys,\u201d as well as \u201cautomated savings plans\u201d and \u201cautomated withdrawals\u201d were not operational.\n\nKlippsten said he expected \u201cbuys\u201d to be available on Wednesday night or Thursday, adding that new user sign ups could resume by the weekend.\n\nSwan capped off its post by saying that the company would re-open in Texas in a \u201cplan to return by July or August.\u201d And the firm told customers that it\u2019s \u201cworking on bringing Swan services to New York\u201d within three to six months.\n\n\u201cStay tuned for an email announcement!\u201d Swan said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Economics of Bitcoin ATM market could hinder wider adoption - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "As the digital asset market continues to evolve, the use of cryptocurrency ATMs grows with it. Over the past decade, nearly 40,000 cryptocurrency ATMs have popped up worldwide.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) ATM service provider, Bitcoin of America, had carved out a slice of the market but recently closed shop in the United States State of Connecticut due to a lack of proper licensing.\n\nThe Connecticut Department of Banking (DoB) issued a cease and desist order against the company, accusing it of operating unlicensed crypto ATMs in the state. But the allegations didn\u2019t stop there; the firm was also accused of facilitating scams by allowing transactions related to fraudulent activities.\n\nIn response to the challenges, Bitcoin of America released a statement claiming it would immediately halt all of its operations in Connecticut. While the decision marked the end of the company\u2019s presence in the state, it also underscored the regulatory hurdles faced by crypto ATM operators, particularly in the United States.\n\nThe closure also sent ripples across the crypto community, leading many industry observers to question the long-term efficacy and utility of these machines.\n\nConnecticut closure explained\n\nDue to the nascency of the cryptocurrency industry, marrying digital currencies with conventional financial structures \u2014 as in the case of crypto ATMs \u2014 requires intricate regulatory supervision. This is particularly true in Connecticut, where the DoB oversees ATMs under the Money Transmission Act.\n\nThe act requires that any service involving the transfer of money, including the conversion of traditional currency to cryptocurrency, must secure a money transmitter license.\n\nOn May 22, the Connecticut DoB claimed that Bitcoin of America had not secured the necessary license to operate Bitcoin ATMs in the state. It further stated that four Connecticut Bitcoin ATM users were scammed out of tens of thousands of dollars via Bitcoin of America\u2019s kiosks.\n\nRecent: Grinding out a living: Can blockchain games really offer a sustainable income?\n\nThe DoB stated: \u201cBitcoin of America, following the consent order, compensated these consumers with a total of $86,000. After facing criminal charges, Bitcoin of America is in the process of ceasing its operations in Connecticut.\u201d\n\nIn a separate incident in March, state officials in Ohio seized 52 Bitcoin of America ATMs, as authorities suspected scammers were using the kiosks.\n\nOperating crypto ATMs is harder than it looks\n\nJason Grewal, chief legal officer for Web3 security firm Sys Labs, told Cointelegraph that running a crypto ATM involves much more than just acquiring a license.\n\nOperators in the U.S. must adhere to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules set by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, comply with the Bank Secrecy Act\u2019s Know Your Customer (KYC) norms, and conform to the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s requirements for reporting crypto transactions.\n\nIn Grewal\u2019s opinion, such complexities could play a significant role in the waning popularity of these machines. In March alone, a staggering 3,627 cryptocurrency ATMs went offline, marking the most significant monthly decrease in the history of crypto ATMs. He said:\n\n\u201cConsidering the shifting popularity of crypto ATMs, various factors seem to be at play. For one, the transaction fees imposed by these machines often exceed those on online exchanges, posing a deterrent for heavy users. Additionally, the necessity to satisfy complex regulations and licensing requirements can be challenging and potentially overshadow the perceived advantages of in-person crypto transactions.\u201d\n\nFurther tipping the scales away from crypto ATMs are alternatives like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.\n\nLower transaction costs, universal access, superior privacy and a broader range of supported cryptocurrencies make these projects increasingly compelling to many people. DeFi platforms also offer features such as staking, yield farming and borrowing \u2014 services typically absent from crypto ATMs.\n\nGrewal believes that moving forward, crypto ATM operators will have to innovate and change to better serve the evolving needs of their consumers.\n\nRobert Quartly-Janeiro, chief strategy officer for cryptocurrency exchange Bitrue, told Cointelegraph that four primary companies currently dominate the crypto ATM market, something which needs to change for the market to grow and adoption to increase.\n\nMoreover, he believes that the physical location of crypto ATMs is also a major factor when it comes to engaging customers. He added:\n\n\u201cUltimately, one of the key pillars for the mass adoption of crypto remains the ability to sell crypto for fiat currencies in-country. The landscape has changed slightly, so the need for crypto ATMs has changed economically, geographically, psychologically, as well as from an infrastructural standpoint.\u201d\n\nThe economics of crypto ATMs\n\nMost crypto ATMs in operation today run in collaboration with established companies like ChainBytes, LibertyX, CoinMe and others, which allow independent businesses to become \u201coperators,\u201d \u201cpartners,\u201d or \u201chosts\u201d for these machines.\n\nThe return on investment depends on several factors, including the location of the business (e.g., commercial district, high-traffic area); the number of daily transactions; the average transaction size; the total expected revenue from transaction fees; and the marketing strategy to promote the crypto ATM in question.\n\nAccording to crypto ATM firm Chainbytes, a single Bitcoin ATM can earn up to $3,000 monthly, with gross monthly revenues of $30,000.\n\nOperating a crypto ATM presents several challenges as well. Regulatory complexities require operators to navigate often unclear laws, obtain necessary licenses, and comply with AML and KYC regulations. Security risks, both physical and digital, necessitate robust protective measures, adding to high operational costs that include machine maintenance and cash management.\n\nThe inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies can also impact profitability, with significant value fluctuations potentially leading to financial losses. Operators must also maintain sufficient cryptocurrency and cash reserves to meet customer demand, as shortages could harm their reputation and business.\n\nWho\u2019s leading the global crypto ATM race?\n\nSince the first crypto ATM debuted in a Vancouver coffee shop in 2013, the sector has evolved dramatically. Today, there are around 35,000 machines globally, transforming how people interact with digital currencies.\n\nThe United States has the lion\u2019s share of crypto ATMs globally. Source: Coin ATM Radar\n\nThe U.S. houses roughly 30,000 crypto ATMs, accounting for 86% of all such machines worldwide.\n\nCanada\u2019s crypto ATM scene has also flourished over the last few years. As of Q1 2023, the country hosts 2,744 machines, while its European compatriot Spain boasts around 286 machines.\n\nDown under, Australia has also been making waves. After adding 99 ATMs in late 2022, it leapfrogged El Salvador and Poland to become the fourth-largest crypto ATM hub with around 473 kiosks.\n\nThe future of crypto ATMs\n\nDespite the many hurdles impeding the growth of the crypto ATM market, the space is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. The market \u2014 valued at $71.9 million in 2021 \u2014 is projected to rise to $5.45 billion by 2030.\n\nRecent: Tornado Cash 2.0: The race to build safe and legal coin mixers\n\nHowever, for the sector to thrive, it will be crucial for operating companies to obtain regulatory clarity. Physical and digital security measures must also be enhanced to protect the machines and the transactions they facilitate. This includes robust cybersecurity measures to prevent digital hacks and adequate physical security to deter theft attempts.\n\nFinally, efforts must be made to reduce the operational costs of running these machines. This could involve developing more cost-effective kiosks, optimizing cash management processes and exploring alternative business models. Thus, as we head into a future driven by crypto-enabled tech, it will be interesting to see how the future of the crypto ATM market continues to evolve and grow."

Ether strengthened 3.23%.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s crackdown on Coinbase signals a shift towards greater regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. This move could have significant implications for the future of cryptocurrency, as it may lead to increased scrutiny and oversight of digital assets,\u201d Kadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, told Forkast in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that regulatory compliance will become increasingly important for cryptocurrency businesses moving forward, as they seek to navigate an evolving landscape of laws and regulations.\u201d\n\nDogecoin was the day\u2019s biggest gainer, up 4.4% to US$0.06947, followed by Bitcoin.

Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 lost 1.82% decrease, and the Shenzhen Component Index dipped 0.%.\n\nInvestor sentiment was dampened by weak trade data from China that showed exports tumbled and imports fell less than expected in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nAdding to downbeat investor sentiment, the World Bank warned about the fragility of the global economy, saying that high interest rates could cause issues in lower income economies.

Gemini, a rival firm based in New York, is seeking a license in the United Arab Emirates. And Bittrex, an exchange in Seattle, has shut down its U.S. operations.\n\nAfter years of trying to shape federal regulation in the United States, a growing number of American crypto companies \u2014 particularly the exchanges where customers buy and sell digital tokens \u2014 are exploring plans to build their businesses abroad. They are expanding into new markets and weighing the possibility of leaving the country entirely.\n\nThe moves are a response to a growing law enforcement crackdown that has made the United States one of the strictest regulators of crypto in the world. On Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a long-anticipated lawsuit against Coinbase, arguing that the exchange was marketing securities without the proper registration. A day earlier, the S.E.C. sued the international crypto exchange Binance, seeking to bar its founder from the U.S. securities market."

        "content": "Bitcoin prices rose in Friday morning trading in Asia, but failed to break back above US$27,000 after a rollercoaster week in crypto markets following the lawsuits by U.S. securities regulators against the Binance and Coinbase exchanges. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies gained, with Polygon\u2019s Matic token leading the winners.\n\nTop 10 gain ground\n\nBitcoin strengthened 1.06% over the last 24 hours to US$26,551 at 7:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, making up some losses from earlier this week after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against two of the world\u2019s biggest exchanges, alleging dozens of of crypto tokens have been illegally offered and traded as unregistered securities. The world\u2019s largest crypto by market capitalization is now down 1.26% for the past seven days after sharper declines earlier in the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nEther climbed 1.1% to US$1,849, and logged a 0.98% weekly decline.\n\nPolygon\u2019s MATIC was the biggest gainer among the top 10, with a 2.69% rise, but it has lost 12.02% in value for the past week.\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB added 2.01% in the past 24 hours, the second-largest rise among the top 10, but is a big loser for the week, down 13.9%.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap edged up 0.35% to US$1.1 trillion in the 24 hours through to 8:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, while daily trading volume dropped 35.3% to US$25.9 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nIn a new court filing on Wednesday, the SEC said transactions involving several billions of dollars of customer funds moved through now-defunct Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank under accounts allegedly controlled by Binance officials, including chief executive Changpeng Zhao.\n\nSachin Verma, an accountant employed by the SEC, said in the filing that some of the funds were moved to accounts suspected to belong to offshore firms linked to Zhao and Binance, in various regions including the Seychelles, Lithuania and Kazakhstan.\n\nStory continues\n\nZhao tweeted on Thursday that this is \u201csimply false\u201d in response to a CoinDesk article that said US$12 billion of funds was sent to Zhao, citing the Wednesday filing.\n\n\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, Binance.US had in total roughly US$2 billion in user funds. This number in USD equivalent fluctuates a little as crypto prices change. And declining as users withdraw due to recent news,\u201d Zhao tweeted. \u201cAll user funds are accounted for, and never left the Binance.US platform (unless users withdraw themselves of course), ever.\u201d\n\nGordon Grant, co-head of trading at crypto brokerage Genesis Trading, said that this week\u2019s sweeping regulatory pronouncements \u201csaw crypto realized volatility begin to rear its head.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter seeming months of coiling in an ornery, reptilian rip-rap price action, the successive Monday and Tuesday swoon-soar tandem on the back of Binance and Coinbase headlines preempted consternation, head scratching and, if nothing else, a recognition that the asset class remains habitually prone to lurid gaps in price action,\u201d Grant said.\n\nIn an email, Le Shi, head of trading at Auros, a crypto market-making and algorithmic trading firm, said cryptocurrency trading volumes continue to \u201cplumb the depths\u201d last seen in the middle of the last crypto bear market.\n\nCoinShares, a European crypto investment firm, said in a Thursday report shared with Forkast that while the SEC lawsuits seem to carry more severe implications for Binance, the potential impact on Coinbase and the broader crypto industry is significant.\n\n\u201cThe charges insinuate that a majority of crypto assets should be categorized as securities, which would radically modify the regulatory landscape, potentially confining access to regulated Wall Street entities (assuming that they have the appetite once the litigation is over),\u201d CoinShares wrote.\n\nCoinShares added that the shift could potentially place the control of the crypto industry within the grasp of traditional financial institutions.\n\nNFT sales drop\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 1.07% to 3,219.65 in the 24 hours to 9:45 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index was down 4.59% for the week.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum fell 14.4% over the last 24 hours to US$13.72 million, and sales on the Bitcoin network dropped 9.34% to US$3.53 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s a] hard market to analyze right now,\u201d Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News, said on Friday.\n\n\u201cOn one hand I believe we\u2019ll see capitulation to the negative news, especially once the SEC files lawsuits against (NFT) projects, but at the same time, we are seeing bullish news from projects, art, among others, on an almost daily basis,\u201d Petscher added. \u201cI don\u2019t think the SEC\u2019s lawsuits have played a factor yet. They should soon.\u201d\n\nUncategorized Ordinals \u2013 recently popular Bitcoin Ordinals that are not part of an established collection \u2013 saw the largest sales in the past 24 hours with a 74.13% rise to US$1.54 million.\n\nThe Captainz, an Ethereum-based collection, recorded a 2.33% increase in sales to US$1.12 million, making it the second most sold collection in the past day, followed by Mythos chain-based DMarket\u2019s US$1.11 million daily sales.\n\nIn another development, crypto exchange Kraken has launched its NFT marketplace out of beta with over 250 collections.\n\nLuca Netz, the chief executive officer of intellectual property firm and NFT collection Pudgy Penguins, is set to launch a Web 3.0 licensing marketplace named Overpass as early as late June, according to a Thursday report by media firm NFT Now.\n\nPudgy Penguins is an Ethereum-based NFT collection of 8,888 unique digital assets. It is the 19th largest collection in all-time sales, with more than US$257 million traded, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nU.S. stock futures fall\n\nNew York Stock Exchange. Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures fell as of 10:10 a.m. in Hong Kong after the major U.S. stock indexes posted strong gains overnight. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 0.14%, and S&P 500 futures dipped 0.1%. Nasdaq Futures fell 0.1%.\n\nOvernight in the U.S., the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.02%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5%. The S&P 500 added 0.62%, hitting a new high for the year so far.\n\nIn macroeconomic developments, the U.S. Labor Department reported Thursday that the country\u2019s initial jobless claims totaled 261,000 for the week ended June 3. That was the highest weekly level for such claims since October 30, 2021.\n\nThe jobless claims pointing to a slowing of the economy are another factor suggesting the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s more than year-long hikes in interest rates are having an effect and may influence the Fed\u2019s decision-making on rates at its meeting on June 14.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 74.8% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged at next week\u2019s meeting, and a 25.2% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

And then, days later, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) went nuclear on Binance and then Coinbase , suing both of them, essentially on grounds that existing regulations are adequate and strongly suggesting these businesses simply are not allowed in the U.S. The takeaway here sure seems to be that the direction the political winds blow could determine crypto\u2019s viability in the country."

        "content": "Bitcoin might have displayed strength by quickly recovering from the $25,500 support level on June 6, but that doesn\u2019t mean that breaking above $27,500 will be an easy task.\n\nInvestors still expect stricter regulatory scrutiny after FTX\u2019s bankruptcy in November 2022, including the recent suits against Coinbase and Binance.\n\nA total of eight cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions have been undertaken by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the past six months. Some analysts suggested the SEC is attempting to redeem itself for failing to police FTX by taking action against the two leading exchanges.\n\nAdditionally, looking at a wider angle, investors fear that a global recession is imminent, which limits the upside of risk-on assets such as stocks, cryptocurrencies and emerging markets.\n\nThe eurozone entered a recession in the first quarter of this year, according to revised estimates from the region\u2019s statistics office, Eurostat, released June 8. Poor economic performance might limit the European Central Bank\u2019s ability to further increase interest rates to tackle inflation.\n\nBillionaire Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, said the U.S. is seeing stubbornly high inflation along with elevated real interest rates. Dalio warned of an excess debt offer amid a shortage of buyers, which is especially concerning since the U.S. government is desperate to raise cash after the debt ceiling was hit.\n\nRecent macroeconomic data has been mostly negative, especially after China announced a 4.5% decline in imports year over year on June 6. Furthermore, Japan posted a 0.3% quarter-over-quarter contraction in gross domestic product on June 7.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned amid the weaker global environment.\n\nBitcoin margin and futures favor bullish momentum\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because they allow investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nOKX, for instance, provides a margin-lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. Traders can increase their exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of a cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin-lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin-lending ratio spiked on June 5 after Bitcoin crashed by 7% to $25,500. Those traders were likely caught by surprise, as the indicator reached an impressive 62 favoring longs, which is highly unusual and unsustainable.\n\nThe OKX margin-lending ratio adjusted to 34 on June 6, as leveraged longs were forced to reduce their exposure and additional margin was likely deposited.\n\nInvestors should also analyze the Bitcoin futures long-to-short metric, as it excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets.\n\nExchanges\u2019 top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nBoth OKX\u2019s and Binance\u2019s top traders reduced their long-to-short ratios between June 7 and June 8, indicating a lack of confidence. More precisely, the ratio for OKX top traders declined to 0.78 on June 8 after peaking at 1.08 on June 7. Meanwhile, at crypto exchange Binance, the long-to-short ratio declined to 1.29 on June 8 from 1.35 on the previous day.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin rebound falters amid SEC crackdown on exchanges, raising chance of a BTC price capitulation\n\nOverall, Bitcoin bulls seem to be in a bad place, both from the worsening regulatory crypto environment and the unfolding global economic crisis.\n\nBitcoin derivatives markets indicate a low probability of the BTC price breaking above $27,500 in the short to medium term. In other words, Bitcoin\u2019s market structure is bearish, so a $25,500 support retest is the most probable outcome.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "A public-private partnership in El Salvador pledging to pump $1 billion into creating a Bitcoin (BTC) mining farm has received its first $250 million. This first release of funds kickstarts a 241-megawatt (MW) power generation park in the country\u2019s Metap\u00e1n region.\n\nVolcano Energy, the company behind the site, said the funds would go toward developing the power generation park using solar and wind energy, which will eventually power the Bitcoin mining operation. Volcano Energy chairman Max Keiser took to Twitter on June 7 to announce the news.\n\n.@Volcano_Energy receives the first $250M of a $1 billion commitment that kickstarts 241 MW\u2019s of #Bitcoin mining in El Salvador.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe Got The Power\u201d https://t.co/j2wE6UJq0O pic.twitter.com/db3PZvFo4q \u2014 Max Keiser, sr. bitcoin advisor pres. Bukele (@maxkeiser) June 7, 2023\n\nBitcoin mining uses high-power computers hooked up to a global network, using massive amounts of electricity in the process. The energy-intensive practice has come under fire from environmentalists, who are concerned that it exacerbates forest loss and climate change.\n\nStablecoin issuer Tether is among the investors in the first funding round to develop Volcano Energy, although its investment figure is undisclosed. Tether chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino said the investment marks the stablecoin issuer\u2019s intent to drive investment in renewable energy production and mining infrastructure.\n\nAccording to Volcano Energy, the 241-MW power generation capacity will be divided between 169 MWs of photovoltaic solar energy and 72 MWs of wind energy. According to Tether, the computing power of the park is estimated to exceed 1.3 exahashes per second. If achieved, this would position Volcano Energy\u2019s cumulative Bitcoin mining hash rate among the top 20 pools worldwide.\n\nAccording to Volcano Energy, the park is a pioneering example of Bitcoin mining driven by renewable energy, reflecting the industry\u2019s constant innovation and growth in a competitive landscape:\n\n\u201cFlip the script on traditional finance. Volcano Energy is powering the Bitcoin revolution in El Salvador with renewable energy.\u201c\n\nThe Salvadoran government will play a crucial role in the planning and execution of the initiative, securing preferred participation equivalent to 23% of revenues. The investors will own 27%, with the remaining 50% reinvested in expanding energy production capacity and advancing Bitcoin mining.\n\nRelated: \u2018The Bitcoin Standard\u2019 author becomes economic adviser to El Salvador\n\nKeiser, a Bitcoin advocate and podcaster, plays a pivotal role in El Salvador\u2019s adoption initiatives, serving as an adviser to President Nayib Bukele and chairman at Volcano Energy.\n\nThe Central American country continues efforts to drive Bitcoin adoption after becoming the first nation to make BTC legal tender in 2021.\n\nMagazine: What it\u2019s actually like to use Bitcoin in El Salvador"

        "title": "Bullish on Bitcoin? This Skyrocketing Stock Is a Screaming Buy - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) mining stocks have seen a huge rally this year, largely on the strength of Bitcoin's market-topping performance in the crypto market. Bitcoin is now up 60% year to date, and Bitcoin mining stocks are up even more. Riot Platforms (RIOT 0.95%), for example, is up about 215% for the year.\n\nThe big question for investors, of course, is whether this rally has legs. Even after Riot Platforms reported better-than-expected numbers in May, its stock price still fell by 13%. Much of that has to do with Bitcoin's recent inability to break through the $30,000 price level, which has investors concerned that the crypto's sizzling performance to start the year may be coming to an end.\n\nRiot and the price of Bitcoin\n\nLong story short, Bitcoin mining stocks tend to move up and down with Bitcoin. This makes perfect sense because the core business activity of any Bitcoin miner is, well, mining Bitcoin. The more Bitcoin a company mines, the more money it makes. And the higher the price of Bitcoin goes, the more valuable each Bitcoin it mines becomes. It's not rocket science.\n\nIf you're a long-term buy-and-hold investor, though, this well-known correlation makes investing in Bitcoin mining stocks very problematic. It means that you will be tempted to sell during low points of the Bitcoin market and buy during high points of the Bitcoin market. This is exactly the opposite of a buy-low, sell-high strategy, and highlights the perils of trying to time markets.\n\nImpact of the Bitcoin halving\n\nInvestors are keeping a close eye on the next Bitcoin halving, now scheduled for April 2024. Halvings take place only once every four years and are one of the most anticipated events in the Bitcoin community, primarily due to a past history of significant price gains that have accompanied every halving event since 2012.\n\nIn a halving, the reward for mining a new block of Bitcoin falls by half. Thus, in April 2024, the reward for mining new coins will drop from 6.25 Bitcoins to 3.125 Bitcoins. On the surface, this would seem to be a negative development for Bitcoin miners. It means they will be expending the same amount of energy but getting a smaller reward, right?\n\nHowever, if you take into account the price appreciation in Bitcoin that can occur both before and after a halving, then this effect is largely negated. There have now been three past Bitcoin halvings (in 2012, 2016, and 2020), and each one has seen monster price appreciation for Bitcoin. In 2020, for example, the price of Bitcoin exploded by 688% after the halving.\n\nAlthough there is some debate about whether this historical cycle will repeat in 2024, there are plenty of analysts and investors who think it will, so it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. By some estimates, the price of Bitcoin could blow through its all-time high of $68,790 and move toward $100,000 -- if not higher. And that would be tremendous news for Riot. Even though the company will be earning less Bitcoin next year, each new Bitcoin might become much more valuable.\n\nIs Riot a good long-term investment?\n\nIn the short run, then, Riot would seem to be an attractive investment target. But what about in the long run? From my perspective, there are two variables to consider here.\n\nThe first variable is whether Riot Platforms can remain a best-in-class Bitcoin miner. Based on what we know about Riot's current mining capacity and willingness to take on new Bitcoin mining infrastructure, this looks very favorable. Dating back to the start of 2022, Riot has mined the second-highest number of Bitcoins in the industry. And it has done so with a lower cost basis than its rivals.\n\nThe other variable is whether Riot can diversify its core business so that it is not so cyclical. Riot is never going to be a stock you can buy and forget about until it is more diversified. There's good news on this front. In January, the company changed its name from Riot Blockchain to Riot Platforms as a way to signal to the market that the company has future plans to diversify. Some have suggested that Riot could find other uses for its high-performance computer facilities, including artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.\n\nUntil this happens, the decision of whether to invest in Riot is still just a decision of where you think the market for Bitcoin is headed. Personally, I think the market for Bitcoin is headed higher in 2023 and early 2024, primarily due to the upcoming halving event. From my perspective, that makes Riot a screaming buy for the next 12 months."

        "title": "Bitcoin rebound falters amid SEC crackdown on exchanges, raising chance of a BTC price capitulation - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price lost steam after a failed retest of the $27,400 resistance on June 6, signaling that investors became less confident after the recent regulatory actions by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance and Coinbase. Both exchanges are being sued on multiple counts, including failure to register as licensed brokers and offering unregistered securities.\n\nThe SEC might have a difficult case ahead\n\nAccording to Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith, the SEC is trying to circumvent formal rulemaking processes and deny public engagement. Meanwhile, Insider Intelligence crypto analyst Will Paige said the SEC\u2019s intent is to police the space through enforcement in the absence of a regulatory framework.\n\nThose criticisms explain why investors may be clinging to their hopes in the U.S. Financial Services Committee hearing scheduled for June 13.\n\nThe potential overreach of the SEC has caused ripples multiple times, including in the U.S. legislature. Sen. Bill Hagerty, for instance, stated that regulators at the SEC are \u201cweaponizing their role\u201d and publicly called out SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.\n\nThe @SECGov is weaponizing their role to kill an industry. Allowing a company to list publicly and then stonewalling their attempts to register is indefensible. @GaryGensler, expect to hear from Congress.https://t.co/GdprSW1Yns \u2014 Senator Bill Hagerty (@SenatorHagerty) June 6, 2023\n\nFurther supporting the thesis that the cryptocurrency space can function without crypto-banks, as the centralized exchanges are commonly known, is the sudden increase in decentralized finance volumes.\n\nThe median trading volume across the top three decentralized exchanges (DEXs) jumped 444% between June 5 and June 7. As DEX volumes surged, net outflows on Binance reached $778 million, the difference between the value of assets entering and exiting the exchange.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has been trying to reclaim the $27,000 support, but that might be harder than expected given the upcoming $670 million weekly options expiry on June 9.\n\nBulls have been caught by surprise with the negative newsflow\n\nIt is worth noting that the actual open interest for the June 9 expiry will be lower since bulls concentrated their wagers above $27,000. These traders got excessively optimistic after Bitcoin\u2019s price gained 9% between May 25 and May 29, testing the $28,000 resistance.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for June 9. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 0.63 put-to-call ratio reflects the imbalance between the $410 million in call (buy) open interest and the $260 million in put (sell) options. However, if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $26,500 at 8:00 am UTC on June 9, only $38 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $27,000 or $28,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nRelated: US District Court issues summons for Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao over SEC action\n\nBitcoin bears aim for sub-$26,000 to increase their payout\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on June 9 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies depending on the expiry price.\n\nThe imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $25,000 and $26,000: 100 calls vs. 5,100 puts. Bears in total control, profiting $125 million.\n\n100 calls vs. 5,100 puts. Bears in total control, profiting $125 million. Between $26,000 and $27,000: 1,500 calls vs. 3,900 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $65 million.\n\n1,500 calls vs. 3,900 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $65 million. Between $27,000 and $28,000: 4,200 calls vs. 1,300 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $80 million.\n\n4,200 calls vs. 1,300 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $80 million. Between $28,000 and $29,000: 8,700 calls vs. 700 puts. The net result favors call (bull) instruments by $225 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the put options used in bearish bets and the call options exclusively in neutral-to-bullish trades. This oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nGiven that Bitcoin longs using futures contracts were liquidated to the tune of $100 million on June 5, bulls might have less margin required to try pumping the BTC price above the $27,000 mark. Consequently, bears seem closer to scoring a decent profit on Friday\u2019s options expiry.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "\u201cBitcoin has such a marketing problem.\u201d\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what came to mind for Bitcoin (BTC) advocate and Cointelegraph reporter Joe Hall when he was asked about the weaknesses and strengths of the popular cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile not labeling himself a \u201cBitcoin maximalist,\u201d Hall believes that most people \u2014 including crypto OGs \u2014 are shockingly unaware of what Bitcoin can do; and for this reason, he questions the necessity and future of most altcoin projects.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing it with imperfect solutions that in the long term will rug-pull them or close enough to that. Because, let\u2019s be honest, all of these crypto projects eventually collapse into Bitcoin, or they eventually collapse full stop. I mean, we saw enough of that last year. And, you know, in 10, 15, 20, maybe 40 years\u2019 time, will Bitcoin still be running? 1,000%. Will Ethereum still be running? Question marks. And will the other 20-ish thousand crypto projects still be going strong? I\u2019m pretty confident they won\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nHall proved his point by asking co-hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond to open up their Bitcoin Lightning wallets to accept the equivalent of $5 in satoshis. And after DeYoung downloaded the wallet and received the payment, both co-hosts were astonished at the speed of the transaction.\n\nOn Episode 13 of The Agenda podcast, Salmond and DeYoung spoke with Hall about his views on Bitcoin adoption and its \u201cmarketing problem,\u201d his ultimate vision of how Bitcoin could eventually conquer the financial world, and how his experience as a Bitcoin evangelist has connected him with people all around the world.\n\nIt\u2019s more than just money\n\nHall believes that Bitcoin is more than just money: It\u2019s a revolution, a lifestyle, a binder of people and a builder of community.\n\nHall said:\n\n\u201cBitcoin, to me, in my own words: It\u2019s an expression of how we approach the world, I guess. I mean, it\u2019s had an impact on me, in terms of my approach to people, to different cultures and in the way in which I interact with people \u2014 despite the fact that it is just a bunch of code on a screen. And because it\u2019s rewired the way in which I look at the world and consider things, it\u2019s taught me to be more skeptical and to not take things at face value. But it\u2019s also delivered a lot of hope and a lot of sort of meaning to my existence that perhaps wasn\u2019t there previously.\u201d\n\nHall has elected to only live off Bitcoin for day-to-day expenses, excluding when he has to pay European Union taxes. As to why he is such a strong believer in the digital currency, Hall shared, \u201cWe can\u2019t live in a world that is governed by growth at all costs when we have one finite, very precious planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin, for me, it appeals to me because of the way that it flips that all on its head. You know, we have a deflationary currency, there\u2019s only going to be 21 million, and we can rebuild our economic system off that in a way that raises all boats, not just the elite few. And it tackles things like the wealth gap and wealth inequality. It tackles things like the environment and the way in which, you know, Bitcoin mining could be this transition to using more and more renewable energies.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Hall\u2019s conversation with The Agenda \u2014 including Hall\u2019s future vision for Bitcoin and his fascination with the Lightning Network \u2014 listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph\u2019s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

CZ is one of the most powerful people in crypto and one of the greatest innovators. Interviewing him on stage was incredible.\u201d\n\nIt seems that Heilpern made a positive impression on CZ, too, as they often can be seen engaging in banter on Twitter.\n\nWhat led to Layah Heilpern\u2019s Twitter fame?\n\nHeilpern has been on Twitter for over a decade and explains there is no shortcut to growing a fanbase \u2014 other than actually putting in the work.\n\n\u201cWhen you tweet every day, you tend to build a following. I think it\u2019s also because I speak the truth about certain things. I think people are thirsty for the truth\u2026 whatever the truth might be.\u201d\n\nShe explains that the more followers you have, the easier it is to build more followers \u201cbecause you have credibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can gain 50,000 followers in one month, whereas that could take somebody like two years to do. So, it sort of becomes quite rapid growth eventually,\u201d she says.\n\nBut the fame side of things doesn\u2019t really excite Heilpern.\n\nWhat can you expect on Heilpern\u2019s Twitter account?\n\nHeilpern doesn\u2019t want to sugar-coat it: Her content is not for everyone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much freedom orientated. It\u2019s very much anti-system, Bitcoin-focused, uplifting, and positive, personal responsibility,\u201d she explains.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t feel the need to appeal to everyone either.\n\n\u201cI speak very unapologetically; I think there is just a gap in the market for that. So, people just run to you,\u201d she says.\n\nHeilpern says that, as her audience grows, she does have to be more cautious about the impact of her words and to be more mindful of her safety.\n\n\u201cMy words have more weight, so I can\u2019t make as many jokes anymore. But I still try not to censor myself too much. I also have to be careful about sharing personal information, which I will be doing less of.\u201d\n\nThat being said, Heilpern has no problem taking shots at multibillion-dollar corporations.\n\nWhat Heilpern enjoys on Twitter\n\nHeilpern enjoys like-minded people on Twitter who \u201cspeak the truth about things\u201d whether that is in crypto or politics \u2014 she just craves honesty and hates bullshit.\n\n\u201cI like people who call out the bullshit that we see in the system. I don\u2019t like people who pander to their audience. I like people who are unapologetic and say things how they are.\u201d\n\nLayah Heilpern\u2019s price predictions\n\nHeilpern\u2019s Bitcoin price prediction for the remainder of 2023 isn\u2019t exactly going to have you jumping out of your seat.\n\n\u201cOver the next six months towards the end of 2023, I would say we\u2019re just going to continue to move sideways. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go any higher than $34,000\u2013$35,000,\u201d she says.\n\nHowever, she is optimistic about Bitcoin over what the next 12\u201324 months can bring.\n\n\u201cI mean, maybe at the end of 2024, we could potentially reach all-time highs, again around $69,000, but that is not financial advice,\u201d she says.\n\nHeilpern says Bitcoin could hit $100,000 in \u201cearly 2025.\u201d\n\nWhile Heilpern can\u2019t remember if it was Bitcoin or XRP that she bought first, she does admit that she \u201csold the XRP immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have any predictions for the other [cryptocurrencies]. I just think they\u2019re all very unpredictable shitcoins,\u201d she states.\n\nAs for Ethereum, Heilpern doesn\u2019t see the price dropping anytime soon but has no interest in it.\n\n\u201cThe price of Ethereum will continue to rise in my opinion, given how much is being built on it. However, I don\u2019t like Ethereum, as I think it\u2019s controlled by the elites and not decentralized.\u201d"

There are ways to pay with crypto at even more merchants. However, by using a third-party service that converts your crypto to fiat to complete the transaction.\n\nCrypto cards that convert cryptocurrencies into fiat in order to complete a purchase may incur a taxable event. Since you are technically selling your crypto and buying fiat, you could be subject to capital gains tax if your crypto has appreciated since you initially purchased it. Converting stablecoins such as USDC or USDT into fiat does not incur this tax liability because these stablecoins are equal to a dollar in value.\n\nCrypto Debit Cards\n\nVisa and Mastercard, the two largest payment processors, have partnered with several of the most popular crypto companies to provide crypto debit cards. These cards are accepted anywhere that regular Visa and Mastercard cards are accepted \u2014 meaning you can use your crypto debit card just like a traditional debit card.\n\nCard Provider Card Type Rewards Rate Best For Coinbase Card Visa Debit Up to 4% cashback Low fees Crypto.com Card Visa Debit 1% to 5% cashback in CRO token CRO holders Binance Card Visa Debit Up to 8% cashback in BNB token EU residents BitPay Card Mastercard Debit Varies by merchant Frequent shoppers Gemini Card Mastercard Credit 3% back on dining, 2% back on groceries, 1% back on everything else Traditional Crypto Credit Cards Nexo Card Mastercard Credit Up to 2% cashback in NEXO token Collateralized-Loan Crypto Credit Cards\n\nVisa Crypto Cards\n\nCoinbase Visa Card: The Visa card from Coinbase lets you spend your Coinbase crypto balance anywhere Visa is accepted.

Instead, you can use your crypto to purchase gift cards to your favorite stores.\n\nPurchase gift cards from thousands of retailers using crypto here:\n\nShould You Pay With Crypto?\n\nWhether merchants support crypto or not, you can use crypto debit cards, credit cards, and gift cards to spend crypto almost anywhere. It\u2019s important, however, to weigh the benefits and downsides of spending your crypto on everyday purchases and decide if it\u2019s for you.\n\nCrypto allows for anonymous transacting, but keep in mind that many companies are required by law to verify your identity. So while crypto payments are well-supported in general, spending your crypto anonymously may be harder.\n\nPaying with crypto can be a good idea when you have a large crypto balance that you want to put to work or if you need a transaction to clear quickly.\n\nCrypto payments can incur tax bills, however, and you might miss out on future price pumps.\n\nPros And Cons Of Paying With Crypto\n\nPros Spend in a currency of your choice\n\nSpend in a currency of your choice Earn rewards\n\nEarn rewards Enjoy instant payment settlement Cons You might have to pay taxes on converted crypto\n\nYou might have to pay taxes on converted crypto Extra fees\n\nExtra fees You can miss out on gains\n\nPros Explained\n\nSpend in a currency of your choice: Whether you hold lots of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, or Ethereum, it\u2019s nice to spend your crypto without converting it first.

        "title": "Hodling pays off for patient Bitcoin investors with 1000x returns - DLNews",
        "content": "Analysis from Unchained Capital shows investors holding BTC for more than five years did not lose money.\n\nBitcoin halving triggers bull and bear cycles and predictable patterns in volatile asset.\n\nThe hodlrs are right after all.\n\nFor all the ups and downs in Bitcoin\u2019s price one constant prevails \u2014 it consistently delivers net gains to investors who hold, or hodl in crypto parlance, the token for at least five years, according to analysis by Unchained Capital, a financial services firm.\n\nPatient investors multiplied their returns 1,000 times on a mean-adjusted basis over six to seven years, Unchained Capital said in a report entitled \u201cHODL Cave\u201d and released this week. The study also found that no investors who held BTC five years lost money.\n\nIn contrast, the mean return for investors holding BTC for two years could multiply 23 times but there was a slim chance they might lose half their initial investment.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n\u201cFor bitcoin detractors, this massive historical appreciation in value is the hardest fact about Bitcoin to explain away,\u201d said the report\u2019s authors, who analysed BTC returns over a 13-year period.\n\nThe power of halving\n\nAt first glance, it may seem obvious that holding an asset for a long time will eventually pay off. Yet unlike most other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin automatically regulates its scarcity in a way that directly impacts its valuation. It\u2019s called halving, and it has provided a key means for investors to anticipate the bull and bear cycles in Bitcoin.\n\nHardcoded into Bitcoin by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, halving reduces the number of newly minted tokens by 50% every four years. This means miners tending the Bitcoin blockchain must compete for fewer tokens as a reward for their efforts. It also means the price of Bitcoin predictably goes up as supply diminishes.\n\nNOW READ: Arbitrum just came to a sudden halt \u2014 it ran out of money for gas\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThroughout its history, the price of Bitcoin has set a new all-time high between 12 and 18 months after each halving event. The last halving was in 2020 and the next one will happen in 2024. Over the last three years, Bitcoin has swung from a low of $5,000 to an all-time high of about $65,000, and settled back again to $26,434, which is where it was trading on Thursday.\n\nAs a result, halving has become a trigger for a bull market in Bitcoin and in the crypto market as a whole given the token\u2019s dominance. Bitcoin accounts for 44.7% of the cryptocurrency market\u2019s total capitalisation, according to CoinGecko.\n\nHodling becomes a thing\n\nEven so, Bitcoin has crashed after every all-time high. This decline is then followed by a choppy period of sideways price action that gives way to another bull run after the next halving.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin may be a white knuckle ride, but now, with more than a decade of data to examine, a clear pattern is emerging that may embolden even more hodling.\n\nHodling has become a badge of honour among investors who sit on their positions even when it looks like the bottom is falling out of the market.\n\nHodling became a thing back in 2013 when GameKyuubi, the pseudonymous member of the Bitcointalk forum, coined the term as a deliberate typographical error. \u201cI am hodling,\u201d he said in December 2013.\n\nNow hodling has become a badge of honour among investors who sit on their positions even when it looks like the bottom is falling out of the market, as it did last November when FTX failed and Bitcoin lost more than a quarter of its value in four days.\n\nNOW READ: How Coinbase\u2019s SEC woes clobber its earnings outlook\n\nFunny enough, GameKyuubi is promoting the same idea long championed by Warren Buffett, the billionaire investing legend, who has long advised buying the S&P 500 Index and holding it forever.\n\nBut of course, being a short-term investor in Bitcoin is a very different trip than holding the top 500 stocks in the US. Investors who bought BTC in 2021 have had to stomach a vertiginous risk-reward ratio as the market is whipsawed by regulatory action against Coinbase, Binance, and Genesis. Still, BTC is up 59% this year.\n\nBuy and forget\n\nUnchained Capital\u2019s analysts also weighed the human factor in their report. The simple fact is that investors who sit on their positions for longer time-frames tend to become less likely to sell. They get comfortable hodling BTC the same way Buffett is comfy sitting on his stocks decade after decade.\n\n\u201cThe biggest reason that exiting a decade-long bitcoin position for massive returns is a fantasy is that investors who have actually held bitcoin for a decade or more no longer think about exiting Bitcoin,\u201d the authors said.\n\nCall it inertia or buy-and-forget or hodling. Whatever the label, the data show the approach delivers for investors who play the long game.\n\nHave tips about Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies? Contact the author at osato@dlnews.com."

The term, cryptocurrency derives from the origin of the encryption techniques that are employed to secure the netw Read this Term. The company, listed on both the London Stock Exchange (LSE: ARB) and NASDAQ (ARBK), showcased a significant uptick in its Bitcoin (BTC) mining operations.\n\nArgo Blockchain Reports Higher BTC Production\n\nDuring May, Argo mined a total of 173 BTC, averaging 5.6 BTC per day. This marks a substantial increase of 16% from the preceding month, with an average daily production rate of 4.8 BTC. The swell in BTC production can be attributed to increased uptime and an improvement in the operational efficiency of the company's mining fleet. Moreover, a jump in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network contributed to the overall surge in production.\n\nIn addition, the previous month saw a rise in mining revenue for Argo, reaching $4.75 million. This is a solid leap of 14% from April's earnings which stood at $4.17 million. However, the company observed a decrease in the BTC holdings over the month, with 50 BTC held at the end of May which is down from 83 BTC held at April's end. This decline stems from the company's decision to liquidate certain digital assets with the intent to utilize the proceeds toward debt repayment.\n\n\"I'm pleased by the significant increase in the company's BTC production during the month of May,\" Seif El-Bakly, the Interim CEO of Argo Blockchain, commented. \"This is a testament to the hard work of our mining operations team to optimize performance across our fleet.\"\n\nKeep Reading Nigeria Presses Binance amid Economic Turmoil and Detains Executives\n\nArgo Blockchain's total hash rate capacity remains steady at 2.5 Exahashes per second (EH/s). Nevertheless, the company anticipates a boost in capacity following the introduction of new BlockMiner machines at its Quebec facilities later this year. The additional machinery is projected to elevate the company's total hash rate capacity by 12% to approximately to 2.8 EH/s.\n\nEl-Bakly added: \"Over the long term, I believe increased Bitcoin network activity has the potential to drive demand for block space and increase miner fees.\" His statement reflects a positive outlook on the future prospects of Bitcoin mining operations, signifying Argo's commitment to capitalizing on the promising market dynamics.\n\nArgo Produced 491 BTC in Q1, but Net Result on the Downside\n\nYesterday (Tuesday), Argo published unaudited financial results for Q1 2023, showing a total BTC production of 491 tokens in the reported period and an average mining rate which is similar to May's figures. Although the report showed notable improvements in revenue, cash reserves, and cost reductions, the company could not achieve a positive net result.\n\nArgo Blockchain achieved a surge of 15% in revenue from Q4 2022, amounting to $11.4 million. Despite incurring a net loss of $8.7 million, the company attained an adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 million.\n\nIn its recently published financials for 2022, the publicly-listed miner reported a year-end revenue of $58.6 million, representing a significant decline of 36%. The company faced a net loss of $240.2 million for the year, primarily attributed to the diminishing value of cryptos.\n\nDespite the company reporting net losses, it appears to be on the path to stabilization.

Understanding its history and prospects can provide insights into the potential movement of the crypto economy. While specific and accurate predictions are challenging due to the unpredictable nature of the market, industry professionals have shared their perspectives on Bitcoin\u2019s future. Here are some expert predictions:\n\nBobby Lee: The CEO of BTC China, Bobby Lee, believes Bitcoin can reach $1,000,000 in 20 years. He has made accurate predictions, such as Bitcoin falling to $41,000 in 2023.\n\nMark Yusko: Formerly a Bitcoin skeptic, Mark Yusko now predicts a price of $500,000 for Bitcoin in 2030. He also believes Bitcoin can achieve equivalence with gold in the future.\n\nJohn Pfeffer: Partner at Pfeffer Capital, John Pfeffer, uses mathematical calculations to predict a price of $700,000 for Bitcoin in 2030.\n\nThese predictions may turn true, but the situation is clear that Bitcoin will become one of the essential economic assets to own shortly. With the increasing technology adoption, the need for experts will grow too.\n\nJob and Salary Prospects\n\nThe salary prediction for a Bitcoin expert can vary depending on the experience and skills of the individual. However, according to a recent report by Glassdoor, the average salary for a Bitcoin expert in the United States is $150,000. The report also found that the highest-paying cities for Bitcoin experts are New York City, San Francisco, and Chicago. The salary for a Bitcoin expert can also vary depending on the industry in which they work. For example, Bitcoin experts in the financial sector tend to earn higher salaries than those in the technology industry.\n\nBut, the salary for a Bitcoin expert is expected to grow in the coming years. This is due to the increasing demand for Bitcoin expertise as cryptocurrency becomes more prevalent, as we already discussed, and this is probably the best time to learn about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency-related concepts."

        "title": "Crypto ownership doubles in UK before new rules kick in - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nCrypto ownership more than doubled in the UK last year, the Financial Conduct Authority said on Wednesday, as it announced an October start date for its clampdown on mis-selling in a sector often dubbed finance\u2019s \u201cWild West\u201d.\n\nAlmost one in 10 people surveyed by the UK\u2019s top financial regulator owned cryptocurrencies in 2022, more than twice the number a year earlier, despite regulators warning that crypto investors should be prepared to lose their entire outlay.\n\n\u201cIt is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto . . . Our rules give people the time and the right risk warnings to make an informed choice,\u201d said Sheldon Mills, the FCA\u2019s head of consumers and competition. He added that its crackdown on crypto group advertising would begin on October 8.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s update comes in a bruising week for the crypto industry after two of its largest exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, were sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over alleged securities law violations.\n\nIn recent months, the UK has proposed a sweeping new regulatory regime for crypto where rules governing the industry will be brought more closely into line with those for traditional financial services. A cross-party group of MPs recently criticised the policy, suggesting instead that crypto be overseen as a form of gambling.\n\nSome 36 per cent of 2,000 adults polled by the FCA said they had seen or heard crypto adverts, while 25 per cent of those who had not previously been involved in crypto became \u201ccurious\u201d as a result of being exposed to advertising campaigns.\n\nThe FCA\u2019s crypto marketing regime will require companies to use risk warnings and offer a \u201c24-hour cooling-off period\u201d for customers. Incentives for customers to \u201crefer a friend\u201d will also be banned.\n\nThe regime will apply to all crypto asset businesses marketing to UK customers, regardless of whether they are based in the UK or overseas. \u201cThe crypto industry needs to prepare now for this significant change,\u201d Mills said.\n\nHarry Eddis, a lawyer at Linklaters, said the rules would have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on the UK market by making it harder for people to buy crypto currency.\n\nThe FCA currently regulates crypto firms for money-laundering compliance only. Its research found that 28 per of those who do not use crypto would be \u201cmore likely\u201d to buy it if the market and activity were regulated to a similar standard as traditional financial services.\n\nThe increase in ownership of crypto assets has come despite a tumultuous period for the market, which suffered a crisis of confidence last year that resulted in the collapse of former industry bellwether FTX.\n\nThe research also showed almost four-fifths of those buying crypto used disposable income to fund the purchases, 6 per cent borrowed money, and the rest used savings or gains from crypto sales.\n\nThe mean value of their investments was put at just under \u00a31,600, with 40 per cent holding less than \u00a3100. The most common reason given for buying crypto, as stated by 40 per cent of respondents, was \u201cas a gamble\u201d.\n\nThe price of the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which peaked at more than $64,000 in November 2022, on Wednesday fell nearly 3 per cent to $26,484.\n\nA renewed crackdown on crypto marketing follows a blitz of American enforcement cases this week.\n\nThe SEC on Monday filed a lawsuit against Binance, alleging the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange mixed billions of dollars of customer cash with a separate trading firm owned by its chief executive Changpeng Zhao.\n\nOn Tuesday, the SEC sued Nasdaq-listed rival exchange Coinbase, alleging it violated US securities law by failing to register as a broker, national securities exchange or clearing agency."

        "title": "Shattering the Illusion: Bitcoin's Limitations as a Currency - Worldline",
        "content": "There is a fascinating story, taking place during World War II, inside a concentration camp, built by German forces, for Western prisoners of war. This gripping tale explains the reason and the way a currency is created, the rules that govern its transactions and the needs that shape them. At the same time, the story explains, in simple words, some economic terms like arbitrage, default and equilibrium, using a few packets of cigarettes, some grams of coffee and a few chocolate bars. It is a story told in chapter 7 of the book \u201cTalking to my Daughter\u201d by Y.Varoufakis. Yet you may ask \u2013 how does this link to Bitcoin's Limitations as a Currency?\n\nLet's take a moment to get a clear picture of the difference between money and currency, so we can put any misunderstandings to rest once and for all! Money, my friends, is the intangible stuff that's all about numbers, while currency is the physical money you can hold in your hands - you know, coins and paper notes. Now that we've got that sorted out, let's look back to the war story. Aside from the main lesson of that chapter, which is that money cannot be kept separate from the state, the author goes on to argue (after a supply of quite a lot Red Cross packages) that the fixed quantity of Bitcoins, their scarcity, raises two important issues: firstly, a deflationary effect (Bitcoin is deflationary by design due to its limited supply) and secondly, as a result of the first, the impossibility of reflating the economy by increasing its quantity. The author has also, using this specific chapter to make his point, highlighted that Bitcoin is definitely not the answer to the question \u201cWhat is money, really?\u201d\n\nStaying for a while on the deflationary question, there are opposite voices through time, either arguing between price and supply deflation or highlighting that Bitcoin is designed to experience predictable and low inflation rates. In fact, it is worth mentioning that there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins. This hard-set limit (that can be modified only with a change to the Bitcoin code and a general consensus of the Bitcoin community) creates a sense of ingrained value, and it was the result of a well-thought-out process when figuring out the right supply-and-demand dynamics at the launch of the Bitcoin project. It was intended to mimic the characteristics of a scarce asset like gold, diamonds or even art.\n\nIn other words, this limited supply is intended to increase the value of each individual bitcoin over time, as demand for the cryptocurrency grows but the supply remains relatively fixed. In contrast, fiat currencies are often vulnerable to inflation due to their reliance on central banks or monetary authorities for issuance and regulation. These governing bodies possess the authority to manipulate monetary policies, including the control of money supply and interest rates. When expansive monetary policies are implemented, such as the injection of additional currency into circulation, the value of the currency can gradually diminish over time. This ongoing increase in the money supply can erode its purchasing power and undermine the stability of fiat currencies.\n\nHowever, this deflationary nature of Bitcoin can also be a double-edged sword. While it can increase the value of individual Bitcoins over time, it can also lead to hoarding and a reluctance to spend the currency, as people may believe that its value will continue to rise in the future. This can hinder the adoption of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, as people are less willing to spend their currency if they believe it will be worth more in the future.\n\nThere are even inherently incorporated disinflationary measures inside Bitcoin (like \u201chalving\u201d which, every four years, reduces the number of Bitcoins that can be mined and enter into circulation). The truth is that:\n\nAlready 19,306,581 Bitcoins (or 92% of the total supply) have been produced so far (according to coinmarketcap.com on 3 rd March 2023)\n\nMarch 2023) A large amount of bitcoins (around 20-23%) are lost forever, mostly due to the loss of private keys\n\nThe last new bitcoin will be generated around the year 2140\n\nThe design intention was that, as the overall supply of Bitcoin decreases, the market value of the currency increases, and its purchasing power goes up. The truth is that the success and stability of Bitcoin's value are subject to market dynamics, regulatory developments, and mostly investor sentiment. Bitcoin's volatility and the lack of intrinsic value make its long-term success as a widely recognized and stable asset quite uncertain. Based on the above, there is no reason to believe that Bitcoin is something that will replace money and there is no reason we should treat Bitcoin as such.\n\nBut let's try to take a less harsh view and take a closer look at what needs to be in place for something to be recognized as \"money\". Economists around the world agree that money has three basic functions: as a unit of account, as an acceptable medium of exchange and as a store of value. It should also be able to be used as a means for deferred payment.\n\nBitcoin does not sufficiently provide even one of these functions!\n\nIt performs poorly as a unit of account \u2013 that is: it is not a standard, widespread measurement for value, with prices of goods and services denominated in that currency. The (relatively few) merchants around the world that accept Bitcoins, invariably list their products\u2019 prices in the national currency of the country in which they are based (the volatility of Bitcoin would dramatically impact their prices, otherwise).\n\nBitcoin is also not widely used as an independent unit of account for other currencies to be measured with (while Bitcoin has gained some acceptance as a unit of account in certain circles, it is certainly not widely used in this way today).\n\nBitcoin has a very restricted use as a medium of exchange \u2013 money exists to make transactions possible, and this may be achieved only when it is accepted by buyers and sellers to pay debts or financial obligations.\n\nAlthough more and more sellers are accepting Bitcoin, the reality is that they are doing so more from a marketing/publicity perspective, and this trend is most likely to be halted once the Bitcoin price enters (again) bear market territory.\n\nTrust is also at the core of any system of money. Bitcoin\u2019s trust challenge lies in the fact that not many people are filled with confidence by its overall image \u2014 its sense of insecurity (not being backed by a Central Bank or a Government), its volatility, the constant threat of the regulator. Having all these in mind, we may conclude the poor function of Bitcoin as means for deferred payment\n\nAnd with this statement, we return to the final function of money: the store of value. According to Karl Schumpeter, one of the greatest economists of all time, along with Maynard Keynes & Milton Friedman, in his book published in 1930 \"A Treatise on Money\", the store of value can be defined as \u201c\u2026the will to possess something precious now\u2026and in the future\u201d, which brings us back to the Bitcoin\u2019s volatility issue.\n\nAccording to Bankrate, \"Bitcoin's price history: 2009 to 2023\": \u201cBitcoin\u2019s price has been on a roller coaster ride since it first debuted in January 2009, but the long-term trajectory has been higher \u2013 \u2018up and to the right,\u2019 as they say.\u201d Even, at the time of writing, and so far, this year, bitcoin has a change of 42,03% (according to coindesk.com on 27th February 2023). The extreme volatility of Bitcoin is mostly attributed to it not being intrinsically valuable: there is nothing that is backing up its value, other than feelings and projections.\n\nWhy, then, should you consider Bitcoin as a viable replacement for traditional money? After careful examination, it is clear that Bitcoin falls short of being a true form of money. While it boasts precise accounting facilitated by digital specificity through cryptography and is often hailed as a digital store of value, it is unrealistic to expect Bitcoin to fully supplant money in a vast and diverse economy. While it may find utility in certain scenarios, Bitcoin's limitations and its fundamental divergence from the characteristics of traditional money suggest that widespread adoption as a complete substitute remains unlikely.\n\nRead my next article about Bitcoin\u2019s Future: The Great Deception and the Real Promise\n\nThe opinions and ideas expressed here are my own and I would be happy to discuss them - contact me at Makis.Malioris@worldline.com"

        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs: What are Bitcoin Ordinals? - Milk Road",
        "content": "So you might have heard about NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. They\u2019re basically like digital trading cards that you can buy and sell. They live entirely on the blockchain. Some popular NFT collections include the CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club. While most NFTs are on the ETH blockchain, Bitcoin NFTs are now making their way mainstream. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\nWhat Are Bitcoin NFTs?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: NFTs exist on different blockchains. Most NFTs are stored on the Ethereum blockchain. This is because the technology that powers NFTs uses \u201csmart contracts,\u201d an innovation that first became available on Ethereum in 2015.\n\nSome other chains like Solana also have their own NFTs, but Ethereum has been the largest blockchain that allows for NFTs\u2026 until now.\n\nToday, you can purchase NFTs on Bitcoin. That\u2019s right, the original blockchain (and the most popular cryptocurrency project) now supports NFTs. Bitcoin NFTs work quite differently from those on other chains \u2014 in fact, they\u2019re only possible because of an update that was introduced to the Bitcoin codebase in 2021.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nPros Allow you to buy and sell NFTs using the Bitcoin network\n\nAllow you to buy and sell NFTs using the Bitcoin network Can store more than just images \u2014 audio and video files can also be Bitcoin NFTs\n\nCan store more than just images \u2014 audio and video files can also be Bitcoin NFTs Cheaper to create than NFTs on Ethereum Cons Departs from the original concept of Bitcoin as a payments-only platform\n\nDeparts from the original concept of Bitcoin as a payments-only platform Can \u201cclog up\u201d the blockchain and reduce fees awarded to miners\n\nCan \u201cclog up\u201d the blockchain and reduce fees awarded to miners Concept still new and unexplored\n\nHow Do Bitcoin NFTs Work?\n\nSo here\u2019s the deal: Most blockchains get updated regularly for security and expansion purposes. Bitcoin received an upgrade (codenamed \u201cTaproot\u201d) in November 2021 that made it easy to store large amounts of data on the Bitcoin blockchain. This was meant as a future-proof upgrade in order to help Bitcoin stuff more data into every block.\n\nSome enterprising programmers, however, realized they could use this upgrade to store entire files on the Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 thus creating Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals NFTs\n\nThe Ordinals protocol is where the rubber meets the road on Bitcoin NFTs. The basic gist (with as little technical mumbo jumbo as possible) is that Ordinals allows you to \u201cinscribe\u201d a tiny amount of Bitcoin with a unique ID that lets you track that particular digital asset around.\n\nIn fact, you can go to the Ordinals website today and see the latest \u201cinscriptions\u201d (or NFTs) that people have created on Bitcoin. These range from profile-picture-style NFTs to messages to time travelers, memes, and even an audio file of Elon Musk talking about the teachings of Jesus. Someone even created a playable videogame as a Bitcoin NFT.\n\nPretty cool stuff, right?\n\nHow To Buy Bitcoin Ordinals\n\nStep 1: Choose The Right Wallet.\n\nYou will need a wallet to store the Bitcoin Ordinals that you want to purchase. Examples of wallets that support it include the Ordinals Wallet, Hiro Wallet, and Xverse. We\u2019ll use the Ordinals Wallet for this example.\n\nStep 2: Set Up Your Wallet.\n\nYou need to set up your wallet on whichever platform you pick. Select a unique password for it, and you\u2019ll be assigned a seed phrase that lets you recover your wallet in case you forget the password.\n\nStep 3: Deposit Funds Into Your Wallet.\n\nSend BTC tokens to the address of your wallet, which you\u2019ll use to pay for the Ordinals.\n\nStep 4: Buy The Ordinals.\n\nOnce your funds have been deposited, you can browse through the Ordinals collections and select the one you wish to purchase. Pay for it (including NFT royalty fees if they apply) and it\u2019ll be added to your wallet. The process is similar regardless of what wallet provider you choose.\n\nTop Bitcoin Ordinal Projects\n\nTwelveFold TwelveFold is a collection of 300 generative art pieces inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain, with each piece representing a complete art project. This Ordinals project was created by Yuga Labs, the company behind the famous Bored Ape Yacht Club collection and the APE token. Because of the limited number of pieces and the clout of Yuga Labs, the TwelveFold collection has the potential to appreciate in the future.\n\nBitcoin Rocks Bitcoin Rocks is a limited collection of 100 art pieces inscribed onto satoshis on the blockchain. Each piece pays homage to the early days of crypto collectibles and NFTs. This is one of the most popular Ordinals projects, and the limited collection gives it the potential to appreciate in the future. Note that the lowest bid one can currently make is 2.7BTC, which represents over $60,000.\n\nTimechain Collectibles Timechain Collectibles is a collection of 21 exclusive Ordinals that showcase different types of timepieces, including pocket watches, ancient watches, clock towers, and more. All the pieces are minted into a single block and have consecutive Inscription numbers from 356-377. Some pieces are rarer than others and thus more expensive. Auctions are held on the project\u2019s Discord channel, with fierce bidding because of the exclusiveness.\n\nWhat Are People Saying About Bitcoin NFTs?\n\nPeople are split on whether Bitcoin NFTs are a good thing. Below are some tweets highlighting different viewpoints on this contentious question.\n\nOne of the benefits of Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs is they allow you to store much more data than you can on Ethereum. In the above thread, famous crypto personality Eric Wall explains how he used an Ordinals NFT to create the largest Bitcoin transaction (by data size) the network had seen in seven years. And he paid just $20 in fees to do it. In comparison, to store an NFT this large on Ethereum would have cost close to $140 \u2014 a 7x difference.\n\nSecuring the Bitcoin blockchain requires \u201cmining.\u201d This is cost-intensive, so the network rewards miners by giving them Bitcoin. Each time a new block is mined, 6.25 Bitcoins are generated and awarded to miners.\n\nEach block, however, gets harder to mine. There are concerns that Bitcoin will soon reach a point where it is not properly incentivizing miners to keep paying the enormous costs to mine new blocks. In response to this, some are saying that finding more Bitcoin use cases \u2014 such as Bitcoin NFTs \u2014 will help revitalize the Bitcoin ecosystem and solve this looming problem.\n\nOrdinals are an attack on #Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nIt's being orchestrated by known bad actors. \u2014 Derek Ross \u26a1\u26d3\ufe0f (@derekmross) February 2, 2023\n\nIt\u2019s generally accepted that Bitcoin was intended to be a payments-only blockchain. Bitcoin \u201cmaximalists,\u201d who believe Bitcoin should stick as closely as possible to its original purpose, are skeptical of Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nTo them, these projects pollute the Bitcoin ecosystem, using up valuable space on the blockchain. In addition, Bitcoin maximalists bring up an important point about Bitcoin NFTs \u2014 they greatly reduce the fees miners collect for their work.\n\nSince the image and video files of Bitcoin NFTs take up so much space, each \u201cblock\u201d of the Bitcoin blockchain is composed of fewer and fewer transactions. Fees are normally charged per transaction, so the fewer transactions there are, the fewer fees are collected. This could spell doom for the Bitcoin ecosystem if it cannot incentivize miners to keep the blockchain running.\n\nInterested in more NFT news? Check out our list of top NFT newsletters to stay in the loop.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nBitcoin NFTs bring the important innovation of tradeable digital assets to the very first blockchain to ever exist. While not everyone agrees this is necessarily a good idea, there are positives and negatives to it, and, most importantly, anyone can decide for themselves if they want to use Bitcoin NFTs or not.\n\nContributor George Hristov George is a tech writer interested in web3 startups and communities.

        "content": "3\u20136-month BTC holders join day and swing traders in sell-offs amidst SEC drama.\n\nBitcoin sees minimal realized loss as it maintains its support range of $25,000 and $26,000.\n\nThe recent drama involving two major exchanges and certain tokens in the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) suit has caused quite a stir, even though Bitcoin (BTC) itself was not directly involved. Nevertheless, Bitcoin\u2019s response to this news has been noteworthy.\n\nRead Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAs a result of these developments, certain groups of holders have chosen to sell their holdings. However, it is crucial to explore how this news and the actions of these holders have impacted other important metrics and the current market price of BTC.\n\nBitcoin witnesses some Long-term Holders dump\n\nThe recent developments surrounding Binance and Coinbase have had a noticeable impact on the price of Bitcoin (BTC), leading to a correction. Analyses of CryptoQuant\u2019s recent charts revealed that the sell-off volume of BTC was primarily influenced by day traders, swing traders, and some long-term holders.\n\nA closer examination of the Exchange Inflow Spent Output Age Bands provided interesting insights. On June 4, there was a modest increase in BTC inflow within the 0\u20131-day age band, with over 14,000 BTC entering the exchanges. This move was a regular occurrence based on historical data.\n\nHowever, June 5 witnessed a significant spike in the inflow from long-term holders in the three to six-month age band. This sudden surge saw over 3,000 BTC deposited, indicating an uncommon sell-off by this particular category of long-term holders.\n\nOn the other hand, the six and 12-month holders seemed relatively calm in their sales. But June 7 saw an unprecedented flow of over 1,000 BTC, marking the highest level since March. These observations suggested that short-term holders were the primary drivers behind the recent fluctuations in BTC\u2019s price. Long-term holders have generally held onto their coins.\n\nFurthermore, the Exchange Inflow \u2013 Spent Output Value Bands shed light on the volume of Bitcoin sold by various traders, ranging from 1 to 10,000 BTC over the past 13 months.\n\nBitcoin realized losses stay minimal\n\nAs U.S. regulatory pressure intensified on major cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase, the market witnessed a surge of high volatility, leading to substantial price swings. Despite these turbulent movements, recent data from Glassnode\u2019s chart revealed that the total Bitcoin Realized Losses recorded On-Chain amounted to a relatively modest $112 million.\n\nInterestingly, this figure represented a significant deviation of -$3.05 billion (-96.5%) from the largest recorded capitulation event. These findings suggested that market participants have displayed heightened resilience in the face of these regulatory challenges.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today\n\nCurrent support level maintained\n\nOn a daily timeframe chart, Bitcoin\u2019s price movement revealed a noteworthy trend that began on June 4. During this period, Bitcoin experienced substantial price fluctuations.\n\nHowever, it managed to sustain its support range, hovering around $26,000 to $25,000. As of this writing, BTC was trading at approximately $26,500, indicating a slight increase and suggesting a modest gain in value."

        "title": "Mysterious Bitcoin Wallet Comes to Life After Nine Years - Tekedia",
        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrencies, there are many mysteries and surprises. One of them is the phenomenon of dormant bitcoin wallets that suddenly become active after years of inactivity. These wallets contain large amounts of bitcoins that have been untouched for a long time, sometimes since the early days of bitcoin when the coins were worth very little.\n\nOne such wallet recently came to life after nine years of dormancy. The wallet contains 616 BTC, which is worth more than $40 million at the current market price. The wallet dates back to around the time that bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto was last active online and has seen its value increase by more than 800,000%\u2026 According to Whale Alert, a service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions, the wallet was activated on September 23, 2021, and transferred its entire balance to different addresses.\n\nWho owns this wallet and why did they decide to move their bitcoins after so long? This is a question that many in the crypto community are asking, but there is no definitive answer. Some speculate that it could be a whale, an individual or a group with a large stash of bitcoins, who is planning to sell or trade their coins. Others suggest that it could be someone who forgot or lost their password and finally managed to recover it. And some even wonder if it could be Satoshi Nakamoto himself, returning to claim his fortune.\n\nIt is not possible to link the wallet to an identity or a location, due to the anonymous and decentralized nature of bitcoin. However, it is possible to track the movements of the coins through the public blockchain ledger, which records every transaction that ever happened on the network. If the owner of the wallet decides to cash out their bitcoins on an exchange or a platform that requires identification, they might reveal themselves. But until then, they remain a mystery.\n\nThis is not the first time that a dormant wallet containing huge sums of bitcoins has been activated without explanation. In November 2020, a mystery person moved more than $1 billion worth of bitcoins from the fourth largest wallet in the world. The wallet had been inactive since 2015 and contained 69,369 BTC. In January 2021, another wallet that had been dormant since June 2010 woke up and transferred 50 BTC to another address. The wallet was believed to be one of the earliest ones created by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThere are dozens of other wallets that have been inactive for at least nine years and contain thousands of bitcoins each. Some of them might belong to people who died, lost their passwords, or simply forgot about their coins. Some of them might belong to early adopters who are waiting for the right moment to sell or use their bitcoins. And some of them might belong to unknown entities who have their own reasons for keeping their coins dormant.\n\nThe activation of these wallets can have an impact on the bitcoin market, as they introduce new supply and demand dynamics. If the owners decide to sell their bitcoins, they might cause a price drop and volatility in the short term. If they decide to hold or use their bitcoins, they might increase the demand and scarcity of the cryptocurrency. Alternatively, they could use their funds to support some crypto-related project or cause, or simply hold on to them for longer.\n\nThe activation of this dormant wallet is a reminder of the history and mystery of Bitcoin, a decentralized and pseudonymous currency that has grown from a niche experiment to a global phenomenon. It also shows that there are still many hidden treasures in the crypto space, waiting to be discovered or claimed by their rightful owners.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "title": "Cryptocurrency and FTX, 6 Months On | Financial Services | Bitcoin - Freeths",
        "content": "Never a stranger to volatility, cryptocurrency has seen a number of ups and downs over the years since its inception back in 2009. The last year, however, has been a particularly eventful one.\n\nMay 2023 marked six months following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. This proved to be a watershed moment for the industry and which has had substantial implications for both crypto firms and consumers, and has resulted in increased in scrutiny from governments and regulators.\n\nWe have set out below a recap of what happened to FTX, why this occurrence was so significant and what has happened in the crypto world in the six months since.\n\n2022 \u2013 A recap\n\nIn the early months of 2022, there was plenty to be positive about in the crypto world, particularly within the UK. April 2022 saw the end of the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s Temporary Registration Regime, and the full implementation of the legal requirement for all new and existing cryptoasset businesses to register with the FCA for the purposes of anti-money laundering rules before being able to operate. This concluded a two-year implementation process, and was one of the first key steps towards introducing a regulatory framework for crypto, and helped drive efforts to move it away from its perception as a tool for crime and money laundering.\n\nA more significant political development also came in April 2022 with the announcement of the UK government\u2019s plans to make the country a \u201cglobal hub for cryptoasset technology and investment.\u201d These plans were spearheaded by then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak, and comprised an initial package of plans including the planned use of stablecoins as a recognised form of payment, and opened up a call for evidence regarding the use of distributed ledger technology in financial markets. The announcement also included plans for the government to work with the Royal Mail to create its very own non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Sunak\u2019s subsequent elevation to the role of Prime Minister later in the year only served to bolster confidence in these pledges.\n\nIn terms of the markets, summer 2022 saw ongoing fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin \u2013 itself the largest and arguably the most well-known cryptocurrency \u2013 which were indicative of gradual market re-balancing following volatility which had been seen over the year prior.\n\nOn the tech front, progress was made in September 2022 when the Ethereum network successfully migrated its operating systems from a \u2018proof of work\u2019 system to \u2018proof of stake\u2019. This was expected to significantly cut down the amount of work and energy required to enable the network to operate and for transaction validations to occur, which has long been a source of criticism for cryptocurrencies.\n\nDespite this buzz of activity, crypto had its \u201cBlack Friday\u201d moment in November 2022, with the much-publicised collapse of FTX, which looked to undo much of the positivity that had been generated over the course of the year.\n\nWhat was FTX?\n\nFTX (short for \u201cFutures Exchange\u201d) was a Bahamas-based company led by CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, which operated as an exchange for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.\n\nCrypto exchanges are intended to allow users and investors to store their digital assets online, and allows users to swap, buy, sell, and exchange cryptocurrencies. In practical terms, crypto exchanges operate in a similar way to a traditional exchange platform and can also resemble a type of banking service, and there are a number of potential benefits to customers in using an exchange. They can allow users easy access without the need for self-storage and the risk of the user losing their own wallets or the \u201ckeys\u201d necessary to access these. They also facilitate and enable the purchase and sale of crypto assets, and so can be particularly attractive to investors who are often looking to buy and sell quickly.\n\nLike a bank, however, crypto exchanges are also businesses in their own right and aim to make profits from the services they provide. Crypto exchanges are also susceptible to market pressures and liquidity shortages. In the case of FTX, market speculation arose following a mass-sale of the cryptocurrency FTT (FTX\u2019s own native token), resulting in a classic bank run situation, with customers seeking to withdraw their cryptoassets from the exchange. FTX proved unable to fulfil the volume of customer withdrawal demands, and it quickly ceased processing withdrawals altogether. Shortly afterwards, Bankman-Fried resigned his position and administrators took control of the company\u2019s affairs and conducted an initial investigation into the state of business. The subsequent Bankruptcy filings made for sobering reading. These indicated that the total assets held could not be readily identified by the administrators, though were believed to be worth billions. As for the operation of the business itself, the administrator\u2019s findings were stark:\n\n\u201cMany of the companies in the FTX Group, especially those organized in Antigua and the Bahamas, did not have appropriate corporate governance. I understand that many entities, for example, never had board meetings\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FTX Group did not maintain centralized control of its cash. Cash management procedural failures included the absence of an accurate list of bank accounts and account signatories, as well as insufficient attention to the creditworthiness of banking partners around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Bahamas, I understand that corporate funds of the FTX Group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisors\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Debtors did not have the type of disbursement controls that I believe are appropriate for a business enterprise. For example, employees of the FTX Group submitted payment requests through an on-line \u2018chat\u2019 platform where a disparate group of supervisors approved disbursements by responding with personalized emojis\u2026\u201d\n\nAlmost overnight, FTX went from being the third largest crypto exchange globally to being all but wiped out. Millions of customers were left unable to access their funds, with no indication as to when \u2013 if at all \u2013 they could expect to recover their funds. On the back of this, Bankman-Fried was arrested and charged in the US for various counts of fraud and other activities, with a trial expected to take place in late 2023.\n\nThe impact of FTX\n\nIt is hard to understate the significance of the FTX collapse on the cryptocurrency industry. Some may ask how the failure of a single business can have such a significant impact on an industry in the way FTX has.\n\nThe answer to this perhaps lies in the fact that cryptocurrency remains a relatively new and emerging technology, with public knowledge and understanding being relatively limited, meaning that overall confidence and trust in the technology is not yet established. Furthermore, whilst there are a significant number of cryptocurrencies and business operating within the industry, public knowledge is typically limited to just a small number of these entities, which gives those particular businesses and assets a large amount of power within the industry. So, when one of these key market players fail, this alone can be significant in shaping opinions. Cryptocurrency also has an ongoing battle in fighting against a reputation as being a tool mainly used for illegal purposes, and so the initial findings published about the management of FTX inevitably adds fuel to this fire.\n\nIt is important to note at this stage that cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency exchanges are not one and the same \u2013 an exchange is an institution designed to enable the storage and exchange of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. It is not of itself an asset, although may issue its own forms of currency and digital tokens. In practical terms, however, the two are often grouped together within a wider concept of \u2018crypto\u2019, and so the failure of an exchange may often be perceived as an indictment of cryptocurrencies themselves.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the FTX collapse, other crypto exchanges began damage-control exercises to try and reassure their customers and re-establish market confidence. Some exchanges went to the extent of publishing their own accounts and proof of reserves, in order to convince customers that their assets were safe.\n\nThe fallout from FTX unsurprisingly caught the eye of governments and regulators. Less than two weeks following the collapse, the Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the Bank of England, Sir Jon Cunliffe, publicly spoke about FTX and the problems with cryptocurrencies as he saw them:\n\n\u201c\u2018Crypto\u2019 was born in unregulated space: indeed, part of the objectives of its early developers was to create a financial system outside regulation. While not yet of systemic scale, the crypto ecosystem has grown very rapidly in recent years and broadened to encompass a range of financial services.\n\nMoreover, it is not clear to what extent to which these platforms are truly decentralised. Behind these protocols typically sit firms and stakeholders who derive revenue from their operations. Moreover it is often unclear who, in practice, controls the governance of the protocols.\n\nMore generally, as with driverless cars, they are only as good as the rules, programmes and sensors which organise their operations.\u201d\n\nCritically, he also indicated that whilst the failure of a crypto exchange such as FTX was not presently enough to threaten wider financial markets, he did not wish to see a situation where such a scenario could happen, and so expressed support for an effective and robust regulatory framework for crypto.\n\nAs the year drew to a close, it seemed that fortunes had taken a significant downturn for cryptocurrency. The positivity surrounding the industry from earlier in the year and the UK\u2019s plan to build a \u201cglobal hub\u201d was in significant doubt.\n\n2023 onwards\n\nAs the dust has begun to settle following the events of FTX, 2023 has seen a number of developments take place which suggest crypto is on a gradual \u2013 if unsteady \u2013 road to recovery.\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nAt the start of February, the UK Government released the details of its plans to formally regulate cryptocurrency and digital assets, declaring \u201cwe remain steadfast in our commitment to grow the economy and enable technological change and innovation \u2013 and this includes cryptoasset technology.\u201d\n\nAs part of the announcement, the government opened up a public consultation and call for evidence in respect of its plans, which include proposals to categorise the acts of arranging and advising on crypto investments as regulated activities for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act (Regulated Activities) Order 2001, as well as bringing the marketing of cryptoassets and associated investments into the remit of the existing regulations on financial promotions.\n\nThe re-pledging of commitment towards cryptoassets was a welcome move for the industry, which had been left in a state of uncertainty following the FTX collapse and the criticisms raised by regulators in the aftermath.\n\nMarch 2023\n\nAs the public consultation for crypto regulation began, the FCA remained diligent in monitoring potentially illegal crypto activity, and issued details of recent crackdown operations it had overseen across the country in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police in respect of \u201cCrypto ATMs\u201d, which are machines allowing people to acquire crypto assets by depositing cash. The FCA has issued reminders that, at the time of writing, no businesses were registered or authorised to operate such machines.\n\nThis same month saw another significant development which may have inadvertently served to bolster crypto\u2019s fortunes. This was the collapse of the US-based Silicon Valley Bank (\u201cSVB\u201d). This was a bank which had typically focused on the technology sector, but which faced growing market uncertainty owing to various concerns about its investment strategy and liquidity, which culminated in another \u2018bank run\u2019 situation with customers seeking to withdraw their funds en masse, which the bank struggled to fulfil. UK customers were luckily safeguarded following action by the FCA which oversaw and approved the purchase of the bank\u2019s UK arm by HSBC. This prevented the need for any government bailouts, and helped to ensure UK customers were able to go about business as normal.\n\nNonetheless, the situation with SVB often looked to be comparable to what had been seen with FTX mere months earlier. This served as a reminder that even traditional financial institutions such as banks are not immune to financial pressures and can ultimately fail, resulting in potentially significant impacts on consumers. It showed that the issues which were seen with FTX were perhaps not down to any inherent risks or failures of cryptocurrency itself.\n\nMay 2023\n\nOn 17 May, the UK\u2019s Treasury Committee released a report setting outs its analysis of the crypto-asset industry and its views as to how future regulation should work. Whilst the Committee welcomed the government\u2019s proposals from earlier in the year for regulating the industry, it also made it clear that it considered unbacked cryptoassets such as Bitcoin to have no intrinsic value and serve \u201cno useful social purpose\u201d. It further expressed concerns that if the government regulated cryptoassets as a form of financial service, this risked giving consumers a false sense of security about the assets and could lead them to believe investments are safer than they are.\n\nThe Committee summarised its findings by saying it must \u201cstrongly recommend that the Government regulates retail trading and investment activity in unbacked cryptoassets as gambling rather than as a financial service.\u201d\n\nIn response, the trade association, CryptoUK, published a statement saying that it \u201cstrongly disagreed\u201d with the Committee\u2019s findings and considered them \u201cunhelpful, false, fundamentally flawed and unsubstantiated\u201d as a whole, and that it failed to \u201creflect the true nature, purpose and potential of the crypto industry\u201d. It did, however, confirm its willingness to work with and support the government\u2019s moves towards regulation and to engage with the FCA and Treasury to work to find solutions to some of the problems presented. These statements perhaps signify a potential for greater collaboration and communication between the industry and regulators in the future.\n\nJune 2023\n\nAt the start of June, the UK\u2019s All-Party Parliamentary Group for Crypto and Digital Assets issued its initial report following its inquiry into the topic of crypto regulation, which contained details of the submissions it had heard during the course of its investigations, along with making a series of recommendations for policymakers. In a stark contrast to the Treasury Committee\u2019s report from the previous month, this latest report talked about the practical benefits of crypto and made particular reference to how cryptocurrencies had been used by Ukranians to allow them to continue to buy goods and services even after infrastructures and ATMs were damaged due to the ongoing conflict. The report went on to talk about how the Government should aim to \u201charness the significant opportunities\u201d for economic growth arising from crypto, and emphasised the need to ensure regulators were given sufficient resources and skills to be able to properly understand the industry and to effectively regulate it.\n\nConclusions\n\nAs the events of the past year have shown, cryptocurrency remains incredibly unpredictable and it is in often hard to predict from one month to the next what developments will be seen.\n\n2022 was, in many respects, a positive year for the industry, particularly within the UK, thanks to the government\u2019s declarations of its ambitions for the use of digital assets. Whilst, it cannot be denied that the failure of FTX also caused the industry and its reputation to suffer significant damage, it does seem that this was also one of the key moments which served to spur governments and regulators to really move forward with their plans for regulation and the introduction of a proper legal framework for the industry, which can only prove beneficial in the long run and help the industry move it away from its \u201cWild West\u201d image.\n\nOverall, from the events of 2023 it does appear that crypto is on a gradual road to recovery following the events of FTX, and the UK in particular is clearly driving towards bringing about a full and robust regulatory framework for these assets. Whilst there will inevitably be further challenges on the way, the moves towards a proper regulatory framework may go a significant way to showing that crypto is here to stay and that the industry can learn the lessons it needs to from FTX, and allow cryptocurrency to continue to innovate and challenge financial norms in a way which will support individuals and investors alike.\n\nOur Financial Services team have expertise in Cryptocurrency and FTX, click through to find out how we can help your business.\n\nThe content of this page is a summary of the law in force at the date of publication and is not exhaustive, nor does it contain definitive advice.
