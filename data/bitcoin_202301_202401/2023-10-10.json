        "title": "What Grayscale's Victory in Bitcoin Case Means for Crypto Market - Bloomberg Law",
        "content": "The US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit grabbed the attention of legal and crypto communities when it ruled, in Grayscale Investments v. SEC, that the agency had acted unlawfully in denying Grayscale\u2019s application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund or ETF.\n\nAlthough the decision was a significant win for Grayscale and the crypto industry, commentators may have missed important nuance. The decision appears to reflect a technical application of standard administrative law doctrine\u2014and perhaps not, as commentators have assumed, a blanket rebuke of the SEC\u2019s reluctance to embrace crypto.\n\nGrayscale Decision\n\nThe case stems from the SEC\u2019s denial of Grayscale\u2019s application to list a spot Bitcoin ETF, versus a Bitcoin futures ETF, on a national exchange. An ETF is an investment vehicle designed to track an asset\u2019s value. While spot ETFs hold the asset itself, other ETFs hold derivates such as futures, which are contracts to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a later date.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision teed up a quintessential administrative law issue: whether the agency\u2019s action was \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d and therefore unlawful, under the Administrative Procedure Act or APA.\n\nIn a unanimous opinion, a three-judge panel ruled that the SEC\u2019s action was indeed arbitrary and capricious, as the agency\u2019s denial of Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF couldn\u2019t be squared with the agency\u2019s prior approvals of Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nAccording to the panel, the SEC\u2019s inconsistent treatment of the products violated a bedrock principle of administrative law: An agency must treat like cases alike.\n\nAlthough the SEC had attempted to thread the needle between them\u2014noting that Bitcoin futures ETFs enjoy superior market-surveillance and fraud-detection mechanisms compared with spot Bitcoin ETFs\u2014the panel rejected the SEC\u2019s proffered distinctions.\n\nFor both products, the panel observed, the relevant surveillance-sharing agreements were identical and equally likely to detect fraud. The panel also highlighted the SEC\u2019s failure to explain why fraud in the spot Bitcoin market was no obstacle to approving Bitcoin futures ETFs but was a basis to reject spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSignificant But Limited Victory\n\nSoon after, commentators celebrated the Grayscale decision as a resounding rebuke of the SEC\u2019s reluctance to embrace, if not hostility toward, the crypto industry. They particularly emphasized the panel\u2019s unanimity.\n\nThe opinion\u2019s Trump-appointed author, Judge Neomi Rao, had joined an Obama-appointee, Judge Sri Srinivasan, and a Carter appointee, Judge Harry Edwards, to rein in the SEC and safeguard crypto from the agency\u2019s power grab. Reports also seized on the harsh phrase that the panel had repeatedly employed to describe the SEC\u2019s conduct: \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nThen again, to quote former D.C. Circuit Judge Abner Mikva, \u201c\u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 is a term of art in the hands of a reviewing court and has connotations less pejorative than the plain meaning of the words would suggest.\u201d\n\nThe APA\u2019s arbitrary-and-capricious review, as US Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh explained, requires a court to \u201censure[] that the agency has acted within a zone of reasonableness and, in particular, has reasonably considered the relevant issues and reasonably explained the decision.\u201d\n\nPut simply by former Justice Byron White, the standard\u2019s touchstone is \u201creasoned decision-making.\u201d Across a broad array of subjects, courts have routinely applied this familiar formula to strike down agency actions as \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nFrom this perspective, the decision may not represent the resounding legal and political rout that the crypto community has deemed it. The case was technical, narrow, and the latest in a series of decisions reflecting methodical and dispassionate applications of APA arbitrary-and-capricious review.\n\nThe three panelists here\u2014Judges Rao, Srinivasan, and Edwards\u2014are known for their scholarly approaches to appellate judging and deep expertise in administrative law.\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nThe SEC may petition for a rehearing with all the D.C. Circuit\u2019s judges. But such en banc review requires a majority vote and is warranted only to \u201cmaintain the uniformity of the court\u2019s decisions\u201d or to resolve \u201cquestions of exceptional importance.\u201d It\u2019s doubtful the panelists\u2019 peers would view this straightforward case as a worthy candidate.\n\nThe SEC may also petition the Supreme Court for certiorari review. But even assuming that the panel erred, the court isn\u2019t in the business of mere error correction, and the decision\u2014a run-of-the-mill application of the APA\u2014doesn\u2019t appear to raise an issue that would move the court to exercise its jealously guarded certiorari jurisdiction. Nothing is certain, however.\n\nIf the SEC doesn\u2019t appeal the decision, it must comply. Yet the agency has room to maneuver. For example, the SEC could approve all spot Bitcoin ETF applications simultaneously\u2014not only Grayscale\u2019s, but also its competitors\u2019\u2014thus defeating any first-mover advantage.\n\nOr the SEC could deny Grayscale\u2019s application on an alternative ground. The SEC could even backtrack on its prior decision to approve Bitcoin futures ETFs. To comply with the equal-treatment principle, an agency need not equalize up\u2014it may also equalize down.\n\nSome of the Grayscale decision\u2019s biggest winners are conventional investors and their financial advisers.\n\nCompared with Bitcoin futures ETFs, spot Bitcoin ETFs permit investors to avoid roll costs\u2014those generated in a futures market after an investor rolls a short-term contract into a longer-term contract.\n\nAnd compared with directly purchasing Bitcoin, the ability to invest in a spot Bitcoin ETF might assuage investors, and their advisers, who seek exposure to Bitcoin but would find comfort in the familiarity of traditional investing.\n\nThis article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg Industry Group, Inc., the publisher of Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg Tax, or its owners.\n\n\n\nAuthor Information\n\nAndrew L.

        "title": "McLennan County resolves Bitcoin settlement after admitting funds seized in \u2018error\u2019 - KWTX",
        "content": "WACO, Texas (KWTX) - McLennan County officials have resolved a lawsuit that claimed sheriff\u2019s investigators unlawfully seized funds from a Bitcoin ATM after an 82-year-old Crawford woman reported scammers convinced her to convert $15,000 into Bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n\nLux Vending, which does business as Bitcoin Depot, agreed to dismiss the lawsuit and allow the woman to keep her money after McLennan County Judge Scott Felton admitted that the funds were seized \u201cin error\u201d and that it was premature for the sheriff\u2019s office to have returned the money to her.\n\nLux\u2019s lawsuit against the sheriff\u2019s office alleged investigators violated due process procedures when it obtained a search warrant to seize the money from one of its kiosk machines at a Sunoco store at 7500 Bosque Blvd. The suit also asked a judge to declare Bitcoin Depot the rightful owner of the cash.\n\nMcLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara, who said in June that his officers \u201cdid everything right\u201d and that Bitcoin Depot officials \u201ccan go to hell,\u201d declined comment Wednesday about the dismissal of the lawsuit. He also declined comment when asked about Felton\u2019s comments in a letter to Bitcoin Depot\u2019s chief operating officer that said the funds were seized in error.\n\nScott Buchanan, COO for Bitcoin Depot, said in a statement that the company cully cooperated with McLennan County law enforcement throughout the process. Buchanan reiterated Bitcoin Depot\u2019s \u201cdiligence in protecting its customers from illegal activity, cooperating with law enforcement officials to reach a resolution and enacting procedures to help identify and eliminate future bad actors seeking to take advantage of unsuspecting citizens.\u201d\n\nFelton did not respond to messages from KWTX on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe seizure of the money at that time was an error based on a misunderstanding that the funds belonged solely to the customer, not the company,\u201d Felton wrote in a letter to Bitcoin Depo obtained by KWTX. \u201c\u2026Due to the timing of the communication and the return of the funds happening at the same time, the money was not maintained by law enforcement officials and, instead, was provided to the victim.\u201d\n\nFelton wrote that because of a \u201cmisunderstanding and the difficulty in communication,\u201d McLennan County officials were not aware of the company\u2019s terms and conditions. He acknowledged the money no longer legally belonged to the customer at the time the cash was returned.\n\n\u201cThe release of the money to the McLennan County resident was based on a good faith belief that there were no competing claims for the legal interest of the money,\u201d Felton wrote. \u201cOfficials later determined that it was premature to have distributed the money which was seized for \u2018evidentiary purposes.\u2019\u201d\n\nFelton wrote he appreciated the company\u2019s cooperation in trying to identify the scammer.\n\nWaco attorney Mike Dixon, who represents the county, said Bitcoin agreed to dismiss the lawsuit and the woman got to keep her money. The county paid Bitcoin Depot nothing, he said.\n\n\u201cAll Bitcoin wanted was a letter showing they weren\u2019t the bad guys here, that they had procedures and warnings in place to try to stop this from happening and that they tell people not to send Bitcoin to wallets the person does not control,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cSo it was more about making it clear that Bitcoin Depot wasn\u2019t the scammer. This was a third-party international scammer and Bitcoin Depot was helpful in assisting and trying to locate the scammer.\u201d\n\nThe Crawford woman reported the elaborate scam to the sheriff\u2019s office on April 27, and a detective got a search warrant on May 3 to seize the money from the Bitcoin kiosk.\n\nAccording to the search warrant affidavit, the woman said she was online looking up cooking recipes when she received an email with a link to view a recipe. She clicked the link, which the affidavit said appears to have activated a \u201cRansomware\u201d computer virus.\n\nShe contacted \u201ccustomer support\u201d and was transferred to a \u201cfraud investigator,\u201d the affidavit states. She was told all her personal information had been compromised and that the fraud department could help her work through the problem.\n\nThe woman said she should contact her bank and law enforcement but was told it was not necessary because at that point, nothing had happened with her bank account and a \u201ccomputer virus\u201d was not something law enforcement would respond to, according to the affidavit.\n\nNext, the \u201cfraud investigator\u201d asked if she had written a check for a laptop. She said no, and the \u201cfraud investigator\u201d said a check just cleared the bank that someone wrote to pay for a laptop.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018fraud investigator\u2019 then told (the woman) he could see where a check was written to a construction company in the amount of $15,000, which had not cleared yet. (The woman) was then given instructions on how to prevent the loss of this amount of money,\u201d the affidavit states.\n\nThe woman was told to drive to her bank, make a $15,000 cash withdrawal and then go to the store and deposit it into the Bitcoin machine. She said she knew nothing about Bitcoin and told the man she was going to call law enforcement.\n\n\u201c(The woman) said the person on the phone stressed that essentially the longer she took to get the money out of the bank the closer the check could be to clearing,\u201d the affidavit says. \u201c(The woman) said she followed the instructions and that the guy stayed on the phone with her the entire time. (The woman) said she deposited $15,000, $100 at a time.\u201d\n\nMcNamara said in June the issue is no different than his agency recovering stolen cars, guns or four-wheelers and returning them to their rightful owners.\n\nCopyright 2023 KWTX.

        "content": "The high-tech phenomena of crypto-mining is spreading throughout the Natural State, and a recent proposal for a new facility near DeWitt, Arkansas, has locals up in arms.\n\nTuesday morning, the Arkansas County Quorum Court passed an amendment to make a noise ordinance aimed at crypto mines stricter.\n\nThere is a lot of spirit in DeWitt and Arkansas County as a whole, and the potential threats posed by a new crypto mine have brought local outcry to a fever pitch.\n\n\"This affects every single Arkansan in the state of Arkansas. We will no longer be the Natural State; we will be the Bitcoin State,\" said DeWitt business owner Jackie Johnson. \"And this is one of the only states that did not have Bitcoin mining. It's Sarah Huckabee Sanders and our legislature welcomed them [with] open arms. It's something else too, bitcoin miners are not little mom and pop businesses, they are big conglomerates that don't even live in the United States.\n\nWhen it was announced in July that the company Jones Digital planned on constructing a crypto mine next to DeWitt, locals became worried, having heard of crypto mine issues other towns around the state are already facing.\n\nConcerns range from power grid and water usage to environmental threats, hunting and agriculture being essential to the local economy.\n\n\"I'm here representing the farmers here concerning electricity and water. Two vital things that farmers need to survive and make a living. We don't want anything to jeopardize those in any way,\" said Kenneth Graves, chairman of the Arkansas Rice Growers Association.\n\nArkansas' government opened the door for crypto-mining businesses in the state with the recently signed into law Act 851, which severely limits the local government's ability to regulate crypto mines.\n\n\"The rest of the businesses and farmers that are in the area...we have to abide by regulations, we're regulated, we're taxed\u2014and this business is not. They're exempt from sales and use tax, and they're getting a cut-rate from Entergy because of the amount they use,\" said Tami Hornbeck, who owns a coffee shop in DeWitt.\n\n\"It just seems like our rights are being discriminated against and taken away in order for this one business to come in that's not going to provide jobs, it's not going to provide any economic benefit for our community,\" Hornbeck said.\n\nHornbeck and others have started a petition to prevent crypto mines from coming to Arkansas County\u2014after only two weeks, nearly half the town of DeWitt signed it.\n\nWith locals scrambling to find ways to keep out crypto mines, on Tuesday the county's Quorum Court made a noise ordinance (existing before Act 851 went into effect) stricter with an amendment, taking a stand with what may be seen as a violation of the new law.\n\n\"This is a gray area. And I do think there is a chance we will end up in court over this,\" said Tim Blair, prosecuting attorney for Arkansas County.\n\n\n\nDeWitt and other communities around the state facing unwanted crypto mines are asking for the governor to call a special session to re-evaluate Act 851."

Bitcoin received the majority of that investment, with $43 million in inflows over the week.\n\nHowever, Ether, the second most popular cryptocurrency, saw lackluster investment last week, according to CoinShares, even as six futures-based Ethereum ETFs launched in the U.S. In total, the new ETFs brought in just $10 million from investors. Ether\u2019s market dominance has also fallen to about 17% from 19% in January.\n\nComparatively, the first Bitcoin futures ETFs\u2014launched in the U.S. in 2021\u2014brought in $1 billion, although the CoinShares report noted that investor interest in digital currencies was much higher at that point compared to now.\n\nA bright spot for alternative currencies last week was inflows to Solana, a coin that was heavily endorsed by Bankman-Fried. The cryptocurrency notched its highest weekly inflows since March 2022, at $24 million, according to CoinShares.\n\nBitcoin and Ether were both down less than 1% on Tuesday afternoon. Bitcoin was trading around $27,300 and Ether around $1,500, according to CoinGecko."

        "content": "The most popular smart contract solutions in crypto are based on Ethereum, which provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s primary use case is as a store of value \u2014 digital gold \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, for payments, exemplified by the Lightning Network.\n\nBut new research shows how Taproot, Bitcoin\u2019s 2021 scripting upgrade, can dramatically increase the theoretical capabilities of the chain, potentially making it far more useful, even with no additional changes.\n\nA paper published by Robin Linus, whose non-profit ZeroSync recently completed a key component of a future zero-knowledge light client for Bitcoin, describes a so-called \u201cBitVM\u201d \u2014 which can be read as \u201cBitcoin Virtual Machine.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIt\u2019s essential to note that, unlike the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), BitVM doesn\u2019t execute computations on-chain but rather verifies them, similar to optimistic rollups.\n\nAs might be expected, Bitcoiners have been all a-twitter on the platform formerly known as\u2026let\u2019s just call it X.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the most exciting discovery in the history of bitcoin script,\u201d said Super Testnet, a pseudonymous software developer who reviewed the paper.\n\nEric Wall said he\u2019s \u201ccautiously excited, waiting for what the real-world experiments will yield.\u201d\n\nThe key innovation is that Bitcoin \u201cis able to be the trusted third party for an arbitrary [Turing] complete computation despite the fact bitcoin script is not able to actually execute it,\u201d according to the helpful explainer from software engineer Gregor Poga\u010dnik.\n\nDespite the theoretical implications, Poga\u010dnik doesn\u2019t believe Ethereum-like smart contracts are feasible.\n\n\u201cI believe this is quite cumbersome and likely not even the primary design goal,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s novel is that it could, and all without requiring any changes to Bitcoin\u2019s core software \u2014 no forks required.\n\nAn early practical application of the technology could be to decentralize the oracles for Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), according to Bob Bodily, CEO Bioniq, an ordinals marketplace.\n\nDLCs are a type of smart contract for Bitcoin that allows two parties to create bets or derivatives without requiring a trusted third party.\n\nBitVM could enhance the functionality, security, and versatility of DLC oracles by providing mechanisms for on-chain verification of oracle data, making them fully trustless.\n\nNot a panacea\n\nThere are limitations. BitVM is limited to two specific participants \u2014 a prover and a verifier \u2014 although there may be workarounds.\n\nBy contrast, Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts can involve multiple parties and can be executed by any user, making Ethereum more versatile for multi-party applications.\n\nOff-chain computation could lead to increased latency and complexity too.\n\nImagine you wanted to have the Bitcoin network enforce the rules of a chess game, for instance. If a given move requires an on-chain transaction (e.g., to resolve a dispute over its legality), then the players become subject to Bitcoin network\u2019s 10-minute average block confirmation time.\n\nYou can forget about blitz or rapid games, but such a system might be suitable for correspondence chess, where moves can be exchanged over days and chess engine use is de rigueur.\n\nSo, while BitVM introduces an innovative approach to bring Turing-complete contracts to Bitcoin, practical limitations may prove to undermine its utility.\n\nEven Blockstream CEO Adam Back was unimpressed, analogizing BitVM to 7-year-old research from Greg Maxwell during his tenure as Blockstream\u2019s technology chief.\n\nLinus responded that Back may have missed a few key differences that set BitVM apart.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThere also remains some debate over whether BitVM solves the problem of trustless bitcoin (BTC) bridging for sidechains. Bioniq\u2019s Bodily and others have doubts, but further research will make that clear.\n\nEthereum remains a more comprehensive platform for general-purpose smart contract development and execution. However, BitVM\u2019s approach could be valuable for specific use cases or for those who prioritize Bitcoin\u2019s security and decentralization properties.\n\nA Telegram group set up today anyone interested in BitVM has already attracted several hundred members. One commenter fairly succinctly summed up the importance of the concept:\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t require any change to bitcoin, but lots of work to make useful things with it.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: A Detailed Comparative Study - Clarion Ledger",
        "content": "William Mullane\n\nContributor\n\nAs the digital age moves ahead, the Bitcoin vs. Ethereum debate continues to captivate financial markets globally. Bitcoin enjoys worldwide recognition and the highest market cap in the industry, whereas Ethereum stands as a versatile contender, enriching the crypto ecosystem with its multifaceted functionality and solidifying its place as the second most valuable cryptocurrency. Investors, faced with the formidable task of selecting between these two titans, are in dire need of an in-depth comparison to make well-informed decisions. This is where this detailed article can bridge the information gap, providing you with the clarity required in this dynamic crypto race.\n\nWhat follows is a comprehensive comparison of the two, exploring their underlying technology, investment potential, and future prospects, delivering a compelling argument for prospective investors and blockchain enthusiasts alike.\n\nInitially, it is vital to recognize the foundational technology that underpins these cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, the vanguard of digital currencies, operates on a simple, unalterable blockchain technology, ensuring a secure, decentralized ledger for transactions. Its primary purpose is to serve as a digital substitute for traditional fiat currencies. Ethereum, conversely, expands upon this foundational blockchain concept by integrating \u201csmart contracts\u201d\u2014autonomous scripts that execute transactions when predefined conditions are met. This enables Ethereum to function not just as a currency but as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), thus providing a broader functionality.\n\nTransitioning from technology to investment potential, the inherent characteristics of both Bitcoin and Ethereum significantly influence their respective financial value. Bitcoin's greatest investment appeal lies in its scarcity; with a predetermined limit of 21 million bitcoins, it is often likened to \u201cdigital gold.\u201d This artificial scarcity has fueled its value, rendering Bitcoin an intriguing hedge against inflation. Ethereum, however, holds a different investment proposition through its potential for growth. As the fuel for dApps, its utility extends beyond being a mere currency, which could potentially lead to increased demand and, subsequently, value.\n\nSimultaneously, it's crucial to cast an analytical eye on the future prospects of these cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, with its robust security and simplicity, is steadily gaining acceptance as a viable form of payment, hinting toward a promising future. Yet, its lack of a broader technological use poses a challenge to its long-term relevance. Ethereum, on the other hand, is projected to undergo significant technological upgrades, such as the transition to Ethereum 2.0. This shift towards a more energy-efficient model, paired with its increasing utilization in the burgeoning field of decentralized finance (DeFi), suggests a future of endless possibilities.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently industry leaders, their future depends on a multitude of factors, including regulatory pressures, market sentiments, and technological advancements. However, it is crucial to remember that the world of cryptocurrency is replete with risk and unpredictability. Investors are strongly advised to conduct thorough research and consult with financial advisors before venturing into the turbulent seas of cryptocurrency investments.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum share the common foundation of blockchain technology, their purposes, investment potential, and future prospects diverge significantly. With its straightforward operation and scarcity-based value, Bitcoin offers a stable yet limiting experience. Ethereum's more complex and innovative approach provides a wider array of applications but requires a higher tolerance for potential volatility. Choosing between these two depends largely on an individual's investment goals and risk tolerance. If you're interested in staying informed about the latest developments in the cryptocurrency market, including the Ethereum price and Bitcoin price, it's suggested to follow reputable sources and stay up-to-date on market trends. As the crypto saga continues to unfold, these digital currencies\u2019 distinct characteristics will shape their respective journeys, influencing the future of the digital financial market.\n\nThis is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Everyone has heard about the 4-year cycle that Bitcoin is going through, but have you ever thought of the idea that Bitcoin might be going through a bigger cycle? And could this bigger cycle reflect the way humans adopt new technologies? And is it possible we have seen something similar before with another technology like the internet? In this article, we will be diving into a new theory that suggests that Bitcoin is moving through a larger 16-year cycle which can help us predict the direction of the Bitcoin price in the coming years.\n\nThe Regular 4 Year Cycle\n\nBitcoin tends to go through 4-year cycles which are divided into 2 parts, the uptrend and the downtrend. A regular 4-year cycle consists of a 3-year uptrend followed by a 1-year downtrend also known as a bear market. So far Bitcoin has completed 4-year cycles and they\u2019ve shown incredible accuracy which catches the attention of the market participants.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nThe DOTCOM Cycle\n\nOne can\u2019t ignore the similarities between the market structure of the S&P500 during the DOTCOM cycle and the Bitcoin cycle. The regular financial markets also went through clear 4-year cycles with the majority of the cycle being in an uptrend and the downtrend, also known as a bear market, shortly lived. From my perspective, the DOTCOM cycle started around 1986 as this was the moment that Microsoft went public, one of the biggest companies of the DOTCOM cycle. The first 3 4-year cycles of Bitcoin look very similar to the first 3 4-year cycles of the S&P500 starting from 1986.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nThis really spiked my interests as both periods are based on the adoption of a completely new technology that shifts the way our society perceives and uses information. The personal computer and the internet changed our lives completely to the point that it\u2019s almost unthinkable to be unconnected to the internet for more than 24 hours. In the future it will as well be unthinkable to not own and use any Bitcoin, we\u2019re just still in the early phase of its adoption.\n\nSo could the structure of the DOTCOM cycle help us to determine a potential path for Bitcoin? First of all, I would like to emphasize the fact that market cycles in my honest opinion are one of the best ways to use rough price predictions and ascertaining when to enter and when to exit a particular market. But I really want to emphasize the word \u201crough\u201d. There goes a saying, \u201chistory\n\ndoesn\u2019t repeat itself but it sure does rhyme\u201d, and I think this applies to cycles too. Nothing is ever a 100% replication of anything that happened before, but it can give us a rough estimate of what might happen.\n\nAs you can see in the structure of the DOTCOM cycle, the first 3 4-year cycles are very similar, a long bull market followed by a short but sometimes shallow bear market or correction. It's only that the last 4-year cycle is different, the tables are flipped upside down. It starts with an acceleration in the price which doesn\u2019t last that long and is followed by a multi-year long bear market. Could Bitcoin do something similar, disappointing the ones who expect a regular 4-year cycle and surprise the majority with a multi-year-long bear market?\n\nMicrosoft is following a similar path. It starts with 3 4-year cycles that are right-translated, followed by a 4-year cycle that is left-translated, so a prolonged bear market in an asset that has been in a strong bull market for years.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nMicrosoft topped in the year 2000, marking a long-term top in the price at approximately $60. And it wasn't until 2015 that that level was broken again. It took 15 years from that high to completely recover and surpass that level again. If we were to take the money supply into consideration it actually takes longer for Microsoft to recover and break the high 21 years later in May 2021.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nBoth of these charts, Microsoft and the S&P500, really demonstrate the magnitude of a correction after a prolonged bull-market. It\u2019s challenging to imagine from one's perspective a prolonged bear market of an asset you\u2019ve experienced mostly going up. Is it possible that we\u2019re going to see, in rough terms, something similar with Bitcoin?\n\nConfluence Between Cycles\n\nSo let\u2019s have a look at what these cycles are forecasting for Bitcoin and how we potentially could prepare for these outcomes. First of all, it's interesting to note that one date is forecasting the same outcome in the regular 4-year cycle, the 16-year cycle.\n\nA regular 4-year cycle would suggest that we\u2019re staying in an uptrend until 2025, followed by a 1- year decline. This is a typical 4-year cycle which we\u2019ve seen 3 times in the history of Bitcoin.\n\nThe 16-year cycle would suggest that we would follow a similar path as the DOTCOM bubble as mentioned above. Bitcoin would peak within the first half of the cycle, so by the latest at the end of 2024, this would be followed by a multi-year-long decline going into 2026 to form new lows.\n\nHow To Spot A Top\n\nOne of the best indicators a Bitcoin trader can use are the Bitcoin funding rates. The funding rates are showing basically whether the majority of the market participants on derivative markets are shorting or longing for Bitcoin. I\u2019ve found this indicator very useful to spot a top in the Bitcoin price as in a healthy bull market when the funding rates are negative, the price tends to trend up. In a bear market, when the funding is positive, the price tends to decline. So we can use this metric to spot which market conditions the market is trading in and if anything has changed. One of the first signals when Bitcoin entered a bear market in 2022 was that the price of Bitcoin was declining with negative funding rates, and that does generally not happen in a healthy bull market.\n\nAnother way to look for the cycle top is timing, whenever Bitcoin is in the period of topping for let\u2019s say the 16-year cycle and we break below a swing-low, chances increase that a cycle top is in. This would then be invalidated by breaking back above that specific level, to re-claim this level. To view the period of a potential cycle top, one can have a look at the Bitcoin cycles progression bars. Once the yellow dot enters the red zone, it means that based on that specific cycle we are in the topping period. Again, it is important to mention that cycles can help to give a rough estimate of potential outcomes, they often don\u2019t unfold very accurately and there is room\n\nFurther Considerations\n\nThere are more factors at play here that influence the price of Bitcoin other than these cycles. The fact that the Federal Reserve started to print huge amounts of money in 2020, really spiked the risk appetite for many investors to look for a safe haven like the financial markets and Bitcoin. It\u2019s very clear that the moment the Federal Reserve started to inject money into the economy, the price of Bitcoin and the financial markets started to go up until the money printer halted again in 2022 and the price of Bitcoin entered a 1-year declining phase. These fundamental changes in the economy will most likely have an impact on Bitcoin and the way these cycles could unfold.\n\nChart from Blockchain.com\n\nThis is a guest post by Jeroen van Lang.

        "title": "How Does Bitcoin & Crypto Fare During Geopolitical Events? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Geopolitical events are not uncommon in the global financial scene, and they frequently cause rippling effects in traditional markets. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have arisen as an alternative asset class in recent years, and their response to geopolitical turbulence has garnered substantial attention. We investigate how Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have historically performed during geopolitical events and whether they exhibit features that distinguish them from traditional investments during times of uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin: The Digital Gold Story\n\nBitcoin, also known as \"digital gold,\" has gained popularity as a potential safe-haven asset during geopolitical crises. According to this narrative, Bitcoin is analogous to gold in that it may be used as a store of value and a hedge against economic volatility.\n\nHistorically, when international tensions rise or traditional markets face difficulty, Bitcoin's price fluctuates. Some investors and analysts feel this demonstrates its growing importance as a risk-off asset. During such occasions, investors looking for alternatives to traditional financial instruments may turn to Bitcoin to diversify their portfolios.\n\nGeopolitical Unrest's Impact on Bitcoin: A Closer Look\n\nThe ongoing Middle East conflict is sending ripples through the crypto market. The war's extension into its fourth day has raised concerns about Bitcoin and other riskier assets.\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nGlobal market worries focus on the potential expansion of the conflict to nearby oil-producing countries, keeping investors on edge. This uncertainty has already affected the crypto market, causing a 2% dip on Monday due to surging oil prices and concerns about international trade.\n\nDespite this, there's a ray of hope for cryptocurrencies, which have shown early signs of resilience. Notably, they weathered the storm after previous geopolitical shocks, such as the aftermath of the U.S. imposing sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in March of the previous year.\n\nIt's essential to consider that Bitcoin and other digital assets can be significantly influenced by geopolitical conflicts. During such events, investors often turn to traditional safe havens like gold, while cryptocurrencies, seen as riskier, may face temporary setbacks.\n\nMonitoring oil and energy markets can provide insights into Bitcoin's future trajectory. Rising oil prices can trigger equity sell-offs and heighten expectations of tighter monetary policy, presenting risks to both Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.\n\nIn our interconnected world, global conflicts have far-reaching consequences, making it crucial for the crypto community to stay vigilant about the impact of geopolitical events on digital assets.\n\nCase Study: Bitcoin During the Trade War Between the United States and China\n\nThe trade war between the United States and China that raged between 2018 and 2020 is an important case study of Bitcoin's reaction to geopolitical events. As trade tensions rose, Bitcoin saw moments of increased price volatility. While it is too soon to declare Bitcoin a safe-haven asset, the correlation between escalating geopolitical tensions and Bitcoin price changes implies a possible link.\n\nDuring this time, Bitcoin gained increased interest from institutional investors and hedge funds wanting to diversify their portfolios amid market turmoil. This interest fostered the idea of Bitcoin as a geopolitical risk hedge.\n\nResilience of the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nAside from Bitcoin, the larger cryptocurrency market has shown resilience in the face of geopolitical events. While the market is recognized for its natural volatility, it has also demonstrated a strong tendency to recover rapidly after periods of instability.\n\nThe decentralized structure of cryptocurrencies is one probable explanation for their endurance. Cryptocurrencies, unlike traditional assets tied to specific governments or institutions, operate on decentralized networks, making them less vulnerable to the direct impact of geopolitical events.\n\n.\n\nFurthermore, cryptocurrency can provide individuals in economically troubled areas with a way to preserve their capital. In nations where there is currency depreciation, hyperinflation, or capital controls, cryptocurrencies can be a lifeline, allowing people to move and preserve their possessions.\n\nRegulatory Obstacles\n\nDespite the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies during geopolitical crises, they are nevertheless subject to regulatory scrutiny in a number of nations. Governments and regulatory agencies are concerned that cryptocurrencies are not utilized for illegal purposes such as money laundering or terrorism financing.\n\nAs investors react to news of prospective regulatory changes, this regulatory scrutiny may cause heightened volatility in bitcoin markets. Some say, however, that regulatory clarity and acceptance can ultimately help to legitimize and stabilize the bitcoin industry.\n\nThe Evolution of Cryptocurrency as a Financial Instrument\n\nCryptocurrencies are growing into increasingly sophisticated financial tools as geopolitical events continue to unfold. Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies tied to the value of fiat currencies, provide stability during market volatility. These digital assets have the potential to serve as a link between the existing financial system and the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, decentralized finance (DeFi) systems have grown in popularity, providing a wide range of financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading without the use of intermediaries. DeFi applications are available to everyone with an internet connection, making them especially useful in areas where traditional financial services are unavailable.\n\nVolatility vs. Long-Term Prospects\n\nIt is critical to recognize that cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are notorious for their volatility. While they may provide potential as safe-haven investments during geopolitical crises, their price swings can be significant and may not correspond with all investors' risk tolerance.\n\nSome regard this volatility as a short-term trait, while others focus on cryptocurrencies' long-term potential. Bitcoin's fixed quantity of 21 million coins, as well as its decentralized character, continue to entice many who believe it can serve as a long-term hedge against fiat currency depreciation and economic instability.\n\nDiversification Plan\n\nDiversification is a fundamental principle for investors considering cryptocurrencies as part of their portfolio. While cryptocurrencies may exhibit distinct features amid geopolitical events, they should be viewed as one component of a larger investment plan.\n\nBefore devoting a portion of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies, investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment objectives. Consultation with financial advisors or industry professionals can provide significant insights and help on incorporating cryptocurrencies into a diverse investment strategy.\n\nFinally, a Growing Asset Class\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies are still relatively new in the financial world, and their reaction to geopolitical events is continuously evolving. While they exhibit qualities that are consistent with the concept of safe-haven investments, their intrinsic volatility necessitates caution.\n\nCryptocurrencies may play an increasingly important role in providing investors with options during times of geopolitical turbulence as the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, regulatory clarity increases, and institutional usage grows. For the time being, they are a dynamic and evolving asset class that requires careful analysis within the context of investing strategy."

        "title": "If You're Expecting Bitcoin to Soar Before or After the Halving, You Need to Read This - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The next Bitcoin (BTC -2.38%) halving, set to take place in April 2024, is already shaping up to be one of the most anticipated crypto events of the year. Since previous Bitcoin halvings have led to huge rallies, Bitcoin bulls are already predicting another massive rally in 2024, with some suggesting that Bitcoin could skyrocket past the $100,000 mark.\n\nBut just how likely is this scenario? Based on Bitcoin's price performance after similar halving events in 2012, 2016, and 2020, there's certainly reason to be optimistic. But there are three key factors to consider before you go all in on Bitcoin.\n\nThe past performance fallacy\n\nPerhaps the biggest narrative surrounding the Bitcoin halving is that halving always pushes Bitcoin to another all-time high. Most recently, after the last halving event in May 2020, Bitcoin eventually reached its all-time high of $68,790 in November 2021. And the story was largely the same back in 2012 and 2016, when halving events catalyzed impressive bull market rallies.\n\nThus, any Bitcoin pricing model that relies on past data is probably going to tell you that Bitcoin is going to rally again in 2024. For example, crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital has analyzed the three previous Bitcoin halvings, crunched all the data, and concluded that Bitcoin is likely to surge to $36,000 by April 2024 before exploding in value to $149,000.\n\nBut remember: Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. And keep in mind that during the 2020 Bitcoin halving event, a lot of stimulus money was sloshing around a zero-interest-rate economy, and worldwide lockdowns were the norm.\n\nSupply and demand\n\nThe argument for a halving-induced rally focuses on the supply of Bitcoin. With any Bitcoin halving, the reward for mining a new Bitcoin block is also halved. As a result, the rate of supply of new Bitcoin is halved, introducing an element of scarcity. The scarcity effect means the price of Bitcoin should go up, provided demand stays the same or rises.\n\nBut what about the demand side of the equation? After all, Economics 101 tells us that the price of an asset is based on the intersection of supply and demand. The typical argument is that a halving event makes Bitcoin more deflationary, which boosts its attractiveness to investors seeking a hedge against inflation, which boosts demand. Fair enough.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the overall macroeconomic environment also affects demand. When interest rates are near zero, there's intense demand for risk assets. However, when rates rise, that makes risk assets relatively less appealing. Thus, the demand for a risk asset like Bitcoin typically falls during a rising-interest-rate environment, which is where we are now. In early October, a top Bloomberg strategist suggested that Bitcoin might actually crash to $10,000 if interest rates continue to rise.\n\nA \"lite\" halving?\n\nFinally, it's important to keep in mind evidence from cryptocurrencies similar to Bitcoin. Take Litecoin (LTC -2.25%), a proof-of-work crypto, just like Bitcoin. In fact, Litecoin was created using the Bitcoin source code, so it's possible to argue that Litecoin is a good proxy for modeling the impact of Bitcoin halvings.\n\nAnd the evidence from Litecoin is mixed, at best. Prior to this year, Litecoin had two halvings, in 2015 and 2019. And, as can be seen from Litecoin's trading chart, it's impossible to pinpoint an obvious sustained rally in either instance. And then, in August of this year, Litecoin had another halving. This was supposed to send Litecoin soaring, only it didn't. Litecoin is actually down 9% for the year.\n\nWhat to do about Bitcoin price predictions?\n\nPerhaps the best advice for crypto investors is to take any Bitcoin halving price prediction with a grain of salt. The closer we get to the actual halving event, the more inflated these price predictions could become. The conventional wisdom is that Bitcoin will eventually test its all-time high of $68,790 after the next halving. More aggressive estimates call for Bitcoin to hit the $100,000 mark and beyond.\n\nBut what if we only get a Bitcoin halving \"lite\" next year? If you take a much more conservative view, Bitcoin might increase in value by only 25%, which is approximately how much it increased in the first 150 days after the 2020 halving. If you're counting on a huge surge in value for Bitcoin in 2024, you may be disappointed."

        "content": "Love him or hate him, when Arthur Hayes speaks, people listen.\n\nLast week, as a guest on Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Hayes made the case for why he believes Bitcoin (BTC) price will hit $750,000 to $1 million by 2026.\n\nHayes said:\n\n\u201cI absolutely agree that there is going to be a major financial crisis, probably as bad or worse than the great depression, sometime near the end of the decade; before we get there, we\u2019re gonna have, I think, the largest bull market in stocks, real estate, crypto, art, you name it, that we\u2019ve ever seen since WW2.\u201d\n\nHayes cites the nearly predictable response of the United States government rushing in to intervene in every economic crisis with a bail-out as a key catalyst behind the structural problems in the U.S. economy.\n\nHe explained that this essentially creates an endless cycle of central bank printing, which leads to inflation and prevents the economy from going through natural market cycles of growth and correction.\n\n\u201cWe all have collectively agreed that the government is there essentially to attempt to remove the business cycle. Like, there should never be bad things that happen to the economy, and if there are, we want the government to come in and destroy the free market. So, every time we\u2019ve had a financial crisis over the past 80 years. What happens? The government rushes in, and they essentially destroy some part of the free market because they want to save the system.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at a few of the catalysts that Hayes believes will back Bitcoin\u2019s move into six-figure territory.\n\nMounting debt and out of control inflation.\n\nAccording to Hayes, mounting government debt, a large amount that needs to be rolled over and diminishing productivity can only be addressed with money printing. While monetary expansion does lead to bull markets, the consequence tends to be high inflation.\n\n\u201cIn the first instance, it creates a massive bull market in stocks, crypto, real estate, things that have a fixed supply, maybe they\u2019re productive and have some earnings. But after that, we\u2019re going to find out that, actually, the government can\u2019t save everything. It can\u2019t just print as much money as they think to try to save themselves by fixing the yield and price of their bonds, and we\u2019re going to get a generational collapse.\u201d\n\nHayes expects a \u201cmassive top\u201d at some point in 2026, followed by a great depression-like situation by the end of the decade.\n\nThe U.S. government bankrupted the banking system\n\nWhen asked about future contributors to inflation, Hayes zoned in on the $7.75 trillion in U.S. debt that must be rolled over by 2026 and the yield curve inversion in U.S. bonds.\n\nTraditionally, China, Japan and other nations were the main buyers of U.S. debt, but this is not the case anymore \u2014 a change that Hayes believes will exacerbate the situation in the states.\n\nWhy do I love these markets right now when yields are screaming higher?\n\n\n\nBank models have no concept of a bear steepener occurring. Take a look at the top right quadrant of historical interest rate regimes.\n\n\n\nIt's basically empty. pic.twitter.com/P6MQnCU73N \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) October 4, 2023\n\nAccording to Hayes, \u201cthe U.S. banking system is functionally insolvent because the regulators made the rules in such a way that it was profitable from an accounting perspective, not an economic perspective, to essentially take in deposits and buy low-yielding Treasurys, and they could do it with almost infinite leverage and a few basis points differing in the change of the price, and everyone makes a lot of money and gets a big bonus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe banks collectively bought all these treasuries in 2021, and obviously, the price went down a lot since then, and that\u2019s why we have the regional banking crisis.\u201d\n\nThe largest concern expressed by Hayes is that \u201cat a structural level, the U.S. banking system cannot buy more debt because it cannot afford to because it is structurally insolvent. The Federal Reserve has committed to doing quantitative tightening, so it\u2019s not accumulating more Treasurys.\u201d\n\nHayes explained that the market is digesting this, and the nuance here is that despite high rates on U.S. Treasurys, gold prices remain high and certain market participants who previously were treasury buyers are disinterested.\n\nCurrently, banks struggle to attract deposits, and the difficulty of matching their deposit rates to the current rates available in the market creates revenue and debt management stress at a level that could become critical to the function of the entire banking system. Like many cryptocurrency advocates, Hayes believes that it\u2019s in times like this that a certain cohort of investors begins to look at different investment options, including Bitcoin.\n\nHayes\u2019 view on why Bitcoin is destined for $750,000\n\nDespite what appears to be a generally dismal outlook on the global and U.S. economy, Hayes still expects Bitcoin price to outperform, placing a target estimate in the $750,000 to $1 million range by the end of 2026.\n\nHayes expects Bitcoin to continue:\n\n\u201cChopping around $25,000 to $30,000 this year as we get to some sort of financial disturbance and people recognize that real rates are negative. If the economy is growing at a nominal rate of 10%, but I\u2019m only getting 5% or 6%, even though it\u2019s high, people on the margin are going to start buying other stuff, crypto being one of those things.\u201d\n\nComing into 2024, Hayes said either a financial crisis will push rates closer to 0%, or the government will keep raising rates, but not as fast as governments spend money and people continue looking for better returns elsewhere.\n\nThe eventual approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S., Europe and perhaps Hong Kong, plus the halving event, could push the price to a new all-time high at $70,000 in June or July of 2024. Regaining the all-time high by the end of 2024 is when the \u201creal fun starts and the real bull market starts,\u201d and Bitcoin enters the \u201c750,0000 to $1 million on the upside.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether the estimated price level would stick, Hayes agreed that a 70% to 90% drawdown would occur in BTC price, just like it has after each bull market.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

He spoke to someone claiming to be an employee of Microsoft online services and was allegedly told that fraudulent activity had been detected in his Bank of America account.\n\nThe Chandler man was allegedly told to move his assets to a more \"secure\" location like a bitcoin ATM located inside a liquor store on Arizona Avenue, records show.\n\nScammers using cryptocurrency ATMs and QR codes to dupe money out of people has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, according to the FBI. It can be more difficult for law enforcement to recover funds exchanged through this type of transaction so the FBI advises citizens to be cautious of entities demanding cryptocurrency as payment.\n\nThe man in Chandler allegedly deposited about $60,000 into the bitcoin ATMs before he objected to the process and then was instructed to make alternative forms of payment.\n\nRecords show the man placed $40,000 in a cardboard box and was told to give the box to a woman who later visited his neighborhood.\n\nThe following day, the man was contacted again and encouraged to buy up to $78,000 in gold from a local jewelry shop. After buying the gold coins, the Chandler man would get instructions on how to hand off the gold.\n\nAfter Chandler police were contacted, they decided to create a \"bait package\" containing a GPS device that would be delivered to the unknown person picking up the gold.\n\nOn Oct. 9, the Chandler man was told to meet someone at a location and hand off the parcel. Undercover detectives then trailed the car that picked up the package and followed it to a local hotel, records show.\n\nPolice eventually conducted a traffic stop and detained two men. Court records identify the individuals as 24-year-old Jeet Panchal and 28-year-old Farhan Shaikh.\n\nIn an interview with police, Shaikh allegedly told investigators that Panchal had agreed to pay him $200 for a ride to Arizona. He denied having knowledge about the package picked up by the other suspect.\n\nBoth men were booked into jail and are facing charges of theft and fraud.\n\nA list of common scams involving bitcoin ATMs can be found here."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s layer 2 Lightning Network has seen an estimated 1,212% growth in two years, with around 6.6 million routed transactions in August, a significant jump compared with August 2021\u2019s 503,000 transactions, according to data from the Bitcoin (BTC)-only exchange River.\n\nIn an Oct. 10 report, River research analyst Sam Wouters explained the jump in routed transactions \u2014 which use more than two nodes to facilitate a transfer \u2014 came despite a 44% fall in Bitcoin\u2019s price and considerably less online search interest.\n\n\u201c\u2018Nobody is using Lightning\u2019 should now be a dead meme,\u201d Wouters said in an Oct. 10 follow-up X (formerlyTwitter) post, taking a shot at Lightning critics.\n\n\u201cNobody is using Lightning\u201d should now be a dead meme.\n\n\n\nLaunching a new #Bitcoin report from @River: How the Lightning Network grew by 1212% in 2 years \u26a1\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s time to pay attention to the incredible work of so many people in the space Link below in the pic.twitter.com/FuGLwGHR4R \u2014 Sam Wouters (@SDWouters) October 10, 2023\n\nRiver\u2019s 6.6 million figure for Lightning-routed transactions is a lower-bound estimate \u2014 the smallest possible value it could assess. The firm also sourced August 2021\u2019s 503,000 figure from a 2021 study by K33, formerly Arcane Research, and added it could not assess private Lightning transactions or those between only two participants.\n\nEstimated growth of monthly routed Bitcoin Lightning transactions. Source: River\n\n$78.2 million in transaction volume was also processed on Lightning in August 2023, marking a 546% increase from August 2021\u2019s $12.1 million figure sourced by K33. Wouters noted that Lightning is now processing at least 47% of Bitcoin\u2019s on-chain transactions.\n\n\u201cThis will be an interesting metric to monitor,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is an indicator of Bitcoin becoming more of a medium of exchange.\u201d\n\nEstimated growth of monthly routed Bitcoin Lightning transaction volume. Source: River\n\nIn August 2023, the average Lightning transaction size was around 44,700 satoshis or $11.84. River estimated between 279,000 and 1.1 million Lightning users were active in September.\n\nThe firm attributed 27% of transaction growth to the gaming, social media tipping and streaming sectors.\n\nRelated: Coinbase to integrate Bitcoin Lightning Network: CEO Brian Armstrong\n\nRiver said the Lightning payments success rate was 99.7% on its platform in August 2023 across 308,000 transactions. The main reason for failure occurs when no payment route can be found that has enough liquidity to facilitate the transfer.\n\nRiver\u2019s data set consisted of 2.5 million transactions.

        "content": "The Canadian Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Hut 8 continues to accumulate self-mined BTC amid the ongoing merger deal with the industrial cryptocurrency miner, US Bitcoin (USBTC).\n\nHut 8 mined 111 Bitcoin in September 2023, bringing its self-mined BTC reserves to 9,366 Bitcoin, the firm announced on Oct. 10.\n\nThe amount of Bitcoin mined by Hut 8 in September is up around 8% from the previous month but is still significantly lower than in May 2023 when Hut mined 147 BTC. The Bitcoin miner has seen its mining pace drop significantly over the past year, as its monthly mining volumes dropped nearly 60% from 277 BTC mined in September 2022.\n\nBut despite seeing a notable decline in the amount of monthly-mined Bitcoin, Hut 8 has remained committed to its hodl strategy, which has not been seen among too many miners in the industry.\n\n\u201cNo Bitcoin was sold during the month,\u201d Hut 8 said, stressing that the company owns one of the largest self-mined BTC reserves among publicly traded firms. \u201cTotal balance of Bitcoin in reserve was 9,366 on September 30 \u2014 7,269 of which were unencumbered,\u201d the firm added.\n\nHut 8\u2019s latest BTC reserve expansion comes in line with the company\u2019s long-term hodl strategy. Unlike many crypto miners forced to sell at least part of their mined Bitcoin holdings amid tough market conditions, including firms like Core Scientific and Riot Blockchain, Hut 8 has continued to steadily increase its Bitcoin stash. As of September 2022, Hut 8 had about 8,000 BTC in its reserves.\n\nIn the announcement, Hut 8 also mentioned the success of its ongoing merger deal with USBTC. Announced in February 2023, the transaction is expected to create a new Bitcoin mining business called Hut 8 Corp, or \u201cNew Hut.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitfarms increases mining pace, generates 411 BTC in September\n\nIn September 2023, Hut 8 and USBTC obtained final approval from the Supreme Court of British Columbia for the merger deal.\n\n\u201cProgress toward completing our transaction with USBTC continues, and we\u2019re grateful to our shareholders who demonstrated their overwhelming support by voting in favor of the merger,\u201d Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton said. He added that the recent approval from the Canadian court allows the firm to \u201ccontinue to advance us toward a new Hut 8,\u201d which will have \u201chighly diversified fiat revenue streams.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Web3 Gamer: Minecraft bans Bitcoin P2E, iPhone 15 & crypto gaming, Formula E"

If implemented, it would allow \u201csidechains\u201d to be built on the network.\n\nOn Oct. 9, Bitcoin developer Robin Linus released a white paper titled \u201cBitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin,\u201d which details how Ethereum-like optimistic rollup smart contracts could be made on the Bitcoin network.\n\nRelated: El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoiners teach 12-year-olds how to send sats\n\nUnlike the Spiderchain, BIP-300 would require Bitcoin to soft fork and would be activated by miners \u2014 similar to the Taproot soft fork in November 2021 that paved the way for the NFT-emulating Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens.\n\nThe BIP\u2019s creator, Paul Sztorc, says those favoring BIP-300 believe it will offer new privacy and scaling use cases to Bitcoin, among other benefits.\n\nSo far at @tabconf:\n\n\n\n* Many pro Bip300 -- popular usecases are Privacy, Scaling, and experimentation (get new OP codes now)\n\n* Very popular question is: when is my debate with Peter Todd (Friday at 2 PM)\n\n* Many complained about off-base Twitter dialog and nonsense propaganda\n\n*\u2026 \u2014 Paul Sztorc (@Truthcoin) September 7, 2023\n\nHowever, not everyone likes the idea of expanding Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem beyond its current use cases.\n\nCory Klippsten, the CEO of BTC-only exchange Swan Bitcoin, believes drivechains and solutions that bring other assets to Bitcoin will bring an influx of scammers.\n\nSaifedean Ammous, the author of The Bitcoin Standard, opposes the idea of issuing altcoins on Bitcoin, suggesting that \u201cgood money\u201d is the only token needed.\n\nPeople only think tokens are a good idea because we live in a world of broken money.

Based on work by Valery Santillana via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nTargeting high water use, energy waste, and round-the-clock noise, skeptics are challenging Bitcoin efforts in Navarro County and the state of Texas, the author of \u2018Let Them Eat Crypto\u2019 writes.\n\nPeter Howson\n\nTexas loves crypto. At least, that\u2019s what you\u2019d think listening to the deafening drone of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin mining hubs springing up across the state. They run at around 85 decibels. The noise is equivalent to having a hair dryer blowing full power next to your face 24/7.\n\nCrypto mining globally is responsible for using a big, developed country\u2019s worth of electricity every year. The industry spits out thousands of tons of burned-out e-waste and toxic \u201cforever chemicals.\u201d These are the cancer-causing fluids that never break down, but are used and dumped without remorse to cool noisy Bitcoin machines.\n\nOver the last two years Texas has overtaken China as the global Bitcoin superpower. Using mainly gas and coal, no other jurisdiction on Earth creates more crypto than the Lone Star state.\n\nTexas has always had a haphazard approach to keeping the lights (and Bitcoin machines) on. Unlike most other US states\u2014which benefit from integration with the Eastern or Western Interconnections power grids\u2014Texas operates its own grid and is uniquely vulnerable to poor energy planning. When the lights go out here, people die. After hundreds died from hypothermia during a winter storm in 2021, US regulators recommended urgent upgrades to ensure the Texas network\u2019s reliability in extreme weather conditions. The recommendations were ignored.\n\nWith an increasing body count, in 2022 the state grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), devised a new energy management strategy. To prepare for more frequent and severe weather events caused by climate change, Texas would turn to Bitcoin.\n\nThe reason given for the seemingly bizarre energy policy was \u201cload balancing.\u201d Bitcoin miners escaping from corrupt regimes overseas (otherwise known as countries with environmental laws) promised to \u201cstabilize\u201d the Texas grid. These incoming Bitcoiners negotiated 10-year fixed-supply agreements, paying around 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity pulled from the grid. The going residential rate is 18.5 cents.\n\nA \u201cdemand\u2013response program\u201d would enable power suppliers to ask Bitcoiners to shut down their operations when demand across the grid was high. If they did so voluntarily, ERCOT would pay the company credits towards future power. Miners from all over the world flocked to Texas enticed by the low energy prices and lax environmental regulation. As of mid-2023, the state was home to around 10 percent of all the world\u2019s Bitcoin miners, who together were adding 20,000 megawatts of demand to the Texas grid. That\u2019s roughly equal to the amount of electricity used by the whole of Houston.\n\nHeatwaves have brought \u201dexceptional drought\u201d conditions to much of Texas\u2014the highest categorization of dryness\u2014denoting \u201cwidespread crop loss, dead rangeland, producers not planting fields, forestry, tourism, and agriculture sectors reporting significant financial loss, and extreme sensitivity to fire danger.\u201d Last year, hundreds of Texans suffered heat-related deaths. Many endured rolling blackouts.\n\nMeanwhile in Rockdale, Texas, Riot Platforms\u2014owners of the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin-mining center\u2014were sucking up millions of gallons of cool fresh water.\n\nAlexa Neuendorf, Kimberlee Walter, Jackie Sawicky, and Monica Vickery protest the arrival of bitcoin mining in Navarro County, Texas. Image: John Blewitt\n\nThe huge amount of electricity Riot needs is enough to power every home in the county ten times over. One Texas-based activist, Jackie Sawicky, told me that the additional water demand would be enough to fill two Olympic-sized swimming pools every day. \u201cThese people are parasites,\u201d Sawicky said.\n\n\u201cRiot spoke to us at a town hall meeting. They were honest. They said, \u2018You people have two very important things for Riot: water and the Navarro County electrical switching station.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Bitcoiners were there to fix the grid without the need for government interference. \u201cA lot of people view Bitcoin as a consumer of energy,\u201d said Cruz at an event in October 2021. \u201cThe perspective I\u2019m suggesting is very much the reverse, which is [using Bitcoin] as a way to strengthen our energy infrastructure.\u201d\n\nFor Sawicky, the Bitcoiners\u2019 intentions were clear: \u201cThey\u2019re coming here to exploit the shit out of us,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to energy management services firm Voltus, miners relocating to Texas could generate up to 10 percent of their total revenue from demand-response credits. Credits would be paid to miners from the bills of residential customers who would in turn see their rates rise by an estimated five percent. Today, ordinary Texans are reportedly subsidizing the profits of Bitcoin miners to the tune of $1.8 billion every year. Some of the Bitcoin miners benefiting from Cruz\u2019s crypto policy weren\u2019t even in Texas.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s finally found a real-world use-case for crypto-currency: NOT mining it,\u201d Tweeted MSNBC news host Chris Hayes in response to news that ERCOT was paying Bitcoiners in Colorado $13 million to switch off their machines.\n\nIt\u2019s worth bearing in mind that across the U.S., you are more likely to be killed by a hamster than you are to come across a business accepting payment in crypto.\n\nIn my new book, Let Them Eat Crypto: The Blockchain Scam That\u2019s Ruining the World, I explain how this technology\u2014one that virtually no one uses\u2014comes with huge costs for communities and the environment.\n\nCryptocurrencies are gambling tokens. Other than naive speculation, they are used almost solely for ransomware, extortion, and sanctions evasion. It is no surprise that many in Texas have had enough of it.\n\nThe growing groundswell of opposition to Bitcoin here is thanks in part to action by local pressure group, Concerned Citizens of Navarro County. This October, the group is launching a Week of Action to raise awareness of the huge costs ordinary Texans are paying for crypto. The outreach events are supported by the environmental advocacy organization Greenpeace.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been arranging town hall meetings and block walking every weekend\u201d, Sawicky tells me. \u201cThere\u2019s a real sense of hope and momentum. This is people power.\u201d\n\nTexas is the epicenter for what is perhaps the most purposefully polluting industry in the world today. While the negative impacts of asbestos toothpaste and leaded gasoline were once a byproduct of something useful, the same cannot be said for the wasted resources from the crypto industry. Luckily there\u2019s a growing grassroots movement standing up to it.\n\n-30-\n\nPeter Howson is a technology writer, researcher, and assistant professor in international development.

        "title": "The economy is surging, which means it might be time to start buying Bitcoin - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The United States economy seems like it is refusing to be derailed. It added a staggering 336,000 jobs in September, defying most expectations. This achievement becomes all the more remarkable against the backdrop of soaring yields on longer-term Treasury bonds and surging mortgage rates.\n\nThe message embedded in the job data is crystal clear: the world\u2019s largest economy continues to charge forward, even in the face of aggressive monetary tightening. It\u2019s a testament to the economy\u2019s resilience, and suggests that higher interests are here to stay for an extended period.\n\nWhile this news could send shivers down some spines, particularly for those invested in stocks, it\u2019s crucial to understand the bigger picture. Stocks may appear less enticing when you can secure a 6% return with a savings account, yet we may be reaching an inflection point with bonds.\n\nIt has to get worse before it gets better\n\nThe bond market has witnessed a historic rout, described by Bank of America Global Research as the \u201cgreatest bond bear market of all time.\u201d But the analysis isn\u2019t all doom and gloom \u2014 there are hints that the relentless sell off in U.S. Treasuries could come to an end. And if we do indeed see a recovery, it could signal the start of a new bull market for risk assets.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: A $600B tipping point for crypto\n\nTurning to crypto, it\u2019s crucial to recognize that short-term Bitcoin (BTC) price action remains somewhat linked to regulatory decisions, particularly those pertaining to a Bitcoin spot ETF. So far, all of the positive news surrounding spot ETFs has failed to move Bitcoin out of its holding pattern. A green light on this front could unleash substantial inflows into BTC, providing the much-awaited impetus for a resurgence. It would also be remiss not to mention the ongoing FTX saga, which is currently playing out in the courts and damaging crypto\u2019s reputation.\n\nUnited States Federal Funds Effective Rate, 1955-2023. Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist \u2014 what may spell bad news for financial markets could be good for the broader economy. The Federal Reserve holds a pivotal role in shaping the path for risk assets, and it has just two more meetings before the end of the year. Should the Fed decide to suspend further rate hikes, it could act as a catalyst, triggering market anticipation of an impending rate cut. This anticipation could, in turn, set the stage for a massive risk-on rally across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nFestive revelry could set the tone for 2024\n\nThe last three months of the year often introduce a heightened Santa rally. After the year we\u2019ve had, it might soften the blow and pave the way for a more palatable 2024. History shows that the market tends to gather momentum during this festive season, with a surge in buying activity and positive sentiment among investors. Among these factors, regulatory decisions regarding spot ETFs and any potential pause in rate hikes, or even a shift in the Fed\u2019s messaging concerning future hikes will be watched closely. So while the cheer from September\u2019s jobs data tends to drive immediate headline moves in the market, it doesn\u2019t necessarily steer the long-term thinking of the Fed.\n\nRelated: Sky-high interest rates are exactly what the crypto market needs\n\nLooking ahead into 2024, we are faced with the prospect of a BTC \u201chalvening\u201d in April, historically a positive event for crypto. However, the broader macroeconomic conditions have signalled some signs of instability. Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing correlation with stock markets adds an extra layer of complexity to the equation. The outcome hinges on the messaging from the Fed \u2014 and decisions made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding spot ETFs. If the macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain, the Fed may pivot toward rate cuts, potentially altering the trajectory of both traditional and digital asset markets.\n\nWith hints of a bond market recovery and the prospect of regulatory clarity in the crypto space, we could see brighter days ahead. As we approach the festive season, the potential for a Santa rally rekindles the type of hope and momentum that ignites the crypto market. While some challenges may loom, history teaches us that sometimes, it gets worse before it gets better.\n\nLucas Kiely is chief investment officer of Yield App, where he oversees investment portfolio allocations and leads the expansion of a diversified investment product range.

        "content": "William Mullane\n\nContributor\n\nCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have taken the financial world\u2019s interest, offering a possible alternative to traditional fiat currencies. However, the volatility of Bitcoin, coupled with its nascent status, presents a veritable minefield for potential investors. This article seeks to illuminate some key factors affecting Bitcoin's value and offers insights on what investors should vigilantly monitor.\n\n1. Market Demand and Adoption: Cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin, hinge on market acceptance. As more businesses, consumers, and investors embrace Bitcoin, its value appreciates. The integration of Bitcoin into major financial institutions, from PayPal to Fidelity, indicates a growing adoption curve. However, investors need to be wary. While acceptance is growing, it is not universal. Regulatory scrutiny, a lack of understanding, and technological barriers can limit broader market adoption, affecting Bitcoin's price.\n\n2. Regulatory News and Policies: Regulatory decisions significantly sway Bitcoin's value. Governmental regulations worldwide fluctuate widely, from outright bans to wholehearted endorsements. Any news of stringent regulations or bans can result in a substantial sell-off, leading to a decline in Bitcoin's price. Conversely, supportive regulatory climates can encourage investment and usage, driving prices upwards. Investors need to stay abreast of the latest regulatory developments across the globe and understand the implications on their Bitcoin holdings.\n\n3. Technological Developments: Bitcoin's open-source nature means constant evolution and improvement. Technological advancements, such as the Lightning Network, enhance scalability and usability, making Bitcoin more appealing to a broader audience. However, potential technological vulnerabilities or security breaches can impact investor confidence, leading to price fluctuations. Consequently, a grasp of the current technological landscape and future developments is crucial.\n\n4. Macroeconomic Factors: Bitcoin's price is susceptible to macroeconomic movements. Inflation, geopolitical unrest, financial crises, and shifts in investor sentiment can all lead to Bitcoin price volatility. The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing economic instability recently led many investors to consider Bitcoin a potential \"digital gold,\" driving up the value. Investors need to be cognizant of the broader macroeconomic environment and understand how these elements may influence Bitcoin's value.\n\n5. Bitcoin Halving: This unique factor related to Bitcoin's supply happens approximately every four years, halving the rewards that miners receive for validating transactions and creating new Bitcoins. Historically, these halving events have led to substantial price increases due to the supply-demand dynamics. Investors should be aware of when the next halving will occur and understand its potential impact on Bitcoin's price.\n\nNavigating the Bitcoin market can be likened to traversing a labyrinth filled with untold riches and potential pitfalls. Each turn represents a factor that could significantly alter the landscape. The key to successful navigation lies in understanding these factors \u2013 market demand and adoption, regulatory news and policies, technological developments, macroeconomic factors, and the Bitcoin halving.\n\nThe cryptocurrency world remains a volatile and uncertain one. By gaining a solid grasp of these factors, investors can equip themselves with the tools necessary to make informed decisions, thereby mitigating potential risks and maximizing rewards. It is crucial to approach this dynamic arena with a calculated strategy informed by an understanding of these parameters.\n\nAs an investment vehicle, Bitcoin offers significant opportunities and challenges. It is a complex asset class that requires vigilance, understanding, and a keen eye for detail. By understanding the factors affecting its value, investors can avoid the proverbial mines and chart a course through the exciting world of Bitcoin investment.\n\nThis is for informational purposes only.

In the digital sphere, they leveraged mobile phones and internet connections to broadcast their actions globally. But, the burning question is, where did the money for all this come from?\n\nCryptocurrency. Yes, you heard it right. The darling of the decentralized financial world, crypto, has a dark side, too. It's not just a tool for rebellious libertarians or tech-savvy traders; it's also the secret weapon of militant groups.\n\nHuge Seizures\n\nIn August 2020, the US government managed to seize millions of dollars from a number of groups that had been using crypto to fund their activities. But, here's the shocker: Palestinian Islamic Jihad, one of the groups responsible for seizing Israeli hostages, still managed to collect a staggering $93 million worth of cryptocurrency between June 2021 and August 2023, according to the WSJ. Hamas, the heavyweight of Palestinian groups, also raked in around $41 million in digital payments Payments One of the bases of mediums of exchange in the modern world, a payment constitutes the transfer of a legal currency or equivalent from one party in exchange for goods or services to another entity.

And, here's a staggering figure to chew on \u2014 the UN estimates that crypto accounts for a whopping 20% of global terror funding.\n\nCalls for Donations since at Least 2019\n\nHamas affiliates, including its notorious military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, have been openly asking for Bitcoin Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that Read this Term donations since at least 2019. But, here's the kicker: these groups are not choosy. They've dabbled in various currencies, from dogecoin, which Elon Musk casually tweets about, to stablecoins like Tether and USDC, tied to the mighty US dollar. Amazingly, these calls were still happening even as the militants attacked. Israel Police's Lahav 433 cyber unit was working with Binance to lock down accounts linked to Hamas and to transfer the funds to the state. Since 2021, the authorities have confiscated 189 crypto accounts tied to Palestinian militant groups on Binance.\n\nIsrael Police Freeze #Crypto Accounts Held at #Binance Allegedly Used by Hamas https://t.co/fxxURZk5ul \u2014 Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) October 11, 2023\n\nIn a report from August 2023, Elliptic, a watchdog for crypto compliance, even mentioned that wallets it was keeping tabs on indicated that these terror groups were investing in DeFi protocols and making money using Solana, the crypto superstar backed by FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nHow Does This Happen?\n\nNow, you might wonder how these organizations manage to get their hands on crypto when they can't exactly stroll into the New York Stock Exchange. The answer? Smart contracts that conveniently sidestep those pesky \"know-your-customer\" (KYC) checks. According to Elliptic, some of these groups are even into crypto mining, which is essentially profiting from the nuts and bolts of cryptocurrency networks.\n\nTo counter this, Israeli and US officials have been trying to rope in crypto exchanges like Binance to block access for users tied to these groups. They're focusing their efforts on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body setting the rules to prevent money laundering. The FATF still lists dozens of countries on its \"grey list\", meaning they haven't met these standards. And, it includes names like Jordan, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates."

        "content": "A Bitcoin developer has proposed a new way to bring more expressive off-chain smart contracts to Bitcoin without needing a soft fork.\n\nAnnounced in an Oct. 9 white paper titled \u201cBitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin\u201d by ZeroSync project lead Robin Linus, BitVM enables Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts without altering Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules.\n\n\"Any computable function can be verified on Bitcoin\"https://t.co/Itf9UHos0C pic.twitter.com/CLQv49Ydsg \u2014 \u044fobin linus (@robin_linus) October 9, 2023\n\nA Turing-complete system is one that can theoretically provide an answer to any computational problem.\n\nWith BitVM, the \u201clogic\u201d of Bitcoin contracts would be executed off-chain, but verification would be made on Bitcoin \u2014 similar to Ethereum\u2019s optimistic rollups.\n\nBitVM\u2019s architecture is based on fraud proofs and a challenge-response model where a \u201cprover\u201d can make claims and a \u201cverifier\u201d can perform a fraud proof to punish the prover when false claims are made.\n\nLinus explained that Bitcoin, in its current form, is limited to basic operations, such as signatures, timelocks and hashlocks \u2014 but that can now be broadened with BitVM, which Linus says can compute a host of interesting applications.\n\n\u201cPotential applications include games like Chess, Go, or Poker, and particularly, verification of validity proofs in Bitcoin contracts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, it might be possible to bridge BTC to foreign chains, build a prediction market, or emulate novel opcodes,\u201d said Linus.\n\nLinus said a limitation of the model is that it is limited to a two-party setting with a prover and a verifier and that a significant amount of off-chain computation and communication is needed to execute programs.\n\nLinus said the next \u201cmilestone\u201d is to fully implement the BitVM in addition to Tree++, a high-level programming language to write and debug Bitcoin contracts.\n\nBitVM is enabled by the Taproot soft fork, which took place in November 2021.\n\nLinus cited Ethereum research into optimistic rollups and a study on Merkle trees in contributing to the eight-page white paper.\n\nBitcoiners respond to BitVM\n\nProminent Bitcoiner Eric Wall posted on X (Twitter) that the concepts outlined in the BitVM white paper \u201ccheck out\u201d and that he is \u201ccautiously excited\u201d to see what real-world experiments stem from it.\n\nBitcoin analyst Dylan LeClair is also impressed with BitVM\u2019s white paper. But Adam Back, a Bitcoin Core contributor, suggested that people shouldn\u2019t get too excited about the development just yet.\n\nfor people getting (over) excited, this is cool but effectively a generalization of a two-party game - it says right in the abstract - so it's a bit like Greg Maxwell's 2016 ZKP contingent payments implemented example https://t.co/OeHRsbFjud \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) October 9, 2023\n\nRelated: BIP-300 biff: Debate reignites over years-old Bitcoin Drivechain proposal\n\nOne builder in the blockchain space, \u201cdotta,\u201d noted that there is already a proof-of-concept on GitHub.\n\nAnother X user, Sam Parker, attempted to resolve a common fear among Bitcoin (BTC) maximalists by explaining that BitVM won\u2019t force Bitcoin\u2019s to be \u201clocked\u201d into these contracts.\n\n\u201cFinally, this is opt-in. If you don\u2019t trust your coins being locked to some Turing complete contract (totally reasonable) then don\u2019t lock them to a Turing complete smart contract. One of [the] beauties of the UTXO system is security sandboxing.\u201d\n\nOthers, such as \u201cPsage,\u201d say BitVM adds to the list of things that will push Bitcoin\u2019s price forward in the next bull market.\n\nThe bullish stuff around #Bitcoin is snowballing, lots of them controversial, nevertheless a few off my finger tips:\n\n- BitVM\n\n- Ordinals\n\n- Multiple Pres Candidates talking about it\n\n- ETF\n\n- Halving\n\n- Privacy improvements\n\n- Exponential Hash Rate increase\n\n- Countries mining\n\n.... \u2014 psage (@perspiringsage) October 9, 2023\n\nCointelegraph contacted Linus for comment but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nMagazine: Wolf Of All Streets worries about a world where Bitcoin hits $1M: Hall of Flame"

        "title": "'Did bitcoin leak from an American spy lab'? - The Times of India",
        "content": "What was the origin of Covid-19? The prevailing belief among most experts is that the virus made the leap from wild animals to humans, possibly at a meat market in Wuhan . However, an alternate theory suggests the virus might have accidentally escaped from a virology research lab in the same city. Even a US probe committee, formed by President Joe Biden , did not arrive at a definitive conclusion about the origins of the Covid-19?According to a report in the Economist, a similar debate is now emerging around Bitcoin, the first and most widely used cryptocurrency.Bitcoin's accepted genesis story involves an individual named Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous coder who described the cryptocurrency in a 2008 paper before disappearing from public view. However, an online theory suggests that Bitcoin might have been developed by the National Security Agency (NSA), an American intelligence agency known for its cryptography research. Some proponents of this theory point to a 1996 paper by NSA employees titled \"How to make a mint: the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash,\" which references work by a researcher named \"Tatsuaki Okamoto\", the Economist report said.Critics argue that this paper is not substantial evidence. It primarily surveys cryptographic concepts for digital cash, relying on a central authority, unlike Bitcoin, which is decentralized. The idea that the NSA would create a decentralized cryptocurrency that could disrupt its own government's functions seems implausible, according to skeptics like David Rosenthal.The only similarity between bitcoin and the NSA paper is that they both use some common cryptographic techniques, such as public-key encryption and digital signatures. But these techniques are widely known and used in many other applications, not just digital cash. They are not exclusive to the NSA or bitcoin.There is no reason to believe that bitcoin leaked from an American spy lab. It is more likely that Satoshi Nakamoto was an independent inventor who was influenced by various sources of cryptographic research, including the NSA paper, but also others.While this theory likely falls into the realm of conspiracy, a historical precedent exists. In 1997, it was revealed that Clifford Cocks, a mathematician at GCHQ, the British equivalent of the NSA, had secretly invented a crucial cryptographic technology foundational to both Bitcoin and the internet. This technology was developed years before a trio of American researchers received credit for it.A more fitting comparison between Bitcoin and Covid-19 might be their resilience, the Economist report says."

The first Salvadorian Bitcoin mining pool is named \u2018Lava Pool\u2019.The infrastructure will mine profitably in and out of El Salvador. The project\u2019s first phase involves the construction of a 241-megawatt (MW) renewable energy park in Metap\u00e1n, consisting of 169 MW of solar photovoltaic energy and 72 MW of wind energy. The project\u2019s long-term goal is to harness the abundant geothermal energy in the country.The pool is an outcome of a strategic collaboration between Volcano Energy, a renewable energy-focused Bitcoin mining company and Luxor Technologies, a Bitcoin mining tech company.Luxor, which operates one of the top ten Bitcoin mining pools, will offer Lava Pool participants Bitcoin hedging strategies to reduce losses due to market volatility. Luxor will receive a nominal fee from Lava Pool for its services.Luxor\u2019s Chief Operating Officer(COO), Ethan Vera, expressed his support for the mission, \u201cThe ethos of Bitcoin mining revolves around geographical decentralisation, and the development of mining pool infrastructure in El Salvador will contribute to this goal\u201d, he said. Volcano Energy\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer(CSO), Gerson Martinez, also shared his vision: \u201cOur vision is to create a vertically integrated energy and Bitcoin mining company whose value is accretive to investors and to all Salvadoran citizens. We are thrilled to launch Lava Pool in partnership with Luxor Technology, an industry leader in developing Bitcoin mining products and services for miners\u2014from plebs to nation states.\u201dAccording to a declaration by Volcano Energy, they plan to give 23% of their net income from mining operations to the El Salvador government. Some of the profits will be used to revitalise the country\u2019s current power transmission and distribution infrastructure.In 2021, El Salvador captivated the attention of the global crypto community by becoming the first country to recognise Bitcoin as a legal tender. As underlined by Martinez, \u201cLava Pool is another example of El Salvador\u2019s first mover advantage as a nation-state in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\u201dWith the launch of its first Bitcoin mining pool, El Salvador now leads the way in harnessing the potential of Bitcoin mining and renewable energy. This presents an opportunity for other countries with ample renewable energy sources to use Bitcoin mining to improve the economics of their new energy projects."

        "content": "In a recent interview with CNBC, billionaire hedge fund manager and legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones expounded on his bullish stance on Bitcoin amidst mounting global tensions and economic uncertainties.\n\nJones, an influential figure in the investment world, highlighted the current geopolitical environment as one of the most \u201cthreatening and challenging\u201d he has ever witnessed and emphasized the importance of diversifying investment portfolios with assets like Bitcoin and gold.\n\nJones told CNBC, \u201cI love gold and bitcoin together. I think they probably take on a larger percentage of your portfolio than they would [historically] because we\u2019re going to go through both a challenging political time here in the United States and we\u2019ve obviously got a geopolitical situation.\u201d\n\nNow Is The Time To Buy Bitcoin And Gold\n\nRecent global events have exacerbated these sentiments. Over the weekend, the Israeli government launched a military response against Hamas following an attack on Israel, escalating tensions in an already fragile Middle Eastern region. Additionally, Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine and growing discord between China and the US have further rattled global markets and economies.\n\nIn the same breath, Jones remarked on the US\u2019s alarming fiscal position, stating it\u2019s \u201cprobably in its weakest fiscal position since World War II.\u201d\n\nResponding to concerns about the potential impact of high interest rates on Bitcoin, Jones delved deeper into the dynamics of gold and market trades preceding a recession. He stipulated, \u201cI think on a relative basis what\u2019s happened to gold, it has been clearly suppressed. But you know that more likely or not we are going into a recession.\u201d\n\nJones underscored a few hallmarks of recessionary trading environments, indicating, \u201cThere are some pretty clear recession trades. The easiest are: the yield curve gets very steep, home premium goes into the backend of the debt market and the 10-year, 30-year, 7-year paper, the stock market typically right before recession declines about 12%.\u201d This decline, according to Jones, is not just plausible but likely to transpire at a certain juncture.\n\nAdditionally, he emphasized the prospective bullish market for assets like Bitcoin and gold during economic downturns, stating, \u201cAnd when you look at the big shorts in gold, more likely or not in a recession, the market is typically very long; assets like Bitcoin and gold.\u201d\n\nJones further prognosticated a substantial influx into the gold market, speculating, \u201cSo there\u2019s probably $40 billion worth of buying coming in gold at some point before now and when that recession actually occurs.\u201d Expressing his asset preference amidst the aforementioned conditions, Jones concisely noted, \u201cSo, I like Bitcoin and I like gold right now.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019s endorsement of Bitcoin isn\u2019t new as the investor had previously championed the digital currency in several interviews, citing its potential as a hedge against inflation and lauding its immutable mathematical properties.\n\nHe once remarked, \u201cBitcoin is math, and math has been around for thousands of years.\u201d By mid-2021, Jones even increased his Bitcoin allocation from 1-2%, labeling it as a \u201cbet on certainty amid uncertain economic conditions.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019s remarks came at a time when the cryptocurrency saw an approximate 63% increase year to date, making it the best-performing asset in 2023.\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin was trading at $27,116, down roughly 2% over the past 24 hours. Amidst the recent price drop, BTC initially found support at the 200-day EMA (blue line), which the bulls should hold at all costs to avoid further downward momentum.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Halving 2024: how it will affect Bitcoin - Bit2Me",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies has always been full of unique terms and events, and one of the most important is the Bitcoin halving. This event occurs approximately every four years and has a significant impact on the world's most famous cryptocurrency. In this article, we will explore in detail what is bitcoin halving, how bitcoin halving works and what implications it could have for investors and the crypto industry in general.\n\n\u00bfWhat is Bitcoin halving?? The Bitcoin halving is a scheduled event within the cryptocurrency protocol that halves the reward miners receive for validating blocks on the blockchain. In simpler terms, you could say that it is a halving in the amount of Bitcoin that is created and put into circulation with each new block created. The main goal of the halving is to control Bitcoin inflation and ensure that the supply of the cryptocurrency is limited. The Bitcoin halving process is based on a predefined and automatic algorithm. Every 210.000 blocks mined, approximately every four years, the reward miners receive is halved. Initially, when Bitcoin was launched in 2009, the reward was 50 BTC per block. With this mechanism in place, the first halving in 2012 reduced the reward to 25 BTC per block, and then to 12,5 BTC in the second halving in 2016. With the third halving in 2020, the reward was reduced to 6,25 BTC and finally with the fourth halving which will take place in 2024, the Bitcoin reward will drop to 3,125 BTC. This cycle will continue to be fulfilled as long as Bitcoin and its network continue to function, until the last cycle is fulfilled, in the year 2144. All of this following the economic plan of the network: issue a maximum of close to 21 million coins and drive the revaluation of BTC as its adoption and economic plan progress.\n\nImpact of Bitcoin halving and the industry Now, the impact of this new Bitcoin halving on the crypto industry and on cryptocurrency is enormous. Thus, we can measure this impact in the following fundamental spaces:\n\nMining, scarcity and demand Bitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are created and transactions are validated on the network. Miners use their computing equipment to solve complex mathematical problems that verify and secure Bitcoin transactions. In exchange for their work, miners are rewarded with newly generated bitcoins. The Bitcoin halving has a direct impact on cryptocurrency mining. And every 210.000 blocks mined (approx. 4 years), the reward miners receive per block is reduced by half. At the time of writing, the current block reward is 6,25 bitcoins, but after the 2024 halving, this will drop to 3,125 bitcoins. This reduction in reward has several implications. First of all, reduces the number of bitcoins entering circulation, contributing to the cryptocurrency's scarcity. This can have a positive impact on the price of Bitcoin in the long term, as the limited supply can increase its value. In second place, Halving affects the profitability of mining. When the reward is halved, miners receive fewer bitcoins for their work. This may make mining less profitable for some miners, especially those with higher electricity and equipment costs. Some miners may be forced to shut down their operations if they cannot cover their expenses. However, Halving can also have a positive effect on long-term mining profitability. If the price of Bitcoin rises enough, the reduction in the block reward can be offset by the additional value of the mined bitcoins. Additionally, halving can increase demand for mining equipment, which can benefit manufacturers and related service providers. In summary, the Bitcoin halving has a significant impact in cryptocurrency mining. It reduces the block reward, which can affect the profitability of miners and the supply of bitcoins in circulation. However, it can also contribute to scarcity and increase the value of Bitcoin in the long term. Besides, Bitcoin halving has its own phases and it is important for miners to understand these changes and adjust their strategies accordingly.\n\nVolatility La bitcoin volatility It is closely related to the halving due to several factors. First, the reduction in the amount of Bitcoin created and circulated may create scarcity in the market. As a result, demand for Bitcoin may increase, which may lead to an increase in the price of Bitcoin. However, this growth in demand can also lead to greater volatility, as investors and traders react to changes in price. Furthermore, halving also has an impact on the profitability of the company. bitcoin mining. With the reward for miners decreasing, some may choose to exit the market if profitability decreases. This can affect the hash rate of the Bitcoin network and, in turn, the stability and volatility of Bitcoin. It is important to note that volatility is not necessarily negative. For some traders, volatility can present significant profit opportunities, especially those who trade Bitcoin options. However, it is also important to consider the risks associated with the volatility and speculative nature of Bitcoin. In summary, the Bitcoin halving Volatility may increase due to shortages and increased demand, as well as changes in mining profitability. Traders can use Bitcoin options to capitalize on this volatility, but it is essential to understand the risks and have a good knowledge of how Bitcoin options work.\n\nAdoption and awareness The Bitcoin halving also generates a increased interest and awareness around cryptocurrency. The media often covers this event, which can attract new investors and increase overall Bitcoin adoption. As more people become familiar with the halving, we may see an increase in the number of people interested in learning about Bitcoin and participating in its market."

        "content": "At a time when Bitcoin price has shown a significant recovery this year till date after the bloodbath of 2022, crypto billionaire Changpeng Zhao, who is the CEO world's largest crypto exchange Binance, has made a bold prediction.\n\nWhat Has Binance CEO Predicted?\n\nreuters\n\nThe Binance CEO has expressed his belief that the next Bitcoin halving process, scheduled for 2024, could usher in a period of renewed price growth, and even push Bitcoin price to an all-time high.\n\n\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Halving?\n\nBitcoin halving is when the reward for Bitcoin mining is cut in half. The halving policy was written into Bitcoin\u2019s mining algorithm to counteract inflation by maintaining scarcity. In theory, the reduction in the pace of Bitcoin issuance means that the price will increase if demand remains the same. Halving takes place every four years.\n\nAlso Read: Goldman Sachs Lends Its First Bitcoin-Backed Loan\n\nHow Is Bitcoin Halving Done?\n\ngetty\n\nFirstly, a decentralized network of validators verifies all Bitcoin transactions in a process called mining. They are paid 6.25 BTC when they are the first to use complex math to add a group of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain as part of its proof-of-work mechanism. Those blocks of transactions are added roughly every 10 minutes, and the Bitcoin code dictates that the reward for miners is reduced by half after every 210,000 blocks are created. That happens roughly every four years in periods that are often accompanied by heightened Bitcoin price volatility.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: US Man Pays 10,000 Bitcoins For Pizza\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Halving Impact The Price?\n\ngetty\n\nBitcoin Halvings, which occur approximately every four years, are pivotal events in the cryptocurrency's history. During these events, the rate at which new Bitcoin is created through mining is reduced, resulting in a reduction in the asset's issuance.\n\n\n\nAs alluded to by Zhao, this supply shock has historically had a significant impact on the price of Bitcoin, resulting in all-time highs in 2013, 2017, and 2021. For the unversed, the first Bitcoin halving occurred in November 2012. The next halving was in July 2016, and the most recent halving was in May 2020.\n\nSo, in all of the last four bitcoin halvings, the crypto token's price did reach an all-time high in the following year. As per this trend, bitcoin prices will hit a new all-time high by 2025.\n\nCurrently, bitcoin price is $27,528.80.\n\nBillionaire Zhao's remarks on the potential for \"all-time highs\" following the 2024 Bitcoin halving are grounded in historical trends. Over the past three halvings, Bitcoin has experienced remarkable price surges in the years that followed, as per NASDAQ.\n\nBinance CEO Zhao offers the following explanation for the data:\n\nPre-Halving Excitement: In the lead-up to a Bitcoin halving, the cryptocurrency community typically witnesses a surge in excitement, discussions, and media coverage. This phenomenon reflects the anticipation and high expectations surrounding the event.\n\n\n\nPost-Halving Reality: Contrary to some expectations, the price of Bitcoin does not immediately double overnight following a halving. Instead, the immediate aftermath is often characterized by a period of consolidation and adjustments.\n\n\n\nSubsequent Price Surges: It is in the year or years following a Bitcoin halving that the cryptocurrency's price has historically surged to new all-time highs. This phenomenon is driven by a combination of factors, including increased awareness, growing adoption, and the reduced rate of Bitcoin production.\n\nAs such, the remarks find Zhao echoing the belief of many Bitcoiners that the asset is becoming predictable and cyclical with its price movements, as a result of the fact that it is sound money whose monetary policy isn't controlled by governments. These events serve as a reminder of the digital currency's deflationary characteristics, setting it apart from traditional fiat currencies.\n\nNow it remains to be seen whether 2024's bitcoin halving indeed ends up shooting up bitcoin's price or not. We'll have to wait and watch!\n\nAlso Read: World's First Ever Bitcoin Tower Set To Be Built In Dubai\n\nFor the latest and more interesting financial news, keep reading Indiatimes Worth.

        "title": "Bitcoin and potential integration into GTA 6's crypto gaming economy - Hindustan Times",
        "content": "There is a lot of buzz in the gaming and crypto communities about the possibility of Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) integrating cryptocurrencies into its gameplay. GTA 6 x Bitcoin Spark?\n\nThis feature would allow players to earn, spend, or trade digital currencies within the virtual world of GTA 6, adding a new layer of realism and immersion. But, Rockstar Games has not confirmed or denied these rumours, leaving fans to speculate and imagine how crypto gaming would work.\n\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\n\nCrypto gaming is not a new concept\n\nCrypto gaming has been around for a while, with games like Axie Infinity and Decentraland leading the way. These games use Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as digital assets that players can collect, trade, or sell for real-world value. NFTs are unique and scarce tokens that represent ownership of digital items, such as art, music, or game characters.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Spark?\n\nOne of the cryptocurrencies that could benefit from crypto gaming is Bitcoin Spark (BTCS). Bitcoin Spark is a fork of Bitcoin that uses a novel 'Proof of Process' consensus mechanism. This mechanism aims to create a more fair and decentralized network, where rewards are distributed based on the quality and quantity of work done by the nodes. Bitcoin Spark also claims to have faster transactions, lower fees, and higher scalability than Bitcoin.\n\nALSO READ| Fans are mocking GTA 6 \u2018announcement\u2019 leaker, sending death threats\n\nBitcoin Spark\u2019s vision of fairness and decentralization aligns well with the gaming industry\u2019s goals of creating inclusive and engaging in-game economies. If Bitcoin Spark is integrated into GTA 6 or other crypto games, it could offer players a new way to participate in the game world and benefit from their gaming activities.\n\nIs Crypto gaming risky?\n\nCrypto gaming is not without risks. The crypto market is volatile and unpredictable, with regulatory uncertainties and potential security breaches. Moreover, crypto gaming could face game-specific challenges, such as balancing the gameplay, preventing cheating, and protecting user privacy.\n\nThe rumours about GTA 6 and cryptocurrencies have sparked a lot of interest and curiosity among gamers and crypto enthusiasts. As for Bitcoin Spark, its unique features could make it a suitable candidate for crypto gaming integration. The future of crypto gaming is full of possibilities."

        "title": "Digital Asset Recap Q3 2023: Bitcoin and Ether Outperform Wider Market Amid Regulatory Pressure and the Promise ... - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Over the past quarter, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which spans over 90% of the crypto market capitalization, declined -11%. Bitcoin (BTC) outperformed the broad benchmark by declining -10.9% while ether (ETH) underperformed, posting a loss of -12.5% for the last 3 months.\n\nIt's helpful to view these numbers in the context of their year-to-date performance, where Bitcoin has gained an impressive 64%, and Ether has risen by 41%. This underscores the resilience of these cryptocurrencies as some of the top-performing assets in 2023. This quarterly outperformance of BTC versus ETH and the broader CMI is a continuation of a trend we\u2019ve seen throughout the year. Institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs continues to support BTC, while the continued regulatory pressure on alternative tokens drives the bifurcation in the crypto market between the established majors (Bitcoin and Ether) and other digital asset protocols and projects.\n\nSector-by-sector\n\nLooking within sector quarterly performance with the CoinDesk DACS framework, the trends and preferences towards larger capitalization tokens are less clear. Over Q3 of 2023, Computing (CPU, +3%) and DeFi sectors (DCF, -8%) were relative out-performers, while Smart Contract Platform (SMT, -13%), which contains Ether, and Culture and Entertainment (CNE, -22%) were relative under-performers. See the chart below for a full sector performance breakdown for Q3 of 2023.\n\nDACS Q3 2023 Performance (CDI Research)\n\nNews related to U.S. regulation was a key driver of price movements this quarter, with SEC actions featuring prominently in this. This followed regulatory enforcement action against Coinbase and Binance earlier in June. Meanwhile, regulatory filings for spot ETFs by some of the world's largest asset managers introduced a lot of price action ahead of potential approval dates.\n\nWhile July and August were relatively muted months for the market, September saw the outperformance of DeFi, Digitization and the Computing sector off the back of the partial Ripple court case win earlier in the month, and investor enthusiasm for AI, which propelled Chainlink (LINK), an on-chain data provider and the largest token of the Computing sector, to rise 24% for the month.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeptember also marked the one-year anniversary of Ethereum\u2019s successful transition to a \u201cProof-of-Stake\u201d consensus mechanism. This reduces the amount of computational work needed to verify blocks and transactions, effectively eliminating its carbon footprint. So far, the network has been operating as intended with staking assets becoming a popular way for crypto investors to enhance returns. CoinDesk Indices Composite Ether Staking Rate (CESR), a metric used to proxy the expected income from Ethereum staking activities, averaged 4% (annualized) over the quarterly period, trending lower to end September at 3.6%.\n\nOne significant shift in the cryptocurrency landscape in this quarter is the reduced level of risk, as defined by standard risk measures. We are now seeing lower levels of volatility, decreased correlation with traditional equities, and slightly reduced correlation among the top-30 tokens, as shown below.\n\nRolling Sector Correlations and Volatility (CDI Research)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shift could be an indication of a maturation of the market, as investors are becoming more discerning across token sectors, or it could be an artifact of market illiquidity, as trading volumes continue to decrease across large cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nWhere next?\n\nBond yields are rising sharply off of a relatively hawkish September FOMC, where the summary of economic projections (i.e. \u201cthe dot plot\u201d) eliminated the expectation for interest rate cuts in the near term. This dot plot guidance allowed the Federal Reserve to be clearer and more concise in indicating to the market that interest rates would have to be held higher for longer. While rising interest rates haven\u2019t immediately impacted the price of digital assets, the tightening of financial conditions and strengthening of the U.S. dollar should be expected to add further headwinds to the price appreciation for crypto currencies. Coincidentally, the CoinDesk Bitcoin and Ether Trend Indicators have registered neutral to slightly negative trend signals over the first few days of Q4.\n\nA catalyst to break through the macroeconomic headwinds of tightening financial conditions could come in the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nWhy?\n\nFirstly, it would greatly enhance accessibility, allowing a broader range of investors to easily gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct purchase and storage, like how gold ETFs, starting in the early-2000s, simplified the process of gaining exposure to physical gold. This in turn could shift and diversify the investor base in cryptocurrencies, from tech-savvy enthusiasts to more mainstream, longer-term investors seeking diversification, which could result in a reduction in volatility across the digital asset market.\n\nAdditionally, the ETF structure would facilitate easier institutional adoption, delegating asset acquisition and storage to qualified custodians, making it more familiar and regulated for institutional investors like hedge funds and pension funds.\n\nFinally, a Bitcoin ETF will allow investors to allocate a portion of their assets to Bitcoin as a store of value or an uncorrelated asset class. This could result in a significant influx of capital into the cryptocurrency market, marking the maturation of Bitcoin from a niche asset class to a regulated and accepted part of the traditional financial system."
