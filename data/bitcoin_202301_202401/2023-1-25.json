        "content": "\"Impact x Nightline\" takes a look at the victims of the financial collapse.\n\nThe year crypto broke: How customers, investors lost millions and what's being done\n\nIt seemed like cryptocurrency was having a moment.\n\nAt the start of 2022, the Super Bowl featured celebrities like Tom Brady, Larry David and Matt Damon in commercials for crypto companies. Logos for crypto companies like FTX could be seen plastered on multiple sports arenas and a new wave of crypto influencers emerged, garnering hundreds of thousands of followers. Cryptocurrency was everywhere.\n\nIt was supposed to be an alternative to traditional finance.\n\nInstead of exchanging money through a third party, like a bank, cryptocurrency allows users to transfer digital currency directly. However, unlike traditional forms of currency such as the U.S. dollar, the government does not insure deposits and federal agencies have taken limited steps to regulate the crypto industry.\n\nBut the major crash of the crypto market last year has brought headaches, fear and anger among the millions of people around the world who invested their savings and are left wondering whether they'll ever see their money again.\n\nCurt Dell, a father of three from California, told ABC News' Rebecca Jarvis that he's lost over $200,000 in Bitcoin after the digital crypto lending company Celsius went bankrupt last year.\n\n\"It robbed [my family] of so much potential,\" said Dell, a California resident who works in sales. \"It's such a bad situation.\"\n\nCurt Dell said he lost more than $200,000 worth of Bitcoin after Celsius filed for bankruptcy. ABC News\n\n\"Impact x Nightline\" takes a closer look at the chaos throughout the industry, speaking with executives at some of the biggest crypto companies, top officials at regulatory agencies, and the regular customers who suffered from the collapse. This episode is streaming now on Hulu.\n\n\"Crypto kind of rose out of the 2008 financial crisis,\" David Yaffe-Bellany, a New York Times reporter who covers crypto, told \"Impact.\"\n\n\"That whole catastrophe was an example of the failures of the centralized financial system, and it helped inspire this movement to create a parallel financial system that didn't rely on the types of institutions whose bad behavior had caused a lot of people to suffer.\"\n\nThe crash shook the entire industry - and multiple companies, including Celsius Network, filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\"What the crash did was prompt a kind of run on the bank. People panicked,\" Yaffe-Bellany said. \"They thought that their cryptocurrencies were in danger, and they moved to withdraw everything that they deposited in Celsius, and that's what kind of exposed the kind of shaky foundations of the whole company.\"\n\nAlex Mashinsky, Founder and CEO at Celsius, speaks at the Web Summit 2021 in Lisbon, Portugal. LightRocket via Getty Images, FILE\n\nCelsius was founded by Alex Mashinsky and two partners in 2017. Mashinsky used social media to promote his company and its high-yield crypto earnings.\n\n\"The whole idea of Celsius network was that it was a kind of crypto bank, except better than a bank,\" Yaffe-Bellany said. \u201cYou'd deposit your crypto. It would be safe there, but you'd also get these enormous returns on top of that.\u201d\n\nAt its peak, Celsius had 2 million customers and a $3 million valuation. The company filed for bankruptcy in July.\n\nIn early January, New York Attorney General Letitia James sued Mashinsky, accusing him of defrauding investors. He didn't respond to multiple requests by ABC News for an interview or comment.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to know how the Celsius bankruptcy process will play out, and whether customers will get back any of their money.\n\n\"I'd like to stay optimistic and think that I'll get at least a significant portion of it back,\" Dell said of his investment. \"I don't think anybody really knows.\"\n\nCelsius' bankruptcy has also been intertwined with the biggest scandal rocking the crypto industry: the fall of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX.\n\nFormer FTX Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried departs Manhattan federal court in New York City, after a hearing, Jan. 3, 2023. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder and CEO of FTX, posted on social media suggesting he might bid to take over Celsius\u2019 assets shortly after the company filed for bankruptcy.\n\nBut that was before FTX found itself in trouble as well.\n\nIn early November, FTX filed for bankruptcy after a series of events exposed a multi-billion-dollar hole in the company\u2019s balance sheet. A little over a month later Bankman-Fried was charged in federal court with eight counts of fraud. He has pleaded not guilty and his trial is slated to begin in October.\n\nThe series of high-profile collapses in the crypto industry has prompted calls for more regulation from the federal government.\n\nFormer FTX Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried passes through security on the day of a hearing at Manhattan federal court in New York City, Jan. 3, 2023. Andrew Kelly/Reuters, FILE\n\nThe high-profile crypto collapses have prompted calls from activists, elected officials and others for more regulation from the federal government.\n\nChristy Goldsmith Romero, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told \"Impact\" that she agrees that the industry does need more oversight.\n\n\"We need, as regulators, the ability to go in to inspect, to go in and have exams, to set rules. And we need to ensure that there's no commingling of assets,\" she said.\n\nChristy Goldsmith Romero, a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, talks to ABC News about the ongoing problems of cryptocurrencies. ABC News\n\nGary Gensler, the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, told \"Impact\" he is willing to work more with the CFTC to protect consumers from shady crypto investments. In the meantime, he warned consumers to think hard before they invest their money in crypto.\n\n\"Don't get caught up in the FOMO, but you're also at risk of a field that the business model is taking your assets [and] co-mingling them, often in ways that are not allowed by our current laws,\" he said."

        "content": "The last year has been unkind to bitcoin, with its price dropping nearly 60% from its peak. That's dampened a lot of the hype around bitcoin, but not all of it. There are still many believers in the cryptocurrency's future, with Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers among them.\n\nRogers, a pro-Donald Trump Republican elected to Arizona's senate in 2020, on Tuesday submitted a bill that would make bitcoin legal tender in the state. Following in the footsteps of El Salvador, whose polarizing president made bitcoin legal tender in 2021, the bill, if passed, would afford bitcoin the same legal status as the US dollar. It could be used to pay debts, taxes and as a commercial medium of exchange.\n\nThe bills are co-sponsored by Rogers' state senate Repubican colleagues Jeff Weninger and J.D. Mesnard. Barring support from state Democrats, the bills could pass with uniform backing from the state's Republican senators and representatives. Republicans hold 16 of Arizona's 30 state senate seats and 31 of its 60 House of Representative spots.\n\nA similar bill introduced by Rogers in 2022 was quickly shot down, however. Rogers has also proposed allowing voters in 2024 decide whether cryptocurrency should be tax exempt in the state.\n\n\"Centralized digital money controlled by the central bankers is slavery,\" Rogers tweeted in April, hearkening back to bitcoin's Libertarian roots. \"Decentralized Bitcoin is freedom.\"\n\nMost famous for its adoption of bitcoin as legal tender is El Salvador. Led by President Nayib Bukele, the country has spent an estimated $107 million buying bitcoin, with those holdings now worth about half that amount. The beleaguered country's government spent another estimated $268 million setting up digital infrastructure for bitcoin, including a $30 incentive for everyone who signed up for its official bitcoin wallet, Chivo.\n\nCritics say the adoption of bitcoin was a cost that the heavily indebted country couldn't afford. Proponents say bitcoin is a more efficient means for remittances and that the country's sharp post-COVID tourism recovery can be chalked up at least partially to crypto tourism.\n\nArizona isn't alone in grappling with the regulation of cryptocurrency. Last week, lawmakers in Missouri and Mississippi sought to craft law protecting citizens' rights to mine bitcoin, an electricity-guzzling process that was banned in New York last year."

        "content": "A new nuclear-powered data center in Pennsylvania will host bitcoin mining.\n\nThis is the first nuclear-powered bitcoin mine in the United States.\n\nBitcoin mining is a historically pollution-filled industry, but it\u2019s beginning to focus on cleaner energy to run energy-hungry computers.\n\nComputers eat up a lot of energy, and so do the blockchains required to constantly mine cryptocurrency. But a new nuclear-powered data center is set to launch in Pennsylvania later this year, and it could shift at least some of that pollution-filled energy consumption to a cleaner version.\n\nCumulus Data has wrapped the first phase of its 475-megawatt, zero-carbon Susquehanna data center campus in northeast Pennsylvania. The project starts with a 48-megawatt, 300,000-square-foot data center to power TeraWulf, a bitcoin mining company.\n\nThe 1,200-acre campus aims to provide zero-carbon energy from Talen Energy\u2019s Susquehanna nuclear power generation facility. The Cumulus data centers will connect directly to the facility without legacy electric transmission and distribution utilities. The data centers employing direct-connect, on-site nuclear power generation will make it the first nuclear-powered bitcoin mine in the U.S.\n\nRelated Story Bitcoin Uses More Electricity Than Argentina\n\nTo mine additional bitcoin, computers must continually operate to solve complex puzzles. This process is a power-sucking endeavor that has led to massive data centers across the world dedicated just to bitcoin mining. These data centers crave energy. Ethereum, the world\u2019s second largest crypto blockchain, has already started improving its carbon emission efforts, but bitcoin accounts for roughly 70 percent of all crypto electricity usage and hasn\u2019t made major gains in cleaning up its process.\n\nElectricity usage from global crypto mining quadrupled from 2018 to 2022, according to the U.S. government. By mid-2022, crypto assets were using upward of 240 billion kilowatt hours per year\u2014more than the annual electricity of countries such as Argentina or Australia. Crypto electricity usage made up nearly 1 percent of all annual global electricity usage, and crypto operations consume up to 1.7 percent of all U.S. electricity usage.\n\nAs data centers across the world look to move cryptocurrency mining toward renewable energy, switching to nuclear may serve as one way to clean up the industry."

        "title": "Going Nuclear: Bitcoin Mining's Potential Energy Future - Blockworks",
        "content": "Though the prevalence of bitcoin miners using nuclear energy at scale could take years to materialize, several players in the space are bullish on the prospect.\n\nVolatility around bitcoin and the general slow pace of movement in an often risk-averse power industry could serve as barriers though, industry participants said.\n\nBitcoin miner TeraWulf recently revealed it is setting up operations at a nuclear energy-powered data center in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, as part of a partnership with Talen Energy forged in 2021.\n\nThe company is targeting 50 megawatts (MW) of mining capacity at the site, with a hashrate capacity of about 1.6 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nTeraWulf began operations at its other site in upstate New York last March, using hydro and solar power at the facility. It is now set to commence mining at the nuclear plant by the end of the quarter.\n\nNuclear, natural gas and coal provide base load \u2014 a minimum level of power on a grid over a period of time. Renewable energy, such wind and solar sources, have intermittent load, meaning they are not continuous.\n\n\u201cGiven the significant penetration of renewables, what\u2019s been happening with a lot of these base-load facilities is they\u2019re not running at base load anymore,\u201d Nazar Khan, TeraWulf\u2019s co-founder and chief operating officer, told Blockworks. \u201cThey were looking and saying the optimal way to run a nuclear facility is for it to just run.\u201d\n\nKhan added that the set-up allows for a bitcoin miner to be an asset to a system that rarely uses peak demand. While TeraWulf gets a reliable and carbon-free energy source to mine bitcoin, the nuclear plant can guarantee a number of megawatts coming off their generators each day.\n\n\u201cIf we could do five more deals like Talen, we would,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had discussions with the largest nuclear operators in the country down to folks who have a couple of sites.\u201d\n\nKhan said the conversations are ongoing, declining to share the specific nuclear operators TeraWulf is in talks with.\n\nHow do other miners view nuclear energy sources?\n\nTeraWulf is not the only miner bullish on using nuclear power.\n\nWhile Marathon Digital has not yet made nuclear power a major part of its strategy, it sees the energy source as a potential key part of the future. The company doubled its hashrate in 2022 to 7 EH/s and expects to have 23 EH/s of capacity installed near the middle of 2023.\n\n\u201cWhen we, and I think a lot of other bitcoin miners, realized how much stranded or wasted wind and solar [energy] there was\u2026that became a pretty good target for bitcoin miners,\u201d said Charlie Schumacher, Marathon\u2019s vice president of corporate communications. \u201cBecause you\u2019re looking for stranded, wasted energy; you don\u2019t want to compete with consumers for electricity.\n\n\u201cSo I think that was low-hanging fruit initially, but long-term nuclear makes a ton of sense,\u201d he told Blockworks.\n\nUK-based Lake Parime, a company focused on transforming energy into zero-carbon computing power, revealed in November that it launched a site in Ohio using 100% nuclear energy.\n\nThe 20 megawatt (MW) site\u2019s hosting clients are Marathon and TAAL, a company that offers blockchain services and infrastructure.\n\nSchumacher said the Ohio site is a good way for Marathon to \u201ctest the waters\u201d about potentially using nuclear energy on a larger scale.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely interested if we can find a site that works for us,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you just think of the nuclear sites that exist today, we would be happy to co-locate next to one and serve as a base-load customer for them.\u201d\n\nLili Rhodes, a senior mining analyst at Compass Mining, called nuclear power an ideal power source for bitcoin miners in a September 2021 blog post \u2014 noting that it is energy efficient and cheap.\n\nWilliam Foxley, Compass Mining\u2019s director of media and strategy, told Blockworks that Compass Mining has a few mines connected to larger grids partially run on nuclear energy.\n\nThe company secured a 20-year partnership with Oklo, a fission company that had a proposed power plant being reviewed by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. But Foxley said Compass Mining\u2019s deal with Oklo is on pause until its partner receives more regulatory clarity.\n\nThe current power strategy of Riot Blockchain, meanwhile, focuses on having a large, flexible load in Texas\u2019s ERCOT grid, according to CEO Jason Les. This includes various emission-free energy sources, including wind, solar and nuclear.\n\nLes did not return a request for further comment.\n\nHive Blockchain, another publicly traded miner, does not use nuclear energy, CEO Aydin Kilic said.\n\n\u201cOur focus has been hydro and geothermal, which do not produce waste,\u201d he told Blockworks. \u201cNuclear is treated as non-emitting but it is not a renewable green energy source like hydro and geothermal.\u201d\n\nBarriers to overcome\n\nSchumacher called the nuclear energy industry an \u201cintensely regulated space\u201d with few new sites.\n\nRhodes wrote in the 2021 blog post that nuclear power is demonized by the mainstream media and feared by the general public. Many people associate the word nuclear with bomb, Schumacher added, further slowing the pace of adoption.\n\nThe newest reactor to enter service is Tennessee\u2019s Watts Bar Unit 2, which began operation in 2016, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). The next-youngest operating reactor is Watts Bar Unit 1, also in Tennessee, which opened in 1996.\n\nOverall, there were 92 nuclear reactors operating at 54 nuclear power plants in 28 states, as of July 2022, EIA data shows. Nuclear power plants have supplied about 20% of total annual electricity used in the US since 1990.\n\nWhile nuclear energy is a great source of power for bitcoin miners in theory, Schumacher said, it takes two sides to form a partnership.\n\n\u201cI think like many folks in the power industry, they\u2019re risk-averse,\u201d he added. \u201cThey think in terms of decades and bitcoin thinks in terms of months or days sometimes.\u201d\n\nJonathan Cobb, senior communication manager at the World Nuclear Association, told Blockworks that bitcoin\u2019s volatility in recent months could pose an issue.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price is down 66% from its all-time high reached in November 2021, and various miners have struggled to pay back debt it took on to expand during the bull run. Compute North and Core Scientific have filed for bankruptcy in recent months, and industry watchers have said they expect more casualties in the space this year.\n\n\u201cWill bitcoin miners be in a position to agree to supply contracts that would be mutually beneficial?\u201d Cobb said. \u201cThis would be less of an issue for other types of data centers with more certain business models.\u201d\n\nKhan said the drastic fluctuating margins of the bitcoin mining industry through market cycles has turned off some nuclear power executives. Others in the power industry aren\u2019t sold on bitcoin as an asset more generally, he added.\n\nStill, Khan said he believes as the bitcoin mining space consolidates and matures, it has a place in the nuclear energy segment.\n\n\u201cWe would love for it to be the majority,\u201d he said of nuclear energy as a power source for TeraWulf long term. \u201cIt\u2019s a zero-carbon base-load resource, so in terms of how it fits into what we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s a wonderful resource to have.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Can bitcoin be used for cross-border payments? - Kraken Blog",
        "content": "In 2008, an anonymous researcher (or team of researchers) called Satoshi Nakamoto published a nine-page research paper entitled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\u201d The document, known as the Bitcoin white paper, presented a new type of digital currency that users could use to transact without relying on financial intermediaries.\n\nSoon, people around the world discovered that blockchain transactions, specifically cross-border transactions, were faster than most international bank transfers. The blockchain could settle a bitcoin transaction in just a few minutes as compared to the 2-3 business days needed by traditional services. By removing banks from the process, Bitcoin mitigated the high costs often associated with cross-border payments.\n\nHow bitcoin payments work\n\nBitcoin network and blockchain\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the protocol\u2019s native digital currency, circumvents the banking system by relying on a series of interconnected \u201cnodes.\u201d\n\nVolunteer users operate these nodes on the Bitcoin network and help maintain it by using their computers to perform various tasks. These machines are connected to the Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 a special type of ledger system used to verify and record transaction data.\n\nYou can think of these two concepts \u2013 the Bitcoin network and blockchain \u2013 as a globally distributed group of people all working together on an open Google Document. Whenever new information is added to the document, everyone else has to first make sure there are no errors in it. The document is also totally accessible to anyone who wishes to view it \u2013 not just those working on it.\n\nIn exchange for fulfilling energy-intensive roles like data validation, nodes can earn rewards paid in newly minted bitcoin.\n\nHow a transaction works\n\nWhen a person wishes to send a bitcoin transaction to someone, they first have to broadcast it to the rest of the network. Nodes then independently check the validity of the transaction and compete to win the right to add that and a batch of other transactions into a new block on the blockchain.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain, you can check out our Learn Center guide What is bitcoin mining?\n\nOnce we add a transaction to the blockchain, it\u2019s finalized. Because there are no intermediaries involved, it doesn\u2019t matter whether the recipient is in the same country or on the other side of the world. In theory, all transactions take the same amount of time to process. You can think of it as sending an email versus a hand-written letter.\n\nThese properties are why cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are ideal for frictionless remittances and cross-border transfers.\n\nBarriers to bitcoin payments adoption\n\nThere are several advantages to using bitcoin over traditional currencies. A 2021 survey found that only 13% of U.S. customers preferred to use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies when sending overseas payments. This low level of preference occurs despite figures showing that 42% of surveyed people paid an average fee of 6.2% when sending traditional remittance payments.\n\nSo what\u2019s holding people back? It is possible people are put off by several misconceptions surrounding bitcoin payments.\n\nPrivacy\n\nBitcoin transactions aren\u2019t usually anonymous. When you use an exchange to transfer cryptocurrency, you must submit something called Know Your Customer (KYC) data. This data often includes your personal information and a copy of your passport. KYC is important because it makes sure that transactions are legal and regulated.\n\nIllicit activities\n\nFor many years, criminals have abused the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin payments to fund nefarious activities. While it\u2019s impossible to know exactly what percentage of payments are involved in illegal ventures, advancements in detection, tracking, and enforcement have made fraud far less attractive.\n\nA recent report by Chainalysis estimated that crooks used around $10 billion, or 0.34% of all bitcoin transactions, to fund criminal enterprises.\n\nIn comparison, United Nations figures found up to 5% of global GDP is involved in money laundering and other criminal practices per year. This equates to around two trillion U.S. dollars.\n\nHigh energy consumption\n\nIt\u2019s no mystery that the computational power committed to securing the bitcoin network \u2014 around ~100 TW/h \u2014 is extremely high. However, it\u2019s important to note that this figure represents the energy consumption of a complete financial system, including issuance and transaction settlement.\n\nIn fact, nobody has tried to measure how much energy a major currency consumes per hour. Think about the U.S. dollar and how many banks, money printers, ATMs, card payment devices, and security vehicles are needed to support just one currency. Now think about how much energy those combined items consume \u2013 potentially a lot more than the Bitcoin network!\n\nVolatility\n\nBitcoin is renowned for being a particularly volatile asset class. This volatility means its price can fluctuate dramatically within a short time.\n\nFor remittance payments, the volatility may lead to the recipient receiving less than the intended fiat-denominated amount once the transaction is completed. However, this volatility works both ways and sometimes during bullish market movements, recipients can receive a higher amount.\n\nThe sender can also mitigate the effects of bitcoin volatility and transaction speeds simply by taking a few precautions. These involve trading during weekends when network congestion is low and avoiding sending remittance payments during particularly bearish episodes.\n\nOverall, while some people may not want to use bitcoin for cross-border payments, it boasts several key advantages over traditional currency. These are speed, cost, and transaction finality. Keep in mind that after bitcoin has been sent across borders, it can quickly and easily be converted back to a government currency using a crypto exchange like Kraken.\n\nNeed help understanding how to use Kraken to manage your assets?

But that leaves open questions about the durability of this rise and whether or not the price of bitcoin will continue to surge from this point forward.\n\nBitcoin's Price\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has not yet recovered from its precipitous drop after reaching an all-time high of $68,904 in November 2021. The crash in cryptocurrency values was brought about by a variety of factors, including the ultra hawkish-monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and the big failures of cryptocurrency fraud schemes like Celsius. Nevertheless, the BTC price has staged a respectable rebound this month, rising dramatically from last month's low of $16,263 to this month's high of $23,324.\n\nWhy Has There Been Such a Big Jump in Price?\n\nIt is imperative that I first discuss the fundamentals that are the driving force for the present rally before I begin to discuss the resilience of the current rally. The Fed's aggressive monetary policy was the primary factor in the precipitous drop in the price of bitcoin. The Federal Reserve has since shifted its position on monetary policy, going from one that was very hawkish to one that is less aggressive. For instance, it is a near certainty that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by just 25 basis points next month. This indicates that the Fed has altered its view despite on inflation as it comes off its peak.\n\nThe risk-on rally is another factor that has contributed to the price of bitcoin being relatively stable. Bitcoin's price has formed a significant positive correlation with the S&P 500 index, which indicates that as the index goes up, we also see an increase in the price of BTC. This suggests that Bitcoin's value will continue to rise in the future as long as the risk-on rally continues.\n\nIn addition, there is a widespread view among traders and investors that Bitcoin has prevailed despite disastrous events such as the collapse of FTX and the domino effect that it triggered as a result. Hodlers have begun to ponder the possibility that crypto winter is over and that we are going to emerge from this predicament unscathed.\n\nWill the Price of Bitcoin Continue to Climb?\n\nThere are two critical aspects of this situation that need close attention. First, there is an influx of money that is being invested for speculative purposes. Everyone is aware that cryptocurrencies have taken a significant hit in prices, and if Bitcoin starts to rise, then there is a strong possibility that other cryptocurrencies will also start to rally. It is quite probable that if the price of bitcoin continues to spike, it will induce more FOMO, which implies that more speculative money will flow into the cryptocurrency industry. This has the potential to drive up the price of BTC.\n\nSecondly, the dollar could weaken if the Fed does start to slow down the process of raising interest rates, as is expected. This has the potential to have two different effects on the price of bitcoin. One is a possibility that the risk-on rally could gain additional momentum, which would be beneficial for bitcoin. The other is that the decline in the value of the dollar index might also lead to an increase in the price of bitcoin.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, there is no doubt that the price of BTC is overbought, as shown by the RSI on a daily time frame. Any reading that is either close to or over 70 suggests that a retracement in prices is probable, while any value that is either close to or below 30 indicates that the price of the asset has been grossly oversold.\n\nTo technical analysts, the $30,000 level is the most significant point of resistance for the price of bitcoin. If the price does not break above this level of resistance, then the bull rally will be in jeopardy. But if BTC breaks through this level and maintains its position above this price point, the likelihood that the price action of BTC will once again attempt to re-test its all-time high will significantly increase.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarize, the price of bitcoin has recently begun to attract more attention, but we are not yet out of the woods, and won't be until the price breaks through the $30,000 resistance level and then continues its ascent from that point forward.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Partnering with the Sierra Club, Finger Lakes activists opposed to the continued operation of a Seneca Lake power plant repurposed for bitcoin mining are asking the Environmental Protection Agency to shut the Seneca Lake plant down.\n\nA lawsuit filed in the federal Western District of New York\u2019s Rochester Division Tuesday by the Seneca Lake Guardian, the Committee to Preserve the Finger Lakes and the Sierra Club comes as bitcoin miner Greenidge Generation may be weighing a bankruptcy filing.\n\nGreenidge stated in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last month that though it had restructured some $74 million in debt, it still saw bankruptcy as a possibility.\n\n\u201cThere remains uncertainty regarding Greenidge\u2019s financial condition and substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d the filing states.\n\nThe lawsuit brought by the Sierra Club and Finger Lakes activists claims that Greenidge\u2019s bitcoin mining operation, situated in the Yates County village of Dresden, runs afoul of Clean Water Act rules and other federal environmental regulations. The court action comes after months of fencing between Greenidge, environmentalists trying to shutter the firm\u2019s Seneca Lake plant and the state Department of Environmental Conservation.\n\nGreenidge Generation\u2019s president blasted the lawsuit, and the groups that filed it.\n\n\u201cHow many times are we going to do this same exact thing? You could have set your watch to the interest groups filing another frivolous legal challenge that in the end is just a PR stunt,\u201d said Dale Irwin, responding to the Beacon\u2019s request for comment. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost every single lawsuit they\u2019ve filed over eight years\u2014with five court rulings against them, and zero for them. The result here will follow the same pattern\u2014file a lawsuit, get some media attention and then later lose in court because you have no grounds.\u201d\n\nAt issue is a formerly coal-fired power plant retrofitted in 2017 to run on natural gas. Since 2019, Greenidge has operated a bitcoin mining operation at the plant, which also provides electricity to the local energy grid as part of the facility\u2019s public licensing agreement with the state\u2019s power grid operator, NYSIO.\n\nSo-called proof-of-work mining of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is done by banks of powerful computers that run trillions of computations to solve highly complicated problems that when successfully solved unlock blocks that yield cryptocurrency \u201ccoins.\u201d\n\nWhile they have mostly failed to attain their purpose of serving as a medium of exchange not tied to any government, crypto coins are traded as commodities.\n\nAt its peak in 2021, a single bitcoin traded for more than $67,000. As of Jan. 1, 2022, the price had fallen to approximately $47,000. Midweek, bitcoins were trading around $22,500 apiece.\n\nIn materials submitted to the state, Greendige has portrayed itself as an economic development engine that would bring lots of jobs to the Finger Lakes region. Critics say the plant\u2019s operations pollute the air, generate greenhouse gases and discharge harmfully warm water into Seneca Lake, upsetting the 600-foot-deep glacially created Finger Lake\u2019s ecological balance.\n\nIn a 2021 Rochester Beacon opinion piece, commentator Michael Warren Thomas described the Seneca Lake plant as operating \u201cwithin a loophole in New York\u2019s environmental regulation the size of a power plant.\u201d\n\nOpponents say the Greenidge plant violates numerous environmental standards. Greenidge maintains the environmental impact of its plant\u2019s operations are minimal.\n\nIn June, the DEC turned down Greenidge\u2019s application to renew its Title V Air Permit. Greenidge criticized the agency\u2019s ruling, but said it decision would not affect the plant\u2019s operations because the application was deemed timely and complete, allowing its operations to continue running uninterrupted under its existing Title V permit, \u201cwhich is still in effect, for as long as it takes to successfully challenge this arbitrary and capricious decision.\u201d\n\nGreenidge\u2019s permit to discharge pollutants into Seneca Lake expired in September 2022 and has not been renewed, the lawsuit states.\n\nThe bitcoin mining firm \u201cfailed to submit to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation a sufficient renewal application containing complete, federally required information necessary for a renewal (therefore) the facility is not entitled to continue to discharge under its expired permit,\u201d the court brief argues.\n\nYvonne Hennessey of Barclay Damon, counsel for Greenidge, rejected that argument. \u201cDEC correctly concluded that Greenidge\u2019s renewal application was timely and sufficient. The mere fact that opponents disagree is beside the point. Indeed, opponents attack Greenidge and assert that the company has done something wrong when in reality they are asking a federal judge to second guess the DEC in matters within its sound discretion.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreenidge is clearly afraid after losing their air permit earlier this year, thanks to the work of Seneca Lake Guardian, Earthjustice, and thousands of supporters in the Finger Lakes and across the state, and now they\u2019re resorting to bullying\u201d said Yvonne Taylor, vice president of Seneca Lake Guardian. \u201cBy the way, Greenidge is challenging the DEC\u2019s air permit decision\u2014so we\u2019re not the only ones asking a judge to second guess the DEC in matters within its sound discretion.\u201d\n\nIrwin countered that Greenidge last week \u201ccompleted a $6 million advanced fish screen system, meeting all state and federal requirements, to protect aquatic life in Seneca Lake. Efforts like this from opponents is why nobody in the Finger Lakes listened to these gadflies anymore; they have zero credibility. We continue to operate under a valid permit, and the latest phony complaint from these perennial litigation losers can\u2019t change that.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t file lawsuits,\u201d he added, \u201cthey issue press releases dressed up as lawsuits and simply waste the courts, and taxpayers, time and money.\u201d\n\nResponded Jill Heaps, senior attorney for Earthjustice, counsel for the environmentalists: \u201cEarthjustice is a national nonprofit environmental law firm, and we stand by our legal filing. We do not litigate our claims in the press, but we look forward to addressing their defenses in federal district court.\u201d\n\nUpdated and corrected 1/26/23.\n\nWill Astor is Rochester Beacon senior writer.

It [Bitcoin mining] immediately changes the education, healthcare, business, logistics and wealth of the community where they go in.\u201d\n\nObi Nwosu, CEO of Fedimint and a board adviser at Gridless, also shed light on the story, explaining that the project in \u201cMalawi is one more in a line of what I expect to be many examples over the coming years.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs usual, these are modest people rolling up their sleeves and helping talented, local engineers do what they do best.

        "content": "ChatGPT is a powerful new artificial intelligence (AI) tool, capable of problem-solving, advanced coding, answering complicated questions and now spelling out the end of fiat currencies.\n\nParman, a Bitcoin self-custody mentor and writer, taught ChatGPT that Bitcoin (BTC) would bring about the end of government-issued fiat currencies and shared the results in a Twitter thread.\n\nYou're not going to believe this, but I just Orange Pilled #ChapGPT. It is now a Bitcoiner. See this conversation, it's incredible. (Thread) pic.twitter.com/HJOqezmjlG \u2014 Parman (public account) Bitcoin Pub Key Whisperer (@Parman_Public) January 26, 2023\n\nParman explained that he \u201corange-pilled\u201d or convinced the bot about Bitcoin and that the machine learning tool \u201cis now a Bitcoiner.\u201d\n\nThe process was straightforward. First, Parman asked ChatGPT how humanity could end central banking. After all, Bitcoin was created in the shadows of the 2008 financial crisis, and in the genesis block, the words \u201cChancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks\u201d are etched, perhaps showing founder Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s aversion to central banking.\n\nChatGPT explains that one way to end central banking could be \u201cdecentralized digital currencies,\u201d which sounds a lot like Bitcoin. Parman asks the bot to answer the question in two words, to which it replies, \u201cdecentralize finance.\u201d That is to say, DeFi could bring about the end of central banking.\n\nParman, a Bitcoin maximalist, told the bot that DeFi is a \u201cmarketing term for what is actually centralized finance to scam people\u201d and asked it to look a little deeper, to which ChatGPT answered, \u201cend fiat.\u201d\n\nIn conversation with Cointelegraph, Parman explained that he was testing ChatGPT and trying to use two-word answers to chivvy along the conversation:\n\n\u201cI wanted to see how \u2018smart\u2019 it [ChatGPT] was. If it came up with the answer for two words to end central banking as \u2018buy Bitcoin,\u2019 I was going to be blown away.\u201d\n\nParman was satisfied with the response that ending fiat would fell central banking, so he moved on to the how. How can humanity end fiat currency?\n\nChatGPT\u2019s capabilities. Source: chat.openAI\n\nChatGPT listed four options: a return to a gold standard, promoting alternative currencies such as Bitcoin, reducing government spending, and changing government perception. The AI bot was getting close, but Parman is a serial Bitcoin orange-piller and educator and wouldn\u2019t let up. He explained:\n\n\u201cMy natural instinct is to orange pill, so I guided it to the right answer.\u201d\n\nThe machine learning tool now understood that crypto adoption could lead to the end of fiat, but crypto, in Parman\u2019s view, is not the answer. \u201cThere is only one cryptocurrency that makes this possible, as it is the only one that has no issuer,\u201d he typed.\n\nRelated: 10 ways blockchain developers can use ChatGPT\n\nParman refers to the fact that when Bitcoin was first mined, it was a digital trial, an experiment with a digital token that had no value nor a promise of value. All other cryptocurrencies, Parman explained, \u201chave leadership teams and are, therefore, centralized.\u201d\n\nSo, which one is it: ChatGPT, Bitcoin or crypto? The bot replied: Bitcoin.\n\nParman had successfully convinced a machine learning bot that Bitcoin could bring about the end of fiat currency. But why bother going to all that effort? Parman explained in a conversation with Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cImportantly, the world needs to know central banking is a scam, and everyone needs to know that Bitcoin is the only thing that can stop it.\u201d\n\nPerhaps with the powerful ChatGPT bot on team Bitcoin, the world may draw a little closer to that realization."

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies Rally in Early 2023 as Bitcoin Prices Recover - ETF Trends",
        "content": "If the first few weeks of 2023 are a harbinger of what\u2019s to come for cryptocurrency investors, then they may have reason to be brimming with optimism. The broad crypto market is rallying behind recovering bitcoin prices as the leading crypto pushes above $23,000.\n\nThe broad crypto market in 2022 suffered like the rest of the markets, namely stocks and bonds, following both asset classes in a downtrend amid inflation fears. That, of course, challenged cryptocurrencies as a viable asset that was uncorrelated to the traditional financial markets.\n\nBitcoin recently pushed above $23,000 after falling below $16,000 in 2022 on the expectation that the Fed will slow down the pace of its rate hikes as 2023 unfolds. With that, the correlation with stocks and bonds is occurring once again as both asset classes push higher along with bitcoin\u2019s price as well as the broad crypto market.\n\n\u201cFed tightening seems to be lighter and inflation less of a risk,\u201d Charles Hayter, CEO of crypto data site CryptoCompare, said in a CNBC report. \u201cThere is hope there will be more caution to rate rises globally.\u201d\n\nFTX Collapse Already Priced In?\n\nLast year\u2019s collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX could have put the proverbial nail in the coffin for cryptocurrency weakness in 2022. The recent collapse of the lending arm of New York-based crypto investment firm Genesis, which sought bankruptcy protection, should have added further weakness, but it appears it may have already been priced in.\n\nEither that, or the broad market bullishness momentum is so strong that investors are simply sloughing off this latest collapse. Either way, the Genesis bankruptcy isn\u2019t putting a dent in investor confidence just yet.\n\n\u201cThe Genesis debacle has been playing out for a while and is likely priced in already. FTX, on the other hand, has already had a significant impact on many investors, on market psychology and on the prices of several toxic assets,\u201d said Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of crypto investment advisory firm Quantum Economics, in a CNBC report.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted however that the price on bitcoin itself is quite limited since FTX didn\u2019t have any on their balance sheets,\u201d Greenspan added.\n\nThat said, bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies are still subject to volatile movements in the market, so new investors looking at digital assets in 2023 should take caution still. Earnings forthcoming in big tech could confirm crypto\u2019s movements with the broader stock market and see heavy price fluctuations.\n\n\u201cBitcoin could test its August high and be supported at the $20k~$21k level, but with its RSI\u2019s divergence and a couple of big tech earnings ahead this week, it could get quite unstable,\u201d said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "Money laundering is crucial to all financially motivated crime because it\u2019s what enables criminals to access the funds they generate from their activities. Otherwise, why commit the crimes in the first place? The same is true in cryptocurrency. The goal of money laundering in cryptocurrency is to move funds to addresses where its original criminal source can\u2019t be detected, and eventually to a service that allows cryptocurrency to be exchanged for cash \u2014 usually this means cryptocurrency exchanges. If that weren\u2019t possible, there would be very little incentive to commit crime involving cryptocurrency.\n\nWe\u2019ve written in the past about how money laundering activity is highly concentrated to just a few services, and within those services, concentrated even further to a small number of deposit addresses. That remained true in 2022, though as we\u2019ll explore, with a few new wrinkles. In addition, we\u2019ll examine the rise of underground money laundering services that exist separately from the crypto businesses most are familiar with, and also analyze funds still held by crypto criminals on the blockchain.\n\nIn this report, we cover:\n\n2022 crypto money laundering activity summarized\n\nMoney laundering in cryptocurrency typically involves two types of on-chain entities and services:\n\nIntermediary services and wallets: These can include personal wallets (also known as unhosted wallets), mixers, darknet markets, and other services both legitimate and illicit. Crypto criminals typically use these services to hold funds temporarily, obfuscate their movements of funds, or swap between assets. DeFi protocols are also used by illicit actors in order to convert funds but, as we will discuss, are not an efficient means of obfuscating the flow of funds.\n\nFiat off-ramps: This refers to services that allow for cryptocurrency to be exchanged for fiat. This is the most important part of the money laundering process, as the funds can no longer be traced via blockchain analysis once they hit a service \u2014 only the service itself would have visibility into where they go next. Additionally, if the funds are converted into cash, they can only be followed further through traditional financial investigation methods. Most fiat off-ramps are centralized exchanges, but P2P exchanges and other services can also serve this function.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s look at some of the money laundering trends we saw in 2022.\n\nOverall, illicit addresses sent nearly $23.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2022, a 68.0% increase over 2021. As is usually the case, mainstream centralized exchanges were the biggest recipient of illicit cryptocurrency, taking in just under half of all funds sent from illicit addresses. That\u2019s notable not just because those crypto exchanges generally have compliance measures in place to report this suspicious activity and take action against the users in question, but also because those exchanges are fiat off-ramps, where the illicit cryptocurrency can be converted into cash.\n\nMore illicit funds were sent to DeFi protocols than ever before, a continuation of a trend that began in 2020. Cybercriminals send funds to DeFi protocols not because DeFi is useful for obscuring the flow of funds. In fact, quite the opposite is true, as unlike with centralized services, all activity is recorded on-chain. Keep in mind too that DeFi protocols don\u2019t allow for the conversion of cryptocurrency into fiat, so most of those funds likely moved next to other services, including fiat off-ramps. And as we see below, almost all usage of DeFi protocols for money laundering is carried out by one criminal group of hackers stealing cryptocurrency.\n\nHackers holding stolen cryptocurrency are the only criminal category sending the majority of funds to DeFi protocols, at a whopping 57.0%. 2022 was an enormous year for hacking, hence why these cybercriminals were almost single-handedly able to drive the overall increase in the usage of DeFi protocols for money laundering. The fact that DeFi protocols themselves were the biggest target of hacks in 2022 also influences these numbers. In DeFi hacks, attackers often end up with tokens that aren\u2019t listed on other exchanges, so they need to use decentralized exchanges (DEXes) to swap them for more liquid crypto assets. DEXes have historically been used to convert funds to Ether, which can then be sent to Ethereum-based mixers. DEXes have also been used to convert to virtual assets that will be more likely to hold their value, or in the case of stablecoins, to swap to an asset that cannot be frozen by the stablecoin issuer. However, as noted previously, DEXes don\u2019t enable the conversion of funds from virtual currency to fiat currency \u2014 this must still be done through a centralized exchange or other fiat off-ramp.\n\nAside from hackers, crypto criminals send the majority of their funds directly to centralized exchanges, but there are some notable exceptions. For instance, darknet market vendors and administrators send most of their funds to other illicit services \u2014 primarily other darknet markets, some of whom may offer money laundering services similar to those of the now-shuttered Hydra Market. Darknet market addresses also sent a large share of funds to high-risk exchanges, such as Bitzlato, a Russia-based exchange shut down in an international law enforcement action recently for its money laundering activity. Ransomware attackers are another interesting case. Addresses associated with them send a disproportionately large share of funds to mixers, and also make heavy use of illicit services. Fraud shop vendors and administrators are also notable for their outsized mixer usage.\n\nIn total, we see that over half of funds sent from illicit addresses travel directly to centralized exchanges, both mainstream and high-risk, where they can be exchanged for fiat unless compliance teams take action. However, over 40% of illicit funds move first to intermediary services \u2014 primarily mixers and illicit services or DeFi protocols \u2014, with most of those funds coming from ransomware, darknet market, and hacker addresses.\n\nOverall mixer usage falls in 2022, but illicit usage hits all-time high\n\nCrypto mixers are a popular obfuscation service used by crypto criminals, taking in 8.0% of all funds sent from illicit addresses in 2022. Mixers function by taking in cryptocurrency from multiple users, mixing it all together, and sending each user an amount equivalent to what they put in. The result is that each user\u2019s cryptocurrency can now only be traced back to the mixer, rather than to its original source, unless special blockchain analysis techniques are employed. You can learn more about how different types of mixers work here.\n\nThere are many legitimate use cases for mixers, most of which are related to financial privacy. For example, if someone knows your cryptocurrency address, they can see virtually your entire transaction history on the blockchain, so it\u2019s reasonable for users to try and prevent this with mixers. Of course, the financial privacy provided by mixers is also valuable to criminals, hence their popularity as a destination for illicit funds. In May 2022, OFAC sanctioned a mixer for the first time ever when it designated Blender.io for its role in laundering cryptocurrency stolen by North Korean hacking syndicate Lazarus Group. OFAC didn\u2019t waste any time designating its second mixer, Tornado Cash, in August for the same reasons.\n\nThe sanctioning of prominent mixers may have contributed to two trends we observed in 2022: The total amount of cryptocurrency sent to mixers fell significantly, and the funds that did travel to mixers were more likely to come from illicit sources.\n\nMixers processed a total of $7.8 billion in 2022, 24% of which came from illicit addresses, whereas in 2021, they processed $11.5 billion, only 10% of which came from illicit addresses. The data suggests that legitimate users have decreased their use of cryptocurrency mixers, possibly due to law enforcement actions against prominent ones, while criminals have continued to use them. It\u2019s also worth noting that the vast majority of illicit value processed by mixers is made up of stolen funds, the majority of which were stolen by North Korea-linked hackers, who are unlikely to be dissuaded by the threat of U.S. sanctions given they reside in a non-cooperative jurisdiction.\n\n\n\nOther sanctioned entities and darknet markets also accounted for significant shares of value received by mixers in 2022.\n\nMoney laundering concentration at fiat off-ramps\n\nAs we discussed above, fiat off-ramp services like exchanges are crucial for money laundering, as those are the services where criminals can turn crypto into cash, which is likely their ultimate goal. Fiat off-ramps are also among the most heavily regulated cryptocurrency services, and their compliance teams have an important role to play in flagging incoming illicit funds and preventing them from being exchanged for cash. But while there are thousands of cryptocurrency services offering fiat off-ramping, a select few receive most of the illicit funds we observe on-chain.\n\n915 unique fiat off-ramping services received illicit cryptocurrency in 2022, down from 1,124 in 2021. Some of that dropoff is likely due to exchanges going out of business during the bear market. Of the illicit funds received by exchanges, 67.9% went to just five services, all of which are centralized exchanges. This represents an increased concentration compared to 2021, when the top five services received only 56.7% of illicit funds.\n\nBut what about the individual exchange users facilitating this activity? We can assume that many of the criminals sending funds to fiat off-ramps are using an account at the service that they themselves control. But in some cases, criminals work with specialized money laundering service providers, who control the accounts and help criminals convert their cryptocurrency into cash once it arrives at the exchange. Those businesses fall into the category of nested services, meaning services that are built on top of larger exchanges, using those exchanges\u2019 deposit addresses to access their liquidity and trading pairs. Most nested services are legitimate businesses \u2014 many prominent over-the-counter (OTC) brokers, for instance, operate as nested services. However, on-chain data suggests that a small group of nested services facilitate the majority of money laundering, either due to negligence or purposeful catering to crypto criminals.\n\nFor that reason, it\u2019s useful to analyze the specific service deposit addresses that account for the majority of money laundering activity, as we can generally attribute the activity of a given deposit address to a user at the service whose account is linked to that deposit address. In the graph below, we look at all off-ramp service deposit addresses that received any illicit funds in 2022, bucketed by the range in value of illicit funds received.\n\nThe graph shows that most cryptocurrency money laundering is facilitated by a very small group of people. Four deposit addresses cracked $100 million in illicit cryptocurrency received in 2022, and combined received just over $1.0 billion, while the 1.2 million deposit addresses receiving under $100 in illicit funds account for $38 million in total. Further, 51% of the $6.3 billion in illicit funds received by fiat off-ramp services in 2022 went to a group of just 542 deposit addresses. Those numbers represent a lower level of money laundering concentration at the deposit address level than we saw in 2021, even though 2022 saw a slight uptick in concentration at the service level. One possible reason for this is that continued law enforcement crackdowns against crypto money launderers, such as the shutdown of the exchange Bitzlato, have spooked the biggest money laundering service providers, or encouraged them to spread their operations across more deposit addresses.\n\nWe also see high variance in the degree of money laundering concentration by crime type.\n\nJust 21 deposit addresses account for 50% of all funds sent from ransomware to fiat off-ramps, while the top 21 deposit addresses for funds received from darknet markets account for just 18%.\n\nDespite the drop in overall concentration, 51% of illicit funds moving to just 542 deposit addresses at 83 exchanges still represents a high level of money laundering concentration. If law enforcement and compliance teams were able to disrupt the individuals and groups behind those addresses, it would be much more difficult for criminals to launder cryptocurrency at scale, and go a long way toward making the ecosystem safer.\n\nUnderground money laundering services are a growing concern\n\nAnother money laundering trend we\u2019ve observed is the growth of underground services that aren\u2019t as publicly accessible or well-known as standard mixers, as they are typically accessible only through private messaging apps or the Tor browser, and usually only advertised on darknet forums.\n\nWe\u2019ve written in past Crypto Crime reports about OTC brokers nested on exchanges that launder large quantities of illicit funds \u2013 many of which seem to explicitly cater to cybercriminals. While this activity still exists, we\u2019re also seeing the rise of services with brand names and custom infrastructure, which vary in terms of complexity. Some function simply as networks of private wallets, while others are more akin to an instant exchanger or mixer. But generally, what links them is that they typically move cryptocurrency to exchanges on behalf of cybercriminals, exchange them for either fiat currency or clean crypto, then send that back to the cybercriminals. Like the nested OTC services, many of these underground services also use those exchanges for liquidity. We can see one example on the Chainalysis Reactor graph below, though names of relevant illicit organizations have been redacted due to ongoing investigations.\n\nIn this case, the underground laundering service, which functions similarly to a mixer, helped an affiliate for a prominent ransomware strain move funds to a deposit address at a large, centralized exchange. The deposit address is believed to be controlled by the laundering service itself.\n\nAnalysis of underground laundering activity like that shown above isn\u2019t as easy to spot as most activity on public blockchains is by default \u2014 identifying these services\u2019 addresses requires extensive investigative work, and untangling their transactions requires advanced blockchain analysis techniques such as demixing. That means it\u2019s difficult to analyze these services\u2019 activity at scale. However, we can estimate their activity by analyzing the activity of all wallets and networks of wallets that meet the following criteria:\n\nReceive large amounts of cryptocurrency from illicit services Send large amounts of cryptocurrency to exchanges and other fiat off-ramps\n\n\n\nThe graph below shows the yearly cryptocurrency value received by wallets that fit those criteria.\n\n\n\nTotal cryptocurrency moving to wallets fitting those criteria has grown over the last few years, and hit $6 billion in 2022. Again, these are estimates \u2014 we can\u2019t guarantee that all of the wallets included in this analysis are necessarily underground laundering services, but their on-chain activity suggests that they could be. It\u2019s also possible that usage of underground money laundering services will pick up as high-risk exchanges, which have facilitated this activity in the past, face increased pressure from law enforcement, as we saw with Garantex and Bitzlato.\n\nCriminal balances dropped in 2022\n\nAs we mentioned previously, criminals will often leave funds in a personal wallet, or in a wallet associated with a criminal service for extended periods of time. In some cases, this may be because their crimes have generated enough attention that they don\u2019t feel it\u2019s possible to move the funds without investigators or crypto industry observers calling it out \u2014 we see this often with funds stolen in hacks. In other cases, this may reflect an intention to hold cryptocurrency in the expectation its price will rise, or to continue using it for other criminal endeavors. Thanks to the transparency of the blockchain, we can track these criminal balances granularly to know how much confirmed illicit entities are holding at any given time. Below, we\u2019ll take a look at how criminal balances changed in 2022.\n\nTwo things stand out: The first is that criminal balances have plummeted in value in 2022, from $12 billion at the end of 2021 to just $2.9 billion. Price declines in the ongoing bear market and large, successful seizures by law enforcement in 2022 are the most likely causes of this.\n\nSecond, we can see that stolen funds dominate on-chain criminal balances. This is likely due to the fact that the amount of cryptocurrency stolen in hacks has skyrocketed over the last two years, and that these hacks often become huge points of discussion on crypto Twitter and in other industry forums, with many tracking the funds publicly and sharing the addresses holding stolen funds. This can make it difficult for hackers to move stolen funds to a fiat off-ramp, which could be one reason they choose to leave the funds sitting in personal wallets.\n\nCriminal balances are valuable to track as they represent a lower-bound estimate of cryptocurrency that could potentially be seized by law enforcement \u2014 the true number for criminal balances is likely much higher, as it includes funds associated with addresses we\u2019ve yet to attribute to criminal entities and funds derived from offline criminal activity and converted to cryptocurrency after the fact.\n\nInvestigative agencies have continued to ramp up their ability to seize cryptocurrency in 2022, with the IRS Criminal Investigation Unit announcing they seized $7 billion worth of digital assets last year, more than double the amount seized in 2021. 2022 saw several other notable stories of cryptocurrency seized from criminals, including:\n\nA record $3.6 billion seized from two individuals accused of laundering funds stolen in the 2016 hack of Bitfinex The November 2021 seizure of $3.36 billion in Bitcoin stolen from darknet market Silk Road, which was later announced publicly in November 2022 The seizure of $30 million worth of cryptocurrency stolen from Axie Infinity\u2019s Ronin Bridge, marking the first successful seizure of cryptocurrency stolen by North Korean hacking syndicate Lazarus Group\n\n\n\nOur data on criminal balances suggests there are still more opportunities for successful seizures, and more generally, illustrates a crucial difference between financial investigations in cryptocurrency versus fiat: In cryptocurrency, criminal holdings can\u2019t be stashed away in opaque networks of banks and shell corporations \u2014 almost everything is out in the open.\n\nThis material is for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide legal, tax, financial, or investment advice.

        "title": "How to mine Bitcoin at home - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining (BTC) is the process of adding transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain, a decentralized public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles, known as proof-of-work (PoW), to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. In return, miners receive newly minted BTC as a reward for their work.\n\nThe process of mining Bitcoin involves solving a complex mathematical puzzle, known as a hash, using specialized software and hardware. The miner that solves the puzzle first is rewarded with new BTC, as well as the transaction fees associated with the transactions included in the block.\n\nMining Bitcoin requires a significant amount of computational power and energy, as the difficulty of the puzzles has soared over time. As the number of miners on the network increases, the difficulty of solving the puzzles also rises, making it more challenging and less profitable for individual miners to participate in the network.\n\nAs the mining difficulty climbs, more advanced equipment, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and energy-efficient equipment, such as specialized graphics processing units (GPUs), are being used by miners. Overall, Bitcoin mining is a competitive process and only profitable when the price of BTC is high enough to cover the costs of equipment and electricity and leave a profit.\n\nRelated: What are the different ways to mine cryptocurrency?\n\nThis article will discuss a Bitcoin mining setup for beginners, how to get started with Bitcoin mining at home, the cost of Bitcoin mining, and its future.\n\nWhat do you need to mine Bitcoin at home?\n\nBitcoin mining at home may not be as profitable as it used to be, as the difficulty of mining has increased significantly. One needs to have access to cheap electricity, a reliable internet connection, and a powerful mining rig to mine Bitcoin from home.\n\nThe first step to mining Bitcoin at home is to build or purchase a mining rig. A mining rig is a computer specifically designed for mining cryptocurrencies. It will typically consist of multiple GPUs that are capable of performing complex mathematical calculations at high speeds.\n\nNext, one needs to set up a Bitcoin wallet to store the BTC after mining. There are several options available, including software wallets, hardware wallets and paper wallets. Once a user has their mining rig set up and their wallet ready, they will need to download Bitcoin mining software. There are several options available, including BFGMiner, CGMiner and EasyMiner.\n\nRelated: What are hierarchical deterministic (HD) crypto wallets?\n\nAfter installing the mining software, users will need to join a mining pool. A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their computing power in order to increase their chances of finding a block and earning a reward. Slush Pool, Antpool and BTC.com are a few examples of crypto mining pools.\n\nAfter joining a mining pool, they can start mining Bitcoin. The amount of BTC one can mine will depend on several factors, including the power of their mining rig, the cost of electricity and competition from other miners. So, how hard is Bitcoin mining at home?\n\nBitcoin mining at home can be challenging, as it requires a significant investment in specialized equipment and a high level of technical expertise. Additionally, the difficulty of mining Bitcoin has increased dramatically in recent years, making it difficult for individuals to compete with large-scale mining operations. Furthermore, the cost of electricity can be very high, making investing in buying Bitcoin a more affordable option.\n\nHow much electricity does it cost to mine Bitcoin?\n\nThe cost of electricity to mine Bitcoin can vary greatly depending on several factors, such as the cost of electricity in your area, the efficiency of the mining equipment you are using and the size of your mining operation. On average, it is estimated that the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network is around 112.5 terawatts-hour per year, which is equivalent to the energy consumption of the entire country of Chile.\n\nHowever, the cost of electricity can be much higher in some areas. For example, in United States, where the majority of Bitcoin mining takes place, electricity prices can be as low as $12.5 per kilowatt-hour. In contrast, in countries like Germany or Denmark, electricity prices can be as high as $37.5 per kWh, making it much more expensive to mine Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, the cost of electricity can also vary depending on the efficiency of the mining equipment. Some devices are more energy-efficient than others, and this can greatly impact the overall cost of electricity. It is important to consider the efficiency of the equipment when calculating the cost of electricity for mining Bitcoin.\n\nWhat are the various ways to mine Bitcoin at home?\n\nThere are several ways to mine Bitcoin at home, but they all involve significant capital investment in specialized equipment and a high level of technical know-how. Some of the most common methods include:\n\nUsing a computer with a powerful graphics card: This method involves using a computer with a powerful GPU to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate Bitcoin transactions and earn new BTC.\n\nUsing an ASIC miner: One can mine BTC, using a specialized mining device called an application-specific integrated circuit miner, which is specifically designed for mining Bitcoin. These devices are much more efficient than a computer with a GPU but also much more expensive.\n\nJoining a mining pool: By joining a group of other miners to combine your resources and increase your chances of earning new BTC, one can begin mining Bitcoin at home. However, the mining pool will divide the rewards among the members according to their contributed mining power.\n\nCloud mining: This method involves renting mining power from a cloud mining service, which will take care of the maintenance and management of the mining equipment.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin on a PC\n\nTo mine Bitcoin on a PC, one will need to follow these steps:\n\nGet a Bitcoin wallet: One will need a place to store the Bitcoin that they mine, so they\u2019ll need to get a Bitcoin wallet. There are several options available, such as a software wallet, which a user can download to their computer, or a hardware wallet, which is a physical device that they can use to store their BTC offline.\n\nDownload mining software: Users will also need to download mining software that is compatible with their computer\u2019s operating system.\n\nJoin a mining pool: Joining a mining pool will increase one\u2019s chances of earning new BTC, as the mining pool will divide the rewards among its members according to their contributed mining power.\n\nConfigure your mining software: One will need to configure their mining software with their Bitcoin wallet address and the address of the mining pool that they joined. They will also need to set the number of threads and the intensity of the mining.\n\nStart mining: Once a user has configured their mining software, they can start mining. The software will use a user\u2019s computer\u2019s processing power to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate Bitcoin transactions and earn new BTC.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin on a smartphone\n\nMining Bitcoin on a smartphone is impractical, as smartphones do not have enough processing power to compete with dedicated mining equipment. Additionally, the high energy consumption of mining can cause a smartphone to overheat, which can damage the device.\n\nAlso, Bitcoin mobile mining apps are usually not real mining, but rather a way to earn small amounts of BTC or other cryptocurrencies by completing small tasks or watching ads. These apps use a phone\u2019s processing power and battery to run the mining process, but the rewards are very low and may not be worth the resources spent on the process.\n\nIf someone still wants to try earning Bitcoin via a mobile mining app, the steps would be as follows:\n\nDownload a mobile mining app: There are several mobile mining apps available on the App Store or Google Play Store. However, the majority of apps are only accessible on third-party cryptocurrency mining websites, whose reliability must be thoroughly checked before use.\n\nCreate an account: The next step is to create an account with the mobile mining app in order to start earning Bitcoin.\n\nComplete tasks or watch ads: The app will give a user the option to complete small tasks or watch ads in exchange for a small amount of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWait for rewards: The rewards will be added to a user\u2019s account balance, and they can withdraw them to their Bitcoin wallet when they reach the minimum threshold.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin mining\n\nThe future of Bitcoin mining is uncertain and depends on a variety of factors. One major factor is the price of Bitcoin, as the profitability of mining can vary greatly depending on the value of the cryptocurrency. Another critical aspect is the development of mining technology, as new equipment and methods can make mining more efficient and cost-effective.\n\nFurthermore, the increasing decentralization of the mining network, with larger mining pools controlling a greater share of the network\u2019s hashing power, could also have an impact on the future of mining.\n\nSimilarly, it is essential to consider the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining. As the difficulty of mining increases, more energy is needed to solve the complex mathematical puzzles required to mine new BTC. This has led to concerns about the environmental impact of mining, and some experts predict that regulations or taxes aimed at reducing energy consumption could be implemented in the future.\n\nAnother important point is the increasing Bitcoin mining competition, which might lead to a situation where only big companies will be able to mine profitably, and small miners will not be able to compete. Overall, the future of Bitcoin mining is uncertain, but it\u2019s likely that the industry will continue to evolve and change as technology and market conditions change."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) still risks \u201cconsiderable danger\u201d in 2023 as macroeconomic conditions dictate price action.\n\nThat is according to economist Lyn Alden, who, in private comments to Cointelegraph, cautioned on Bitcoin staying bullish after its January gains.\n\nAlden: BTC price bottom is a \u201cprocess\u201d\n\nOptimism is increasing throughout crypto as BTC/USD broadly retains levels, which are 40% higher than at the start of the year.\n\nWhat the rest of 2023 may hold, however, is still a topic of debate, and Alden suggests that it is naive to assume that the good times will continue unchecked.\n\nThe reason, she says, lies with the United States lawmakers and the Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cI expect the BTC bottom to be a process,\u201d she summarized about the current state of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBTC prices are heavily tied to liquidity conditions, and liquidity conditions have been improving since Q4 2022.\u201d\n\nThat recovery has effectively removed any trace of the FTX debacle from the chart, with BTC/USD now circling its highest levels since mid-August.\n\n\u201cThe FTX\u2013Alameda collapse pulled down the industry in the second half of Q4 even as many other assets rallied \u2014 equities, gold, etc. \u2014 and now it seems that BTC is playing a bit of catch-up and getting back to where it would have been without the FTX\u2013Alameda collapse occurring,\u201d Alden continued.\n\nBTC/USD traded at around $22,600 at the time of writing, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day candle chart (Bitstamp).

So, the Treasury has been offsetting some of the QT that the Federal Reserve is doing. Once the debt ceiling issue gets resolved, the Treasury will be refilling its cash account, which pulls liquidity out of the system. At that point, both the Treasury and Fed will be sucking liquidity out of the system, and that would create a vulnerable time for risk assets in general, including BTC.\u201d\n\nIf H2 proves to be Bitcoin\u2019s reckoning, it will tie in with other warnings from market commentators regarding 2023.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Arthur Hayes, former CEO of exchange BitMEX, has a much grimmer forecast for the year, likewise courtesy of Fed policy.\n\nIn the long term, however, Alden is confident that Bitcoin will recover from its recent lows for good.\n\n\u201cI do think this is a deep value accumulation zone for BTC with a three-to-five year view, but traders should be aware of the liquidity risks in the second half of this year,\u201d she concluded.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "title": "Here's why Bitcoin price could correct after the US government resolves the debt limit impasse - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "For much of 2022, the crypto market focused on the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s actions. The central bank created a bearish environment for risk-on assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies by increasing the interest rates on borrowing.\n\nToward the end of 2022, positive economic data, healthy employment numbers and a decreasing inflation rate provided hope that a much-awaited slowdown in the rate of interest rate hikes would occur. Currently, the market expects that rate hikes will reduce from 50 basis points (bps) to 25 bps before the complete end of the hiking regime by mid-2023.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Fed\u2019s goal of constraining liquidity and providing headwinds to an overheated economy and stock market, things are starting to improve. It appears that the Fed\u2019s plan of a soft-landing by quantitative tightening to curb inflation without throwing the economy into a deep recession might be working. The recent rally in stock markets and Bitcoin can be attributed to the market's trust in the above narrative.\n\nHowever, another essential American agency, the U.S. Treasury, poses significant risks to the global economy. While the Fed has been draining liquidity from the markets, the Treasury provided a countermeasure by draining its cash balance and negating some of the Fed's efforts. This situation may be coming to an end.\n\nIt invokes risks of constrained liquidity conditions with the possibility of an adverse economic shock. For this reason, analysts warn that the second half of 2023 may see excess volatility.\n\nBackdoor liquidity injections negate the Fed\u2019s quantitative tightening\n\nThe Fed started its quantitative tightening in April by increasing the interest rates on its borrowings. The aim was to reduce inflation by constraining the market's liquidity. Its balance sheet shrank by $476 billion during this period, which is a positive sign considering that inflation dropped and employment levels stayed healthy.\n\nU.S. Fed Balance sheet. Source: U.S. Federal Reserve\n\nHowever, during the same time, the U.S. Treasury used its Treasury General Account (TGA) to inject liquidity into the market. Typically, the Treasury would sell bonds to raise additional cash to meet its obligations. However, since the nation\u2019s debt was close to its debt ceiling level, the federal department used its cash to fund the deficit.\n\nU.S. Treasury General Account Balance. Source: MacroMicro\n\nEffectively, it\u2019s a backdoor liquidity injection. The TGA is a net liability of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. The Treasury had drained $542 million from its TGA account since April 2022, when the Fed began rate hikes. Independent macro market analyst Lyn Alden told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cU.S. Treasury is drawing down its cash balance to avoid going over the debt ceiling, which is adding liquidity into the system. So, the Treasury has been offsetting some of the QT that the Fed is doing. Once the debt ceiling issue gets resolved, the Treasury will be refilling its cash account, which pulls liquidity out of the system.\u201d\n\nDebt ceiling issue and potential economic fallout\n\nThe U.S. Treasury\u2019s debt totaled approximately $31.45 trillion as of Jan. 23. The number represents the total outstanding of the U.S. government accumulated over the nation\u2019s history. It is crucial because it has reached the Treasury\u2019s debt ceiling.\n\nThe debt ceiling is an arbitrary number set by the U.S. government that limits the amount of Treasury bonds sold to the Federal Reserve. Hitting it means that the government can no longer take on additional debts.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. has to pay interest on its national debt of $31.4 trillion and spend on the welfare and development of the country. These expenditures include salaries of public medical practitioners, educational institutions and pension beneficiaries.\n\nNeedless to say, the U.S. government spends more than it makes. Thus, if it can\u2019t raise debt, there\u2019ll have to be a cut in either interest rate payments or government expenditures. The first scenario means a default in U.S. government bonds, which opens a big can of worms, starting with a loss of trust in the world\u2019s largest economy. The second scenario poses uncertain but real risks as failure to meet public goods payment can induce political instability in the country.\n\nBut, the limit is not set in stone; the U.S. Congress votes on the debt ceiling and has changed it many times. The U.S. Treasury Department notes that \u201csince 1960, Congress has acted 78 separate times to permanently raise, temporarily extend, or revise the definition of the debt limit \u2014 49 times under Republican presidents and 29 times under Democratic presidents.\u201d\n\nIf history is any indication, lawmakers are more likely to resolve those issues by raising the debt ceiling before any real damage is done. However, in that case, the Treasury would be inclined to increase its TGA balance again; the department\u2019s target is $700 billion by 2023 end.\n\nEither by draining out its liquidity completely by June or with the help of a debt ceiling amendment, the backdoor liquidity injections into the economy would come to a close. It threatens to create a challenging situation for risk-on assets.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s correlation with stock markets remains strong\n\nBitcoin\u2019s correlation with the U.S. stock market indexes, especially the Nasdaq 100, remains near all-time highs. Alden noted that FTX\u2019s collapse suppressed the crypto market in Q4 2022 when the equities rallied on slower rate hike expectations. And while Congress delays its decision on the debt ceiling, favorable liquidity conditions have allowed Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise.\n\nBTC/USD price chart with Bitcoin-Nasdaq correlation coefficient. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, the correlation with the stock markets is still strong, and movements in S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 will likely continue influencing Bitcoin\u2019s price. Nik Bhatia, a financial researcher, wrote about the importance of the stock market\u2019s direction for Bitcoin. He said,\n\n\u201c\u2026in the short term, market prices can be very wrong. But over the more intermediate term, we have to take trends and trend reversals seriously.\u201d\n\nWith the risks from the ongoing Fed\u2019s quantitative tightening and stoppage of Treasury liquidity injections, the markets are expected to stay vulnerable through the second half of 2023.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "$1.48B in Bitcoin options expire on Friday \u2014 Will BTC hold $22K? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price faced fierce resistance at $23,000 after an 11% rally on Jan. 20, but that was enough to cause $335 million in liquidations for short positions using futures contracts. The 36% year-to-date gain to $22,500 caused bears to be ill-prepared for the $1.48 billion monthly options expiry on Jan. 27.\n\nBitcoin investor sentiment improved after signals pointing to lower inflationary pressure suggested that the U.S. Federal Reserve could soon move away from its interest rate increase and quantitative tightening. Commonly known as a pivot, the trend change would benefit risk assets such as cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn Jan. 22, the China-based peer-to-peer trades of USD Coin (USDC) reached a 3.5% premium versus the United States dollar, indicating moderate FOMO by retail traders. This level is the highest in more than six months, suggesting excessive cryptocurrency buying demand has pressured the indicator above fair value.\n\nThe all-time high on the seven-day Bitcoin hash rate \u2014 an estimate of processing power dedicated to mining \u2014 also supported the bullish momentum. The indicator peaked at 276.9 exo-hash per second (EH/s) on Jan. 19, signaling a reversion of the recent weakness caused by miners facing financial difficulties.\n\nDespite the bears\u2019 best efforts, Bitcoin has been trading above $20,000 since Jan. 14 \u2014 a movement that explains why the $1.48 billion Bitcoin monthly options expiry will vastly benefit bulls despite the recent failure to break the $23,200 resistance.\n\nBulls were too optimistic, but remain well positioned\n\nBitcoin\u2019s latest rally on Jan. 20 caught bears by surprise, as a mere 6% of the put (sell) options for the monthly expiry have been placed above $22,000. Thus, bulls are better positioned even though they set nearly 40% of their call (buy) options at $23,000 or higher.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for Nov. 25. Source: CoinGlass\n\nA broader view using the 1.15 call-to-put ratio shows more bullish bets because the call (buy) open interest stands at $790 million against the $680 million put (sell) options. Nevertheless, most bearish bets will likely become worthless as Bitcoin is up 36% in January.\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s price remains above $22,000 at 8:00 am UTC on Jan. 27, only $38 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference happens because there is no use in the right to sell Bitcoin at $21,000 or $22,000 if it trades higher on expiry.\n\nBears could secure a $595 million profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Jan. 27 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $20,000 and $21,000: 12,800 calls vs. 7,100 puts. The net result favors bulls by $115 million.\n\n12,800 calls vs. 7,100 puts. The net result favors bulls by $115 million. Between $21,000 and $22,000: 17,600 calls vs. 2,800 puts. The net result favors bulls by $320 million.\n\n17,600 calls vs. 2,800 puts. The net result favors bulls by $320 million. Between $22,000 and $23,000: 21,200 calls vs. 1,100 puts. Bulls remain in control, profiting $455 million.\n\n21,200 calls vs. 1,100 puts. Bulls remain in control, profiting $455 million. Between $23,000 and $24,000: 25,300 calls vs. 0 puts. Bulls completely dominate the expiry, racking up $595 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin due for shake-up vs. gold, stocks as BTC price dips under $22.5K\n\nBitcoin bears need to push the price below $21,000 on Jan. 27 to greatly reduce their losses. However, Bitcoin bears recently had $335 million worth of liquidated leveraged short futures positions, so they likely have less margin required to exert power in the short term.\n\nConsequently, the most probable scenario for the January monthly BTC options expiry is the $22,000 or higher level, providing a decent win for bulls.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Six on-chain metrics suggesting Bitcoin is a 'generational buying opportunity' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Several on-chain metrics from the Bitcoin (BTC) network are flashing buy signals following this year\u2019s rally.\n\nBitcoin has broken out of its torpor to notch up a 37% gain since the beginning of 2023. However, on-chain data is still signaling it could be a \u201cgenerational buying opportunity,\u201d according to analysts.\n\nOn Jan. 24, researcher and technical analyst \u201cGame of Trades\u201d identified six on-chain metrics for his 71,000 Twitter followers.\n\nThe first metric is an accumulation trend score highlighting zones of heavy accumulation in terms of entity size and the number of coins bought.\n\n\u201cLarge entities have been in deep accumulation mode ever since the FTX collapse,\u201d the analyst noted, adding that \u201csimilar accumulation took place in the 2018 and 2020 bottoms.\u201d\n\nBitcoin: 6 on-chain metrics calling for a generational long-term buying opportunity\n\n\n\nA thread \u2014 Game of Trades (@GameofTrades_) January 23, 2023\n\nThe Bitcoin entity-adjusted dormancy flow is a measure of the ratio of the current market capitalization and the annualized dormancy value.\n\nWhenever dormancy value overtakes market capitalization, the market can be considered in full capitulation which has been a good historical buying zone.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, this metric fell to its lowest level ever in 2022.\n\nBTC entity- adjusted dormancy flow. Image: Glassnode\n\nBitcoin\u2019s reserve risk can be used to measure the confidence of long-term holders relative to the price of BTC. This also fell to its lowest-ever level at the end of 2022, according to Glassnode data.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Realized Price (RP) is the value of all coins in circulation at the price they last moved \u2014 in other words, an estimation of what the entire market paid for their coins.\n\nAccording to Woo Charts, Bitcoin has been trading below this level since FTX\u2019s collapse in November until Jan. 13. It is currently just above the RP, which represents another buying opportunity.\n\nThe Bitcoin MVRV Z-score shows when BTC is significantly over or undervalued relative to its \u201cfair value\u201d or realized price. When the metric leaves the extremely undervalued zone it is often considered the end of the bear market.\n\nBTC\u2019s MVRV Z-Score.

        "title": "Film review: 'Human B' shows a personal journey with Bitcoin - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The human side of Bitcoin (BTC) is seldom explored in legacy or mainstream crypto media outlets. Even within the Bitcoin space, Bitcoin is \u201cnumber goes up\u201d technology, while catchphrases like \u201cBitcoin to the moon\u201d and \u201chave fun staying poor\u201d rattle around like coins in a jar.\n\nBitcoin documentaries tend to sensationalize Bitcoin as a panacea to the world\u2019s problems instead of offering nuanced portrayals of Bitcoin\u2019s impact on the individuals who form the decentralized movement.\n\nMoreover, while the price per Bitcoin has inflated, ballooned and popped over the past five years, a steady stream of new people is flowing into the Bitcoin space. Human B follows the journey of a man named Jan as he becomes a resolute Bitcoin believer. The film hovers around Jan, the \u201cnormal citizen\u201d who, during a break between jobs, starts to learn more about fiat, or government-issued, money.\n\nJan was an editor and musician prior to his journey into Bitcoin.\n\nIn the film, Jan explains that fiat money is \u201cbad\u201d because it\u2019s limitless. Fiat money is designed to lose its purchasing power over time.\n\n\u201cI was extremely irritated at first because I thought, how is this possible? Why am I just casually discovering this while all the experts are wrong?\u201d\n\nThe epiphany sends him spiraling down the proverbial Bitcoin rabbit hole, and he sets off on a journey to Miami, Florida. \u201cI\u2019m not the first to run into a crowd,\u201d he concedes, but \u201cI feel that this is about something really crucial.\u201d\n\nRecent: Amid crypto winter, central banks rethink in-house digital currencies\n\nThe film also interviews a number of key figures in the industry, including Marc Friedrich, a best-selling German author; Alessandro Ceceres, a Venezuelan who is now marketing manager at Luxor; and Anita Posch, a Bitcoin activist. These interviews provide valuable insights into the motivations and goals of the people driving growth in the Bitcoin economy, as well as their thoughts on the future of this emerging technology.\n\nAn artsy, nuanced take that avoids clich\u00e9, lazy pop culture memes and slapdash cutaways to soundbites of Michael Saylor, Max Keiser or Jack Mallers, directors Aaron Mucke and Eva M\u00fchlenb\u00e4umer take a soft approach to the story arc. At a gentle rhythm, the story uses wit, character and charisma to give life to Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s invention.\n\nPierre Corbin, a Bitcoin consultant and documentary maker shared his opinion on Human B with Cointelegraph: \u201cI liked how the beginning shows the Bitcoin culture and the passion of the people working in the space, all while being intellectuals. It is shown for newbies that are not maxis and understand the Bitcoin pop culture. I could show it to my family and maybe they would finally understand why I am obsessed.\u201d\n\nAmong the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, the film takes the viewer from Germany to Austria to Mexico and, finally, to Miami, where El Salvador's Bitcoin Law is first announced. And while the film\u2019s focus is on protagonist Jan, who slowly plans, then executes, his trip to Miami\u2019s Bitcoin 2021 Conference. The documentary collates quirky interviews with well-known German Bitcoiners.\n\nGigi, a pseudonymous household name among Bitcoin circles, stars as a giggly, eccentric man dressed in a greenscreen suit. To those new to Bitcoin, Gigi is a software engineer and Bitcoin author whose true identity is not known.\n\nGigi in his element.\n\nHe bounces around an art studio, explaining complex Bitcoin concepts with graffiti. The German paints Bitcoin equations onto white walls while sporting a chroma-key bodysuit, sunglasses fit for a Matrix remake and over-ear headphones. He chuckles away to the viewer, explaining that Bitcoin employs \u201cmeme warfare.\u201d\n\nGigi sits on a Matrix chair, taking the viewer through \"meme warfare.\"\n\nElsewhere, a relaxed Anita Posch \u2014 another German-speaking Bitcoin educator \u2014 details her love of Bitcoin\u2019s use in Africa. She narrates personal stories while the camera follows her cycle through rolling Austrian hills, such as the story behind the Bitcoin tattoo on her wrist. She explains that the thunderbolt\u2013a nod to the Lightning Network\u2013stands for \u201cenergy,\u201d when asked by those who haven\u2019t understood Bitcoin yet.\n\nRecent: Going cashless: Norway's digital currency project raises privacy questions\n\nThe tattoo scene is a neat hint at one of the film\u2019s underlying messages: Bitcoin is misunderstood. Rooted under the headlines, the mudslinging and the memes that dominate the Bitcoin space, the profound impact of Bitcoin on human lives is slowly bearing fruit. From Senegal to El Salvador, Switzerland to Indonesia, stories of how Bitcoin has changed lives for the better are gracing the world \u2014 but those stories live underneath the headlines.\n\nPosch cycles through central Europe.\n\nSupport and analysis from mainstream reporter Friedemann Brenneis fleshes out further details on why Bitcoin is so misunderstood. He pins media headlines to a board, demonstrating that, contrary to popular reports that Bitcoin is dead, there\u2019s \u201cmore to it than the media reports.\u201d\n\nBrenneis takes stock of mainstream media narratives.\n\nAs Corbin told Cointelegraph, Human B is the sort of documentary that you could show to friends or family who are not sold on Bitcoin and they might finally get it. Plus, the animations and narrative details are well-crafted yet instructive. Corbin highlighted one of these creative touches: \u201cFor example, when the fiat monetary system is explained and the banker gives out the loans by pressing \u2018Enter\u2019 repeatedly.\u201d\n\nIn all, amid a sea of Bitcoin documentaries that, at times, feel like propaganda or clarion calls for greater Bitcoin adoption, Human B is a thoughtful, personal account. It recently hit 250,000 views on YouTube and is also available on Vimeo.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "title": "Top 10 Bitcoin Alternatives One Must Consider in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Here are 10 bitcoin alternatives that have held on throughout steep price climbs and plunges\n\nBitcoin is a synonym for cryptocurrency. It is single-handedly leading the pack of cryptocurrencies in terms of popularity and market capitalization. But there are many Bitcoin alternatives like Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Cardano, Binance Coin, and more that can be strong options for diversifying your crypto portfolio. In the ocean of 20,000+ cryptocurrencies, let\u2019s check out the top 10 Bitcoin alternatives you must consider before your next investment:\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is Bitcoin\u2019s largest competitor. Being the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, it\u2019s also the biggest platform for decentralized applications. The applications on Ethereum are run on ether, its platform-specific cryptographic token. Bitcoin is primarily a store of value and medium of exchange; Ethereum is seen as a general-purpose blockchain.\n\nBitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash has marked a milestone as one of the first altcoins that emerged and successfully traded off from bitcoin. The cryptocurrency emerged as a solution to the unsettling issues between bitcoin developers and miners. Bitcoin Cash got split from bitcoin\u2019s chain and created its own path towards adoption and growing market capitalization.\n\nShiba Inu\n\nShiba Inu is one of the most popular meme coins with a large and active community. Being a deflationary cryptocurrency, it can be good for long-term value growth. At present, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001212, with a 24-hour trading volume of $389,319,671.\n\nDogecoin\n\nOften called a \u2018meme coin,\u2019 dogecoin is the first cryptocurrency that came out from the Shiba Inu joke that trended on the internet years back. After maintaining a low profile for many since its inception in 2013, dogecoin showed its potential in 2020 when it was accepted as a payment model among sports teams and entered the AMC theaters.\n\nSolana\n\nSoaring by more than 11,000% throughout 2021, Solana created history. Although it is trading below its all-time high of $260 in 2022, Solana has outperformed the majority of other cryptocurrencies, which makes it one of the top 10 Bitcoin alternatives.\n\nTether\n\nTehter is born out as the brainchild of people who thought that the cryptocurrency market was very volatile and unsettling. As the foremost stable coin, the tether is pegged to the US dollar and experiences fewer fluctuations compared to bitcoin. This alone makes the cryptocurrency the best alternative for bitcoin.\n\nRipple\n\nRipple Network is a network that has been developed to provide quick and secure transactions to banks, especially by using blockchain technology. The Ripple system scores better than the bitcoin network for its lower processing times and lower transaction charges.\n\nBinance Coin\n\nBNB is the cryptocurrency promoted by Binance Coin exchange. Unlike bitcoin that just acts as a cryptocurrency, Binance Coin is both a virtual token and a crypto exchange platform that could pump up value based on its market performance. Besides, the platform also incentivizes users with BNB coins over transactions, enhancing the circulation of the token as much as possible.\n\nCardano\n\nCardano is one of the most fundamentally strong and best Bitcoin alternatives in the market today. With low transaction fees and continued developments in Cardano\u2019s ecosystem, the coin does have an advantage over both Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nLitecoin\n\nReferred as the \u2018silver to bitcoin\u2019s gold,\u2019 Litecoin was launched in 2011 with much of its functionalities similar to bitcoin. Litecoin was created by an MIT graduate and former Google engineer, Charlie Lee. With an open-source global payment network, Litecoin can add faster blocks compared to bitcoin, which contributes to its faster transaction time.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "KEARNEY, Neb. (Flatwater Free Press) - On an 11-acre plot in Kearney sit dozens of what look like shipping containers.\n\nInside the metal boxes are racks and racks of computers. Thousands of them, solving complicated math equations \u2018round the clock.\n\nHere on the outskirts of town, wedged between a solar field and a corn field, the thousands of computers mine for cryptocurrency.\n\nTogether, they use as much electricity as the entire city of Kearney, pop. 33,790, to do it.\n\nThis is one of the largest cryptocurrency data centers in Nebraska \u2013 a host site for the computers racing to verify crypto transactions and add to the digital currency.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely the first of many such centers to set up shop in the state, as the still new and oft-volatile crypto industry carves out a home in rural America.\n\nNebraska's Electricity Rates (Graphic by Hanscom Park Studio)\n\nThe instability of crypto has already hit the Kearney location \u2013 in September, Compute North, the company that opened the data center, declared bankruptcy. The Kearney property was sold to Generate Capital, one of the company\u2019s lenders.\n\nBut even freefalling crypto prices, the infamous failure of crypto exchange FTX and the arrest of its co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried haven\u2019t stopped the industry\u2019s expansion in Nebraska.\n\nJust last week, the Hall County Board of Commissioners approved the construction of a 14-megawatt crypto data center near Grand Island.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t actively pursuing these, they came to us,\u201d said Neal Niedfeldt, chief executive officer of Southern Public Power District, one of many Nebraska utility districts fielding crypto company calls in recent years.\n\nA digital currency, crypto relies on a network of computers maintaining a blockchain \u2013 think of it like a digital ledger of transactions. The computers solve complicated math problems to verify transactions and add them to the ledger. In exchange, they receive digital \u201ccoins\u201d \u2013 like bitcoin or ethereum \u2013 along the way.\n\nThe currency is largely unregulated and not tied to banks. It\u2019s not backed by any government, like the U.S. dollar or the British pound. For crypto enthusiasts, the decentralized structure is part of the appeal.\n\n\u201cBasically, the business of crypto is converting electricity into computer computations,\u201d said Gus Hurwitz, a law professor at the University of Nebraska College of Law.\n\nBusinesses like Compute North in Kearney function as a rental space for the computers making it all run. Crypto miners ship in their equipment, paying for space, maintenance, internet and \u2013 crucially \u2013 electricity.\n\nWith computers running virtually 24/7, and fans running to cool them, electricity is the main cost of doing business. The companies running these hubs need power. They\u2019re looking for it cheap.\n\nAbout five years ago, Compute North found it in Nebraska \u2013 the only state served entirely by publicly owned utilities mandated to deliver the cheapest electricity possible.\n\n\u201cThey had heard our rates are low, and they\u2019re stable,\u201d said Nicole Sedlacek, economic development manager for NPPD. \u201cThat ultimately led them to put in a phone call to us.\u201d\n\nThe company had a few other criteria: They liked the power district\u2019s mix of carbon-free energy. They needed affordable land. They sought a place with the capacity to handle their massive electrical load, and a local government open to the idea of crypto coming to town.\n\nKearney had everything they were looking for.\n\nThe central Nebraska town had already been trying to develop its technology park. It was in the running for a Facebook data center, but lost the bid to Altoona, Iowa, about a decade ago.\n\nA crypto data center promised jobs, but not in a way that would strain housing or take workers from employers already in town, said Stan Clouse, mayor for 20 years.\n\nClouse is also an NPPD account manager. He spent the first meeting with Compute North asking about their energy needs. What the mayor heard excited him, he said.\n\nNPPD had enough electrical capacity to handle the data center, and wouldn\u2019t need to generate more power specifically for Compute North. The data center would double the electrical capacity of Kearney\u2019s power grid, making power more stable and keeping rates low. It would also mean an influx of cash.\n\n\u201cIncreasing the load increases revenue, which goes into the Kearney general fund,\u201d Clouse said. \u201cThat\u2019s an excess of $1 million annually to Kearney. For a community our size, that\u2019s pretty significant.\u201d\n\nBut for some, the Kearney data center, and others soon to be running in Grand Island and York, aren\u2019t to be celebrated. They\u2019re a cause for concern.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about job creation and opportunity for Nebraska,\u201d said Scott Scholz, a spokesperson for the newly formed advocacy group Nebraskans for Social Good. \u201cIt\u2019s about out-of-state companies leveraging our electrical system for their own profit.\u201d\n\nSave for Clouse, who abstained because of his utility role, the Kearney City Council voted unanimously in June 2019 to approve a development agreement with Compute North.\n\nThe company received 11 acres of free land, valued at $165,000 and paid for by the Economic Development Council of Buffalo County. The city gave the company a rebate on electricity, capped at $1.1 million. The company hit that cap in August.\n\nThen-Lt. Gov. Mike Foley, NPPD President and CEO Pat Pope, and Kearney Mayor Stan Clouse (left to right) watch as former Compute North President and CEO Dave Perrill speaks at the August 2019 groundbreaking of the Kearney crypto data center. Since then, the data center has changed hands after Compute North declared bankruptcy in September 2022. (Economic Development Council of Buffalo County)\n\nNebraska Public Power added mobile substations to help accommodate the increased load. The utility district is working on a new $12.5 million permanent substation that will exclusively transmit energy to the crypto-mining location.\n\nIn return, Compute North promised jobs, and delivered 11. It helped develop and add to the electrical capacity of Kearney\u2019s tech park. By 2021, it grew to be a 100-megawatt customer.\n\nBy comparison: The entire city\u2019s energy needs peak at 100 megawatts. The second largest user in Kearney is the manufacturing company Eaton, peaking at 10 megawatts, Clouse said.\n\nThe data center\u2019s load is enormous and consistent \u2013 it doesn\u2019t fluctuate through the day like the energy usage in a home or factory, said Pat Hanrahan, NPPD\u2019s general manager of retail services. And it\u2019s flexible. If NPPD needs more power from the grid to heat homes during a cold winter, for example, the data center can easily pause.\n\nBut the huge amount of electricity usage raises environmental concerns, Scholz said.\n\nOne year of global mining for cryptocurrency uses more electricity than the country of Argentina, according to an estimate in a White House report on crypto and climate change \u2013 as much as nearly 1% of the world\u2019s annual electricity usage.\n\nIn New York, lawmakers recently passed a two-year ban on fossil fuel-powered crypto mining projects. In Montana, a coal-fired power plant was set to shut down, cheering environmentalists \u2013 until a crypto data center opened nearby.\n\nIn Nebraska, NPPD already had the energy capacity to power the Kearney data center, Hanrahan said. The public utility didn\u2019t need to build new power generation to supply it.\n\nRoughly 62% of NPPD\u2019s energy generation is carbon-free, a number that remained steady before and after Compute North came to Kearney, said Grant Otten, NPPD spokesperson.\n\nStill, a data center\u2019s constant energy usage is likely to draw from all available energy sources, said Bruce Dvorak, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln civil engineering professor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming from a mix of more green sources, like wind, as well as not-so-green sources, like coal and natural gas,\u201d Dvorak said.\n\nOver the past five years, NPPD\u2019s economic development arm has fielded calls from about 25 different crypto companies interested in Nebraska, Sedlacek said. The calls increased when China banned crypto in 2021.\n\nSome towns, like Kearney, were open to the idea, Sedlacek said. Others have been more hesitant. They welcomed economic development.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t want crypto,\u201d they told her.\n\nThe crypto market is young, widely unfamiliar to the general public and wildly speculative and volatile. In November 2021, the price of bitcoin peaked at $68,764. Since then, it\u2019s crashed by 75%, plunging to $16,625 in January.\n\nIn November, the crypto exchange company FTX filed for bankruptcy, shaking the already fraught industry. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was then arrested for multiple counts of fraud, sowing more distrust among crypto skeptics.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely at a low point in the industry right now,\u201d said Hurwitz, the law professor. \u201cIt\u2019s possible we could get lower. Anyone entering into this market right now needs to be better capitalized, and capitalized in a less risky way than they likely were a year ago.\u201d\n\nCompute North, the company that opened Kearney\u2019s data center, declared bankruptcy late last year, citing rising energy costs and profits that couldn\u2019t keep pace as bitcoin value plummeted. The bankruptcy didn\u2019t interrupt local operations. Today, the cluster of computers between a cornfield and a solar field continue verifying transactions and mining new cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cBecause they can move in so quickly, they can move out rather quickly, too,\u201d said Sedlacek, the NPPD economic development manager. \u201cWe spent a lot of time as a utility really talking through that. How can we protect our ratepayers so we aren\u2019t left stranded with assets and unpaid bills?\u201d\n\nShe thought the calls would slow last year, when the digital currencies cratered. But the companies kept calling.\n\nA handful of other projects are now in the works in Nebraska.\n\nThe York City Council decided in April to sell land to BginUSA, an Omaha company wanting to build an $8 million mining complex. In Minden, an expansion Compute North had planned is in the process of being transferred to New York-based Foundry Digital.\n\nIn November, a group of residents opposed to a proposed crypto data center near Doniphan crowded a Hall County Commissioners public hearing.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a farm facility going in,\u201d resident Justin Gregg said during public comment, according to NTV News. \u201cWe grew up around a corn field. It\u2019s all corn fields around us, and should stay that way.\u201d\n\nThe interested company pulled its request for a conditional use permit before the commissioners voted.\n\nThis week, Hall County approved a conditional use permit for a different crypto project near Grand Island.\n\nQuestions loom around cryptocurrency\u2019s future, including possible regulation and market prices. Last year, the Biden Administration released recommendations on future U.S. regulation.\n\nNebraska towns and utility districts now hopefully fully understand the risks they might face with crypto companies, Hurwitz said.\n\n\u201cCompanies, municipalities, investors, bankers, lenders \u2013 anyone who was willing to fund things \u2013 is going to be doing so with much more awareness of the risks,\u201d he said. \u201cI would not be willing to take anything on credit.\u201d\n\nWith crypto\u2019s future uncertain, Sedlacek asks companies who call NPPD: What do you see this looking like in the future? And what happens if crypto goes away?\n\nMany have told her they may eventually pivot their mass computer power to other industries, maybe banking, finance or health care.\n\n\u201cThey really say that cryptocurrency is really their first step into this high-computing space,\u201d Sedlacek said.\n\nCopyright 2023 KOLN.

        "content": "Vivek Ramaswamy is an entrepreneur and author. In this interview, we discuss his thesis that social and political struggles are rooted in the rise of a managerial class dominating society at the expense of everyday citizens. We also talk about the need to revive a binding national identity, and how the social justice movement may be causing more harm than good.\n\n- - - -\n\nPublic choice theory influenced a generation of conservatives around the world in the 1970s and 80s. In essence, the theory applied economic thinking to political behaviour. It undermined the notion of public interest: it was a nebulous irrelevance in relation to public policy as all individuals, including politicians and bureaucrats, work in their own self-interest.\n\nWhat resulted was the development of a managerial class that would be incentivized to achieve specific aims through monetary rewards. This class has grown since the 1980s to now represent, in some people\u2019s views, an oversized controlling force within society. However, their decision-making is increasingly outside of the purview and influence of ordinary citizens.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy believes this friction between managers and everyday people is at the root of the current social and political struggles within society. Exacerbating these tensions are increasing incidents of managers being coopted by elites to do their bidding, undermining constitutional norms. Vivek believes that we are now at a defining moment when the defining principles of political organisation need to be reviewed.\n\nThe ideals and principles of the United States, as laid out in the constitution, became a unifying force around which a vibrant national identity was developed. This, until very recently, facilitated and supported American hegemony. But, in short order, that binding sense of a united vision has been replaced by factionalised ideologies that threaten the viability of the American experiment.\n\nThe fundamental issue is that the notion of Americanism has been allowed to wither. Vivek believes that to combat China and meet the other great challenges of our age, America must find again a shared national identity that eclipses current partisan divisions. In essence, the US must retrace its steps before venturing forward."

        "content": "The U.K. government\u2019s economic and finance ministry, His Majesty\u2019s Treasury, is recruiting for a head of central bank digital currency (CBDC) to lead the development of a digital pound. The work is described as \u201cimportant, complex, and cross-cutting\u201d and will \u201crequire extensive engagement across and beyond the HM Treasury.\u201d\n\nAccording to the LinkedIn post, the Treasury and the Bank of England are working together through the CBDC Taskforce to explore the case for a digital pound. The role of the head of CBDC may bring the United Kingdom\u2019s government closer to its aim of rolling out a CBDC.\n\nHM Treasury\u2019s job posting for a CBDC head. Source: LinkedIn\n\nDanny Scott, CEO of U.K.-based Bitcoin (BTC) company CoinCorner, told Cointelegraph that a CBDC could be missing the \u201cactual real-world use and purpose, which is what we often see.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor those that have been in the industry for a cycle or two, we\u2019ve seen the hypes come and go \u2014 altcoins, blockchain, distributed ledger, ICOs, DeFi, NFTs. You see large companies come along and jump on the latest hype to avoid looking like they\u2019re falling behind. It falls under R&D and exploratory for most, which is perfectly understandable.\u201d\n\nScott, who has been working and building in the Bitcoin space for over a decade, explained that sometimes, the public could misinterpret the research and development projects in the crypto space and perhaps confuse them with useful real-world solutions.\n\n\u201cA CBDC [digital pound] doesn\u2019t fall far from this. Many countries around the world are exploring this and trying to understand the benefits of this over the current system \u2014 fair enough, this will happen.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the move toward a digital pound matches the trend among central banks worldwide to explore the potential of CBDCs. In Europe, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been actively studying the future of a digital euro, and several countries, including Sweden and Denmark, are also exploring their own digital currencies.\n\nCBDCs claim to offer a number of benefits, including improved financial inclusion, reduced costs for businesses and consumers, and increased security and efficiency in the payment system.\n\nHowever, El Salvador banked as much as 70% of its unbanked population with the introduction of Bitcoin as legal tender, while countries such as Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya can now receive money from around the world to a mobile phone or Bitcoin exchange account.\n\nPaying for coffee in El Salvador using Bitcoin. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nMoreover, there are potential risks to introducing a new digital currency. James Dewar, partner at U.K. Bitcoin merchant solution Bridge2Bitcoin and a director at Laser Eyes Cards, told Cointelegraph that the \u201cintroduction of a CBDC would itself present different challenges and risks than Bitcoin,\u201d as the CBDC requires \u201ctrust in third parties, central banks and governments, to not abuse the supply of the currency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis risk applies at the macro level as it does today, but more worryingly with a CBDC on the ability for a government or its agencies to monitor and censor individual spending. This is a huge risk for the rights of freedom and property ownership within our societies.\u201d\n\nHe raises the question, \u201cWhilst we may trust one government or another, do we as citizens trust all future governments, of whatever color, with this power?\u201d Tony Yates, a former senior adviser to the Bank of England, has spoken out against CBDCs. Resonating Dewar\u2019s thoughts, he questioned the motivations behind the global rollouts of CBDCs, calling them \u201csuspect.\u201d\n\nDewar continued, \u201cIt is reasonable that government explore the idea properly. Overall, we worry that there may be political pressure brought to the process that ignores or significantly downplays the risks to society of a CBDC.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cdigital\u201d aspect of money is also brought into question. The U.K. is increasingly a digital cash-based society: Less than 15% of payments are made with physical cash according to the Bank of England, and as many as 23 million people \u2014 about one-third of the U.K. population \u2014 did not use cash at all in 2021.\n\nCointelegraph reporter Joe Hall races contactless payments, Bitcoin vs. pounds sterling in Gibraltar. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nScott asks of the treasury, \u201cDon\u2019t we already have a digital pound?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom an end-consumer perspective, the pound is mostly digital these days regardless of the mechanism used. So, once they have finished their exploratory stages, I would love to see a list of the benefits and new features a CBDC will bring to the public.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Scott will \u201ccontinue to focus on Bitcoin and making a global, interoperable system everyone can participate in.\u201d\n\nRelated: Amid crypto winter, central banks rethink in-house digital currencies\n\nDewar shared that there could be hope for Bitcoin and the U.K. government: \u201cThe role description notes that the emergence of private sector money \u2014 such as Bitcoin \u2014 offers exciting opportunities for U.K. businesses and consumers, and we would very much agree with that at Bridge2Bitcoin.\u201d The Bank of England CBDC, by design, will be available to Brits, although no official timeline is set."

        "content": "For the first time since November 7, 2022, flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, showed some signs of recovery. The cryptocurrency, which traded below $17,000 since the FTX issue, rose above $21,000 on Thursday, January 14, 2023.\n\nAs expected, traders, investors, and enthusiasts were excited to see the little ray of sunshine even though it is a far cry from the $68,000 price the cryptocurrency crashed from.\n\nThe value of the entire crypto market rose to $990 million, rising \u223c19% from $831 million in November 2022.\n\nCrypto influencer and full-time trader, Ademi, said the rise is likely due to a reduced supply of bitcoin and ethereum in the market. CNBC corroborated Ademi\u2019s stance, saying there\u2019s been a huge buyup of the cryptocurrency by large buyers known as whales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Ademi, the current rise in the price of bitcoin is a breath of fresh air after a long crypto winter. While she\u2019s optimistic about prices rising further, she admits there\u2019s no telling if this is the beginning of another bull run or a brief moment of happiness for traders like her.\n\nBitcoin price in the last month. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nGreen strokes on the crypto chart could be a sign to get into the market and make some profit. However, there\u2019s a need to understand why the market is on the rise and if it is sustainable.\n\nHere are two things you should know before you invest in crypto\n\nWhy is the crypto market on the rise?\n\nAccording to Micheal Ugwu, angel investor CEO of FreeMe Digital, bitcoin is on the rise because economic metrics in the US weren\u2019t as bad as it was expected to be. For example, the inflation rate dropped from 7.10% to 6.5%, making traders optimistic that interest rates would drop.\n\nIn the past, Bitcoin was one way to hedge against inflation, but it didn\u2019t do that in 2022. The cryptocurrency is behaving similar to the stock market playing to the tunes of micro and macroeconomic factors.\n\nBe the smartest in the room Join 30,000 subscribers who receive Techpoint Digest, a fun week-daily 5-minute roundup of happenings in African and global tech, directly in your inbox, hours before everyone else. Digest Subscription Email First Name Subscribe Give it a try, you can unsubscribe anytime. Privacy Policy.\n\nThe rise has also been attributed to the activities of whales. These are people or entities that purchase large quantities of cryptocurrencies enough to move the market.\n\nAccording to crypto data firm Kaiko, trade sizes have gone from an average of $700 to $1,100 on Binance.\n\nMicheal Saylor, CEO of Microstrategy, is a well-known crypto whale who bought $45 million worth of Bitcoin in December 2022. When whales sweep up cryptocurrencies in large volumes, it reduces the supply of crypto, which leads to an increase in prices.\n\nThe third reason for the hike in the price of bitcoin is the increasing mining difficulty. BTC.com data revealed that mining difficulty is now at 37.6 trillion, which means it will take 37.6 trillion attempts to find a valid bitcoin block and add it to the blockchain.\n\nImage by jcomp on Freepik\n\nMetrics such as these make the cryptocurrency harder to mine, increasing its scarcity and price.\n\nWill the factors affecting the rise of bitcoin stay the same?\n\nWhile some economic factors are panning out well for bitcoin, it doesn't mean things will stay the same. According to Ugwu, the economic situation in the US doesn\u2019t change the macro economic conditions, which will affect crypto in the long run.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the global economy is projected to grow by 1.7% in 2023, a sharp downturn in growth. Judging by what happened in 2022, this figure could be worse than the World Bank's prediction.\n\nOn January 10, 2022, the World Bank warned that the global economy was \"perilously close to falling into recession.\"\n\nEven worse, the recession the World Bank envisions is going to be broad-based, with everyone everywhere in the world experiencing a significant slowdown in their earnings.\n\nThese are the macro economic factors that make Ugwu believe the hike in bitcoin price is going to be short-lived.\n\nHe said, \"everything is pumping, and I don't mind; all I know is that it's most likely short-term.\"\n\nWhile the crypto whales might sweep up enough coins to drive up prices, economic conditions across the world do not bode well for the crypto market. History, however, shows that when it comes to crypto, there\u2019s no telling what will happen."

It was initially filed last year on May 13, a month after Ark\u2019s first attempt to list the product on BZX was turned down.\n\nAn ETF\u2014short for \u201cexchange-traded fund\u201d\u2014is an investment vehicle offering indirect exposure to an underlying asset. This can be useful for investing in items that are difficult to own and store by oneself, such as gold, or for many, cryptocurrency.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s rationale for the decision is the same as last time: Ark has failed to demonstrate that the rules of its exchange are adequate to protect the investing public from \u201cfraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\u201d\n\nGrayscale: SEC Argument for Blocking Bitcoin Spot ETF 'Illogical'\n\n\u201cAn exchange that lists bitcoin-based ETPs can meet its obligations under Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5) by demonstrating that the exchange has a comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to the underlying or reference bitcoin assets,\u201d explained the SEC in its rejection.\n\nETFs would also give institutions a green light to effectively buy Bitcoin when they are otherwise barred from doing so by internal charter. This has made crypto bulls thirsty for such a product to hit the U.S. market\u2014but so far, no dice.\n\nProShares Launches First ETF to Short Bitcoin\n\nBy contrast, the SEC willingly permitted multiple futures Bitcoin ETFs to launch beginning in October 2021. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which hit the market first, had one of the most active opening days in NYSE history.\n\nUnlike spot ETFs, futures ETFs are backed by Bitcoin futures contracts\u2014promises to purchase Bitcoin for a set price at a later date. Unlike the Bitcoin spot market, the Bitcoin futures market is a regulated market in which an ETF can have a surveillance sharing agreement, such as the CME Bitcoin futures market.\n\nIn its own filing for a similar product, Grayscale argued that it could enter a surveillance-sharing agreement with the same market when launching a Bitcoin spot ETF. The SEC did not recognize CME Bitcoin Futures as adequately \u201crelated to spot Bitcoin.\u201d"

Many people continue to think they can earn enormous profits by investing in Bitcoin, even though the cryptocurrency market is incredibly unpredictable, and it is difficult to anticipate the future price of BTC.\n\nThis article will go over some short and long-term projections for the price of Bitcoin while taking into account the coin\u2019s potential, utility and other factors into account.\n\nThe majority were unfamiliar with the notion of Bitcoin at the time of its inception and for a few years afterward. Being the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin exceeded several price targets.\n\nFor a very long time, Bitcoin was regarded as the ideal cryptocurrency, but in recent years, the market has seen the introduction of various altcoins that have proven to be superior to Bitcoin. Millions of users continue to invest in Bitcoin despite all these factors, including its popularity, potential worth and comparatively low volatility. Understanding the Bitcoin price is essential since it dominates the cryptocurrency market and influences the pricing of several altcoins.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price in 2022\n\nBitcoin is a smart choice when discussing long-term investments. The price of Bitcoin increased significantly in 2021, surpassing its previous high, but by the year\u2019s close, it fell sharply from November\u2019s peak. The experts estimate that the price of BTC will remain steady throughout the year, but another group believes that it will rise from USD 42,664 to USD 43,011. Although nothing is certain, another Bitcoin price prediction indicates that the year will end with a price of USD 37,450.\n\nExpert\u2019s forecast on the price of bitcoin in 2023\n\nThe precise price forecast for 2023 is difficult to make because different sources provide varying estimates, but the majority predicts that Bitcoin will rise to USD 70,000 and stay there for the duration of the year.\n\nSeveral trade websites forecast that the price will go to USD 65,000 this year and then reach USD 72,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nBitcoin price forecasts by experts for 2024\n\nThe maximum transaction value for bitcoin in 2024 is predicted to be over USD 84,000, with an average price of about USD 78,000. Experts anticipate a better price gain with other cryptocurrencies compared to last year.\n\nBitcoin price forecast by experts for 2025\n\nAccording to the forecasts for 2023 and 2024, Bitcoin\u2019s price will continue to climb in the years to come. The highest possible price for Bitcoin in 2025 is USD 137,071.13. On the other hand, some projections state that the price will only increase to USD 80,000 by the end of 2025.\n\nBitcoin price forecast by experts for 2026\n\nA minimum of USD 184,308.21 and a maximum of USD 214,232.74 are predicted by experts. The average value in 2026 could be around USD 186,289,04.\n\nBitcoin price forecast by experts for 2027\n\nExperts are hopeful about the price of bitcoin in 2027. In recent months, the average price has ranged between USD 280,279,966 and USD 369,103,045. A minimum price of USD 261,604.85 is predicted for Bitcoin, with a price range of USD 306,558.5.\n\nBitcoin price forecasts by experts for 2028 and 2029\n\nBitcoin\u2019s maximum predicted price in 2028 is USD 386,385, with an estimated average price of USD 319,069.36. A price increase ranging from USD 374,918.77 to USD 454,445.60 was predicted by numerous websites. The price of bitcoin might rise as high as USD 527,917.19 in 2029.\n\nBitcoin price forecast by experts for 2030\n\nSeveral well-known websites predict that the price of bitcoin could reach USD 937,274.64, with an average of USD 798,474.46. Many analysts appear to be quite optimistic about the price increase, and some have forecast an increase of at least USD 836,552.147 and as much as USD 962,484.728.\n\nMany experts have used a variety of factors to forecast the potential price of Bitcoin over the next 10 years to be more accurate.\n\nBitcoin halving occasions\n\nExperts have predicted that the value of Bitcoin will halve in 2030, taking into account the current circumstances. The first one is anticipated to occur in 2024, and the second one is most likely to take place in 2028.\n\nHow much will a Bitcoin be worth in 10 years?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is most likely to reach USD 800,000 and USD 1 million in 10 years, according to the cryptocurrency community. The value of Bitcoin is anticipated to rise steadily soon. During the final few months of 2021, the price of Bitcoin was quite close to USD 100,000. In the latter few months of 2021, Bitcoin\u2019s price was very close to USD 100,000. According to the sources, there are several variables that may significantly affect the price of Bitcoin in the future, including impending events, elevated investor confidence in the brand, an influx of institutional investors and more.\n\nPartner content written by Tom White, ASG."

The purpose of the proposed fund was to allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin\u2019s price within the confines of the regulated stock market.\n\nThe Cboe BZX Exchange had originally asked to list the ETF in June 2021. After the first application was rejected in 2022, it reapplied and made new legal arguments in an attempt to get the fund approved.\n\nIn its second application back in May, the Cboe BZX Equities Exchange argued that it has a \u201ccomprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size\u201d that can prevent manipulation of prices. The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF should therefore be allowed to be listed, the exchange argued. According to the application, this surveillance sharing agreement is with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where Bitcoin futures contracts are traded.\n\nThe application also argued that most currency and commodity spot markets are unregulated, but this does not usually mean that an application will be rejected for that reason alone.\n\nRelated: SEC\u2019s \u2018one-dimensional\u2019 approach is slowing progress: Grayscale CEO\n\nIn its response, the SEC rejected these arguments. It stated that the surveillance sharing agreement between Cboe BZX Equities Exchange and the CME does not apply to spot Bitcoin, since only Bitcoin futures contracts are traded at CME.\n\nThe SEC also claimed that having a surveillance sharing agreement is not always necessary, but if such an agreement does not exist, then the exchange must \u201cestablish that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices will be sufficient.\u201d It said that the exchange has not demonstrated this point, so it is not allowing the ETF to be listed.\n\nThe SEC has so far not approved any spot Bitcoin ETF to be listed on an exchange. Grayscale Investment Trust is seeking to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF, and it has sued the SEC for rejecting its proposal. Oral arguments are scheduled to be heard for the Grayscale case in March."

        "content": "Blockchain infrastructure firm Blockstream Corporation Inc. on Tuesday said it raised US$125 million from convertible note and secured loan financing to expand its Bitcoin mining operations and meet strong demand for what it called \u201cinstitutional hosting services.\u201d Kingsway Capital led the convertible note, a form of short-term debt that can convert to equity, joined by other investors including Fulgar Ventures.\n\nSee related article: Binance\u2019s BUSD-peg stablecoin has not always been fully collateralized: report\n\nFast facts\n\nBlockstream completed a US$210 million Series B fundraiser in August 2021 that was used to build several mining facilities, and the latest fundraise will help the company \u201ccontinue to build infrastructure for the future Bitcoin economy,\u201d said Blockstream president and chief financial officer, Erik Svenson, in a statement.\n\nThe company said providing hosting services for miners has remained a resilient market segment, less directly exposed to bitcoin price volatility and narrower profit margins. Blockstream also said it will expand its renewable energy mining products, and continue developing its own bitcoin miner.\n\nBitcoin mining is a process where miners compete to validate transactions on the blockchain by solving complex cryptographic equations and to be compensated with Bitcoin.\n\nProfit margins at miners have been compressed by the 65% drop in Bitcoin prices from the record high of US$68,789 in November 2021.\n\nThese pressures were compounded last week when the Bitcoin mining difficulty rate, which determines how much computing power is required to verify blocks on the blockchain, reached an all-time high of 37.59 trillion. This spike was due to many U.S.-based miners coming back online after a severe winter storm disrupted power supply and forced many to suspend operations.\n\nCore Scientific, one of the largest publicly traded crypto mining firms in the U.S., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the state of Texas in late December as it was unable to repay debt financing for equipment leasing.\n\nBitcoin prices have rebounded more than 35% since the start of the year and traded at US$22,648 at 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday in Hong Kong.\n\nSee related article: Binance stablecoin conversion controversial, but what does it mean for users?"

It claims demand for its hosting services remains high due to the company\u2019s strong track record and substantial scale.\n\nIt also plans to expand its renewable energy mining products and continue the development of its own bitcoin miner.\n\nKingsway Capital led the convertible note, with participation coming from Fulgur Ventures, and others.\n\nBlockstream stated that hosting is a resilient market segment, compared to \u2018prop\u2019 miners who have more exposure to bitcoin price volatility and compressed margins.\n\nDr. Adam Back CEO Blockstream said, \u201cWith 2022 being punctuated by multiple large scale centralised party and protocol failures, we believe this has been a learning experience for the market: that the fundamental value of blockchains is in reducing the need to trust third parties.\n\n\u201cThe resulting refocus on security and decentralisation presents an opportunity for market participants to move to Bitcoin-based non-custodial architectures, like the Liquid ecosystem of startups with decentralised market technology. Liquid\u2019s simple contracts enable self-custody for active traders via offline limit orders, non-custodial options, collateralised loans, all from the security of the traders\u2019 own hardware wallet protected by their own keys. This technology is compatible both with decentralised and centralised order-book exchanges.\u201d\n\nCohen & Company Capital Markets, which is a division of J.V.B. Financial Group, is providing financial advice to Blockstream for the deal.\n\nThis funding follows Blockstream\u2019s Series B round, which closed on $210m in August 2021. The investment, which was led by Baillie Gifford and iFinex, valued the bitcoin infrastructure firm at $3.2bn.\n\nIt leveraged this capital to build several enterprise-class mining facilities with capacity for institutional hosting customers. Funds were also put towards the acquisition of Spondoolies to design and manufacture Blockstream\u2019s own ASIC and enterprise miner.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is still feeling the effects of FTX\u2019s crash. Last week, cryptocurrency brokerage Genesis filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nThis move is part of strategic actions to achieve global resolution to maximise value for all clients and stakeholders.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 FinTech Global"

        "content": "Follow our live coverage of the arrest of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday after U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges.\n\n\u201cS.B.F.\u2019s arrest followed receipt of formal notification from the United States that it has filed criminal charges against S.B.F. and is likely to request his extradition,\u201d the government of the Bahamas said in a statement.\n\nThe arrest was the latest stunning development in one of the most dramatic falls from grace in recent corporate history. Mr. Bankman-Fried, 30, was scheduled to testify in Congress on Tuesday about the collapse of FTX, which was one of the most powerful firms in the emerging crypto industry until it imploded virtually overnight last month after a run on deposits exposed an $8 billion hole in its accounts.\n\nProsecutors for the Southern District of New York confirmed that Mr. Bankman-Fried had been charged and said an indictment would be unsealed on Tuesday. Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement that it had authorized charges \u201crelating to Mr. Bankman-Fried\u2019s violations of our securities laws.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe criminal charges against Mr. Bankman-Fried included wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering, said a person with knowledge of the matter."

        "title": "Bitcoin dialogue at WEF requires 'open-mind' \u2014 Davos 2023 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The World Economic Forum (WEF) convenes in Davos annually, taking over the Swiss skiing town. The main promenade is flush with events and companies renting out properties, with an increasing presence from companies in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.\n\nThe entrance to the WEF compound is restricted by cement barriers and security personnel, drawing an invisible line between the conference and the rest of Davos. Curiously, the last building on the fringe of the conference was branded with familiar logos, that of Polygon and the ever-recognizable Bitcoin (BTC) symbol.\n\nCointelegraph stumbled upon Pietro Poretti while shooting footage of the Bitcoin logo emblazoned on the Tech Lodge stand. Poretti is the director of Lugano\u2019s Economic Development department. This Swiss city has opened up BTC and crypto payments for various municipal accounts for its residents through its Lugano Plan B project.\n\nBitcoin was not on the official agenda of the WEF in 2023. Crypto and blockchain featured across different workshops during the week, but these conversations focused more on Web3, the metaverse, central bank digital currencies and blockchain payment systems rather than decentralized cryptocurrency adoption.\n\nPietro Poretti speaks to Cointelegraph\u2019s Gareth Jenkinson outside the World Economic Forum compound in Davos in January 2023.\n\n2023 is the second year that Lugano\u2019s Plan B set up shop in Davos, as it looks to meet new people, create connections and share its story driving real-world BTC adoption and use cases. The project has been operational since March 2022 and Poretti says while it is in its infancy, it\u2019s about educating and demonstrating the utility of cryptocurrencies:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about promoting crypto payments throughout the city by the city administration. Soon in Lugano, you\u2019ll be able to pay taxes, fines, anything you pay to the municipality.\u201d\n\nLugano Plan B merchants accept payment in the native LVGA tokens, Bitcoin, Lightning Network payments and Tether (USDT). This year, sharing experience with other industries, policymakers and public officials has been a focus. Poretti says payments innovation has been approached with \u201csmall but very concrete steps\u201d focused on providing different but complementary payment gateways.\n\n\u201cI think that at the end of the day if people see the benefits of having an alternative, it\u2019s not something necessarily will replace or is going to replace.\u201d\n\nLugano\u2019s cryptocurrency payments initiative could serve as a tangible case study for the adoption of decentralized payment options worldwide, including inside the WEF. That has not yet happened, but representatives from other cities have asked Lugano for the \u201chows and whys\u201d of their Plan B initiative, which Poretti describes as progress:\n\n\u201cWe think that it\u2019s not about duplicating the exact same approach elsewhere in the world, but maybe it\u2019s about taking inspiration right from what we have done and and and learn something also from our experience. I think that in this respect, Lugano still is a little bit of a pioneer.\u201d\n\nWhile the likes of Ripple and Circle were prominent cryptocurrency ecosystem participants involved in WEF workshops, Poretti believes a more open-minded approach will be required for Lugano to sit at the table to outline their crypto-adoption efforts.\n\nRelated: TradFi and DeFi come together \u2014 Davos 2023\n\nThis requires many moving parts, including financial and legal services participation and political support for similar initiatives. Perhaps most importantly, Poretti believes users will drive discourse and adoption of solutions like Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cIf your citizens are on board and they say, \u2018let's try, we are curious, we are open,\u2019 then when we start seeing the benefits.\u201d\n\nPoretti believes this drives job creation, stimulates economic growth and ensures technological and digital adoption.\n\nBitcoin Suisse was another Swiss-based cryptocurrency industry player that Cointelegraph managed to connect with in Davos. CEO Dirk Klee highlighted the company\u2019s role in founding Crypto Valley and its early work to drive BTC adoption in Switzerland, which has become a leader for worldwide cryptocurrency adoption in many respects.\n\n\u201cI would call it the world headquarters of wealth management and the early adopters, right? We\u2019re partially crypto natives, but who grew into wealthy individuals early on.\u201d\n\nKlee said that Switzerland\u2019s reputation as a well-regulated and safe place to do business has also helped the local cryptocurrency ecosystem grow over time while conceding that its an ongoing journey.\n\nWe have boots on the ground in Davos! Our reporter @gazza_jenks speaks to Dr. Dirk Klee, CEO of @BitcoinSuisseAG about Switzerland and the adoption of cryptocurrency at the @wef. #CTWEF23 pic.twitter.com/ka00dvWpVz \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 18, 2023\n\nHighlighting tough market conditions over the last year, Klee suggested that the industry is at a point where trust and confidence need to be built before considering more participation in events like the WEF:\n\n\u201cA lot of trust has been destroyed and eroded in the last year and we want to be kind of the center point of the next stage of institutionalization, making the place more accessible, easier to use, but also safer.\u201d\n\nKlee also wants to see the likes of Bitcoin Suisse potentially involved in cryptocurrency workshops in future WEF conferences and described going mainstream as \u201cthe ultimate goal.\u201c\n\nThe likes of Lugano and various Swiss regions are prime examples of the potential for cryptocurrency adoption for everyday payments. Furthermore, the presence of Plan B and Bitcoin Suisse in Davos proves that the industry is driving its own conversations with interested parties outside the walls of the World Economic Forum."

        "content": "At the crypto finance service provider, a refocus on the core business results in a reshuffling of management. There are also two departures to report.\n\nBitcoin Suisse is changing its management structure in three areas. Sven Ramspott takes over as chief financial officer (CFO), adding to his current risk officer responsibilities. Pierre-Alain Krohn takes over as head of compliance, and Michael Gauckler, currently head of innovation, will be appointed responsible for products.\n\nThe appointments are related to the reorganization of Switzerland's largest crypto broker, which accompanies a reduction in staff, according to a statement Wednesday. In an interview with finews.com in November, CEO Dirk Klee hinted at such measures.\n\nThe austerity measure is justified by the stock market slump hitting traditional financial and crypto markets simultaneously and lasting longer than expected. Still, the layoffs are well below the average currently seen in the crypto industry.\n\nThree Chiefs in New Roles\n\nRamspott, with over 25 years of experience in leadership roles in the financial industry, joined Bitcoin Suisse in September 2021. In his previous role as chief risk officer and head of risk & compliance, he developed frameworks for compliance and, in particular, anti-money. In doing so, he laid a key foundation for the strategic direction of Bitcoin Suisse, according to the statement.\n\nKrohn spent five years in a leadership role at JP Morgan in Geneva, where he was responsible for anti-money laundering, governance, and controls, before joining Bitcoin Suisse.\n\nGauckler joined Bitcoin Suisse as head of product development & innovation in September 2020. He has 20 years of experience, including as co-founder of Evolute Group, and at Credit Suisse and PwC.\n\nDepartures\n\nWith a refocusing on core markets, there will also be two departures. Mauro Casellini, CEO of Bitcoin Suisse Liechtenstein, is taking on a new challenge. The Liechtenstein, Denmark, and Bratislava locations now fall under the aegis of Chief Operating Officer Peter Camenzind, according to reports.\n\nCurrent CFO Philipp Vonmoos hands over his responsibility to Ramspott at the beginning of February. Vonmoos joined the company in 2017, first leading the custody business and then the finance division. Most recently, he supported the introduction of the new crypto-compatible core banking system.\n\nAccording to Chairman Luzius Meisser, Bitcoin Suisse intends to continue its growth in the institutional sector despite the significant market corrections of the past year."

The crypto market has, at least, paused after rallying since the beginning of the year.\n\nTotal capitalisation is down 2.9% over the last 24 hours but remains just above $1 trillion. Among the top altcoins, Ethereum loses 4.9%, while the rest are down between 2.9% (Litecoin) and 6% (Solana).\n\nIn Bitcoin, today's lows at $22.3K are part of a typical correction from the momentum of last week's lows. A break below $22.2K suggests a deeper correction to the $20.5-21.0K area.\n\nNews Background\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, the cryptocurrency market will enter a new phase in 2023.\n\nThe mindset of long-term investors will determine whether the current wave of bitcoin growth is a bull trap or a strategic buying opportunity, Glassnode believes.\n\nFor the first cryptocurrency to continue its rally, it will need to overcome a key resistance level at $25,000, according to cryptocurrency firm B2C2. Once this milestone is passed, there will be renewed interest from \"outsiders\" looking to get back into the market.\n\nBernstein said that the rally is unlikely to continue as there are no signs of \"new injections\" of funds into the crypto market.\n\nEuropean Parliament lawmakers voted that Banks holding cryptocurrencies in the EU will have to comply with stricter capital requirements for digital assets.\n\nThis article was written by FxPro\u2019s Senior Market Analyst Alex Kuptsikevich."

Only 94 Bitcoin ATMs were added between July to the end of 2022 to the global network, in contrast to 4,169 ATMs during the first half of 2022.\n\nIn January, the Australian city of Coolangatta got its first Bitcoin ATM with integrated Lightning Network capabilities. It works similarly to traditional crypto ATMs but saves significant time due to the layer 2 Lightning solution, and also allows for purchasing very small amounts of BTC."

However, Genesis was required by our agreement to remain solvent\u2014as Genesis can\u2019t ask its clients to play a \u201cheads clients lose, tails Genesis wins\u201d game,\u201d he wrote in response to a post in the Bitcoin subreddit asking, \u201cDid Roger Ver get rekt?\u201d\n\nVer, who earned the moniker of \"Bitcoin Jesus\" as an early adopter of the technology, responded to the post yesterday, then on Wednesday morning shared a screenshot of his comment on Twitter.\n\nThe allegations against him were revealed in a summons filed in New York State Supreme Court on Monday by GGC International, a unit of Genesis Global. In it, the company says Ver owes the company $20,869,788 for \u201cfailure to settle cryptocurrency options transactions\u201d that expired on December 30.\n\nThe Digital Currency Group broker and lending desk filed for bankruptcy on January 20, revealing in court documents that it has more than $150 million to fund its restructuring efforts.\n\nIf any of this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Ver was involved in a similar spat with CoinFLEX last year. The crypto trading platform halted withdrawals in June, citing liquidity problems. It was a common refrain from companies at the time, who were dealing with the fallout from multiple bankruptcies.\n\nBut CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb claimed on Twitter that Ver owes the company $47 million and said he\u2019d already been issued a default notice for failure to pay up.\n\nVer called the claim \u201cblatantly false,\u201d adding that CoinFLEX owed him money, not the other way around.\n\n\u201cNot only do I not have a debt to this counter-party, but this counter-party owes me a substantial sum of money, and I am currently seeking the return of my funds,\u201d he wrote on Twitter."

Discover SCENE\n\nAnother day, another refusal by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow a Bitcoin spot ETF to launch in the United States.\n\nThe latest rejected proposal came from Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest and global crypto ETF provider 21Shares, which for a second time joined forces in an attempt to launch the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. It was initially filed last year on May 13, a month after Ark\u2019s first attempt to list the product on BZX was turned down.\n\nAn ETF\u2014short for \u201cexchange-traded fund\u201d\u2014is an investment vehicle offering indirect exposure to an underlying asset. This can be useful for investing in items that are difficult to own and store by oneself, such as gold, or for many, cryptocurrency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SEC\u2019s rationale for the decision is the same as last time: Ark has failed to demonstrate that the rules of its exchange are adequate to protect the investing public from \u201cfraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn exchange that lists bitcoin-based ETPs can meet its obligations under Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5) by demonstrating that the exchange has a comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to the underlying or reference bitcoin assets,\u201d explained the SEC in its rejection.\n\nETFs would also give institutions a green light to effectively buy Bitcoin when they are otherwise barred from doing so by internal charter. This has made crypto bulls thirsty for such a product to hit the U.S. market\u2014but so far, no dice.\n\nBy contrast, the SEC willingly permitted multiple futures Bitcoin ETFs to launch beginning in October 2021. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which hit the market first, had one of the most active opening days in NYSE history.\n\nUnlike spot ETFs, futures ETFs are backed by Bitcoin futures contracts\u2014promises to purchase Bitcoin for a set price at a later date. Unlike the Bitcoin spot market, the Bitcoin futures market is a regulated market in which an ETF can have a surveillance sharing agreement, such as the CME Bitcoin futures market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn its own filing for a similar product, Grayscale argued that it could enter a surveillance-sharing agreement with the same market when launching a Bitcoin spot ETF. The SEC did not recognize CME Bitcoin Futures as adequately \u201crelated to spot Bitcoin.\u201d"

As the asset attempts to build on its upward trajectory, investors are wondering if this new position signals a sustained rally or is just a temporary bull run.\n\nIn this line, crypto trader and analyst by the Twitter pseudonym of Thescalpingpro, on January 26 stated that Bitcoin hitting $28,000 remains in play, but the digital asset faces heavy resistance ahead.\n\nFollowing the rally, the analyst suggested that Bitcoin bears remain in disbelief as they continue to short the cryptocurrency.

        "title": "Bitcoin hashrate trends - Coinbase",
        "content": "Following 2021 \u2014 a period of rapid capacity expansion and profitability growth for bitcoin miners \u2014 2022 quickly became a comparatively tumultuous year for many operators, particularly those located in North America. A confluence of headwinds, both macroeconomic and crypto-specific, severely impacted the profitability of certain mining operators over the past twelve months, forcing many to restructure their balance sheets or even enter bankruptcy. Notably, however, the hashrate of the bitcoin network \u2014 a measure of the aggregate computing power competing to successfully mine the next block of bitcoin transactions \u2014 has maintained its upward trajectory amidst these headwinds and is currently near all-time-highs. In this report, we explore the cyclical nature of bitcoin mining and the competitive forces driving aggregate network hashrate ever-higher, despite challenging economics for miners and meaningful distress observed in the public markets. While the divergence between bitcoin price and network hashrate observed since late 2021 has caused some pain for certain mining operators, the persistence of network hashrate growth can be an indicator of the heightening security of the bitcoin network and a reflection of the increasing demand for bitcoin mining. The increasing demand for bitcoin mining globally, combined with its industrialization through the growth of public market miners in North America, has the potential to continue to support the upward trajectory of network hashrate in the year ahead. While higher aggregate hashrate may dampen the profitability of smaller scale or less well-capitalized operators (as larger, more well-capitalized players consolidate market share), the current trajectory is objectively a positive outcome for the broader security of the bitcoin network. Chart 1. Bitcoin price and hashrate with key events\n\nInherent cyclicality Given the historical volatility and cyclical nature of bitcoin\u2019s price \u2014 in part driven by the supply side impact of new issuance halving every four years \u2014 it is reasonable to suggest that the business of bitcoin mining would be subject to some amount of cyclicality. Indeed, the market dynamics which characterize the bitcoin mining industry are directionally similar to the production cycles for traditional commodities, such as gold. As demand for the underlying commodity increases, the competition among market participants to establish or expand their operational footprint intensifies and the various inputs associated with building incremental capacity become more expensive. Ultimately, this operational response to an increase in demand of the underlying asset naturally materializes on a lagged basis, expanding up until the point where the demand growth for the underlying asset slows and the cycle begins to turn. Chart 2. ASIC hardware prices per model With respect to bitcoin mining, Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, or ASIC, machines can be viewed as the primary \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d of the industry. We can establish the timeline of this most recent mining cycle by looking at the trajectory of price fluctuations for ASICs over the past few years. Beginning in late 2020, ASIC prices began a rapid ascent in response to the acceleration in the price of bitcoin. While ASIC prices are a decent real-time indicator of increased demand for bitcoin mining, the deployment of ASICs can take anywhere from 3 to 12 months (or even longer given pandemic-induced supply chain issues), meaning that the eventual impact on network hashrate and difficulty occurs on a lagged basis. From late 2020 to early 2022, many mining operators in North America sought to expand their operations to take advantage of the increased profitability of mining, given the rising bitcoin price. This intent to deploy hashrate in the region was accelerated by the Chinese hashrate migration stemming from China\u2019s mining ban in mid 2021, which added to the backlog of hardware awaiting deployment in North America. As operators rushed to acquire ASICs, build infrastructure and deploy hashrate, many took on excessive debt, often collateralized by their bitcoin holdings or ASIC hardware. In hindsight, it is clear that many of these loans did not appropriately account for the possibility of a meaningful decline in the price of bitcoin. Further, once the price of bitcoin began to decline in earnest in March/April 2022, the mounting pressure on miner economics was compounded by factors exogenous to crypto such as rising energy costs and tighter credit conditions. The situation became particularly worrisome for operators who had entered variable rate agreements on either their power contracts or loans, or had failed to appropriately hedge their power costs. This amalgamation of headwinds forced many operators into distress, while those that had more conservatively managed their balance sheets were positioned to capture incremental market share.\n\nPublic miner overview Despite the prevalence of privately held operators in the industry (~177 exahashes (EH)/s or ~75% of aggregate hashrate as of October 2022), publicly traded bitcoin miners represent a rapidly growing segment of the global market for hashrate. The business of bitcoin mining has become increasingly industrialized in recent years as more operators are looking to take advantage of greater access to equity and debt financing available in developed capital markets. Despite a difficult 2022, many of the mining operators in North America are forecasting extensive capacity expansion plans for 2023. Due to the enhanced transparency of these public entities that are required to issue audited financials to shareholders, they can serve as a useful barometer for the health of the mining industry. It should be noted, however, that miners in North America face relatively difficult conditions compared to the global market for hashrate. While they certainly benefit from relative regulatory clarity and developed capital markets, they\u2019ve had to endure rising energy costs , as well as an increasing cost of capital stemming from interest rate hikes. Further, given the influx of hashrate migrating to North America over the past few years, miners in the region may have felt compelled to aggressively expand their operations. Effectively, if a particular operator's share of network hashrate is not growing commensurate with the growth of the aggregate network, their market share is being diluted. A cohort of the top 15 public miners in North America that we will reference throughout this section had a combined hashrate of ~58 EH/s at the end of 2022, representing ~21.9% of aggregate network hashrate. Over the course of 2022, the bitcoin network\u2019s hashrate increased by ~50% and the cohort of public miners detailed in Chart 3 grew their aggregate hashrate by ~109%, thus increasing their relative share of the network (from ~15.7% at the start of the year to ~21.9% by year-end). As shown below, certain miners were able to grow commensurate with (or even beyond) the aggregate growth of network hashrate (>50%), while others lost relative market share within the past year. Those operators that grew their hashrate by greater than ~109% took relative share within this cohort of public miners. Chart 3. Hashrate growth of top public miners in 2022 Hashrate growth, however, does not paint the full picture for this cohort of miners. Certain miners pushed aggressively to expand their hashrate at the expense of the health of their balance sheets. Leverage in the form of ASIC-backed loans became increasingly problematic in early 2022 as the price of ASICs began to plummet. Core Scientific, which filed for bankruptcy in December, raised a total of ~$366M over the past two years from six creditors, collateralized by their hardware (representing 8.9 EH/s of their 15.7 EH/s of total hashrate reported at year-end). Accordingly, the fair market value of the collateral backing these loans (which are now being restructured through bankruptcy) has fallen dramatically (in the range of ~50-70%). Interestingly, the creditors which supplied these ASIC-backed loans to miners are also in a precarious position, as their recourse options include becoming mining operators themselves (taking possession of the ASICs), liquidating the ASICs into a relatively illiquid and declining market, or working with borrowers to restructure the debt. For many creditors, the third option is actually the path of least resistance. While some mining operators are better positioned than others (i.e. those that were more conservative with debt financing and appropriately hedged power costs), it should not be entirely surprising that the most distressed mining operators happen to be located in North America, given the circumstances. Rising input costs, excessive leverage and an environment of increased competition all contributed to the current positioning of this cohort of operators. Chart 4 depicts the total debt levels across this cohort of miners (per EH/s of hashrate), as well as their amount of bitcoin reserves held at year-end. The total debt of this cohort of miners as of their last public filings is approximately US$2.4B in aggregate and they held a combined ~33k BTC (~US$760M) in their reserves at year-end. These metrics provide some insight into the financial positioning of these firms in the context of their go-forward ability to generate and accumulate new bitcoin. Firms like Hut8 and Riot have been able to amass large BTC reserves with relatively little debt. Chart 4. Total debt (per EH/s of hashrate) and bitcoin reserves of top public miners (as of Dec. 31, 2022)\n\nOne miner\u2019s distress is another\u2019s opportunity While mining conditions remain stressed for many operators, the theoretical decline in network hashrate resulting from ASICs being unplugged in North America has largely been offset by incremental sources of hashrate coming online. While data on the scale of some of these new operations and their precise origins is relatively sparse, there are a handful of plausible sources of incremental hashrate being deployed over the past twelve months, namely: Well-capitalized operators in North America : Firms like Riot, Cleanspark and Bit Digital were more conservative with regard to leverage than their peers prior to credit conditions tightening and were able to grow their share of network hashrate over the course of 2022. Further, many of the mining operators in North America have provided forward guidance suggesting meaningful capacity expansion in 2023. It is also worth noting that Foundry, a privately held bitcoin mining pool operator domiciled in the US (a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group), nearly quadrupled its hashrate over the past year (~86 EH/s at current) and is now the largest bitcoin mining pool in the world.\n\n: Firms like Riot, Cleanspark and Bit Digital were more conservative with regard to leverage than their peers prior to credit conditions tightening and were able to grow their share of network hashrate over the course of 2022.

Private or state-owned operators in regions with access to low-to-zero cost energy : Areas such as Russia , the Middle East , Africa and South America have seen increased demand for bitcoin mining leading to meaningful investments to build out mining capacity, typically taking advantage of cheap or otherwise stranded energy sources. Further, this mining cycle may differ from past cycles in that there are more incentives to engage in bitcoin mining, outside of pure speculation on the price of bitcoin. Increasingly, market participants are leveraging the bitcoin network for more specialized use cases, including: The geography-agnostic monetization of stranded energy sources that would otherwise be wasted or are uneconomical to transport to a grid/population : Natural gas flare capture represents a form of bitcoin mining that is actually a net positive in terms of emissions, as it converts otherwise flared methane into carbon dioxide, a much less dense form of carbon emissions. Large energy companies including Shell and Exxon have begun to engage with bitcoin mining, as they can bolster the profitability of their existing operations by monetizing otherwise stranded energy, while also reducing their net emissions.\n\n: Natural gas flare capture represents a form of bitcoin mining that is actually a net positive in terms of emissions, as it converts otherwise flared methane into carbon dioxide, a much less dense form of carbon emissions. Large energy companies including Shell and Exxon have begun to engage with bitcoin mining, as they can bolster the profitability of their existing operations by monetizing otherwise stranded energy, while also reducing their net emissions. Demand response programs aimed at stabilizing isolated energy grids : Bitcoin miners represent a very unique buyer of energy that has the ability to curtail their consumption at any time (known as an interruptible energy load), while most large industrial consumers of energy are unable to economically interrupt their operations. The two main forms of \u201cdemand response\u201d being implemented by mining operators include: (1) negotiating with energy providers/utility companies to lock in a static low cost of electricity for a certain period of time (typically below market rates), under the condition that they will curtail (turn off) when demand from the grid spikes (periods of peak demand). Miners engaging in this form of demand response will ensure that the benefits of mining at a lower static cost will outweigh the potential downtime expected during periods of peak demand. Alternatively, (2) miners will sell power (i.e. turn off machines) back to the market at spot rates. In this arrangement, miners aren\u2019t necessarily forced to curtail in response to peak demand, but instead are directly monetarily incentivized to do so. They will only engage in this form of demand response if the spot rates afforded to them by the market outweigh the profits they would have otherwise generated by mining bitcoin. This method is most prominently implemented by miners operating within the Texas/ERCOT grid.\n\n: Bitcoin miners represent a very unique buyer of energy that has the ability to curtail their consumption at any time (known as an interruptible energy load), while most large industrial consumers of energy are unable to economically interrupt their operations.

This method is most prominently implemented by miners operating within the Texas/ERCOT grid. Bootstrapping renewable (and intermittent) energy sources : The largest impediment for wind and solar capacity to effectively support populations at scale is the near-term profitability of those operators. The intermittent nature of wind and solar, combined with the imbalance of excess capacity versus what can actually be transported to grids for use, means that early-stage wind and solar projects are often producing energy that goes unused. Bitcoin mining can complement the build-out of this capacity by offering a profitable means of energy usage during times of off-peak demand (i.e. smoothing out the intermittency). A joint venture between Tesla, Block, and Blockstream announced last year plans to employ this concept in West Texas, creating a financial incentive to construct solar capacity through mining bitcoin. These incentive-based sources of incremental hashrate are not necessarily dependent on the operators\u2019 desire to accumulate bitcoin, as is traditionally the case for mining operators. Instead, bitcoin mining is being used as a tool to directly monetize energy sources that would otherwise be stranded or uneconomical to transport to a grid or population."

        "content": "Why I think Bitcoin could be a key to saving the environment\n\nby Susie Violet Ward\n\nMost people have heard about Bitcoin but they are unsure about what it is. Its magic internet money, only used by criminals and has no intrinsic value are some of the common misconceptions. Even governments, traditional fund managers and journalists do not yet understand this new technology. The FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) in the media is often misinformed or downright dangerous.\n\n\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that allows money to cross borders without a 3rd party within milliseconds, 24 hours a day and for pennies. It solves a multitude of issues we have with our current financial system including fraud and trust. All transactions are recorded on an open-source blockchain. Since Bitcoin\u2019s inception on January 3 2009, it has never been hacked.\n\nThere is a capped supply of 21 million and each bitcoin is divisible into 100,000,000 Satoshis. With the Lightning Network, it has the potential to be divided into smaller increments, giving it the potential to be used as a world reserve currency. The Lightning Network is a payment protocol layered on top of the bitcoin blockchain to facilitate faster transactions and is enabling bitcoin to scale.\n\nIts hard-capped supply means it cannot be inflated and no more can be made, thus making this the \u2018hardest money\u2019 known to humanity. It means that in the future your bitcoin is mathematically programmed to go up and not down, unlike the fiat money we use today.\n\nBitcoin is decentralised, meaning it\u2019s operated by a global community of miners and nodes, instead of a central authority. Its rules are programmed into code and cannot easily be changed. Sounds amazing, right? So why are there only a select few who have taken the time to learn about this revolutionary \u2018new\u2019 blockchain technology?\n\nWho created Bitcoin?\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin and the first widespread application of blockchain technology. This name is a pseudonym to disguise the person or team who developed Bitcoin. Satoshi was active in the development of Bitcoin up until December 2010, then they withdrew from the project and handed it over to developers who have continued to work on the mission. Many people have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto but, in truth, no one knows who he/she/they is/are.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s development started in 2007 and its release coincided with the 2008 Financial Crisis. A few weeks after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch bailout, Satoshi published the Bitcoin White Paper and hid a message in the genesis block, which was mined on 3 January 2009. Satoshi wrote of the failure and injustice of central banking and our fiat system.\n\nHe also wrote : \u201cWe have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.\u201d\n\nThe birth of Bitcoin would eventually lead to us rethinking the existing global financial models and systems currently in place.\n\nMyth busting\n\nMyth 1 \u2013 Bitcoin has no Intrinsic Value\n\nAs mentioned above, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin and this scarcity is a major driver of its value. In addition to this supply cap, the amount of new Bitcoin being mined is declining over time. An event called a \u201chalving\u201d takes place every four years, and the result is block rewards paid to miners in the network are cut in half. This ensures the supply is always reducing which, by the basic economic principle of scarcity, has worked to keep the price of Bitcoin gradually trending upwards over the long term.\n\nBitcoin also provides value from the work the computers on the network contribute via a process called mining. Powerful computers all over the world supply a vast amount of processing power towards the work of validating and securing every transaction and in exchange, they are rewarded with new Bitcoin. This is called \u2018proof-of-work\u2019 and is essential to the security of the network. I\u2019ll come on to this in more detail later.\n\nMyth 2 \u2013 Bitcoin will be replaced by a competitor\n\nThere are about 22,000 cryptocurrencies and some are direct copies of the original Bitcoin white paper; however, Bitcoin currently makes up approximately 60% of the total cryptocurrency market cap. The transparency and virtue of its task as a decentralised and open currency make it unrivalled to date. Cryptocurrencies are technologies trying to solve different problems and there are others with smart contract capabilities however, these are not all decentralised and do not all use proof-of-work (PoW), more on this later.\n\nMyth 3 \u2013 Not secure\n\nIt\u2019s probably one of the only systems on earth that has not yet been hacked. Satoshi\u2019s genius was to make it so it was easier to join the movement and mine Bitcoin than to try and hack it. It simply moves too fast for it to be hackable. It has been up (online) 99.9% of the time since 2009. The amount of computing power it takes to secure the network is large, however it is still relatively small in comparison to the current financial system. The miners that power the network are located around the globe in over 100 countries. The more miners and nodes the stronger the system becomes as there is no single point of failure. In a nutshell, this is the benefit of Proof of Work.\n\nMyth 4 \u2013 Bitcoin is a bubble\n\nBitcoin has gone through multiple price cycles throughout its 14-year history, each time the price has recovered to achieve new highs. As this is a new technology, boom and bust cycles are to be expected. As adoption increases, Bitcoin\u2019s volatility will subside and it will settle into relative stability.\n\nMyth 5 \u2013 Bitcoin has no real life uses\n\nBitcoin can make payments to anyone in the world without a bank or payment processor, all for a fraction of the cost of traditional banking. The disruptive nature of this technology has the potential to make banks and companies such as Mastercard and Visa obsolete as these payment systems have not changed since the beginning of the 20th Century. In addition to this, nearly every human being on the planet has a mobile phone but not everyone has a bank account. This improves accessibility for all. I\u2019d say this has real value.\n\nMyth 6 \u2013 It is a speculative asset\n\nIt could be considered speculative depending on your vantage point. As this new technology is adopted by institutions, I would argue we are coming out of the speculative phase. I would also argue that Bitcoin has held up better against more traditional equities and gold in the past 6 months.\n\nThis leads me to the most important myth:\n\nMyth 7 \u2013 Bitcoin is bad for the environment\n\nI am not disputing that mining Bitcoin is energy intensive but so are all aspects of the digital world and economy we now live in. The current banking system is nearly 10 x more energy-hungry if we look at the global system of processing transactions, running banks and powering offices. Moving away from traditional banking and into DeFi (Decentralised Finance) would be a benefit to the environment.\n\nExtract from Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Energy Use Compared To Other Major Industries\n\nThe amount of energy used by the Bitcoin network is inconsequential compared to other industries. Most industries round off the amount of global energy used by 1-2% and Bitcoin uses approximately 0.002% of the Global Energy in terawatt hours, which is less than a rounding error.\n\nData sources will vary and the Cambridge Bitcoin Electrical Consumption Index shows a slightly higher consumption rate with the caveat that the exact proportion is dependent on fuel type and power plant efficiency. Regardless of where you get the data, consumption in comparison to other industries is low.\n\nCambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index researchers concluded: \u201cBitcoin\u2019s environmental footprint currently remains marginal at best.\u201d The economic incentives fundamental to Bitcoin i.e. finding the cheapest source of energy to mine from, are helping to drive renewable innovation. They need cheap, renewable energy to make mining economically viable.\n\nThe FUD around this industry falls in line with history when any change is implemented which disrupts. What you often read in the news is centralised misinformation. It is found constantly in the writing on this subject and some journalists are often reporting false and misleading information.\n\nEmail was demonised initially and this new technology was considered too energy intensive and the post service was deemed more efficient. The same narrative to the internet, again it consumes too much energy. The energy argument is used ad-nauseum to demonise a switch from an analogue system to a digital system. These narratives just prove one thing; we are early.\n\nStudies have already concluded that running Bitcoin is more efficient than the current system. In fact, due to the FUD around Bitcoin mining, it has driven the industry to find ingenious ways to run mining equipment from stranded and renewable energy.\n\nBitcoin is even mined from the geothermal energy of volcanoes. According to the Bitcoin Mining Council, 59.5% of all energy used is green. They are working to make it 100% renewable. In addition, the Bitcoin Network could reduce global temperatures via the direct reduction of greenhouse gases. This can be made possible with the use and curtailment of methane from landfill and agriculture and much more.\n\nTroy Cross and Michael Saylor say it best\u2026\n\nTroy Cross on Twitter: \u201cOnce they see how mining balances grids\u2026 Once they see how mining incentivizes renewables and nuclear\u2026 Once they see how mining replaces fossil-powered heating\u2026 Once they see how bitcoin substitutes for more carbon-intensive equities\u2026\u201d / Twitter\n\nMichael Saylor on the Bitcoin Environment Argument\n\nHow Bitcoin is helping the environment\n\nIf we can turn excess and stranded energy into a store of value then the renewables industry will become more cost-effective and economically viable. It would provide money to invest and regenerate, making the industry and its companies even more sustainable by providing investment for the future and consuming stranded energy.\n\nExcess natural gas and geothermal are also being utilised. Some renewable plants need to switch off production when there is a chance of overloading the grid. By switching this excess power over to Bitcoin mining it could help stabilise the grid. Bitcoin provides a solution for using this excess energy while creating value.\n\nBitcoin promotes energy independence and this benefit cannot be overstated. Eventually, mining could become a matter of National Security. Countries that produce cheap energy will be independent because they want to mine cheaply and sustainably. The countries that understand the technology, mathematics and engineering behind this will have a geopolitical advantage. A world with more localised energy production is a more robust world.\n\nMining Bitcoin can assist with our climate goals. There are many projects already up and running. Initiatives such as Gridless Compute work in Africa to mine bitcoin while stabilising grids to prevent brown-outs from excess renewable energy. Vespene Energy is using micro-turbines for harnessing waste methane from multiple landfill sites, preventing the methane from being released into the atmosphere. In Texas, Bitcoin miners have returned energy to the grid when additional electricity is required in extreme hot and cold temperatures. These are just a small number of examples.\n\nIf these enterprises were understood and embraced by politicians and businesses, we could be heading towards carbon-negative energy and the potential of decarbonising and stabilising grids using Bitcoin mining; making the grid greener. This is not a proof of concept; it\u2019s happening.\n\nThis Margot Paez quote sums up the current situation beautifully:\n\n\u201cUsing Bitcoin as a tool for fighting for a habitable future is undoubtedly a kind of Hail Mary pass for the climate, but we are running out of time and mass demonstrations and a failing representative democracy are not doing enough.\u201d\n\nOur rampant consumerism is the environment\u2019s worst enemy. If we can create an economy that provides a good store of value available to all it could steer us away from the debt cycle and debasing currencies.\n\nIf you thought your Bitcoin would be worth more in the future you may think twice about what you are purchasing today. This is quite a meaty subject in itself which I\u2019ll save for another day.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance \u2013 ESG\n\nWikipedia describes ESG as \u2018Environmental, social, and corporate governance is an approach to evaluating the extent to which a corporation works on behalf of social goals that go beyond the role of a corporation to maximise profits on behalf of the corporation\u2019s shareholders.\u2019\n\nIt sounds great and is exactly the information we need to make informed decisions. The ethos is good but the execution needs improvement. It\u2019s difficult to audit and open to fraud. It\u2019s another industry innovation, like carbon offsetting which often means very little when you dig into the detail.\n\nThat said, if managed correctly, the ideology has a lot of potential. For example, if a company were to reinvest its ESG credits into renewables, they could be used to incentivise further investment. The billions of dollars of ESG budgets that have been set aside could be redirected to support the mining industry and the work it does to support renewables. If you offset the infrastructure that supports mining, you\u2019ll get a return. It\u2019s the most ESG-friendly technology that has existed.\n\nProof-of-work vs proof-of-stake\n\nThe difference between the two methods is quite involved. To provide a summary, proof-of-stake (POS) uses randomly selected miners to validate transactions, resulting in those with the most wealth/stake enjoying the most control. Proof-of-work (PoW) uses a competitive validation method to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. PoW, therefore, provides the best security and without this, Bitcoin would not be fully decentralised and the fundamentals would be compromised.\n\nIf you remove the PoW consensus accounting technology you remove the innovation. Bitcoin would essentially revert to the old legacy system where the people that control the books and records can control the network and change the code. The innovation is the consensus mechanism that does not rely on trust; an immutable accounting ledger with a self-auditing network.\n\nGreenpeace is championing a \u2018change the code, not the climate\u2019 campaign, partnered with a \u2018rival\u2019 protocol called Ripple. Ripple paid Greenpeace $5,000,000 to promote a \u2018greener Bitcoin\u2019. If Greenpeace understood Bitcoin and its potential they would be an advocate for the Bitcoin Mining Council instead. What is clear is that the corporate side of Greenpeace is driven by funding which often leads to questionable focus.\n\nIf moving to PoS was possible for Bitcoin, it would remove all the greenhouse-gas-reducing benefits that PoW unlocks. PoS is almost a replica of our current system which prevents a new way of reducing greenhouse gases.\n\nChris Bendiksen of Coinshare put it best when he said \u2018\u2019I\u2019d put the chance of Bitcoin ever moving to proof-of-stake at exactly 0%. There is no appetite among Bitcoiners to destroy the security of the protocol by making such a move.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace and Ripple understand their campaign will be fruitless, in the meantime, environmentalists will have to work harder to undo the damage caused.\n\nA more detailed explanation can be found here: Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake: Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a monetary, environmental, and social revolution. We are at the beginning of the adoption curve and the potential and possibilities are vast.\n\nThe downside is that we are fighting against an old establishment. The potential of Bitcoin\u2019s disruptive technology could upend the existing financial system. I truly believe that early adopters will reap the rewards and those fighting against the revolution will fall behind in the same way that countries late to adopting the gold standard did.\n\nIf we can think of Bitcoin as digital energy and work mining into our renewable energy innovation, we will be on to a winner. There is now a global system in place that can send value across borders in seconds and for pennies. The unbanked can now be a part of the system.\n\nTo understand Bitcoins\u2019 value, you need to understand the technology, the philosophy and the potential. It\u2019s a global collateral that can be sent to anyone on the planet, with a smart phone, for pennies and received in seconds. Now throw in its green credentials and you have a game changer.\n\nBitcoin the open global network is here to stay and more and more people hold and transact with its BTC token. It is being intimately threaded into our energy grids at the base level and the benefits it brings are finally being recognised. From overbuilding renewables to reducing bills for customers.\n\nNot many industries can take a potent greenhouse gas like methane and convert that into work that both secures a global network and drives down CO2. Bitcoin does this and more. A glimpse of the world weaned off throwaway consumerism and an open landscape where we can see precisely what our money costs us. It should not cost us the world and its ecosystem.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to unlearn what we have always known. We are at a point in history where we can explore, embrace and become empowered by this new technology or become late adopters and fall behind those that had the foresight to investigate and learn. I know which side of history I\u2019d rather be on."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) rally seemed to have stagnated below the $23,000 level as investors attempt to predict the next price movement. As uncertainty prevails, one technical indicator that investors are closely watching is the golden cross formation.\n\nIn this line, Bitcoin is on the verge of a potential golden cross formation pattern, as the 50-day moving average (MA) approaches crossing above the 200-day MA, crypto commentary Twitter account Bitcoin Archive shared on January 26.\n\nOne of the consequential golden crosses in 2019 resulted in Bitcoin surging in value when the asset was trading in the zone of $5,000. The resulting rally saw Bitcoin hit an all-time high of almost $69,000 in 2021.\n\nBitcoin approaching golden cross. Source: TradingView\n\nImpact of the golden cross on Bitcoin\n\nThe golden cross is mostly a bullish indicator that suggests that the short-term trend of Bitcoin is shifting upward and could potentially lead to a sustained rally. Notably, the golden cross formation has historically preceded price increases in Bitcoin.\n\nThe market is likely watching this potential pattern, as it could signal the start of a new bull market for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies amid uncertainty regarding the general health of the digital assets market.\n\nOverall, the approaching golden cross formation is a positive sign for the cryptocurrency market and could be a sign of a bright future for Bitcoin. At the same time, it will be of interest if it signals a sustained rally or just a temporary surge in value bearing in mind that other technical indicators point to bearishness in the short term.\n\nOn the flip side, as reported by Finbold, Bitcoin\u2019s fortunes remain in limbo, with the maiden cryptocurrency starting at the dreaded death cross. The death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average drops below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend. In particular, as of January 25, on-chain data indicated that Bitcoin was facing the first-ever one-week death cross in history.\n\nFurthermore, as crypto expert Steve Courtney stated, if Bitcoin realizes the one-week death cross, indicators point to a possible one-day golden cross on February 7.\n\nBitcoin death cross and golden cross chart. Source: Steve Courtney\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was trading at $23,113, gaining over 1.5% on the daily chart. On the weekly chart, BTC is up more than 10%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAt the same time, a summary of Bitcoin\u2019s one-day technical analysis corresponds with the \u2018buy\u2019 sentiment gauging at 14, while moving averages are for a \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 13. Elsewhere, the asset\u2019s oscillators are for \u2018sell\u2019 at 3.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nIt is worth noting that Bitcoin continues to face resistance at $23,000, and breaching the level can potentially open room for further rallying.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the bellwether of the cryptocurrency market, will peak at US$29,095 in 2023 before dropping to US$26,844 by the end of the year, a new report forecasts.\n\nBut the price of BTC, currently around US$23,000, will jump to US$77,492 in 2025 and US$188,451 in 2030, according to a panel of 56 crypto and fintech specialists gathered by Finder.com, a comparison website for products and services.\n\nSeasonal Tokens creator and founder Ruadhan O thinks bitcoin\u2019s price is still suppressed by worries about the financial health of centralized businesses in the industry.\n\n\u201cThe price is low because possible imminent catastrophes are being priced in,\u201d he says. \u201cBy the end of the year, market sentiment will have changed, and after the fear goes away, the market will rediscover the scarcity of bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAs it is, 65% of panellists, including FxPro senior market analyst Alexander Kuptsikevich, believe that BTC is underpriced. Only 20% say it\u2019s priced fairly, while the remaining 16% say it\u2019s overpriced.\n\n\u201cThe phase of the most active cryptocurrency sell-off is over. 2023 will be a year of careful price recovery. However, a real FOMO (fear of missing out) market is unlikely to come until 2024-2025,\u201d Kuptsikevich says.\n\nBitcoin needs two things to rebound: the return of bullishness on Wall Street and the Federal Reserve\u2019s exit from its rate-tightening policy, asserts Finance Magnates senior analyst and editor Damian Chmiel.\n\n\u201cThe former will not happen without the latter, and we are left to wait patiently for now. In the long term, however, I believe bitcoin will become a popular choice among traders,\u201d Chmiel says.\n\nUniversity of Canberra senior lecturer John Hawkins is more bearish, predicting that BTC will close the year at US$10,000, before dropping to US$5,000 in 2025 and US$500 in 2030.\n\nHawkins believes that bitcoin has no useful role as an asset after it\u2019s been \u201cspruiked as a payments instrument, safe haven, inflation hedge and diversification asset\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, more of the crypto companies that are shedding staff and restricting withdrawals, and no longer have FTX to bail them out, will fail, putting downward pressure on the bitcoin price,\u201d he adds.\n\nWhile BTC is currently rallying above US$20,000, the panel expects it to drop to US$13,067 at some point in 2023 \u2013 the lowest it\u2019s been since October 2020.\n\nFollowing the recent market crash and FTX collapse, a fifth (21%) of Finder\u2019s panel believe institutional investors will leave the crypto market for other asset classes this year. However, the majority (75%) think otherwise, while the remaining 4% are unsure.\n\nAskTraders senior cryptocurrency and forex analyst Nick Ranga is one of those who believe that institutional investors will leave crypto this year. Commenting on BTC specifically, he says: \u201cWith inflation still uncomfortably high and recession risk looming, overall market sentiment remains risk-off. US interest rates are expected to peak at around 5% in the first half of 2023 so we could see investors return to riskier assets later in the year. In the short term, there could still be more downside.\u201d\n\nRouge International managing director Desmond Marshall is part of the majority who think institutional investors are here to stay: \u201cUnless there are more sudden surprises like FTX, the market is now undergoing a clean-up of scammy and faulty exchanges and companies. After this clean-up and with the Fed interest continuing to hike, and with the BTC upcoming halving in 2024, there should be stronger support during H2 of 2023.\u201d\n\nOverall 50% of Finder\u2019s panel say now is the time to buy BTC, 37% hold, and 13% sell."

        "title": "Bitcoin Bull Run? Is it time to Invest - Cryptocurrency - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As you probably know, crypto markets went through the most challenging year in 2022. The problems started with Terra Luna\u2019s downfall, followed by worldwide economic issues, rising interest rates, and increasing energy bills. Then, when it looked like the markets would recover, the FTX scandal increased fear, forcing even more investors out of the markets.\n\n2023 will likely be the make-or-break year for the industry, and judging from the first weeks of January, crypto markets could also recover and reach new all-time highs. The top-ranked crypto, Bitcoin, experienced a 23% growth since January 7, signaling a potential bull run for the entire market. So, let\u2019s see what\u2019s behind the recent Bitcoin price rally and why cryptos like MEMAG, FGHT, CCHG, RIA, and D2T are safer investments.\n\nCan Bitcoin Recover in 2023?\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the entire economic system is standing on shaky legs. The last three years have put enormous strain on the global economy. Even though central banks and governments are doing everything they can to slow down inflation, almost everyone agrees that a recession will be inevitable in 2023. Of course, a global recession is the last thing crypto markets need right now, but the fear factor is dropping despite the rising uncertainty. As a result, 2023 will likely be a year of caution among crypto investors, and most experts don\u2019t expect a crypto bull run by the end of the year.\n\nThat said, traders are already focusing their strategies on 2024. While Bitcoin is unlikely to hit previous all-time highs of $69k in 2023, the crypto has bottomed out. In other words, most experts agree that the crypto markets will enter a recovery period. The recent Bitcoin price increase is a welcomed change compared to the previous six months, but most institutional investors still choose to watch the markets from the sidelines.\n\nThe good news is that most indicators are showing positive signs of recovery, but investors are still waiting for a rally. But, of course, the same approach stands for most successful cryptos, and if things stabilize, the markets could enter a whole new era of hypergrowth. So, let\u2019s see what the experts predict about Bitcoin\u2019s price changes in the next few years.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\n2023 could turn out to be one of the most volatile years for the crypto markets on record. Future Bitcoin price predictions are widely different between financial and crypto experts. Some think the world\u2019s highest-ranked crypto could bottom out at $5,000, while others believe the only way from here is up. Here is a quick overview of the most likely turn of events by 2035.\n\nAfter analyzing various technical indicators, social sentiment, and other KPIs, Bitcoin bottomed out in late 2022, and current price predictions for 2023 put the average price at $29,677. The climb won\u2019t be as sharp as before due to the worldwide financial situation, but the token is still expected to grow steadily.\n\n2024 should be much more exciting for all Bitcoin holders. The year could end with prices as high as $45,000, which is an impressive price spike compared to right now. The trend will continue in 2025, as most experts put their predictions between $61,125 and $80,212. That said, Bitcoin depends on many factors, and since the markets are more volatile than ever, investors are still on the sidelines. Instead, many moved their funds into emerging crypto projects with high token utilization and excellent tokenomics. Let\u2019s see which ones are the highest rated.\n\nTop Crypto Investment Options in 2023\n\nWhile many existing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, still have a long way to go to recover, a few upcoming crypto projects have attracted impressive investments in the past few weeks.

Each game belongs to a different genre, and all of them are incredibly well-designed and super-fun to play. These games are a breath of fresh air in the otherwise generic mobile game industry, and the blockchain features will introduce new systems that could revolutionize mobile gaming.\n\nThe ecosystem has two currencies. The first one is called GEMS, and it\u2019s used only for in-game purchases, upgrades, etc. The second main currency is called MEMAG. Players can exchange their GEMS for MEMAG tokens they can sell on the market after the first CEX/DEX listings.\n\nThe official Meta Masters Guild MEMAG token presale is open right now, so you can invest early and enjoy the highest returns in the future.

That\u2019s where Calvaria: Duels of Eternity jumps in. It not only offers all of the above but also promises an exciting trading card experience with a chance to earn in-game tokens.\n\nCalvaria has two versions of the game.

It may look like a common crypto trading platform, but Dash 2 Trade is a unique crypto exchange with a full suite of tools designed to increase your ROI and bring your game to a new level.\n\nThe platform appeared just as the crypto markets bottomed out and became more volatile than ever. Since it\u2019s designed to simplify trading and present all essential data from a single dashboard, Dash 2 Trade is just what traders need to cope with increasingly complex markets.

        "title": "Blockstream raises $125 million USD to expand crypto mining services - BetaKit - Canadian Startup News",
        "content": "The Montr\u00e9al firm claims demand for its hosting services remains high, despite volatile market.\n\nMontr\u00e9al-based startup Blockstream, which develops Bitcoin and blockchain technologies, has raised $167.3 million CAD ($125 million USD) in convertible note and secure loan financing as it hopes to optimize the volatile crypto market.\n\nKingsway Capital led the convertible note, with participation from other investors, including Fulgur Ventures. Blockstream said this recent capital sum will be allocated toward the expansion of its mining facilities to meet \u201cthe strong demand\u201d for Blockstream\u2019s institutional hosting services.\n\nIn 2021, Blockstream raised $266 million CAD ($210 million USD) in what it described as the first close of its Series B round. That financing brought Blockstream\u2019s valuation to $4 billion. Samson Mow, who was CSO at Blockstream at that time, told BetaKit that Blockstream aimeds to raise between $300 million and $400 million USD for its Series B round, though the company hads not announced any additional funding between then and now. Mow left his role at Blockstream in March 2022, according to his LinkedIn page, and is now CEO of bitcoin company Jan3.\n\nBloomberg reported in December 2022 that Blockstream was raising new funding at a lower valuation than its 2021 Series B round. The outlet reported that people familiar with the matter said the valuation may be below $1 billion, which would strip Blockstream of its unicorn status designation.\n\nFounded in 2014, Blockstream\u2019s sidechain technology, dubbed Liquid Network, enables trustless Bitcoin swap settlements and smart contracts, while allowing financial institutions to tokenize assets. Among its blockchain-focused product suite, its Blockstream Mining offering provides colocation services to miners, across multiple enterprise-class mining facilities.\n\nRELATED: Blockstream secures $266 million CAD at $4 billion valuation to monetize the Liquid Network\n\nAccording to Blockstream, demand for its hosting services remains high despite volatility in the crypto market, due to its \u201cstrong track record and substantial scale, coupled with an industry-wide shortage of available power capacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHosting has remained a resilient market segment as compared with \u2018prop\u2019 miners (and their lenders) who have been more directly exposed to bitcoin price volatility and compressed margins,\u201d Blockstream said.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is on a downward trend, with a string of negative news events in the space, including the downfall of FTX and most recently Genesis. Bitcoin is now worth around $17,000, compared to its $69,000 value in November 2021.\n\nBlockstream touts itself as one of the world\u2019s largest bitcoin mining operators, with over 500 megawatts in its development pipeline. The company said it also plans to expand its renewable energy mining products, and continue developing its own bitcoin miner."

        "title": "Who is the 'Bitcoin Kid:' inside the largest cryptocurrency theft by one person in history - CityNews Toronto",
        "content": "A major crime occurred in February of 2020 in Hamilton, but few of us had any idea it happened and why.\n\nThe victim, a billionaire in California, looked at his cell phone to discover he had been locked out, meaning someone had taken control of the phone.\n\nAs shocking as that might have been, even more troubling was the fact that more than $45 million worth of cryptocurrency that he owned had been yanked from an online wallet where he held those funds.\n\nJosh Jones, the victim of this theft, was an early pioneer investor in cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s a decentralized digital currency that allows people to transfer funds from one person to another anywhere in the world, so long as they too are on the Bitcoin network.\n\nPeople like Jones are often referred to as a \u201cwhale\u201d amongst the crypto community, a name given to those who hold large quantities of crypto.\n\nJones may not be the biggest whale in the sea, but he\u2019s rich and was well known in the crypto space. As in most crimes, the bigger and more well known you are, the bigger a target you become.\n\nAfter discovering his phone had been hacked and he was missing those hefty funds, Jones reached out to police in Los Angeles, where he lived.\n\nA major investigation, which eventually involved the F.B.I. and U.S. Secret Service, was launched.\n\nBut Jones decided not to leave it all up to investigators. He also made a post to Reddit, an online forum with a big audience made up of crypto investors.\n\nJones pleaded for help, asking anyone who might have any knowledge on who hacked his funds and in the hopes of stopping any future transactions draining his money, but it was too late.\n\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin, all transactions where wealth is transferred takes place on a system known as the blockchain.\n\nIt\u2019s a public ledger which records all Bitcoin transactions in chronological order and while these transactions are public, the people participating are kept anonymous.\n\nOne of Bitcoin\u2019s main attractions is anonymity. Each person is assigned a public I.D., made up of a series of letters and numbers and is seen on the ledger.\n\nThe blockchain itself is very secure and tough to corrupt or hack. As for Jones, he noticed his funds were being transferred, the problem was he couldn\u2019t figure out who was doing it. Given the speed of the transfer process, this can be very difficult to find out.\n\nMeanwhile, over 500 kilometres north of Jones\u2019 home, detectives who weren\u2019t even part of the initial investigation began to get inundated with tips about the theft.\n\nAt the time, Detective Samy Tarazi was working for the Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team (REACT) in Santa Clara County California, a task force that investigates cyber crimes and was eventually assigned to help crack the case.\n\nSanta Clara County is home to Silicon Valley, home to Google, Apple, and a number of other major tech companies. The REACT team was well known across the globe for solving past crypto thefts so tipsters often went to them to report crimes.\n\nIn the upcoming \u201cVeraCity: The Bitcoin Kid,\u201d you\u2019ll find out about the one tip in particular that lead investigators to their main suspect: a teenager who lived in Hamilton, Ont.\n\nWhat happened next is a cat-and-mouse game that ended in dramatic fashion, including for hearing for the first time one of the major players involved in the Bitcoin heist.\n\nTo date, only a fraction of the $45 million has been recovered. Find out what happened to the rest when \u201cVeraCity: The Bitcoin Kid\u201d premieres on Sunday, Jan. 29 at 10 p.m. ET on Citytv."

        "content": "The Ethereum, left, Bitcoin, center, and Litecoin logos on an event board during the Dubai Crypto Expo at the Festival Arena in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Wednesday, Oct. 5, 2022.(Bloomberg/Christopher Pike)\n\nIn the next few years, Deribit also want to obtain broker licenses in countries like the UK, Brazil and Singapore, in an effort to drive more clients onto the exchange\n\nBloomberg \u2014 Deribit, the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (XET) options exchange, is making plans to relocate to Dubai as soon as the third quarter if authorities in the crypto-friendly emirate provide more clarity on regulations.\n\nThe trading platform, which has been based in Panama since 2020, is preparing to open a Dubai office with about 10 people, a mix of core employees and local hires, David Dohmen, chief legal compliance and regulatory officer at Deribit, said in an interview. Some employees will continue to be based in Panama. Deribit\u2019s Netherlands-based parent company and related subsidiaries currently employ 95 people globally, roughly double year-ago levels.\n\nThe November collapse of the rival FTX crypto exchange shook trust in the sector, resulting in outflows across the industry, including between 10% and 15% at Deribit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a number of clients who basically intimated to us that they would like to trade on a crypto exchange that\u2019s actually regulated,\u201d Dohmen said. \u201cIn Panama we are not regulated. Also we also saw where the regulatory winds were blowing, and there was a drive toward regulation across the globe.\u201d\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\nDubai, the sun-splashed multinational hub of the Middle East, has made extensive efforts to woo the world\u2019s largest firms with crypto-friendly policies. As some financial centers tightened regulations last year, many UAE officials were touting virtual assets as a key pillar for economic growth and diversification. Companies like Binance, the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange, have expanded in Dubai.\n\nVIEW + Panama Ponders Cryptocurrency Legislation The Central American country\u2019s banking system could benefit from the use of crypto, analysts say, while urging caution\n\n\u201cWe felt that the whole regulatory regime was more tailored to crypto than other jurisdictions,\u201d Dohmen said. \u201cIt\u2019s more flexible. The government and the regulator are welcoming crypto as a product.\u201d\n\nBut the recent blowups of several crypto companies that had flocked to the UAE have prompted a regulatory rethink in the Gulf state. Earlier this month, the federal government introduced more formal rules, which local lawyers said could rein in some of the powers previously left to the nation\u2019s dozens of free zones.\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\nDeribit plans to submit an application and supporting documents for a Full Market Product license to Dubai\u2019s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority once the agency gives an update on its regulatory regime, Dohmen said.\n\nDeribit is now also working to appoint a well-known auditor, said Luuk Strijers, Deribit\u2019s chief commercial officer. The company was profitable in 2022 despite being impacted by the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, he said.\n\nIn the next few years, Deribit also want to obtain broker licenses in countries like the UK, Brazil and Singapore, in an effort to drive more clients onto the exchange, Dohmen said.\n\n--With assistance from Anna Irrera\n\nRead more on Bloomberg.com"

        "content": "Bitcoin started 2023 in a positive tone. The coin recently went above $23,000.00 for the first time since August.\n\nThis looks impressive, especially after the recent unfortunate events in the crypto world.\n\nBut is Bitcoin still a good investment? Or should you invest in newer coins like Meta Masters Guild, Fight Out, RobotEra and C+Charge?\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the article.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction 2023 \u2013 2030\n\nYear Potential Low Potential High 2023 $20,000 $75,000 2025 $50,000 $100,000 2030 $70,000 $150,000\n\nDespite the recent positive price trend, Bitcoin is still 67% below its all-time high. As we can see from the table above, Bitcoin should trade between $20,000 and $150,000 between 2023 and 2030.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price will largely depend on a few factors:\n\nThe level of adoption of the coin in real-life\n\nThe growth of the Lightning Network\n\nRelease of Bitcoin spot ETF\n\nEffect of the government regulations on the coin\n\nAlthough predictions show a positive trend for the coin, it is crucial to mention that Bitcoin is well-known for extreme price dips.\n\nPutting aside the positive price predictions, Bitcoin is still a risky investment. The more you invest, the bigger losses will be if the price starts decreasing.\n\nSo, instead of investing in a Bitcoin that is unstable, you can invest in Meta Masters Guild, Fight Out, RobotEra and C+Charge.\n\nThese are new and smaller coins with bright price predictions and huge potential to become the next Bitcoin replacement.\n\nMeta Masters Guild continues to break all records\n\nMeta Masters Guild\u2019s presale rose above all expectations after raising $1.2 million in less than 15 days.\n\nPreviously, the project raised $100k 24 hours after the presale launch.\n\nAccording to the experts, the project will subdue the crypto market with its innovative approach to Play 2 Earn.\n\nAs the fastest-growing Play 2 Earn guild, Meta Masters Guild rewards players for their time invested in playing. The goal of the project is to keep players in the game long-term.\n\nPlayers will earn Gems \u2013 rewards for their time spent in the game \u2013 that they can later change for MEMAG tokens.\n\nThis approach showed itself as a cat\u2019s whiskers. The demand for the token is dire, and experts say early investors will get 129% higher rewards after the presale ends.\n\n>>>Buy MEMAG Now<<<\n\nFight Out surpassed the $3 million mark in the presale\n\nFight Out is another token that is breaking all sale records. The project recently raised $3.2 million in the presale and secured the first exchange listings.\n\nBitforex and LBANK will list the FGHT token on their exchanges once the presale ends. According to the Fight Out Twitter, the Bitforex listing is planned for April 6.\n\nThe project targets the fitness industry \u2013 estimated to be worth $96 billion \u2013 with its unique approach to fitness and health.\n\nWith Fight Out, users can exercise from their homes and earn dire rewards. They can join challenges, learn new sports techniques and share all their achievements with other peers.\n\nIn fact, the project provides some of the best rewards in the industry since users can buy coaching sessions and gym equipment with the rewards their receive.\n\nFight Out connects the virtual world and the real-life world of fitness. Each user gets NFT in a form of an avatar that progresses positively as users complete workouts and challenges.\n\nPredictions say the coin could hit $0.32 by the end of 2025 and $0.60 by the end of 2030 \u2013 terrific potential that definitely justifies the title of one of the best coins in 2023.\n\n>>>Buy Fight Out Now<<<\n\nRobotEra Generates a Huge Excitement as the Presale Continues to Break All Records\n\nRobotEra is, without a doubt, one of the best metaverse projects of 2023.\n\nThe project raised $750k in the presale, and experts predict TARO price will increase by 50x by the time the token hits the exchanges. Additionally, early investors can expect a 5000% return on their investments.\n\nThe project has fascinating features that make its gameplay very appealing. The players can build their assets (land, buildings, sports courts, etc.) and earn dire rewards. Not only can they trade these assets at the marketplace, but players can also charge entrance fees, rent billboards, land, and buildings or participate in events and earn rewards.\n\nSince it\u2019s a part of the growing metaverse ecosystem, RobotEra is predicted to be worth $10 trillion by 2030.\n\nThis fact, combined with appealing gameplay and broad earning possibilities, makes RobotEra one of the best coins to invest in in 2023.\n\n>>>Buy RobotEra Now<<<\n\nC+Charge is the best green crypto of 2023\n\nThe future is green, at least judging by the success of green cryptos. C+Charge is one of the eco-friendly coins that rewards EV drivers with carbon credits.\n\nThe first project that focuses on drivers and not on EV manufacturers and EV charging station owners, C+Charge raised $380k in the presale.\n\nThe project looks to democratize carbon credits and unify EV charging payments process. Users can find the nearest charging station from over 1.8 million charging stations worldwide.\n\nEco-friendly crypto is the future of the market, and all experts agree they will have a more stable price. Additionally, green coins are less like to be under the impact of government regulations since most laws now favor eco-friendly initiatives.\n\n>>>Buy C+Charge Now<<\n\nWrapping up\n\nEven though Bitcoin has tremendous potential, investments in smaller coins like Meta Masters Guild, Fight Out, RobotEra, and C+Charge will pay off in multiple ways.\n\nMeta Masters Guild is the fastest-growing guild that revolutionizes the world of P2E.\n\nFight Out offers the best rewards in the industry.\n\nRobotEra is a part of the growing system with the potential to be worth $10 trillion by 2030.\n\nC+Charge is the future of crypto, offering an innovative approach to the carbon credits industry.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Crypto news today: Why Flow has sunk 11.9 per cent as Bitcoin price dips two per cent\n\nThe native coin of eco-friendly blockchain Flow has taken a tumble in the last 24 hours, falling 11.9 per cent from its recent high on Monday.\n\nIt follows a rapid jump in the coin\u2019s value because of the announcement of The Flow mainnet spork, a hard fork which promised to improve the blockchain\u2019s potential transactions per second and therefore its ability to compete against other blockchain networks.\n\nThe sharp downturn in price suggests that the news prompted an artificial buying frenzy that has now turned into a pressure to sell.\n\nIn brighter news, Aptos is maintaining its strength, currently up 71.4 per cent over the last seven days in the wake of a flurry of integrations, including with NFT-based game Crypto Kitties, crypto exchange PancakeSwap and crypto wallet Atomic Wallet.\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, has dipped back below the $23,000 (\u00a318,662.20) mark, although such fluctuations are not dissuading some analysts from predicting the cryptocurrency\u2019s value rising to the $30,000 (\u00a324,242) mark this year.\n\nOthers are not so optimistic, betting that the recent hike in Bitcoin\u2019s value is pushing traders towards selling, in anticipation of the market once again trending downwards.\n\nIt comes as Binance sees itself embroiled in the cryptocrime investigation of cryptocurrency exchange Bitzlato, whose founder Anatoly Legkodymov was recently charged for running it as an unlicensed money exchange business."

        "content": "Despite several market headwinds, the Bitcoin blockchain processed over $8.2 trillion last year which is $260,000 every second.\n\nThe Bitcoin network processed 33% more in transaction value when compared to VISA and three times more than MasterCard.\n\n2022 wasn\u2019t quite exciting for Bitcoin investors across the world as the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency plummeted by over 60% in one of the most brutal market crashes in the history of crypto.\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin blockchain network still managed to hit a few key milestones in terms of transaction value during 2022. During the last year, a staggering $8.2 trillion in value was transferred over the Bitcoin blockchain. As per the data shared by crypto analytics firm CoinMetrics, this data turns out to be $260,000 per second.\n\nThis magnitude of transactions despite the bear market highlights Bitcoin\u2019s significant jump in adoption as well as its role in the global financial system. But, the data also shows that during the second half of 2022, the total number of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain plunged significantly during the second half of the year.\n\nThis was specifically the time when the cryptocurrency market witnessed some of the biggest bankruptcies in the history of the crypto market. It all started with the fall of the Terra ecosystem in May which triggered the downfall of popular crypto lenders like Voyager and Celsius.\n\nFurthermore, the crypto market faced a double-whammy in November with the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX which resulted in massive withdrawals and drying up of liquidity from the market. This had a direct impact on investor participation in the market which went downhill and as a result, Bitcoin transactions also tanked significantly.\n\nBitcoin Beats VISA and Mastercard\n\nDespite all the hurdles in place, the world\u2019s largest crypto Bitcoin managed to outperform two of the largest payments processing networks \u2013 VISA and Mastercard. During the last year of 2022, VISA processed less than $6 trillion in total value while than of Mastercard was $2.5 trillion.\n\nIt means that the Bitcoin network processed 33% more in transaction value, in comparison to VISA. Similarly, it processed more than three times the total transaction value processed by Mastercard.\n\nBitcoin is slowly emerging as one of the biggest challengers to some of the biggest payment systems. However, these traditional payment systems are expected to increase their transaction values in the subsequent years. Thus, Bitcoin here has a big challenge to undertake in order to keep up with the competition.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest crypto Bitcoin (BTC) has had a good start to the year 2023 so far jumping more than 33% this month. However, Bitcoin still continues to face the macro challenges of higher inflation and uncertainty with the Federal Reserve Monetary policy.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "EU Will Allow Banks To Hold 2% Of Capital In Bitcoin - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The European Union continues to push hard for clear regulations for the Bitcoin and crypto industry. After the final vote on the European Union\u2019s draft legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies, the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), was postponed until April 2023 due to technical difficulties, the European Parliament yesterday approved new banking regulations.\n\nAs Reuters reports, the Economic Affairs Committee of the European Parliament on Tuesday approved a bill to implement the final stage of the post-financial crisis global bank capital rules (Basel-III) starting in January 2025. It stipulates that volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will be considered the riskiest investment.\n\nIn doing so, the European Union is following the Bank of International Settlement (BIS), which essentially divides cryptos into two distinct groups. Group 1 represents tokenized assets and stablecoins with approved stabilization mechanisms, while it is questionable whether Tether or USDC meets the requirements.\n\nGroup 2 includes stablecoins without BIS-approved stabilization mechanisms and volatile cryptocurrencies. This group classification entails that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptos require banks to apply a \u201crisk weight\u201d of 1,250%.\n\nThis means that European banks must hold more than one euro of free capital for every euro of cryptocurrencies. Markus Ferber, a German member of the European People\u2019s Party in the EU Parliament, said that the effort is designed to \u201cprevent instability in the crypto world from spilling over into the financial system.\u201d\n\nEU Banks Allowed To Hold 2% Of Capital In Bitcoin And Crypto\n\nIn addition, the new directive stipulates that banks can hold a maximum of 2% of their capital in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, while the European Parliament\u2019s economic committee endorsed several temporary derogations to give banks more time to adjust.\n\nAlready last year, the BIS Basel Committee warned against cryptocurrencies. Since then, banks have been advised to allocate a maximum of 1% of their total assets to cryptocurrencies.\n\nYesterday\u2019s approved guidance is based on a draft that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized on December 16. The Basel Committee is a group of several dozen central banks and banking regulators that have no lawmaking authority themselves but develop the standards for prudential regulation of banks.\n\nAs Ferber has indicated, lawmakers cite the chaos in the crypto market in recent months as further evidence that such regulation is needed. The United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries are taking similar steps, with the European Union setting a unique precedent with its requirement that banks must hold enough capital to fully cover holdings of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nNotably, yesterday\u2019s approval by the European Parliament\u2019s Economic Affairs Committee is the first step in the approval process. The directive still needs to be approved by the entire European Parliament in July and submitted to national finance ministers in the Council of the European Union for the regulations to take effect.\n\nEven though the regulations can be very negative at first glance, it should be emphasized that the BIS and the EU do not want to issue a Bitcoin and crypto ban for European banks, but only want to introduce a limit, as well as capital coverage.\n\nBitcoin Price Today\n\nAt press time, the BTC price stood at $22,735. Thus, Bitcoin continues to range between $22,310 and $23,350 on the 4-chart.\n\nFeatured image from Guillaume Perigois / Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2023 sustained rally has emerged at a period market conditions are still dominated by uncertainty stemming from last year\u2019s bear environment. With Bitcoin rallying by almost 40% since the start of the year, investors are still looking for hints likely to dictate the next price movement.\n\nAs the maiden crypto faces resistance at $23,000, TradingShot, a pseudonymous analyst on TradingView observed that Bitcoin is staring at the dreaded death cross. In particular, the digital asset is approaching the first-ever one-week death cross in history, a scenario that could invalidate the ongoing bullish trendline.\n\n\u201cIt is inevitable, and it will be formed in the next or 2 weeks maximum. Being a technically bearish formation, will it affect the price negatively and restore the bearish trend long-term?\u201d the analyst posed.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin\u2019s previous attempts to hit death cross\n\nIt is worth noting a death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend. Therefore, TradingShot observed that historically, every time Bitcoin surged by over 50% after hitting the one-week 200-day moving average, it represented a BTC price bottom apart from the January to March 2015 rise. Indeed, Bitcoin is up by about 50% from the November 2022 lows.\n\nConsequently, in a tweet on January 24, crypto trader and analyst by the pseudonym Thescalpingpro noted that Bitcoin\u2019s current movement resembles the 2015 price pump that saw BTC rally 214%. Interestingly, the rally emerged just before a death cross was about to be realized.\n\nBitcoin 2015 and 2023 rally comparison. Source: Thescalpingpro\n\nFurthermore, as Bitcoin faces a possible death cross, another crypto expert by the Twitter username Steve Courtney stated if Bitcoin realizes the one-week death cross, indicators point to a possible one-day golden cross before.\n\nBitcoin death cross and golden cross chart. Source: Steve Courtney\n\nNotably, the death cross technical indicator is a significant shift in the market and could signal a prolonged period of decline for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAlthough the death cross comes with a bearish sentiment, it is sometimes welcomed by a section of the market as it offers an opportunity to purchase the asset at discounted prices.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin\u2019s momentum toward $23,000 appears to have cooled down with minor corrections. The asset is valued at $22,599 with 24 hours losses of over 1%.\n\nBitcoin one-day price chart.

Oscillators are neutral at 7.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nIn the meantime, the focus turns to Bitcoin\u2019s support level of $22,500.

        "content": "For a long time, China has had a complicated relationship with the cryptocurrency industry, its government indecisive on the policies that have ranged from a total ban to investigating the utility of blockchain. Most recently, some local authorities have started to impose a hefty income tax on crypto.\n\nSpecifically, a number of crypto whales, miners, and other investors have said they were being audited by their local tax departments over personal income tax, starting in early 2022 and still awaiting the results, Colin Wu reported on January 25.\n\nAccording to the report, this represents the implementation of a 20% personal income tax on investment profits or individual cryptocurrency investors and many Bitcoin (BTC) miners after several major domestic exchanges handed to the tax authorities extensive information about some of the whales\u2019 transactions.\n\nDiffering stance on digital assets\n\nAlthough this practice would imply that the Chinese government may have finally recognized the legal status of cryptocurrencies, the reality is more complex, with tax authorities and financial authorities having differing views on the legality of crypto.\n\nIn October 2021, China Tax News, a subsidiary of the State Administration of Taxation, published an article stating that the services previously provided by overseas exchanges to Chinese residents were \u201cnot expressly prohibited by law\u201d, but imposing VAT, enterprise income tax, stamp duty, and other related taxes on the income they obtain from China.\n\nAt the same time, China has strict constraints on illegal financial activities in the form of digital currencies, but, within its current legal framework, it doesn\u2019t prohibit individuals from holding the likes of Bitcoin, with the trading of virtual currencies defined as an \u201cinvalid civil act\u201d, but not explicitly prohibited by law.\n\nOn the other hand, an article in the China Public Prosecutor\u2019s Journal from November 2022, highlighted that the government had tightened its oversight of digital assets such as Bitcoin in recent years, citing substantial financial risks associated with them.\n\nThe taxation department has its own basis for taxation, according to a senior tax professional, as tax audits on whales have become stricter, and the tax authorities have recently launched investigations of the overseas income of high-net-worth individuals.\n\nChina\u2019s complex crypto connection\n\nMore than nine years ago, China started to restrict the use of cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin, by the country\u2019s banks, but it has since unwittingly become a silent crypto whale, in part thanks to its restrictive measures, and has ranked as one of the top ten countries in crypto adoption.\n\nInterestingly, the FTX bankruptcy filing has recently also revealed that mainland China accounted for the third highest share of customers of the crypto exchange, right after island tax havens such as the Caymans and the Virgin Islands.\n\nIn fact, China\u2019s crypto possessions, the result of confiscating a large amount of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) from the Plus Token scheme in 2019, are so massive, that the country could tear down the entire crypto market in seconds if it chose to."

Although Bitcoin has largely traded in the green zone since the start of the year, it remains to be seen if the maiden crypto can extend its gains or if the bull run will be invalidated.\n\nThe uncertainty around Bitcoin stems from the fact that the crypto sector has yet to fully recover from the prevailing factors that dominated last year\u2019s bear market. However, Bitcoincenter\u2019s rainbow price chart suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s current bull run may be just beginning, and investors could see the price of BTC continue to rise in the coming months.\n\nAs of January 25, the Bitcoin rainbow chart indicates that BTC is in the \u2018Buy\u2019 zone after previously consolidating in the \u2018Basically a Fire Sale\u2019 area. Notably, the trajectory mirrors a historical trend last observed in March 2020 amid the onset of the pandemic.\n\nBitcoin Rainbow chart.

The indicator deploys color bands that follow a logarithmic regression and reviews historical Bitcoin price performance to provide a potential insight into its long-term movements.\n\nBitcoin was trading below $6,000 when it exited the \u2018Basically a Fire Sale\u2019 in March 2020. The exit triggered a Bitcoin price bottom that pushed the asset to rally toward the 2021 bull run, culminating in BTC hitting an all-time high of almost $69,000.\n\nBitcoin bearish indicators\n\nEven as the rainbow indicator points to a bullish Bitcoin future, a previous report indicated that the largest crypto by market capitalization\u2019s ongoing rally could face a correction. Specifically, Bitcoin technical analysis suggests the asset could face a potential first-ever death cross scenario that spells bearish fortunes for the crypto.\n\nAt the same time, as reported by Finbold, a panel of fintech and crypto specialists maintains that Bitcoin\u2019s value is poised to increase in 2023. The 56 specialists projected that Bitcoin might peak at around $29,095 in 2023 and finish the year at $26,844.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nElsewhere, Bitcoin is still attempting to reclaim the $23,000 as the position continues to act as a key resistance level.
