        "title": "Coinbase Is The Real Winner in the Bitcoin ETF Race - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In the last month, a wave of major financial institutions have applied to offer spot Bitcoin (BTC -0.18%) exchange-traded funds (ETF) in a bid to bridge Wall Street with the original cryptocurrency. BlackRock (BLK -0.43%) made headlines on June 15 as the first firm to submit an application, followed by Fidelity, Ark Invest, Invesco, WisdomTree, and VanEck, all vying for a piece of the Bitcoin ETF market.\n\nWhile the potential benefits for Bitcoin itself seem obvious, there is another player that stands to gain significantly from this race: Coinbase Global (COIN -1.72%).\n\nThe current situation\n\nAfter receiving the applications, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wasted no time in reviewing them and promptly sent them back for revisions, deeming them \"inadequate.\" The main issue it identified was a lack of clarity on how the firms would minimize fraud and market manipulation, a key concern for the agency.\n\nIn response to the SEC's feedback, each of the six firms expeditiously refiled their applications and tapped Coinbase as the partner for a shared surveillance agreement. By adding measures to monitor potential market manipulation, Coinbase will play a crucial role in enhancing market integrity and providing the necessary oversight asked for by the government.\n\nTaking on a bigger role\n\nCoinbase's integral role in these applications is a testament to its position as a leader in the cryptocurrency industry. But the true opportunity for Coinbase lies not only in its surveillance capabilities but also in the additional services it will provide to the proposed fund issuers.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Coinbase is expected to perform various functions for these firms, including custodial services and acting as a trading platform to buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nIn fact, both Ark Invest and BlackRock have tapped Coinbase for their custodial services. BlackRock explicitly states in its SEC filing that it will use Coinbase Prime, a product tailored for institutional investors, as the platform for its Bitcoin transactions.\n\nA lucrative opportunity\n\nTransaction fees and custodial services have historically contributed around 10% of Coinbase's quarterly revenue, but now that the platform might serve as a custodian and a brokerage with some of the biggest names on Wall Street, introduction of the Bitcoin ETFs could significantly bolster profits.\n\nTo understand the full scope of how much capital could be involved, we can take a look at the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC 3.00%), a popular product that provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin but one plagued with limitations such as inaccurate price tracking, a shortcoming that a spot ETF can remedy.\n\nAs of today, Grayscale holds more than 625,000 Bitcoins to back its Bitcoin Trust, totaling more than $19 billion. Assuming Coinbase hasn't changed its pricing structure since 2021 and still charges a 0.1% fee on custodial accounts, if it were to hold close to the same number of Bitcoins as the Grayscale Trust, the potential revenue from fees could amount to approximately $190 million based on recent Bitcoin prices. With net revenue from the first quarter of 2023 totaling $736 million, a boost in custodial fees of this size could increase Coinbase's bottom line by roughly 25%.\n\nAdding to the profitability of custodial services, Coinbase is in line to also benefit from transaction fees. A unique feature of the new spot ETF applications is that the firms will be able to buy and sell Bitcoin on a daily basis, a feature not currently present with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. (This explains why it goes through bouts of trading at premiums or discounts relative to Bitcoin's actual price.)\n\nWith this added functionality, firms like BlackRock will be conducting a multitude of large transactions on a near-daily basis to help the ETF track Bitcoin's price more accurately, potentially adding a significant boost to Coinbase's revenue.\n\nSome necessary context\n\nDespite Coinbase's ongoing lawsuit involving the SEC, the momentum and common theme among all the ETF applications should be viewed as a vote of confidence from some of Wall Street's biggest players looking to do business with the company regardless of the SEC suit.\n\nAlthough no ETF has been approved yet, the SEC's blessing looks more likely by the day. Even better, Coinbase shares still remain down more than 75% from their all-time high.\n\nFor investors seeking exposure to the crypto industry's continued growth and a potential SEC approval of the United States' first spot Bitcoin ETF, Coinbase could be a compelling long-term opportunity at current prices."

After the loan has been received, users will have the flexibility to utilize the funds as needed, as well as adjust the collateral by adding or withdrawing based on their circumstances or individual requirements.\n\n\"Bitget's new product highlights the flexibility of collateralized currency usage, enhancing capital utilization. Users now have the opportunity to stake less-demanded coins, enabling them to obtain loans in more liquid assets for investment purposes. Our platform's flexible borrowing and repayment mechanism is designed to cater to the needs of all users, accommodating their requests and ensuring convenience,\" Gracy Chen, Managing Director of Bitget.\n\nThe platform also stresses the support for withdrawals and the swift review process on loan applications as selling points for the new product.

When miners successfully add a new block, they are rewarded with a certain number of newly minted Bitcoins.\n\nIn addition to the block subsidy, miners also earn transaction fees, which are paid by users who initiate BTC transactions. According to information retrieved from TheBlock, Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy dropped by 6% between May and June.\n\nDuring the same period, revenue earned by miners on the Bitcoin network from transaction fees paid to use the blockchain also declined by 15%. In the current month, miners have accumulated $173 million in revenue from inflation rewards, while their earnings from transaction fees over the past seven days have reached $177 million.\n\nWhile miner revenue fell between May and June, BTC on-chain transaction volume rallied. Per data from TheBlock, this increased by 24% during that period.\n\nInterestingly, while the total value of transactions conducted on the BTC network went up between May and June, BTC transactions count fell by 25%.\n\nBTC remains tightly positioned\n\nAfter breaching the $31,000 price point briefly on 23 June, BTC\u2019s price has since traded within a narrow range, maintaining the psychological $30,000 price region as support. At press time, the number one cryptocurrency exchanged hands at $30,212.56, logging a 50% drop in trading volume in the last 24 hours, per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nAn assessment of BTC\u2019s price movements on a daily chart revealed that a new bear cycle was underway. On 6 July, the short-term moving average of BTC\u2019s MACD indicator crossed below the long-term moving average, signaling a potential shift towards bearish momentum.\n\nThis occurrence is often interpreted as a sell signal by traders and investors. Thus, it indicated a potential downtrend in an asset\u2019s price.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nMoreso, key momentum indicators trended downwards at press time and have been so since the beginning of the month. This showed that while BTC\u2019s price lingers in a narrow price range, buying momentum has fallen.\n\nDespite all this, buyers remained solidly in control of the BTC market. A look at the asset\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI) showed the buyer\u2019s strength (green) at 25.48, resting above the sellers\u2019 (red) at 14.50."

This case is only a part of what came to be known as the bitcoin scam during the BJP regime, involving hacking cryptocurrency exchanges, online poker sites and government portals. The chargesheet has been filed even as the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government has set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to reinvestigate the scam. After siphoning funds from the government portal, Sriki and his associates allegedly converted them into bitcoins to peddle drugs. When the Bengaluru police apprehended Sriki in November 2020, in a case involving the hacking of a gaming website, little did they know that his arrest would turn out to be the biggest political nightmare for the BJP government. A year later, Sriki\u2019s alleged crimes came back to haunt the Basavaraj Bommai government. Bommai was the home minister when Sriki was first arrested. A full-fledged political slugfest had broken out with both the ruling and opposition parties accusing the other of benefiting from the proceeds of Sriki's crimes.

This is reducing some of the optimism surrounding ongoing Bitcoin ETF applications by major Wall Street names, including BlackRock.\n\nCryptos fall as ETF hype cools\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.32% over the last 24 hours to US$30,157 at 07:40 a.m. in Hong Kong to post a weekly loss of 1.33%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency traded in the lower US$30,000 range over the weekend.\n\nEther edged 0.09% lower to US$1,862 and lost 3.71% for the week.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also logged losses in the past 24 hours. The exception was Polygon\u2019s Matic token, which gained 1.15% to US$0.6876. It added 1.07% over the past seven days.\n\nWhile multiple Bitcoin ETF applications in the past month have stirred optimism in the crypto market, their approval may not prove as transformational as some Bitcoin advocates expect, claimed a JP Morgan report on Friday. Similar products have existed in Canada and Europe but received limited inflows, the report suggests.\n\nDespite this element of doubt creeping in, Bitcoin whales remain bullish on the token. Blockchain data tracker Santiment noted in a tweet on Sunday that addresses holding 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin had added a further 71,000 Bitcoin totalling approximately US$2.15 billion since July 17.\n\n\ud83e\udd88\ud83d\udc33 #Bitcoin's sharks and whales aren't showing any signs of slowing down, even with prices beginning to get \"boring\" in this $30k to $31k range. Since June 17th, 10 to 10k $BTC addresses have accumulated 71k more coins, equating to $2.15 billion. https://t.co/poBVnszbZY pic.twitter.com/XxYsHWCFRL \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 8, 2023\n\n\u201cInvestors sentiment seems to \u2014 still \u2014 be slightly bolstered by Blackrock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink\u2019s comment and the prospect that such an openness to the asset class increases the chances of a spot BTC ETF,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market-maker Keyrock.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that while far off, the pile up of ETF applications hints at the fact that, eventually, we will see one and, once we do, other ETFs like an ETH-denominated one might see the light of day,\u201d d\u2019Anethan added.\n\nCrypto exchange BingX announced on Saturday it would support Polygon blockchain\u2019s Indore upgrade, which it said would improve the performance of the Polygon network. The move is likely to take effect from July 11.\n\nFounded in 2018 and headquartered in Singapore, BingX said it provides services in over 100 countries and regions, with over 5 million users, according to the press release.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap was unchanged in the past 24 hours at US$1.18 trillion, while crypto trading volume dipped 0.22% to US$19.74 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nDead cat bounce for NFT collections\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.73% in the 24 hours to 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,756.26, down 0.97% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Polygon and Cardano NFT market indices also logged drops, while Solana\u2019s index inched higher.\n\n\u201cOver the past few days the NFT market buyers and farmers have found some value in NFT collections that had hit all-time low floor prices,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nThe world\u2019s leading NFT marketplace Blur launched its version 2 trading platform last Thursday. This introduced a new \u201ctrait bidding\u201d feature that allows traders to bid on specific NFT traits rather than collections and receive Blur reward points.\n\n\u201cBlur\u2019s new trait offers are possibly taking pressure off of floor NFT farming,\u201d said Petscher. This could potentially lead to more price stability for Ethereum NFT projects, he added.\n\nThe floor prices of major Ethereum-based NFT collections Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Azuki and HV-MTL have all logged two-digit gains in the past seven days. However, all three are still down at least 25% for the month, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\n\u201cThe sentiment in the NFT community is that [a number of collections] likely won\u2019t recover and that this is a dead cat bounce. I expect prices to continue to bleed out until these collections find floors in the low few hundred dollar range,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 10.37% to US$26.49 million as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Cryptoslam data. The volume on the Ethereum blockchain edged up 1.39% to US$14.89 million, while Bitcoin volume jumped 87.65% to US$6.76 million.\n\nU.S. equities down amid rate hike concerns\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 11:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CNN. The three major U.S. indexes also closed lower on regular session trading Friday and logged losses for the week.\n\nMeanwhile, most main stock indexes across Asia are mixed on Monday, with China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng edging up. South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei posted losses.\n\nThe U.S. employment situation summary by the Labor Department on Friday showed the economy added 209,000 jobs in June. That is the smallest monthly increase in the past two and a half years and lower than Reuters\u2019 expectation of 225,000.\n\nHowever, wage increases and a drop in the unemployment rate indicate that the labor market is still tight. That may pave the way for further monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve within the year.\n\nThe U.S. interest rate currently sits between 5% and 5.25%. However, the CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 92.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase at the Fed\u2019s meeting on July 26. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is at just 7.6%.\n\nAnalysts also give a 35.2% chance that the Fed will raise the rate by another 25 basis points in November, up from 9.5% a month ago.\n\nAll eyes are now on the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) ahead of its release on Wednesday. The index will give investors more insight into U.S. inflation and the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\nAnalysts currently expect the annual inflation rate to drop to 3.1% in June, down from 4% in the previous month, as reported by Bloomberg on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the country\u2019s own CPI posted no annual increase in June. That is the weakest monthly showing since a drop in February 2021. The results point to a weakening recovery in the country\u2019s post-Covid economy. Further weakening may lead to calls for increased economic stimulus measures.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "Nonfarm payrolls rose by 209,000 in June, below economists\u2019 expectations of an addition of 240,000 jobs. Although the figures show a cooling labor market, market observers remained concerned as the average hourly earnings growth held steady at 0.4% from May and 4.4% from a year ago.\n\nThe report did not alter expectations of a 25 basis point rate hike by the United States Federal Reserve in the next meeting, according to the FedWatch Tool. That kept the U.S. equities markets under pressure, with all three major indices falling for the week. The S&P 500 was down 1.16% and the Nasdaq was lower by 0.92%.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAnother minor negative for the crypto markets was a report by JPMorgan managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, which said that a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) may not prove to be a game changer for the crypto space. Panigirtzoglou cites lackluster interest in the spot Bitcoin ETFs in Canada and Europe as the reason for a possible low impact even in the U.S.\n\nCould bulls regroup and kick Bitcoin above the overhead resistance? If they do, select altcoins could join the march higher. Let\u2019s analyze the charts of top-5 cryptocurrencies that are showing signs of moving up.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin remains stuck between the 20-day exponential moving average ($29,854) and the overhead resistance at $31,000. This suggests uncertainty among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe BTC/USDT pair bounced off the 20-day EMA on July 7, indicating that the bulls continue to defend the level aggressively. Buyers will again attempt to overcome the resistance at $31,500. If they succeed, the pair may start the next leg of the uptrend. The pair could first advance to $32,400 and thereafter sprint toward $40,000.\n\nThe bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to protect the overhead resistance and tug the price below the $29,500 support. If this level gives way, stops of several short-term bulls may be hit. That could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($28,101).\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair is trading between $29,500 and $31,500. Generally, a tight range trading is followed by a range expansion, but it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty. Hence, it is better to wait for the price to escape the range before waging large bets.\n\nIf the price breaks above the 50-SMA, the bulls will try to drive the pair above $31,500. If they manage to do that, the pair may start a new up-move. Conversely, a tumble below $29,500 could start a correction toward $27,500.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nSolana (SOL) has been trading in a large range between $15.28 and $27.12 for the past several months. The failure to sustain the price below the support of the range started an up-move that has risen above the downtrend line. This suggests that the bulls are attempting a comeback.\n\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. There is a minor resistance at $22 but if this level is crossed, the SOL/USDT pair may rally to $24 and ultimately to the stiff overhead resistance of $27.12.\n\nOn the downside, $18.70 is the important support to keep an eye on. A break and close below this level may open the doors for a possible drop to the strong support zone between $16.18 and $15.28.\n\nSOL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is in positive territory on the four-hour chart. This suggests that the bulls are in command. However, the bears have not yet given up and have pulled the price to the 20-EMA.\n\nIf the price rebounds off the 20-EMA with strength, the bulls will make one more attempt to overcome the obstacle at $22. If they can pull it off, the pair may jump toward $24.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a drop below the 20-EMA. That will indicate profit-booking by the short-term bulls. The pair may then slide to the 50-SMA.\n\nAvalanche price analysis\n\nAfter struggling near the 50-day SMA ($12.99) for several days, Avalanche (AVAX) successfully scaled the level on July 8.\n\nAVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages are close to completing a bullish crossover and the RSI has jumped into the positive territory. This suggests that bulls have an edge. The AVAX/USDT pair could rise to $16 where the bears may again mount a strong defense.\n\nIf subsequent corrections find support at the 20-day EMA ($13), it will suggest the start of an up-move toward $18. The important support to watch on the downside is $12. A break below this level may drag the price to the vital support at $10.52.\n\nAVAX/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows the price has risen above the symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating that bulls are trying to take charge. The up-move may face selling near the stiff overhead resistance of $15, but bulls are expected to buy the dips to the 20-EMA. If this support holds, the likelihood of a rally above $15 increases.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly yank the price below the moving averages. That may trap the aggressive bulls, resulting in long liquidation. The pair may then slide to the support line of the triangle.\n\nRelated: BlackRock ETF stirs US Bitcoin buying as research says 'get off zero'\n\nFilecoin price analysis\n\nFilecoin (FIL) is trying to form an inverse head and shoulders pattern which will complete on a break and close above the neckline near $5.\n\nFIL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages are about to complete a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory. This indicates that bulls have a slight edge. The bulls will try to drive the price to the neckline of the reversal pattern. If bulls overcome this barrier, the FIL/USDT pair may start a new up-move. The pattern target of this bullish setup is $7.30.\n\nThis positive view could invalidate in the short term if the price breaks and sustains below the moving averages. That could sink the pair to $3.5 and later to $3.\n\nFIL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair is in a corrective phase, but the buyers are trying to push the price above the moving averages. If they manage to do that, it will suggest that the correction may be over. The pair may then gradually climb toward the overhead resistance near $5.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down from the moving averages and plummets below $4.20, it will suggest that the short-term sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. That may pull the price to $4 and subsequently to $3.60.\n\nEOS price analysis\n\nEOS (EOS) has been forming a higher high and higher low pattern, suggesting a potential trend change in the near term.\n\nEOS/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($0.73) has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. Buyers will have to propel the price above the overhead resistance at $0.79 to indicate that the downtrend may be ending. The EOS/USDT pair could then surge toward $0.93.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will suggest that bears remain active at higher levels. That could keep the pair range-bound between $0.60 and $0.79 for some more time.\n\nEOS/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair has been gradually moving up. If buyers kick the price above the 50-SMA, the pair may retest the overhead resistance at $0.79. If bulls overcome this barrier, the pair could soar to $0.83 and eventually to $0.90.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the uptrend line, it will suggest that the bears are back in the driver\u2019s seat. The pair may then slump to $0.67 and later to $0.64.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "This Week in Coins: Solana Surges as Bitcoin and Ethereum Rally Rebound - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nEchoing last week, the values of market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum remained pretty inert over the past seven days.\n\nNonetheless, market leader Bitcoin (BTC) hit a one-year high after crossing the $31,000 threshold on Monday on news that the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, was refiling its application to the SEC for a Bitcoin spot ETF\u2014a regulated investment vehicle that, if approved, would provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin without the dangers of buying it directly.\n\nThe SEC expressed misgivings about BlackRock\u2019s first filing last month, stating broadly that none of the many applicants for a Bitcoin spot ETF have been specific enough about how they'll integrate a \"surveillance-sharing agreement\" to deter fraud and manipulation. Such an agreement would allow applicants to monitor market trading activity and clearing activity and verify customer identity.\n\nBlackRock named Coinbase as its market surveillance partner in its refiling. Two days later, the crypto-focused asset manager Valkyrie also refiled its ETF application and, echoing BlackRock, it named Coinbase as its market surveillance partner.\n\nIn another bullish sign for Bitcoin fans, the crypto ATM operator Bitcoin Depot became the first company of its kind to be publicly listed on the NASDAQ on Monday.\n\nHowever, the headlines weren\u2019t enough to turn Bitcoin\u2019s upward price movement into a sustained rally. The biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped back under $31,000 on Tuesday, then briefly recrossed the threshold early on Thursday before bottoming out at $30,153.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s volatility settled down by the weekend. It currently changes hands at $30,252\u2014about one percent lower than it was this time last week.\n\nEthereum (ETH) holders suffered marginally greater losses. The second biggest cryptocurrency in the world dropped in value 2.8% to enter the weekend at $1,861. It moved in step with Bitcoin, posting intraweek highs of close to $2,000 on Monday and Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe prices of most of the top thirty cryptocurrencies remained flat over the last seven days. The biggest growth was observed in Solana (SOL), which exploded 20% to hit $22.85 by Saturday, up nearly 20% for the week.\n\nRemarkably, Solana thrived in spite of news that popular trading app Revolut is delisting it\u2014along with Polygon (MATIC) and Cardano (ADA)\u2014after they were named as securities by the SEC in its ongoing lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.\n\nBig losses were felt by holders of Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The former dropped 11% to $98, while the latter dropped 12.5% to $19.06.\n\nEthereum forked from Ethereum Classic in 2016 after an infamous DAO smart contract hack enabled thieves to abscond with $55 million in ETH. The Ethereum community voted to have the illicit transactions wiped from the blockchain and continued under the name Ethereum. The original ledger recording these transactions continued as Ethereum Classic.\n\nRegulation in Asia and the UK\n\nOn Monday, Singapore announced two new consumer protection measures as the island nation\u2019s regulators continued to build a regulatory framework for its burgeoning crypto industry.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\u2014the country\u2019s chief financial regulator\u2014will enforce a ban on lending and staking for retail customers (individual traders, as opposed to institutional clients).\n\nThe MAS now also requires that exchanges move customers\u2019 digital assets into a trust before the end of the year to prevent an FTX-style scenario where their funds are commingled or traded.\n\nCoincidentally, Thailand\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission also announced a ban on \u201cdepository services that offer returns to depositors and lenders,\u201d thus outright banning exchanges from offering both lending and staking services.\n\nOn the other side of the globe on Tuesday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for the United Kingdom announced that companies promoting cryptocurrencies to UK customers must get ready to comply with the regulator\u2019s financial promotion regime before October 8, 2023.\n\nThe rules govern all communications that can be regarded as \u201cfinancial promotion,\u201d including websites, social media posts, mobile apps, and online advertising. Crypto companies will need to register with the FCA to get authorization and, if approved, they\u2019ll also need to pay a fee."

Under Fink, BlackRock has attempted to launch a spot BTC ETF with crypto exchange Coinbase acting as a surveillance partner. It\u2019s unclear if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the investment vehicle, given its track record of rejecting all previously filed spot BTC ETF applications to date.\n\nGemini files lawsuit against Digital Currency Group and Barry Silbert over Genesis and Earn program\n\nGemini has announced legal action against the conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its CEO, Barry Silbert, claiming \u201cfraud against creditors.\u201d Genesis, a DCG subsidiary, had been the crypto lender responsible for operating an Earn program in partnership with the crypto exchange. The suit follows an open letter published by Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss, which slammed Silbert for allegedly trying to play the victim card while owing over a billion dollars to Earn\u2019s investors. \u201cNot even Sam Bankman-Fried was capable of such delusion,\u201d Winklevoss wrote in the letter.\n\nBitcoin bull run incoming: Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao reveals when\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao has delivered his prediction for the next Bitcoin bull market. In a July 5 \u201cask me anything\u201d session on Twitter, CZ gave his thoughts on the next bull run, explaining that the price of Bitcoin has historically moved in four-year bull cycles, and his best bet was that this would continue to occur. While admitting he couldn\u2019t predict the future, Zhao emphasized the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024 and declared 2025 to be the most likely year for the next bull market, stating: \u201cThe year after Bitcoin halving is usually the bull year.\u201c\n\nUK government moves forward on bill aimed at empowering authorities to seize crypto\n\nLawmakers in the United Kingdom are moving forward with legislation aimed at expanding authorities\u2019 ability to target cryptocurrencies used for illicit purposes. A June 27 version of the bill included provisions to allow authorities greater flexibility in the confiscation and civil recovery of crypto assets. In addition, the legislation clarified the government\u2019s authority over digital assets \u201cintended to be used for the purposes of terrorism\u201d or related reasons. The lawmakers will consider all amendments to the bill before it can be made law by royal assent.\n\nBinance, Coinbase and Gemini staff are among the least happy, data suggests\n\nAccording to a quadrant chart by tech recruitment firm TrueUp using data from Glassdoor, crypto exchanges, including Gemini, Binance and Coinbase, are home to some of the least happy employees in the industry. The chart shows the happiest and least happy workers across over 27 of most valuable crypto firms on different stages of maturity. The defunct crypto lender Celsius, crypto exchange Gemini and trading firm Amber Group top the list of least satisfied employees, followed by Binance and Coinbase. Binance said its \u201chardcore\u201d work culture could explain some of the results, while Crypto Recruit founder Neil Dundon warned that the data should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $30,321, Ether (ETH) at $1,868 and XRP at $0.46. The total market cap is at $1.18 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAmong the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) at 40.88%, Maker (MKR) at 12.94% and Flow (FLOW) at 11.73%.\n\nThe top three altcoin losers of the week are ApeCoin (APE) at -15.13%, Stellar (XLM) at -13.31% and Fantom (FTM) at -12.63%.\n\n\n\nFor more info on crypto prices, make sure to read Cointelegraph\u2019s market analysis.\n\nMost Memorable Quotations\n\n\n\n\u201cThe year after Bitcoin halving is usually the bull year.\u201c\n\nChangpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance\n\n\u201cDecentralized perpetuals and futures trading is much newer, so there is a high growth opportunity to be had with on-chain derivatives.\u201d\n\nHenrik Andersson, chief investment officer at Apollo Crypto\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Bitcoin is an international asset.\u201d\n\nLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock\n\n\u201cThe future tells me that we are going toward augmented intelligence that will end up with AI co-mingling with normal brains.

        "content": "Bitcoin to benefit from AI courtesy of Lightning Labs\u2019 new AI tools.\n\nBTC dipped slightly after accumulation slowed down in the last few days, followed by some profit-taking.\n\nArtificial intelligence\u2019s popularity this year has somewhat stolen some of Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] thunder. Most of the attention that Bitcoin previously held has shifted to AI, and the same goes for potential liquidity. But what if Bitcoin could also benefit from AI integration?\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nThe Lightning network might just be headed down the path of embracing AI. Lightning Labs, the company behind it, announced the launch of new AI tools. They are reportedly designed to help developers create Bitcoin AI-powered products.\n\nIn other words, the Lightning network might be about to tap into AI to derive more efficiency from Bitcoin.\n\nAnnouncing a new set of tools to build Lightning\u26a1and #bitcoin-powered AI products for a global audience. Using L402, a standard for API authentication with LN payments, and @langchainAI, a simplified AI app framework, we are opening up #AI4All! ??https://t.co/EQseanCurv \u2014 Lightning Labs\u26a1\ufe0f? (@lightning) July 6, 2023\n\nOne of the biggest questions regarding this development is how Bitcoin will benefit from AI. According to the official announcement, the tools can create advanced functionalities within the Lightning network. This includes the development of a new authentication mechanism, or perhaps boosting network performance.\n\nPerhaps one of the best use cases for the new AI tools for the Lightning network is that it may facilitate Bitcoin use in the Internet of Things (IOT). If cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin will become embedded in the future of commerce, then it makes sense to develop AI-powered tools. Bitcoin interaction with AI tools is perhaps another reason why developers should consider AI integration with blockchain.\n\nWill the development encourage more adoption?\n\nThe aforementioned benefits might just represent a fraction of the advantages of integrating Bitcoin with AI. More advantages might be unlocked in the future, but before that, consider this. We have already seen that most top companies are adopting AI to boost productivity.\n\nThus, Lightning\u2019s integration with AI could also allow Bitcoin to maintain its competitive advantages.\n\nBTC price action recap\n\nThe advantages may not be immediately felt, but could have a significant impact on Bitcoin in the future. The cryptocurrency\u2019s press time situation underscored the return of sell pressure after failing to push above the $31,419 price level.\n\nThe king coin exchanged hands at $30,181 at the time of writing.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nWill Bitcoin slip below $30,000 once again? So far, the coin\u2019s MFI reveals that there have been significant outflows in the last few days. However, a price tag below the $30,000 range is easily achievable if sell pressure continues to build up.\n\nThe right FUD-inducing news could send the king coin even lower. On the other hand, investors should also look out for more accumulation supported by positive developments."

        "title": "Experts warn 2024 Bitcoin halving to spell 'death knell' for crypto miners - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) halving is among the most anticipated events in the cryptocurrency space, with the potential to help the maiden digital asset price rally to new heights. Indeed, previous halvings have partly contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s rally to record valuations, and the upcoming 2024 event carries similar expectations.\n\nAlthough the halving could spell good fortunes for Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market in terms of price, the event is also projected to sound the \u2018death knell for certain\u2019 miners, Bloomberg reported on July 8.\n\nNotably, concerns about the mining economics leading up to the next halving have emerged. In this line, Jaran Mellerud, a crypto-mining analyst at Hashrate Index, predicts that the higher costs of the process will impact most miners.\n\n\u201cNearly half of the miners will suffer given they have less efficient mining operations with higher costs,\u201d said Mellerud.\n\nFor instance, he indicated that the break-even electricity price for the primary mining machine is predicted to decrease from 12 cents/kWh to six cents/kWh after the halving. Mellerud added that around 40% of miners have operating costs exceeding this threshold, and miners with costs above 8 cents/kWh and smaller miners who outsource their rigs will face difficulties staying profitable.\n\n\u201cIf you count in everything, the total cost for certain miners is well above Bitcoin\u2019s current price.<\u2026> Net profits will turn negative for many miners with less efficient operations,\u201d said Wolfie Zhao, head of research at TheMinerMag, a research arm of mining consultancy BlocksBridge.\n\nRising mining debt\n\nThe concerns come at a time the Bitcoin mining industry is operating in debt partly due to last year\u2019s extended bear market and increased electricity costs. According to Ethan Vera, COO of Luxor Technologies, the global mining industry currently holds a debt ranging from $4.5 billion to $6 billion, a decrease from $8 billion in 2022. This debt includes senior debt, loans secured by mining rigs, and Bitcoin-backed loans.\n\nNotably, miners migrating from China to North America after the domestic mining ban in 2021 led to increased borrowing. Access to the capital market was limited for miners, making debt financing more readily available in the US, according to Zhao.\n\nAt the same time, rising competition among Bitcoin miners has reduced profit margins. Bitcoin miners are also proactively safeguarding themselves in anticipation of the halving.\n\nPreparation for halving\n\nThe miners are implementing strategies like locking in power prices, strengthening their financial reserves, and reducing investment activities. Despite the preparation, Texas-based Bitcoin miner Lotta Yotta CEO Tiffany Wang believes several operators will still be wiped out.\n\n\u201cDuring the halving year, it is high risk. <\u2026> It is better to save some fund in the account to keep the company running. <\u2026> Everyone has to be prepared. Unfortunately, a lot of miners will eventually be driven out of the market,\u201d said Wang.\n\nIt is worth noting that amid the concerns, in June, mining difficulty reached a record high, and maintaining profit margins after the halving, Bitcoin\u2019s price would need to reach $50,000-$60,000 next year."

        "title": "How to Take Advantage of Ethereum Flippening Bitcoin in the Next Bullrun - Cryptopolitan",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is filled with excitement and speculation as investors and enthusiasts eagerly await the next bull run. Within this context, the concept of \u201cFlippening\u201d has garnered significant attention. The Flippening refers to the hypothetical event in which Ethereum (ETH) surpasses Bitcoin (BTC) as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin have long been the pillars of the crypto world, capturing the imagination and investments of millions. While Bitcoin has held its dominant position since its inception, Ethereum has been steadily gaining ground, fueled by its unique features and expanding ecosystem.\n\nIn June 2017, Ethereum experienced its highest level of dominance in the crypto market, reaching 25.32%. This period coincided with the golden age of initial coin offerings (ICOs) when numerous projects launched altcoins on the Ethereum protocol.\n\nOn June 12, 2017, the market capitalization of ETH was nearly 84% of that of Bitcoin (BTC), with just $7.16 billion separating the two, as per TradingView data. Currently, that figure stands at approximately 38%, indicating a significant change in the relative market positions of ETH and BTC. A dominance level above 100% suggests a \u201cflippening,\u201d where ETH surpasses BTC in market capitalization.\n\nFlippening Metrics\n\nFlippening metrics refer to indicators used to analyze the potential shift in dominance between Ethereum and Bitcoin, specifically regarding market capitalization and other relevant factors. While market capitalization is the primary metric used to gauge the Flippening, several other metrics provide insights into this phenomenon.\n\nActive addresses\n\nActive addresses represent the unique addresses involved in sending or receiving transactions within a specific period. However, due to differences in address usage patterns between Ethereum and Bitcoin, this metric can disadvantage Ethereum, as users/ contracts frequently reuse their addresses.\n\nAccording to BlockchainCentre, the active address Flipenning is at 52%.\n\nTransaction count\n\nTransaction count is another crucial metric, measuring the total number of on-chain transactions on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks. If Ethereum surpasses Bitcoin in this metric, it indicates a higher transaction activity. Ethereum has flipenned Bitcoin on the Transaction count metric.\n\nTransactions volume\n\nTransaction volume is the total value of USD transferred over the network, explicitly comparing Ethereum transfers with Bitcoin transfers. It\u2019s important to note that Ethereum\u2019s volume may exceed 100% when considering additional token transfers, as Ethereum supports a broader range of tokens. According to BlockchainCentre, the transaction volume flipenning is at 71%.\n\nTrading volume\n\nTrading volume reflects the adjusted exchange trading volume for Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing insights into the trading activity and liquidity of the cryptocurrencies. According to BlockchainCentre, the trading volume flipenning is 65%.\n\nTotal transaction fees\n\nTotal transaction fees represent the USD value of fees paid for conducting transactions on each network. A higher percentage for Ethereum suggests that it has surpassed Bitcoin regarding transaction fee generation. According to BlockchainCentre, Ethereum has flippened Bitcoin on the value of fees paid to conduct transactions.\n\nGoogle search interest\n\nGoogle search interest measures the relative popularity of \u201cBitcoin\u201d and \u201cEthereum\u201d in search queries on Google, reflecting each cryptocurrency\u2019s public interest and awareness.\n\nAccording to BlockchainCentre, the Google search interest flipenning metric is 13%.\n\nThese metrics collectively offer a comprehensive perspective on the potential Flippening between Ethereum and Bitcoin. However, it\u2019s essential to acknowledge that various factors, including technological advancements, adoption rates, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment, influence market dynamics and cryptocurrency performance.\n\nWhile Ethereum has demonstrated significant growth and dominance in certain areas, the Flippening would indicate Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin in market capitalization, marking a shift in prominence within the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Strengths and Potential Catalysts\n\nEthereum is a formidable contender in the cryptocurrency market, driven by its unique strengths and potential catalysts that could propel it to surpass Bitcoin in the next bull run. Let\u2019s delve into the key strengths of Ethereum and explore the factors that could act as catalysts for its growth.\n\nSmart Contract Functionality and Versatility\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s greatest strengths lies in its smart contract functionality. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined conditions written into code, allowing for the automation and facilitation of transactions without intermediaries. This feature has revolutionized various industries, enabling the development of decentralized applications (DApps) and opening doors to new economic models.\n\nThe versatility of Ethereum\u2019s smart contract platform has led to the rapid growth of the DeFi ecosystem. DeFi applications built on Ethereum offer various financial services, including lending, borrowing, yield farming, and decentralized exchanges, providing users greater control over their assets and economic activities.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem has become a hotbed for innovation in DeFi and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). DeFi protocols built on Ethereum enable users to access financial services traditionally offered by centralized institutions but in a decentralized and permissionless manner. The exponential growth of the DeFi sector has attracted billions of dollars in value locked in these protocols, indicating the increasing adoption and utility of Ethereum. Liquidity in Ethereum contracts offers great utility/ functions like flash loans.\n\nSimilarly, NFTs have revolutionized digital ownership, allowing artists, creators, and collectors to tokenize and trade unique digital assets, from digital art and virtual real estate to in-game items and collectibles.\n\nWhat could kill Ethereum?\n\nTwo potential factors could pose risks to Ethereum: a core issue and an issue/exploit in an upgrade. Let\u2019s explore each of these factors in more detail:\n\nCore Issue\n\nA core issue is a fundamental problem or limitation within the Ethereum protocol. These issues could undermine the network\u2019s security, functionality, or usability, potentially leading to a loss of user confidence and adoption. Here are a few examples:\n\nSecurity Vulnerabilities: If critical security vulnerabilities are in Ethereum\u2019s core codebase, it could expose the network to attacks or exploits. These vulnerabilities might allow malicious actors to manipulate transactions, compromise user funds, or disrupt the operation of smart contracts.\n\nGovernance Challenges: Ethereum\u2019s governance model, which involves decision-making processes for protocol upgrades, can sometimes be a point of contention. If governance challenges arise and lead to significant conflicts or delays in implementing necessary improvements or upgrades, it could hinder Ethereum\u2019s progress and competitiveness.\n\nRegulatory and Legal Concerns: The evolving regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can impact Ethereum\u2019s growth and adoption. Adverse regulatory actions or legal uncertainties could create barriers to entry for users and developers, potentially stifling innovation and causing reputational damage.\n\nIssue/Exploit in an Upgrade\n\nEthereum regularly undergoes upgrades to address existing challenges and introduce new features. While these upgrades aim to enhance the network, there is always a risk of issues or vulnerabilities emerging during the implementation process. Here are a few scenarios:\n\nSmart Contract Vulnerabilities: Ethereum\u2019s upgrades often involve changes to the smart contract functionality. A critical vulnerability in a widely used smart contract language or framework could result in the exploitation of contracts and the loss of user funds. Such incidents could erode trust in Ethereum and deter users and developers from utilizing the platform.\n\nNetwork Consensus Issues: Upgrades that involve changes to the consensus mechanism or network validation process carry inherent risks. If an upgrade introduces a flaw or vulnerability in the consensus algorithm, it could lead to network disruptions, consensus failures, or even chain splits. These events can undermine the integrity of the Ethereum network and fragment the community.\n\nIncompatibility or Implementation Errors: Upgrades often involve complex technical changes and require careful implementation. If errors occur during the upgrade process or if an upgrade is incompatible with existing contracts or infrastructure, it could lead to operational issues, service disruptions, or unintended consequences that negatively impact Ethereum\u2019s functionality.\n\nEthereum developers and the broader community employ rigorous testing, auditing, and peer review processes before implementing upgrades to mitigate these risks. Additionally, test networks like Ropsten, Rinkeby, and Goerli allow testing and identifying issues in a controlled environment before deploying upgrades on the Ethereum network.\n\nIt is important to note that while these risks exist, the Ethereum community actively works to address them through ongoing research, security practices, and collaboration. The decentralized nature of Ethereum allows for continuous improvement and adaptability to emerging challenges.\n\nWhat will it take for Ethereum to flip Bitcoin?\n\nFor Ethereum to flip Bitcoin and become the dominant cryptocurrency, Ethereum would need to surpass Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization, which is the total value of all coins in circulation. As of now, Bitcoin holds a significant lead in this metric. However, if Ethereum continues to experience significant growth, adoption, and sustained investor interest, it could close the gap over time.\n\nTo achieve this fete, Ethereum would have to excel in several areas, these include:\n\nNetwork Adoption and Usage: Ethereum\u2019s network must demonstrate higher adoption and usage levels than Bitcoin. This includes factors such as the number of active addresses, transaction count, transaction volume, and trading volume. If Ethereum consistently outperforms Bitcoin in these metrics, it could signal a shift in market preference towards Ethereum.\n\nTechnological Advancements: Ethereum\u2019s technological advancements, such as scalability solutions, improved transaction speeds, and lower fees, would need to provide a competitive edge over Bitcoin. Successful implementation of these upgrades could enhance Ethereum\u2019s attractiveness relative to Bitcoin.\n\nDeFi and Smart Contracts: Ethereum\u2019s position as the leading platform for DeFi and smart contracts provides a unique advantage. Continued growth and innovation in the DeFi space and developing compelling decentralized applications (dApps) and use cases could contribute to Ethereum\u2019s overall value proposition and potentially attract more users and investors.\n\nMarket Perception and Sentiment: Market sentiment plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency adoption and investment. Ethereum must maintain a positive perception among users, developers, investors, and the broader cryptocurrency community. This includes factors such as robust community support, favorable media coverage, regulatory clarity, and overall confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability.\n\nExternal Factors: It\u2019s important to consider external factors influencing the flippening. These factors include macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, geopolitical events, technological breakthroughs, and competition from other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum must navigate these external dynamics effectively and demonstrate resilience and adaptability to emerge as the dominant cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum layer-1 competitors\n\nWhen considering layer-1 blockchains that have the potential to flip Bitcoin, it\u2019s important to note that Bitcoin\u2019s position as the leading cryptocurrency is well-established and challenging to surpass. However, several layer-1 blockchains have gained attention and could compete with Ethereum. Here are a few examples:\n\nCardano (ADA): Cardano is a blockchain platform that has gained attention for its scientific approach and commitment to peer-reviewed research. It utilizes a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for developing decentralized applications.\n\nSolana (SOL): Solana is a high-performance blockchain for decentralized applications and crypto-assets. It combines proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-history (PoH) mechanisms to achieve scalability and fast transaction speeds. Solana\u2019s architecture and growing ecosystem have attracted attention and positioned it as a potential challenger to Bitcoin.\n\nBinance Smart Chain (BSC): Binance Smart Chain is a blockchain platform developed by the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. It aims to provide a high-performance infrastructure for decentralized applications and token issuance. BSC\u2019s close integration with the Binance ecosystem and lower transaction fees than Ethereum have contributed to its rapid growth and popularity.\n\nPolkadot (DOT): Polkadot is a multi-chain platform enabling interoperability between blockchains. It offers a scalable and secure infrastructure for building decentralized applications and connecting various blockchain networks. With its focus on cross-chain communication and governance, Polkadot presents a unique value proposition and has gained attention as a potential challenger to Bitcoin.\n\nThe Open Network (TON): The Open Network (TON) is a blockchain project initially led by Telegram, aiming to create a decentralized platform for applications and fast transactions. Although Telegram exited the project in 2020, TON has seen subsequent developments and spin-offs, such as Free TON and Toncoin. These community-driven initiatives utilize the original TON codebase to explore the potential of decentralized applications and offer improved features such as encrypted messaging. While TON has undergone changes and separate entities have emerged, its core objective remains to provide a robust blockchain network for decentralized innovation and secure communication.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s programmability and smart contract capabilities have made it the preferred platform for dApps and DeFi projects, fueling its impressive growth and adoption. The vibrant Ethereum ecosystem, coupled with constant development and upgrades, positions it as a strong contender to challenge Bitcoin\u2019s dominance.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin still holds a significant advantage in market capitalization, brand recognition, and widespread acceptance as a store of value. Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply and first-mover advantage have contributed to its status as digital gold and a haven asset during uncertain times.\n\nThe crypto market is notoriously volatile and influenced by a myriad of factors. Only time will tell how these two powerhouses will evolve and shape the future of digital finance."

        "content": "Traditional finance made a bold move into crypto recently with Blackrock, Invesco, WisdomTree, and Fidelity coming after Bitcoin ETFs. Consequently, the hype around these projects has sent Bitcoin and other crypto up a few percentage points.\n\nIn this article, we explore ETFs in general and Bitcoin ETFs, in particular, to understand where all the fuss is coming from.\n\n\u2795 What are ETFs?\n\n\u2018ETF\u2019 is an acronym for exchange-traded funds. It exposes investors to an asset without the investor having to own the asset. It is designed to track the performance of a specific index, sector, commodity, or asset class. ETFs are popular among investors because they offer several advantages.\n\n???? Advantages of ETFs\n\nETFs provide diversification by holding a basket of securities, such as stocks, bonds, or commodities.\n\nThey offer liquidity as they can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices.\n\nThey have lower expense ratios (operating expenses) compared to mutual funds because they are passively managed and aim to replicate the performance of an underlying index rather than actively selecting securities.\n\nETFs can be bought and sold through brokerage accounts, just like individual stocks. Investors can choose to hold ETFs for the long term as part of their investment portfolio or engage in short-term trading strategies.\n\n\u2795 What are Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nNow that we understand what ETFs are, we can relate to Bitcoin as an asset class. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs expose retail investors to Bitcoin without then owning or trading it. The investors enjoy a convenient, diversified, and cost-effective way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, without going through the hassle of trying to understand how blockchain works.\n\nETFs are where traditional finance and the blockchain industry meet \u2013 where smart money and dumb money exchange liquidity. Bitcoin ETFs are very coveted because of how volatile the price of Bitcoin is.\n\nOver the years, the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) has used every tool in its arsenal to come after Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. However, the young industry has ever so slightly evaded these attacks.\n\nSince traditional finance is highly regulated, institutions that want to start trading Bitcoin ETFs must get a license from the relevant regulatory authorities (AKA SEC).\n\n\u2795 Why are Bitcoin ETFs a Big Thing?\n\nAs explained above, Bitcoin ETFs are where liquidity exchanges hands. Traditional investors bring their hard-earned cash to the CME and use it to buy BTC derivatives. The owner of the BTC derivatives then uses the money to buy actual Bitcoin from the market. This raises BTC\u2019s price and market cap exponentially.\n\nThis is how money flows in the crypto industry:\n\nOnce the \u2018dumb money\u2019 (Fiat) has bought Bitcoin, early BTC holders start selling BTC and buying large-cap cryptos. This pushes their prices up. In turn, those who held large caps begin selling them and buying midcaps, and so on.\n\nFinally, when the market cycle is over, the money flows back into Bitcoin from the low caps. Bitcoin, in this last phase, is just a conduit to cashing out since it is accepted by the majority of banks. By the time the fiat exits the cryptosystem, money had exchanged hands from TradFi investors to crypto investors.\n\nThis is what happened in 2017 and Bitcoin skyrocketed from $900 to $19,000. Now the market is entering a new cycle.\n\n\u2795Blackrock, Invesco, WisdomTree & Fidelity are coming after Bitcoin ETFs\n\nSince the 2017 crypto bull run, the United States has not readily approved another spot Bitcoin ETF \u2013 backed by Bitcoin. On top of that, the SEC, CTFC and other financial government agencies had been very vocal and anti-crypto.\n\nHowever, several large investment giants have filed for Bitcoin spot ETFs with the SEC. It seems like they might get approved.\n\nBefore the 2017 Bitcoin bull market kicked off, BTC was trading at around $1000 and was trudging along very slowly. Toward mid-2016, the media began to cover Bitcoin more and prices started to rise faster, by 2017, futures contracts began trading on the CME and many in the market felt like Bitcoin was becoming a genuine financial asset class.\n\nThe \u2018dumb money\u2019 finally had access to a new financial instrument with the blessing of the SEC, CFTC and mainstream media. Bitcoin flew off and hit $19,600 \u2013 a 1,349% increase.\n\nInvestment Giants\u2019 Bid to Gatekeep Bitcoin and Crypto via ETFs\n\nThis time, however, things are different because Blackrock will partner with Nasdaq in a surveillance-sharing agreement to mitigate manipulation. Moreover, the giants ganging up to control the Bitcoin market through ETFs will inadvertently bring:\n\nMainstream Adoption: ETFs are familiar investment vehicles for many investors, and the availability of a Bitcoin ETF would make it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to directly purchase and store the cryptocurrency themselves.\n\nETFs are familiar investment vehicles for many investors, and the availability of a Bitcoin ETF would make it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to directly purchase and store the cryptocurrency themselves.

Institutional Investment: Bitcoin ETFs could attract institutional investors who have been hesitant to directly invest in cryptocurrencies due to regulatory concerns, custody challenges, and compliance issues.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile there is a chance Bitcoin ETFs might not last long and are only here to temporarily drive Bitcoin price up in cycles, their approval is greatly appreciated by those in the industry. This article is meant to help you understand what ETFs are and where you lie in the ultimate exchange of liquidity. Hopefully, if you are on the wrong side you are making arrangements to be on the receiving end by learning as much as you can about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies before this bull cycle ends."
