        "title": "Bitcoin has climbed 65% this year despite crypto woes. Experts explain why. - ABC News",
        "content": "The digital currency benefited from a shift to well-known coins, experts said.\n\nBitcoin has climbed 65% this year despite crypto woes. Experts explain why.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry, in recent months, has suffered some blows: high-profile bankruptcies, the arrest of wunderkind Sam Bankman-Fried and a regulator lawsuit against top crypto exchange Binance.\n\nDespite it all, the price of the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin, has surged.\n\nBitcoin has climbed 65% this year, far surpassing the S &P 500, which has jumped 7%. Even the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, has delivered just a quarter of bitcoin's gains.\n\nIn fact, bitcoin has benefited from crises in the cryptocurrency arena, analysts said, since the unrest has pushed investors away from lesser-known coins and toward the sector's household name.\n\nPlus, the price has gained a boost from wider economic forces like trouble in the financial system and slowing interest rate hikes, they said.\n\nBut the coming months pose uncertainty, experts added, as a looming recession could test the performance of an asset less than 15 years old.\n\nThe blockbuster performance of bitcoin in 2023 comes after the digital currency's price plummeted last year. In all, the price of bitcoin fell 65% last year, exceeding the losses suffered by the S &P 500, which dropped about 20%.\n\nThe price struggles for bitcoin, which extended throughout much of the cryptocurrency sector, coincided with an aggressive series of interest rate hikes that put downward pressure on many assets, including the major stock indexes.\n\n\"There had been a big bubble,\" James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset management firm CoinShares, told ABC News. \"The bubble was pricked by the Fed.\"\n\nThe distress in cryptocurrency helped trigger a slew of failures. Last May, a major coin, Terra, collapsed along with its sister coin Luna. Meanwhile, several crypto lenders such as Block Fi, Celsius and Genesis filed for bankruptcy last year.\n\nIn dramatic fashion, crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy in November after a collapse in a matter of days that was followed by the arrest of Bankman-Fried, the company's founder and former CEO. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to all 13 counts he faces, including fraud and conspiracy.\n\nThe unrest last year sent crypto investors toward well-known digital currencies, Callie Cox, an analyst at the investment company eToro who tracks cryptocurrencies, told ABC News.\n\n\"Bitcoin has been the beneficiary of a flight to quality within the crypto industry,\" Cox said. \"This is the crypto name that my mom and your family probably know.\"\n\nButterfill, of CoinShares, echoed the point: \"People are becoming a lot more discerning. There are 50,000 crypto coins out there and a lot of them are rubbish.\"\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried leaves Manhattan federal court in New York, Feb. 16, 2023. John Minchillo/AP, FILE\n\nEthereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, has surged 52% this year, benefiting as well from the rush toward prominent coins, Butterfill said.\n\nThe rise in the price of bitcoin has coincided with favorable developments across the wider economy, since the Federal Reserve has slowed its interest rate hikes and unrest in the traditional banking sector has pushed some investors to seek a digital alternative, experts said.\n\nSince March, three of the nation's 30-largest banks have collapsed. Shares of regional lender PacWest Bancorp plummeted on Thursday after the bank said it lost 9% of deposits last week, suggesting that financial instability persists.\n\n\"When the banking system faced threats, a lot of investors saw reason to doubt the financial system,\" said Cox, of eToro. \"They went looking for alternatives.\"\n\nThere is little data available that depositors pulled money out of banks and placed it in bitcoin, Butterfill noted, adding that he had heard anecdotes of bank customers transferring funds to crypto.\n\nIf the Fed halts its rate hikes, as many investors expect, bitcoin could continue its rise over the latter part of the year, experts said. However, they cautioned that a potential recession could bring volatility.\n\n\"There might be nervousness about bitcoin as we move closer to a recession,\" Cox said, pointing out that interest rates would remain elevated even after a pause. \"There are a lot of crosswinds for crypto right now.\"\n\nButterfill acknowledged uncertainty about the outlook of day-to-day performance for bitcoin, but remained optimistic about the remainder of 2023, even if it involves a recession.\n\n\"Economic data continues to deteriorate,\" Butterfill said. \"In that environment, bitcoin would be volatile and perform quite well.\""

        "content": "A 21-year-old French citizen who bought a Ferrari with bitcoin had his 18-month sentence and $3.7 million fine upheld by a Moroccan court.\n\nThe original sentence handed down by the Casablanca Court of Appeals in October 2022 against Thomas Clausi was upheld earlier this month, his lawyer, Mohamed Aghanaj, confirmed. Clausi was arrested for buying the luxury sports car in 2021.\n\nMorocco banned holding and trading cryptocurrencies in 2017.\n\nThe enforcement actions against Clausi began when a French woman living in Casablanca sold the Ferrari in question to Clausi for a bitcoin payment worth 400,000 euros ($436,600) at the time. She filed a complaint accusing him of \u201cfraud.\u201d\n\nA Moroccan citizen submitted a separate complaint against the Frenchman, alleging Clausi signed a fraudulent check with the name of another individual \u2014 which he obtained in exchange for bitcoin \u2014 in order to buy three of the Moroccan citizen\u2019s watches.\n\nThe court ordered Clausi to repay the watch owner with 3,900 euros.\n\nWhile the full sentence was 18 months, Aghanaj said that Clausi will spend a little bit more than a month in jail to complete his sentence. With this decision against Clausi, the country appears to be sending a message to all those who have a desire to use digital assets.\n\nDespite Morocco\u2019s hard stance on crypto, its citizens seem keen on digital assets. Morocco ranks 14th in the world on crypto adoption based on five different factors, according to a 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "On the Catalyst with Shayle Kann podcast this week:\n\nDepending on who you talk to, Bitcoin mines are either great for the grid or the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to it. These warehouses of computers essentially turn electricity into bitcoins. Proponents argue that mines can do a number of things for the grid, including:\n\n\n\nSupport grid reliability by reducing demand during peak hours.\n\nIncentivize new renewable generation by raising the prices that solar and wind farms receive.\n\nReduce methane emissions by capturing flare gas from fossil fuel wells and then using that gas to generate electricity for mine operations.\n\nMeanwhile, opponents argue that the mines raise emissions and electricity prices. So how do we make sense of the great Bitcoin energy debate?\n\nIn this episode, Shayle talks to Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge at Wood Mackenzie. The New York Times recently reported on the role of Bitcoin mining on the grid, and Ben was part of a team that contributed to the report.\n\nShayle and Ben discuss:\n\n\n\nHow Bitcoin mines affect electricity prices for nearby consumers.\n\nWhether mines use only excess renewable generation or incentivize fossil-fuel generators to ramp up.\n\nWhat mines\u2019 load profiles say about their flexibility and price sensitivity, especially during peak demand.\n\nThe evidence on whether mines are signing long-term power-purchase agreements, repowering mothballed projects or otherwise helping to incentivize new renewables construction.\n\nAlternative cryptocurrencies that don\u2019t require so much electricity.\n\nRecommended resources:\n\n\n\nNYT: The Real-World Costs of the Digital Race for Bitcoin\n\nEarth Justice and The Sierra Club: The Energy Bomb: How Proof-of-Work Cryptocurrency Mining Worsens the Climate Crisis and Harms Communities Now\n\nCoinspeaker: Texas Senate Passes Bill to Limit Incentives for Crypto Miners Participating in Demand Response Programs\n\nCatalyst is a co-production of Post Script Media and Canary Media."

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM=\n\nETH.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nBitcoin. Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin traded at its lowest level since mid-March on Friday as volatility, driven by low liquidity, continued to hit cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin ended the day lower by 2.58% at 26,181.46 after briefly hitting a low of 25,833.34 the lowest level since March 17, according to Coin Metrics. The biggest crypto asset by market cap posted a weekly loss of 11.25%, making it its worst week since Nov. 11. There are a number of issues facing crypto markets right now including low liquidity, a crackdown on the industry from regulators in the U.S. and macroeconomic worries.\n\nLiquidity issues\n\nBitcoin is up around 59% this year but prices have remained volatile, with low liquidity exacerbating moves higher and lower. Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko, said there has been a \"notable drop in market depth\" for bitcoin. Market depth refers to a market's ability to absorb relatively large buy and sell orders. When market depth is low, then relatively small orders can cause the price of an asset to move up or down in a substantial way. And the liquidity situation could be set to get worse after Bloomberg reported that Jane Street and Jump Crypto, two of the biggest crypto market makers, will take a step back from crypto trading in the U.S. as the country's regulators continue their crackdown on the nascent industry.\n\n\"While it is yet unclear the catalyst for today's sharp drop, the volatility is to be expected given the current state of liquidity, especially after larger market maker Jane Street and Jump Crypto revealed they were winding down their crypto exposure,\" Medalie said. Liquidity has been a big issue for crypto markets since the closure of Silvergate and Signature Bank \u2014 two key platforms that people used to buy into the crypto market.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny, congestion issues\n\nScrutiny from U.S. regulators on the digital currency industry has ramped up since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned American crypto exchange Coinbase in March over potential securities law violations. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the company is preparing for a years-long court battle with the SEC. Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission alleged in March that crypto exchange Binance violated trading rules.\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "Tales From the Crypto Winter Some acolytes lost faith, others blamed devils\u2014and some went even harder. An essay exploring what happens when the prophecy of blockchain fails.\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne day in early 2021, my old friend George called. I always enjoyed our catch-ups. We\u2019d usually talk about dating, movies and his screenwriting career. But this time he steered the conversation toward a new topic: Bitcoin.\n\nGeorge, whose surname I\u2019m omitting to protect his privacy, seemed genuinely eager for me to learn about the cryptocurrency. He sent me podcasts featuring blockchain \u201cexperts\u201d and chart-heavy newsletters about \u201con-chain analytics.\u201d George was planning his financial future around Bitcoin, he told me, and didn\u2019t want his friends to get left behind. For a while, I ignored his appeals\u2014the whole thing seemed complicated and vaguely annoying. But as the price of Bitcoin rose, his messages became more insistent. I agreed to look into it, and after \u201cdoing my own research,\u201d i.e., half-listening to a few podcasts set on 2x speed, I decided to buy some.\n\nA series of cascading implosions caused the value of crypto to plummet last year. After that, George and I had a very different conversation. \u201cLet me issue a blanket apology here,\u201d George said. \u201cIt was the blind leading the blind.\u201d Indeed, since I\u2019d bought it, Bitcoin had lost three-quarters of its value. We were deep in what the blockchain faithful are calling crypto winter\u2014an extended downturn that has yet to thaw.\n\nFor George, apologizing to me wasn\u2019t the hardest part. He\u2019d persuaded his Chinese immigrant parents to refinance their mortgage and lend him $50,000 to invest in Bitcoin. He stored the funds on Celsius, a sort of crypto bank where they could accrue interest. The company collapsed into bankruptcy, and now the money was frozen, much of it likely lost. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m really sorry, I\u2019m deeply ashamed, and I will commit ritual seppuku if you demand it,\u2019 \u201d he says. They didn\u2019t, but he said he plans to pay them back when he can.\n\nIt seemed that George, like a lot of us who got caught up in crypto, was experiencing not just a financial loss but a kind of financial grief\u2014a tangle of guilt, second-guessing and that awful feeling of having fallen for something. Bitcoin\u2019s price has bounced back some since we spoke, but that\u2019s little comfort if you\u2019ve had your money stuck on a janky platform such as Celsius, or lost funds on Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s allegedly fraudulent FTX exchange, or held one of the now-worthless \u201caltcoins\u201d that popped up like mushrooms in a big rain during the pandemic trading boom. For many, crypto had become an identity, a way to feel smart and subversive and on the cutting edge of a new technology. What happens to that self-image when its foundation erodes? When instead of being someone\u2019s savvy son or daughter, you are the sheepish adult child who has to explain where the family savings went? (Disclosure: I haven\u2019t sold the tokens\u2014mostly Bitcoin and Ether\u2014that I bought near the top of the bull market, making me the object of delicate inquiry and gleeful mockery at family gatherings.)\n\nIt\u2019s complicated. George, despite the frauds, the constant hacks and the market\u2019s collapse, says he still has faith. \u201cI still believe blockchain is a revolutionary development,\u201d he says. \u201cIn 10, 20, 50 years, I do believe\u2014I want to believe, badly\u2014that we\u2019ll look back and say Bitcoin was an invention on the scale of the printing press or the internet.\u201d\n\nIn their seminal 1956 social psychology study, When Prophecy Fails, Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken and Stanley Schachter described how followers of a doomsday cult responded when their prophet\u2019s precise predictions of apocalypse turned out to be false: They just pushed the date back. Some became even stronger believers and proselytized more. They\u2019d already committed too much, perhaps quitting their jobs or giving away money, to accept that there was nothing to it. The study became a classic example of the \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d that occurs when evidence contradicts one\u2019s model of the world.\n\nI was curious how people in crypto were handling the dissonance. In the summer of 2021, with blockchain fervor in full swing, I wrote an article about crypto communities and found it useful to divide them into factions based on their favorite investment. There were the Bitcoin maximalists, who thought the OG token was the one true way to resist the scourges of modern finance and government; Ethereum hobbyists who regarded blockchains as a nifty Lego set for building new widgets; DeFi (decentralized finance) day traders who just gambled for the buzz. Each group came with its own values and culture. Today it feels more apt to sort people by their narratives of what the hell happened to crypto and where it all goes from here.\n\nTHE DOUBLE-DOWNERS\n\nAt a dude-heavy meet-up at a Midtown bar in New York in January, a group stood in a circle debating what had gone wrong with crypto. One guy blamed the large amount of \u201cfluff\u201d in the market, because anyone could spin a token out of nothing. Another pointed to the lack of transparency in many crypto institutions. A trader named Boris Friedman said that while people are currently \u201cfearful\u201d of crypto because of FTX, he expects the market to rebound in the next three to five years. \u201cLong term, there will be more adoption,\u201d he said.\n\nNearby, Corey Wilson, wearing two necklaces\u2014one featuring the Egyptian Eye of Ra, the other the logo for a blockchain called HEX\u2014sipped a margarita. Wilson told me that after losing funds on the crypto scam BitConnect and then making it all back and more with HEX, he still buys tokens every day. \u201cI see a higher upside now that we\u2019re in the lows of the market,\u201d he said. (HEX is down almost 90% from its peak.)\n\nWilson buys tokens every day. Photographer: Levi Mandel for Bloomberg Businessweek He sports a necklace with the logo of a favorite token. Photographer: Levi Mandel for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nRich Etienne, an engineer in Florida who lost about $100,000 in the Celsius collapse, said in a phone interview that he has a good feeling about the market now. He says it\u2019s a matter of watching for patterns in the charts\u2014\u201clittle movements, fake-outs, certain people shilling.\u201d It\u2019s less science than art, he says: \u201cYou start to get the vibe that this is it.\u201d\n\nA Dutch institutional investor-turned-Bitcoin analyst who goes by the handle \u201cPlan B\u201d is best known for his charts predicting that Bitcoin would pass $100,000 in 2021. When that didn\u2019t happen, his reputation took a hit. \u201cYou see a lot of hate,\u201d Plan B told me over Zoom. (Like many crypto influencers, he prefers to be identified by his handle out of concern for his safety.) He stands by his optimistic analysis, particularly his popular \u201cstock-to-flow\u201d model that predicts Bitcoin will continue trending upward as the issuance of new coins slows, as it was programmed to do by its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. (The model assumes Bitcoin\u2019s price is driven by scarcity, a logic familiar to gold bugs as well as Beanie Babies collectors.) Plan B now estimates that by 2028, Bitcoin will be worth $100,000 to $1 million, up from about $27,000 today. The date, in other words, moved back a few years. \u201cFor me it\u2019s the long game,\u201d he says. He adds that his bet on Bitcoin is all-or-nothing: \u201cIt\u2019s either going to zero or it\u2019s going to be the successor to the US dollar.\u201d\n\nAcademics say this type of thinking\u2014doubling down on one\u2019s conviction, despite a crash\u2014is consistent with the psychology of both trading and gambling. Investors are more apt to sell assets that have gained in value than to let go of ones that have dropped; it\u2019s a phenomenon known as the disposition effect. There are different explanations for this, says Tobin Hanspal, assistant professor of finance at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. One is that traders with plunging assets become risk-loving because they feel they have nothing to lose. Another says they\u2019re avoiding feelings of regret. People \u201cdo not want to admit defeat or face the realization that they made a mistake,\u201d Hanspal says. (This is me.)\n\nBlec blames the collapse on \u201ctoo much trust.\u201d Photographer: Tamara Reynolds for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nOthers keeping the faith describe the crash as a purge that proves crypto must return to its roots. The whole point of Bitcoin, according to Satoshi\u2019s white paper, was to allow people to transact money directly with \u201cno central authority\u201d like a government or bank, or a company such as FTX or Celsius. This idea of decentralization has a totemic power for some, with a resonance that seems as much emotional as intellectual.\n\nChris Blec, who writes an online newsletter called the Blec Report, has made a career out of criticizing any crypto project that deviates from the original purpose of blockchain technology. Companies such as FTX were \u201cabusing Satoshi\u2019s invention,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re using it in ways it\u2019s not intended to be used.\u201d Blec argues that most of the projects that collapsed over the past year suffered from the same problem: \u201ctoo much trust.\u201d Any system that requires trusting human beings is inherently unstable, he says, and can create a bubble. \u201cEvery time it bursts,\u201d he says, \u201cmore people understand that.\u201d\n\nThose Who Knew\n\nFrances Coppola wasn\u2019t always a crypto hater. \u201cWhen Bitcoin first came out, I was quite keen on it,\u201d she says. The UK-based writer on economics and banking had long seen a need for an alternative to the bank-based payment system, and cryptocurrencies seemed like a promising development. But by 2021 she\u2019d turned skeptic. That summer she posted a Twitter thread explaining why even decentralized crypto systems run by code could be prone to catastrophic failure. She argued that they\u2019d suffer digital bank runs if investors started to pull their money out quickly, which their algorithms wouldn\u2019t be able to stop. \u201cThe algos are built on the assumption that humans never panic and stampede for the exit, ignoring the overwhelming evidence that they do,\u201d she wrote.\n\nHer tweets caught the attention of Do Kwon, the creator of TerraUSD, a then-hot coin that used a decentralized algorithm to maintain a steady value of $1. TerraUSD was a popular substitute for US dollars among DeFi traders, and it could be reinvested to earn high yields. \u201cI don\u2019t debate the poor on Twitter,\u201d Kwon tweeted in Coppola\u2019s thread.\n\nCoppola foresaw the crypto panic. Photographer: Jack Kenyon for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u201cSchadenfreude is the right term\u201d\n\n\u201cThat came back to haunt him,\u201d Coppola says. \u201cI ended up being cited in the court case.\u201d She then bursts into a merry laugh. In May 2022, TerraUSD unraveled in exactly the type of bank run Coppola had described. Kwon is now being sued by investors and has been charged with fraud by US prosecutors; he\u2019s denied wrongdoing. For Coppola, the crash, which TerraUSD\u2019s fall partly triggered, has been bittersweet. She doesn\u2019t want to take pleasure in it, given how many people have gotten hurt. And yet, \u201cI did feel a bit, \u2018So there,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cSchadenfreude is the right term.\u201d\n\nCoppola belongs to a community of skeptics who have long pushed back against the narratives spread by crypto boosters. During the bull market, many of those boosters swamped the skeptics with derision. \u201cWe did take a lot of abuse from the \u2018Have fun staying poor\u2019 crowd,\u201d she says. Since the crash, the skeptics have taken a victory lap. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say people are opening bottles of Champagne,\u201d says Amy Castor, another prominent crypto critic, who works as a freelance journalist and writes a reader-supported blog. But they\u2019ve seen their ranks grow. \u201cThere were a handful of us before, screaming into the abyss,\u201d she says. \u201cNow there\u2019s a lot more.\u201d\n\nThe Blame-casters\n\nIn crypto, 2022 was the year of the \u201cbad actor.\u201d (As in malefactor, not Steven Seagal.) Bad actors were suddenly everywhere, tainting the purity of the otherwise unassailable technology. Instead of pointing to structural problems in crypto\u2014the lack of investor protections, say, or the fundamental question of how to prevent a fully decentralized, largely anonymous currency from being used to fund terrorism\u2014believers blamed individuals (or groups) for \u2026 acting badly.\n\nThe baddest actor of all, of course, is the man now known across the cryptosphere as \u201cScam Bankrupt-Fraud.\u201d Molly White, a vocal crypto critic who runs the site Web3 Is Going Just Great, has argued that Bankman-Fried is a useful scapegoat for crypto fans. \u201cIt\u2019s very convenient for them to say, \u2018This isn\u2019t our problem, this is just one guy,\u2019 \u201d she said in a recent podcast interview. (Bankman-Fried, who\u2019s facing criminal fraud charges, has denied wrongdoing.)\n\nOther scapegoats abound. On Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson Tonight, guest host Tulsi Gabbard highlighted an unfounded theory that American politicians were channeling US taxpayer dollars to Ukraine, which was then investing in FTX, which was then funneling money back to Democrats. (Bankman-Fried was a major Democratic donor; his colleague Ryan Salame gave millions to Republicans.) Ukraine\u2019s deputy minister of digital information tweeted that Ukraine \u201cnever invested any funds into FTX.\u201d\n\nThe Communitarians\n\nPerhaps the only byword in the crypto lexicon as powerful as decentralization has been community. Across Twitter and Telegram and Discord, owners of the same asset gather to discuss the greatness of their asset, share memes about it and trash competing assets. This was particularly true of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, those bits of digital art that in some cases traded for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now, previously bustling Discord chatrooms lie quiet, and a few remaining fans wait for updates. \u201cDevs, do something\u201d is the pitiable refrain, the digital equivalent of poking a dead animal with a stick.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very funny to look back and think, \u2018Were we all just drunk or something?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe dissolution of these communities has left scars\u2014some of them literal. In February 2022, Emma Crudgington was scrolling Twitter at her office in Brisbane, Australia, when she spotted a hot new NFT. It was called Tasty Bones, and the logo featured a cartoonish skull with an ice cream cone upended on it. The art was \u201ccute,\u201d she thought, and, more important, the project was getting lots of hype. Demand for access to the presale exceeded supply, and she needed a way to distinguish herself. \u201cI was like, \u2018What\u2019s the most extreme thing I can do?\u2019 \u201d she says. She got the logo tattooed on her arm. She posted a photo of it on the Tasty Bones community Discord chat, and the creators put her on the list to receive two NFTs. She ended up selling them a week later, netting around $12,000.\n\nCrudgington may lose her Tasty Bones tattoo. Photographer: Tammy Law for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNow that the project has disintegrated\u2014a Tasty Bones currently sells for about $50\u2014Crudgington is amused by the tattoo. \u201cIt\u2019s a great story to tell people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very funny to look back and think, \u2018Were we all just drunk or something?\u2019 \u201d She expects she\u2019ll have it removed or covered up. Crudgington is still involved in an NFT project called Sappy Seals. She spends hours every week talking to a subgroup of Seals owners called Sappy Sisters. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a personal therapist,\u201d she says. \u201cWe talk about the most random things, from physics to lip gloss.\u201d Crudgington says the Sisters have transcended their origins. They\u2019ve raised money for a dog charity, rallied support for a community member with cancer and discussed sexual harassment in the NFT space. She can be vague describing the nature of their bond (\u201cthe theme of the community is community\u201d) but says the connection is authentic.\n\nConnection in crypto can be dicey. White has coined the term \u201cpredatory community\u201d for the way it can foster bonds at the expense of its users, much like a multilevel marketing scheme. When emotions get tied up with money and a sense of belonging, it can be hard to see oneself and one\u2019s peers clearly, especially in communities that tout virtuous causes. Such environments are ripe for manipulation. Countless projects have gotten \u201crugged,\u201d or sold off by the creators, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Those that simply fizzle produce the same result.\n\nCrudgington says she recognizes such communities can be exploitative, but the Sappy Sisters are different. \u201cThere\u2019s no monetization,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no ulterior motive behind it.\u201d\n\nThe Ones Who Step Away\n\nIn 2021, after working half a decade in traditional finance\u2014TradFi is the dismissive crypto term\u2014Jill took a job at a firm specializing in DeFi. (She requested I not use her full name so she can speak candidly about her work.) She was drawn to the idea of transaction without go-betweens, particularly in a world where governments can prohibit bank accounts from being used for, say, sex work or birth control. \u201cFor a while, I drank that Kool-Aid,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I realized no one had any idea about OFAC rules.\u201d (The Office of Foreign Assets Control enforces sanctions against terrorist organizations.) The more she learned about the technical aspects of crypto, the less it seemed about financial freedom than \u201cgetting around capital controls.\u201d She says she was also put off by its consumerist culture of boats and models: \u201cI did not fit in.\u201d She recently left that job and is looking for work in TradFi.\n\nThe idea of boats and models didn\u2019t seem to bother another former crypto worker I spoke to, who asked not to be named at all. (People in this group are skittish about talking.) After making six figures in the 2021 bull run, he dropped out of college and took a job at a crypto venture capital firm. His thinking was simple, he says: School sucked, and he wanted to be free, make a ton of money and have a Lambo. The business model in the space was to find a project, promote it, wait for its tokens to rise and take profits. This didn\u2019t seem sinister because everyone was making money. When he did think about the morality of his work, it wasn\u2019t hard to justify; if anyone was getting rugged, it was rich people. In retrospect, he says it was callous not to think about what was going on under the hood.\n\nAfter the market began to slip, what had felt to him like a positive-sum game suddenly seemed zero-sum. He realized that if anyone was making outsize returns, that wasn\u2019t happening for free. A lot of projects his firm had invested in had failed, and he found it hard to get excited about the new ones. I asked if his colleagues believed the projects had real value. They do, he says, and he thinks that\u2019s delusional. Last fall he went back to school.\n\nIn early March, I told David, my normally laconic barber, that I was writing about crypto winter. He perked up and, taking long pauses between snips of hair while gesturing with his scissors, delivered an analysis of what he assured me is the next big thing: artificial intelligence tokens.\n\nIndeed, after the debut of ChatGPT in November, crypto tokens with some link to AI technology (the connection isn\u2019t always clear) have rocketed in value. Multiple people I spoke with mentioned AI integration as a possible path forward for crypto. Perhaps chatbots will be able to spend cryptocurrency to accomplish their tasks. Maybe blockchain technology can help verify authenticity in a world saturated with deepfakes. The influential Twitter account @punk6529 recently posted, \u201cAI will unveil what crypto\u2019s true purpose is.\u201d The tone of these conversations\u2014hushed, commiserating, vaguely oracular, comically speculative\u2014felt familiar. I told David I\u2019d look into it. I have not.\n\nBeam is a freelance journalist. He made his first crypto purchase in April 2021; he hasn\u2019t made a trade since April 2022."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) continues to flirt with valuations not seen in nearly two months, as price momentum nosedives.\n\nThe asset, which is down 2.5% on the day to $26,300, lost its footing above a support threshold along $27,000 sending it to its lowest point since March 14.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s return to $25,000 looks like a very \u201creal prospect\u201d in the coming days, FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich told Blockworks in an email.\n\n\u201cThe bears will have their work cut out for them here, as some oversold conditions will have built up by then,\u201d he said, highlighting the distorted equilibrium between buyers and sellers.\n\nFor a time, volatility was muted as prices remained relatively locked between $27,000 and $30,000. That was expected to persist throughout May, as declining interest across crypto derivatives effectively sapped long and short sellers.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that as of May 8, bitcoin volatility was hovering at its lowest point since the beginning of January at 29% \u2014 down significantly from March 13\u2019s peak of 63%, data from IntoTheBlock shows.\n\nHowever, volatility has been spiking on the daily time frame since May 8 and that uptick is poised to feed into medium-term price action.\n\nStill, the fact that the price has not yet breached $25,000 is significant when viewing this year\u2019s performance, Kuptsikevich added.\n\n\u201cNow it has every chance of becoming an equally reliable support,\u201d he said.\n\nBut first, bitcoin would need to sort out its congestion issues, Rich Rosenblum CEO of market maker GSR told Blockworks.\n\nData reveals a significant increase in unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions, which currently stand at 284,369. This is a 440% rise compared to the figure of 52,600 observed nearly two months ago on March 17.\n\nThe current weight of the mempool, which refers to the total data size within it, is about 871 MB. This exceeds the default maximum mempool limit of 300MB set by Bitcoin Core, data shows.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that not every node operator sticks to the default 300MB limit. Some opt for higher thresholds to prevent discarding transactions with lower fees.\n\nWhen this occurs, transactions continue to be processed, they just might come with a higher cost, likely the result of a newly popular use case for the world\u2019s oldest crypto.\n\nOver the past week, there has been a substantial increase in the number of Ordinals inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, which has almost doubled from 2.5 million to 4.78 million. This surge is largely attributed to the growing interest in the BRC-20 token.\n\n\u201cOrganic congestion due to excitement over BRC-20? Well, that\u2019s probably bullish that we\u2019re finally seeing enough adoption that it\u2019s slowing the network,\u201d Rosenblum said.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the network is deliberately flooded with a continuous cycle of small transactions in an attempt to profit from a bitcoin short position. \u201cThat\u2019s bearish and hard to police in a decentralized world,\u201d he added.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell 9.42% from May 5 to May 12 to trade at US$26,365 as of 7:30 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading under US$30,000 since April 19. Ether fell 7.3% over the week to US$1,765, losing the key US$1,800 support level.\n\nimage 3\n\nThe U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) released this week showed slower headline inflation in April, boosting hopes for the Federal Reserve to pause rate hikes next month. U.S. annual inflation slowed to 4.9% last month, from 5% in March, but gained 0.4% on the month.\n\nBitcoin briefly topped US$28,300 following the release of U.S. inflation data, but has since been trading lower.\n\n\u201cBitcoin dropped to US$26,900 after rejecting from the ~US$28,200 area. The reaction from the ~US$26,900 area was quite strong,\u201d tweeted pseudonymous crypto analyst Rekt Capital. \u201cThe US$28,200 resistance is the resistance to beat if the price is to enjoy bullish momentum,\u201d he added.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.1 trillion on Friday at 07:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 8.33% from US$1.2 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$510 billion market cap accounted for 46.3% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$214 billion accounted for 19.4%.\n\nBitcoin stuck in traffic\n\nIn another milestone for the world\u2019s first blockchain, the number of non-zero balance Bitcoin addresses reached an all-time high of 46.6 million on Thursday, boosted by the surging interest in Ordinals, a protocol that allows data to be inscribed in the smallest monetary unit of Bitcoin, according to on-chain data analytics firm Glassnode.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin congestion issues worsened. The network faced a growing backlog of transactions exacerbated by the network surpassing 5 million Ordinals inscriptions, fueled by the arrival of memecoins in the form of BRC-20 tokens, a fungible token standard built on Ordinals protocol. BRC-20 tokens surpassed US$1 billion in market capitalization on Tuesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdding to the negative market sentiment, Binance temporarily halted Bitcoin withdrawals twice in 12 hours on Monday, due to a \u201clarge volume of pending transactions.\u201d The world\u2019s largest crypto exchange resumed Bitcoin withdrawals on the same day, while Bitcoin fell as low as US$27,419 on Monday.\n\n\u201c[The correction] was highly due to that since Binance witnessed historically-high BTC outflows,\u201d said Leena ElDeeb, a research associate at 21.co, the parent company of 21Shares, an issuer of crypto exchange-traded products.\n\nBitcoin supply on exchanges fell to a five-year low of 5.84% on Tuesday, according to crypto analytics firm Santiment, indicating that long-term holders are increasingly opting for self-custody solutions.\n\n\u201cThe downtrend was also influenced by misinformation on Twitter, calling the congestion a denial of service attack when, in fact, it was increased demand that led to that congestion and skyrocketing transactions only meant that people were willing to pay more money for faster settlements,\u201d ElDeeb added.\n\nNilesh Verma, crypto market analyst and founder of Crypto Granth consultancy in India, pointed to a separate thread of inaccurate information dissemination surrounding the U.S. government and its Bitcoin holdings as a significant factor in the declining value of Bitcoin this week.\n\nMisinformation emerged on Wednesday, stating that the U.S. government started selling its Bitcoin holdings. According to a March 31 court filing, the U.S. government seized 51,351.89 Bitcoin (worth US$1.4 billion) from Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the darknet marketplace Silk Road. The government sold 9,861 Bitcoin (US$279 million) on March 14 and is planning to sell the remaining 41,490 Bitcoin (US$1.1 billion) in four batches this year.\n\n\u201cSomeone shared fake news that the U.S. government will sell Bitcoin by showing the wrong labeling on the Arkham Platform\u2026 same we saw on April 27, when Bitcoin dropped from US$29,000 to US$27,000 on a glitch in the Arkhram platform,\u201d Verma said.\n\nMarket analysis\n\nCrypto Granth\u2019s Verma said that Bitcoin has strong support around US$26,111. \u201cBitcoin has to hold this support for continued bullish momentum. As of now, we can see a retest of this area. We believe that we will see strong buying near US$25,000-26,000. Weekly closing below US$26,000 will make Bitcoin bearish,\u201d wrote Verma.\n\nBut Dr. Jeff Ross, founder and chief executive officer of investment firm Vailshire Capital Management, said Bitcoin needs to dip lower before starting a new rally.\n\n\u201cShort-term momentum indicators need one more flush lower, ideally to US$24,000, to complete the healthy reset and begin the next leg higher, starting in mid-to-late May,\u201d wrote Ross on his verified Twitter account.\n\nBiggest gainers:\n\nKava, the governance token of a layer-1 blockchain of the same name, was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. Kava rose 17% to US$0.9204, after the protocol announced that its mainnet launch is one week away.\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV) \u2013 a fork of Bitcoin Cash focused on scalability \u2013 was this week\u2019s second biggest gainer, rising 8.47% to US$35.88. The token saw a surge of interest after congestion on the Bitcoin network caused transaction fees to rise .\n\nSee related article: Central Banks\u2019 actions move Crypto; Standard Chartered eyes $100K Bitcoin\n\nNext week: All eyes on the U.S. debt ceiling\n\nNegotiations over raising the U.S. debt ceiling of US$31.4 trillion to keep the government solvent continued on Wednesday, with congressional Republicans demanding more budget cuts. President Biden\u2019s meeting with top Congress leaders planned for Friday was postponed to next week, three sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.\n\nInvestors are also anticipating Europe\u2019s Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices report, scheduled for next Wednesday. Euro area annual inflation for April is expected to come in at 7% for April, up from 6.9% in March, according to flash estimates from Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistical office.\n\nIn the crypto space, liquid Ether staking protocol Lido Finance is preparing for its V2 upgrade, enabling Ether and staked Ether (stETH) withdrawals directly on the protocol. The Lido DAO is set to vote for the V2 upgrade starting today, from 10 p.m. Hong Kong time. With the community\u2019s approval, the upgrade is expected to go live next Monday.\n\nWeb 3.0 gaming protocol Gala Games is also preparing for a contract upgrade on Monday. The protocol will issue its new Gala V2 token in a 1:1 ratio for all Gala token holders, while support and utility for the initial token will cease simultaneously. While most major exchanges signaled their support for the new token, Coinbase stated that it will not be supporting Gala V2.\n\nSee related article: Crypto and NFT Market Update \u2013 May 11th"

        "content": "In this issue\n\nBitcoin network: Stress test Binance: Applying brakes China: Crypto in court\n\nFrom the editor\u2019s desk Dear Reader, It seems the crypto conversation is migrating and fast. This week, I\u2019m writing from the Middle East on the tails of the Dubai FinTech Summit and AIM (Annual Investment Meeting) in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. I\u2019ve been speaking with local firms and investors, along with regulators and regional leaders. And it\u2019s hard to gloss over the disconnect between the shining ideals that are supposed to underpin the U.S. economic model and the dysfunctional reality that the crypto industry is grappling with. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular, is throwing its weight around and failing to support the emergence of an innovative industry. So it\u2019s no surprise to see some significant industry leaders from America \u2014 such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong \u2014 making appearances in the Middle East this week. Coinbase, the exchange giant that recently sued the SEC for more clarity on crypto regulation \u2014 a call that has echoed throughout the entire digital asset industry for longer than anyone cares to remember \u2014 may find that clarity abroad, as U.A.E. looks to entrench its position in the Web3 digital ecosystem. Earlier this year, Abu Dhabi launched a US$2 billion fund to support U.A.E.\u2019s Digital Economy Strategy as part of its diversification efforts into non-oil sectors. That strategy is also in play in Asia as Hong Kong opens up its policy arms with a new regulatory framework for virtual asset service providers to pave the way for crypto trading for the retail market. Hong Kong, too, is looking at comprehensive ways to win back the exodus of talent and innovation that left a few years before as regulators clamped down. And these regions with shared strategies and interests are exploring ways to collaborate. A delegation of industry leaders from Hong Kong and across APAC came to learn how to build meaningful business bridges into the MENA region. Even China is providing more clarity on cryptocurrencies (albeit cautiously). China\u2019s Supreme Court, it has been revealed, ruled back in January that cryptocurrencies possess certain attributes of virtual property. Meanwhile in the U.S., the SEC and the CFTC remain completely at loggerheads over whether cryptos are securities or commodities, an impasse in which no end is in sight, with far-reaching implications for the industry. Crypto policy intransigence from America\u2019s \u201cshining city on a hill\u201d has us wondering if there will soon be geographical moves as the industry finds guiding light elsewhere. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast\n\n1. Bitcoin network: Stress test\n\nThe Bitcoin network has typically attracted fewer memecoins than Ethereum, but its role in the segment has grown since the BRC-20 standards were launched. Image: Canva\n\nTwo months after the launch of BRC-20 standards, the Bitcoin blockchain has become a popular destination for memecoins, a cryptocurrency market niche previously dominated by Ethereum. The market capitalization of Bitcoin-based memecoins has surged from around US$130 million at the beginning of May to over US$588 million at press time, triggering congestion on the world\u2019s oldest blockchain network.\n\nBRC-20 is an experimental token standard based on the Bitcoin blockchain, introduced on March 9 this year by pseudonymous blockchain enthusiast \u201cDomo.\u201d Inspired by the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s ERC-20 standards, BRC-20 allows users to issue fungible tokens through Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals protocol. On the same day, Domo launched the first BRC-20 token, Ordi.\n\nMore than 14,300 BRC-20 tokens have been issued on the Bitcoin blockchain since the standard was launched, according to blockchain data tracker BRC-20.io. Memecoins including ORDI, PEPE Ordinals (not to be confused with the Ethereum-based PEPE memecoin), and MEME have taken the lead in terms of market capitalization, with ORDI\u2019s market cap currently topping US$300 million, almost-two thirds that of all BRC-20 tokens combined.\n\nMemecoins are cryptocurrencies, such as Dogecoin and the Shiba Inu token, that started as a joke or meme. Memecoins typically have no underlying utility, but some have attained market caps in the billions of dollars. Memecoin prices are usually extremely volatile, and their popularity and values are driven mainly by fads and a herd mentality.\n\nThe prices of BRC-20 tokens have been on a roller coaster in the past several days, with their total market cap exceeding US$1 billion on Monday, plunging more than 28% to around US$689 million on Tuesday, and sliding some more to under US$580 million on Thursday evening in Hong Kong, according to BRC-20.io.\n\nThe BRC-20 memecoin surge has driven up transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain and put the network\u2019s capabilities to the test. Transaction fees for minting tokens using the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol reached more than 151 BTC on May 9, an almost 40-fold increase from 4.30 BTC on March 9 when the BRC-20 standard was introduced, according to blockchain data analytics platform Dune Analytics.\n\nDriven by surging transactions and fees on the Bitcoin network, crypto exchange Binance suspended Bitcoin withdrawals twice \u2015 once on May 7 and again on May 8 \u2015 triggering a drop in cryptocurrency prices.\n\nTransactions made by Binance users could not get picked up by Bitcoin validators, as the withdrawals fees charged by the exchange were lower than those charged by the miners, according to a Bloomberg report that quoted Stefan von Haenisch, head of sales trading at digital asset brokerage OSL SG in Singapore.\n\nDriven by blockchain users seeking alternatives to high Bitcoin transaction fees, the Litecoin blockchain has logged record-high daily transactions this week. Transactions on Litecoin topped 525,000 on Monday, more than five times higher than the start of the month, according to blockchain data platform BitInfoCharts.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Ordinals protocol was introduced in January and allows data such as text and images to be inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain, a function similar to that used in the minting of non-fungible tokens.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Bitcoin\u2019s embrace of memecoins helped the network achieve record-breaking transaction figures in the past week, but keen-eyed observers of the surge noticed that the dollar value of many transactions shrunk from US$1,000 to US$1. This downshift in value brings Bitcoin\u2019s on-chain behavior into line with other chains able to host tokens. It\u2019s a good sign for Bitcoin, but a terrible one for the environment. Bitcoin is notoriously slow at updating. Of all the nodes on the Bitcoin network that are reachable (some hide behind VPNs to avoid detection) currently only around 36% run the latest version of Bitcoin\u2019s core software. That makes upgrading all nodes difficult and makes changes to Bitcoin\u2019s core software a challenge. Introducing the BRC-20 token standard is a demonstration that change is possible on the network. But one change that hasn\u2019t been considered is Bitcoin\u2019s horrendous energy consumption. Bitcoin, now the only large blockchain running on a proof-of-work protocol, continues to tax energy grids across the world. The surge in transactions has increased the power needed to keep the network running. Although Bitcoin\u2019s electricity consumption has fallen significantly below its usage from a year ago, it represents a problem for the long-term sustainability of the network and the planet. If the trend toward smaller transactions accelerates, expect Bitcoin to become a burden on energy grids once again, perhaps even forcing miners out of their adopted homes in such eco-unfriendly places with artificially low energy prices as Texas.\n\n2. Pause and reset\n\nBinance\u2019s suspensions of Bitcoin withdrawals come amid surging transaction volumes that have strained the network\u2019s capabilities. Image: Canva\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, suspended Bitcoin withdrawals twice within 12 hours on Sunday and Monday Hong Kong time, citing a \u201clarge volume of pending transactions\u201d on the Bitcoin blockchain. The suspension came amid a surge in Bitcoin transaction fees, which has put the world\u2019s oldest blockchain network under pressure.\n\nBinance tweeted on Monday: \u201cOur set fees did not anticipate the recent surge in Bitcoin network gas fees\u201d and the exchange said it was attempting to solve the issue by amending pending transactions with higher fees so they would be picked up by mining pools.\n\n\u201cPending transactions are being processed by replacing them with higher transaction fees,\u201d Binance said after it resumed allowing Bitcoin withdrawals. \u201cTo prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed.\u201d\n\nBinance also noted in the tweet it has been working to integrate the Bitcoin Lightning Network into its transaction services, which it said would help in such situations. The Lightning Network is a layer-2 protocol for the Bitcoin blockchain that aims to improve the network\u2019s scalability.\n\nOn Sunday night Hong Kong time, Binance tweeted that it had encountered a \u201ccongestion issue\u201d and had to halt Bitcoin withdrawals. About an hour and a half later, it said it had resumed withdrawals.\n\nData from CryptoQuant showed that Binance saw total outflows of around 188,281 BTC on Sunday alone, the largest daily volume CryptoQuant has recorded since it started tracking such data in May 2020.\n\nThe average transaction fee on the Bitcoin blockchain reached US$19.20 on Sunday, its highest level in almost two years, and soared to US$31.14 on Monday, according to data from blockchain information platform BitInfoCharts. Bitcoin\u2019s average transaction fee was only US$2.88 at the beginning of May.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? The surge in activity on the Bitcoin network, and the subsequent suspension of BTC withdrawals by Binance, was interpreted by some as an example of how someone might attack the Bitcoin network in the future, choking it with transaction requests. Others, meanwhile, highlighted that to do so would require deep pockets, as one user had to pay more than 5 BTC (over US$170,000) to complete one transaction earlier this week. The congestion temporarily created a fork in the Bitcoin blockchain that meant nearly 10 BTC had been double-spent as it had been registered on both chains. The last time this happened was November 2020, highlighting how unusual congestion on the network has become. The rocketing fees, alongside record-breaking outflows, suggest Bitcoin may be entering a new phase in its evolution. The total number of Bitcoin-based digital assets is now more than 5 million, a figure that has doubled in less than a week. Although historically Bitcoin has been used as a store of value, and the demand on the network has therefore been manageable, the explosion of people taking advantage of the BRC-20 standard means the network and its off-ramps need to adapt.\n\n3. Small doses\n\nThe decision by China\u2019s top court to allow settlement in crypto of cases involving small sums of debt marks a modest departure from Beijing\u2019s ban on all crypto transactions. Image: Canva\n\nVirtual assets can be used legally in China to settle debts in certain cases involving transactions made as part of barter agreements or labor services, despite the nation\u2019s blanket ban on cryptocurrency transactions, the Supreme People\u2019s Court of China declared at a conference earlier this year.\n\nThe country\u2019s top court said at the conference on financial cases in January that cryptocurrencies shared some attributes of virtual properties, and if parties in cases agreed to use small amounts of cryptocurrencies to settle their debts, those contracts should be regarded as valid by Chinese courts.\n\nIf cryptocurrency transactions could not be executed due to legal restrictions, courts would determine compensation based on the actual value of the agreed sum of crypto involved when contracts were signed.\n\nThe Supreme Court added that courts would not accept any complaints by users if their cryptocurrencies had been traded after Sept. 4, 2017 \u2014 the date that Beijing imposed a ban on initial coin offerings and crypto exchange services \u2014 and in cases in which trading platforms or token issuers failed to fulfill their liquidation obligations.\n\nCourt records further clarified that the use of cryptocurrencies as payment for fiat currencies or physical commodities under the guise of contracts would be treated as illegal.\n\nThe conference records align with the Chinese government\u2019s stance on cryptocurrencies, which emphasizes that tokens such as Bitcoin, Ether and Tether do not have the same legal status as fiat money. China issued its comprehensive ban on cryptocurrency transactions in September 2021.\n\nOutside mainland China, Hong Kong\u2019s push to develop itself as a crypto hub has received Beijing\u2019s blessing, with Chinese state-owned banks now offering services to crypto firms in the territory."

        "title": "Today's markets: Bitcoin is 150% up, gold flirts with new record - Euronews",
        "content": "Investors are eyeing good news from the US economy while concerns of a broader Israel-Hamas war temporarily pushed the price of gold to new levels.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBitcoin has reached $42,245 as it rides a wave of momentum on expectations about US interest rate cuts and as traders anticipate the imminent approval of US stock market-traded bitcoin funds.\n\nThe world's biggest cryptocurrency jumped more than 8% above $42,000 on Monday, its highest since April 2022.\n\nBitcoin is up by over 150% so far this year - with its price standing at $17,140 a year ago - though the current price is still more than 40% lower than its all-time high in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, gold has been shining once again, as safe haven investments do in periods of geopolitical volatility.\n\nAn attack on an American warship and commercial vessels in the Red Sea on Sunday kept investors on their toes and inflamed fears that the Israel-Hamas war could widen into a broader conflict.\n\nThe precious metal reached a new record, amidst expectations that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates next year, as well as tension in the Middle East and a weaker dollar. The price shortly visited $2,144 an ounce, an all-time high, before easing back around $2,090 in the Monday morning trade.\n\n\"The market is sensitive to any expansion of this conflict,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. \"I think active managers in any event are more likely to lock in their gains if this is a harbinger of a deeper military conflict that involves the US.\"\n\nOil prices are down\n\nDespite some expectations and the rising geopolitical tensions, oil prices went south, pressured by investor scepticism over the latest OPEC+ decision on supply cuts and uncertainty surrounding global fuel demand, though the risk of supply disruptions from the Middle East conflict limited losses.\n\nMonday's fall adds to a 2% decline last week after the supply cuts announced on Thursday by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia, together known as OPEC+.\n\nBrent crude futures were hovering above $78 and WTI crude futures fell below $74 per barrel on Monday morning.\n\nHow did data from Europe set the mood Monday morning?\n\nThe main European stock indexes showed a mixed picture on Monday morning, with only the German DAX and the Spanish IBEX 35 showing slight gains, as a handful of data has been released to set a mood for investors.\n\nThe trade surplus in Germany increased to \u20ac17.8 billion in October 2023, as exports fell by 0.2% compared to the previous month to \u20ac126.4 billion. Imports however fell more spectacularly to \u20ac108.6 billion, down by 1.2% from the previous month and 16.3% from a year earlier, largely due to lower energy prices.\n\nMeanwhile, in Spain, the number of people registering as jobless fell by 24,573, or 0.9%, to 2.73 million in November 2023. Spain's unemployment rate was 11.84% in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAnother positive development from the heart of Europe came in the form of Switzerland's inflation rate slowing to a two-year low. Prices rose 1.4% in November from a year earlier, according to the Federal Statistics Office.\n\nIt's the final reading ahead of the Swiss National Bank's (SNB) next interest rate decision on 14 December. The SNB's current policy interest rate is at 1.75%, while its inflation target range is 0% to 2%.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is also holding its monetary policy meeting on 14 December and investors are closely watching whether recent surprisingly good inflation data was good enough news for the Eurozone lender to relax its tight monetary policy.\n\nHowever, ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos cautioned the markets of high uncertainty at a financial event on Monday, adding that \"it was too early to declare victory,\" writes Reuters.\n\nWhat could drive investors' hands this week?\n\nMarkets are hungrily watching signs of easing inflation and hope the Fed is done raising interest rates.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAsian stocks mainly fell on Monday amidst concerns over China\u2019s economic health. Indian shares were the exception, as they rose fuelled by financial and energy stocks, while key wins for the ruling party in state elections lifted the domestic market.\n\nUS stocks closed at their highest level since March 2022 on Friday after comments from Fed chair Jay Powell fuelled hopes that the central bank is done raising interest rates and will start cutting rates sooner than expected.\n\nOn the wave of this, last Friday the S&P 500 (index tracking 500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the US) reached a new 2023 high.\n\nThis week, investors are going to closely watch oil inventories in the US and the various jobs reports from the country, as the world's biggest economy is expected to pull a fast recovery and avoid recession next year.\n\nAs new jobs are a leading indicator of economic health, Tuesday's JOLTs job openings, unemployment claims on Thursday, and Friday's unemployment rate are certainly going to drive investors' hands.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe next Fed monetary policy meeting is on 12-13 December.\n\nIn Europe, the Eurozone GDP and employment data due for Thursday could give more details about the bloc's economy, which is feared to be facing recession."

        "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals, a technology that enables adding text, images and code on a satoshi \u2014 the smallest unit of Bitcoin (BTC) \u2014 continues to inspire debate among the Bitcoin community.\n\nSoon after the introduction of Bitcoin Ordinals in January 2023, the technology\u2019s opponents began to raise concerns over its perceived flaws, citing issues like rising transaction costs and slower speeds.\n\nConversely, Ordinals supporters said that the tech provides more opportunities, improves decentralization and ensures freedom of speech.\n\nAs the number of Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions doubled from 2.5 million to over 5 million in just eight days, Cointelegraph looks at the technology and the controversy surrounding it.\n\nCost, speed and security vulnerabilities\n\nThe undeniable and undesired impact of Ordinals on Bitcoin\u2019s network capacity and scalability is one of the biggest arguments by Bitcoin purists, who believe that BTC is supposed to exclusively follow Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s prescribed peer-to-peer payment mission.\n\nThe ongoing rise in BRC-20 activity \u2014 which utilizes Ordinal inscriptions \u2014 has triggered a sharp increase in BTC transaction fees. The trading frenzy of BRC-20 memecoins like Pepe (PEPE) has driven Bitcoin transaction costs to the highest levels since 2021.\n\nAs users continue pouring BTC into minting new tokens settled via Ordinals inscriptions, the blockchain has also experienced massive congestion. On May 7, the Binance exchange temporarily closed BTC withdrawals due to 400,000 pending transactions clogging the mempool.\n\nGiven recent events, can we just agree to rename the mempool to memepool? pic.twitter.com/6jHQKvjPW2 \u2014 alfaleek (yo / uhh / hmm) (@alfaleek) May 3, 2023\n\nEnrico Rubboli, CEO of Bitcoin layer-2 sidechain Mintlayer, told Cointelegraph that the technology behind Ordinals is \u201cheavily flawed\u201d and doesn\u2019t follow the \u201caxioms of the core Bitcoin community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe developers of the standard and the tools are not affiliated with Bitcoin, they are anonymous, and their software has not been thoroughly tested in this application,\u201d Rubboli said. The exec also believes that Ordinals could cause additional regulatory scrutiny for Bitcoin, as new BRC-20 tokens may be considered unregulated securities.\n\nRubboli further argued that, with Ordinals, the protocol is vulnerable to scams. \u201cThe entire ecosystem was set up to be confusing and misleading,\u201d he said, arguing that BRC-20 was created to \u201cleech off the popularity of Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token.\u201d\n\nHe further emphasized that the anonymous BRC-20 creator Domo warned users in the first place that the tokens were \u201cworthless.\u201d Before launching BRC-20, Domo took to Twitter to stress that the token is \u201csimply a fun experiment.\u201d\n\ngm. I'm glad that some people like the experiment. Some additional notes.\n\n1. These will be worthless. Please do not waste money mass minting.\n\n2. Due to how some inscription tools are set up, the 'balance' may be minted to the intermediary address used in https://t.co/mja39YGIow\u2026 \u2014 domo (@domodata) March 9, 2023\n\n\u201cThese will be worthless. Please do not waste money mass minting,\u201d the BRC-20 creator wrote.\n\nArguments from Bitcoin Ordinals supporters\n\nBitcoin Ordinal\u2019s capability to unlock new value on the Bitcoin blockchain is a significant counterargument by supporters of Ordinals. Some Ordinals defenders also believe that issues like higher transaction costs will fade with time.\n\n\u201cOrdinals is a beneficial exploration for Bitcoin application and helps to unlock greater value in the Bitcoin network,\u201d F2Pool chief marketing officer Li Qingfei told Cointelegraph, adding:\n\n\u201cThe network congestion it brings should be temporary, and there will be good solutions to solve the problem and reduce transaction costs, and increase transaction speeds, just like the Lightning Network.\u201d\n\nLi claimed that the increase in transaction fees will encourage more miners to participate in maintaining the network after Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving in 2024. As an active proponent of Ordinals, F2Pool launched a special nonfungible token series called \u201c10\u00b2 Islands\u201d to celebrate its 10th anniversary.\n\nRoundtable21 co-founder Brandon Dallmann echoed Li\u2019s remarks, stating that BRC-20 is currently being stress-tested against Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 protocol. \u201cSince it is not complete yet, the Bitcoin network is unable to keep up with the demand and is getting congested,\u201d he told Cointelegraph.\n\nDallmann also advised users to utilize multiple crypto platforms instead of keeping the entire stake on just one to prevent issues caused by congestion on the Bitcoin network.\n\nSome community members asked why one should hinder Bitcoin\u2019s transformation from \u201cmagic internet money\u201d to a more complex technology.\n\n\u201cI see the backlash from many BTC purists, but I don\u2019t think that anyone should use their platform to attempt to censor transactions and attempt to discern between what is a \u2018valid\u2019 and \u2018invalid\u2019 transaction on any network,\u201d AngelBlock founder Alex Strzesniewski told Cointelegraph.\n\nMany Ordinals supporters have also noted the technology\u2019s contribution to the freedom of speech. \u201cI know everyone hates ordinals, but whether it\u2019s text or images, the ability to publish uncensorable information on the Bitcoin time chain effectively makes speech uncensorable worldwide forever,\u201d Bitcoin observer BitPaine wrote on Twitter.\n\nPerspective matters most\n\nDespite the clashing perspectives between Ordinals\u2019 supporters and detractors, it\u2019s important to note that much of the reasoning for or against them largely depends on perspective.\n\nFor example, for layer-2 tech builders, it is only natural to oppose Bitcoin\u2019s base layer developments like Ordinals. In contrast, miners will likely not oppose something that could increase their revenues.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are hardly changing anything for hodlers, who most likely won\u2019t care much about transaction fees or the size of the mempool. However, they are causing many issues for traders and other market participants like crypto exchanges.\n\nWhether or not Ordinals are here to stay, the community has yet to see the technology\u2019s full potential and its true consequences."

Its eccentric leader has gone on Bitcoin-buying sprees and businesses now have to accept the cryptocurrency by law.\n\nPresident Bukele has turned things around in the country by launching a historic crackdown on El Salvador\u2019s notorious criminal groups. He in turn hopes to transform the country into a tech hub.\n\nAnd Salvadorans seem pleased with the turnaround: Murders are down and Bukele regularly polls well.\n\nBut human rights groups have criticized his crime-tackling strategy and institutions like the World Bank and the IMF have slammed the Bitcoin idea.\n\nReal data is hard to get hold of, too: No one other than the Salvadoran government knows how much murders have really dropped by\u2014or how much Bitcoin the government owns.\n\nStill, the impact of the Bitcoin and surf tourism campaign is undeniable.

        "content": "Bitcoin prices slid on Friday morning in Asia to below US$27,000 amid concerns about shrinking liquidity and congestion on the network that are driving up transaction costs. Ether fell below support at US$1,800 as all top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies retreated. Polygon\u2019s Matic led the losers. U.S. equity futures edged up as economic data on Thursday indicated inflation is slowing, raising optimism the Federal Reserve may halt its interest rate hikes in June.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin network buckles under weight of BRC-20\u2019s runaway success\n\nBitcoin, Ether fall to monthly lows\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nBitcoin slid 2.13% to US$26,974 in the 24 hours to 08:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, losing 6.63% for the week. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fell to US$26,781 at one stage on Thursday, the lowest price since March 28.\n\nCongestion on the Bitcoin blockchain is fueling the slide, with a backlog of waiting transactions reaching almost 300,000 on Friday morning, over six times higher than the number on May 9. That was when the BRC-20 token standard was introduced to allow the minting of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network and generated a surge in activity, according to data from blockchain researcher Jochen Hoenicke.\n\nThe jump in transaction volumes has raised concerns among Bitcoin developers. Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin code contributor, emailed the Bitcoin developer community on Monday to suggest blocking the transactions of BRC-20 tokens, which \u201cthreaten the smooth and normal use of the Bitcoin network as a peer-to-peer digital currency.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s drop also comes amid rising concerns about liquidity. Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto, two of the world\u2019s leading market makers, are reportedly quitting digital asset trading in the U.S., according to a Bloomberg report on Wednesday.\n\nEther fell 2.34% to US$1,795, posting a weekly loss of 4.45%. The token dropped to US$1,774 on early Friday, the lowest price since April 3.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Beacon Chain of the Ethereum Network briefly stopped validating transactions on early Friday morning, with Ethereum developers tweeting later that the outage had been resolved and the cause still under investigation.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower. Polygon\u2019s Matic token led the losers, dropping 3.75% to US$0.8406 and retreating 14.45% for the week. The token logged a low of US$0.8332 earlier today, the lowest price since January 8, 2023.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 2.11% in the past 24 hours to US$1.12 trillion.

They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.42% to 3,394.50 in the 24 hours to 10:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 7.14% for the week.\n\nNFT sales on the Ethereum blockchain fell 47.62% in the past 24 hours to US$17.65 million, as the hype for Millady Maker NFT collection faded. Sales of Millady Maker dropped 86.53% to US$1.01 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nNFT trading is slowing due to the recent memecoin hype, with very few new users entering the space, according to Eric Dettman, NFT advisor at CryptoSlam. NFT buyers on the Ethereum blockchain totaled 45,298 in the past seven days, a drop of 72.97%.\n\nMemecoins are also losing steam. The price of Ordi, the memecoin that accounts for more than 60% of the total market cap of BRC-20 tokens, has slid 31.43% in the past 24 hours, according to blockchain data tracker BRC-20.io.\n\nEquity futures gain on slowing inflation data\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures rose as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged up 0.07%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.14%. And the Nasdaq Composite futures added 0.25%. The three U.S. indexes closed mixed in regular trading on Thursday on investor concerns about banking risks.\n\nThe U.S. producer price index (PPI) in April logged an annual increase of 2.3%, lower than predictions of 2.4% and the slowest pace since January 2021, according to Reuters on Thursday.\n\nU.S. initial jobless claims rose to 264,000 in the week ending May 6, beating expectations and reaching the highest level since October 2021, according to a Thursday Bloomberg report. Together with the PPI, the data points to a slowdown in the U.S. economy, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged in June.\n\nOn U.S. banks, PacWest Bancorp shares fell more than 20% on Thursday, after the California-based lender said its deposits declined approximately 9.5% in the week ending May 5, sparking new concerns about the banking industry after a series of failures at lenders this year.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and top lawmakers postponed Friday talks on raising the U.S. debt ceiling to early next week, according to CNN on Thursday, with the negotiations making little progress so far.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will decide on June 14 its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 87.1% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June, and a 12.9% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, up from 3.9% on Thursday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)\n\nSee related article: Japan looks to regain its place in the cryptocurrency world pecking order"

        "title": "Bitcoin congestion issues continue amid BRC-20 memecoin, Ordinals surge - Forkast News",
        "content": "The Bitcoin blockchain has been facing a growing backlog of transactions in recent days amid the arrival of memecoins on the network.\n\nThe market capitalization of BRC-20 tokens, a fungible tokens standard built on the Ordinals protocol that is fueling the memecoin surge on Bitcoin, surpassed US$1 billion on Tuesday, before retreating to US$588 million as of 6:00 p.m. in Hong Kong Thursday, according to data provider BRC-20.io.\n\nHeadlined by memecoin rising star Pepe, over 14,300 types of BRC-20 tokens are contributing to jamming up the blockchain thanks to Ordinals, a protocol that allows data to be inscribed in the smallest monetary unit of Bitcoin, satoshi. The inscription also brought a version of non-fungible tokens (NFT) to Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe primary driver of this congestion and the related surge in transaction fees are inscriptions that use the BRC-20 minting standard,\u201d said Colin Harper, head of research and content at Bitcoin mining software and services firm Luxor Technologies, in an email.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s network congestion can be measured by its memory pool size, or mempool, the queue of pending valid transactions waiting to be added to blocks. It is often measured in virtual bytes (vbytes), and a single Bitcoin block can theoretically hold up to a million vbytes.\n\nOver 298,312 transactions were waiting to be validated as of 6 p.m. on Thursday, which is equal to a near one-month high of 186.7 million vbytes. Bitcoin\u2019s mempool size stood at 3.31 million vbytes on April 24, according to on-chain data from mempool.space.\n\nThe expanding mempool size caused Bitcoin transaction fees to rise to US$30.91 on Monday, the highest in two years. This dropped to US$14.05 as of 6 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to Chicago-based investment software company ycharts.\n\n\u201c[BRC-20 inscriptions] use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file format which is relatively data heavy. Combine that heaviness with the \u2018first-come, first-mint\u2019 incentives that BRC-20 mints create and you have a recipe for transaction congestion,\u201d wrote Harper,\n\nMiners profit from Bitcoin congestion\n\nWith the heating memecoin economy on the Bitcoin blockchain, the network surpassed 5 million Ordinals inscriptions on Tuesday, according to data from Dune Analytics.\n\nThe congestion may have lengthened waiting times for Bitcoin users, but Luxor Technologies\u2019 Harper said that the BRC-20 standard essentially doubled miner revenue.\n\n\u201cSurging fees will price out some transactions for sure, but I doubt that this BRC-20 minting mania will last too much longer. Fees may become elevated like this from time to time with different inscription mints or other demands for block space, but they will revert to the mean eventually,\u201d wrote Harper.\n\nNazar Khan, the chief operating officer and chief technology officer of U.S.-based Bitcoin mining company TeraWulf, also expects transaction fees to return to normal in the short term.\n\n\u201cWhile we expect transaction fees to return to lower levels in the next couple of weeks, we believe this episode highlights how varied the use case for the Bitcoin network can be over time. Whatever the short-term impacts of surging transaction fees may be today, Bitcoin is the most secure and robust network that exists and will continue to attract increasing levels of activity,\u201d added Khan.\n\nEnough memes for Bitcoin?\n\nWhile miners welcomed the revenue surge, some Bitcoin developers are campaigning to phase out Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens from the network.\n\n\u201cAction should have been taken months ago. Spam filtration has been a standard part of Bitcoin Core since day 1. It\u2019s a mistake that the existing filters weren\u2019t extended to Taproot transactions. We can address that, or try a more narrow approach like OP_RETURN (ie, what \u201cOrdisrespector\u201d does). Since this is a bugfix, it doesn\u2019t really even need to wait for a major release,\u201d said Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr in an email dated May 8.\n\nNFT supporters, including Washington Sanchez, the NFT product lead at U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, brushed off Dashjr\u2019s threat on social media.\n\n\u201cLuke is waging a 1 man jihad against Ordinals, I doubt the other devs will take him seriously based on their precious comments that Bitcoin was working as expected if people are submitting valid transactions,\u201d tweeted Sanchez.\n\nHowever, online discussions show that Dashjr has some support from the Bitcoin community.\n\n\u201c[Bitcoin] was not originally intended to support tokens or smart contracts,\u201d one user wrote on bitcointalk.org, an online cryptocurrency forum launched by pseudonymous Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto. \u201cThese changes are breaking the network and eroding the years of trust that Bitcoin has created.\u201d\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin\u2019s mempool congestion eases after millionth Ordinals inscription"

        "content": "Macro Markets, hosted by crypto analyst Marcel Pechman, airs every Friday on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel and explains complex concepts in layperson\u2019s terms, focusing on the cause and effect of traditional financial events on day-to-day crypto activity.\n\nToday\u2019s show starts by discussing the economic crisis in Argentina, a Latin American country that is experiencing hyperinflation. After years of populist measures, its local currency, the peso, saw its value go down by 70% in two years. The government\u2019s overspending caused another issue: a lack of United States dollars for the government and companies to pay for imports and remittances. But what does that mean for the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin (BTC) and gold?\n\nAccording to Pechman, gold poses serious problems, as there is no easy way to ensure whether or not the precious metal is fake, and it doesn\u2019t actually work for remittances. Therefore, dollars and euros are the preferred means of savings and exchange for those facing a weak domestic currency.\n\nPechman proceeds to explain how fintechs\u2019 costs and government control limit their potential in Argentina, and why stablecoins are the preferred vehicle for remittances. On the other hand, the analyst shows why cryptocurrencies fail to attract people in those fragile economies, including El Salvador.\n\nThe next segment of Macro Markets focuses on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Reuters reported that the 113 biggest banks in the U.S. will have to cover the recent FDIC loss of $16 billion caused by saving failed financial institutions. Consequently, there\u2019s a cascading effect as the remaining institutions are obligated to cover the losses. Pechman mentions how the Federal Reserve will eventually reduce interest rates and benefit risk-on assets, including Bitcoin.\n\nIf you are looking for exclusive and valuable content provided by leading crypto analysts and experts, make sure to subscribe to the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price (BTC) broke below its 55-day support at $27,000 on May 12. As a result, the two-day, 7% correction to $26,155 caused $100 million worth of long BTC futures contracts to be liquidated.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin margin and futures markets displayed strength during the down-move, fueling hope of a recovery toward $28,000.\n\nRegulatory pressure, stronger U.S. dollar bite\n\nRegulatory uncertainty in the United States significantly increased after Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital received another subpoena. The publicly traded mining company informed investors on May 10 that it received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning whether it may have violated federal securities laws, among other things, by using related-party transactions.\n\nFurthermore, there\u2019s the additional risk of the 627,522 Bitcoin held by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has been trading at a steep discount for over a year as Grayscale\u2019s holding company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), struggles with some failing subsidiaries. DCG\u2019s crypto lending and trading firm, Genesis Capital, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January.\n\nDespite having separate corporate structures, Genesis had \u201cintercompany obligations\u201d with holding company DCG, so the consequences for the administration of the Grayscale funds are unknown. Additionally, the group reportedly owes Gemini\u2019s clients about $900 million, and the U.S. SEC charged Genesis and Gemini in January.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 7.2% correction happened as the U.S. Dollar Strength Index (DXY), which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of foreign exchanges, displayed strength. The indicator reached 101 on May 8, nearing its 12-month low, a sign of low confidence in the government\u2019s ability to curb inflation while simultaneously managing to increase the debt limit.\n\nHistorically, there has been an inverse correlation between the DXY index and risk-on assets such as Bitcoin, given that a weaker dollar tends to drive demand for alternative stores of value and scarce assets.\n\nLet\u2019s look at derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market environment.\n\nBitcoin margin market traders slightly less optimistic\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because they allow investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nOKX, for instance, provides a margin lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. Traders can increase their exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin lending ratio decreased between May 8 and May 11. Still, that is not concerning, given that those traders remain favoring bullish strategies as the stablecoin (long) demand currently surpasses the BTC (short) demand by a factor of 18, which is healthy.\n\nRelated: Texas votes to add crypto to state\u2019s Bill of Rights\n\nNo signs of panic selling after Bitcoin price crash\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets, traders should analyze the long-to-short metric. The metric gathers data from exchange clients\u2019 positions on spot, perpetual, and quarterly futures contracts, thus offering better information on how pro traders are positioned.\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nExchanges\u2019 top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nEven though Bitcoin broke below the $28,000 support, professional traders have increased their leveraged long positions using futures, according to the long-to-short indicator.\n\nAt crypto exchange OKX, the long-to-short ratio increased from 0.92 on May 8 to 1.01 on May 12. Meanwhile, at Binance, the long-to-short ratio stabilized at 1.13, indicating there was no shift to a bearish position from whales and market makers.\n\nTherefore, despite the 12% price decline from a high of $29,865 on May 6, traders using margin and futures contracts did not abandon their bullish stance. The movement indicates confidence that Bitcoin is more likely to reclaim $28,000 than succumb to the next support level near $24,500.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is entering prime \u201cbuy the dip\u201d territory as the clock ticks down to the 2024 block subsidy halving.\n\nThat is the conclusion of several well-known market participants this month, with Bitcoin just one year away from its \u201cvery interesting\u201d next halving.\n\nBitcoin vs. the halving: Time to buy?\n\nBitcoin halving cycles are known to follow patterns when it comes to price activity in a given period.\n\nThese four-year \u201cepochs\u201d have so far contained a macro high and macro low for BTC price, with those events likewise four years apart from one another.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in each cycle, the macro low has tended to occur a little over one year before the next halving. For longtime Bitcoin figures, including crypto media guru Pete Rizzo, there is thus little reason to believe that the future will be substantially different.\n\n\u201cA small reminder the world\u2019s most valuable money is only designed to get more scarce. Plan accordingly,\u201d he wrote in part of a tweet on May 12.\n\nRizzo was celebrating the three-year anniversary of the 2020 halving, and an accompanying chart underscored BTC price behavior relative to how many months remained before a halving event.\n\nBTC/USD monthly chart with time to halvings marked. Source: Pete Rizzo/Twitter\n\nCommenting, investor and entrepreneur Alistair Milne went further, suggesting that for those looking to profit from BTC exposure, the time to buy is now, while the months before the halving are less beneficial entry points.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t short when it\u2019s dark green and be all in before it\u2019s blue\u2026,\u201d he summarized the chart\u2019s contents.\n\nPlanB: 2024 halving \u201cnot priced in\u201d\n\nEarlier in the month, meanwhile, another popular yet controversial Bitcoin industry figure used the same halving narrative to insist that the price cycles were not a matter of chance.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Halving: How it works and why it matters\n\nIn a post of his own, PlanB, the pseudonymous creator of the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) family of Bitcoin price forecasting models, claimed that half of market participants considered the relationship between halvings and price was random.\n\nHis comments came within the context of how halvings relate to S2F, a theory that itself continues to see widespread criticism as a result of missed price targets from 2021 onward.\n\nNevertheless, for PlanB, too, BTC/USD remains low, with the upcoming halving not yet given sufficient market appreciation.\n\n\u201cWhy is bitcoin S2F/halving not priced in? Because ~50% thinks the BTC price jumps after last 3 halvings (red) are a coincidence,\u201d he wrote alongside an illustrative chart.\n\n\u201cHalvings are key to S2F, but these critics focus on auto-correlation between halvings and conclude there is no relation between S2F/halvings and price. I disagree, obviously. 2024 halving will be very interesting!\u201d\n\nBitcoin Stock-to-Flow chart. Source: PlanB/Twitter\n\nIn a subsequent discussion, PlanB called the idea of Bitcoin price increasing as halvings decrease available supply, or \u201cflow,\u201d a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Alameda\u2019s $38B IRS bill, Do Kwon kicked in the assets, Milady frenzy: Asia Express\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Liquidity is becoming a concern after major market makers Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto quit cryptocurrency trading in the U.S. citing unfavorable regulations. Ether led the losers in the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, while Pokadot led the winners. U.S. equity futures traded higher as inflation eased in April, adding to speculation the Federal Reserve may pause its interest rate hikes in June.\n\nSee related article: Hong Kong will have \u2018tight\u2019 crypto regulation, says HKMA chief Eddie Yue\n\nBitcoin, Ether lose ground\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.60% to US$27,554 in the 24 hours to 08:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, logging a weekly loss of 5.24%.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency briefly breached the US$28,000 ceiling on Wednesday as crypto markets rallied on a slower U.S. inflation rate, but soon fell back amid concerns about network congestion and liquidity.\n\nJane Street Group and Jump Crypto, two leading market makers, will quit digital asset trading in the U.S. as regulators crack down on the industry, according to a Bloomberg report citing unnamed sources.\n\n\u201cAfter the collapse of several crypto-friendly banks and FTX it seems like the SEC (regulator) is unsure what leg to stand on and for sure the stance has become more hostile to cryptos and the entire financial and technical ecosystem surrounding it,\u201d Mikkel Morch, chairman and non-executive director at digital asset investment fund ARK36, said in an email.\n\nAs of 08:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, investors liquidated US$41.28 million of Bitcoin positions, almost 75% of which were long positions \u2013 or bets that the price of Bitcoin would rise, according to market data tracker CryptoMeter.io.\n\nEther fell 0.84% to US$1,837, down 3.49% for the week. The token neared US$1,900 on Wednesday before falling back to as low as US$1,795.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Polkadot\u2019s Dot token leading the winners with a gain of 1.91% to US$5.45. However, it\u2019s down 5.43% for the week. Web3 Foundation, the organization behind the Polygon blockchain, testified before the U.S. Congress on Wednesday on digital asset regulations, calling for a clearer rules of the road.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.30% in the past 24 hours to US$1.14 trillion. The total trading volume rose 43.61% to US$45.84 billion.\n\nNFT index dips\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.67% to 3,440.57 in the 24 hours to 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 6.15% for the week.\n\nMilady Maker, an Ethereum-based NFT collection, topped the 24-hour sales across the market after Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Twitter and Tesla, tweeted on Wednesday an image containing the NFT.\n\nMilady Maker\u2019s sales totaled over US$9.54 million in the past 24 hours, a surge of over 3,700%, according to data by CryptoSlam, with its floor price jumping 38.4% to 4.69 ETH (US$8,609), according to CoinGecko.\n\nBoosted by the rise of Milady Maker, NFT sales on the Ethereum blockchain jumped 89.41% in the past 24 hours to US$34.25 million, according to CryptoSlam. The average transaction fees on Ethereum came in at US$19.70 on Wednesday, a drop from its 11-month peak of US$27.68 on Saturday, according to blockchain data platform BitInfoCharts.\n\nEquities futures rise as inflation slows\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures moved higher as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged up 0.04%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.19%. And the Nasdaq Composite futures added 0.16%.\n\nThe three U.S. indexes closed mixed in regular trading on Wednesday as investors digested the U.S. consumer price index report that showed annual inflation unexpectedly slowed to 4.9% in April from 5% in March, the slowest pace in the past two years. The moderate cooling of inflation indicates the Federal Reserve may take a pause in its more than year-long cycle of raising rates to slow inflation.\n\nOn talks to raise the U.S. debt ceiling to keep the government solvent, President Joe Biden warned on Wednesday that a federal government default could trigger a global recession, according to a Bloomberg report. Biden is set to continue talks to raise the debt ceiling on Friday, with congressional Republicans demanding more budget cuts in any agreement.\n\nOn other data releases, the U.S. producer price index and jobless claims come out Thursday to offer further insights into the health of the economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on June 14 to decide its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 96.1% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June, and a 3.9% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, down from 21.2% on Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)\n\nSee related article: Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Moody\u2019s, others to join new financial industry blockchain"

Credit: Twitter/@0xCuteSocks\n\nIn an undisclosed Discord server, the user (known as \u2018camper\u2019) reached out and pleaded with the Bitcoin user to return the cryptocurrency.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cJared from Subway, if you are reading this please help.

I want to live,\u201d wrote the author of the mistake, before providing the details of the transactions.\n\nShockingly though, \u2018Jared\u2019 initially remained silent and seemingly pocketed the funds for himself.\n\nThis is according to Twitter user @0xCuteSocks, who first shared the strange post on social media.\n\nThe user's desperate plea was initially shared on Discord. Credit: Twitter/@0xCuteSocks\n\nAdvert 10\n\nDespite being originally posted on the private server, the request has now gone viral with it being seen over 1.3 million times on Twitter.\n\nThe internet is continuing to react to the unlucky Bitcoin user, with many arguing that this is why they avoid cryptocurrency altogether.\n\nOne shocked tweet read: \u201cIt's incredible how much trust people put in these decentralized systems, but it's also a reminder to always double-check the wallet address before sending large amounts of money!\u201d\n\nHowever, they did have some empathy for the user, writing: \u201cI hope the person who made the mistake is able to get their funds back.\u201d\n\nAdvert 10\n\nAnother user agreed and vented their frustration, writing: \u201cHow do you make multiple accidental transactions to the wrong address?

Source: TradingView\n\nThe BTC/USD pair broke above $29,800 on May 6, but the tide quickly changed as the resistance proved stronger than anticipated.\n\nThe subsequent 8.2% two-day correction tested $27,400 support, favoring the thesis of sideways trading as investors evaluate the economic crisis dynamic and its potential impact on cryptocurrencies.\n\nMeanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway owner and billionaire investor Warren Buffett is no longer optimistic about U.S. economic growth. Such a pessimistic scenario for the global economy might explain why some Bitcoin traders decided to reduce exposure over the past week, greatly reducing the odds of breaking $30,000.\n\nBitcoin options: Bulls were excessively optimistic\n\nThe open interest for the May 12 options expiry is $900 million, but the actual figure will be lower since bears were expecting sub-$28,000 price levels.\n\nThese traders got excessively optimistic after Bitcoin\u2019s price rallied 11.2% between April 9 and April 14, testing the $31,000 resistance.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for May 12. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 1.65 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $560 million in call (buy) open interest and the $340 million in put (sell) options.\n\nBut if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $27,500 at 8:00 am UTC on May 12, only $11 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $28,000 or $29,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nBitcoin bulls aim for $28,000 to balance the scales\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on May 12 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies depending on the expiry price.\n\nThe imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $25,000 and $27,000: 100 calls vs. 9,900 puts. Bears in total control, profiting $230 million.\n\n100 calls vs. 9,900 puts. Bears in total control, profiting $230 million. Between $27,000 and $28,000: 400 calls vs. 5,000 puts.

Between $29,000 and $30,000: 3,300 calls vs. 800 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $70 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor instance, a trader could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nUltimately, after it became clear that the Bitcoin network was working as designed, the selling pressure dissipated, causing Bitcoin\u2019s price to stabilize around $27,500. Nevertheless, traders should be cautious as the bears are still in a better position for Friday\u2019s weekly options expiry, favoring negative price moves.\n\nRelated: PayPal\u2019s crypto holdings increased by 56% in Q1 2023 to nearly $1B\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The Bitcoin (BTC) network is witnessing a paradigm shift as ordinals, an advanced breed of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), rapidly gain traction within the crypto sphere. April 2023 saw the daily ordinals inscriptions record smashed several times, illustrating the escalating curiosity surrounding these digital assets. While ordinals may create new opportunities for the Bitcoin network, skeptics raise concerns about potential negative consequences.\n\nOrdinals, a class of digital assets closely related to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), are inscribed onto satoshis, the smallest denomination of bitcoin. In April, ordinals experienced a surge in popularity, accounting for a significant portion of the network fees.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CryptoNikyous/status/1656248837986746368?s=20\n\nIn May 2023, the cumulative fees paid for ordinals over time have reached an astounding $300 million, with the majority of this expenditure occurring between April and May.\n\nOrdinals fees paid over time (Source: Dune Analytics)\n\nOrdinals gained prominence after the Taproot upgrade, which facilitated improved transaction management, privacy, and reduced transactions costs.\n\nHow do ordinals work?\n\nTo truly understand ordinals, we need to talk about satoshis. Named after bitcoin\u2019s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, a satoshi is the smallest fraction of bitcoin \u2013 one hundred millionth of a bitcoin, to be precise.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about satoshis is that each carries a unique number, determined by the order in which it was mined. This unique number, or \u201cordinal,\u201d is what gives each satoshi its identity.\n\nThink of satoshis as tiny digital canvases, each with a unique identifying number. Now, when you \u201cinscribe\u201d these satoshis with data \u2013 text, images, audio, or more \u2013 they transform into unique digital assets, which can be used in numerous applications, from games to artworks.\n\nInscription is a process of storing information on the blockchain, reflecting ownership of digital objects. When a transaction is confirmed by bitcoin miners and added to the blockchain, it\u2019s as good as etched in stone \u2013 it becomes immutable proof of ownership.\n\nWhen you inscribe data on the Bitcoin blockchain, it gets associated with a particular satoshi, much like marking a personal item with your name. This marked satoshi then allows the transfer and assignment of ownership of that on-chain data or inscription.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, ordinals are like digital stamps, unique and secured on the Bitcoin blockchain. Using an open, permissionless protocol, you can use ordinals to create your own digital assets, owning, selling, and transferring them as you wish.\n\nNFTs vs. Bitcoin ordinals\n\nThe primary distinction between conventional NFTs and Bitcoin ordinals stems from their foundational infrastructure.\n\nYou might also like: Over 225,000 bitcoin transactions are unconfirmed as Ordinals bloat mempool\n\nTraditional NFTs, often built on Ethereum (ETH) or alternative blockchains, operate on separate layers from their base networks and frequently employ smart contracts to enable creation and transfer.\n\nBoth NFTs and ordinals function as distinctive digital assets with provable scarcity. However, what sets ordinals apart is their direct integration with the Bitcoin network, which means they share bitcoin\u2019s security and immutability.\n\nThat said, there\u2019s a flip side to this coin. The integration of ordinals with Bitcoin might lead to network clogging and a spike in transaction costs.\n\nYou might also like: Ordinals and meme coins cripple Bitcoin network, core developer claims\n\nThis has ignited a debate over the long-term feasibility and impact of ordinals.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/avaxbuildr/status/1655129967586320385?s=20\n\nAdvocates argue that ordinals add value by creating new use cases for the network. Conversely, critics contend that ordinals consume precious block space and inflate network fees, contradicting Bitcoin\u2019s fundamental principles.\n\nThere are so many people advocating for an increase of the #Bitcoin block size limit to fit Ordinals inscription data and lower transaction fees.\n\n\n\nThese people probably just haven't been here long enough to know that an increase in block size was already attempted in 2017.

For an in-depth guide, users can consult the Inscriptions handbook provided by the creators of the first ordinal.\n\nAlternatively, a more straightforward method involves minting an ordinal via reputable Bitcoin NFT marketplaces like Gamma, which operate similarly to Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea or Magic Eden.\n\nThe growth of ordinals and its implications\n\nThe ordinals ecosystem has experienced exponential growth since its inception, with over 5 million inscriptions recorded as of May 12, 2023, as per Dune Research data.\n\nOrdinals inscriptions over time (Source: Dune Analytics)\n\nThis surge is primarily attributed to the widespread adoption of the Taproot soft fork, which has reached new all-time highs in adoption and utilization.\n\nIf you're looking to make it:\n\n\n\n* Taproot adoption is at ATH\n\n* Taproot makes it simple to productize #BTC blockspace into any protocol\n\n* People will build on #BTC\n\n* We'll see massive demand for #BTC blockspace\n\n* This blockspace will have to be sold\n\n* BRC-20s like $VMPX will pump https://t.co/DrWumi9TGp pic.twitter.com/cUR2kNOPjo \u2014 Halloween 2008 (@HalloweenIn2008) May 8, 2023\n\nConsequently, average block size and network fees have increased lately, highlighting the potential and challenges posed by the burgeoning popularity of ordinals.\n\nBTC average block size (Source: YCharts)\n\nThe environmental impact of ordinals\n\nCryptocurrencies, particularly those using proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithms like bitcoin, have long been a subject of environmental contention.\n\nOrdinals have rekindled the debate surrounding the Bitcoin network\u2019s energy consumption. With a rise in transactions and demand for block space, ordinals contribute to the network\u2019s overall energy usage.\n\nCritics argue that the environmental impact of ordinals is an unnecessary burden, given that alternative blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, have transitioned to more energy-efficient consensus algorithms like proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nHowever, ordinals\u2019 supporters stress the importance of leveraging the robust security and decentralization provided by the Bitcoin network, which they infer outweighs environmental concerns.\n\nMICHAEL SAYLOR\u203c\ufe0f Ordinals are a catalyst for #Bitcoin adoption. pic.twitter.com/SgHYH23ZOr \u2014 Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) May 10, 2023\n\nLegal and regulatory challenges\n\nLike other digital assets, ordinals may face regulatory scrutiny. Governments worldwide have adopted varied approaches to regulating cryptocurrencies and NFTs, with similar expectations for ordinals.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, ordinals may be considered digital property subject to taxation, while in others, they may face stringent regulations and restrictions, only time will tell.\n\nAs the legal landscape surrounding digital assets evolves, it is crucial for ordinals creators and users to stay informed about changing regulations and ensure compliance with applicable laws.\n\nFuture of ordinals\n\nAs ordinals continue to gain popularity, their use cases and applications are likely to extend beyond digital art and collectibles.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are not a \"fad.\"\n\n\n\nThey cleared the cupcake phase of attention for me. It was the right time to jump in and besides my trust in ZK\u2019s insight, what the brand had to offer was more than just one person.\n\n\n\n\u25b8Brand Alignment\n\n\u25b8Marketing\n\n\u25b8Community \u2014 Minh (@MINHxDYNASTY) May 3, 2023\n\nIndustries such as gaming, real estate, and intellectual property could benefit from the properties of ordinals, opening up new possibilities for the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nOngoing developments in the Bitcoin space, including Lightning Network upgrades and potential protocol enhancements, could alleviate some concerns surrounding network congestion and scalability. This, in turn, could pave the way for broader adoption and acceptance of ordinals in the future.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are ordinals? Ordinals are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) built on the Bitcoin network. They enable the creation, ownership, and transfer of unique digital assets, such as digital art, collectibles, and other forms of digital property. How are ordinals different from traditional NFTs? While the core concept of representing unique digital assets remains the same, ordinals are built on the Bitcoin network, leveraging its security and decentralized nature. Traditional NFTs, on the other hand, are predominantly built on Ethereum or other blockchain networks. What are the use cases for ordinals? Besides digital art and collectibles, ordinals have the potential to be utilized in various industries, including gaming, real estate, intellectual property, and even supply chain management, as a means of verifying authenticity and provenance. How do ordinals impact the Bitcoin network? As demand for ordinals increases, the competition for block space on the Bitcoin network can lead to higher transaction fees and longer confirmation times. However, ongoing developments like the Lightning Network and other protocol improvements may help address these issues in the future. Are ordinals environmentally friendly? The environmental impact of ordinals is a topic of debate, as they contribute to the overall energy consumption of the Bitcoin network, which uses the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm. Critics argue that more energy-efficient alternatives like proof-of-stake (PoS) should be pursued instead. However, proponents emphasize the security and decentralization benefits provided by the Bitcoin network. What is the future of ordinals? The future of ordinals is uncertain, with potential for growth in various industries and the possibility of technological advancements addressing current limitations. As the crypto ecosystem continues to evolve, the true potential of ordinals and their role in the world of digital assets will gradually become clearer.\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Amid the ongoing spike in Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees, some cryptocurrency exchanges have moved to adjust the cost of withdrawing BTC from their platforms.\n\nThe United States-based exchange Kraken has increased Bitcoin withdrawal fees to match the current fees on-chain, the company\u2019s customer support manager wrote on Reddit on May 10.\n\n\u201cThis helps ensure withdrawals are processed on-chain in a timely manner,\u201d the support manager noted.\n\nKraken\u2019s representative also referred to the company\u2019s public list of cryptocurrency withdrawal fees and minimum withdrawal amounts. According to the data, Kraken charges 0.00035 BTC, roughly $10, for a Bitcoin withdrawal, with a minimum amount of 0.0005 BTC, roughly $13.\n\nKraken Support on increasing BTC fees. Source: Reddit\n\nThe minimum BTC withdrawal amount on the Lightning Network (LN) also significantly differs from non-Lightning BTC, starting from as low as 0.00001 BTC, less than $1.\n\nThe support manager also advised customers to consider using the Lightning Network as an alternative. Adopted by Kraken in March 2022, the LN option allows users to withdraw BTC from the platform free of charge.\n\nBitcoin withdrawal fees and minimum withdrawal amounts on Kraken. Source: Kraken\n\nKraken\u2019s public withdrawal fees are significantly less than other major exchanges. Crypto exchange OKX charges between 0.00096 BTC ($26) and 0.00192 BTC ($53) for a BTC withdrawal, a spokesperson for OKX told Cointelegraph. The minimum withdrawal amount is 0.001 BTC, or $27.\n\nOKX declined to comment on whether the exchange will increase withdrawal fees due to skyrocketing Bitcoin transaction costs. The platform also implemented the LN in 2022.\n\nHowever, Kraken isn\u2019t the only exchange that has adjusted BTC withdrawal fees amid the ongoing memecoin trading frenzy.\n\nCrypto exchange KuCoin uses dynamic adjustment for BTC withdrawal fees and minimum withdrawal amounts, a spokesperson for the firm told Cointelegraph on May 10. The adjustment is based on the amount of actual processing fees on the chain so that KuCoin is \u201ccompatible with the market situation,\u201d the representative noted.\n\n\u201cAs of this moment, our withdrawal fee is between 0.00002 and 0.001 BTC, and the minimum withdrawal amount is 0.0005 BTC,\u201d the spokesperson stated, adding:\n\n\u201cWith regard to implementation of Lightning Network, KuCoin has not yet deployed LN, however, we will actively monitor the market and make adjustments if needed.\u201d\n\nKuCoin\u2019s current Bitcoin withdrawal fees are similar to those implemented on other exchanges like Huobi or Binance.\n\nRelated: Coinbase calls Pepe a \u2018hate symbol,\u2019 prompting calls to boycott the exchange\n\n\u201cOn-chain withdrawal fees are increased due to BTC network congestion. The current withdrawal fee is 0.001 BTC,\u201d a spokesperson for Huobi told Cointelegraph on May 11. Before the increase, the original BTC withdrawal fee was 0.0004 BTC ($11), the representative added. Huobi has also not implemented Lightning yet. \u201cThe Lightning Network is currently under discussion,\u201d the Huobi spokesperson said.\n\nAccording to public information, Binance also charges 0.001 BTC ($27) as a BTC withdrawal fee, while the minimum withdrawal amount is 0.002 BTC, roughly $55.\n\nDespite relatively expensive BTC withdrawal fees, Binance has experienced major withdrawal issues amid the ongoing mempool congestion recently. On May 8, Binance was forced to halt withdrawals twice in 12 hours, with 400,000 transactions stuck in the Bitcoin mempool. The events have pushed Binance to seriously consider implementing the LN.\n\nMultiple exchanges, including Coinbase, Bybit and Crypto.com, didn\u2019t respond to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comment.\n\nMagazine: Asia Express: Justin Sun\u2019s SUI-farming sins, PEPE\u2019s wild run, 3AC\u2019s oyster philosophy"

        "content": "The net effect of the presence of Bitcoin miners on a modern grid is to cut off the tails of the price distribution: they scoop up cheap (or even negatively priced power) when no one is buying it \u2013 helping utilities better monetize \u2013 and they turn off when power is expensive, giving power back to households during grid scarcity events. Miners actively participate in \u201cdemand response\u201d or \u201ccontrollable load\u201d programs in grids that have them, helping stabilize grids as they have a unique ability to react quickly to changing grid conditions and dial up and down their consumption as needed. During the grid strain last winter and in summer 2022 in Texas, miners dialed down their consumption, so energy could flow back to ordinary households. It\u2019s no wonder that Texas governor Greg Abbott has praised miners for their benevolent presence on the ERCOT grid."

Discover SCENE\n\nWith Bitcoin prices still slumped since this time last year, CleanSpark took time during its latest earnings call to assure investors of the firm's financial health.\n\nAccording to statements provided by CleanSpark Inc., the U.S.-based Bitcoin mining company doubled the number of Bitcoin mined last quarter compared with Q2 of last year, but its revenue increased only 14%.\n\nCleanSpark's CFO Gary A. Vecchiarelli said that the stunted revenue growth was largely a result of low Bitcoin prices.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Our revenue per Bitcoin this quarter was approximately $22,700 whereas last year, our revenue per Bitcoin was over $41,000,\" Vecchiarelli said in a conference call.\n\nHe added that the company's improved hash rate makes it \"well positioned to take advantage of even the slightest increase in bitcoin prices.\"\n\nCEO Zach Bradford was quick to bring up the next halving event too.\n\nThe halving refers to the moment when miners\u2019 block rewards will be cut from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin, which is expected to occur sometime next April.\n\n\"Only the most efficient miners will have the production capacity and balance sheets to capitalize on this historic event,\" Bradford said. He added that CleanSpark's current fleet averages 31 watts of electricity per Tera hash, which he expects to bring down as low as 26 watts by the end of the year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCleanSpark and the Bitcoin halving\n\nBradford suggested that for CleanSpark the next halving is the starting line of the race and that the company is \"driving energy into our operational muscles\" in preparation for the event.\n\nCleanSpark's training regimen appears to consist mostly of adding 65,000 more mining computers to their Georgia-based facilities, as well as maintaining low energy costs and building up its Bitcoin reserves.\n\nCleanSpark is reportedly in the process of adding another 20,000 more Bitmain s19 jPro+ miners to its facility in Washington, GA in the coming months, and an additional 45,000 Bitmain XP miners to another facility in Sandersville, GA, by the end of the year.\n\nAccording to Bradford, the added miners will boost the firm's total hash rate to 15.9 EH/s.\n\nWhile bolstering its fleet will certainly improve CleanSpark's ability to rapidly mine Bitcoin, the firm is also striving \u201cto leave the planet better than we found it.\u201d\n\nExecuting on this value is easier said than done, however.\n\nCleanSpark boasts that its mining is largely powered by a renewable energy mix, but also notes that it can't control the energy mix available at certain sites. To make up for some of the fossil fuel power used in its facilities, CleanSpark buys \"renewable energy credits\" through programs like \"Georgia's Simple Solar.\"\n\nEnergy credit programs have, however, been criticized for not truly amounting to a reduction in fossil fuel use.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Carrollton, Texas, --News Direct-- Allied Energy Corporation\n\nAllied Energy Corp (OTC: AGYP), a producing oil and gas company focused on the leasing and reworking of oil and gas reserves in one of the most prolific hydrocarbon area in the United States, is pleased to provide a shareholder update regarding the Company's activities partnering with Enerhash USA at the Thiel Well site in an effort to begin flare gas bitcoin mining.\n\nOn April 26th, CEO George Monteith of Allied Energy received a revised field build out report distributed by Enerhash's personal.\n\nDue to circumstances beyond the Company's control, initial target dates for the Thiel site had to be adjusted. At this time the Company is confident that all challenges have been overcome regarding the initial delays. The Company is pleased with the revised timeline and is thankful to report that thus far everything is proceeding according to plan. To date the following work has been completed:\n\nOperating permits - completed\n\nSite survey - completed\n\nSite planning - completed\n\nElevation study - completed\n\nContractor proposal for site buildout - completed\n\nAllied will update their shareholders as further developments occur with press releases and media updates on Twitter.\n\nThe initial Thiel project, if all goes as planned, is expected to take 8-10 weeks to complete. The generators and data centers will be located 150 feet south of the wellhead. A meter run will be installed just north of the generator pad. The existing water tank will be reused for discharge from the separator. The elevated pad will be constructed of compacted engineered fill to support generator weights up to 60,000 lbs. per generator and 20,000 lbs. per data center. A reinforced concrete pad will be constructed on top of the compacted engineered fill to support the generator / generators. The contractor will provide two 3-inch electrical conduits with sweeping connections from the generators to each data center pad.\n\nStory continues\n\nAllied CEO George Monteith commented: \"The Thiel is the first location where Allied will establish a bitcoin mining footprint in partnership with Enerhash. At this time, we believe that the Thiel site will be a 3-megawatt center and power three containers of bitcoin mining equipment. As per our last release investors / current shareholders can see that we are laying a broader foundation of gas well resources through our new partnership with Sloan Petroleum. Ultimately, we are focused on completing the initial 20-megawatt project with Enerhash to then set our sights toward completion of the 100-megawatt project. I am appreciative of all the hard work my team has given, we have a detailed plan and the resources to make it happen, now it is time to make the push toward mining digital currency.\"\n\nAbout Enerhash:\n\nEnerhash is an energy technology and digital infrastructure development company founded by European energy experts in 2019. Enerhash has developed projects on three continents providing renewable energy optimization and grid balancing services including New Zealand, Sweden, Hungary and now they are entering into the USA.\n\nEnerhash USA will align with energy producers as a solution to help alleviate harmful methane emissions caused by production. These solutions will monetize wasted natural gas resources to reduce emissions by eliminating routine flaring to reach ESG goals and unlock the value from stranded resources. To discover more about Enerhash USA, visit their corporate website at www.enerhashusa.com.\n\nAbout AGYP:\n\nAllied Energy Corp. is an energy development and production company acquiring oil & gas reserves in some of the most prolific hydrocarbon bearing regions of the United States. The Company specializes in the business of reworking & re-completing 'existing' oil & gas wells located in the thousands of mature oil & gas producing fields across the United States. The Company applies its knowledge, experience, and effective well-remediation technologies to achieve higher production volumes, longer well life, and more efficient recovery of the proven and available oil and gas reserves in the fields/projects in which it has acquired an ownership interest. The Company will utilize updated technologies such as hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\"), drilling of lateral (\"horizontal\") legs in productive zones, and utilizing new cased hole electric logging to locate bypassed pays, all to enhance daily rates and oil & gas recoveries. By acquiring interests in a growing number of selected projects in various regions, Allied Energy Corp. is diversifying its exposure and effectively minimizing risk as it pursues corporate growth, top line & bottom-line revenues to the benefit of all stakeholders. There are proven, recoverable reserves contained in the many aging oil & gas fields that have been bypassed by companies moving away from these fields in search of deeper, more plentiful, but more costly reserves. The Company plans to concentrate on bypassed oil and gas as there is less competition and, as mentioned above, the costs are considerably less. Additionally, the company will acquire interests in marginal wells that can be acquired at minimal cost, of which there are 420,000 wells in the U.S. Quoting Barry Russell, President of the Independent Petroleum Association of America (\"IPAA\") - \"With approximately 20 percent of American oil production and 10 percent of American natural gas production coming from marginal wells, they are America's true strategic petroleum reserve.\"\n\nSafe Harbor Statement:\n\nThis Press Release may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

        "content": "What Is Hyperledger?\n\nHyperledger is a global enterprise blockchain project that offers the necessary framework, standards, guidelines, and tools to build open-source blockchains and related applications for use across various industries. Hyperledger's projects include a variety of enterprise-ready permissioned blockchain platforms, where network participants are known to one another and therefore have an intrinsic interest in participating in the consensus-making process.\n\nUsing the available components under the Hyperledger umbrella, a business can apply various modular blockchain solutions and services to significantly improve the performance of their operations and the efficiency of their business processes.\n\nKey Takeaways Hyperledger is an open-source community focused on developing a suite of stable frameworks, tools, and libraries for permissioned, enterprise-grade blockchain deployments.\n\nIt is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation, and includes member organizations that are leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chains, manufacturing, and technology.\n\nSeveral sub-projects exist, including Hyperledger Fabric, Sawtooth, Composer, and Cello.\n\nHyperledger varies from Bitcoin as it is not a cryptocurrency but instead used to develop frameworks and tools.\n\nHyperledger uses a consensus layer, smart contract layer, communication layer, and API.\n\nUnderstanding Hyperledger\n\nThe Hyperledger project was created in December 2015 by the San Francisco, California\u2013based Linux Foundation. It started with 30 member firms and has grown to about 140 member companies today.\n\nHyperledger was set up with the aim of accelerating industry-wide collaboration for developing high-performance and reliable blockchain and distributed ledger-based technology framework that could be used across the various industry sectors to enhance the efficiency, performance, and transactions of the various business processes.\n\nHyperledger is a global collaboration that includes leading businesses from the fields of finance, banking, Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain management, manufacturing and production, and technology. They include big names like Bosch, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Deloitte, Hitachi, American Express, JP Morgan, and Visa, in addition to a host of blockchain-based startups like ConsenSys.\n\nThe Linux Foundation has launched over 70 open sourced organizations with Hyperledger being among the fastest growing.\n\nHyperledger's Organizational Structure\n\nEssentially, Hyperledger is not an organization, a cryptocurrency network, or a blockchain system. It does not support a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, but it works by providing the necessary infrastructure and standards for developing various blockchain-based systems and applications for industrial use. Think of Hyperledger as a hub, where various individual blockchain-based projects and tools that adhere to its defined design philosophy operate under its umbrella.\n\nThe various projects include the following:\n\nHyperledger Fabric is a platform for building various blockchain-based products, solutions, and applications for business use. A now-defunct layer called Hyperledger Composer has since been replaced with Fabric as well.\n\nA now-defunct layer called Hyperledger Composer has since been replaced with Fabric as well. Hyperledger Cello allows blockchain to be used through an on-demand \u201cas-a-service\u201d deployment model (Blockchain-as-a-Service).\n\nHyperledger Explorer is a dashboard utility that allows for the monitoring, searching, and maintenance of blockchain developments and related data.\n\nHyperledger Burrow is a permissioned Ethereum smart-contract blockchain node that handles transactions and executes smart contract code on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It was discontinued in 2022.\n\nHyperledger Sawtooth is an enterprise-level, permissioned, modular blockchain platform that uses an innovative Proof of Elapsed Time consensus algorithm.\n\nHyperledger Caliper is a blockchain benchmark tool that is used to evaluate the performance of a specific blockchain implementation.\n\nAll such projects under the Hyperledger umbrella follow the design methodology that supports a modular and extensible approach, interoperability, and security features. The projects remain agnostic to a particular token or cryptocurrency, though a user can create one as required.\n\nHyperledger was founded in 2016 with 30 founding corporate members.\n\nHyperledger Technology Layers\n\nIn terms of the architecture, Hyperledger uses the following key business components:\n\nThe consensus layer takes care of creating an agreement on the order and confirming the correctness of the set of transactions that constitute a block.\n\nThe smart contract layer is responsible for processing transaction requests and authorizing only valid transactions.\n\nThe communication layer takes care of peer-to-peer message transport.\n\nThe identity management services are the necessary function for maintaining and validating the identities of users and systems and establishing trust on the blockchain.\n\nThe API, or application programming interface, enables external applications and clients to interface with the blockchain.\n\nHyperledger vs. Bitcoin\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Hyperledger is vastly different from Bitcoin in that it is not a cryptocurrency. The fundamental purpose and nature of the technology is to develop enterprise-grade blockchain frameworks and tools. While Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries, Hyperledger is more geared towards facilitating business processes.\n\nHyperledger frameworks are often private, permissioned blockchains meaning permission to the network is limited to a small number of trusted users. On the other hand, Bitcoin is a public blockchain meaning anyone can participate in the network. Each uses a different form of consensus mechanism as well, as Bitcoin transactions are substantiated using a proof-of-work consensus mechanism while Hyperledger supports Byzantine fault tolerance or other algorithms.\n\nAs hinted to in the previous paragraph, Bitcoin is decentralized. This means no single entity owns it, and the system relies on the collection of the network's participants. Alternatively, Hyperledger is governed by the Linux Foundation.\n\nLast, Bitcoin is not known for its smart contracts. It's primary use is to store value, not support complex programmability to facilitate agreements. Alternatively, Hyperledger offers greater smart contract capabilities. This allows businesses to engage in complex agreements relying heavily on logic to distribute assets on a blockchain network.\n\nIs Hyperledger Better Than Ethereum? Hyperledger provides a scalable, customizable, and permissioned blockchain solution for enterprise use cases with a focus on privacy and confidentiality. Should companies feel they need greater support with open development and innovation, Ethereum may be the more suitable option that offers a more robust platform with a larger developer community.\n\nIs Hyperledger a Cryptocurrency? Hyperledger isn't a cryptocurrency, though. The Linux Foundation is hosting a collaborative open-source project with the goal of creating enterprise-grade blockchain frameworks and tools. Hyperledger does not entail the development or use of a cryptocurrency and instead focuses on creating private, permissioned blockchain networks for corporate purposes.\n\nWhat Coin Does Hyperledger Use? There is no native coin for Hyperledger. It is a blockchain framework that puts the emphasis on creating enterprise-grade solutions rather than using or creating a particular coin or cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Linux Foundation is home to the Hyperledger open-source collaborative project which aims to provide business-grade blockchain frameworks and technologies. Businesses may build private, permissioned blockchain networks for a variety of use cases. Hyperledger uses include supply chain management and smart contracts, and Hyperledger is known for its modular and adaptable solutions.\n\n"

        "content": "Whether you are new to cryptocurrencies or a seasoned trader, you may come across headlines such as - \"Bitcoin funding rate plunges to new lows\" or \"Bitcoin prices will surge due to low funding rate\u201d. But what exactly is the funding rate, and why is it important to understand in the grander scheme of things? To answer this, we first need to understand how a futures contract works.\n\nPrerequisites for Understanding Bitcoin funding rates\n\nA futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a specified price and date in the future. However, these contracts have an expiration date, after which the settlement process begins. Unlike a traditional spot market, trades are not \u2018settled\u2019 instantly in the futures market. Instead, parties will trade a contract, that defines the settlement at a future date.\n\nAlso Read: A quick guide on how to make your own meme coin\n\nTraditional futures contracts generally settle on a monthly or quarterly basis. On the settlement date, the trade is made final and the buyer must pay the seller while the seller delivers the assets to the buyer. Settlement refers to the convergence of the contract price with the spot price and the expiration of all open positions. Meanwhile, the spot price represents the price at which a particular commodity can be bought on an exchange at a given time.\n\nPerpetual futures contracts are built on the same principles as traditional futures contracts. The key distinction is that crypto exchanges such as Binance and Bitfinex offer perpetual contracts, allowing traders to hold positions without an expiry date. This eliminates the need to worry about settling the contract on a specific date.\n\nSince perpetual futures contracts don\u2019t have expiry dates, some exchanges employ a method to ensure that future prices and index prices converge at regular intervals. This method is known as the funding rate. Based on open positions, traders either pay or receive funding.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin funding rate?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, perpetual contracts have no expiration date or settlement, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. This makes them unique derivative offerings for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nTraders opt for perpetual contracts to speculate on whether the price of Bitcoin will rise or fall in the future. Those who hold \"long\" positions expect the price to surge in the future, while those with \"short\" positions anticipate that the price will decrease in the future.\n\nIn this context, when traders take either long or short positions, they can influence the price of the perpetual contract, causing it to deviate from the spot price. The funding rate mechanism ensures that the perpetual contract price does not diverge significantly from the spot price.\n\nFor instance, if many traders open long positions and buy a bulk of Bitcoin perpetual contracts, the prices of these contracts can surpass the spot price of Bitcoin. If this happens, the traders who went long would pay the funding rate to those who went short, to keep their positions open.\n\nThe further the perpetual contract price deviates from the spot price, the higher the funding payments they have to make to the shorting traders. This incentivization system is designed to align traders' positions in a way that expects the perpetual contract price and spot price to converge or be relatively close to each other over time.\n\nBitcoin funding rate is made up of regular payments between traders and the same prevents a lasting divergence in the price of both perpetual contract markets and spot prices. Different exchanges readjust the funding rate several times a day. For example, Binance Futures calculate the funding rate of cryptocurrencies every eight hours.\n\nImportance of Bitcoin funding rate\n\nA positive Bitcoin funding rate indicates that more traders are taking long positions and expect Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise in the future. Meanwhile, negative funding rates suggest that more traders are taking short positions and have a bearish outlook.\n\nIt is important to stay updated on this metric because a positive or negative funding rate often precedes Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. In simple terms, if Bitcoin\u2019s funding rate is negative, it means that most market participants expect Bitcoin\u2019s price to fall in the future. The same could force others to dispose of their Bitcoin holdings, leading to a fall in Bitcoin\u2019s price. Conversely, a positive funding rate could spur buying in the market, which could send Bitcoin\u2019s price upwards on the chart. Another thing to note here is that extremely negative and positive funding rates can sometimes act as a precursor to market reversals.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs highlighted above, the Bitcoin funding rate can be a powerful metric to determine Bitcoin\u2019s future price. However, it must be used in conjunction with other metrics to accurately predict market direction. Therefore, investors must it at their own discretion."

        "title": "How to use a crypto hardware wallet - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Investing in cryptocurrencies is widely known to be associated with risk, given the crypto market\u2019s volatility, regulatory dilemmas and high-profile incidents of hacks, scams and fraudulent activities. According to Chainalysis\u2019 midyear report on cryptocurrency-related crimes in 2022, approximately $1.9 billion worth of cryptocurrency was stolen in various hacking incidents and fraudulent activities compared to under $1.2 billion at the same point in 2021.\n\nSafely storing and managing cryptocurrency assets has its own set of challenges, and traders must educate themselves on the best options. As a type of cold storage, a crypto hardware wallet is a physical device designed to securely store cryptocurrencies offline, providing additional layers of security for those who hold large amounts of crypto and want to keep their holdings safe for a long time.\n\nThis article will discuss what a hardware wallet is, how to use one and the benefits of hardware wallets vs. software wallets, and it will answer the lingering question: Should you keep your crypto coins in a hardware wallet? Additionally, there\u2019s information on the available hardware wallets to store your crypto assets safely.\n\nRelated: How to mitigate the security risks associated with crypto payments\n\nWhat is a crypto hardware wallet\n\nCrypto wallets can be broadly classified into two categories: hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are software-based crypto wallets connected to the internet, while cold wallets are physical devices. Cold wallets are considered a more secure storage option than hot software wallets, as they are not connected to the internet and do not interact with potentially vulnerable software and web viruses. Among cold wallets, hardware crypto wallets are considered one of the safest options to store cryptocurrencies.\n\nA hardware wallet is a physical device typically resembling a USB drive or a small plugin device designed to securely store cryptocurrencies and other digital assets such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Hardware wallets do not actually store cryptocurrency; instead, they store the private keys that allow access to the stored digital assets.\n\nOne may check the price, model and specifications as per requirement. Bitcoin (BTC); Ether (ETH); stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC); and other popular digital assets like Ripple\u2019s XRP (XRP) and Litecoin (LTC) are supported by most hardware wallets.\n\nHardware wallet vs Software wallet\n\nWhile software wallets allow ease and convenience, hardware wallets are known for their secure storage. A good understanding of the differences among the two options, user requirements and the level of digital asset custody needed can help users make informed choices on their wallet preference.\n\nHow does a hardware wallet work\n\nBefore understanding how a hardware wallet works, it is essential to have some know-how into crypto wallet keys.\n\nPublic and private crypto wallet keys\n\nCryptocurrency data lives on the blockchain, and crypto wallets store this information. There is no hard money like fiat, and this data on the blockchain determines one\u2019s ownership of the assets.\n\nEvery crypto wallet has a pair of keys to access it \u2014 a private key and a public key. The public key is akin to a bank account number and is free to access by anyone. The private key, however, is like an ATM pin code and must be secured by the user.\n\nPrivate keys give access to the cryptocurrency funds and need to be safeguarded by the owner and should not be shared with anyone. They are a unique combination of letters and numbers, functioning as digital signatures or a password that grants access to and control over the cryptocurrency holdings. Hardware crypto wallets typically store these private keys, which are required for signing transactions.\n\nHardware wallet self custody\n\nWhen users hold their cryptocurrencies on a centralized exchange (CEX), they essentially transfer custody and control of their private keys and digital assets to the exchange while themselves using login credentials provided by the CEX. This implies that users rely on the exchange to securely hold and manage their funds on their behalf, making them vulnerable to scams, hacks and other security threats in the event an exchange comes under attack.\n\nHardware wallets, on the other hand, empower users with full control and self-custody over their digital assets. Users hold their private keys and are not reliant on third-party custodians or exchanges. To engage in cryptocurrency transactions using hardware wallets, the transactions require the private key to be \u201csigned.\u201d This signing process takes place within the hardware wallet itself using a cryptocurrency bridge. A crypto bridge facilitates the connection between the hardware wallet and the blockchain.\n\nThe hardware wallet uploads the signed transaction to the bridge, which in turn broadcasts the signed transaction to the blockchain network. Importantly, at no point during the entire process does the user\u2019s private key leave the hardware wallet, thereby ensuring safety and security.\n\nRelated: What is a Bitcoin Wallet? A beginner's guide to storing BTC\n\nHow to use a hardware crypto wallet\n\nThe exact steps and procedures may vary slightly depending on the specific hardware wallet. Users can refer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and follow security practices to learn how to use a particular hardware wallet.\n\nThe following are some common steps to understand how hardware wallets can be used:\n\nStep 1: Purchase and install software\n\nObtain a crypto hardware wallet from known and reliable manufacturers such as Ledger, Trezor and Ngrave \u2014 and/or their authorized resellers. Ensure that it is sealed and tamper-free. Visit the official website of the hardware wallet manufacturer, then download and install the wallet software on desktop/mobile devices. Make sure to read the recommendations for the device specifications \u2014 operating system, processor, etc.\n\nStep 2: Connect the hardware wallet\n\nConnect the hardware wallet to a desktop/mobile device using the provided USB cable or the appropriate wireless connection (bluetooth or NFC). Follow the on-screen instructions to initialize the hardware wallet. This involves selecting a PIN or passphrase, creating a backup recovery seed phrase and securely storing the seed in multiple offline locations. The recovery seed is crucial for restoring access to funds if the hardware wallet is ever lost or damaged.\n\nStep 3: Add funds and transact\n\nWithin the wallet software, locate the option to receive or deposit cryptocurrencies. Copy the public address displayed or scan the QR code in order to add the desired amount of cryptocurrency to this public address from an exchange or another wallet.\n\nTo send cryptocurrencies from the hardware wallet, select the option to send or transfer funds, and enter the recipient\u2019s address and the amount to send. Confirm the transaction details on the hardware wallet\u2019s screen.\n\nStep 4: Confirm, sign and verify transactions\n\nUpon confirming the transaction details on the hardware wallet, one will be prompted to provide additional authorization by entering a PIN or passphrase. The hardware wallet will then sign the transaction with the private key stored within it, and the funds will be transacted. Track the progress of the transactions using blockchain explorers or within the wallet software. Verify that the transaction has been confirmed and added to the blockchain.\n\nIt is important to remember to securely disconnect the hardware wallet from the desktop/mobile device after completing the transaction and ensure safekeeping.\n\nPopular hardware wallets\n\nHardware cryptocurrency wallets have become increasingly sought after by crypto enthusiasts, investors and crypto whales. These include wallets such as Ledger and Trezor, which offer a secure and user-friendly solution for storing and managing digital assets. Other common names in the market include: Ellipal, CoolWallet, SafePal and Ngrave, among others. Furthermore, certain hardware wallets like Ledger offer staking and other earning opportunities through their Ledger Live app.\n\nThe superiority of hardware wallets in securing cryptocurrencies became even more apparent in 2022 due to the crypto exchange debacles of FTX, Celsius, BlockFi and Vault, which resulted in the loss of access to billions of dollars. As a result, hardware wallet providers like Ledger and Trezor experienced unprecedented sales as crypto holders rushed for storage safety and reliability.\n\nAre hardware crypto wallets secure\n\nFor anyone who has been in the crypto space long enough, there is a common saying: \u201cNot your keys, not your crypto.\u201d In essence, this phrase serves as a call to action for cryptocurrency users to take control of their own security and ensure the protection of their digital assets. It encourages the use of hardware wallets and other cold storage solutions to keep private keys offline and away from potential cyber threats.\n\nCrypto hardware wallets are widely recognized as secure solutions for storing, managing and taking custody of one\u2019s digital assets and cryptocurrencies. Although no security measure can guarantee complete safety, hardware wallets provide additional layers of security and safeguards for storing cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "Is the US government involved with Bitcoin\u2019s recent price drop? - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "On May 11, Bitcoin's price unexpectedly plummeted below $27,000, a support level it had maintained since March 17, amid reports that the US government was allegedly selling its Bitcoin assets. However, it was later reported the \u2018fake\u2019 news might have triggered fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) amongst crypto investors, leading to a sporadic decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price. Here\u2019s a recap of the events that followed in the past few days.\n\nDid the U.S. government sell its BTC holdings?\n\nBitcoin's market had been choppy in recent weeks, moving between the upper and lower bands of $30,000 and $27,000, respectively. However, on May 11, Bitcoin dropped below this lower band and touched $26,723, its lowest point in nearly two months. The dip was mostly unexpected given that the announcement of US inflation statistics on May 10 was followed by a brief uptick in Bitcoin's price.\n\nAlso Read: A quick guide on how to verify your crypto transaction\n\nFollowing Bitcoin's dip, it was reported that news of the US government selling confiscated bitcoins may have caused an unanticipated drop in its price. It is currently unknown where the news came from, however, it is known that various social media accounts were fast to spread the story. During the same day, Coinglass, an analytical platform, revealed that $47 million in long positions were liquidated in less than an hour, the second-largest Bitcoin liquidations in 2023 so far.\n\nThe US government has amassed a sizable stockpile of Bitcoins over the years. The coins were obtained through seizures from the Silk Road marketplace, thefts on the crypto exchange Bitfinex, and James Zhong, who pleaded guilty in 2012 to manipulating the Silk Road transaction system in order to siphon Bitcoins. The government typically sells these Bitcoin confiscations in public auctions conducted by the U.S. Marshals Service. According to Glassnode, the US Government held 205,515 BTC as of 9 March. The same is valued at $5.42 billion based on Bitcoin\u2019s current market price.\n\nWas this just a rumor?\n\nIn the aftermath of Bitcoin\u2019s price drop, several social media accounts argued that recent news of the US government selling its BTC holdings was likely just a rumor which fueled market FUD.\n\nFor instance, social media user and on-chain analyst ZachXBT, searched blockchain addresses to demonstrate that addresses associated with US authorities had not engaged in any such transactions. Later that day, analytical platform CryptoQuant tweeted that several social media accounts spread unverified news without fact-checking, resulting in Bitcoin liquidations.\n\nThere was also a rumor which suggested that the problem was caused by a faulty feature on blockchain analytics platform, Arkham Intelligence. Some argued that user labels used to mark addresses on Arkham Intelligence were responsible for the trouble. The Arkham interface allows users to manually add or remove labels to modify data sets, which may have led some clients to misuse this feature. However, the platform later denied these rumors. It also confirmed that it had identified seven Bitcoin wallets associated with the US government, and none of them were involved in any BTC transactions of late.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain whether the US government has sold any of its Bitcoin assets this week until an official statement is issued. However, according to some on-chain experts, the same remains a rumor for the time being. At the time of writing, Bitcoin\u2019s price traded at $26,420, down by 3.5 percent over the last 24 hours and down by 9 percent over the last 7 days."

        "title": "Why Is Bitcoin And The Crypto Market Down Today? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin price continues to fall, dragging the broader crypto market down with it. BTC is down 4.52% in the last 24 hours, while ETH is down 4.10%. With a current price of $26,289, Bitcoin records its lowest value since March 14 this year, when the price dipped as low as $26,544.\n\nWhy Is Bitcoin And Crypto Down?\n\nAs always, the reasons for the deep pullback of the Bitcoin price are complex. Remarkably, there was actually good news on Wednesday, May 10, as the CPI continued to fall causing the Bitcoin price to rise as high as $28,317.\n\nHowever, then fake news about an alleged sale of 9,800 BTC by the U.S. government shook the market. The Bitcoin price flash crashed as a result and has seemingly not been able to recover since. But this narrative is only half the story.\n\nA variety of other factors are currently weighing on the crypto market: the dollar index (DXY) is currently experiencing a bounce and was recently able to hold above the historically important support, the liquidity issue intensified once again with the departure of US market makers Jump and Jane Street, BTC formed a (supposed) head and shoulders pattern in the 1-day chart, the congestion of the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains and last but not least a lot of FUD (US government selling, Binance US and Grayscale).\n\nNot surprisingly, uncertainty in the Bitcoin and crypto market is currently quite high. The Dollar Index (DXY) is currently hovering above historically crucial support at 101.8. Since early April, DXY has already been suspiciously close to support, but has so far been able to fend off any attack from the bears.\n\nAs Christopher Inks of Texas Wet Capital writes, the DXY saw another move higher yesterday (to 102.056) and is currently preventing a rally in risk assets:\n\nThe $DXY rally is making longs difficult this morning. So, if you\u2019re trying to get long on risk-off assets it\u2019s best to wait and watch for a bit.\n\nLiquidity Issues, A Bearish Chart Pattern And FUD\n\nAnother bitter blow to the crypto market on Tuesday was the news of Jump and Jane Street\u2019s departure from the U.S. crypto market. The move by the two major market makers comes as a result of regulatory uncertainty in the US.\n\nAs NewsBTC reported, liquidity has been a huge problem before, which could now get worse. Due to low liquidity, higher volatility is likely as larger buy and sell orders move the market faster.\n\nIn addition, a (supposed) head and shoulders pattern on Bitcoin\u2019s 1-day chart is currently causing fear among traders. The pattern may signal a crash to $25,000.\n\nRemember the bearish diamond pattern that everyone was shilling at 21-22k? It\u2019s H&S now, just saying! https://t.co/2HlUIZ1XrJ pic.twitter.com/yyivuwcF82 \u2014 tedtalksmacro (@tedtalksmacro) May 12, 2023\n\nAdding to the uncertainty has certainly been the congestion of the Bitcoin blockchain by Ordinals and the controversial BRC-20 meme coins, which are seen as a DDoS attack by part of the community. Although 300,000 transactions are still waiting for confirmation in the mempool, the problem is slowly easing.\n\nThe popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals transactions is declining. Trading volume has dropped for three consecutive days after reaching an all-time high of $18.13 million on May 8. Yesterday, trading volume fell to $4.86 million. The number of transactions has also dropped from 17,000 to 6,000. UniSat\u2019s market share has dropped from 80-90% to 50-60% currently.\n\n#Bitcoin block size war 2.0? \ud83d\udc40 According to Dune data, transactions through Unisat have grown exponentially since the beginning of May. \ud83d\udea8 Unisat, the core wallet of BRC20, is developed by a Chinese development team of the BSV community. pic.twitter.com/DfW46mbhZb \u2014 Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) May 11, 2023\n\nLast but not least, there are currently some unconfirmed rumors (FUD) circulating about Binance US and Grayscale. Binance US caused a stir in the last few days because the Bitcoin price showed a high price premium. The reasons have been the subject of much speculation.\n\nGrayscale is currently being hotly debated because DCG supposedly owes bankrupt crypto lender Genesis Trading about $575 million in May, with the loans coming due next week. The rumor says that Grayscale may be selling something on Coinbase to cover the capital needed to repay the loan.\n\nAt press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $26,289, initially receiving support from the 100-day EMA.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin Records Impressive 72.4% QoQ Gains, Emerges As Top-Performing Asset In Q1 2023 | News - FOCUS ON Business",
        "content": "Over the past few months, Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a surge in value that has left all other major asset classes trailing. Per a BitcoinCasinos.com report, the premier cryptocurrency had an impressive 72.4% quarter-over-quarter gain in Q1 2023.\n\nComparatively, the NASDAQ index jumped 15.7%, while gold had an 8.4% increase. Buoyed by positive inflation data, the US Dollar Index (DXY) remained fairly unchanged. And while all major asset classes ended the quarter with positive returns, crude oil decreased by 6.1%.\n\nAccording to BitcoinCasinos financial expert Edith Reads, Bitcoin\u2019s Q1 performance is a testament to its resilience and growth potential amidst a volatile and uncertain global market. Since its inception, BTC has been battling several hurdles, including regulatory crackdowns, hacking incidents, and market fluctuations.\n\nEdith explains,\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s impressive gains clearly indicate its resilience despite the volatile market conditions. With the increasing institutional adoption and global recognition, the asset class is proving to be a reliable store of value for investors and traders alike.\u201d\n\nReasons For Bitcoin\u2019s QoQ Surge\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the coin\u2019s impressive performance during this period. The first is the growing number of institutional investments, which have been pouring in since the end of last year. This influx of capital has helped to stabilize the market and create a better sense of security for investors, leading to increased market confidence.\n\nAdditionally, BTC\u2019s value surge could have resulted from broader macroeconomic trends. These include inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions, leading investors to seek alternative investment options.\n\nMoreover, recent developments in the regulatory environment have also played a significant role in boosting Bitcoin\u2019s fortunes. With major countries such as the US and the UK regulating cryptocurrency, more investors feel comfortable jumping on board, further propelling its upward trajectory.\n\nFinally, the surge in the coin\u2019s value is also driven by increased demand from retail investors looking to diversify their portfolios with alternative investments such as cryptocurrency. This demand is further fueled by the growing adoption of blockchain technology, easing crypto investments.\n\nIs BTC A Viable Longterm Investment?\n\nThe latest surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value raises questions about whether it is a viable investment for the future. It is worth noting that while Bitcoin\u2019s Q1 gains are remarkable, the cryptocurrency is still facing significant challenges.\n\nOf course, no investment is without risk, and Bitcoin\u2019s unpredictability is still a cause for concern for some investors. However, with the cryptocurrency market as a whole stabilizing and BTC continuing to post impressive gains, it will likely remain a strong investment option for those looking for high returns.\n\nWould-be investors must remember that the cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and longevity is uncertain.\n\nBitcoinCasinos"

        "content": "Article Summary\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value has dropped by 10% this week, and liquidity is thin, even for large assets like Bitcoin, causing concern among investors.\n\nExperts believe that Bitcoin\u2019s recent drop could lead to further declines towards $25,000, which is a significant support area, and a drop below this level could be disastrous for uptrend buyers.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has subpoenaed Marathon Digital, a Bitcoin mining firm, for alleged violations of securities laws, as part of an ongoing investigation into a data center in Montana. Despite this, Bitcoin is considered to be the most decentralized and resilient of all cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin fell below $26,200 on Friday as the market continued to react to falling risky asset prices. The flagship cryptocurrency lost a tenth of its value this week, trading at two-week lows.\n\nCurrently, liquidity appears to be \u201cvery thin,\u201d even for large crypto assets like Bitcoin. Market indicators cannot pinpoint a direct reason for the weakness, but concerns that reduced participation by institutional market makers could lead to more price volatility have pushed mid-to-larger bids to stomp the market, making it fall.\n\nRecently, liquidity or market depth has deteriorated on major exchanges, including Binance, making it difficult for traders to fill large orders without impacting prices.\n\nExperts believe Bitcoin\u2019s drop to two-month lows has confirmed a bearish head-and-shoulders reversal pattern on technical charts. This breakdown opens every door for further declines toward the support near $25,000.\n\nBackstory\n\nAfter a failed breakout in early April, the price is firming below the $30,000 resistance level. The downward pressure over the past few days has also pushed the 50-day moving average to break near $28,000.\n\nThe $25,000 support area could be the next target, followed by the next important 200-day moving average near $22,000. Both are significant, and a drop below these levels would be disastrous for uptrend buyers.\n\nOn the other hand, a further breakout above the 50-day moving average will likely thwart the downside scenario, which, in turn, will likely push the price above $30,000.\n\nAt the regulatory level, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has targeted prominent Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital for alleged violations of securities laws that further added pressure on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings has announced that it has been subpoenaed by the SEC for alleged securities law violations as part of an ongoing investigation into a data center in Montana.\n\nMarathon Digital, the second-largest listed Bitcoin miner in the United States, has been subpoenaed by the SEC to produce documents and information related to its operations. Marathon has announced its intention to cooperate fully with the SEC\u2019s investigation.\n\nBut of all the crypto assets, Bitcoin is the most decentralized and resilient given what happened when China completely banned cryptocurrency trading. The mining business was just offshored, and now China\u2019s bitcoin mining has resumed, producing the second-highest hash power in the world.\n\nWhat you should know and expect in the nearest future\n\nThe banking crisis won\u2019t go away anytime soon, and it could get worse. The US economy could face a major collapse later this year and into 2024, and the war between Russia and Ukraine is still raging."

        "title": "Crypto's Tale of Two Tokens: Bitcoin vs. Binance Coin and the Rise of PAT WARS - TechCabal",
        "content": "Crypto has tumbled through a bumpy ride in the past few months, and institutional investors are looking at it warily due to its volatile nature. However, Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s Elliot Han suggests that institutional investors\u2019 interest is still strong and is even maturing. In this article, we\u2019ll compare and analyze the similarities and differences between two major projects in the same industry, Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB), and discuss how they relate to investments, decentralized finance, governments, and digital assets. In addition, we will also be looking at PAT WARS (PAWS) , a new meme coin, and why it\u2019s attracting the attention of institutional investors.\n\nBitcoin and Binance: Decentralization, Market Cap, and Regulatory Landscape\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB) are both digital assets that operate using blockchain technology. Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by any government or financial institution. The Binance Chain, started by Binance, has evolved into a decentralized blockchain ecosystem that is now community-led, open to all, and operates without requiring permission.\n\nOne of the main differences between Bitcoin and Binance is their market capitalization. As of May 2023, Bitcoin has a market cap of around $1.1 trillion, while BNB\u2019s market cap is over $48 billion.\n\nBTC and BNB are two of the major players in the crypto market, and as such, have had to face many challenges. Governments have had mixed reactions to the DeFi nature of these coins, with some viewing them as a potential threat to their centralized financial systems while others have embraced them as digital assets.\n\nBitcoin vs Binance: Two Titans of Crypto Investing for Seasoned Traders\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Binance are popular choices for seasoned investors looking to expand their portfolios. Institutional investors have been slow to embrace cryptocurrencies, but their interest in the space is growing. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are two large banks that began experimenting with blockchain technology a few years ago and are still interested in the market, according to Han. However, Han warns that there is still a high level of volatility, uncertainty, and regulatory action that needs to be taken into account before investing in certain coins.\n\nPAWSitive Investment: How PATWARS is Winning Institutional Interest in DeFi\n\nWith institutional investors\u2019 interest in Decentralized finance (DeFi) increasing, PAT WARS (PAWS) emerges as a promising new meme token in the DeFi space. PAWS\u2019s brand message resonates with decentralization, prioritizing user governance in addition to community-driven decision-making. Through PATWARS DAO, users can vote on initiatives which promote community engagement and ensure the token\u2019s long-term success and sustainability. The governance model\u2019s transparency and adherence to DeFi principles are crucial for PAT WARS\u2019s success.\n\nAs the crypto market matures, BTC and BNB remain two of the top players in the industry. While they have their differences, both offer unique opportunities for seasoned traders looking to invest in digital assets. As institutional investors show growing interest in the space, new tokens like PAT WARS are emerging in the DeFi sector, offering new and promising investment opportunities!\n\nClick the Links Below for More Information on PATWARS!\n\nWebsite: https://www.patwars.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PATWARSOfficial\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/PATWARSOfficial\n\nShare this article"

        "content": "As the majority of the cryptocurrency sector continues to trend sideways or downwards, its representative asset \u2013 Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 has reached the lowest supply on crypto exchanges in more than five years, indicating that crypto traders and investors are increasingly turning to self-custody.\n\nSpecifically, the amount of Bitcoin on crypto exchanges has reached 5.84%, the first time since December 2017 that the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) has dropped below 6%, the blockchain and social metrics platform Santiment said in a tweet on May 9.\n\nBitcoin supply on exchanges. Source: Santiment\n\nAccording to the information retrieved from aggregated derivative exchange data platform Coinglass, there was only 1.89 million BTC on all exchanges as of May 11, 2023, demonstrating a 14.87% decline over the year, as the balance on exchanges on May 11, 2022, stood at 2.22 million BTC.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nAs the platform explained, the trend of moving a digital asset off exchanges and into personal crypto wallets in such large amounts represented \u201ca good sign of increased interest in self-custody for traders, and less potentially at risk\u201d of selling back to exchange wallets.\n\nOn top of that, it demonstrates the growing need for investors to have full control over their cryptocurrency assets and provide assurance that they are safe in case history repeats itself and the FTX scenario, which has caused fear among many, happens again.\n\nBesides these signals, the decreasing amount of Bitcoin on crypto exchanges could be a bullish sign, indicating there is a substantial buying trend, as continued accumulation by hodlers could cause the price of the maiden cryptocurrency to rise.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time changing hands at the price of $27,450, down 0.40% in the last 24 hours, in addition to dropping 5.31% across the previous seven days and losing 7.45% to its value in the past month, as per data retrieved on May 11.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nNotably, the negative trend has continued despite Bitcoin briefly breaking through the $28,000 level after the latest consumer price index (CPI) report showed that the inflation in the United States had slowed down more than expected in April, as Finbold reported on May 10.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
