        "title": "Bitcoin hits its highest level in a year - CNN",
        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nBitcoin on Friday shot up to its highest level in about a year.\n\nThe cryptocurrency rose above $31,400 a coin on Friday, its highest level since 2022, before paring back its gains. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, earlier this week traded above $30,000 for the first time since April, when the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank sent investors in search of safer places to hold their cash.\n\nBitcoin is up by about 87% this year. Its most recent gains come after a wave of interest in crypto from financial giants. BlackRock last week applied to register a bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund, according to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Crypto exchange EDX Markets, backed by firms such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity Digital Assets and Citadel Securities, also launched its digital asset trading platform this week.\n\nStill, the renewed fervor for crypto comes against a backdrop of regulatory crackdowns. The SEC earlier this month sued Coinbase, the US\u2019s largest crypto exchange, alleging that it is acting as an unregistered broker. That came just a day after federal regulators sued Binance, accusing the company of operating an illegal exchange in the United States and commingling customers\u2019 assets.\n\nDespite its surge this year, bitcoin remains well below its all-time highs of more than $60,000 in 2021. The cryptocurrency was hammered last year by the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive pace of interest rates and the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which helped spur a sweeping sell-off in the crypto market."

        "content": "Alyssa Blackburn, a data scientist at Rice University and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, has spent several years performing digital detective work with her trusty lab assistant, Hail Mary, a shiny black computer with orange trim. She has been collecting and analyzing leaks from the Bitcoin blockchain, the immutable public ledger that has recorded all transactions since the cryptocurrency\u2019s launch in January 2009.\n\nBitcoin represents a techno-utopian dream. Satoshi Nakamoto, its pseudonymous inventor, proposed that the world run not on centralized financial institutions but on an egalitarian, math-based electronic money system distributed through a computer network. And the system would be \u201ctrustless\u201d \u2014 that is, it would not rely on a trusted party, such as a bank or government, to arbitrate transactions. Rather, as Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in a 2008 white paper, the system would be anchored in \u201ccryptographic proof instead of trust.\u201d Or, as T-shirts proclaim: \u201cIn Code We Trust.\u201d\n\nThe practicalities have proved complicated. Price turbulence is enough to induce the Bitcoin bends, and the system is environmentally destructive, since the computational network uses exorbitant amounts of electricity.\n\nMs. Blackburn said her project was agnostic to Bitcoin\u2019s pros and cons. Her goal was to pierce the scrim of anonymity, track the transaction flow from Day 1 and study how the world\u2019s largest cryptoeconomy emerged."

        "title": "Almost no one uses Bitcoin as currency, new data proves. It's actually more like gambling - The Conversation",
        "content": "Bitcoin boosters like to claim Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are becoming mainstream. There\u2019s a good reason to want people to believe this.\n\nThe only way the average punter will profit from crypto is to sell it for more than they bought it. So it\u2019s important to talk up the prospects to build a \u201cfear of missing out\u201d.\n\nThere are loose claims that a large proportion of the population \u2013 generally in the range of 10% to 20% \u2013 now hold crypto. Sometimes these numbers are based on counting crypto wallets, or on surveying wealthy people.\n\nBut the hard data on Bitcoin use shows it is rarely bought for the purpose it ostensibly exists: to buy things.\n\nLittle use for payments\n\nThe whole point of Bitcoin, as its creator \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d stated in the opening sentence of the 2008 white paper outlining the concept, was that:\n\nA purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\n\nThe latest data demolishing this idea comes from Australia\u2019s central bank.\n\nEvery three years the Reserve Bank of Australia surveys a representative sample of 1,000 adults about how they pay for things. As the following graph shows, cryptocurrency is making almost no impression as a payments instrument, being used by no more than 2% of adults.\n\nPayment methods being used by Australians\n\nReserve Bank calculations of Australians' awareness vs use of different payment methods, based on Ipsos data.\n\nBy contrast more recent innovations, such as \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d services and PayID, are being used by around a third of consumers.\n\nThese findings confirm 2022 data from the US Federal Reserve, showing just 2% of the adult US population made a payment using a cryptocurrrency, and Sweden\u2019s Riksbank, showing less than 1% of Swedes made payments using crypto.\n\nThe problem of price volatility\n\nOne reason for this, and why prices for goods and services are virtually never expressed in crypto, is that most fluctuate wildly in value. A shop or cafe with price labels or a blackboard list of their prices set in Bitcoin could be having to change them every hour.\n\nThe following graph from the Bank of International Settlements shows changes in the exchange rate of ten major cryptocurrencies against the US dollar, compared with the Euro and Japan\u2019s Yen, over the past five years. Such volatility negates cryptocurrency\u2019s value as a currency.\n\nCryptocurrency\u2019s volatile ways\n\nThere have been attempts to solve this problem with so-called \u201cstablecoins\u201d. These promise to maintain steady value (usually against the US dollar).\n\nBut the spectacular collapse of one of these ventures, Terra, once one of the largest cryptocurrencies, showed the vulnerability of their mechanisms. Even a company with the enormous resources of Facebook owner Meta has given up on its stablecoin venture, Libra/Diem.\n\nThis helps explain the failed experiments with making Bitcoin legal tender in the two countries that have tried it: El Salvador and the Central African Republic. The Central African Republic has already revoked Bitcoin\u2019s status. In El Salvador only a fifth of firms accept Bitcoin, despite the law saying they must, and only 5% of sales are paid in it.\n\nRead more: One year on, El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment has proven a spectacular failure\n\nStoring value, hedging against inflation\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s isn\u2019t used for payments, what use does it have?\n\nThe major attraction \u2013 one endorsed by mainstream financial publications \u2013 is as a store of value, particularly in times of inflation, because Bitcoin has a hard cap on the number of coins that will ever be \u201cmined\u201d.\n\nAs Forbes writers argued a few weeks ago:\n\nIn terms of quantity, there are only 21 million Bitcoins released as specified by the ASCII computer file. Therefore, because of an increase in demand, the value will rise which might keep up with the market and prevent inflation in the long run.\n\nThe only problem with this argument is recent history. Over the course of 2022 the purchasing power of major currencies (US, the euro and the pound) dropped by about 7-10%. The purchasing power of a Bitcoin dropped by about 65%.\n\nSpeculation or gambling?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has always been volatile, and always will be. If its price were to stabilise somehow, those holding it as a speculative punt would soon sell it, which would drive down the price.\n\nBut most people buying Bitcoin essentially as a speculative token, hoping its price will go up, are likely to be disappointed. A BIS study has found the majority of Bitcoin buyers globally between August 2015 and December 2022 have made losses.\n\nThe \u201cmarket value\u201d of all cryptocurrencies peaked at US$3 trillion in November 2021. It is now about US$1 trillion.\n\nBitcoins\u2019s highest price in 2021 was about US$60,000; in 2022 US$40,000 and so far in 2023 only US$30,000. Google searches show that public interest in Bitcoin also peaked in 2021. In the US, the proportion of adults with internet access holding cryptocurrencies fell from 11% in 2021 to 8% in 2022.\n\nRead more: What is Bitcoin's fundamental value? That's a good question\n\nUK government research published in 2022 found that 52% of British crypto holders owned it as a \u201cfun investment\u201d, which sounds like a euphemism for gambling. Another 8% explicitly said it was for gambling.\n\nThe UK parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee, a group of MPs who examine economics and financial issues, has strongly recommended regulating cryptocurrency as form of gambling rather than as a financial product. They argue that continuing to treat \u201cunbacked crypto assets as a financial service will create a \u2018halo\u2019 effect that leads consumers to believe that this activity is safer than it is, or protected when it is not\u201d.\n\nRead more: Crypto trading: politicians who say it should be treated like gambling are completely wrong\n\nWhatever the merits of this proposal, the UK committtee\u2019s underlying point is solid. Buying crypto does have more in common with gambling than investing. Proceed at your own risk, and and don\u2019t \u201cinvest\u201d what you can\u2019t afford to lose."

        "content": "Interest in Central Bank Digital Currencies Picks Up in Latin America and the Caribbean While Crypto Use Varies\n\nCBDCs\u2014if well designed\u2014could lower remittances\u2019 costs and improve financial inclusion. But for crypto assets to safely remain part of the payment system, they need to be regulated.\n\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are at the forefront of digital money adoption, offering valuable lessons for the rest of the world. While El Salvador has made headlines by granting legal tender status to Bitcoin, other LAC countries have made significant strides in the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to either enhance financial inclusion and payment systems\u2019 resilience or lower cross-border remittances\u2019 costs, as our recent research shows.\n\nThe Bahamas pioneered the introduction of a CBDC with the Sand Dollar in 2020, and the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) and Jamaica have followed suit. Brazil\u2019s CBDC project is also in the advanced Proof-of-Concept stage, seeking to enhance \u201casset tokenization\u201d by turning assets, such real estate, stocks, and commodities, into digital representations to facilitate their transfer and increase their liquidity.\n\nNotably, four Latin American countries\u2014Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Ecuador\u2014ranked in 2022 among the top 20 in global adoption of crypto assets. They seek the benefits that digital assets claim to offer, including protection against uncertain domestic macroeconomic conditions, circumvention of capital controls, improved financial inclusion for unbanked populations, cheaper and faster payments, and stronger competition.\n\nHowever, crypto asset adoption also presents numerous challenges and risks, particularly for vulnerable LAC countries with a history of macroeconomic instability, low institutional credibility, substantial capital flows, corruption, and extensive informal sectors. Twelve out of nineteen jurisdictions in the region surveyed for our paper in mid-2022 either already have a special regulatory framework in place or are in the process of creating one.\n\nAdopting crypto\n\nRegulation of crypto assets varies across LAC countries. While El Salvador has made Bitcoin legal tender\u2014declared by law to be a valid payment instrument to settle transactions and financial obligations\u2014other countries like Argentina and the Dominican Republic have prohibited the use of crypto assets due to concerns about their impact on financial stability, currency and asset substitution, tax evasion, corruption, and money laundering.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s experience with Bitcoin suggests there are risks to adopting unbacked crypto assets\u2014those that rely on supply and demand rather than on any asset for value and that are subject to significant price volatility\u2014even when explicitly supported by the government. A 2022 national survey suggests that Bitcoin is still not a widely accepted medium of exchange in El Salvador, despite its legal tender status and substantial government incentives.\n\nEffective adoption of stablecoins\u2014crypto assets that aim to have a stable price relative to a specified asset\u2014can also pose challenges, as demonstrated by Meta\u2019s pilot project. It would have allowed users in the US and Guatemala to make domestic and cross-border payments without fees through its digital wallet, the Novi. While potentially reducing costs of cross-border payments, the project also posed the risk of domestic currency substitution in Guatemala. It was wound down in 2022 amid Western regulatory pushback against Meta\u2019s expansion into cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe promise of CBDCs\n\nMost central banks in LAC are analyzing the potential introduction of CBDCs, with some island nations having already issued their own. According to our survey with government officials in the region, half of the respondents were considering both retail (i.e., designed for the general public) and wholesale (i.e., intended for use by financial institutions) CBDC options.\n\nMost survey participants viewed CBDCs as a means to enhance their payment systems and broaden their access. They deemed financial inclusion and monetary sovereignty as crucial factors in favor of retail CBDC issuance by facilitating the integration of unbanked individuals and curbing currency substitution towards stablecoins or crypto assets.\n\nOn top of these objectives, the central banks of the ECCU and the Bahamas have issued their own CBDCs to boost financial inclusion for communities in remote islands and to strengthen the resilience of the payments system to natural disasters and pandemics. A slow take-up and disruptions in access to CBDCs in these countries highlight the importance of investing in public awareness and robust infrastructure to promote the adoption of CBDCs.\n\nManaging risks\n\nCrypto assets present risks that vary by country circumstances. The IMF has provided guidance on key elements of an appropriate policy response to mitigate the risks while also harnessing the potential benefits of the technological innovation associated with crypto assets.\n\nIf well designed, CBDCs can strengthen the usability, resilience, and efficiency of payment systems and increase financial inclusion in LAC.\n\nWhile a few countries have completely banned crypto assets given their risks, this approach may not be effective in the long run. The region should instead focus on addressing the drivers of crypto demand, including citizens\u2019 unmet digital payment needs, and on improving transparency, by recording crypto asset transactions in national statistics.\n\n****\n\nRina Bhattacharya is a senior economist, Dmitry Vasilyev is an economist, and Mauricio Villafuerte is a division chief in the IMF\u2019s Western Hemisphere Department."

        "title": "Paradise lost? How crypto failed to deliver on its promises and what to do about it - European Central Bank",
        "content": "Speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a panel on the future of crypto at the 22nd BIS Annual Conference, 23 June 2023\n\nIntroduction\n\nSome 15 years ago, software developers using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto created the source code of what they thought could be decentralised digital cash.[1] Since then, crypto has relied on constantly creating new narratives to attract new investors, revealing incompatible views of what crypto-assets are or ought to be.\n\nThe vision of digital cash \u2013 of a decentralised payment infrastructure based on cryptography \u2013 went awry when blockchain networks became congested in 2017, resulting in soaring transaction fees.[2]\n\nSubsequently, the narrative of digital gold gained momentum, sparking a \u201ccrypto rush\u201d that led to one in five adults in the United States and one in ten in Europe speculating on crypto, with a peak market capitalisation of \u20ac2.5 trillion.[3]\n\nHowever, this illusion of crypto-assets serving as easy money and a robust store of value dissipated with the onset of the crypto winter in November 2021. The fall in the price of cryptos (Chart 1) led to a decrease of around \u20ac2 trillion worth of crypto assets within less than a year. This caught millions of investors unprepared.[4] An estimated three-quarters of bitcoin users suffered losses on their initial investments at this time.[5]\n\nChart 1 Prices of bitcoin and selected altcoins (USD thousands) Source: CryptoCompare. Notes: The data are for the period from 1 January 2015 to 15 June 2023 and are based on the price of crypto-assets as in the Crypto Coin Comparison Aggregated Index (CCCAGG) provided by CryptoCompare. The altcoins\u2019 names are abbreviated as follows: Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Polkadot (DOT), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), Dogecoin (DOGE), Binance Coin (BNB), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Uniswap (UNI), Solana (SOL).\n\nUnderstandably, many are now questioning the future of crypto-assets.\n\nBut the bursting of the bubble does not necessarily spell the end of crypto-assets.[6] People like to gamble and investing in crypto offers them a way to do so.[7]\n\nCrypto valuations are highly volatile, reflecting the absence of any intrinsic value. This makes them particularly sensitive to changes in risk appetite and market narratives. The recent developments that have affected leading crypto-asset exchanges have highlighted the contradictions of a system which, though created to counteract the centralisation of the financial system, has become highly centralised itself.\n\nToday I will contend that due to their limitations, cryptos have not developed into a form of finance that is innovative and robust, but have instead morphed into one that is deleterious. The crypto ecosystem is riddled with market failures and negative externalities, and it is bound to experience further market disruptions unless proper regulatory safeguards are put in place.\n\nPolicymakers should be wary of supporting an industry that has so far produced no societal benefits and is increasingly trying to integrate into the traditional financial system, both to acquire legitimacy as part of that system and to piggyback on it. Instead, regulators should subject cryptos to rigorous regulatory standards, address their social cost, and treat unsound crypto models for what they truly are: a form of gambling.\n\nThis may prompt the ecosystem to make more effort to provide genuine value in the field of digital finance.\n\nShifting narratives: from decentralised payments to centralised gambling\n\nThe core promise of cryptos is to replace trust with technology, contending that the concept \u201ccode is law\u201d will allow a self-policing system to emerge, free of human judgement and error. This would in turn make it possible for money and finance to operate without trusted intermediaries.\n\nHowever, this narrative often obfuscates reality. Unbacked cryptos have made no inroads into the conventional role of money. And they have progressively moved away from their original goal of decentralisation to increasingly rely on centralised solutions and market structures. They have become speculative assets[8], as well as a means of circumventing capital controls, sanctions or financial regulation.\n\nBlockchain limitations\n\nA key reason why cryptos have failed to make good on their claim to perform the role of money is technical. Indeed, the use of blockchain \u2013 particularly in the form of public, permissionless blockchain \u2013 for transacting crypto-assets has exhibited significant limitations.[9]\n\nTransacting cryptos on blockchains can be inefficient, slow and expensive; they face the blockchain trilemma, whereby aiming for optimal levels of security, scalability and decentralisation at the same time is not achievable.[10]\n\nCrypto-assets relying on a proof-of-work validation mechanism, which is especially relevant for bitcoin as the largest crypto-asset by market capitalisation[11], are ecologically detrimental. Public authorities will therefore need to evaluate whether the outsized carbon footprint of certain crypto-assets undermines their green transition commitments.[12] Moreover, proof-of-work validation mechanisms are inadequate for large-scale use.[13] Bitcoin, for example, can only accommodate up to seven transactions per second and fees can be exorbitant.\n\nWhile alternative solutions to overcome the blockchain trilemma and proof-of-work consensus shortcomings have emerged for faster and more affordable transactions, including those outside the blockchain, they have drawbacks of their own. \"Off-chain\" transactions conducted via third-party platforms compromise the core principles of crypto-assets, including security, validity and immutability.[14] Another important aspect is the operational risk inherent in public blockchains due to the absence of an accountable central governance body that manages operations, incidents or code errors.[15]\n\nMoreover, the handling of crypto-assets can be challenging. In a decentralised blockchain, users must protect their personal keys using self-custody wallets, which can discourage widespread adoption due to the tasks and risks involved, for example the theft or loss of a key. Given the immutability of blockchains, they do not permit transaction reversal.[16]\n\nInstability\n\nAnother key limitation of unbacked cryptos is their instability.\n\nUnbacked cryptos lack intrinsic value and have no backing reserves or price stabilisation mechanisms.[17] This makes them inherently highly volatile and unsuitable as a means of payment. Bitcoin, for instance, exhibits volatility levels up to four times higher than stocks, or gold (Chart 2).\n\nChart 2 Price volatility of cryptos compared with other assets (annualised seven-day rolling standard deviation of daily percentage changes of prices) Sources: CryptoCompare, Bloomberg, Refinitiv and ECB calculations. Notes: The data are for the period from 1 January 2015 to 15 June 2023. For visibility reasons, the maximum of the y-axis for Chart 2, panel b is set to 5. Nevertheless, on 30 and 31 January 2021 the price volatility of DOGE exceeded 28. Oil data refer to the European Brent Spot price. The altcoins\u2019 names are abbreviated as follows: Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Polkadot (DOT), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), Dogecoin (DOGE), Binance Coin (BNB), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Uniswap (UNI), Solana (SOL).\n\nSuch high volatility also means that households cannot rely on crypto-assets as a store of value to smooth their consumption over time. Similarly, firms cannot rely on crypto-assets as a unit of account for the calculation of prices or for their balance sheet.\n\nMoreover, unbacked cryptos do not improve our capacity to hedge against inflation. Indeed, their price developments exhibit an increasing correlation with stock markets (Chart 3). And empirical analysis finds that momentum in the crypto-asset market and global financial market volatility do have an impact on bitcoin trading against fiat currencies.[18]\n\nChart 3 Returns correlations of bitcoin vis-\u00e0-vis selected financial assets (yearly rolling correlation) Sources: Bloomberg, S&P Global iBoxx, CryptoCompare and ECB calculations. Notes: The data are for the period from 1 January 2016 to 16 June 2023.\n\nCryptos as a means of gambling and circumvention\n\nBut the very instability of unbacked cryptos does make them appealing as a means of gambling. And their use as such has been facilitated by the establishment of a centralised market structure that supports the broader use of crypto-assets.[19]\n\nCrypto exchanges have become gateways into the crypto ecosystem, often providing user access to crypto markets in conjunction with other services like wallets, custody, staking[20] or lending. Off-chain grids or third-party platforms have offered users easy and cost-effective ways to engage in trading and speculation, while stablecoins are being used to bridge the gap between fiat and crypto by promising a stable value relative to fiat currency.[21]\n\nBesides gambling, crypto assets are also being used for bypassing capital controls, sanctions and traditional financial regulation. A prime example is bitcoin, which is used to circumvent taxes and regulations, in particular to evade restrictions on international capital flows and foreign exchange transactions, including on remittances.[22] These practices may have destabilising macroeconomic implications in some jurisdictions, notably in developing and emerging markets.\n\nRisks from the growing centralisation of the crypto ecosystem\n\nThe crypto ecosystem\u2019s move away from its original goals towards more centralised forms of organisation, typically without regulatory oversight, is giving rise to substantial costs and an array of contradictions. There are two major facets to this phenomenon.\n\nThe re-emergence of classic financial sector shortcomings and vulnerabilities\n\nFirst, dependence on third-party intermediaries, many of which are still unregulated, has resulted in market failures and negative externalities, which crypto was initially designed to sidestep.\n\nThe crypto ecosystem, for instance, has cultivated its own concentration risks, with stablecoins assuming a key role in trading and liquidity provision within decentralised finance markets.[23] The difficulties faced by prominent stablecoins in the past year likely contributed significantly to the noticeable downturn in these markets.[24]\n\nIndeed, stablecoins often pose greater risks than initially thought. They introduce into the crypto space the kind of maturity mismatches commonly seen in money market mutual funds. As we have seen in the past year, redemption at par at all times is not guaranteed, risks of runs and contagion are omnipresent, and liquidation of reserve assets can lead to procyclical effects through collateral chains across the crypto ecosystem.\n\nAnother episode of instability driven by high concentration risk was the fall of the crypto exchange FTX. Initially the crisis seemed to primarily affect liquidity, but it quickly evolved into a solvency crisis. This situation arose due to FTX\u2019s inadequate risk management, unclear business boundaries and mishandling of customer funds. The repercussions of this event rippled through the crypto ecosystem, causing cascading liquidations[25] that underscored the interconnectedness and opacity of crypto markets. Ultimately, it showcased how swiftly confidence in the industry could deteriorate.\n\nSimilarities to the FTX case can be seen in the recent civil charges brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against the biggest remaining crypto exchange: Binance. These civil charges allege that Binance\u2019s CEO and Binance entities were involved in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure and calculated evasion of the law.[26] Should these allegations be proven, this would be yet another example of the fundamental shortcomings of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nThe recent crypto failures also show that risk, in itself, is technology-neutral. In financial services, it does not matter if a business ledger is kept on paper as it was for hundreds of years, in a centralised system as we have now or on a blockchain as in the crypto asset ecosystem. In the end, whether a firm remains in business or fails depends on how it manages credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and leverage. Crypto enthusiasts would do well to remember that new technology does not make financial risk disappear. The financial risk either remains or transforms into a different type. It is like pressing a balloon on one side: it will change in shape until it pops on the other side. And if the balloon is full of hot air, it may rise for a while but will burst in the end.\n\nLinks with the traditional financial sector\n\nThe second contradiction arises from the crypto industry\u2019s attempt to strengthen ties with actors in the financial system, including banks, big tech companies and the public sector.\n\nMajor payment networks[27] and intermediaries[28] have enhanced their support services for crypto-assets. Numerous prominent tech companies, including Meta (formerly Facebook) and Twitter, have explored ways to incorporate crypto into their platforms.[29] By leveraging their large customer base and offering a mix of payments and other financial services, tech firms, especially big techs, could solidify the ties between crypto-assets and the financial system.\n\nThe recent failures of Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank have highlighted the risks for banks associated with raising deposits from the crypto sector. The stability of these deposits is questionable given cryptos\u2019 volatility. The discontinuation of the Silvergate Exchange Network and SigNet, which functioned as a quasi-payment system for the crypto investments of Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank clients, also shows how crypto-assets service providers depend on the traditional financial sector for settlement in fiat money.\n\nThe crypto industry not only seeks to strengthen its ties with the traditional financial industry. It also seeks to gain access to the public safety net that strongly regulated financial entities benefit from.[30] Indeed, Circle, the issuer of the USD Coin (USDC) tried to gain access to the Federal Reserve's overnight reverse repurchasing facility in order to back its stablecoin.[31]\n\nThe crypto industry is seeking to grow by parasitising the financial system: it touts itself as an alternative to the financial sector, yet it seeks shelter within that very sector to address its inherent risks, all in the absence of adequate regulatory safeguards.\n\nThe public response: backing, regulating or innovating?\n\nThe public sector response can be encapsulated in three main suggestions.\n\nNot giving in to the temptation to offer public backing to cryptos\n\nFirst, the temptation to offer public backing to cryptos must be resisted.\n\nThe idea of permitting stablecoin issuers as non-bank financial institutions to hold their reserves at central banks might seem appealing, but could lead to serious adverse consequences.\n\nBy granting stablecoins access to the central bank\u2019s balance sheet, we would effectively outsource the provision of central bank money. If the stablecoin issuer were able to invest its reserve assets[32] in the form of risk-free deposits at the central bank, this would eliminate the investment risks that ultimately fall on the shoulders of stablecoin holders. And the stablecoin issuer could offer the stablecoin holders a means of payment that would be a close substitute for central bank money.[33]\n\nThis would compromise monetary sovereignty, financial stability and the smooth operation of the payment system. For example, a stablecoin could displace sovereign money by using the large customer network of a big tech, with far-reaching implications.[34] Therefore, central banks should exercise prudence and retain control over their balance sheet and the money supply.\n\nRegulating cryptos adequately and comprehensively\n\nSecond, regulators should refrain from implying that regulation can transform crypto-assets into safe assets. Efforts to legitimise unsound crypto models in a bid to attract crypto activities should be avoided.[35]\n\nMoreover, the principle of \"same activity, same risk, same regulation\" should be endorsed. Cryptos cannot become as safe as other assets and investors should be aware of the risks. Anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism rules should be enforced, and crypto activities of traditional firms should be carefully monitored.\n\nWhile some jurisdictions attempt to apply existing regulatory frameworks to crypto-assets, the EU\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation offers a customised regulatory structure that applies to all 27 EU Member States and draws on existing regulation where appropriate (e-money being one example). The EU has also updated existing regulation, for instance by extending the travel rule to crypto transactions.[36]\n\nDespite the EU taking the lead in establishing a comprehensive framework regulating crypto activities, further steps are necessary. All activities related to the crypto industry should be regulated, including decentralised finance activities like crypto-asset lending or non-custodial wallet services[37]. Moreover, the regulatory framework for unbacked crypto-assets may be deemed lighter than for stablecoins as it relies mainly on disclosure requirements for issuing white papers[38], and on the supervision of the service providers which will offer them for trading. The risks posed by unbacked crypto-assets, which are largely used for speculative purposes, should be fully recognised. Enhancing transparency and awareness of the risks associated with crypto-assets and their social cost are critical aspects of this approach. Public authorities will also need to address those social costs: for instance, cryptos\u2019 ecological footprint cannot be ignored in view of environmental challenges.\n\nAdditionally, the experience of FTX, which expanded massively with little oversight, underscores the importance of global crypto regulation and regulatory cooperation. The Financial Stability Board\u2019s recommendations[39] for the regulation and oversight of crypto-asset activities and markets need to be finalised and implemented urgently, also in non-FSB jurisdictions. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's standard on the prudential treatment of banks' crypto-asset exposures is a positive step in this direction. It stipulates conservative capital requirements for unbacked crypto-assets with a risk weight of 1,250%, as well as an exposure limit constraining the total amount of unbacked crypto a bank can hold to generally below 1% of Tier 1 capital. It will be key for the European Union and other Basel jurisdictions to transpose the Basel standard into their legislation by the 1 January 2025 deadline[40].\n\nHowever, regulation alone will not be sufficient.\n\nInnovating: digital settlement assets and central bank digital currencies\n\nThird, the public sector needs to contribute to the development of reliable digital settlement assets.\n\nCentral banks are innovating to provide a stability anchor that maintains trust in all forms of money in the digital age. Central bank money for retail use is currently only available in physical form \u2013 cash. But the digitisation of payments is diminishing the role of cash and its capacity to provide an effective monetary anchor. A central bank digital currency would offer a digital, risk-free standard and facilitate convertibility among different forms of private digital money. It would uphold the singleness of money and protect monetary sovereignty. We are advancing with our digital euro project and aim to complete our investigation phase later this year.\n\nFurthermore, the tokenisation of digital finance may require central banks to modify their technological infrastructure supporting the issuance of central bank money for wholesale transactions. This could involve establishing a bridge between market distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms and central bank infrastructures, or a new DLT-based wholesale settlement service with DLT-based central bank money.[41] We will involve the market in the exploratory work that we have recently announced.[42]\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, crypto-assets have been promoted as decentralised alternatives promising more resilient financial services. However, the reality does not live up to that promise. The blockchain technology underpinning crypto-assets can be extremely slow, energy-intensive and insufficiently scalable. The practicality of crypto-assets for everyday transactions is low due to their complex handling and significant price volatility.\n\nTo address these drawbacks, the crypto ecosystem has changed its narrative, favouring more centralised forms of organisation that emphasise crypto speculation and quick profit. But recent events have exposed the fragility of the crypto ecosystem, demonstrating how quickly confidence in crypto-assets can evaporate. In many respects, this ecosystem has recreated the very shortcomings and vulnerabilities that blockchain technology initially intended to address.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the crypto market seeks integration into the financial sector for increased relevance and public sector support. This would not provide the basis of a sustainable future for crypto. If anything, it would only heighten contradictions and vulnerabilities, resulting in greater instability and centralisation.\n\nThe public sector should adopt a determined position by establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework that addresses the social and environmental risks associated with crypto, including the use of unbacked crypto-assets for speculative purposes. It should also resist calls to provide state backing for cryptos, which would essentially socialise crypto risks. The public sector should instead focus its efforts on contributing to the development of reliable digital settlement assets, including through their work on central bank digital currencies.\n\nDecisive action of this kind should motivate the crypto ecosystem, including its foundational technology, the blockchain, to realign its objectives towards delivering real economic value within the digital finance landscape."

        "title": "BlackRock's Game-Changing Bitcoin ETF: What Every Investor Needs to Know - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Adding to the flurry of events in the crypto industry, BlackRock (BLK -0.43%), the world's largest asset manager, filed for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) last week.\n\nBlackRock's application sent shockwaves through the industry, amplified not only by its prominence in the global economy but also by the timing, coming just days after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against major players like Coinbase Global and Binance. Regardless of the timing, if BlackRock successfully enters the Bitcoin market, it has the potential to serve as a catalyst for a Bitcoin boon.\n\nBenefits of a spot ETF\n\nThe history of Bitcoin ETFs is lackluster. Today, there are no true Bitcoin ETFs on the market. Instead, there are a handful of trusts that try to track the token's price through future contracts.\n\nHistorically, these products have struggled to accurately track the price due to their reliance on speculative futures contracts, resulting in deviations. As a result, trusts often trade at a premium or discount since they lack the ability to directly purchase Bitcoin. For example, the prominent Bitcoin Trust from Grayscale currently trades at a 40% discount compared to the crypto's actual price.\n\nBut the proposed BlackRock Bitcoin ETF will remedy this problem, since it possesses characteristics more similar to a spot ETF, which unlike existing Bitcoin-based products on the market, will allow BlackRock to purchase or sell bitcoins at the end of each trading day to ensure that it accurately represents the true price of the token.\n\nA near-spotless record\n\nFor years, Grayscale and other notable firms like Fidelity, VanEck, and Ark Investment have submitted Bitcoin ETF applications, only to be consistently rejected by the SEC. Since the first application in 2013, numerous proposals have been turned down due to concerns over market manipulation, lack of regulation, and fraud risks in the Bitcoin market.\n\nBut the chances of approval for BlackRock's application appear extremely promising, given the firm's ability to get ETFs approved. With an impressive record of 575-1 in favor of approval, and a history of meeting market demand for its products, BlackRock has demonstrated a remarkable ability to navigate the regulatory landscape.\n\nNot only would BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF more closely resemble a true spot ETF, but it also looks to have hammered out solutions to the SEC's concerns over investor protection. The application states there will be added surveillance with the help of Nasdaq that will track customer identification and market trading data.\n\nBlackRock has also partnered with Coinbase to serve as the custodian of the actual bitcoins purchased, which will add greater levels of protection for investors.\n\nCrunching the numbers\n\nTo understand the magnitude of this approval's potential impact on Bitcoin's price, let's delve into the numbers. BlackRock has a massive portfolio totaling $9 trillion, bigger than the gross domestic product of most countries.\n\nAbout 11% of Bitcoin's current supply is sitting on exchanges representing roughly 2.2 million coins. Based on today's prices, that equates to around $66 billion worth of Bitcoin.\n\nFrom BlackRock's perspective, $66 billion is measly. Yet if just 0.7% of BlackRock's assets were allocated to Bitcoin, it would be enough to absorb all the coins currently available on exchanges.\n\nThis is a hypothetical scenario, of course, but it helps us truly grasp the immense significance and capital that could be eagerly waiting to flood into the Bitcoin market if the ETF is approved. The introduction of a more accurate Bitcoin ETF to the stock market has the potential to unleash a wave of adoption for the crypto like never before. There is plenty of evidence of institutional investors wanting to dive into Bitcoin, but the lack of suitable investment products has left their appetite unsatisfied.\n\nThe potential influx of institutional investors could create an unprecedented level of demand, propelling Bitcoin's price to new heights and reshaping the dynamics of the entire market. It could have a profound impact on the future of Bitcoin and the crypto industry as a whole."

        "content": "Bathhouse explained in an Instagram post on Wednesday that it is running mining rigs at its N 10th Street address in Brooklyn, which generate heat as a byproduct. The heat is taken by heat exchangers and used to heat the venue's pools, via a circulating system.\n\nA bathhouse in Brooklyn, New York, is heating its spa pools with waste heat from Bitcoin mining rigs - and sparked a social media controversy.\n\n\"Enjoy a hot pool while supporting the Bitcoin network,\" said Bathhouse's post. \"The pools absorb the heat and circulate cool liquid back to the miners. The process repeats forever.\"\n\nThe process is strikingly similar to Deep Green's campaign to heat swimming pools in the UK with heat generated by Edge data centers, which launched in March. However, Deep Green is offering its compute resources to AI and Machine Learning users via cloud workload aggregators. Bathhouse's support for Bitcoin mining has proven more controversial.\n\nSome readers complained that Bitcoin is inherently wasting energy, while others appeared to object to cryptocurrency on fashion grounds.\n\nNew York is increasingly hostile to cryptocurrencies. Following the failure of crypto exchange FTX, banks have backpedaled on moves to integrate cryptocurrencies into the financial systems, while the state passed a bill to ban crypto mining with fossil-derived electricity in June 2022.\n\nIn October 2022 a Federal report found that crypto mining uses 0.9 percent of the world's electricity, and as much energy as conventional data centers in the US.\n\nFans of the Bathhouse have pointed out that it would take exactly the same amount of electricity to heat the pools, whether or not the electricity also generated Bitcoin. In their view, the scheme is attacking the problem of Bitcoin's waste of energy.\n\n\"Someone needs to teach people an emergency thermodynamics class,\" commented Jalil Farid on Twitter, while others mocked the users for their lack of understanding.\n\n\"They want pure, unadulterated heat for their salt baths, not that dirty byproduct heat,\" said Phil Geiger.\n\nSome critics perhaps wanted the computing to be used for more valuable functions: \"I\u2019m concerned about who is mining this cryptocurrency, who is profiting from it, and whether I support that. We\u2019re gonna need some transparency,\u201d said one.\n\nBatthouse explains that it describes itself as a bathhouse, not a spa, because: \"Bathhouses offer functionality over fluff, while spas provide an experience that we like to call 'performative relaxation'.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin Surges Past $30,000 - 5 Reasons To Buy BTC Now - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Bitcoin Surges Past $30,000 \u2013 5 Reasons To Buy BTC Now\n\nAfter a 3-month downtrend, Bitcoin has roared back into life - surging past 30k. Against the backdrop of a worsening global economic crisis, are there still good reasons to buy Bitcoin? Is a new bull run just getting started?\n\nIs now a good time to buy Bitcoin? Over the last 18 months, Bitcoin and the wider crypto market have endured a torrid bear market that saw prices plummet following the collapse of industry stalwarts such as Celsius, BlockFi, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX.\n\nHowever, after dropping as low as $16,000 in November, BTC has staged an impressive recovery to begin 2023. With BTC up 83% year-to-date and blasting through $30,000, many technical analysts are now suggesting that the bottom is not only in, but a new uptrend is underway.\n\nFor new investors exploring Bitcoin for the first time, the landscape can be confusing, even intimidating. Perspectives on Bitcoin vary wildly from bullish zealots on the one hand to those who dismiss it as a worthless ponzi scheme on the other. If you\u2019re asking yourself \u2018should I buy Bitcoin now\u2019, here are five macro trends and data points to consider.\n\n1. The next Bitcoin Halving is Approaching\n\nThe Bitcoin halving, also known as the \"Bitcoin block reward halving,\" is a predetermined event that occurs approximately every four years in the Bitcoin network. It refers to the reduction in the rate at which new Bitcoins are created and awarded to miners for validating transactions and securing the network.\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving is approximately 300 days away. In trading markets, a lower supply with the same demand will lead to higher prices. Since the halving reduces the supply of new Bitcoins, and demand usually remains the same, the halving has preceded some of Bitcoin\u2019s largest bull runs.\n\nIn the Bitcoin protocol, there is a limited supply of 21 million Bitcoins that can ever exist. The issuance of new Bitcoins is programmed to gradually decrease over time. Initially, when Bitcoin was created in 2009, the block reward was set at 50 Bitcoins per block. However, as part of the network\u2019s design, this reward is cut in half roughly every 210,000 blocks, or about every four years.\n\nIn the 2024 halving, the reward will drop from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC.\n\nThe importance of the Bitcoin halving stems from its impact on the supply and inflation rate of Bitcoin. With each halving event, the rate at which new Bitcoins are produced is reduced by 50%. This reduction has significant implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem:\n\nScarcity: The halving is designed to gradually reduce the supply of new Bitcoins entering circulation, making Bitcoin increasingly scarce over time. This scarcity aspect is often cited as one of the reasons for Bitcoin\u2019s potential to store value and act as \"digital gold.\"\n\nInflation control: By reducing the rate of new coin issuance, the halving acts as a mechanism to control Bitcoin\u2019s inflation. As the supply growth slows down, it can potentially lead to increased demand, which may drive up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nMarket dynamics: The halving can have a profound impact on market dynamics, as it affects the incentives for miners. Miners, who validate transactions and maintain the network, receive newly minted Bitcoins as a reward. When the block reward is halved, miners receive fewer Bitcoins, which can influence their profitability and operational decisions. This can impact the overall network hashrate, mining difficulty, and potentially even the security of the network.\n\nMarket speculation: The anticipation and occurrence of the halving event often generates significant interest and speculation within the cryptocurrency community and beyond. Some believe that the reduction in the supply rate could lead to upward price pressure, as historical data has shown that previous halvings have been associated with bull markets.\n\nEvery Bitcoin halving has been followed by a new all time high.\n\n2. Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition is perfectly suited to the macro climate\n\nBitcoin was born out of the Global Financial Crisis of 2009. Against a backdrop of bank failures, government bailouts, and quantitative easing, Bitcoin was quietly deployed into the wild where it was ignored by everyone except for a small but growing group of idealists.\n\nA decade and a half later, and we are seeing a new financial crisis with more bailouts, more wobbly banks, and a monetary establishment trapped between interest rate hikes, runaway inflation, and the siren song of money printing.\n\nAs Brave New Coin founder Fran Strajnar explained in a recent editorial, \u201cthe current banking crisis is a result of the \u2018transitory\u2019 lie. The Fed should have reacted to inflation six months earlier, and raised rates more gradually. Instead, they slammed on the brakes and now we have a car crash.\u201d\n\nWith the Fed itself originally forecasting no major rate hikes as recently as 12 months ago, many banks parked huge sums in \"the world\u2019s safest asset\" \u2013 US Treasuries.\n\nThis of course turned into sharp pain on the balance sheets of various mid-sized banks in particular, as they purchased multi-year Treasuries thinking they were stable and predictable (and the Fed was shouting from the rooftops assuring no major rate hikes not long ago).\n\nFormer Chief Technology Officer of Coinbase, and former general partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Balaji Srinivasan goes further in stating the seriousness of the current banking crisis.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter, \u201cJust as in 2008, the bankers lied. This time, the central bankers, the banks, and the bank regulators have lied to all dollar holders and depositors. This isn\u2019t your typical fractional reserve situation. The problem is that there isn\u2019t enough in the banks on a mark-to-market basis to cover withdrawals.\u201d\n\nThey knew this throughout all of last year and communicated it internally in their coded language. The central banks, the banks, and the banking regulators all knew a huge crash was coming \u2014 the phrase is \"unrealized losses\". But they never notified you, the depositor.\n\nWith the Fed likely to continue to print money to ensure deposit liquidity can be met in the event of a bank-run crisis, Balaji says hyperinflation is a real possibility. The solution? Bitcoin of course.\n\n\u201cThis is the clearest way to see what\u2019s happening,\u201d writes Balaji. \u201cThey\u2019ve decided to monetize the debt in the messiest way possible by printing $150B+ for insolvent banks to cover an orgy of bank runs. The dollar supply is now going vertical and so is the demand for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto appears to have designed Bitcoin as a possible solution to this exact scenario. In 2009, shortly after the release of the Bitcoin white paper, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin posted to an internet forum.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that\u2019s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal says that as central banks again consider quantitative easing, the stage is set for hard assets such as Bitcoin and gold to perform well. \u201cHuge quantitative easing of fiat meets the hardest money that automatically quantitatively tightens. Bitcoin wins.\u201d\n\nThe contrast between central bank quantitative easing and an ever-expanding money supply against the quantitative tightening of Bitcoin\u2019s third halving is stark. Fiat currency supply is growing quickly, while the scarcity narrative of Bitcoin is growing in importance.\n\nMoney printing looks set to again find its way into asset prices, including gold and Bitcoin. A small reallocation of even 1% from other asset classes to Bitcoin would represent capital inflows greater than Bitcoin\u2019s current market cap.\n\n3. Bitcoin is still in the buy zone\n\nDave The Wave is a pseudo-anonymous investor, trader, and technical analyst. A contrarian, Dave has a unique insight into Bitcoin, its chart history, and its potential chart future.\n\nDave is the author of the Bitcoin Logarithmic Growth Curve chart, one of the few accurate predictive models of Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin is still in the buy zone (the shaded area on the charts below) of the LGC. Historically, buying Bitcoin in the \u2018buy zone\u2019 has proved profitable over the long term, and is certainly preferable to buying at the top of the channel when Bitcoin is overheated and in danger of crashing. Bitcoin has been in the buy zone (some might call it the accumulation zone) for almost 16 months now, and while Bitcoin is in the buy zone, the risk/reward for buyers/investors remains favorable. As Dave says \u201cbuy the dip, not the top\u201d.\n\nAs Dave\u2019s next chart below shows \u2013 when Bitcoin moves it can move quickly. While Bitcoin is still in the buy zone, a potential target for the next bull run is $150,000.\n\n4. On a long timeframe Bitcoin is the best performing asset on the planet\n\nOn a 3-year time horizon or more, Bitcoin is one of the best-performing assets on the planet as the chart below shows.\n\nSource: https://casebitcoin.com/charts\n\nBitcoin\u2019s strong performance has not escaped the notice of Wall Street analysts, investors and companies.\n\nIt\u2019s exactly this long term performance that reflects MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor\u2019s belief that \"Bitcoin, as the world\u2019s most widely-adopted cryptocurrency, is a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash. MicroStrategy has recognized Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset that can be superior to cash and accordingly has made Bitcoin the principal holding in its treasury reserve strategy.\"\n\nFollowing MicroStrategy\u2019s lead, in October 2020, payment platform Square announced that it had invested $50 million in Bitcoin, buying a total of 4,709 Bitcoins. Square said the investment represents about 1 percent of its total assets. Square said it was making the purchase because \u201cBitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future and an instrument of economic empowerment that provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system.\u201d\n\nJack Dorsey, the CEO of Square is a long-time Bitcoin evangelist and investor. Square has previously invested in bitcoin from a product, leadership, and legal innovation perspective, and today adds this financial investment. The company launched bitcoin trading in 2018 with Cash App, which enables the buying and selling of bitcoin. In 2019, the company formed Square Crypto, an independent team solely focused on contributing to bitcoin open-source work for the benefit of all, and also recently launched the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a non-profit organization encouraging crypto innovation and opening access to patented crypto inventions.\n\nWhile the 2022 bear market crash and crypto company blow-up has deterred any other public companies from following MicroStrategy and Square\u2019s lead, that might be about to change.\n\nBack in 2021 Jack Dorsey tweeted that hyperinflation is coming.\n\nAs reported above, Balaji Srinivasan is now making the case that hyperinflation is imminent. The Fed is devaluing the dollar. This is what Ray Dalio predicted: the monetization of the debt.\n\nIf this trend continues, and any bank runs begin, that could turn into a positive feedback loop for Bitcoin. First individuals will rush to protect their wealth by buying Bitcoin, then companies, the institutions, and then small nation states. Will this scenario actually happen this year? It seems far-fetched, but the one lesson we can learn from history is that when hyperinflation happens, it happens fast.\n\nIn 1923, at the worst time of German hyperinflation, the exchange rate between the dollar and the Mark was one trillion Marks to one dollar, and a wheelbarrow full of money would not even buy a newspaper. Most Germans were taken completely by surprise by the speed of the financial tornado. In today\u2019s digital world, it\u2019s likely that hyperinflation happens even faster.\n\nSource: Twitter\n\n5. A Bitcoin Spot ETF may finally be approved\n\nFor ten years, countless crypto exchanges, startups and institutions have tried and failed to win SEC approval for a U.S. Bitcoin Spot ETF.\n\nThe launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF would be a significant step in the legitimization of the crypto asset industry. It would open the door to an eventual pathway for the wider American investment community to invest in Bitcoin. It would mean investors don\u2019t have to custody Bitcoin themselves and should attract significant new inflows.\n\nThis month, asset giant BlackRock, which manages $9.5 trillion in assets, surprised the crypto world when it applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Though the product is technically a trust, it is the same as a spot ETF, analysts say.\n\nIt is thought that Blackrock\u2019s (BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust application has a better chance of approval by the SEC than all other applications to date. That\u2019s because of a \u201csurveillance-sharing agreement\u201d between exchanges.\n\nOn page 36 of the 19b-4 filing, it says that to avoid market manipulation, the Nasdaq will enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with an operator of a spot trading platform for Bitcoin.\n\nThis could finally satisfy the SEC, that the ETF can function without market manipulation, a charge it has used to deny previous Bitcoin Spot ETF proposals.\n\nIs BlackRock going to succeed where all others have failed? The current regulatory environment remains uncertain but the Wall Street giant has the best shot yet.\n\nWe\u2019ll know early next year, about one month before the halving. If they succeed, expect Bitcoin fireworks.\n\nThe application can be read here.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the below chart from Rekt Capital indicates, the downward resistance trendline from the most recent all time high has been broken. This suggests that we are at the very beginning of a new uptrend that will eventually blossom into a full blown bull market.\n\nHistorical price data suggests that Bitcoin will eventually exceed its most recent all-time high of $69,000. Whether or not it happens this year, or next year, the risk-reward continues to favor those investors who buy when Bitcoin is in the lower part of the LGC channel and hold for the long term.\n\nBitcoin appears to be an asymmetric bet. If one only invests what one can afford to lose, there is a limited risk of loss with the benefit of substantial upside. Based on Bitcoin\u2019s network effects, growing adoption, the supply shock following next year\u2019s halving, and the volatile macro backdrop, Bitcoin appears set to outperform in the years ahead. How long will you stay on the sidelines?"

        "content": "Those scanning through the latest pile of proposed spot bitcoin ETF filings have likely seen a term come up again and again: surveillance-sharing agreement.\n\nMentions are plastered all over the proposal by asset management giant BlackRock, as well more recent filers, such as Valkyrie, Bitwise, WisdomTree and Invesco.\n\nWhen considering proposed bitcoin ETFs, the SEC weighs whether the intended listing exchange \u2014 Nasdaq, NYSE or another entity \u2014 can meet certain obligations under the Exchange Act to prevent fraud and manipulation.\n\nThe exchange can do this by demonstrating it has \u201ca comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to the underlying or reference bitcoin assets,\u201d according to a June 2022 SEC order rejecting Bitwise\u2019s bid for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe size of such a market is not quantified numerically.\n\nThe metric rather refers to a market in which there is \u201ca reasonable likelihood\u201d a would-be manipulator would have to trade on that market to do so \u2014 \u201cso that a surveillance-sharing agreement would assist in detecting and deterring misconduct,\u201d the document states.\n\nA market of significant size would also be one in which trading in the ETP would not be the predominant influence on pricing.\n\nSurveillance-sharing agreements are not the only way exchanges seeking to list a bitcoin ETF can meet Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, the SEC notes in the Bitwise order.\n\nBut, the securities regulator says, \u201csuch agreements have previously provided the basis for the exchanges that list commodity-trust ETPs to meet those obligations, and the commission has historically recognized their importance.\u201d\n\nThey allow for information sharing about market trading activity, clearing activity and customer identity, the SEC has said.\n\nDavid Hirsch, chief of the crypto asset and cyber unit within the SEC\u2019s division of enforcement, said last week prospective spot bitcoin ETF issuers have not established there is \u201can adequate system of surveillance\u201d comparable to trading on a registered exchange.\n\nEnter BlackRock, a fund giant with roughly $9 trillion assets under management \u2014 which last week, for the first time, filed for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nRead more: Is BlackRock\u2019s clout enough to get its spot bitcoin ETF past the SEC?\n\nThe June 15 filing by Nasdaq, the exchange on which its ETF would be listed, points out the SEC\u2019s approval of ETFs that hold bitcoin futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\n\u201cIf CME\u2019s surveillance is sufficient to mitigate concerns related to trading in bitcoin futures for which the pricing is based directly on pricing from spot bitcoin markets, it\u2019s not clear how such a conclusion could apply only to ETPs based on bitcoin futures and not extend to spot bitcoin ETPs,\u201d it states.\n\nNasdaq expects to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with \u201can operator of a US-based spot trading platform for bitcoin,\u201d which is not named in the filing.\n\nSumit Roy, a senior analyst at ETF.com, told Blockworks earlier this week that the additional agreement might not be enough for approval, particularly if the platform operator is Coinbase \u2014 a company the SEC sued earlier this month.\n\n\u201cBut because BlackRock is involved, there is hope that they have the inside scoop and will get this done,\u201d Roy said.\n\nProposals feature different exchanges\n\nInvestment firm Valkyrie on Wednesday became the latest to re-join the spot bitcoin ETF race.\n\nThe company\u2019s last attempt to launch a spot bitcoin ETF ended in December 2021 when the SEC failed to give it the go-ahead.\n\nThe Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund, according to the new filing, would trade under the ticker BRRR \u2014 seemingly a reference to the sound of a money printer.\n\nThe firm, like BlackRock, named Nasdaq as its listing exchange, which Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said in a tweet could give it an edge over others.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nValkyrie\u2019s new bid followed a filing by Bitwise, as well as those by more traditional finance players WisdomTree and Invesco. It was not their first attempt.\n\nBitwise\u2019s proposed spot bitcoin ETF would be listed on NYSE Arca, while the planned products by WisdomTree and Invesco would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nA prospective spot bitcoin ETF by Ark Invest and 21Shares, re-filed for in April, would also trade on Cboe.\n\n\u201cIt depends on when [and] if the SEC approves the 19b-4 applications for the other exchanges,\u201d Seyffart told Blockworks in an email. \u201cIf there are multiple days between approval of Nasdaq\u2019s application and NYSE/Cboe, then that would be a theoretical window for Valkyrie to slip their fund in before the [others].\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "What happened\n\nCryptocurrencies and crypto stocks continued their ascent higher today as institutional interest in the space has sparked a major rally.\n\nSince late afternoon yesterday, the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC 1.03%), traded roughly 3% higher as of 2:07 p.m. ET today and had surpassed $31,100 as of this writing.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH -1.27%) had exploded by close to 29%, while the price of the Bitcoin-mining company Bit Digital (BTBT 0.45%) was up roughly 4.4% on the day after having been up by close to 12% at one point earlier.\n\nSo what\n\nEver since BlackRock (BLK -0.43%) filed to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the sector has rallied, and that excitement did not lose steam today, largely as analysts continued to point to what a catalyst it could be if BlackRock receives approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn a recent research note, JPMorgan Chase analysts wrote:\n\nShould BlackRock or other firms be successful in this endeavor for a spot Bitcoin ETF, this may incite competition for spot-Bitcoin ETFs, incentivize firms to create other spot-crypto ETFs, and/or pave the way for other crypto productions that incorporate traditional financial instruments.\n\nBitcoin Cash also continued its impressive run, which was sparked by news earlier this week that the crypto exchange EDX Markets had gone live and is offering Bitcoin Cash as one of the cryptocurrencies on the platform. EDX is backed by Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Citadel, showing another foray into the digital asset space by mainstream financial giants.\n\nIn other news today, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the large U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN -1.72%) in what is apparently the court's first big crypto ruling. The case involved a Coinbase user suing the company after money in his account was allegedly stolen.\n\nThe matter had sparked a class action lawsuit that was proceeding until the Supreme Court put the case on pause, as Coinbase seeks to take the matter to arbitration. The Supreme Court also dismissed another case in which users claimed that Coinbase breached false advertising laws in California by advertising a contest that allowed users to win prizes in the form of the meme token Dogecoin.\n\nWhile the cases may not have huge ramifications for the industry, they could hint at a pro-crypto tilt for the court, which could be helpful down the line.\n\nIn an article published today by Forbes, Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal told the publication, \"We're prepared to rely upon the courts because we think it's critical to the future of our industry.\" Coinbase and Binance were recently sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nNow what\n\nThe crypto industry still seems to be benefiting from all of the good news about traditional financial giants diving further into the space, which I think is giving investors confidence because the moves, if successful, would likely broaden exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The Supreme Court's decision is also likely to give investors confidence about battles that are likely coming down the road.\n\nI think Bitcoin is worth having exposure to and will end up appreciating on more of a long-term basis. But I'm not really that bullish on Bitcoin Cash or Bit Digital. I own a little Bitcoin Cash but purchased it a while ago and prefer the largest cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin right now.\n\nThe Bitcoin miners benefit when Bitcoin does well but are ultimately more volatile in an already volatile industry."

PYMNTS noted at the time that the project showed the firms\u2019 faith in the crypto market and could offer a boost to the industry.\n\nAnother project that Bloomberg cited as a contributor to bitcoin\u2019s recent rise, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s euro-denominated transactions with its blockchain-based JPM Coin, went live Wednesday (June 21).\n\nThe benefits of this offering include payments that operate around the clock, payments that are executed more quickly than traditional transactions, and the ability to initiate payments that are not yet due, Bloomberg reported Friday."

        "content": "Bitcoin traded above US$30,000 in Thursday morning trading in Asia, leading gains across all top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The rally follows news of more major financial institutions venturing into crypto after BlackRock announced a Bitcoin ETF application last week. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony on Wednesday that Bitcoin has \u201cstaying power.\u201d\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin surged 6.72% over the last 24 hours to US$30,118.51 at 7:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, up 20.33% for the past week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency broke through the US$30,000 resistance line early morning on Thursday for the first time since April.\n\nEther also rose 6.04% to US$1,893, gaining 14.79% for the week.\n\n\u201cMarket confidence has recently been buoyed by BlackRock\u2019s BTC ETF application as they\u2019ve successfully attained 575 ETF applications with only one denial, while Fidelity is rumored to be following right behind with a BTC ETF application too,\u201d said Nick Ruck, the chief operating officer of blockchain venture studio ContentFi Labs, in an emailed statement.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with US$8.59 trillion under management as of the end of 2022, filed an application on June 15 for the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Other leading financial institutions followed, despite U.S. regulators this month filing lawsuits against crypto exchanges, alleging they illegally trade many tokens that should have been registered as financial securities.\n\nIn a related bullish development, EDX Markets, the New Jersey-based digital asset exchange backed by Wall Street firms, such as Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab Corp., opened for business in the U.S. on Tuesday. The exchange offers Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin tokens for trading.\n\nDeutch Bank AG, Germany\u2019s largest bank, has also applied to a local regulator for a license to operate as a crypto custodian, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cJerome Powell also made some remarks about Bitcoin that could be interpreted as bullish,\u201d Benjamin Stani, the director of business development and sales at crypto trading platform Matrixport, told Forkast via Telegram message.\n\nPowell reportedly said during a monetary policy hearing at Capitol Hill on Wednesday that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have \u201cstaying power\u201d as an asset class, and that the central bank regards stablecoins used for payments as a form of money. He also said that the central bank should have a stronger role in regulating stablecoins.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies gained in the past 24 hours. Cardano\u2019s ADA jumped 7.02% to US$0.287 for a weekly increase of 9.61%, helped by news of network improvements. Litecoin rose 6.56% to US$85.28, up 16.87% in the past seven days.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token jumped 5.10% to US$0.5217 Thursday morning after San Francisco-based Ripple Labs said it received in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore to offer digital payment services in the city-state.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market capitalization rose 4.96% to US$1.17 trillion in the last 24 hours, while trading volume surged 59.05% to US$60.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT little changed\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.43% to 2,910.36 in the 24 hours to 8:45 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 0.50% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT transactions rose 1.15% to US$53.4 million, while transactions on Ethereum rose 81% to US$15.3 million.\n\n\u201cOverall kind of a boring day in NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cThere is some excitement about all of the news in crypto, but that\u2019s not impacting NFTs yet, other than helping us stay even instead of maintaining that decline we were in.\u201d\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT transactions surged 95.51% to US$1.9 million. Transactions in Mutant Ape Yacht Club, another collection from Yuga Labs, grew 44.93% to exceed US$1 million. Yuga Labs said Wednesday it is launching a new game on June 29 based on its Bored Ape-related HV-MTL NFT collection.\n\nU.S. futures dip following Powell speech\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell | Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 11:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures and the S&P 500 futures both inched down 0.11%, while Nasdaq futures dipped 0.19%.\n\nThe three major U.S. stock indexes closed lower on Wednesday after Fed chair Powell told a U.S. Congress committee that interest rate will need to go higher to tame inflation, which is now at around 4.05% or on a declining trend, but still more than double the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\n\nWhile the Fed left rates unchanged at its meeting on June 14, it does project rates to reach 5.6% in 2023, indicating two more rate hikes within the year.\n\n\u201cInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent,\u201d Powell said. \u201cNearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nPowell is scheduled to speak again on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 28.1% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in July, and a 71.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, down from 76.9% on Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) will hit new all-time highs in 2023, and October is the favorite month for it, a popular trader says.\n\nIn a Twitter update on June 22, Credible Crypto argued that the next four months should deliver the bullish BTC price momentum needed to tackle $69,000.\n\nOctober \u201cfairly logical\u201d for new Bitcoin all-time highs\n\nBitcoin has put in a solid performance this month, and Credible Crypto is increasingly optimistic for continuation. To do so, BTC/USD needs to present increasingly larger green monthly candles to keep it in line with previous impulse periods.\n\n\u201cWhats clear with any parabolic advance is that momentum increases exponentially and peaks at the top. We can see this in both prior impulsive moves from 3k-14k and from 10k-60k,\u201d he explained.\n\nThis time around, Bitcoin has delivered a successful retest of support on monthly timeframes, with $25,000 now possibly a springboard for a new \u201cparabolic advance.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo with that in mind, let\u2019s take our current situation- monthly retest complete and the largest monthly candle we have seen thus far was a 10k move which broke us above the monthly level of 25k,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cThis means I would expect that once expansion begins (which it looks like it has) we should see monthly moves of > 10k at a time, easily. From current levels to prior ATH is a $40,000 gap. This gap should then, logically, be covered within a few monthly candles if this is a parabolic advance.\u201d\n\nTiming for such a move remains open, Credible Crypto added, while suggesting October as a \u201cfairly logical guesstimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith that being said, that\u2019s all this is- an estimation based on the logic presented above,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u201cI am not saying we MUST hit new all time highs by October, I AM saying I do think we will hit new ATH by the end of this year and if someone forced me to pick a month in which I think this will occur it would be October. Let\u2019s see how things play out.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Credible Crypto/Twitter\n\nToo early to celebrate?\n\nAs Cointelegraph continues to report, other traders are also keen for a return to record BTC price levels.\n\nRelated: 3 Bitcoin price metrics showing \u2018insane\u2019 similarities to 2020 breakout\n\nAt the same time, not everyone believes that the impetus for recent gains showcased by applications from BlackRock and others to launch Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States will get the green light.\n\nThe current make-up of U.S. regulatory oversight means that \u201cnear-term\u201d approvals, even for BlackRock, remain less than likely, trading firm QCP Capital warned this week.\n\nBTC/USD traded around the $30,000 mark at the time of writing, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, having cooled upside volatility the day prior.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour chart.

On Thursday, TrueUSD said it has no exposure to Prime Trust and that the firm maintains multiple USD rails for minting and redemption.\n\nFollowing the news, Bitcoin fell to a daily low of US$29,689 around 11:55 p.m. on Thursday but recovered above US$30,000 as investors remained upbeat following one of this year\u2019s most eventful weeks that saw notable TradFi alumni entering the crypto space.\n\nThe institutional adoption wave started last week, when the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, which if accepted, would be the first publicly-traded Bitcoin product on the U.S. market. Earlier this week, Germany\u2019s largest bank Deutsche Bank also applied for a license to operate a crypto custody service, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe turbulences of 2022 have led to a decline in confidence in crypto-native institutions, presenting traditional financial institutions with a prime opportunity to enter the crypto market,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast in a LinkedIn response.\n\n\u201cInitiatives like Deutsche Bank applying for a digital asset custody license should improve investor sentiment\u2026 All in all, regulation and institutional players will lead to an influx of fiat money into the crypto sector in the long run, driving prices up.\u201d\n\nEDX Markets, a crypto exchange backed by major Wall Street players like Citadel Securities, Fidelity and Charles Schwab, officially launched on Tuesday in the U.S., despite the recent regulatory crackdown on crypto.\n\nNew York-based asset management firm WisdomTree also filed an application for a Bitcoin ETF on Tuesday, a day before Valkyrie Investments filed its own spot Bitcoin ETF application. Rumors are circulating that Fidelity is also preparing its own application.\n\nJames Wo, the founder and chief executive officer of crypto investment firm DFG, said that BlackRock\u2019s move means \u201cold money\u201d from traditional finance is entering the crypto space.\n\n\u201cIf the application can be approved, it shows that the SEC is not just cracking down on cryptocurrencies, but SEC regulation will help further the maturity of the industry, and more products similar to ETF will emerge, which is a great benefit for the industry.\u201c wrote Wo, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, said that there are more rumors circulating about Fidelis preparing its own spot Bitcoin ETF application.\n\n\u201cThis move could be indicative of institutional players joining the crypto market and may signal an uptick in institutional interest. The potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF has been highly anticipated by many industry experts as it could bring more mainstream adoption to cryptocurrency,\u201d wrote Stadelmann, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.17 trillion on Friday at 7:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 12.5% from US$1.04 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$583 billion, Bitcoin represented 49.9% of the market while Ether, valued at US$225 billion, accounted for 19.3%.\n\nNotable Movers: PEPE & STX\n\nPepe, the year\u2019s most trending memecoin, was this week\u2019s biggest loser in the top 100. Pepe started gaining momentum on Wednesday, rallying 64.49% to US$0.000001537, as risk appetite returned.\n\nSTX, the native token of Bitcoin smart contract layer Stacks, was the week\u2019s second-biggest gainer. The token started picking up on Tuesday, boosted by Bitcoin\u2019s bullish momentum paired with the recent spot Bitcoin ETF applications by the likes of BlackRock.\n\nSee related article: Why the US is waging war on Binance, Coinbase\n\nNext week: More Bitcoin ETF applications on the way?\n\nKomodo\u2019s Stadelmann said that institutional interest in crypto is heating up due to developing regulations and increasing customer demand.\n\n\u201cMajor financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have also expressed interest in offering crypto-related products to their clients. Moreover, the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price has further piqued the interest of institutional investors who are seeking exposure to this emerging asset class,\u201d wrote Stadelmann.\n\nJamie Coutts, a senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said that Bitcoin is in an early bull market and expects the cycle to last until November 2025.\n\n\u201cBitcoin will likely absorb more of the global economic base while subsuming value from traditional banking and payment providers,\u201d wrote Coutts.\n\nNext week, investors will be anticipating speeches from key Federal Reserve officials, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, for cues on the health of the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nEuropean investors will be looking to European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde\u2019s speech, for hints on the block\u2019s future monetary policy decisions.\n\nSee related article: Crypto firms eye Hong Kong amid tough US regulations, says fintech association chair"

        "title": "Bitcoin and correlations \u2014 Examining the relationship between BTC, gold and the Nasdaq - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Some news sources have been fond of comparing Bitcoin (BTC) price action and other assets. In particular, the two most commonly compared asset classes are gold and tech stocks.\n\nWhile a correlation holds, it tends to be a big news story. Throughout much of 2022 and early 2023, for example, the \u201cBitcoin trades in tandem with tech stocks\u201d narrative was prevalent. Since that correlation has broken down, however, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much related news coverage.\n\nNow a new narrative has taken the spotlight: Bitcoin\u2019s correlation to gold. Ever since the failures of Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank in March, both assets have rallied. Both narratives make sense on the surface. If Bitcoin is to be seen as a speculative asset, then it might trade similarly to a tech stock. And if Bitcoin is more of a safe-haven asset, a correlation to gold seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that correlations can come and go. Just because two assets share a correlation for a time doesn\u2019t always mean they share a place in the market long-term. And when zooming out to larger timeframes, it might be possible to rule out correlations.\n\nLet\u2019s examine both of these correlations on a one-year basis and see if they have any merit.\n\nBitcoin, gold and NASDAQ: one-year correlation analysis\n\nYear-to-date, Bitcoin has gained roughly 58%, rising from $16,600 at the start of the year to over $26,000 at the time of writing. In the same timeframe, the Nasdaq has gained about 36%, rising from 11,000 to just shy of over 15,000.\n\nMeanwhile, gold has risen by just over 7% year-to-date.\n\nYear-to-date chart of BTC/USD, Nasdaq and gold with 90-day correlation coefficient. Source: TradingView\n\nAccording to the 90-day correlation coefficient, BTC is presently positively correlated to gold (0.58) and negatively correlated to tech stocks (-0.65). For most of this year, BTC has been highly correlated to both assets. At the beginning of the year, the correlation to gold was deeply negative, while the correlation to tech stocks was just below neutral.\n\nSo then, which is it? Safe-haven correlation or risk asset correlation? Or does the presence of multiple correlations point to no correlation at all? Does similar price action on a yearly basis constitute a significant relationship between two assets in the first place?\n\nSuch a discussion could get quite lengthy. These questions are best interpreted on a rhetorical basis, i.e., they imply that there could be any number of assets that share similar patterns of price action on a one-year chart.\n\nWhen looking at the question in terms of percentage gains, things look more different still: gold is up 9%, while Bitcoin is up 18% and the Nasdaq is up 30%.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning the significance of the fact that Bitcoin tends to be correlated with equities for a time now and then. But so far this year, the relationship between the two remained constant throughout the banking crisis that began in March and led to an extensive rally for BTC. Since then, the relationship has disappeared; the Nasdaq has rallied to year-to-date highs, with BTC mostly trading sideways.\n\nOn a long enough timeline, everything breaks down\n\nOver the past 14 years, Bitcoin has risen against the U.S. dollar by tens of millions of percentage points. Few asset classes can boast similar returns. Other assets don\u2019t carry the same degree of volatility either, making a long-standing correlation even less likely.\n\nAll-time BTC/USD chart. Source: TradingView\n\nTo date, gold has risen from $800 in early 2009 to $1,945 today \u2014 a gain of almost 150%.\n\nAll time gold/USD chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe Nasdaq is up more than 10x since early 2009, with returns in excess of 1,000%. While these are not insignificant gains, they are a far cry from the 52,000,000% that Bitcoin returned from July 2010 to the present.\n\nAll-time chart of Nasdaq. Source: TradingView\n\nIn summary, the key takeaways here are:\n\nAn asset that rises by more than 50,000,000% over the course of its lifetime might not be correlated to much else.\n\nThe correlations between Bitcoin, gold and tech stocks often can\u2019t be seen on timeframes in excess of a year or two.\n\nDue in large part to the previous two points, the correlations don\u2019t hold much significance.\n\nInvestors would do well to keep this in mind when interpreting markets. Banking on any specific correlation as part of a strategy could be risky, as that correlation could break at any moment.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin DeFi: A Brief Introduction - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) built on Ethereum and other networks has grown tremendously over the years. However, a new, growing DeFi market has emerged on Bitcoin, powered by numerous second-layer solutions and the recent Taproot update, which has opened the door for more use cases on Bitcoin.\n\nRead on to learn more about Bitcoin DeFi, how it is made possible on Bitcoin, and what Bitcoin DeFi applications already exist.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin DeFi?\n\nTo understand Bitcoin DeFi, we first need to understand what DeFi is.\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) is a peer-to-peer financial system that eliminates (financial) intermediaries, allowing you to utilize Internet-native financial products and services powered by smart contracts from anywhere in the world. All you need is Internet connectivity and a crypto wallet.\n\nBitcoin DeFi refers to decentralized finance applications and protocols built on Bitcoin, whether on-chain or on second-layer solutions.\n\nWhy Are More DeFi Protocols Being Built on Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is the largest and most secure cryptocurrency network in the world. Moreover, it\u2019s also the most decentralized, providing the ideal infrastructure for decentralized finance that is highly decentralized.\n\nThe downtimes of popular DeFi chains like Solana and even Ethereum highlight the need for DeFi to be built on a robust foundation to fulfill its full potential of providing crypto-native financial services to the world.\n\nThat\u2019s where Bitcoin could come in.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin DeFi enables the digital currency bitcoin to become a productive asset, allowing BTC holders to earn a yield on their holdings in a decentralized, permissionless manner. Given the large number of BTC holders, there is ample demand for income-generating protocols that allow Bitcoiners to earn a yield on the asset they are HODLing.\n\nHow Is DeFi Made Possible on Bitcoin?\n\nDeFi on Bitcoin is primarily enabled by layer-2 solutions that provide smart contract functionalities to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Listed below are some current solutions set to unlock Bitcoin\u2019s true potential.\n\nLiquid Network\n\nLiquid Network\n\nis a layer-2 sidechain that brings asset issuance to Bitcoin and improves security and scalability on the network. Liquid Network operates on top of Bitcoin but doesn\u2019t alter its base layer, acting independently with its own ledger and consensus mechanism. It increases transaction settlement speed and confidentiality.\n\nMintlayer\n\nMintlayer\n\nis a layer-2 solution built on the Bitcoin network that brings tokenization and value transfer without compromising security. It unlocks opportunities for Bitcoin users to access all types of DeFi applications with real-life value without wrapped tokes or token bridges.\n\nRootstock\n\nRootstock (RSK) is a sidechain that adds smart contract functionality to Bitcoin through the use of a two-way peg, enabling BTC to be turned into rBTC and used in a range of DeFi applications built on RSK.\n\nStacks\n\nStacks\n\nis a layer-2 smart contract platform that enhances the functionality of Bitcoin through contracts and decentralized applications. Stacks may add new functionalities to Bitcoin without compromising security.\n\nTaproot Assets\n\nTaproot Assets\n\nis a layer-3 protocol allowing users to issue fungible and non-fungible digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain, which can also be transferred over to the Lightning Network. Taproot Assets leverages the recent Taproot upgrade to enable asset issuance on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nExamples of Bitcoin DeFi Applications\n\nLet\u2019s now take a look at two examples of Bitcoin DeFi applications.\n\nALEX on Stacks\n\nALEX\n\nis the leading full-service Bitcoin DeFi platform on Stacks that allows users to trade, lend and borrow digital assets with Stacks as the smart contract layer and Bitcoin as the settlement layer. The idea behind ALEX is to provide permissionless and decentralized financial services for the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nSovryn on Rootstock\n\nSovryn\n\nis the first non-custodial smart contract application on Rootstock for lending, borrowing, and margin trading with Bitcoin. The protocol provides a range of DeFi services that enable BTC holders to earn yield on their assets, making it a popular destination for Bitcoiners who want to earn yield on their holdings.\n\nBitcoin DeFi continues to grow with more and more layer-2 solutions emerging for Bitcoin to bring more use cases and functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nWhile the DeFi market on Bitcoin is still small compared to that of Ethereum and BNB Chain, the recent innovations on Bitcoin, including Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, could attract more crypto users from other chains (back) to Bitcoin to explore the latest possibilities in the Bitcoin sphere."

        "content": "A bathhouse in Brooklyn, New York, has left users on Instagram and Twitter divided after it revealed that it is using Bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs to heat its spa.\n\nIn a June 21 Instagram post, Bathhouse explained it is running Bitcoin mining rigs at its location in Brooklyn, which generates heat as a byproduct. In the post, it described in three steps how the heat is taken by heat exchangers and used to heat the venue\u2019s pools via a circulating system.\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of creating valid blocks that add transaction records to Bitcoin\u2019s public ledger, which is called a blockchain. Bitcoin mining consumes a significant amount of energy, often sourced from fossil fuels. This contributes to carbon emissions and raised concerns about its environmental footprint.\n\nIn January 2022, a report estimated that the Bitcoin mining network emits 42 megatons of carbon dioxide, accounting for 0.08% of the world\u2019s total production.\n\nInstagram users who follow the Bathhouse account weren\u2019t all sold on the idea. One user who identifies as Annalarranaga posted, \u201cThis makes me like Bathhouse less. Now I\u2019m concerned about who is mining this cryptocurrency, who is profiting from it, and whether I support that. We\u2019re gonna need some transparency.\u201d\n\nScreenshot of comments on Bathhouse\u2019s Instagram post. Source: Instagram\n\nAnother user further claimed that Bathhouse customers \u201cwant pure, unadulterated heat for their salt baths, not that dirty byproduct heat.\u201d On the other hand, some reveled in the disdain users had for the mining-heated pools, while at least one seemed happy with them, saying, \u201cI for one think this is a great way to heat the pools and will check this place out because of this.\u201d\n\nScreenshot of comments about Bathhouse\u2019s bitcoin-mining pool heating.

        "title": "'Bitcoin-only' buy-and-hold investing outperforms altcoins over long term, analysis shows - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Altcoins offer diverse, innovative features, promising technological advancements and potentially lucrative investment opportunities.\n\nVarious altcoins can post handsome gains that surpass those of Bitcoin (BTC), particularly during times of increased popularity, known as altcoin seasons. However, analysis from K33 Research shows that over the long term, a \u201cBitcoin-only\u201d investment strategy has been more profitable than an altcoin portfolio.\n\nAltcoin portfolio underperformed Bitcoin over the long run\n\nBitcoin has had three consecutive bull and bear market cycles since 2013, with the latest coming in 2021. In each cycle, Bitcoin\u2019s price rose parabolically in a concise span, usually a few months, after surpassing the peak of its previous cycle.\n\nIn 2013, BTC peaked at around $1,175, followed by a downtrend for two years. At the time, the altcoin market was in its nascent stage. The fiat on-ramps to Bitcoin were limited, and exchanges on which investors could convert to altcoins were rare.\n\nHowever, by the end of 2015, a number of altcoins had arrived, including the launch of Ethereum and its native Ether (ETH) coin. A few exchanges had also been formed that supported the conversion of Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies, paving the way for an altcoin market.\n\nIt was not until April 2017, when Bitcoin\u2019s price broke above its 2013 top, that a bullish run occurred among altcoins. During the second half of 2017, the initial coin offering boom on Ethereum and retail investment hype around Ripple\u2019s XRP (XRP) led to an altcoin season, with many tokens outperforming Bitcoin until January 2018.\n\nNevertheless, in the aftermath of the bull market, altcoins generally suffered greater losses than Bitcoin, suggesting the surge resulted from users buying them during Bitcoin bull markets with the hope of capturing higher returns.\n\nThe chart below shows that Bitcoin found support around $6,500 during the bear market of 2018 to 2019 after recovering from lows of $3,250 in late 2018. However, the total market capitalization of altcoins continued to hover around its lows for most of the duration of the bear market, only reversing the trend after Bitcoin broke above its previous peak of $20,000.\n\nBitcoin price (top) and altcoin market capitalization (bottom). Source: TradingView\n\nK33 Research calculated the performance of investing $1 each in 1,009 altcoins since 2015 as they entered the top 100 by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap versus the same amount invested in Bitcoin simultaneously.\n\nThe altcoin portfolio would be worth approximately $7,000 today, compared with $50,000 from the Bitcoin-only strategy.\n\nAltcoins vs. Bitcoin performance since 2015. Source: K33 Research\n\nAltcoins are usually narrative-driven, and many narratives die with the evolution of the market. For instance, privacy-based tokens were quite popular in 2017, but many have dropped out of the top 100 due to regulatory scrutiny.\n\nSimilarly, many of the decentralized finance tokens that populated the market in 2020 \u2014 such as Compound\u2019s COMP (COMP) and THORChain's RUNE (RUNE) \u2014 have dropped out of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap due to declining DeFi usage and demand for holding non-yielding governance tokens.\n\nAltcoins are also subject to volatility and unpredictable shifts, with regulatory uncertainty hovering over most. They may experience their individual altcoin seasons at different times, and the duration can vary significantly, requiring investors to have perfect timing to churn a profit.\n\nK33\u2019s analysts found that since 2015, over two-thirds of the 1,009 altcoin projects that managed to creep into the top 100 have become inactive. Only 9.11% of these altcoins yielded positive returns, with only around 1.5% outpacing Bitcoin\u2019s 50x returns.\n\nPerformance of 1,009 altcoins that entered the top 100 since 2015. Source: K33 Research\n\nThe report adds that altcoin investments were only profitable two times since 2015: in 2017, when Ether and XRP were outperforming, and in 2021, during the hype surrounding Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nNotably, during the second half of 2021, when Bitcoin made new all-time highs at $69,000, altcoins posted relatively dull gains, with the exception of ETH.\n\nPositive breakout in Bitcoin\u2019s dominance\n\nBesides a breakout in Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high, breakouts from crucial levels in Bitcoin\u2019s dominance levels are another potent indicator that helps identify long-term trend reversals in altcoins.\n\nAltcoin seasons during the previous two cycles were marked by Bitcoin\u2019s dominance breaking below 60%. After the bullish trend reversal, the bottom in Bitcoin\u2019s dominance also coincided with the top in the total market capitalization of altcoins.\n\nThe total market capitalization of crypto excluding Bitcoin (top) and BTC dominance over the crypto market (below). Source: TradingView\n\nIf history repeats itself, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance could rise further while altcoin performance remains subdued.\n\nA breakout in Bitcoin\u2019s dominance above the 50% level on June 19 \u2014 thanks to BlackRock filing for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund \u2014 has opened room for further altcoin losses, as it marked a crucial historical resistance point.\n\nIn the latter half of the 2008\u20132022 bear market, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance increased to over 70%. On the other hand, it performed relatively better, holding its price above the 2018 lows of around $3,250. K33 Research also shows that this period marked significantly poor altcoin performances, making new lows toward the end.\n\nRelated: Crypto industry \u2018destined\u2019 to be BTC-focused due to regulators: Michael Saylor\n\nThe K33 Research analysts added that while altcoin portfolios have shown the potential for greater profits than Bitcoin, they require \u201ctiming the market or picking the altcoin winners.\u201d Anders Helseth, vice president of research at K33 Research, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cYou can create higher returns by trading market sentiment more aggressively, but it requires a lot of attention, and it is obviously more risky.\"\n\nGiven that Bitcoin has outperformed altcoins over the long run, dollar-cost averaging (DCAing) into Bitcoin can be an effective investment strategy for crypto investors.\n\nTo DCA means to regularly invest a fixed amount of money into a particular asset over a specific period, regardless of the investment\u2019s price, to average the principal amount and remove the need to time the markets. Helseth told Cointelegraph that DCAing is \u201ca sensible, quite safe, simple crypto investment strategy.\u201d\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Shiba Inu Are Rising This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nMost cryptocurrencies rose this week as investors cheered more interest and participation in the sector from large mainstream financial institutions.\n\nThe price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), traded more than 13% higher on the week as of 12:25 p.m. ET Thursday, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Meanwhile, the price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH), traded more than 9% higher, while the price of the meme token Shiba Inu (CRYPTO:SHIB) was up 14.5%.\n\nSo what\n\nHeading into the week, cryptocurrencies seemed to be heading south. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had just sued two of the largest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase Global, and the Federal Reserve indicated that it expects to have to raise interest rates two more times this year, not that the market is entirely buying it.\n\nBut things quickly reversed course when BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, filed with the SEC to launch what would be the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. Unlike past attempts, investors seem more optimistic about BlackRock's chances for approval because BlackRock's application has offered to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with the Nasdaq, the exchange where the ETF would be listed. This agreement would share trading data that regulators believe is critical to preventing market manipulation.\n\nAfter BlackRock submitted an application, other companies followed suit. Also this week, the public learned that a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets, which is backed by Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Citadel Securities, went live and began providing access for customers to trade several crypto tokens including Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nCaitlin Long, the CEO of the crypto bank Custodia Bank, which has not been able to gain access to a Federal Reserve master account, said she thinks the timing of all of these moves by big Wall Street players is no accident.\n\n\"All of a sudden we've got these big Wall Street firms that are coming into crypto right after the runway's been cleared,\" Long told The Defiant this week.\n\nIn other more specific news, Shiba Inu seemed to be benefiting from an update on Shibarium, its Layer 2 protocol that will give Shiba Inu more of its own blockchain network. Shiba Inu is an ERC-20 token, meaning it operates on Ethereum's blockchain.\n\nToday, Shibarium's lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, said that Shibarium will feature what he is calling Shibacals, which will use near-field communication chips to authenticate tangible real-world items digitally with tools like non-fungible tokens.\n\nNow what\n\nCrypto is definitely benefiting from mainstream Wall Street giants wading deeper into the sector. Not only does this help legitimize the industry, but it also creates a path to further integrate cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system, which could increase broader adoption.\n\nObviously, these ETFs still need to get approval, but they do seem to have a much better chance than prior attempts.\n\nUltimately, I continue to view Bitcoin and Ethereum as good long-term investments worth having exposure to. Bitcoin continues to become more universally accepted and has been more resilient during crypto sell-offs. Ethereum's recent upgrade and overall technology have the potential to be used in many different capacities. While I am somewhat intrigued by Shibarium and its technical capabilities, I need to see it in action before considering investing in the meme token."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading above $31,000 after its 24.3% rally between June 15 and June 23, which caught many off guard. For bears, that meant facing $165 million in short futures contract liquidations, but the unexpected rally also brought some degree of discomfort for investors using Bitcoin derivatives.\n\nInflation remains the biggest question mark for traditional markets, a point highlighted by the recent 50-basis-point interest rate increase by the Bank of England, followed by similar moves in Norway and Switzerland, leading to the highest cost of capital in over a decade for the region.\n\nIn response to questions from lawmakers on the United States House Financial Services Committee on June 21, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that \u201cthe process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go\u201d and reiterated that \u201cnearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nAccording to JPMorgan strategists led by Marko Kolanovic, \u201cthe economy\u2019s recent resilience may delay the onset of a recession,\u201d so the impacts of the monetary tightening movement by the central bank are yet to be felt, \u201cand ultimately a recession will likely be necessary to return inflation to target.\u201d\n\nInvestors now question whether Bitcoin has the strength to trade above the $30,000 resistance amid the bearish pressure emerging from a potential economic recession and further central bank activity aimed at curbing the demand for capital.\n\nConsequently, traders should closely monitor Bitcoin futures contract premiums and the costs of hedging using BTC options.\n\nBitcoin derivatives show modest improvement\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, BTC futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe demand for leveraged BTC longs slightly increased as the futures contract premium jumped to 4.3% on June 22 from 3.2% one week prior, although it remains below the neutral 5% threshold.\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become more optimistic. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign of when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe 25% delta skew metric did a complete turnaround as it exited the \u201cfear\u201d mode on June 16 as Bitcoin\u2019s price reclaimed the $26,000 support. The indicator continued to improve until June 22, culminating with the moderate \u201cgreed\u201d sentiment at a negative 8% skew.\n\nRelated: \u2018Bitcoin-only\u2019 buy-and-hold investing outperforms altcoins over long term, analysis shows\n\nThe absence of excessive optimism is a good sign\n\nTypically, a 4.3% futures basis and a negative 8% delta skew would be considered neutral market indicators, but that is not the case given the 21.5% Bitcoin price rally between June 15 and June 22. A certain amount of skepticism is healthy for buyers using derivatives contracts and opens room for further leverage use if needed.\n\nThe heated legal battle between Binance and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission presents a risk for BTC futures contracts. The decisions from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia could severely impact the cryptocurrency market, as Binance holds the biggest market share in the spot and derivatives markets.\n\nUncertainty around the crypto regulatory environment and the growing risks of an economic recession are possible explanations for Bitcoin derivatives traders\u2019 lack of excitement.\n\nApart from those external risks, there is no apparent driver to justify a sharp BTC price correction, giving bulls just the right amount of optimism to keep the positive momentum.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Bitcoin rose above US$30,000 earlier today, following news of institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity and Deutsche Bank entering the crypto space.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Crypto lawsuits, Hinman and a rare rate hike pause\n\nBitcoin rises past US$30,000 for first time since April, with BTC dominance at 2-year high\n\nBitcoin inched down 0.16% from 7:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong to US$30,069. Ether rose 0.79% in the same timeframe, to US$1,908, exceeding US$1,800 for the first time since June 10.\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, exceeded US$30,000 for the first time since April 19.\n\nInvestor sentiment continued to improve after some of the biggest companies in traditional finance announced their venture into the crypto space. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with US$8.59 trillion under management as of the end of 2022, filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, with and market talk hinting that Fidelity is preparing its spot Bitcoin ETF filing. Earlier this week, Germany\u2019s largest bank Deutsche Bank also applied for a license to operate a crypto custody service, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAs recession fears collide with an improving outlook, Bitcoin is testing a cycle-defining technical resistance level. With the removal of regulatory risk, vastly better market structure and stable on-chain activity, the asset looks fairly priced based on some fundamentals,\u201d Jamie Coutts, a senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a research note shared with Forkast.\n\n\u201cAlthough Bitcoin will not be spared from any potential risk asset selloff brought about by a Fed-induced recession, the asset\u2019s risk-reward profile since the start of the year has been the most favorable in four years, based on market structure.\u201d\n\nU.S. Fed chair Colin Powell reportedly said during a monetary policy hearing at Capitol Hill on Wednesday that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have \u201cstaying power\u201d as an asset class, and that the central bank regards stablecoins used for payments as a form of money. He also said that the central bank should have a stronger role in regulating stablecoins.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic token was the day\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 10, rising 8.05% to US$0.7002, followed by Cardano\u2019s ADA token that strengthened 7.98% to US$0.3002.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 4.01% to US$1.18 trillion and market volume increased 21.18% to US$58.25 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nBitcoin dominance remained high at 49.5%, marking a two-year high. April 2021 was the last time Bitcoin dominance exceeded 49%, when Bitcoin was trading above US$53,000.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales rise for fourth consecutive day along with Ethereum NFT sales\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.6% to 2,917.70 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong while inching up 0.13% during the week.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token (NFT) sales rose for a fourth consecutive day, up 194.13% to US$9.78 million, boosted by a 5,203% sales increase in the Neo Yauto collection that generated US$1.12 million for the network. Sales for Uncategorized Ordinals also increased 2.2% to US$7.36 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 12.71% to US$16.64 million, after a sluggish Wednesday. Sales for the largest Ethereum-native collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, increased 3.15% to US$3.57 million and Mutant Ape Yacht Club sales rose 22.33% to US$860,154.\n\nLooking at the day\u2019s most notable NFT sales, NeoYauto Citizen #8330272 was sold for US$334,419 and Bored Ape #2376 sold for US$286,422.\n\nU.S. futures fall after hawkish remarks from Fed chair\n\nImage: JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nMajor Asian equity markets \u2013 China, Hong Kong, Taiwan \u2013 were closed on Thursday due to the Dragon Boat Festival.\n\nU.S. stock futures decreased as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, following Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell\u2019s testimony before Congress that more rate hikes are likely to combat inflation. The S&P 500 futures index fell 0.2%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures lost 0.26% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped 0.16%.\n\n\u201cInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2%,\u201d Powell said. \u201cNearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nInvestors await Powell\u2019s speech to the Senate Banking Committee later today, along with the release of U.S.\u2019 weekly jobless claims report.\n\nAlthough the Fed paused the interest rate hikes on June 14, it projects the interest rate to reach 5.6% in 2023, indicating two more rate hikes within the year. New York Fed President John Williams on Tuesday warned that \u201cwe haven\u2019t said we\u2019re done raising rates,\u201d adding that it will take time for the Fed\u2019s actions to \u201crestore balance to the economy\u201d and return inflation to the 2% target.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 28.1% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in July, and a 71.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, down from 76.9% on Wednesday.\n\nSee related article: Crypto industry reacts to SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin rose and held above US$30,000 in Friday morning trading in Asia, holding onto the strong gains made this week on the back of growing institutional interest in the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ether was little changed. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Cardano\u2019s ADA token gaining and Binance\u2019s BNB losing ground. Overall, most tokens were holding weekly gains spurred by Bitcoin\u2019s rally.\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin rose 0.33% over the last 24 hours to US$30,056.27 at 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, up 17.52% for the past week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency broke through resistance at US$30,000 early morning on Thursday for the first time since April, reaching a high of US$30,737.33.\n\nEther was little changed, rising 0.02% to US$1,879.66 to gain 12.87% for the week.\n\nBlackRock Inc.,the world\u2019s largest asset manager with US$8.59 trillion under management at the end of 2022, filed an application on June 15 for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Two more U.S.-based asset managers \u2014 WisdomTree and Invesco \u2014 also filed Bitcoin ETF applications this week.\n\n\u201cMajor cryptocurrencies were seeing strong performances this week \u2014 Traders reacted positively to the possibility of seeing a Bitcoin ETF come to market,\u201d Denys Peleshok, head of Asia at Belize-based financial brokerage CPT Markets, in email comments.\n\n\u201cA successful launch of a bitcoin ETF could open the way for more inflows from individuals and professional investors alike,\u201d Peleshok added. \u201cThe investment vehicle could lower the barrier of entry into the market and attract significant volumes of investment into bitcoin in particular.\u201d\n\nBoston-based Fidelity Investments, another major financial services company that managed US$4.2 trillion as of the first quarter of 2023, is also said to be preparing to file a Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nIn another encouraging move for institutional adoption of crypto, EDX Markets opened for business on Tuesday as a New Jersey-based digital asset exchange backed by Wall Street firms such as Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab Corp. EDX said U.S. regulatory compliance is a core feature of its operations.\n\nThese moves by traditional finance follow the crackdown on the U.S. crypto sector this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which filed lawsuits against the Binance.US and Coinbase exchanges. The SEC alleges they illegally traded cryptocurrencies that should have been registered as financial securities, among other charges.\n\n\u201c[Bitcoin could] continue benefiting from its status as a quasi-commodity when most other digital assets are considered securities by regulators. As a result, Bitcoin could emerge as a winner from the SEC\u2019s legal efforts,\u201d said Peleshok of CPT Markets.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented on Bitcoin during a monetary policy hearing on Capitol Hill this week, describing the token as having \u201cstaying power\u201d as an asset class.\n\nMeanwhile, Mastercard Inc., the world\u2019s second largest payment processor, announced Thursday that it will expand its Engage network to embrace more blockchain and digital asset partners. Mastercard Engage connects businesses with qualified technology partners.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed, although making weekly gains spearheaded by Bitcoin. Binance\u2019s BNB token lost 2.53% to US$242.49 while gaining 2.36% in the past seven days.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA rose 2.21% to US$0.2922, adding 10.90% in the last week.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market capitalization rose 0.14% to US$1.17 trillion in the last 24 hours, while trading volume fell 25.24% to US$45.06 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT looking up\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.78% to 2,930.17 in the 24 hours to 8:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index gained 1.3% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT transactions rose 0.64% to US$23.9 million, while transactions on Ethereum dipped 3.70% to US$15.56 million. Bitcoin was the second largest blockchain by NFT transactions, rising 8.56% to US$2.74 million.\n\nYuga Labs\u2019 Bored and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs were the top selling collections in the last 24 hours. Bored Ape trades rose 1.12% to US$3.07 million, while Mutant Ape surged 23.92% to US$1.05 million.\n\n\u201cNFT traders are optimistic about the future, and clearly willing to spend as we see from multiple $145k Bored Ape Yacht Club sales, along with a $286k sale, but still the index is just above its all-time low point,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nThat indicates investors remain hesitant as a whole, apart from some whales, said Petscher, adding that may be because of a lack of a track record for some projects holding value over time.\n\nThe Gods Unchained Cards NFT collection from ImmutableX was the third most traded collection, even as transactions fell 8.75% to US$754,805. Immutable announced Wednesday that its NFT trading card game Gods Unchained is now listed on game distribution platform Epic Games Store, which has over 230 million customers.\n\n\u201cLots of eyes on Azuki tomorrow as they have a big event in Las Vegas,\u201d Petscher said. Azuki, the Japanese anime-inspired NFT collection of 10,000 generative avatars, became one of the most popular collections since its debut in January 2022 and still holds an active community.\n\nAzuki is the eighth most traded collection according to Cryptoslam data, with US$537,366 worth of transactions over the past day. \u201cWe\u2019re watching to see what big announcements they may have \u2013 a new token, or possibly a game? Azuki has a track record of delivering on hype,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nElsewhere, Swiss-based multinational food manufacturer Nestl\u00e9 S.A. and U.S.-based snack brand Slim Jim both announced the launch of NFT collections, signaling continued mainstream interest in the blockchain-powered technology.\n\nEquity futures edge down\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell | Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, following a mixed regular trading session on Thursday.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped 0.06%, S&P 500 futures lost 0.11%, while Nasdaq futures inched down 0.084%.\n\nTech stocks gained in the Thursday session performed well with Apple Inc. setting a new record high of US$187, while Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc. also rising.\n\nOn the U.S. battlefront against inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told the U.S. Congress on Tuesday and Thursday this week that the central bank is in consensus that more interest rate increases are likely this year to control high price pressure. The U.S. inflation rate is currently at around 4.05%, down from last month\u2019s 4.93% but still far from Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The Fed paused rate hikes at the last meeting on June 14, but indicated two more hikes this year to bring rates to around 5.6%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on interest rates is July 26 and the majority view is they will raise. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 76.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, up from 71.9% on Thursday, and a 23.1% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

Discover SCENE\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Friday. Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) is scheduled to launch on the Chicago Board Options (CBOE) BZX Exchange next Tuesday, June 27.\n\nAccording to the SEC filing, BITX \u201cseeks investment results that correspond to two times (2x) the return of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index.\u201d\n\nAn ETF, or exchange-traded fund, bundles securities like stocks and commodities. Investors can buy shares of an ETF to gain exposure to those securities without owning them directly. In the case of Bitcoin ETFs, there have been two main types: Bitcoin futures and Bitcoin spot.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe BITX fund will be a leveraged ETF. Leveraged funds use debt or financial derivatives\u2014in this case, Bitcoin futures\u2014as leverage to amplify the returns of a benchmark index. That leverage can mean short-term gains for investors, but it can also lead to big losses.\n\nToday\u2019s news was mostly lauded by cryptocurrency advocates across the market, however it does leave space for some questions.\n\n\u201cWhen we look back on the Bitcoin ETF saga in 5 or 10yrs, this will be one of the most ridiculous aspects... A 2x leveraged futures product launching before a straightforward spot ETF,\u201d Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute wrote on Twitter. He ended his tweet with: \u201cWild.\u201d\n\nWhen we look back on the bitcoin ETF saga in 5 or 10yrs, this will be one of the most ridiculous aspects... A 2x leveraged futures product launching before a straightforward spot ETF. Wild. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) June 23, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, others pointed out that $BITO, the U.S.\u2019s first Bitcoin futures ETF, has underperformed BTC year-to-date, although it did jump on today\u2019s news against its USD pair. The asset notched a 3.45% gain on the day, reaching $17.57, according to Yahoo Finance\u2013still down more than 50% from its all-time high of $43.32 in 2021.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin continues its rally, touching $31,000 today, with a 3.4% gain.\n\nApproving BITX breathes some fresh air into the digital asset industry, after the SEC sued two of the largest crypto exchanges earlier this month. The regulatory agency\u2019s head, Gary Gensler, has proved to be a staunch detractor of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith BlackRock applying for a Bitcoin ETF earlier this week, could this be a sign of the tides turning for the SEC\u2019s turbulent relationship with crypto? It might be a bit early, but the news is no doubt encouraging for investors."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s 15% rally toward $30,300 between June 19 and June 21 caught most traders by surprise, triggering $125 million in liquidations of leveraged short futures contracts. Narrowing down the trigger for the rally is complicated, but some analysts point to the potential inflow of institutional investors if BlackRock\u2019s exchange-traded fund (ETF) application gets regulatory approval.\n\nBlackRock just filed with the SEC to create a spot #Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\n\nGiven their reputation, this has the highest likelihood of happening out of all the attempts at a spot ETF so far.\n\n\n\nThe institutional liquidity floodgates may finally open https://t.co/c9g2Ten1h8 pic.twitter.com/L2NmXq11gL \u2014 Joe Consorti \u26a1 (@JoeConsorti) June 15, 2023\n\nARK Invest CEO and chief investment officer Cathie Wood explained the rationale for the firm\u2019s bullishness on the Bitcoin (BTC) price, specifically its $1 million target. According to Wood, even in a deflationary environment, Bitcoin can still outperform by offering a solution to the traditional financial system\u2019s counterparty risk.\n\nFurthermore, the negative regulatory pressure eased on June 16 after Binance was able to strike a temporary agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to avoid a potential asset freeze. The event further cemented Bitcoin bears\u2019 opportunity to profit on the $715 million weekly BTC options expiry.\n\nBears made a mistake when BTC\u2019s price dropped below $25,000\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price dropped below $26,300 on June 10, fueling bearish bets by traders using options contracts. Such a level was only recouped on June 16, which explains why bears have concentrated their bets on Bitcoin trading below $27,000.\n\nDeribit Bitcoin options aggregate open interest for June 23. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.82 put-to-call ratio reflects the difference in open interest between the $415 million call (buy) options and the $300 million put (sell) options. However, the outcome will be lower, as bears were caught by surprise as Bitcoin gained 10% in two days.\n\nFor instance, if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $29,800 at 8:00 am UTC on June 23, there will be only $5 million in put options. This distinction arises since the right to sell Bitcoin at $28,000 or $29,000 is rendered void if BTC trades above that on the expiry.\n\nBulls are in a good position to capture a $250 million profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on June 23 for call (buy) and put (sell) instruments varies depending on the expiration price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $27,000 and $28,000: 3,500 calls vs. 1,200 puts. The net result favors the call (buy) instruments by $60 million.\n\n3,500 calls vs. 1,200 puts. The net result favors the call (buy) instruments by $60 million. Between $28,000 and $29,000: 7,300 calls vs. 500 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $195 million.\n\n7,300 calls vs. 500 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $195 million. Between $29,000 and $30,000: 8,600 calls vs. 100 puts. The bulls\u2019 advantage increases to $250 million.\n\n8,600 calls vs. 100 puts. The bulls\u2019 advantage increases to $250 million. Between $30,000 and $31,000: 10,400 calls vs. 0 puts. Bulls have total control, profiting $310 million.\n\nThis rough estimate considers only put options in bearish bets and call options in neutral-to-bullish trades. Nonetheless, this oversimplification excludes more complex investment strategies. A trader, for example, could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price, but this effect is difficult to estimate.\n\nRelated: Singapore MAS proposes digital money standards with major industry players\n\nBears will likely try to downplay the multiple Bitcoin ETF applications, including BlackRock\u2019s and WisdomTree\u2019s. Meanwhile, bulls should closely monitor the regulatory changes, including the ongoing investigation of Binance in France, as the Paris Prosecutor\u2019s Office reportedly cited \u201cacts of illegal exercise of the function of a service provider on digital assets (PSAN), and acts of aggravated money laundering.\u201d\n\nThe critical level for the weekly expiration is $28,000, but it is impossible to predict the outcome due to increased cryptocurrency regulatory risks. If bulls are able to profit $250 million or higher, those funds will most likely be used to further strengthen the $28,000 support.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The new CEX made a notable entry with backing from prominent financial institutions such as Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments, Paradigm, Sequoia Capital and Charles Schwab. Currently, the exchange supports trading only four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

The facilities will host over 6,000 Antminer S19 XPs and S19J Pro+s, which are expected to add about one exahash per second (EH/s) to CleanSpark\u2019s hash rate following the deal\u2019s completion. According to Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, the newly acquired infrastructure will enable the company to reach its target of 16 EH/s by the end of 2023. The purchase follows several other acquisitions by CleanSpark in recent months, despite a slump in BTC mining profitability during the bear market.\n\nGemini plans Asia-Pacific expansion as part of \u201cnext wave of growth for crypto\u201d\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Gemini has announced plans to expand into the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region by increasing the staff at the firm\u2019s Singapore office and establishing an engineering division in India. In a blog post, Gemini hinted at \u201clarger\u201d plans for expanding into the region in the next 12 months. \u201cWe believe that APAC will be a great driver of the next wave of growth for crypto and Gemini,\u201d said the exchange. Gemini seemed to be exploring different markets amid the crackdown on many crypto firms in the United States.

It will premiere on CBC\u2019s doc strand \u2018The Passionate Eye\u2019 late this year.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is the presumed pseudonym of the secretive inventor of Bitcoin. They launched the cryptocurrency in 2009, which spread like wildfire across the world and transformed the way many people interact with money and currencies. Less than two years after its inception, Nakamoto vanished, seemingly without a trace.\n\nSearching For Satoshi is billed as \u201ca global detective story\u201d told in a cinematic style. The doc will explore clues Nakamoto left and identify five candidates who may be the enigmatic character, two dead and three alive. There will also be expert commentary from authors, podcasters, traders and Bitcoin miners, to provide insight into Nakamoto\u2019s identity and unpack the story of Bitcoin itself.\n\n\u201cThere are few people in the world who haven\u2019t heard of Bitcoin, but many won\u2019t have heard about the complex mystery surrounding its creator,\u201d said Rachel Job, SVP Non-Scripted at All3Media International. \u201cRevealing a story that has enough plot twists, hidden clues and red herrings to rival the best fictional detective drama, this beautifully crafted documentary takes viewers to the heart of the mystery, thoroughly investigating the evidence and offering incredible access to those involved.\u201d\n\nJob added working with producers such as Paul Kemp Productions, which is behind docs such as The Rise of Jordan Peterson, Nike\u2019s Big Bet and Transformer, was \u201cintegral to our strategy to grow our slate of high-end, globally relevant, premium documentary features.\u201d\n\nPaul Kemp, the doc\u2019s executive producer, added: \u201cUnlocking the greatest mystery of the tech age has been truly fascinating. As Bitcoin continues its staggering growth across the world, I can guarantee that \u2018The Myth of Satoshi\u2019 will only intensify. I\u2019m grateful to be part of shaping this incredible story, and that CBC and All3Media International have so strongly supported my quest.\u201d\n\nNakamoto\u2019s story has previously been told in docs for the likes of France\u2019s Arte. Director Matthew Miele and producer Tucker Tooley were also reported to be making a doc about the origin story. Back in 2018, we reported on a Bitcoin-funded TV drama from the UK called Children of Satoshi.\n\nBitcoin remains decentralized, meaning no government controls it. The system hinges on blockchain technology, and new bitcoin can be created by a process called mining, wherein complex mathematical formulas are solved by machines. Bitcoin is sold via online exchanges, which serve the role that banks would with traditional money."

        "content": "A company behind providing cryptocurrency-linked and other exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for listing shares of a leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF.\n\nVolatility Shares Trust filed Form 8-A with the SEC on June 23, suggesting that the firm was preparing to launch an investment vehicle the regulator could consider a class of securities under its purview. The registration statement listed the Volatility Shares \u201c2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF\" under the ticker symbol BITX, which would offer leveraged exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) corresponding to two times the daily performance of the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index.\n\nThe 2x bitcoin ETF $BITX has become effective, scheduled to launch Tuesday. I was doubtful it would happen but looks like it\u2019s official. Could this be early sign of SEC lightening up? After $BITO launch I believe they made earlier 2x filers withdraw pic.twitter.com/XXxSt9xypu \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 23, 2023\n\nAt the time of publication, the SEC had not explicitly denied the Volatility Shares application for the crypto investment vehicle \u2014 a leveraged BTC futures ETF would be the first of its kind in the United States. Volatility Shares Trust\u2019s website stated it planned to start trading on June 27 but added the registration statement \u201chas not yet become effective.\u201d\n\nA separate SEC Form N-1A filing for listing shares of the leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF on the CBOE BZX Exchange stated that neither the SEC nor the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission had \u201capproved or disapproved these securities or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this prospectus.\u201d The SEC has a pattern of denying many crypto-linked ETF applications.\n\n\"We cannot comment on what the SEC may or may not do,\" a Volatility Shares spokesperson told Cointelegraph. \"What we can say is that the registration statement is now effective, and, in accordance with SEC regulations, we are planning to list BITX for trading.\"\n\nRelated: BlackRock applies for spot Bitcoin ETF \u2014 a US first if approved\n\nWhile the U.S. financial regulator has not approved any spot crypto ETF, it began allowing ETFs linked to BTC futures starting in 2021, including those from Valkyrie and ProShares. In May and June, respectively, Valkyrie applied with the SEC for listing its own leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF as well as a spot BTC ETF.\n\nThe filing came amid the SEC being entrenched in lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase for alleged unregistered securities offerings. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for the removal of SEC Chair Gary Gensler and his perceived \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d approach to crypto firms and others.\n\nMagazine: Gary Gensler\u2019s job at risk, BlackRock\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF and other news: Hodler\u2019s Digest, June 11-17\n\nUpdate (June 23 at 9:14 PM UTC): This article has been updated to include a statement from Volatility Shares Trust."

BTC has risen more than 12% since Tuesday when U.S. markets reopened after a long holiday weekend. Spot bitcoin ETF filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by three financial services giants, including BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, have buoyed investors who had had been reeling earlier this month when the SEC filed lawsuits against exchange powerhouses Binance and Coinbase.\n\nThose suits continue to cloud crypto's future in the U.S., and the agency has yet to approve any of the more than half-dozen ETF applications presented in recent years, or indicate that it is ready to change its mind.\n\n\"This is truly welcome news for the market, but perhaps not quite the beginning of the end of the bear market,\" Tim Frost, CEO of digital wealth platform Yield App, noted cautiously in an email to CoinDesk. \"This pump is likely down to a lot of institutional buying on BlackRock and other institutions\u2019 applications for a Bitcoin spot ETF, which have not been approved. And, if these get rejected by the US SEC like all the others, this may well lead to another tumble.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nEther, the second largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands at $1,880, down about 1.8% from Wednesday, same time. ETH had been holding steady above $1,900 after regaining this level the previous days for the first time since the start of the month.\n\nOther major cryptos were mixed with a few, including ADA, the token of smart contracts platform Cardano, and Litecoin up more than 2%, but others, including MATIC, the native crypto of the Polygon blockchain, off about the same. Increasingly popular memecoin PEPE was up 11%, although it had been up 70% earlier in the day. After spending most of the day in the green, the CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, sank into negative territory and was recently down 0.9%.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 closed up 0.8% and 0.2%, respectively, shrugging off a reiteration of hawkish remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The U.S. central bank said last week that it likely would resume interest rate hikes later this year after ending a more than year-long diet of increases.\n\nYield App's Frost wrote that the most recent surge would \"not be particularly welcome news as this pump is entirely due to centralized institutions in traditional finance becoming more interested (in crypto).\"\n\nBut he added: \"These detractors should really think about the future. Cryptocurrency cannot stay in its own echo chamber forever and it must be accepted and bought by institutions if it is to truly grow and expand.\"\n\nBiggest Gainers\n\nAsset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Shiba Inu SHIB +2.3% Currency Terra LUNA +0.3% Smart Contract Platform\n\nBiggest Losers\n\nInsights\n\nWhat Is BlackRock's Motivation?\n\nThe institutions are taking a fresh look at crypto and they\u2019re flooding in.\n\nLast week, BlackRock (BLK) applied for a spot bitcoin exchange-trade fund (ETF). This week, another comically large asset manager in Invesco (IVZ) reapplied for approval to offer a spot bitcoin ETF. The less-comically large ETF-sponsor WisdomTree also refiled for a spot bitcoin product yesterday (WisdomTree\u2019s filing was initially rejected by the SEC in 2022).\n\nElsewhere in non-bitcoin crypto, a crypto exchange backed by Fidelity, Schwab and Citadel Securities launched in the United States and Deutsche Bank applied for a digital asset license in Germany.\n\nSo yes, the institutions are back. But why did $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock and $1.5 trillion asset manager Invesco decide it was time for the spot bitcoin ETF again? Many have offered convoluted and tinfoil-hat theories (some which I quite like).\n\nTheories like BlackRock is scrambling to backstop Coinbase for some reason or the big firms are acting on behalf of three letter agencies to keep self-custodied bitcoin away from everyday people or that Wall Street can\u2019t let the crypto crowd get too far ahead of them.\n\nThere are more theories out there, but here\u2019s a much simpler one: Financial institutions like making money and offering a spot bitcoin ETF is a way to make money.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nImportant events.\n\nETHGlobal (Toronto)\n\n8:17 a.m. HKT/SGT(12:17 a.m. UTC): Jibun Bank Manufacturing/Services PMIs (June preliminary)\n\n5:15 p.m. HKT/SGT(9:15 a.m. UTC): St. Louis Fed President James Bullard speech\n\nCoinDesk TV\n\nIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of \"First Mover\" on CoinDesk TV:\n\nBitcoin Crosses $30K; Crypto Exchange Backed by Fidelity, Schwab Launches With Additional Investors\n\nBitcoin (BTC) extended its rally after surpassing the $30,000 mark for the second time this year the day before.

Source: Cercatrova\n\nTwo Bitcoin (BTC) advocates \u2014 Cercatrova, the democratically elected president of the German-speaking Bitcoin community Einundzwanzig, and his co-pilot, Daktari \u2014 set off on the orange-pilling adventure this week, attempting to pass through nine Northern European countries in their Bitcoin-branded car.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph from somewhere above the Arctic Circle, Cercatrova explained:\n\n\u201cThe whole rally is a charity rally. There are 150 teams or cars. It starts in Hamburg and goes up to Denmark, Sweden, Norway and around the Baltic Sea. It\u2019s around 8,000 kilometers, 16 days, and we\u2019re the only Bitcoin team here \u2014 none of the other teams are cryptocurrency teams.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to \u201cbring Bitcoin to the people\u201d while also raising money for two sources: a Panamanian coffee farmer and a Salvadoran peer-to-peer ride-sharing app developed on the Lightning Network.

Plus, passersby and overtakers can scan the QR code on the side of the car to receive free satoshis, or small amounts of Bitcoin, to get started on their Bitcoin journey.\n\n\u201cSo, when somebody sees us and asks about Bitcoin \u2014 \u2018How does it work?\u2019 \u2014 we can actually take the people to our car and say, \u2018Okay, just install a wallet and it\u2019s done in about 30 seconds.\u2019 And they\u2019re amazed: \u2018I didn\u2019t have to fill out anything, didn\u2019t have to take a passport or whatever. It just works.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe car is also equipped with a candy machine that accepts Bitcoin, so newbies can spend their brand-new sats on candy, \u201cjust to see how it works,\u201d Cercatrova explained.\n\nThe team's location in northern Norway. Source: Superlative Adventure Club\n\nFor the Bitcoin enthusiasts following at home, the car is Lightning-ready. A remote-play jukebox and a Lightning-switch horn can be operated from all around the world.

The process uses a Lightning switch that turns on when it has received enough sats. Cercatrova explains:\n\n\u201cOn my Twitter feed is also the QR code, where you can scan the Lightning invoice. And when you pay that, it\u2019s about 3,000 sats to honk it once. And then our car honks!\u201d\n\nThe honk is comically loud and playful, while the Lightning jukebox playlist has featured music ranging from metal to Mozart and German folk tunes to crypto classics such as \u201cPump It Up.\u201d Cercatrova explained that the musical variation is a great source of fun and motivation:\n\n\u201cOne time there is death metal, and the other side it\u2019s Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony, and it\u2019s really crazy.\u201d\n\nTo date, the Bitcoin Ambassadors rally team has raised approximately 4 million satoshis ($1,200) for charity, although Cercatrova added that \u201cthe next days and the willingness to send more sats\u201d could drive the number higher. The drivers are about halfway through the journey, expecting to finish by the end of June.\n\nRelated: Wen Lambo fixed?

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin has gained sudden popularity due to corporate emergence in the industry\n\nTechnological advances are speeding up the process\n\nPrices are expected to soar and supply is expected to shrink in the upcoming period\n\nThe Bitcoin market has been hit with a staggering amount of news in June. It\u2019s interesting to see how the news affected Bitcoin prices in real-time.\n\nAt first, Bitcoin, during the first two weeks of June, saw a slight drop due to the news regarding Binance, the world\u2019s biggest exchange, facing lawsuits filed by the SEC. The second biggest exchange, Coinbase, was also on the receiving end of the SEC\u2019s wrath against the crypto market.\n\nHowever, in the third week, the tides went the other way. It all started when Blackrock, the world\u2019s biggest asset management firm, officially applied for a spot Bitcoin trading ETF, signaling big money entering the market.\n\nSimultaneously, Binance, the same exchange mentioned above, announced integrating the Bitcoin Lightning Network, a technology that promises faster and cheaper transactions. Less than two days later, a new crypto exchange emerged under the name of EDX Markets. The news of its emergence would\u2019ve gone by unnoticed hadn\u2019t its backing come from some of the world\u2019s biggest corporations.\n\nThe logical question is: Why Bitcoin especially? And how long should we expect this rising interest in Bitcoin to continue?\n\nBitcoin Go Brrr\n\nFollowing the negative news above, Bitcoin saw a slight drop from ~$26,000 to ~$25,000 in the first couple of weeks.\n\nUnderstandably, the market reacted negatively to the news of the world\u2019s biggest exchange potentially going under due to legal challenges, with its first alternative possibly facing the same fate. Binance even had to halt all USD transactions as a result of the SEC\u2019s attack, along with a suspension of all Over The Counter trades.\n\nThen, the news broke out about Blackrock applying for that ETF. To put things into perspective, Blackrock manages assets worth over $9 trillion with a portfolio that includes shares in companies such as Spotify and Uber.\n\nEver since, several investment and asset management companies expressed interest in the Bitcoin market. Fidelity, the world\u2019s third-largest asset management firm was rumored to either apply for its own ETF and/or takeover a digital management firm called Grayscale.\n\nFidelity was instead brought up in the announcement regarding the launch of EDX Markets, the new crypto exchange to look out for. Fidelity is joined by Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities in backing the new crypto exchange.\n\nEDXM, however, is planning on only allowing trades of Bitcoin, LiteCoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum, which are the only cryptocurrencies the SEC doesn\u2019t mind being traded by these companies.\n\nEven more interestingly, Valkyrie, a financial services company with assets managed worth over $80 billion, has filed for Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) with the SEC. The idea is to bridge the old financial system, Traditional Finance (TradFi), and the new one, Decentralized Finance (DeFi). As a result, by investing money into Valkyrie, investors are staking their funds on Bitcoin managed by the financial institution.\n\nHigher Demand, Lower Supply\n\nKnowing that Bitcoin is bound to increase in value following all the news above, the demand for its purchase caused a higher-than-usual outflow. Some trading prices spotted included $30,000, $31,000, $32,000, and even $40,000.\n\nA similar outflow occurred during the first couple of weeks in June, but that\u2019s because some hodlers were panic selling, fearing a slump in value.\n\nWhether this rising value trend will continue is technically anyone\u2019s guess. However, all signs show a consistently increasing interest in the market, especially from the corporate side.\n\nCorporations such as Blackrock, Fidelity, and Valkyrie would naturally want to get their hands on the biggest sum of Bitcoin possible, enabling themselves to control market prices and flow.\n\nWith only a limited amount of Bitcoin available, the supply of the cryptocurrency is bound to shrink significantly in the upcoming period, causing its price to soar."

        "content": "Illustration by TradingView\n\nAfter facing some headwinds since April this year at around the $30,000 mark, Bitcoin has been making a bit of a comeback this week. Since the week began, BTC has logged a more than 14% gain in a positive sign for the space. BTC is now sitting at a price of around $30,000, with some analysts suggesting that the cryptocurrency could soon cross back over the $30,400 mark, and if it were to break through $31,035 \u2013 it would be the highest BTC price seen since June 2022.\n\nThe cause of the optimism lies in the recent spot Bitcoin ETF filings, which have been made by major institutional players such as BlackRock. Whether those ETFs will be approved however, is a different story. Firstly because they would be the first of their kind and secondly because the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (which would be responsible for approving them) has been taking a decidedly anti-crypto stance recently with its latest enforcement actions against major crypto exchanges such as Binance.\n\n(About Bitcoin)\n\nBitcoin is the original decentralized digital currency that was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions can occur directly between users without the need for intermediaries like banks. Bitcoin uses cryptography to secure transactions and to control the creation of new units of the currency. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, which allows anyone to verify the validity of a transaction and the ownership of bitcoins. The total supply of bitcoins is limited to 21 million, which is expected to be reached around the year 2140. Bitcoin's price is highly volatile, and it has experienced numerous boom and bust cycles over the years."

This is in keeping with its cautious approach to the crypto market. In fact, last week the SEC sued two crypto exchanges, Coinbase and Binance, on the basis that they have failed to register as a securities trading venue.\n\nThe SEC maintains that digital assets should be treated the same way as conventional securities and subject to the same rules.\n\nThe likes of Binance and Coinbase have pressed for a new regulatory framework that caters specifically for digital or crypto assets.\n\nThe licence applications have led to speculation that the SEC might approve its first crypto ETF which in turn has seen a bump in the price of bitcoin which rose from less than $25,000 to more than $26,000 in the immediate aftermath of the BlackRock application.\n\nBitcoin has since surged beyond $30,000 for the first time since April and only the second time in 2023.\n\nIt is not the first time that asset managers have made such an application to the SEC. WisdomTree has seen its application rejected twice (in December 2021 and October 2022) due to concerns about fraud and market manipulation.\n\nBlackRock has attempted to assuage these fears by entering into a \u201csurveillance sharing agreement\u201d with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures markets.\n\nAnd WisdomTree has adopted a similar strategy, stating that it is willing to also enter a surveillance agreement with the operator of a US-based spot trading platform for Bitcoin."

        "content": "\n\n\n\nThe recently concluded Bitcoin 2023 Conference in Miami, Florida, witnessed an exciting announcement that has the potential to impact Mexico's economy significantly. CEO of Ibex Mercado, Jose Lemus, took the stage to unveil a groundbreaking collaboration with Grupo Salinas, one of Mexico's largest corporate conglomerates. This partnership aims to revolutionise how millions of Mexicans pay their internet bills by introducing the Bitcoin Lightning Network.\n\n\n\nThe significance of this collaboration lies in the fact that Grupo Salinas owns numerous businesses across Mexico, and its founder, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, is not only a billionaire but also a well-known Bitcoin advocate. With such influential backing, the partnership drives widespread Bitcoin adoption among Mexicans.\n\nLemus emphasised that this is just the beginning, envisioning a future where other major entities within the Salinas conglomerate, such as Best Buy, Bank of America, Fox News, and even an NFL team, embrace the Lightning Network's capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nLemus believes that the collaboration between Ibex Mercado and Grupo Salinas represents a fundamental step towards realising the full potential of the Lightning Network. The plans go beyond enabling Bitcoin payments for internet bills; they involve developing Lightning apps for employees and soccer teams, drawing inspiration from the successful Bitcoin initiatives implemented by the Australian baseball team, Perth Heat, in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nIbex Mercado recognises the tremendous potential for financial inclusion the Lightning Network offers. In the past, the company successfully integrated the Lightning Network for El Salvador's Chivo Wallet, providing millions of Salvadorans with access to essential banking services. By expanding Bitcoin adoption in Mexico, Lemus aims to go beyond basic banking services and empower unbanked and underserved populations, opening up new avenues for raising funds for companies and accessing broader markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile living entirely on Bitcoin in Mexico may still take some time, Lemus suggests that within approximately 18 months, conducting most daily activities with the crypto could become feasible. However, certain aspects may still require traditional fiat transactions. The collaboration between Ibex Mercado and Grupo Salinas, which has been in the making for 18 months, is just the beginning. Lemus hints at more partnerships and projects for Mexico's Bitcoin landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico's increasing interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption, evident through establishing crypto remittance companies and expanding crypto exchanges, positions the country at the forefront of a digital revolution. With Jose Lemus's vision and key players' collaborative efforts, Mexico is poised to shape its economic landscape by embracing the transformative power of digital currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist. Twitter: @bhardwajshash"

Source: CramerTracker\n\nYear-to-date, BTC soared by more than 80%. Remarkably, over the past week alone, Bitcoin has surged by an impressive 17%, exemplifying its resolute upward trajectory. The cryptocurrency\u2019s value soared from $25,500 to above $30,000, resulting in a substantial boost of $80 billion to its market capitalization.\n\nSuch overwhelming Bitcoin ETF interest from esteemed institutional investors like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), Invesco, and WisdomTree has undoubtedly contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge, further reinforcing its position as a digital asset of immense significance.\n\nCramer issues caution in March\n\nBack in March, Cramer expressed his belief that Bitcoin is an enigmatic entity subject to manipulation, pointing to Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s alleged involvement in its manipulation.\n\nWith an air of skepticism, he cautioned against assuming that such manipulation had ceased, stating, \u201cI think it is being manipulated up.

Kennedy Jr., presidential candidate for the Democratic Party, spoke to The New York Post yesterday about several of his views regarding cryptocurrency, central bank digital currencies, and AI, among other topics.\n\nThe 69-year old has not shied away from controversy, nor addressing views that might not be aligned with mainstream narratives.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMajor Bitcoin miners Hut 8 Mining and U.S. Bitcoin Corp are set to merge to create a North American crypto mining giant.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the U.S.-domiciled company\u2014named Hut 8 Corp.\u2014will have a market capitalization of $990 million and shareholders will have equal ownership of the company\u2019s stock.\n\nAs first reported by TheMinerMag, its new hashrate of 7.5 EH/s will make it one of the biggest public Bitcoin miners in North America, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Marathon Digital (MARA) is still far and away the most dominant with 23 EH/s of installed capacity. But the post-merger company will be closer in size to Riot Blockchain (RIOT), which has 10.5 EH/s capacity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHashrate\u201d refers to the computational power of the network. Each hash represents a \u201cguess\u201d at a cryptographic code. The miner whose rig correctly guesses it wins the right to verify a block worth of transactions and add it to the blockchain, thereby collecting a block reward. So having a higher hashrate means more chances to collect those rewards. One exahash is equal to one quintillion hashes.\n\nBitcoin miners were recently hit hard by the crypto winter. A dramatic drop in the price of the largest digital asset from its $69,044 November 2021 all-time high meant some mining operations were struggling to make profit and had to flog their crypto reserves or shut down completely.\n\nAt one point, publicly traded Bitcoin miners, Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain, had to sell more Bitcoin than they produced. Other companies closed their doors completely.\n\nBut things are on-the-up: The price of Bitcoin has surged this year, outpacing the increases in difficulty, meaning more mining companies could keep the lights on and make profit. Hut 8 Mining is one of those companies\u2014it has a healthy supply of working capital and negative net debts, according to TheMinerMag stats.\n\n\u201cThe benefit is Hut 8 is financially healthier than many others with nearly 10,000 BTC on its balance sheet and very minimal debt,\u201d MinerMag analyst Wolfie Zhao told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHut 8\u2019s current holdings stand at 9,233 BTC, worth roughly $277 million at current prices, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. The only other publicly traded miner with a larger stash is Marathon Digital, which holds 12,232 BTC\u2014worth today over $364.2 million.\n\nThe miner can also boast of not having to sell large amounts of its BTC holdings when other public miners have had to during last year's market downturn.\n\nThis merger will help it take advantage of its financial position and grow its revenue with a larger self-mining capacity and a more diversified business model, Zhao added.\n\nHut 8 has told Decrypt about its model of diversification: the miner has five data centers, unrelated to Bitcoin mining, which provide an income stream that's detached from crypto market prices. The miner also earlier this month signed an agreement with Canadian public health company Interior Health to handle its data center needs.\n\nAnd just today, it announced an agreement to host approximately 6,400 ASIC miners to grow its capacity. It said that the new machines will increase its installed hashrate to approximately 3.2 EH/s. Hut 8 has also successfully pivoted to the world of high performance computing, or HPC. CEO Jaime Leverton previously told Decrypt that it wanted to \u201cpotentially leveraging our GPU machines to provide AI, machine learning, or VFX rendering services to customers.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. is becoming an increasingly difficult place for the crypto industry to function: The SEC has hit high-profile crypto companies with lawsuit after lawsuit and its chair has even said that the States doesn\u2019t \u201cneed more digital currency.\u201d\n\nBut Bitcoin miners don\u2019t seem particularly fazed. Experts told Decrypt that regulators are more focused on what they see as unregistered securities being sold on exchanges and are unlikely to enact a nationwide ban on Bitcoin mining, like with what was seen in China.\n\nEditor's Note: This article was updated to reflect that by the end of May, Hut 8's Bitcoin treasury was 9,233 BTC.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

The Lake Mariner facility can expand by another 100 MW in the near term and up to 500 MW in total. At the nuclear-powered Nautilus facility, TeraWulf retains the option to expand its mining capacity by 50 MW.\n\n\u201cOur two sites were strategically developed with expansion potential as a key characteristic. Everything from our power import capacity to the layout of our warehouses and racks is designed to grow,\u201d said Paul Prager, Chairman and CEO of TeraWulf. \u201cScalability and adaptability are vital, and our Lake Mariner and Nautilus facilities possess both. With today\u2019s announcement, having achieved 5.5 EH/s and 160 MW of Bitcoin mining capacity as promised, we look forward to now setting our sights on future growth.\u201d\n\nTeraWulf has also developed a strong, collaborative relationship with the leading mining equipment manufacturer, BITMAIN, which supports preferred access and advantaged cost structures for ASIC miners. Bozhao Yu, Antminer Sales Director of NCSA Region, BITMAIN commented, \u201cThe achievement of 5.5 EH/s of mining capacity marks a key milestone for TeraWulf. With a combination of BITMAIN Antminers, including S19 XP Pro miners, which have an energy efficiency of 21.5 J/TH, and S19j Pro and S19 Pro miners, which have an energy efficiency of 29.5 J/TH, the Company has one of the most efficient mining fleets in the sector. We are confident in TeraWulf\u2019s vertically integrated, sustainable, and low-cost business as we continue to expand our long-term partnership with the Company.\u201d\n\nAbout TeraWulf\n\nTeraWulf (Nasdaq: WULF) owns and operates vertically integrated, environmentally clean Bitcoin mining facilities in the United States. Led by an experienced group of energy entrepreneurs, the Company currently has two Bitcoin mining facilities: its wholly-owned Lake Mariner facility in New York, and the Nautilus Cryptomine facility in Pennsylvania, a joint venture with Cumulus Coin, LLC.

        "content": "Do Kwon, a trash-talking entrepreneur from South Korea, called the cryptocurrency he created in 2018 \u201cmy greatest invention.\u201d In countless tweets and interviews, he trumpeted the world-changing potential of the currency, Luna, rallying a band of investors and supporters he proudly referred to as \u201cLunatics.\u201d\n\nMr. Kwon\u2019s company, Terraform Labs, raised more than $200 million from investment firms such as Lightspeed Venture Partners and Galaxy Digital to fund crypto projects built with the currency, even as critics questioned its technological underpinnings. Luna\u2019s total value ballooned to more than $40 billion, creating a frenzy of excitement that swept up day traders and start-up founders, as well as wealthy investors.\n\nMr. Kwon dismissed concerns with a taunt: \u201cI don\u2019t debate the poor.\u201d\n\nBut last week, Luna and another currency that Mr. Kwon developed, TerraUSD, suffered a spectacular collapse. Their meltdowns had a domino effect on the rest of the cryptocurrency market, tanking the price of Bitcoin and accelerating the loss of $300 billion in value across the crypto economy. This week, the price of Luna remained close to zero, while TerraUSD continued to slide.\n\nThe downfall of Luna and TerraUSD offers a case study in crypto hype and who is left holding the bag when it all comes crashing down. Mr. Kwon\u2019s rise was enabled by respected financiers who were willing to back highly speculative financial products. Some of those investors sold their Luna and TerraUSD coins early, reaping substantial profits, while retail traders now grapple with devastating losses."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSustainability-focused Bitcoin miner CleanSpark has agreed to purchase two ready-to-use mining facilities for $9.3 million in Dalton, Georgia, continuing a trend of weighty investments into the mining industry this year.\n\nThe deal, scheduled to close later this week, is expected to add nearly 1 exahash per second of mining capacity to CleanSpark\u2019s fleet. One exahash is equal to 1 quintillion hashes.\n\n\n\nMining rigs work by generating hashes\u2014or guesses\u2014as fast as they can to be the first to solve a complex math problem in order to create Bitcoin\u2019s next block. A higher hashrate means better odds of winning the Bitcoin (BTC) rewards attached to the network\u2019s next block, meaning greater profits for the firm.\n\n\u201cThis acquisition ensures that we have more than enough infrastructure to reach our year-end target of 16 EH/s,\u201d said Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, in a press release. \u201cIt also continues to position us as one of the most power-efficient miners on an energy-per-hash rate basis.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new facilities will consist of 6,000 Antminer S19 XPs and S19J Pro+ mining rigs ordered by CleanSpark earlier this year. The former machine boasts a power efficiency of 21.5 joules per terahash (J/TH), making it among the most efficient machines available according to Hashrate Index.\n\nFor Bitcoin miners, keeping their business profitable is very much about increasing hashrate and keeping facility costs, like energy and maintenance, down. To that end, CleanSpark has already spent more than $200 million buying new rigs this year.\n\nBack in February, CleanSpark bought 20,000 S19J Pro+s machines for $13.15 per terahash ($/TH)\u2014a total of $43.6 million. It later purchased 45,000 S19 XPs in April for $23/TH, or roughly $144 million, after which it used some of its existing machines to collateralize a loan to buy even more equipment.\n\nIn June, the company acquired another fleet of 12,500 S19 XPs for $23/TH ($40.5 million), of which 6,000 are scheduled to arrive this month.\n\nCleanSpark CFO Gary A. Vecchiarelli said the company\u2019s latest acquisition has already been paid for by existing cash reserves and is expected to almost immediately start generating revenue.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe continue to make use of opportunities created by current market conditions to prepare for next year\u2019s bitcoin halving,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is a scheduled 50% reduction in Bitcoin\u2019s issuance rate that occurs roughly once every four years. The next halving is expected to occur in April 2024, reducing the number of Bitcoin per block from 6.25 to 3.125.\n\nBitcoin halvings have historically been followed by bull markets that take the asset\u2019s price to new highs the following year. Indeed, many other mining firms including Iris Energy and Blockstream appear to be investing in mining in preparation for the event.\n\n"

Discover SCENE\n\nThe list of mobile games that pay players cryptocurrency has just grown significantly. Today, Bitcoin payments startup Zebedee launched a feature in its Android app today that pays people small amounts of Bitcoin for playing what it says are over 100 eligible mobile games.\n\nZebedee\u2019s Android app, called ZBD, now offers a broader selection of playable games that include Bitcoin rewards thanks to a new partnership with advertising platform Adjoe and its Playtime network. The games use a time-based rewards model that pays players satoshis\u2014or the smallest unit of Bitcoin (1/100,000,000 BTC)\u2014for each minute they play.\n\nAccording to the company, eligible games with Bitcoin rewards through the ZBD Android app include Candivore\u2019s puzzle game Match Masters and Social Point\u2019s city-builder and creature-battler Dragon City.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll three games have a significant player base, with at least 10 million downloads apiece on Google\u2019s Play Store.

Players will earn satoshis as they play, which are then held within the ZBD wallet and can be withdrawn to another wallet or compatible exchange.\n\nZebedee\u2019s tech platform already powers a number of games that pay players Bitcoin rewards, including iOS and Android games like Hellfire, Bitcoin Miner, and Bitcoin Chess.

        "content": "A majority of the top crypto tokens dropped sharply during the early day on Friday on the back of profit booking. Traders remain concerned about the US SEC lawsuits filed against exchange powerhouses Binance and Coinbase, despite spot Bitcoin ETF filings with the US market regulator by three financial giants.\n\nBitcoin saw some profit booking after the gains of two days as the largest crypto token dropped about a per cent but managed to hold $30,000-mark. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was also trading lower and dropped about 2 per cent to slip below the $1,900-level. However, pain in the other altcoins was severe.\n\nMarkets have slipped after a three-day rally. The crypto fear and greed index has registered no movement. Bitcoins price is beginning to stall after the BTC ETF excitement within the market. Though we can expect the BTC price to hold firmly around the current levels with support at $29,700, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\"Institutional entry into the crypto market has shifted the narrative and investor sentiment away from regulatory developments from last week. Furthering this case, French regulators have granted registration to CACEIS, the asset servicing division of banking giants Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Santander, allowing them to provide crypto custody services,\" he said.\n\nBarring the US dollar-pegged stablecoins, all other top crypto tokens were trading lower on Friday. BNB dropped about 5 per cent, while Solana and XRP declined 4 per cent. Dogecoin and Polygon shed 3 per cent each. Litecoin, Cardano and Shina Inu were other laggards.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly lower, falling to $1.17 trillion-mark as it dropped more than a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes plunged more than 32 per cent to $40.41 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has surged to over $30,000 for the first time in two months after recent filing of multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications. The surge came after the recent filing of spot bitcoin ETF applications by BlackRock, Invesco, and other large asset management firms has given investors hope that the crypto market is starting to recover, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"Spot bitcoin ETFs are designed to track the price of bitcoin directly, and their approval would allow investors to buy and sell bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. The recent developments could help to stabilize the crypto market and pave the way for further growth in the future,\" it said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nEthereum has retraced some gains from earlier this week. The ETH/USD pair is currently attempting a rebound after failing to break the $1,950 resistance level. After a period of corrections and consolidations, ETH has started showing signs of appreciation by breaking out of its descending channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe asset is currently trading above its 100-day moving average of $1,844 which acts as an immediate support level. The RSI reading is currently at 58, slightly in overbought territory. If ETH is unable to break through the $1,900 barrier this week, the price may consolidate around $1,850 levels for a while.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,845, $1,795\n\nResistance: $1,900, $1,950\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Thu 22 Jun 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nMany believe that the 2024 Bitcoin Halving will be decisive for the cryptocurrency. But instead of waiting a few months to cheer up the crypto community, BTC took many by surprise today. It traded at $138,000 early in the morning on Binance.US.\n\nA short-lived ATH for Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin, the only crypto that really counts, will never cease to amaze us. Apart from its June 20 performance, the queen of cryptocurrencies has once again surprised on Binance US.\n\nAccording to CoinDesk, the Bitcoin price has temporarily increased today. Earlier in the morning, at 6:50 UTC, the cryptocurrency was traded at $138,070. Data from the US exchange indeed demonstrated this sudden price surge on the BTC/Tether pair.\n\nTemporary Bitcoin (BTC) ATH \u2013 Source: Binance US\n\nIt is worth noting that this price increase lasted only a few seconds. As of the writing of this article, BTC is trading at $29,038.\n\nWe would also like to point out that the parity of Bitcoin with other spot markets did not experience this temporary price increase.\n\nExplaining this price roller coaster\n\nSome analysts claim that this movement displayed by the queen of cryptocurrencies came from a trader\u2019s provocation. This individual would have offered a 450% premium for BTC.\n\nOthers, more objective, point to the low liquidity of Bitcoin versus Tether on Binance\u2019s US subsidiary\u2019s platform.\n\nThis is explained by market depth data. Market depth refers to the liquidity of a financial market. A purchase of $400,000 worth of bitcoins on the BTC/Tether exchange pair, for example, will increase the price by 2%.\n\nHowever, the effect will not be the same for the BTC/USD exchange pair if purchases approach $842,000.\n\nIt should also be noted that Binance.US\u2019s market depth has fallen sharply, based on May statistics. According to Kaiko, it dropped to -76%.\n\nIn other words, market makers and traders have already jumped ship at Binance US.\n\nAnd they have good reason for this massive departure: the aggressive regulation initiated by the SEC is no incentive to remain involved in this crypto exchange. To the question \u201cShould we flee Binance?\u201c, these players have chosen to answer in the affirmative.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!
