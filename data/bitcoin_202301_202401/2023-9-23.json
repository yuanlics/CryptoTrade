        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether drop; top cryptos retreat with Toncoin leading losers - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell Monday morning in Asia to trade below US$26,300. Ether also dipped and remained below the US$1,600 mark. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were down. Toncoin led the losers with a slide of over 4% over the past 24 hours. The retreat in cryptos follows the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish policy stance at its September meeting. Although it paused interest hikes, the Fed signalled another raise to come by the end of the year, with rates to remain higher for longer than anticipated. U.S. stock futures were up during early morning trading in Asia. All three major U.S. indexes closed lower on Friday for a week of losses.\n\nBitcoin below US$26,300 with more declines expected\n\nBitcoin dropped 1.22% in the last 24 hours to US$26,252.57 as of 07:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency posted a weekly loss of 0.91%. It was hovering above US$26,500 over the weekend but lost the support line early Monday morning.\n\n\u201cOverall, the trend is down and stays bearish,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, wrote in a report Monday.\n\nAs Bitcoin failed to break its 50-day moving average of US$26,876, more downward movement is expected.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin trades below US$26,000 then the market might attempt another break lower,\u201d Thielen said. He added that \u201cOctober tends to be seasonal bullish for Bitcoin, but we would stay cautious without a break above its 50d MA.\u201d\n\nEther dipped 0.86% to US$1,579.12, trading 2.52% lower for the week. The world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency fell below the US$1,600 support level for the first time since Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe mostly worry about Ethereum as weak fundamentals plus a lack of hype around the EIP-4844 upgrade (which should come sometime in Q4 2023) could make the blockchain slowly obsolete,\u201d said Thielen.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s failure to rally above US$1,650 is of the utmost concern as a break lower could have major implications for the altcoin sentiment,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nStory continues\n\nEIP-4844, also known as the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade, is a proposed Ethereum upgrade that aims to improve the speed and cost-effectiveness of the Ethereum network.\n\nThe average fee on the Ethereum blockchain dropped to around US$1.15 per transaction on Saturday, the lowest level since December 2022, according to blockchain intelligence firm Santiment.\n\n\ud83e\udd11 #Ethereum network fees have dropped down to its lowest level of 2023, at just $1.15 per transaction. Historically, we see utility begin rising as $ETH becomes more affordable to circulate. Increased utility can then lead to recovering market cap levels. https://t.co/MpOLfMYKUp pic.twitter.com/JI8ZLhmb4p \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 23, 2023\n\n\u201cHistorically, we see utility begin rising as $ETH becomes more affordable to circulate. Increased utility can then lead to recovering market cap levels,\u201d wrote Santiment in a Saturday Twitter post.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted losses for the past 24 hours. Toncoin led the losers, falling 4.22% to US$2.20 for a weekly loss of 3.98%. But the native token of the Open Network (TON) still posted a monthly rise of more than 50%\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.0% in the past 24 hours to US$1.04 trillion, while trading volume edged up 8.42% to US$17.64 billion.\n\nU.S. equities traders were \u2018overly optimistic\u2019 ahead of Fed meeting\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading higher as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. Wall Street closed lower on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average leading the losers with a 0.31% drop.\n\nAll three major U.S. indexes closed the week lower. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq dropped 2.93% and 3.62% respectively, both registering their largest weekly declines since March.\n\nMost major Asian stock indexes were down Thursday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all dropped. The Hang Seng led the losses with a 0.99% decline while Japan\u2019s Nikkei was up 0.61%.\n\nInvestors are digesting the Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish monetary policy outlook. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday kept its interest rates unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50%, but revised its economic projection to indicate one more interest rate hike by the end of 2023. It also projects slower-than-expected rate cuts throughout 2024.\n\nZachary Hill, head of portfolio management at the U.S.-based investment manager Horizon Investments, told Reuters on Saturday that the past week has seen \u201csome Fed messaging colliding with overly optimistic equity investors.\u201d\n\nThose investors have \u201cwanted to trade peak interest rates for almost a year now.\u201d But the Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech and the Fed\u2019s projection showed that the central bank \u201cdoesn\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet,\u201d said Hill.\n\nFollowing the Fed\u2019s remarks, U.S. 10-year treasury yields closed at 4.44% on Friday, after briefly rising above 4.5% on Thursday for the first time since 2007.\n\nExplaining the central bank\u2019s hawkish stance, Fed governor Michelle Bowman said on Friday the latest consumer price index (CPI) indicated a rise in inflation. That coincides with rising oil prices. Bowman said that the continued risk of rising energy prices could \u201creverse some of the progress\u201d she said has been made on inflation in recent months.\n\n\u201cI expect it will likely be appropriate for the Committee to raise rates further and hold them at a restrictive level for some time to return inflation to our 2 percent goal in a timely way,\u201d Bowman added.\n\nThe global oil price benchmark Brent futures traded at around US$92 as of 10:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. That is an increase of over 11% in the past 30 days. Morgan Stanley on Thursday raised its fourth-quarter Brent forecast from US$82.5 per barrel to US$95. But the U.S. investment giant said a price above US$100 would seem \u201cstretched\u201d, according to a note viewed by Reuters.\n\nThe Fed meets on Nov. 1 to make its next decision on interest rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 74.6% chance of no interest rate hike in November, up from 73.8% on Friday. It also gives a 59.3% chance of another pause in December, up from 54.8% on Friday.\n\nElsewhere, S&P on Monday lowered its projection for China\u2019s 2023 economic growth from 5.2% to 4.8%. It cited the country\u2019s limited fiscal and monetary easing policies as reasons for the decline.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "Crypto traders shift focus to 4 altcoins as Bitcoin price flatlines - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight range for the past three days, even with the S&P 500 falling for the last four days of the week. This is a positive sign, as it shows that cryptocurrency traders are not panicking and rushing to the exit.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s supply seems to be gradually shifting to stronger hands. Citing Glassnode data, analyst CryptoCon said that Bitcoin\u2019s short-term holders (STHs) \u2014 investors who have held their coins for 155 days or less \u2014 are holding the least amount of Bitcoin supply in more than a decade.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nIn the short term, the uncertainty regarding Bitcoin\u2019s next directional move may be keeping traders at bay and could be one of the reasons for the subdued price action in several large altcoins. However, it\u2019s not all negative across the board, with several altcoins showing signs of recovery in the near term.\n\nCould Bitcoin shake out from its slumber and start a bullish move in the near term? Would that act as a catalyst for an altcoin rally? Let\u2019s look at the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may lead the charge higher.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nThe bulls have managed to sustain Bitcoin\u2019s price above the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of $26,523, but they have failed to start a strong rebound. This indicates a lack of demand at higher levels.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe flattish 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint show a status of equilibrium between the buyers and sellers. A break below the 20-day EMA will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. The BTC/USDT pair could then descend to the formidable support at $24,800.\n\nAlternatively, if the price rises from the current level and climbs above the 50-day simple moving average of $26,948, it will signal that buyers are back in the driver\u2019s seat. The pair may then attempt a rally to the overhead resistance at $28,143.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nWhile BTC has been trading below the moving averages on the 4-hour chart, the bears have failed to start a downward move. This suggests that selling is drying up at lower levels. Meanwhile, the bulls will try to propel Bitcoin\u2019s price above the moving averages. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $27,400 and subsequently to $28,143.\n\nIf the bears want to seize control, they will have to sink and sustain BTC\u2019s price below $26,200. That could first yank it down to $25,750 and then to the $24,800 support level.\n\nChainlink price analysis\n\nChainlink (LINK) surged above the downtrend line on Sept. 22, indicating a potential trend change in the near term.\n\nLINK/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating that the buyers have the upper hand. On any correction, the bulls are likely to buy the dips to the 20-day EMA of $6.55. A strong rebound off this level will suggest a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips.\n\nThe bulls will then try to extend the up-move to $8 and eventually to $8.50. If the bears want to prevent that up-move, they will have to sink and sustain the LINK/USDT pair below the 20-day EMA.\n\nLINK/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up on the 4-hour chart and the RSI is in the positive zone. The bulls have been buying the dips to the 20-EMA, indicating a positive sentiment. If LINK\u2019s price rebounds off the 20-EMA, $7.60 will then be the upside target to watch.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if Chainlink\u2019s price continues lower and skids below the 20-EMA, it will signal profit-booking by the bulls. LINK may then retest the breakout level from the downtrend line. The bears will have to sink it below $6.60 to be back in control.\n\nMaker price analysis\n\nMaker (MKR) turned down from the overhead resistance at $1,370 on Sept. 21, indicating that the bears are trying to defend the level.\n\nMKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA of $1,226 is the support to watch for the downside. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that lower levels are continuing to attract buyers. The bulls will then make one more attempt to drive MKR\u2019s price above the overhead resistance. If they can pull it off, the MKR/USDT pair could accelerate toward $1,759.\n\nConversely, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened. That could keep the pair range-bound between $980 and $1,370 for a few days.\n\nMKR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages on the 4-hour chart have flattened out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If buyers shove the price above $1,306, the MKR price could sprint toward $1,370.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down and breaks below $1,264, it will suggest that the selling pressure is increasing. That could clear the path for a further decline to $1,225. A slide below this support may tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nArbitrum price analysis\n\nArbitrum (ARB) is in a downtrend. The bears are selling on rallies to the 20-day EMA of $0.85, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground. This suggests that the bulls are trying to hold on to their positions as they anticipate a move higher.\n\nARB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe RSI has risen above 40, indicating that the momentum is gradually turning positive. If buyers kick the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the start of a sustained recovery. The ARB/USDT pair could first rally to the 50-day SMA of $0.95 and thereafter to $1.04.\n\nThe support on the downside is $0.80 and then $0.78. Sellers will have to drag ARB\u2019s price below this zone to make room for a retest of the support near $0.74. A break below this level will indicate the resumption of the downtrend.\n\nARB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the bears are selling the rallies to the downtrend line. The bears pulled the price below the moving averages but could not sink ARB below the immediate support at $0.81. This suggests that the bulls are trying to form a higher low.\n\nBuyers will again try to propel the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, Arbitrum\u2019s price is likely to start a strong recovery toward the psychological level of $1. Contrarily, a break below $0.81 can tug the ARB price to $0.78 and subsequently to $0.74.\n\nTheta Network price analysis\n\nTheta Network (THETA) soared above the 20-day EMA of $0.61 on Sept. 23, indicating that the bulls have absorbed the supply and are attempting a comeback.\n\nTHETA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears have pulled the price back below the 50-day SMA of $0.64, but the bulls are expected to defend the 20-day EMA. If THETA price turns up from the current level and climbs above the 50-day SMA, it will enhance the prospects of a retest of $0.70.\n\nThis is an important level to keep an eye on because if it is scaled, the THETA/USDT pair may reach $0.76. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the 20-day EMA. That opens the door for a potential retest of $0.57.\n\nTHETA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the bears are protecting the overhead resistance at $0.65. If buyers want to sustain the bullish momentum, they will have to drive THETA above $0.65. If they do that, the pair is likely to start a new up-move toward $0.70.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is the important support to watch for on the downside. If bears sink the price below this support, it will indicate that the bulls are closing their positions. The pair may then descend toward the $0.58 support.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOver the years, Bitcoin\u2019s network has been no stranger to long lines of transactions waiting to get confirmed, which forces fees to skyrocket and triggers alarms across Crypto Twitter and beyond. And the network is currently going through another bout of congestion, observed Bitcoin on-chain analyst Willy Woo.\n\n\u201cThe mempool is now at the highest point in the history of BTC since data was recorded,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJames Check, lead analyst for Glassnode, posted on Twitter earlier this week that there has been an explosion in blockspace demand due to inscriptions. These were popularized by Bitcoin Ordinals, and like NFTs, they allow users to \u201cinscribe\u201d things onto the blockchain\u2013whether that\u2019s images, texts, or audio.\n\nHe wrote that fees are not as high as they were during the Ordinal craze of early May, but the network has not been able to clear its mempool since.\n\nThink of a mempool as a blockchain\u2019s equivalent of a waiting room, with users sending Bitcoin in (or making inscriptions) and waiting for the transaction to get selected by a miner and inscribed into the public ledger.\n\nAt the time of writing, there are roughly 393,000 unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions.\n\nCheck went into detail explaining that inscriptions are providing what he calls baseload pressure, accounting for 50\u201360% of confirmed transactions and\u2014in essence\u2014the bloatedness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cInscriptions fill the void left by empty blockspace, and have done [so] for 5 months,\u201d he wrote, adding that these types of transactions are \u201csensitive to high fees, but willing to buy cheap blockspace.\u201d\n\nInscriptions means more transactions, bringing higher fees, which for some is welcome news.\n\nWoo, who told Decrypt he is currently paying $7.50 to move BTC, said he wants high transaction fees.\n\n\u201cOne day the network subsidy will run out and Bitcoin will be secured solely on the fee market,\u201d he said, alluding to the controversial Bitcoin security budget debate.\n\nWoo added that the Lightning Network, one of BItcoin\u2019s Layer-2 scaling solutions, will have to step up, but at these high fees, is compromised for smaller transactions.\n\n\u201cWe are really walking a middle path,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cToo cheap, and we make changes that bring back the capacity, then the network may be systemically compromised in decades ahead. Too expensive then the Lightning Network ceases to be decentralized and secure for everyday payments.\u201d\n\nThe on-chain analyst did point out that developers \u201cHave made huge jumps in improving the efficiency of the blockchain since the 2017 congestion when payment fees were very similar to whether they are right now.\u201d\n\nHow long today\u2019s congestion will last, however, is anyone's guess. That said, Woo is cautious.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cInscriptions came during the bear market, and fees \u201care already $7.50.\u201d He asks, \u201cWhat will happen during the bull market?\u201d\n\nWoo concludes with a somewhat ominous prediction, \u201cLightning may take up some of the load, but also we'll start to see some payment frauds as a result.\u201d"

As Bitcoin charts its own course, the question arises: is this a bullish or bearish signal?\n\nExplore More\u2026 pic.twitter.com/M5IzB6nux6 \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) September 21, 2023\n\nThough this looked positive, things could also turn nasty for BTC. Therefore, a look at BTC\u2019s metrics could help us better understand whether this development was bullish or bearish.\n\nThe NVT Signal is a key metric that uses a 90-day moving average of the daily transaction volume in the denominator. As per Glassnode Alerts\u2019 latest tweet, BTC\u2019s NVT Signal just reached a 6-month high of 1,529.771.

For example, BTC\u2019s exchange rate was declining, meaning that the coin was not under selling pressure.\n\nIts aSORP was green, suggesting that the market was in a fear phase. Additionally, Bitcoin\u2019s binary CDD revealed that the long-term holders\u2019 movements in the last seven days were lower than average.\n\nAre Bitcoin bulls already here?\n\nThanks to the aforementioned bullish metrics, BTC managed to stay above the $26,000 mark. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $26,650.84 with a market capitalization of more than $519 billion.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nThough the metrics were bullish, a look at BTC\u2019s daily chart suggested that investors can expect a few more slow-moving days. This seemed likely as both BTC\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) took a sideways path.\n\nNonetheless, the MACD displayed a clear bullish edge in the market, which could initiate a bull rally soon."

The coins are worth more than $25 billion at current market prices for BTC.\n\nAccording to Arkham, the exchange\u2019s holdings amount to almost 5% of all existing Bitcoin. Arkham said that Coinbase holds a total of 947,755 BTC. At the moment, Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply is around 19,493,537, according to coin information website CoinGecko.\n\nArkham has now identified $25B of Coinbase Bitcoin reserves (~1M BTC) on chain.\n\n\n\nThis makes Coinbase the largest Bitcoin entity in the world on Arkham, with almost 5% of all BTC in existence - about as much as Satoshi Nakamoto. pic.twitter.com/7sDOczS7WT \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) September 22, 2023\n\nFurthermore, Arkham also noted that it tagged and identified 36 million Bitcoin deposit and holding addresses used by the exchange. According to Arkham, Coinbase\u2019s largest cold wallet holds around 10,000 BTC. Based on the exchange\u2019s financial reports, the intelligence company believes that Coinbase has more Bitcoin that are not yet labeled and could not be identified.\n\nWhile Coinbase holds over $25 billion in BTC in its wallets, the exchange only owns around 10,000 of all the Bitcoin it holds, which is worth roughly $200 million, according to recent data.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining can help reduce up to 8% of global emissions: Report\n\nMeanwhile, community members expressed varying reactions to the news about the amount of Bitcoin the centralized exchange holds. Some believe it\u2019s a sign to withdraw their BTC from exchanges, warning holders not to wait until exchanges start to halt withdrawals. Others say that since there are legitimate concerns over cold wallets, there\u2019s no good way to store their assets.\n\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin ownership by companies, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy still owns the most BTC. In earnings results posted on Aug. 1, the firm\u2019s co-founder Michael Saylor declared that the company owns 152,800 BTC, worth over $4 billion at the time of writing.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market: Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "content": "Widely followed pseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa says one Dogecoin (DOGE) rival could make a bigger move to the upside.\n\nAltcoin Sherpa tells his 196,400 followers on the social media platform X that after breaking through a key resistance level, memecoin Pepe (PEPE) may not be done rallying.\n\n\u201cPEPE: nice move today, I didn\u2019t really see this one coming. The volume profile shows three significant resistance areas, with the first one getting broken now. I highly doubt this is a full reversal, but a bit more upside may be in store. Would be cautious with this one overall.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the next resistance level appears to be between the price range of $0.00000078 to $0.000000820.\n\nPepe is trading for $0.000000716 at time of writing, up 16.9% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext, the trader weighs in on Bitcoin (BTC) and says the market remains unclear as key exponential moving averages (EMAs) converge just above the crypto king\u2019s price, acting as resistance.\n\n\u201cBTC one-day thoughts: overall market structure hasn\u2019t changed much IMO (in my opinion). We\u2019re still either forming some sort of weird higher low OR consolidating for the next leg down. The cluster of one-day EMAs all acting as resistance for now, but no clear change.\u201d\n\nThe trader predicts Bitcoin will decline to finish out the year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t personally have a super strong opinion in regards to where price goes. Gut says we move up to $28,000 in the mid-term, but I don\u2019t really know. The last recent high established in mid-July was an equal high from before and not truly a higher high IMO.\n\nI think we\u2019re still in an overall chop fest similar to 2019, where we saw a big move up and we\u2019ll see a slow grind down for the rest of 2023. Probably slow grind down IMO and then we have some good times in December/January as always.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $26,595 at time of writing, up 0.1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader says he\u2019s keeping an eye on the AI-based altcoin Worldcoin (WLD). According to Altcoin Sherpa, WLD might be in a position to witness a price dip after a brief rally as it now trades close to a key resistance level.\n\n\u201cWLD: Total shitcoin, but I think that this one makes a lower high.

        "title": "Bitcoin miners double down on efficiency and renewable energy at the World Digital Mining Summit - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitmain rolled out its next-generation Antminer S21 and S21 Hydro ASIC miners at the World Digital Mining Summit (WDMS) in Hong Kong on Sept. 22, revealing the crucial performance stats the entire industry has been waiting for. The S21 has a hash rate of 200 terahashes per second (TH/s) and an efficiency of 17.5 joules per terahash (J/T), while the S21 hydro hashes at 335 TH/s and 16 J/T, which is notable given that until recently, most Bitcoin ASICS were operating above the 20 J/T level.\n\nWith electricity costs continuing to rise year-over-year and the Bitcoin halving projected to occur in April 2024, ASIC efficiency is quickly becoming the paramount focus of miners, and many are also pivoting toward folding in renewable energy sources as a core component of their operations.\n\nBitcoin miners focus on efficiency and renewable energy\n\nSustainable development in the mining industry was a core theme discussed in a majority of the panels at the WDMS. In the opening roundtable, team members from Terrawulf, Core Scientific, CleanSpark and Iris Energy shared their perspectives on how further integration of renewable energy sources will become a critical strategy to implement for many miners after the April 2024 Bitcoin supply halving.\n\nBitmain World Digital Mining Summit. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nAccording to Nazar Khan, Terrawulf\u2019s chief operating officer:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a significant transition going on in the supply side of the generation process; there\u2019s a concerted effort to decarbonize the entire supply stack, and so when we talk about Bitcoin miners consuming more renewable energy, that\u2019s part of a broader theme that\u2019s happening across the United States without Bitcoin mining as well. The role that we play is locating our Bitcoin mining loads in places where that\u2019s happening and how do we facilitate that decarbonization process.\u201c\n\nOne impact of the upcoming supply halving is that miners will maintain the same capital and operational costs, plus the need to pay down any revolving debts, while essentially seeing their block reward distribution cut in half.\n\nFor this reason, miners will either need to increase the percentage of their hash rate derived from sustainable energy sources or make efficiency adjustments to their ASIC fleet to maintain or increase their profitability.\n\nRegarding the rollout of the Antminer S21 and its potential impact on the mining industry, BMC founder Justin Kramer said:\n\n\u201cThe S21, if reliable, fairly priced and readily available \u2014 and yes, that\u2019s a lot of ifs with Bitmain\u2019s history \u2014 could revolutionize the crypto mining landscape with its efficiency. It is basically packing the power of two S19 100T miners into one unit. Despite this, the burgeoning aftermarket firmware market, coupled with hydro/immersion systems, give miners more tools to keep older generation miners, such as the S19, profitable also. Thus, while the S21 represents a notable advancement, it may not render sub 110 TH/s miners entirely obsolete.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about what else caught this eye from the S21 release, Kramer noted that:\n\n\u201cI like that Bitmain is rewarding environmentally friendly mining farms with better pricing and advanced delivery with their new Carbon Neutral Certificate. But, I\u2019ll add that, it was a little surprising when I noticed that both new S21 models offer 33% more hash rate (S21 200T versus 151T on S19j XP; S21 hydro is 335T versus the S19 XP Hydro at 257T). Is this a coincidence? I\u2019m doubtful, and it likely signals more of the same systematic model releases from Bitmain where a slight tweak to the firmware and maybe a few other items that are adjusted results in a moderate increase in hash rate and a brand-new miner.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is en route to becoming an ESG asset\n\nA theme of the past few years has been an increase in Bitcoin miners and BTC advocates pushing back against the assertion that Bitcoin mining is bad for the environment, and that the industry\u2019s reliance on carbon-based energy production accelerates emissions.\n\nCountering this perspective, Hong Kong Sustaintech Foundation professor in accounting and finance, Haitian Lu, bluntly announced that:\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is promoting renewable energy adoption in many areas.\u201d\n\nLu explained that \u201cover the years, Bitcoin mining has become more efficient and is also using cleaner energy. History tells us that human development from an agricultural society to industrialization to the future of a digitalized economy goes with every increasing energy consumption per capita. What makes the difference is human\u2019s ability to use renewable energy increases, thus achieving sustainable development.\u201d\n\nLike the perspectives shared by other panelists, Lu said that Bitcoin miners\u2019 participation in demand response agreements with power producers and distributors leads to energy grid efficiency, and they \u201cprovide an economic incentive for the development of renewable energy \u201cpromotion and development of renewable energy projects.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin mining tapping into stranded energy, encouraging the development of renewable energy projects and helping to balance electric grids, the efficiency advancements of next-generation ASICs like the Antminer S21 reduce miners\u2019 energy consumption while also allowing them to boost their profits."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past week, the crypto market displayed a sideways trend, influenced by various industry developments and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin started trading at the $26,000 mark and briefly surged above $27,000. However, it faced resistance around the $27,500 level, leading to a subsequent downward movement. Presently, BTC is trading at approximately $26,600. If BTC continues its decline, it may retest the support zone at $25,400. Despite experiencing a 60% decline from its all-time high, BTC has posted a 2.34% gain month-to-date and a remarkable 60% increase year-to-date.Additionally, this week the U.S. Federal Reserve convened for a meeting to discuss interest rate hikes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank would consider additional rate hikes if the economy continues to outperform expectations. The benchmark interest rate presently remains in the range of 5.25% to 5.50%. Concurrently, market participants are reacting to the U.S. benchmark 10-year note yields reaching 4.490%, the highest level since November 2007. These events have induced a bit of bearish sentiments in the markets.Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) has mirrored BTC's movements. ETH encountered bearish momentum below the $1,600 level. A breakthrough above the $1,620 resistance could propel its price toward $1,650, while a failure to clear immediate support may lead to a decline towards the $1,565 level.In an interesting turn of events, Germany's largest lender, Deutsche Bank, announced a collaboration with Swiss startup Taurus to establish digital asset custody and tokenization services, highlighting the growing involvement of traditional financial institutions in the crypto space.On a different note, Nomura, a prominent Japanese investment bank, introduced a Bitcoin-based fund catering to institutional investors. Meanwhile, Grayscale, a notable player in the crypto investment space, has submitted an application to the U.S. SEC for a new Ethereum Futures ETF, further demonstrating the continued evolution of the crypto market and its integration with traditional finance.Coming to the price action, among the top 100 cryptos by market cap, here are the best and worst-performing cryptos over the past week:As per prices on Friday.1.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCoinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, is holding onto $25 billion in Bitcoin reserves, an amount that rivals the holdings of Bitcoin\u2019s founder Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIn a post by Arkham Intelligence on Saturday, the company identified an estimated $25 billion in Bitcoin held in about 36 million wallets belonging to Coinbase and used for depositing and holding the tokens. The largest identified cold wallet holds about 10,000 Bitcoin, which is worth about $265 million as of this writing, according to Coingecko data.\n\nArkham's estimate is based only on the wallets identified as being connected to Coinbase, but the firm suggests that this amount is close to the estimated amount held by Bitcoin's founder.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"This [amount] makes Coinbase the largest Bitcoin entity in the world on Arkham, with almost 5% of all BTC in existence,\" the company wrote in a tweet.\n\nNakamato's exact identity remains unknown fifteen years after the Bitcoin white paper appeared on an online messenger board for cryptographers. Like the enigmatic creator's identity, the exact size of Nakamoto's Bitcoin holdings remains a mystery.\n\nBetween January and July 2009, Satoshi is thought to have mined more than 1 million BTC in total when Bitcoin's value was below the value of a penny. At today\u2019s value, this would equal more than $26 billion. If true, this would make Nakamoto one of the biggest crypto whales today\u2014but there has not been a definitive verification of his ownership of these wallets.\n\nTrading in Bitcoin and Bitcoin pairs comprises a significant portion of Coinbase\u2019s trading volume. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Coinbase said that trading in Bitcoin made up 40% of its total volumes, and about 39% in its transaction revenue.\n\nArkham estimates that the wallets it connected to Coinbase may be an incomplete figure based on the exchange\u2019s stated financials. In Coinbase\u2019s most recent 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it estimated that it held $60.7 billion in customer assets and liabilities in Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "BTC\u2019s market capitalization was over 49% and could hit 50% soon.\n\nBTC was trading at around $26,500 with a less than 1% price decline.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] earned its nickname \u201cking coin\u201d for a good reason, and its dominance in the realm of cryptocurrencies was a key factor. New data indicated that its dominance could be on the verge of a second increase this year.\n\nRead Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2023-25\n\nBitcoin dominance to hit 50%\n\nBased on recent data from IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin has witnessed a rise in its dominance over the past week. According to the data provided, BTC dominance was approaching the 50% mark.\n\nThis indicates that its market capitalization is edging closer to comprising half of the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization. Furthermore, if this milestone is reached, it would mark the second time this has occurred within the year.\n\nCurrent Bitcoin market capitalization dominance\n\nBased on data from CoinMarketCap, the current cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at over $1 trillion at the time of writing. Additionally, CoinMarketCap data revealed that Bitcoin currently held a dominance of 49.1% within the cryptocurrency market cap, making it the dominant player.\n\nEthereum held the second-highest market cap, with a dominance of 18.2% as of this writing. This data implied that, excluding Bitcoin, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization amounted to slightly over $536.3 billion.\n\nAdditionally, this highlighted why price movements in Bitcoin often have a significant impact on the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nFurthermore, a historical analysis of dominance charts revealed that Bitcoin\u2019s dominance began to decline towards the end of 2021. Prior to that, it held over 60% of the market.\n\nHowever, the launch and acceptance of other cryptocurrencies contributed to the erosion of Bitcoin\u2019s dominance. As of the current moment, its market capitalization still stands at approximately $518 billion.\n\nAdditionally, its dominance was affected by declines in its price.\n\nBTC\u2019s current price trend\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was experiencing a slight loss, extending a trend from the previous trading session as observed in its daily timeframe.\n\n\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today\n\nNotably, a consistent pattern of weekend losses had emerged over the past three weeks. BTC was trading at approximately $26,590, reflecting a decline of less than 1%.\n\nFurthermore, it was currently hovering around the neutral line on its Relative Strength Index (RSI). This indicated that its bullish momentum was weakening and could transition to a bear trend if the price decline continued."

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin in Dubai - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Dubai is a magnificent city to live and work in. But how can someone buy Bitcoin in Dubai? Is it legal to buy Bitcoin in Dubai? Is Dubai crypto-friendly?\n\nHere\u2019s a quick guide with the answers. The great news is that, yes, buying Bitcoin (BTC) in the United Arab Emirates is permitted, and the country is actually one of the most welcoming to cryptocurrency exchanges and investors.\n\nIs Dubai crypto-friendly?\n\nThe thriving metropolis of Dubai in the UAE has long been deemed a crypto-friendly city. Some describe the UAE as the most crypto-friendly country.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there is zero tax to pay on cryptocurrency trading in the UAE, as well as zero income or capital gains tax. This combination has made the Middle Eastern country massively attractive to cryptocurrency and blockchain companies and the users of these technologies. There are many UAE crypto traders and plenty of crypto investment options in the UAE.\n\nBut is it legal to buy Bitcoin in Dubai? Dubai and the UAE have some regulations on cryptocurrencies, including policies to protect investors. Cryptocurrencies are not licensed or recognized as legal tender; however, there are no laws against buying Bitcoin in the UAE or owning or trading Bitcoin or other crypto.\n\nHow to buy cryptocurrency in Dubai\n\nBuying Bitcoin in Dubai and anywhere in the UAE is quite straightforward; it starts with choosing a crypto exchange, registering and creating an account, and then adding the funds needed to buy the cryptocurrency of choice.\n\nBitcoin is available on any exchange, and other leading cryptocurrencies are available on most major exchanges. Investors who plan to hold on to Bitcoin usually want to move their Bitcoin away from an exchange into a Bitcoin wallet or to more secure Bitcoin storage like a hardware wallet. Let\u2019s look at the steps to buying Bitcoin in the United Arab Emirates:\n\n1. Choose an exchange\n\nThe first priority when choosing an exchange is security; crypto buyers should always research the exchange and check online reviews, then review the coins, the exchange lists and the fees.\n\n2. Register\n\nRegistering with an exchange starts with an email, a password and any other security authentication available. Cryptocurrency exchange users should always make full use of any additional security options. New exchange users will usually need to provide the exchange with an image of a piece of photo ID to complete its Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.\n\n3. Fund and buy\n\nOnce an account has been created, funds can be added from fiat accounts. After that, it\u2019s possible to buy BTC with UAE dirhams easily this way or to select another trading pair.\n\nWhich crypto exchanges operate in Dubai and the UAE?\n\nThe intriguing thing is that there are many leading exchanges that operate in the UAE; investors can pick from the most well-known, the best-reviewed, those thought of as the safest, and those with the highest availability of leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nSome of the crypto exchanges and Bitcoin trading platforms in Dubai and the UAE are eToro, OKX, HTX (formerly Huobi) and Binance. Bitcoin brokers in the UAE, such as Rain, OKX, Uphold, Bybit and Binance, are regulated by the UAE Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) or the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).\n\nHow to choose Bitcoin wallets in Dubai\n\nJust like Bitcoin trading platforms in Dubai, there are lots of options for Bitcoin wallets in Dubai to store crypto safely. The first step is to choose a Bitcoin wallet suitable for investor plans or behavior.\n\nOnline wallets or wallet applications aren\u2019t as safe as hardware wallets, but they can be more suitable for investors planning to move their cryptocurrency holdings or use them on a regular basis. Hot wallets to choose from include Trust Wallet or Electrum.\n\nMore valuable Bitcoin holdings or funds left idle for some time are best stored in safer hardware wallets, such as Trezor or Ledger Nano.\n\nCan you buy Bitcoin in Dubai with cash?\n\nIt\u2019s possible to buy Bitcoin in Dubai with cash straight from an account or by using a credit card. After an account has been set up with an exchange, the next step is to add fiat money funds to the account and then go on to purchase Bitcoin.\n\nDoes Dubai have Bitcoin ATMs?\n\nThe UAE is so welcoming to crypto that it is one of the countries to have Bitcoin ATMs, and Dubai\u2019s first Bitcoin ATM was installed at the five-star Rixos Premium Dubai Hotel in 2019. At the kiosk, visitors can insert cash and buy Bitcoin instantly.\n\nIs buying Bitcoin via P2P in Dubai common?\n\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchanges allow users to trade Bitcoin directly with one another, unlike centralized or decentralized exchanges. On a P2P exchange, it\u2019s possible to look at a seller\u2019s list of assets for sale and choose accordingly. Buyers and sellers agree on the price of the cryptocurrency for sale before the sale is made.\n\nP2P exchanges can be more common in countries with greater restrictions on cryptocurrency exchanges; in Dubai, that\u2019s not the case. The major exchanges operating in Dubai often have P2P functionality as well as standard trading options, which provides the best of both worlds. The exchanges offering P2P trading in Dubai include Binance, Paxful, OKX, HTX, Bybit and KuCoin.\n\nAre there crypto-friendly banks in the UAE?\n\nIt is interesting to know how banks in Dubai and the UAE view cryptocurrencies and crypto users. The UAE doesn\u2019t fail the crypto entrepreneur, and there are a number of crypto-friendly banks in the UAE that will allow crypto businesses to open and use fiat accounts.\n\nFirst Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) has no policies restricting its customers from buying and selling crypto. Although it doesn\u2019t offer crypto trading, it\u2019s possible to link an FAB account with a crypto exchange to fund Bitcoin purchases. FAB also has future plans to leverage Web3 and digital assets for its users.\n\nExercise caution while dealing with cryptocurrencies\n\nIt is fortunate for Dubai residents to have access to a vibrant financial environment that enables them to engage with the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that the value of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies is extremely volatile and subject to significant price swings in either direction. Therefore, before entering the cryptocurrency market, careful research and knowledge of the risks involved are crucial."

        "title": "This is how centralized Bitcoin mining has become over the years \u2013 Report - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "In the past years, it has been possible to observe a gradual, but constant trend of fewer Bitcoin (BTC) mining pools dominating the majority of the global network hashrate and block discovery. In this report, Finbold uses a data-based approach to analyze the decentralization state of the leading cryptocurrency network and explains why it is important.\n\nGoing from an unknown number of Bitcoin miners having the majority of its hashrate since the first block was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, to four mining pools having mined over 59% of all blocks in the last three years, and only two of these institutions dominating over 52% of the new BTC distribution in the last three months.\n\nBitcoin mining decentralization state\n\nThis data was gathered from mempool.space pools ranking, which analyses the hashrate dominance by looking at who was responsible for each block ever added to the Bitcoin blockchain in each timeframe. Consequently receiving the reward in BTC through the creation of new coins \u2014 until the maximum limit of 21 million is achieved in the next 120 years (approximately).\n\nAll-time Bitcoin blocks discovery\n\nAt the time of publication, a total of 808987 Bitcoin blocks were mined and added to the blockchain. Resulting in a total of 19,493,656 BTC being distributed to each of the lucky miners (or mining pools) that discovered each of these blocks by providing Proof of Work (PoW) through hash calculations.\n\nInterestingly, from these 808,987 blocks, 220,716 (27.29%) were mined by unknown entities \u2014 mostly in the early days of the network, probably by individual and domestic miners, or yet unidentified mining companies.\n\nBitcoin mining all-time pools ranking. Source: mempool.space\n\n3-year Bitcoin global hashrate decentralization\n\nHowever, the scenario starts to change as Bitcoin becomes more recognized and the industry matures. Bitcoin miners \u2014 looking for more predictability in a highly competitive \u2018winner takes all\u2019 activity \u2014 started to unite forces (or hashrates) in mining pools. Effectively increasing their chance to mine a valid block and share the block reward.\n\nThis drastically changed the network\u2019s decentralization state as seen in the last 3 years\u2019 results, with only four pools providing over 59% of the global hashrate:\n\nFoundry USA (17.36%)\n\nAntPool (16.39%)\n\nF2Pool (15%)\n\nBinance Pool (10.36%)\n\nBitcoin mining 3-year (3Y) pools ranking. Source: mempool.space\n\n3-month BTC new supply distribution\n\nNotably, the trend continues as time goes by. Bitcoin domestic mining is not feasible anymore, smaller companies are not able to survive while operating underwater, and the remaining survivors get more concentrated in fewer pools for even higher revenue predictability.\n\nIn the last three months, only two mining pools received more than half of all the Bitcoin supply distribution which is set as 6.25 BTC per mined block \u2014 that happens on average every 10 minutes, for around 900 BTC/day.\n\nFoundry USA received around 24,831.25 BTC for mining 3,973 blocks (29.66%), while AntPool received around 19,018.75 BTC for mining 3,043 blocks (22.72%). This results in a total of 43,850 BTC accrued by these pools in the last 90 days, equal to $1.16 billion considering Bitcoin is priced at $26.500 by press time.\n\nBitcoin mining 3-month (3M) pools ranking. Source: mempool.space\n\nWhy is Bitcoin PoW decentralization important?\n\nProof of Work decentralization is important from both a financial and technical security point of view.\n\nA more decentralized Bitcoin distribution helps avoid market price manipulation, which can happen when fewer entities hold a larger share of the supply or exchanged volume. It also diminishes the effect of a single entity sell-off, as seen recently by F2Pool \u2014 currently the third largest mining pool.\n\nBitcoin: Miner reserve \u2013 F2Pool. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nMoreover, a more decentralized network also means that it is harder for a malicious entity to take over the consensus, which could, theoretically, allow for double spending through a 51% attack \u2014 when someone spends the same coin twice, like using a fake US dollar.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin mining pools function with the collaborative work of multiple mining companies or individual miners, these contributors are only providing work through hash calculations. It is the pool coordinator who adds transactions to the block template, signs and broadcasts the block to the network, and receives the block reward to be distributed later among the miners.\n\nAll things considered, the more decentralized cryptocurrencies\u2019 networks are, the more secure and valuable they can become long-term."
