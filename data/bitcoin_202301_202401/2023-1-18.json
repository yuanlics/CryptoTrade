        "title": "Peter Thiel's fund wound down 8-year bitcoin bet before market crash - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nFounders Fund, the venture capital firm co-founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, closed almost all of its eight-year bet on cryptocurrencies shortly before the market began to crash last year, generating about $1.8bn in returns.\n\nThe San Francisco-based fund made its first investment in bitcoin in early 2014 and went on to invest large sums in crypto. About two-thirds of its overall investment was used to buy bitcoin, said people close to the fund.\n\nFounders Fund sold out of the vast majority of its entire cryptocurrency portfolio by the end of March 2022 \u2014 before the digital assets market became swept up in a crisis in May last year, said one of the people close to the fund.\n\nThe fund currently has no significant exposure to cryptocurrencies, the people said. The winding-down of its crypto bet has not previously been reported. Founders Fund declined to comment.\n\nThiel, a big backer of Republican candidates and a supporter of former US president Donald Trump, was one of the earliest mainstream investors to buy large sums of bitcoin and has subsequently been loudly bullish on the digital currency.\n\nIn April 2022, about the same time that Founders Fund sold out of most of its cryptocurrency holdings, Thiel said he was optimistic about the future of bitcoin. He told a cryptocurrency conference in Miami that \u201cwe\u2019re at the end of the fiat money regime\u201d and suggested its price \u2014 which was then trading at about $44,000 \u2014 could increase by a factor of 100.\n\nThiel said JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon and BlackRock boss Larry Fink \u201cneed to be allocating some of their money to bitcoin\u201d, adding: \u201cWe need to push back on them.\u201d\n\nThe price of bitcoin, which was launched in 2009, surged dramatically from roughly $750 in 2014 to an all-time high of more than $65,000 by November 2021. However, its price has been volatile in recent years, with several big collapses in value, including a drop to about $15,500 in November last year, a two-year low.\n\nThe digital assets market has been rocked by a crisis since May last year, forcing high-profile crypto companies such as Terraform Labs, Celsius, Voyager and Three Arrows Capital into bankruptcy.\n\nMarket sentiment towards crypto was damaged further in November when FTX, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, shut down owing creditors more than $3bn, and its co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was charged with multiple fraud charges.\n\nBy December, bitcoin had lost about three-quarters of its value from its peak and more than $2tn had been wiped off the value of the global crypto market.\n\nSeveral blue-chip Silicon Valley investors have piled into digital currencies in recent years, although most have focused their investments on equity stakes in crypto businesses rather than buying cryptocurrencies directly.\n\nSome exceptions to this include A16z crypto \u2014 the crypto arm of venture firm Andreessen Horowitz \u2014 which raised a $4.5bn fund last year and also invests directly in crypto coins and tokens.\n\nSimilarly, Paradigm, a crypto venture firm founded in 2018 by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang, raised a $2.5bn fund in late 2021.\n\nBut many large financial institutions stayed away from cryptocurrencies over fears about cyber security and their links to money laundering and drug trafficking. In 2017, JPMorgan\u2019s Dimon called bitcoin a \u201cfraud\u201d.\n\nFounders Fund\u2019s shift on crypto, which had been one of its core positions, was one of about nine big exits the venture fund made between 2020 and the end of last year that allowed it to return roughly $13bn to investors.\n\nOther exits also included the initial public offerings of companies it had backed since their early fundraisings, such as Airbnb and Palantir, the data analytics group that Thiel co-founded.\n\nThiel co-founded PayPal in 1998 and went on to become one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most successful investors, including being the first venture capitalist to back Facebook.\n\nFounders Fund has more than $11bn under management, including $5bn of capital raised across two funds last year, and has taken stakes in more than 100 companies, such as Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, ride-hailing app Lyft and defence tech group Anduril.\n\nThe fund is in talks to take an equity stake in OpenAI, the developer behind chatbot ChatGPT, at a valuation of $29bn."

        "title": "Bitcoin Rallies to Recoup Losses Since FTX Collapse (Published 2023) - The New York Times",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency bulls are extending one of the most unlikely rallies of the year so far, pushing Bitcoin above $21,000 for a second day. That means the digital currency has now recouped all its losses since the spectacular collapse of FTX in November.\n\nThe rising tide has lifted most crypto boats, the DealBook newsletter reports. Even some beaten-down tokens \u2014 including FTT, the in-house token of the bankrupt exchange FTX \u2014 have rebounded as investors bet the Federal Reserve will slow its interest rate increases, leading to a broad rally of risky assets. Shares in Coinbase, the publicly traded crypto exchange that has been laying off workers and cutting costs, gained at the market open in New York; it\u2019s up more than 30 percent over the past week.\n\nBut crypto analysts are divided on whether the rally is sustainable; by Wednesday afternoon, Bitcoin had fallen back below $21,000. Skeptics argue that the fundamentals for a long-term rise are missing, making the recent jump a risky bet for investors.\n\nThe crypto rally comes as lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm advising on FTX\u2019s multibillion-dollar bankruptcy, disclosed that the company\u2019s assets were worth roughly $5.5 billion, including $1.7 billion in cash and $3.5 billion in crypto assets. That makes this wider rally significant for FTX creditors \u2014 if it lasts."

        "content": "Despite the ongoing Crypto Winter, Bitcoin supporters are certain that the future for the fledgling industry is bright. And so far this year, they\u2019ve had reason to celebrate. Bitcoin\u2019s price has jumped more than 25% in the past few weeks alone after a dismal 2022. But JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon still isn\u2019t a believer. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, Dimon bashed cryptocurrencies as a distraction.\n\n\u201cI think all that\u2019s been a waste of time and why you guys waste any breath on it is totally beyond me,\u201d he told CNBC. \u201cBitcoin itself is a hyped up fraud. It\u2019s a pet rock.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Dimon has expressed his doubts about cryptocurrencies\u2014or used a \u201cpet rock\u201d analogy to describe digital assets. The CEO has described Bitcoin a \u201cfraud\u201d since 2017; and after the blow-up of what was once the world\u2019s second largest crypto exchange FTX late last year, he argued the entire industry was a \u201ccomplete sideshow.\u201d\n\nCNBC anchor Joe Kernen pushed back on Dimon\u2019s claims that Bitcoin is a fraud on Thursday, arguing the cryptocurrency is a \u201cstore of value\u201d that is \u201cimmutable\u201d and \u201cscarce,\u201d noting its protocol indicates that there will only ever be 21 million coins.\n\n\u201cTotally untrue. How do you know it\u2019s gonna stop at 21 million? Maybe it\u2019s going to get to 21 million and Satoshi\u2019s picture is going to come up and laugh at you all,\u201d Dimon quipped, referencing the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto that was used by Bitcoin\u2019s anonymous creator, or creators.\n\nBut while Dimon doesn\u2019t believe in cryptocurrencies, when it comes to the blockchain technology that they\u2019re built on, he has a much more positive outlook.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cBlockchain is a technology ledger system that we use to move information. We\u2019ve used it to do overnight repo, intraday repo, we\u2019ve used it to move money, right? So that\u2019s a technology ledger that we think will be deployable.\u201d\n\nDimon and JPMorgan have leaned into blockchain technology since 2017, when the bank was one of 86 firms that helped create an open-source blockchain initiative called The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. And as Dimon mentioned above, the company uses its own cryptocurrency, the JPM Coin, to carry out intraday repurchase agreements. But on Thursday, Dimon noted that the financial industry has been talking about using blockchain technology for 12 years and, to this point, he said \u201cvery little has been done.\u201d"

The license plate says \"Kuna\" on it, which is the name of a Ukrainian cryptocurrency exchange. Michael Chobanian, the founder of Kuna, confirmed that the car belongs to him.\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 The mystery of the orange bitcoin car, that was first spotted by CNBC on Monday at the Alpine resort of Davos, Switzerland, has been solved and the owner is not impressed with its critics.\n\nThe Mercedes, which sports a bitcoin logo in place of the car's iconic badge and the words \"in crypto we trust\" across the wheels, was parked outside the Blockchain Hub, a space run by Casper Labs along the Davos Promenade.\n\nThe Promenade is the main street in Davos where companies and governments have taken over shops and cafes for this week's World Economic Forum \u2014 an annual gathering of business leaders, celebs and global policymakers.\n\nLast year, crypto firms from all walks of life took over the place. But since the crypto market slide of 2022, there are far fewer crypto firms with flashy store fronts at Davos.\n\nCNBC asked people in the vicinity on Monday whose car it is but nobody saw who parked it. Two crypto executives who spoke to CNBC did not welcome the presence of the car, given the near $1.4 trillion wipeout of the market last year and the excesses of the industry are under scrutiny.\n\nOne exec said that the presence of such a car was not helpful for the industry's reputation which took a hit last year.\n\nThe license plate had \"Kuna\" printed on it, which is the name of a Ukrainian cryptocurrency exchange."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said bitcoin is a fraud, repeating his criticism of the world's largest cryptocurrency amid the market's struggles after the FTX collapse. The banking exec also delivered an ominous warning for the world economy as it nears the one-year mark since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDimon has been a loud skeptic of crypto, blasting the industry as a \"complete sideshow\" after the collapse of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried's failed crypto exchange. That's because crypto tokens are often tied to criminal activity, Dimon said, though his views of the underlying blockchain technology are more favorable.\n\n\"I think all that is a waste of time, and why you guys waste any breath on it is beyond me,\" Dimon said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. \"Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud. It's a pet rock,\" he said.\n\nDimon hit back at claims that tokens like bitcoin have built in scarcity that prevents it from being devalued, with just 21 million of the coins in existence. Those arguments are \"totally untrue,\" Dimon said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"How do you know it's going to stop at 21 million? Everyone says that. Well maybe it's going to get to 21 million and Satoshi's picture is going to come up and laugh at you all,\" he added.\n\nDimon also gave a bearish prediction for the US economy this year, with inflation still well-above the Fed's 2% target and interest rates expected to rise past 5%, which market commentators have warned could spark a recession. He added that one of the biggest problems facing the global economy is the war between Russia and Ukraine, a conflict that's disrupted supply chains and spiked energy prices around the world.\n\n\"The real issue for the world is Russia, war, Ukraine, energy, trade, and that is serious. And that's still out there. Hopefully it will mitigate and go away, but it may not,\" he said. \"The only thing that matters for the future of the world is how this thing plays out.\"\n\nAs for signs of bullishness investors have been showing since the start of the year, Dimon isn't convinced a lasting rally is here. \"Markets have always been wrong,\" Dimon warned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDimon previously forecasted a mild recession to hit the US this year and stocks to drop 20%, though he said his team was preparing for a more severe downturn. He added that the Fed would likely need to continue its aggressive policy to sufficiently rein in inflation, predicting interest rates would push past 6%."

        "content": "In his latest blog post released on Jan. 19, Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of the BitMEX exchange, predicted a \u201cglobal financial meltdown\u201d thanks to future United States economic woes.\n\nHayes: Crypto will \u201cget smoked\u201d in Fed pivot\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current rally should likely not be taken as the start of a new bull run, Hayes says in the fresh treatise on U.S. macroeconomic policy, warning that crypto assets will \u201cget smoked\u201d when Federal Reserve policy flips from restrictive to liberal.\n\nWith U.S. inflation easing, the Fed is the focus of practically every crypto analyst this year as they estimate the likelihood of a policy \u201cpivot\u201d away from quantitative tightening (QT) and interest rate hikes to flat and then decreasing rates, and potentially even quantitative easing (QE).\n\nThis essentially involves a move away from draining the economy of liquidity to injecting it back in, and while that practice led to new all-time highs for Bitcoin beginning in 2020, the same phenomenon would not be plain sailing next time around, Hayes believes.\n\n\u201cIf a removal of half a trillion dollars in 2022 created the worst bond and stock performance in a few hundred years, imagine what will happen if double that amount is removed in 2023,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThe reaction of the markets when money is injected vs. withdrawn is not symmetrical \u2014 and as such, I expect that the law of unintended consequences will bite the Fed in the ass as it continues to withdraw liquidity.\u201d\n\nAs such, rather than a smooth transition away from QT, Hayes is betting on extreme circumstances forcing the Fed to act.\n\n\u201cSome part of the US credit market breaks, which leads to a financial meltdown across a broad swath of financial assets,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cIn a response similar to the action it took in March 2020, the Fed calls an emergency press conference and stops QT, cuts rates significantly and recommences Quantitative Easing (QE) by purchasing bonds once more.\u201d\n\nThis in turn means \u201crisky asset prices crater.\u201d\n\n\u201cBonds, equities, and every crypto under the sun all get smoked as the glue that holds together the global USD-based financial system dissolves,\u201d the blog post continues.\n\nCurrent estimates, as shown by CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, overwhelmingly favor the Fed lowering the pace of rate hikes at its next decision on Feb. 1.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart. Source: CME Group\n\nPlanning a March 2020 rerun\n\nHayes is far from alone in being suspicious of Bitcoin (BTC) being a firm \u201cbuy\u201d at present after two weeks of near-vertical price growth.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin sees new 4-month high as US PPI, retail data post \u2018big misses\u2019\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, various commentators wager that new macro lows will still appear, with BTC/USD taking out its floor from the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nThose taking a leap of faith and piling in now thus face serious risk before reward.\n\n\u201cThis scenario is less ideal because it would mean that everyone who is buying risky assets now would be in store for massive drawdowns in performance. 2023 could be just as bad as 2022 until the Fed pivots,\u201d Hayes wrote, nonetheless calling that scenario his \u201cbase case.\u201d\n\nIf that means a retest of the 2022 lows, the area between $15,000 and $16,000 will be a key zone of interest going forward.\n\n\u201cI will know that the market has probably bottomed, because the crash that happens when the system temporarily breaks will either hold the previous $15,800 lows, or it won\u2019t,\u201d the blog post concludes.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter what level is ultimately reached on the down draft because I know the Fed will subsequently move to print money and avert another financial collapse, which will in turn mark the local bottom of all risky assets. And then I get another setup similar to March 2020, which requires me to back up the truck and purchase crypto with two hands and a shovel.\u201d\n\nBitcoin faces a drop to $15,000 \u201cor lower\u201d as part of the mass risk asset capitulation, Hayes says.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour candle chart (Bitstamp).

        "content": "One month before billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel raved about the advantages of Bitcoin during a speech at a Miami conference, his VC firm Founders Fund had already offloaded an eight-year bet on cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile crypto was once one of its core positions, by March 2022, the firm had generated $1.8 billion from selling off the vast majority of its crypto holdings, the Financial Times reported, citing a person close to the fund. Two-thirds of its crypto investment consisted of Bitcoin, according to the FT.\n\nThe selloff was timely, and protected the firm from the collapse in Bitcoin\u2019s price later that year that would take it to about $15,599 last November, its lowest price in two years.\n\nBut in April at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami, Thiel made no mention of his fund\u2019s massive crypto selloff. He also didn\u2019t waver in his support for Bitcoin. During a speech, he said, \u201cWe are at the end of the fiat money regime,\u201d and added that Bitcoin was undervalued but \u201chas every potential to replace gold.\u201d\n\nFounders Fund declined to comment to Reuters.\n\nThe price of almost all cryptocurrencies plummeted last year as the industry experienced the bankruptcies of some of its most high-profile companies, including the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto exchange FTX. The collapse of FTX and the criminal charges handed down to former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried in particular have caused damage to several other companies and have drawn outsized attention from regulators.\n\nSan Francisco-based Founders Fund first bought into Bitcoin in 2014 when it traded for under $1,000 and increased its holdings over the next eight years. Thiel was also one of the first well known investors to put money into Bitcoin.\n\nIn part, because of its Bitcoin selloff, along with exits from long-held companies like Airbnb and the Thiel-cofounded data analytics group Palantir, Founders Fund returned about $13 billion to investors between 2020 and the end of last year, according to the FT. The company has more than $11 billion under management."

        "title": "Bitcoin surges as investors return to riskier assets - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe price of bitcoin has surged nearly 30 per cent against the dollar in January, raising hopes among its faithful followers that the crypto market is emerging from the credit crisis that gripped it for much of last year.\n\nThe token, the most actively traded in the industry, has soared to more than $21,000 in the past week, breaking out of the tight range around $17,000 upon which it had settled following the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange in November.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has joined traditional financial assets such as stocks and bonds in rallying this year as investors become increasingly confident that the US Federal Reserve\u2019s policy of rapid rates rises to combat inflation is beginning to moderate. Last week, the US consumer price index posted an inflation rate of 6.5 per cent in December, the sixth consecutive month of decline.\n\n\n\nAlthough bitcoin enthusiasts argue the token can be a hedge against inflation, in the past year it has often fluctuated in line with shifts in consumer prices and interest rate expectations. The price began to tumble from its record high of nearly $70,000 in November 2021 when investors realised inflation was soaring.\n\n\u201cThe overall rally across most asset classes year to date due to hopes of a \u2018soft landing\u2019 for the US economy is boosting sentiment in crypto,\u201d said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, JPMorgan managing director focused on alternatives and digital assets.\n\nHe added that a weakening dollar also helped as it boosted the price of commodities such as gold, in turn helping to \u201creprice bitcoin as a substitute asset class\u201d.\n\nThe optimism has spread to other crypto-related assets. Ether, the second most traded cryptocurrency, has risen 31 per cent this month to more than $1,575, according to Refinitiv data. The token is widely used as a building block for ambitious crypto projects because it allows programmers to code functions to automatically buy and sell assets.\n\nOverall, the market value of the top 500 crypto tokens has risen back to $1tn from $830bn at the end of last year. It remains well off its November 2021 peak above $3.2tn, according to data from the Financial Times Digital Assets Dashboard.\n\n\u201cIf inflation is now retreating, pressure on the Fed and other central banks to raise rates aggressively will be reduced, enabling a gentle shift back to more \u2018risk-on\u2019 strategies,\u201d said Edmond Goh, head of trading at B2C2, a crypto market maker.\n\nHowever, confidence in crypto markets remains fragile, in part because investors are wary of further sudden shocks after the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX.\n\n\u201cSome upside volatility was due to come eventually and does not mean that this move upwards will be sustainable,\u201d said David Moreno Darocas, research lead at data provider CryptoCompare.\n\nThe fate of Genesis, one of the biggest lenders in the crypto market, in particular is uncertain. It halted customer withdrawals at its lending unit in November after FTX\u2019s failure, blaming \u201cunprecedented market turmoil\u201d and owes its creditors more than $3bn. Its parent, crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group, is trying to raise capital and avoid the bankruptcy of Genesis.\n\nOther bellwether names, including crypto-focused bank Silvergate and crypto exchanges Coinbase and Crypto.com, said they would extensively cut headcount.\n\nResearch provider Kaiko noted that prices rallied last week in part because traders who were betting on bitcoin to fall were caught in a short squeeze, pushing prices higher.\n\nIt also pointed out that market liquidity, or the ability to easily buy and sell assets at prevailing market prices, remained very weak. Nearly 90 per cent of bitcoin trades are conducted using a stablecoin, tokens intended to track real-world currencies and maintain a steady value, it said.\n\nLiquidity for both bitcoin and ether, as measured by the number of offers to buy and sell the tokens within 2 per cent of their price against the stablecoin Tether, had fallen by a fifth since early January to levels seen in the aftermath of the FTX fallout, Kaiko found.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is unclear why liquidity temporarily recovered but failed to stick around, especially over the past few days, which has seen the highest trade volumes since early November,\u201d it said.\n\nBut some see another possible market shakeout as the last squeeze of a market that has been caught in a whirlwind since the sudden failure of the TerraUSD stablecoin last May.\n\n\u201cIn my view, Genesis is the last domino to wobble since this sorry contagion crisis began with Terra months ago,\u201d said Ian Taylor, board adviser at CryptoUK, a British crypto lobby group. \u201cEven if Genesis files for bankruptcy, it\u2019s kind of priced in.\u201d"

        "title": "Crypto miner explains how Bitcoin mining stabilizes grids - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "2022 was \u201cthe perfect storm\u201d for Bitcoin (BTC) miners, according to Jaime Leverton, CEO of Hut8 Mining \u2014 one of the largest crypto miners and digital asset experts in the space.\n\nLeverton sat down with Gareth Jenkinson, senior reporter at Cointelegraph, in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Topics included were the 2022 bear market, Web3 diversification, and crucially, Bitcoin\u2019s growing positive impact on the environment and broader economy. Leverton shared that 2022 was a turbulent year for miners:\n\n\u201cObviously depressed Bitcoin prices, global hash rate continues to hit all-time highs, and then an energy crisis is thrown in the mix. So, it\u2019s certainly been a challenging time within the mining industry in particular.\u201d\n\nBitcoin hash rate, the ease at which miners can find a new block on the Bitcoin time chain and receive the block reward, has climbed higher in recent months. That\u2019s despite Bitcoin\u2019s price bobbing below $20,000. Mining profitability plunged as the hash difficulty surged. As a result, there were several Bitcoin and crypto miner casualties throughout 2022.\n\nHut 8 Bitcoin Mining Corp since Jan 2018. Source: Bitcointreasuries.net\n\nLeverton explained that a diversified strategy coupled with a successful mergers-and-acquisitions plan helped stave off insolvency risks for Hut 8.\n\nThe group recently spun up a \u201cBitcoin and mining repair facility for customers across Canada and Northern Europe.\u201d Meanwhile, a merger led to the purchase of \u201cfive enterprise-grade data centers and the associated business.\u201d Leverton highlighted that this move attempts to fill a gap in the market for digital infrastructure providers in the Web3 space:\n\n\u201cThey tend to be really dependent on the traditional Web2 hyperscalers as they try to build out these decentralized platforms. And obviously, when you\u2019re building a decentralized network, you don\u2019t want to do that in centralized infrastructure.\u201d\n\nWeb3, once a buzzword in the crypto space, has since become a hotly tipped trend for 2023, attracting 10-figure-plus investments from Hong Kong to Abu Dhabi. The entrance of Hut 8 into Web3 could usher more Bitcoin-only companies to consider opportunities in the Web3 space.\n\nHut 8 Mining Corp's holdings. Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net\n\nThe interview concluded with an astute discussion of Bitcoin mining and its role in protecting the environment. Leverton is a founding member of the Bitcoin Mining Council, a group engaged in dispelling the misinformation surrounding Bitcoin mining and seeking to \u201ctackle some of the misinformation that was coming out around Bitcoin\u2019s energy use, the sources of energy.\u201d\n\nLeverton explained that Bitcoin\u2019s transparency could in fact be its Achilles\u2019 heel:\n\n\u201cPart of the challenge we have is Bitcoin\u2019s energy use is so transparent \u2014 unlike every other industry in the world, where their energy consumption is opaque. With respect to Bitcoin mining, you can see the energy produced because, essentially, Bitcoin is digitized\u201d\n\nIn contrast, it is a Sisyphean task to quantify the entire energy output of banking or traditional finance, although it hasn\u2019t stopped some Bitcoin advocates from trying. In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, cryptographer Michel Khazzaka estimated that Bitcoin uses at least 56x less energy than banking.\n\nRelated: Seven times Bitcoin miners made the world a better place\n\nLeverton explained that there could be a disconnect between Bitcoin mining and its positive impact on both the environment and the economy. \u201cIt starts with education,\u201d she explained. A native Canadian, Leverton teed up an example of how Bitcoin mining creates jobs, stimulates the economy and even provides tax receipts in a small city in Alberta:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re their largest energy customer, their largest taxpayer, and a key provider of tech, labor and, in some cases, we also want to talk about joint curtailment with the city of Medicine Hat.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin mining can help to stabilize grids. Texas recently tinkered with the idea of using software to further balance the supply and demand of electricity to its grid using Bitcoin miners. Similar to Texas, Canada also endures temperature extremes. The wild variations require expert grid balancing.\n\nSnowstorms in Alberta. Source: CBC\n\nLeverton explained how Bitcoin mining can support the grid in Medicine Hat, a further example of Bitcoin mining\u2019s role in supporting environmental efficiency:\n\n\u201cAnd in whatever increment, we can take the entire 67 megawatts down and feed the grid if it\u2019s during a snowstorm. Any type of peak demand activity, we can power down and feed the entire amount or as little as half a megawatt.\u201d\n\nCrucially, conversations and educational drives among policymakers might be made easier given that Bitcoin miners are now the largest taxpayers in the region where Hut 8 operates."

Their haul was grand, having somehow come into 119,754 bitcoin from the 2016 hack of Bitfinex, the largest-ever crypto heist. But most of the attention gravitated toward Morgan, better known as Razzlekhan \u2014 a rapper of questionable talent with a prolific social-media output who put out cringey songs about being a hacker nerd.\n\nSince then, Morgan has been under 24-hour house arrest in her apartment on Wall Street and Lichtenstein has been in jail in Washington, D.C., as investigators continue to push the trial date back in order to consider a pretrial resolution \u2014 a timeline that suggests the pair could be cooperating. Meanwhile, Morgan has been looking for work, tweeting in September that she was seeking \u201cremote\u201d jobs for business-to-business tech companies. And according to a court filing Tuesday first reported by Bloomberg News, she has found one: A judge approved a request on January 17 to allow Morgan to work from her new employer\u2019s office Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 10 a.m. until 8:30 p.m.\n\nThere is no information in the filing as to who is employing Morgan.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price has held above $20,700 for 4 days, fueling bulls\u2019 hope for another leg up to $23,000 or even $25,000. Behind the optimistic move was a decline in inflationary pressure, confirmed by the December 2022 wholesale prices for goods on Jan. 18.\n\nThe United States producer price index, which measures final demand prices across hundreds of categories also declined 0.5% versus the previous month.\n\nEurozone inflation also came in at 9.2% year-on-year in December, marking the second consecutive decline from October's 10.7% record high. A milder-than-expected winter reduced the risk of a gas shortages and softened energy prices, boosting analysts\u2019 hope of a \"soft landing.\" According to analysts, a soft landing would avoid a deep recession and possibly convince central banks to curb their interest rate hikes.\n\nThis week\u2019s $580 million BTC options expiry on Jan. 20 looks like an easy win for bulls because the surprise seven-day, 23% rally above $21,000 caused most bearish bets to become worthless. The recent move has holders (or hodlers) calling a market bottom and the potential end to the bear market, but the options market might hold the answer.\n\nCan Bitcoin options help bulls secure the $20,000 floor?\n\nIt might seem like a distant reality right now, but Bitcoin was trading below $17,500 just seven days ago. As the weekly options expiry on Jan. 20 approaches, the bullish bets are about to pay off, while bears will see their options becoming worthless as the deadline looms over them.\n\nBears\u2019 main hope is the possibility of the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates by 50 basis points at the next meeting, but that won\u2019t take place until Feb. 1. The latest data on U.S. retail sales have shown a 1.1% retreat in December, the second consecutive spending cut. The odds are increasingly favorable for a 25 basis point interest rate increase, signaling that the central bank's effort to curb inflation is achieving its expected results.\n\nIf bulls win on Jan. 20, they will likely add buying pressure and fuel the $20,000 support level.\n\nBitcoin bears were caught entirely off-guard\n\nThe open interest for the Jan. 20 options expiry is $580 million, but the actual figure will be lower since bears were decimated after Bitcoin breached $20,000. Bulls are in complete control, even though their payout becomes larger at $21,000 and higher.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for Jan. 20. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe 1.18 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $150 million call (buy) open interest and the $125 million put (sell) options. If Bitcoin\u2019s price remains above $17,000 at 8:00 am UTC on Jan. 13, less than $2 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to sell Bitcoin at $16,500 or $15,500 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\n$21,000 Bitcoin would give bulls a $220 million profit\n\nBelow are the three most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Jan. 20 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $19,000 and $20,000: 7,500 calls vs. 1,700 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $110 million.\n\n7,500 calls vs. 1,700 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $110 million. Between $20,000 and $21,000: 800 calls vs. 8,100 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $165 million.\n\n800 calls vs. 8,100 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $165 million. Between $21,000 and $22,000: 10,600 calls vs. 200 puts. The net result favors bulls by $220 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor example, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price, but unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin sees new 4-month high as US PPI, retail data post 'big misses'\n\nBitcoin bears need to push the price below $20,000 on Friday to minimize the loss. On the other hand, the bulls can double their gains by pumping the price above $21,000 on Jan. 20 and profiting by $220 million.\n\nThe 7-day rally toward $21,300 liquidated $1.2 billion worth of leverage short (sell) futures contracts, so they might have less margin required to subdue Bitcoin's price.\n\nFor now, bulls are well positioned to profit from the BTC weekly options expiry and use the proceeds to defend the $20,000 support.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Controversial Fox news television host Tucker Carlson has proposed a curious conspiracy theory that seeks to link airline delays in the United States and Canada with a surge in the Bitcoin price.\n\nHe suggested the computer outage that caused thousands of grounded flights on Jan. 11 may have been caused by ransomware and theorized the US government may have bought a large amount of Bitcoin to pay the ransom.\n\nHowever he did not provide any evidence for his claims.\n\nSpeaking on his Tucker Carlson Tonight program on Fox News on Jan. 17, Carlson argued that the Bitcoin (BTC) price increased by over 20% soon after the travel chaos:\n\n\u201cAlmost all ransoms like this are paid in Bitcoin. So if the US government was buying huge amounts of Bitcoin in order to pay a ransom, Bitcoin prices would surge, of course. So the question is has that happened? Well yes, it has happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the nationwide ground stop last Thursday the price of Bitcoin has shot up about 20%. Is that a coincidence?\u201d he added.\n\nWhile Tucker\u2019s fanbase online appears to believe the theory is plausible, it was less well-received by the crypto community. Nick Almond, the founder of FactoryDAO, described Tucker\u2019s wild theory as \u201cmaximum tin foil\u201d to his 13,500 Twitter followers:\n\nAlmond replied to supporters of the theory that he doubted very highly that the U.S. government would buy billions in Bitcoin on the open market to pay for the ransoms.\n\nBlockstream CEO and cypherpunk Adam Back also mocked Carlson to his 506,000 Twitter followers, stating that the two events were exactly what Carlson described them to be \u2014 a coincidence:\n\n\"is that a coincidence?\", yes, it is a coincidence. lols. \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) January 17, 2023\n\nOther arguments made against the theory on Crypto Twitter included that the U.S. government already has a large amount of confiscated Bitcoin, that the government would buy it over-the-counter if it did buy it, and thaas Bitcoin is traceable and transparent, large ransoms are more likely to be paid in Monero.\n\nStack Hodler pointed out to his 30,000 followers that the recovery of $5 billionin assets by FTX was a more likely explanation for the recovery in crypto markets:\n\nMorning of Jan 11: All flights grounded in US due to a \"critical tech outage\"\n\n\n\nAfternoon of Jan 11: FTX says it has recovered more than $5 Billion worth of cash\n\n\n\nTucker Carlson: Did the US government buy Bitcoin for a ransom?\n\n\n\nCan you imagine... https://t.co/Bng9VfxHHU pic.twitter.com/VzwbSdt3s9 \u2014 Stack Hodler (@stackhodler) January 17, 2023\n\nMore than 1,300 flights were cancelled with an additional 10,000 flights being delayed in the first two days of the disruption.\n\nRelated: Ripple CTO shuts down ChatGPT\u2019s XRP conspiracy theory\n\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration stated on Jan. 11 that the disruption was caused by a \u201cdamaged database file\u201d in its Notice to Air Mission system, which the agency said was not harmed by a cyberattack.\n\nThe issue has been fixed and flights have resumed normal operations."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price saw a lot of flash rallies last year that only led to more downward price pressure. The new rally to start the new year, however, could actually have legs, as it responds positively to macroeconomic data.\n\nUp over 25% to start the new year, bitcoin\u2019s recent price rally is following strength in traditional financial assets like stocks and bonds. This continues last year\u2019s trend when bitcoin mirrored stocks and bonds on the way down amid rising inflation, but while the trend has reversed, bitcoin has followed.\n\n2022 ended with inflation showing a modest retreat, giving risk assets a boost as the expectation is that the U.S. Federal Reserve will start scaling back on interest rate hikes. That, in effect, is bringing the dollar down and potentially bringing more capital to riskier assets like bitcoin.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing the dollar put in a top, inflation easing, interest rate hikes slowing down \u2013 all pointing to markets getting more risk-on over the next few months,\u201d said Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, in a CNBC report.\n\nThe ICE US Dollar Index and bitcoin\u2019s latest price movements show restored confidence in risk assets again. The index is down 2% while bitcoin has risen close to 20% within the past month, highlighting the early strength in the new year.\n\nInvestors Leaving FTX Collapse in the Past\n\nLast year\u2019s collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX certainly dashed any hopes of a holiday rally as 2022 was winding down. The collapse shook investors\u2019 confidence and kept prospective market entrants at bay who were looking at potentially investing in bitcoin at the current low price.\n\nNonetheless, the early 2023 rally could be a sign that investors are ready to put the FTX collapse behind them. With dissipating inflation and less interest rate hikes, that could continue to fuel a risk-on rally that could feed into higher bitcoin prices.\n\n\u201cBitcoin looks to have recoupled with macro data as investors shrug off the FTX collapse,\u201d James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset management firm CoinShares, told CNBC.\n\n\u201cThe most important macro data investors are focussing on is the weak services PMI and the trending down of employment and wage data,\u201d Butterfill added. \u201cThis coupled with downwards trend in inflation has led to improving confidence, while it comes at a time when valuations for Bitcoin \u2026 are close to all time lows. The prospect of looser monetary policy off the back of weaker macro data and low valuations is what has led this rally.\u201d\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "Billionaire Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund made a timely crypto trade last year.\n\nThe venture capital firm sold most of its cryptocurrency holdings before last year\u2019s market crash, pulling in $1.8 billion from the trade, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.\n\nThe fund, known to invest in groundbreaking technologies, built a position in crypto over time. It made its first bitcoin investment in 2014, and a majority of its crypto holdings were made up of the original cryptocurrency, partners of the fund told TechCrunch in March last year.\n\nFounders Fund, which has $11 billion in assets under management, sold a big chunk of its crypto at the end of March 2022, a source told the FT. Bitcoin traded around $41,976 at the time, down around 40% from its all-time high.\n\nThat well-timed trade was made before the crash of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) in May, which marked the start of the crypto market carnage.\n\nA representative for Founders Fund didn\u2019t return Blockworks\u2019 request for comment by press time.\n\nNotably, Thiel made a pro-bitcoin speech just a month after his fund reportedly sold most of its crypto. He said the rise in bitcoin\u2019s price was an implication that the \u201ccentral banks are bankrupt\u201d and that it signaled \u201cthe end of the fiat money regime.\u201d He also spoke out against bitcoin\u2019s critics, calling billionaire investor Warren Buffett \u201cEnemy No.1\u201d and a \u201csociopathic grandpa from Omaha.\u201d\n\nWhen bitcoin was hovering near $60,000 in 2021, Thiel reportedly said that it was a sign the US political system was not stable. \u201cI don\u2019t know that you should put all your money into bitcoin at $60,000 a bitcoin right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut surely the fact that it is at $60,000 is an extremely hopeful sign.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Thiel said at an event in Miami, in October 2021, that he felt he was \u201cunderinvested\u201d in bitcoin. He also suggested he had some hesitation in investing in it because he thought \u201cthe secret was already known by everybody,\u201d then added that \u201cI think the answers are still to go long\u201d on bitcoin.\n\nCrypto wasn\u2019t the only investment Founders Fund offloaded. Between 2020 and 2022, the fund had eight other big exits including Airbnb and Palantir, a move that allowed it to return about $13 billion to investors, the FT reported.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin held steady near its most recent $21,000 perch, and a leading crypto analyst said the market had already priced in the looming bankruptcy filing of crypto brokerage Genesis Global Capital and other recent industry debacles stemming from the collapse of disgraced crypto exchange FTX .\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,980, up 0.8% over the past 24 hours, even as investors mulled conflicting economic reports.\n\n\u201cMost of the negative news should be priced in\u201d because Genesis has been in trouble since the end of last year, Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign-exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Thursday note.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Genesis, a CoinDesk sister company, was in confidential negotiations with various creditor groups, with Genesis warning it could seek bankruptcy protection if it fails to raise capital. Bitcoin\u2019s price tumbled as low as $20,370, a roughly 5% drop from the previous day, after the U.S. Department of Justice foreshadowed an announcement that it was charging Hong Kong-based crypto exchange Bitzlato with laundering $700 million.\n\nBut the announcement turned out to be \u201canticlimactic, at least in contrast to what the markets were guessing would happen,\u201d said Michael Safai, managing partner of crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital. Safai told CoinDesk that the crypto market's recent positive sentiment could lift further if institutional traders maintain BTC\u2019s trading range between $20,000 and $21,000 over the next couple of days.\n\nEther (ETH) was recently changing hands at around $1,550, up 1.1% from Wednesday, same time. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) recently climbed 1.8%.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional markets continued to stumble this week, with the S&P down 0.7% for the day. The S&P, which has a hefty technology component, is off 2.1% for the past five days, as investors remain fretful about the prospect of recession and big banks kicked off the earnings season with mixed results.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrypto-exposed stocks were also varied: Exchange Coinbase (COIN) was down 1.5% for the day, while bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) was up 6.2%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s strong 2023\n\nThe dip of the past two days has hardly dented bitcoin\u2019s sterling performance so far this year. BTC has gained 26% since Jan. 1, rising from weeks-long doldrums around $17,000.\n\nMartin Leinweber, digital assets product specialist at MarketVector Indexes, attributed bitcoin's recent rally to the weakening U.S. dollar, slower inflation and a short squeeze.\n\nAccording to Coinglass data, traders liquidated some $492 million of short positions on Jan. 13, sending BTC above $20,000.\n\nHowever, Leinweber said that it's still hard to call a market bottom because \"normally in a bear market violent rallies tend to fool investors into believing that this is a sustainable one,\" considering liquidity isn't fully returned yet.\n\n\u201cYou very rarely see these V-shaped bottoms,\u201d he told CoinDesk. \u201cYou see a rounding U-form, which just takes a little bit of time and there's a little bit of volatile in between. That's the best-case scenario. But I think you still need the right macro backdrop for risk assets in general to rise and the crypto can outperform.\u201d"

        "content": "Murphy, North Carolina CNN \u2014\n\nWhen Judy Stines first heard about cryptocurrency, \u201cI always thought it was smoke and mirrors,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if that\u2019s what you want to invest in, you do you.\u201d\n\nBut then she heard the sound of crypto, a noise that neighbor Mike Lugiewicz describes as \u201ca small jet that never leaves\u201d and her ambivalence turned into activism. The racket was coming from stacks and stacks of computer servers and cooling fans, mysteriously set up in a few acres of open farm field down on Harshaw Road.\n\nOnce they fired up and the noise started bouncing around their Blue Ridge Mountain homes, sound meters in the Lugiewicz yard showed readings from 55-85 decibels depending on the weather, but more disturbing than the volume is the fact that the noise never stopped.\n\nMike Lugiewicz describes the noise generated by the nearby crypto mine as \"a small jet that never leaves.\" Julian Quinones/CNN\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a racetrack three miles out right here,\u201d Lugiewicz said, pointing away from the crypto mine next door. \u201cYou can hear the cars running. It\u2019s cool!\u201d \u201cBut at least they stop,\u201d Stines chimed in, \u201cAnd you can go to bed!\u201d\n\nCrypto mining noise This is the sound in front of Mike Lugiewicz\u2019s garage. Source: CNN\n\nThe word \u201cmine\u201d evokes pickaxes and coal dust in this region, so at first, the neighbors around Murphy, North Carolina, had no idea that mining a so-called \u201cproof of work\u201d crypto coin is more like playing a computer game with billion-sided dice. Instead of shovels, modern miners need enormous amounts of server power to roll the winning number faster than their competitors around the world.\n\nThis unrelenting demand for electricity was one reason China banned cryptocurrency, touching off a virtual gold rush from Appalachia to New York\u2019s Finger Lakes. Crypto miners began putting down stakes in places where power is cheap and affordable, and if land use or noise regulations even exist, enforcement is weak. The mine in Murphy is just one of a dozen in Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina owned by a San Francisco-based company called PrimeBlock, which recently announced $300 million in equity financing and plans to scale up and go public.\n\nBut a year and a half after crypto came to this ruby red pocket of Republican retirees and Libertarian life-timers, anger over the mine helped flip the balance of local power and forced the Board of Commissioners to officially ask their state and federal officials to \u201cintroduce and champion legislation through the US Congress that would ban and/or regulate crypto mining operations in the United States of America.\u201d\n\n\u201cI personally think that if we can get a bill into the system, other (North Carolina) counties will join,\u201d newly elected Chairman Cal Stiles said after the motion was read. When it passed 5-0, the crowd cheered.\n\n\u201cOh boy, they wanted us so bad a year ago,\u201d PrimeBlock co-owner Chandler Song replied via LinkedIn DM when asked about the move to outlaw his crypto mine. \u201cIt is unconstitutional, to say the least.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Song and his co-founder Ryan Fang made the Forbes \u201cBig Money\u201d 30 under 30 list which features young entrepreneurs with over $10 million in funding. According to the profile, they founded their first blockchain company, ANKR Network, in 2017 when they were in their early 20s.\n\nANKR was eventually folded into the umbrella company PrimeBlock and in the final quarter of 2021, they claimed \u201c$24.4 million of revenue, and over 110 megawatts of installed data center capacity.\u201d This came as Song and Fang teamed up with former Goldman Sachs investment banker Gaurav Budhrani to create a company with an \u201cestimated enterprise value of $1.25 billion\u201d with the hopes of selling public stock on the Nasdaq.\n\nA crypto mine sits in a field along a rural road in Murphy, North Carolina. Mike Belleme/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nA few weeks after that announcement, residents packed the Cherokee County Board meeting where representatives from the company were scheduled to appear, but soon learned that management had changed their minds after a power outage at another crypto site nearby.\n\n\u201cWhen (the outage) was investigated, it was found out that the power outage occurred because someone shot, with a gun, one of the (service lines),\u201d County Commission Chair Dan Eichenbaum told the room to groans. \u201cAs a result of that, the crypto mining people decided they weren\u2019t going to come.\u201d \u201cThey could have joined over video!\u201d one resident said to the board in frustration after the clerk read the company\u2019s statement explaining they canceled \u201cfor employee safety.\u201d\n\nMonths later, Song told The Washington Post that he had received no noise complaints from Cherokee County and said he would build noise insulation walls and install quieter water-based cooling systems. But after erecting walls on only two sides of the mine, construction stopped and the dashed hopes of the community only poured more fuel on local anger as they headed to the polls.\n\nAn aerial view of Murphy, North Carolina. Julian Quinones/CNN\n\n\u201cI\u2019m old. I\u2019m a senior citizen. Social media is not really in my bailiwick,\u201d Stines said as she explained how noise pollution transformed her into an activist. \u201cI like to be behind the scenes and I like to stir the pot. But I knew that we needed to win an election.\u201d\n\nChandler Song went silent when presented with follow-up questions on LinkedIn, but the mine on Hershaw Road roars on as the Cherokee County attorney searches for ways to put legal teeth into a newly passed law against continuous noise without rankling liberty-loving landowners.\n\n\u201cThe Tennessee Valley Authority does not pursue cryptocurrency mines and it is not one of our target markets,\u201d Scott Fiedler, a spokesman for the TVA told CNN. But he acknowledged that the federally owned utility that serves millions in seven states does not keep track of the mines using TVA power, and it\u2019s up to local utilities like the Murphy Electric Power Board to decide who gets service and who gets cut in a blackout.\n\nRon Wright said when his power was cut this winter, the crypto mine stayed online. Julian Quinones/CNN\n\nThat last contingency brought even more bad blood and lost trust during the brutal winter storm that gripped much of the South and forced some of the first rolling blackouts in TVA history. While residents were plunged into cold darkness, they say the power-hungry mine kept humming.\n\n\u201cThey shut us down on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day every hour for anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes to an hour,\u201d resident Ron Wright told CNN. \u201cWell, once your power goes down, your heat pumps go off and pipes freeze. But less than one mile away is crypto, allowed to run on the low end. As soon as the power came back, boom! They\u2019re cranking before we are.\u201d Requests for comment from the Murphy Electric Power Board were not returned.\n\nBack on Harshaw Road, Mike Lugiewicz pointed to the For Sale sign in front of his house. \u201cSeptember of 2021, I think, is when they turned this on and my wife and I just shook our heads, said, \u2018No, we\u2019re out of here.\u2019\u201d He hopes to stay in the area and keep fighting alongside neighbors like Judy Stines until the quiet comes back.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really care what folks invest in,\u201d Stines said with a sigh. \u201cI do care about this noise that affects us every day, all day, all night. It\u2019s never-ending.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct a quote from Judy Stines."

Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), a tokenized and 1:1 backed version of BTC on Ethereum, has seen its supply on the Ethereum blockchain drop by 35% since May.\n\nA Jan. 17 tweet from Glassnode revealed the May 2022 all-time high of 285,000 WBTC on Ethereum came right before the price collapse of TerraLunaClassic (LUNC) and its paired algorithmic stablecoin TerraClassicUSD (USTC).\n\nThe total $WBTC Balance wrapped on #Ethereum has declined by over 35% since the collapse of the LUNA/UST project\n\n\n\nAt the peak, there were 285k #Bitcoin wrapped on #Ethereum, and this has since fallen by 101.55k $WBTC over the course of 2022\n\n\n\nLive Chart: https://t.co/y3COK5pbuA pic.twitter.com/QWRYyBcV7j \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) January 17, 2023\n\nThe amount of WBTC has fallen by 101,550 over the course of 2022 and the blockchain now hosts around 183,500 tokenized Bitcoin."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nJP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon remains a skeptic of almost everything Bitcoin\u2014including the idea that its total supply is limited to 21 million coins.\n\n\u201cHow do you know it's gonna stop at 21 million?\u201d he asked while discussing crypto with CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box on Thursday. \u201cMaybe it's gonna get to 21 million and Satoshi\u2019s picture is gonna come up and laugh at you all.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time he has questioned Bitcoin\u2019s holy number\u2014a defining feature frequently highlighted by the asset\u2019s biggest boosters. Theoretically, an absolute supply cap would give Bitcoin greater scarcity than any government-issued currency on earth, empowering it as a store of value.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou all read the algorithms? You guys all believe that? I don't know, I've always been a skeptic of stuff like that,\u201d he said at an Institute for International Finance event last October.\n\nMany have, in fact, read Bitcoin\u2019s algorithms\u2014which are open source and freely viewable by the entire world. As pointed out by Jameson Lopp, co-founder of the Bitcoin wallet company Casa, Bitcoin\u2019s supply cap is implicitly enforced by just 5 lines of code.\n\nTo be precise, Bitcoin is programmed to cut its supply issuance rate in half every 210,000 blocks, which is roughly every four years. Whereas 50 new BTC were issued per block in 2009, only 6.25 BTC come attached to each block today.\n\nThese events, called \u201chalvings,\u201d are programmed to occur just 33 times, after which Bitcoin\u2019s block reward will be cut to zero. This should occur by the year 2141, assuming nothing changes before that time, Bitcoin developer Luke DashJr told Decrypt.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter 10 halvings, rounding errors begin to truncate,\u201d he specified, referring to the problem of block rewards being unable to divide past Satoshis by the year 2049. \u201cSo if more precision is hardforked in, ideally it should be by 2049.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe math behind these halvings works out such that Bitcoin\u2019s supply cannot touch or surpass 21 million.\n\nThat said, anything enforced by code can technically be changed, as long as users consent to it. Many argue that the Bitcoin community will be forced to upgrade its software to produce more than 21 million coins, in order to provide consistent funds to support the mining industry.\n\n2/ Bitcoin has never generated meaningful transaction revenue relative to its security budget, heavily subsidizing security with block rewards. The current model is unsustainable, weakening its likelihood of becoming the global reserve currency. \u2014 Dan Smith (@smyyguy) January 10, 2023\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s supply is limited, it is still infinitely divisible. Tiny units of the currency could still be used for small transactions, even if its price were to enter the seven-figure range."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), could grow by 35% versus Bitcoin (BTC) this year to hit 0.1 BTC for the first time since 2018 as it forms a classic bullish continuation pattern.\n\nEthereum price must first break key resistance\n\nDubbed an ascending triangle, the pattern forms when the price fluctuates inside a range defined by rising trendline support and horizontal trendline resistance. It typically resolves after the price breaks out in the direction of its previous trend.\n\nOn a weekly chart, the ETH/BTC pair has been painting an ascending pattern since May 2021. The Ethereum token eyes a breakout above the pattern's horizontal trendline resistance near 0.0776 BTC. Breaking this level could then see the price rally by as much as the triangle's maximum height.\n\nIn other words, the ETH/BTC pair could reach the next big resistance level at 0.1 BTC in 2023, or 35% from the current price levels.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nNonetheless, it is important to mention that ETH/BTC has attempted to break above the triangle's resistance trendline eight times since May 2021. The attempts included two major breakouts in November 2021 and September 2022, which saw the pair rallying 14% and 9%, respectively.\n\nBoth rallies fizzled out inside the 0.082 to 0.085 BTC area, followed by extreme price corrections that took ETH/BTC back inside the triangle range. Given this multi-year hurdle, the pair could face stiff resistance inside the 0.082 to 0.085 BTC range, even if it breaks above the triangle.\n\nSuch a move would risk crashing ETH toward the triangle support, which coincides with its 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA), represented by the red line in the chart above, near 0.070 BTC, down nearly 6% from the current price levels.\n\nETH \"deflation\" narrative\n\nEther\u2019s bullish setup versus Bitcoin appears as ETH dominance has doubled versus other crypto assets in the past few years.\n\nNotably, ETH\u2019s market capitalization has risen to nearly 20.5% of the entire crypto market valuation in January 2023, from about 10% in December 2020, when the Ethereum network started its transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) with the launch of a dedicated staking smart contract.\n\nETH.D weekly performance chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBecoming a PoS blockchain has brought two key changes to Ethereum\u2019s economy. First, users temporarily lock away a portion of their Ether holdings into Ethereum\u2019s PoS smart contract to earn yield. And second, the Ethereum network has started burning some transaction fees.\n\nRelated: Ethereum \u2018shark\u2019 accumulation, Shanghai hard fork put $2K ETH price in play\n\nBoth changes have had a deflationary impact on overall supply. As a result, the Ethereum network now regularly produces fewer Ether tokens than are taken out of circulation, which theoretically makes ETH a \u201cdeflationary\u201d asset.\n\nETH supply change since the Ethereum PoS upgrade in September 2022. Source: UltraSound.Money\n\nThe ETH/BTC price has grown nearly 250% since December 2020 despite still being down roughly 50% from its all-time highs witnessed in 2017.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The market has seen the most substantial investor optimism since July due to the January BTC price rebound.\n\nAccording to data from crypto analytics firm Santiment, the trading crowd sentiment has touched its highest in six months and second highest bullish sentiment in the past 14 months. The data indicates that traders are treating Bitcoin\u2019s price rebound as a signal of a possible bigger breakout in the near future.\n\nThe term \u201ccrowd/investor sentiment\u201d describes how investors generally feel about a specific asset or financial market. It refers to the mood of a market, or the psychology of its participants, as expressed by activity and changes in the price of the asset exchanged in that market.\n\nBitcoin weighted social sentiment Source: Santiment\n\nThe chart above shows three major spikes in investor sentiment since 2021. The first major spike in sentiment came in November 2021, followed by the BTC price surge to a new all-time high of $68,789. The second major spike came in July 2022 amid hints from the United States Federal Reserve about possible inflation ease, followed by a minor price surge. While the price rise post-spike in crowd sentiments in July 2022 wasn\u2019t very significant due to marketwide bearish sentiment, traders did buy the dip at $19,000.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price rally over $21K prompts analysts to explore where BTC price might go next\n\nThe latest spike in crowd sentiment came after a prolonged winter in 2022.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe price of bitcoin is up by almost a third since the start of the year, leading to speculation that the prolonged \u2018crypto winter\u2019 is finally beginning to thaw.\n\nThe world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency was trading above $21,000 on Thursday, pushing its market cap higher than $400 billion for the first time since November.\n\nThe latest gains come amid easing inflation and signs that the US Federal Reserves will slow interest rate rises over the coming months, leading to improved sentiment and an increased appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) have also seen significant gains in recent weeks, pushing the overall crypto market cap back towards $1 trillion.\n\nDespite the turnaround in fortunes, the global crypto currency market remains a long way off its peak of close to $3 trillion in November 2021.\n\nThe upward momentum saw short sellers lose hundreds of millions of dollars in the space of just a few days, according to a report from crypto investment service BitStacker.\n\nThose betting against bitcoin lost $386.74 million in liquidations between 10 to 16 January, the analysis found, with more than $140m lost on just a single day.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s always sad to see traders losing money on their investments, the study does show that cryptocurrencies might finally be bouncing back,\u201d said BitStacker analyst Kris Lucas.\n\n\u201c2022 was a very tough year for cryptocurrencies with the collapse of several major exchanges, as well as the Terra stablecoin. However, the fact that bitcoin is starting to regain its value could suggest that the so-called crypto winter could soon be over.\u201d\n\nView more\n\nA mini flash crash on Wednesday, which saw BTC drop by $1,000 in the space of an hour, demonstrated that the recovery is still in the fragile early stages, and could easily be shaken by some negative news.\n\nThe price dip came after the US government announced a press conference for some major crypto-related news, leading to fears that it could be damaging for the crypto space. The news turned out to be the dismantling of a crime network, and the price returned to a positive trajectory.\n\nThe stalled rally showed that it is too soon to know whether or not bitcoin has reached its lowest price point this cycle, though it is the most positive move for the crypto market in nearly a year.\n\nFavourable market conditions could see bitcoin begin to recapture some of its losses in 2023, according to Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, who cites US inflation data in his forecast for the year ahead.\n\n\u201cWe are technically still in a bear market, but the signs are the bulls are beginning to take back control,\u201d Mr Green told The Independent.\n\n\u201cAs the central banks begin to stop tightening the screws, and the cyclical upturn gets underway, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin could outperform other asset classes. Knowing they are likely to be rewarded for doing so, many crypto investors are positioning themselves now for the pivot.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018crypto winter\u2019 is thawing amid growing signs that inflation is beginning to cool. Of course, the crypto market will not go in a straight line \u2013 no market ever does \u2013 but we expect the bears to go into hibernation and bulls are ready to run.\u201d"

        "title": "Gold Rush 2.0? Why BC Is Putting the Brakes on Bitcoin - TheTyee.ca",
        "content": "When most people think about bitcoin, they likely think of a shiny new tech industry that operates somewhere in \u201cthe cloud.\u201d\n\nAnnouncements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners CONTEST: Win Two Tickets to Handel One lucky Tyee reader will win a pair of seats to see the famous composer\u2019s music brought to life in Vancouver this March.\n\nMost aren\u2019t imagining an old mill site in the village of Canal Flats, B.C., population 668.\n\nBut over the past five years, cryptocurrency operators have increasingly been setting up shop in the sawdust left by B.C.\u2019s declining forest industry. Inside warehouses that house the operations, the steady hum of computers and a web of wires log thousands of transactions that ping around the globe daily. Their polished stainless-steel interiors reflect a glimmer of hope for communities in decline.\n\nBut the crypto industry has also seen peaks and valleys in recent years \u2014 and not just those of rural B.C.\n\nBitcoin, which makes up almost 40 per cent of all cryptocurrencies, has become increasingly known for its heavy environmental footprint, with the massive computers required to run the industry drawing more power than countries such as Finland and Chile.\n\nThat has brought bitcoin miners to B.C. in search of greener energy. They require three things: sufficient space, a renewable power source and an internet connection. They\u2019ve found it in the old mill sites and industrial infrastructure of forestry towns \u2014 places like Houston, Ocean Falls and, of course, Canal Flats.\n\nBut the jobs provided by the industry \u2014 a few hundred provincewide, by one estimate \u2014 haven\u2019t come close to replacing the void left by forestry. The province\u2019s biggest bitcoin miner, Australia-based Iris Energy, provides about 60 jobs. The company has also been hit by bitcoin\u2019s recent downturn, which has led to a drop in production and fear of layoffs. It now faces a class-action lawsuit in the U.S.\n\nB.C.\u2019s Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation says its announcement last month that it would pause new power requests from cryptocurrency operations has nothing to do with the industry\u2019s volatility and everything to do with preserving B.C.\u2019s power supply.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency mining consumes massive amounts of electricity to run and cool banks of high-powered computers 24/7/365, while creating very few jobs in the local economy,\u201d B.C.\u2019s mines minister, Josie Osborne, said in a news release. Yet unlike mineral mining, which undertakes an approval process under B.C.\u2019s Mines Act, crypto miners only need to request power from BC Hydro.\n\nSeven existing cryptocurrency mining operations and six in the advanced stages of development will be allowed to proceed under the new rules. The province says it is pausing 21 additional projects that are requesting a total of 1,403 megawatts \u2014 more than 10 per cent of the province\u2019s power supply, equivalent to approximately 570,000 homes or 2.1 million electric vehicles.\n\nThe ministry declined to provide details on operations in the province, calling the information \u201ccommercially sensitive.\u201d\n\nIt says the 18-month suspension will provide time to create a \u201cpermanent framework\u201d for the industry \u2014 and to preserve its electricity supply for things like electric vehicles and greening B.C.\u2019s existing economy.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like gold 2.0\u2019\n\nDaniel Roberts visibly stiffens at the mention that bitcoin may be a volatile asset.\n\nThe co-founder and co-CEO of Iris Energy, a company he started with his brother, Will, got his first taste of bitcoin in 2013. Roberts invested just as the digital currency, which had been in existence for about five years at that time, approached $1,000 a coin. Months later, following a high-profile internet security breach, bitcoin plummeted and Roberts\u2019 investment lost nearly half its value.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018This is nonsense\u2019 and sold it all,\u201d the Australian entrepreneur says over a Zoom call from his home in Sydney, jokingly referring to the currency as \u201csilly, magic internet money.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow wrong I was,\u201d he says.\n\nAs Roberts points out, despite bitcoin\u2019s undulating value, the digital currency has trended upward over the past decade. Today, a single coin is worth about C$28,000 \u2014 well above what Roberts paid a decade ago but a far cry from its peak of C$80,000 in 2021.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like gold 2.0,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cWhat gives gold value? Transferability, scarcity, divisibility, durability \u2014 it\u2019s objectively better at being gold than gold is.\u201d\n\nBut some economists disagree.\n\nWerner Antweiler, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia\u2019s Sauder School of Business, has been studying bitcoin since its early days. In a 2011 blog post, he called the currency a terrible idea.\n\nA decade later, his opinion hasn\u2019t changed.\n\n\u201cIt looks a lot like a Ponzi scheme,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people, economists like myself, have looked at it and said, \u2018Wait a minute. This is not a sound business model.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor many, bitcoin\u2019s appeal is that it operates outside traditional markets. It\u2019s not controlled by governments or other regulatory bodies, and its distributed ledgers mean that each transaction is duplicated multiple times around the world. Those ledgers create a blockchain, a history of each transaction meant to provide duplicity and security, and its decentralized nature is appealing to those who distrust central banks.\n\nThe product has no intrinsic value \u2014 or even physical presence. Its value relies solely on the worth assigned by markets. As a result, it leans heavily on hype.\n\n\u201cIn that sense, it\u2019s like buying a piece of art or gold or something, that is essentially just an asset we hold and sell,\u201d Antweiler says. \u201cWhether or not it\u2019s good and holding value, that is completely driven by the market.\u201d\n\nHere in B.C., Antweiler estimates the industry may provide \u201ca few hundred jobs.\u201d But what makes it so egregious, he says, is its wastefulness.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at how much electricity is now being used for bitcoin mining around the world, it\u2019s absolutely shocking,\u201d he says. \u201cI have not yet found anyone who can point me to any significant economic value that could come from using any of these crypto tools or crypto assets and that is, unfortunately, the bottom line.\u201d\n\n\u2018Mopping up\u2019 surplus energy in mill towns?\n\nCryptocurrency operations first began plugging into the B.C. power grid in 2018.\n\nChina had recently shifted from being the global epicenter of cryptocurrency mining to banning the operations in 2017. As some operators sought to green the industry\u2019s image, they looked to B.C., which appeared to have an abundance of renewable power.\n\nThe province\u2019s total generating capacity is more than 12,000 megawatts. An additional 1,100 megawatts are projected to come online once the Site C hydroelectric project is completed in 2024. BC Hydro says its power is 98 per cent renewable, most of it from the province\u2019s many dammed waterways.\n\nAt the start, B.C. cryptocurrency operations drew just a handful of megawatts from the grid. The province appeared keen to attract new business, initially considering a \u201cload-attraction\u201d rate for new cryptocurrency operations.\n\nBut it quickly changed course.\n\nBC Hydro commissioned a load forecast study in 2018 reporting that, by September of that year, formal service requests had grown to 87 megawatts. But the province faced inquiries totalling nearly 2,000 megawatts \u2014 roughly a sixth of its total power supply.\n\nThe report described cryptocurrency as an \u201cemerging\u201d industry, alongside cannabis, that was expected to accelerate demand for power, albeit with a significant amount of uncertainty. \u201cThis is acutely the case for cryptocurrency,\u201d the report added. \u201cThe business viability is ultimately dependent on cryptocurrency prices which are extremely volatile.\u201d\n\nDespite early indications that BC Hydro might offer incentives to cryptocurrency operations, when it announced its Clean Industry and Innovation Rate in 2021, which aimed to attract clean tech industries, it explicitly excluded cryptocurrency.\n\nThat\u2019s \u201cdue to the number of crypto requests to connect,\u201d which showed unprecedented interest from the industry without any incentives, the provincial power regulator explained in an email to The Tyee.\n\nIt was into this shifting landscape that Iris Energy stepped in 2019.\n\nAccording to Roberts, B.C. was facing the combined effects of a declining forest industry coupled with expanded hydroelectric infrastructure. He says the province had a surplus of renewable energy, something that was actually costing ratepayers money.\n\n\u201cWhen you had the pulp and paper industry shut down and the province continued to build out Site C, you end up with this enormous oversupply of energy that someone still has to pay for,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, we thought, let\u2019s come in, let\u2019s go into these regional towns where they\u2019ve been decimated economically by the closure of these mills, leverage a lot of the existing electrical infrastructure, rehire a number of the local workers, retrain them in what we do.\u201d\n\nThe company was \u201cmopping up some of that surplus power\u201d and providing BC Hydro with an alternative revenue line, relieving the burden on residents, Roberts says.\n\nAt the same time, it was greening the bitcoin industry, he adds.\n\nAntweiler calls the claims \u201ccomplete greenwashing.\u201d He says the idea that B.C.-based operations are reducing bitcoin\u2019s environmental footprint goes against the very nature of the industry.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do bitcoin mining only in B.C. That is impossible by the nature of the transaction. The moment bitcoins are mined, they\u2019re mined everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the global footprint that matters.\u201d\n\nIn an email, BC Hydro says that it sells any surplus energy to Powerex, its energy trading branch, which sells clean energy in the western U.S. and Mexico at average wholesale market prices, providing revenue to the Crown corporation.\n\n\u2018The big economic driver is still the forest industry\u2019\n\nIris Energy currently operates three of B.C.\u2019s seven operating cryptocurrency facilities \u2014 in Canal Flats, Mackenzie and Prince George. Combined, they draw 160 megawatts, about 60 per cent of the power dedicated to 13 operations that have been allowed to move forward since the province announcement it would hit pause on new connection requests.\n\nIt was a connection with Vanderhoof businessman Brian Fehr that originally brought the company to B.C., Roberts says.\n\nFehr, an Order of BC recipient, had been buying up old mill sites across the province \u2014 in places like Vavenby, Cranbrook, Isle Pierre and Fort Nelson. Among them was a shuttered Canfor sawmill in Canal Flats, which he retooled as the Columbia Lake Technology Center in 2018, with then-premier John Horgan in attendance at the launch.\n\nThe following year, Iris Energy bought into the venture, establishing its first Canadian operation, which officially launched in 2021.\n\nAt the time, Fehr spoke enthusiastically about more bitcoin operations on the horizon: \u201cWe\u2019re already building in Mackenzie, we\u2019re already working in Chetwynd, we\u2019ve got many sites going now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe went after sites where BC Hydro has a surplus of power.\u201d\n\nBut while Fehr remains an investor in Iris Energy, he is not directly involved in the company\u2019s two recent operations, which opened last year in Mackenzie and Prince George. No operations have yet materialized in Chetwynd, although Fehr bought the town\u2019s sawmill site in March.\n\nRoberts says he can\u2019t talk about the company\u2019s future plans in B.C. but indicates that more mining facilities \u2014 and partnerships with the Brian Fehr Group \u2014 could be in the works.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a number of other development projects that we\u2019re working on with Brian,\u201d he says.\n\nFehr did not respond to The Tyee\u2019s requests for an interview.\n\nBrian Fehr\u2019s sister, Lorri Fehr, is CEO at the Columbia Lake Technology Center and works with her brother on his various business ventures across the province. She says bitcoin was \u201cnot our first strategy.\u201d The family comes from a forestry background and their interests focus on providing economic development opportunities in rural communities.\n\nBut when the siblings met the Roberts brothers, something clicked.\n\n\u201cWhat mattered there was the shared values,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had decided very clearly at the beginning of the Columbia Lake Tech Center that we were only going to offer clean, green, sustainable, First Nations-friendly, community-friendly \u2014 that\u2019s what we want our site to be. These guys from Australia came and they really clicked with those values.\u201d\n\nIn addition to providing about 20 full-time jobs, she says Iris Energy has offered locals in Canal Flats the opportunity to learn entry-level tech skills. Canal Flats Mayor Mark Doherty adds that infrastructure upgrades have also attracted the interest of other technology companies.\n\n\u201cIt does help out the economy here. We would like to see more of that stuff coming here,\u201d Doherty says. \u201cThey employ a lot of people and they\u2019ve been a good steward of the community.\u201d\n\nIronically, while the tech industry has supplied some new employment, it has also taken it away \u2014 the Canal Flats mill had 120 workers when it closed, Doherty says. If it were to start up again today, it would employ fewer than 70 people, a result of technological efficiencies in the forest industry \u2014 but still three times the number of jobs offered on the site as a crypto operation.\n\nMackenzie Mayor Joan Atkinson is also quick to acknowledge that bitcoin isn\u2019t about to replace what was lost with a decline in the forest industry.\n\nAtkinson moved to the community more than 25 years ago for her husband\u2019s work in forestry. Her two sons, now grown but still living in the region, also went on to work in the industry.\n\nThe community of roughly 3,200 residents was founded on forestry. Located two hours north of Prince George, it was one of B.C.\u2019s instant towns, created to service logging operations after the Williston Reservoir opened up new timber to the north. When Atkinson arrived in the late 1990s, there were three sawmills, a large pulp and paper mill and a pulp mill, she says.\n\nThat all changed with an uplift in timber harvest during the mountain pine beetle epidemic and subsequent hauling of timber to mills farther afield. Canfor\u2019s Mackenzie mill closed in 2019, eliminating more than 400 local jobs.\n\n\u201cBut the big economic driver is still the forest industry,\u201d she adds.\n\nToday, the community has a lot going for it, Atkinson says. Real estate prices are among the lowest in the province and it has enough family doctors for everyone. In addition, the town offers easy access to outdoor adventure, with new bike trails, paddling and its own one-lift ski hill.\n\nIris Energy employs about 15 people full time in Mackenzie. They\u2019re jobs Atkinson says the community is happy to take. The company has also purchased industrial land from the district, provided $100,000 in annual community grants and contributes to the tax base \u2014 even if it\u2019s not on the same scale as heavy industry.\n\nShe describes the company as \u201cgood corporate citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t fill the void of a shutdown sawmill,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019re used to the old sawmill days when 40 people showed up for a shift.\u201d\n\nIndustry instability \u2014 and lawsuits\n\nProvincewide, Roberts says Iris Energy employs about 60 people \u2014 10 in Vancouver and the rest spread over its three operations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hired locally, we\u2019ve sourced all our trades and equipment where we can locally and, again, we\u2019d like to think that we\u2019ve contributed to keeping power prices low,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t employ as many people as the pulp and paper industry. But at least we\u2019re coming into these regional communities, adding economic activity and a new level of employment.\u201d\n\nBut last year\u2019s downturn in bitcoin underscored the industry\u2019s instability.\n\nOn Nov. 2, Iris Energy announced that as a result of the drop in bitcoin prices, some equipment was not producing enough revenue to cover more than $100 million in debt on the machines. The loans, which were arranged through \u201cspecial purpose vehicles,\u201d or subsidiaries that provide financing protection to the parent company, were called in by the lenders.\n\nRoberts says that the company is currently \u201creplacing some of the computers\u201d in Canal Flats as a result.\n\nIt means output is down. The company\u2019s hashrate, or computing power, dropped by more than half from October to November 2022.\n\nDespite rumours that the Canal Flats operation could see layoffs, that hasn\u2019t happened, he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s given the guys on site a bit of a breather and an opportunity to catch up on broader things,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cIt means we\u2019re making less cash today than we would have been three months ago, but it\u2019s very much a short-term thing.\u201d\n\nFollowing the November announcement, Iris Energy stocks tumbled to an all-time low. By late December, they bottomed out at US$1.06 \u2014 losing more than 90 percent of their value over November 2021, when the shares entered the market at US$28.\n\nLast month, the class-action lawsuit filed in the U.S. claimed Iris Energy \u201cfailed to disclose material adverse facts\u201d about its business, thereby harming investors. The claims have yet to be proven before the court.\n\nWhen asked about the lawsuit, Roberts demurs.\n\n\u201cI would have to check. I know for a fact that one was lodged and withdrawn very quickly late last year,\u201d he says, blaming market fluctuations and investor anxiety. \u201cWhether there\u2019s another one afoot today, I\u2019d need to go and check. It\u2019s not something that we\u2019re overly concerned with at the moment,\u201d he adds.\n\nRobert Willoughby, investor relations manager with Pomerantz LLP, one of the law firms pursuing the court action against Iris Energy, confirmed that a class-action against Iris Energy is moving ahead.\n\nBC Hydro expresses caution\n\nBoth bitcoin and Iris Energy appear to be rebounding with the new year. Bitcoin\u2019s price has climbed from $22,000 a month ago to $28,000 this week. Iris Energy shares closed at US$1.92 on Wednesday, up from a low point of US$1.06 in December.\n\nRoberts is optimistic. \u201cI think bitcoin is here to stay,\u201d he says, but adds that the infrastructure being built could be used for all types of data.\n\nAlthough the Mines Ministry says bitcoin\u2019s recent downturn had no bearing on its decision to halt new operations, BC Hydro expressed caution about dedicating too much of its power supply to the industry. Moving ahead with the spike in requests would have meant \u201csignificant upgrades\u201d to the province\u2019s energy delivery systems, at a cost to consumers, senior media relations advisor Kyle Donaldson adds.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to keeping rates affordable for our customers and protecting them against a volatile industry that could potentially reduce electricity supply,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have heard from communities and individuals about recent concerns over the state of the cryptocurrency industry and the risks of allocating electricity that puts significant risk on other industries they are looking to attract to their region.\u201d\n\nRoberts says that BC Hydro\u2019s announcement \u2014 which came as the province broke records for residential power use during December\u2019s cold snap \u2014 didn\u2019t come as a surprise.\n\n\u201cWe get it. We welcome it,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end of the day, we want to be solving problems in markets that we go into, we want to be using surplus energy.\u201d\n\nManitoba also suspended new cryptocurrency connections in November and Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec previously undertook a similar process that resulted in higher rates and a cap on electricity for cryptocurrency mining.\n\nAs for what B.C.\u2019s current pause could bring, the Mines Ministry says it\u2019s too soon to say. Antweiler notes that financial regulation ultimately comes from the federal government.\n\nHe adds that now is not the time to be expending energy on a product with questionable value.\n\n\u201cAnyone who\u2019s concerned about climate change can only look at crypto technologies and say, \u2018Do we really need this at a time when we\u2019re trying to reduce our environmental footprint and are concerned about climate change?\u2019\u201d he says."

        "content": "The accused crypto burglar and rapper who dubs herself \u201cThe Crocodile of Wall Street\u201d and \u201cRazzlekhan\u201d has landed a job with a tech company \u2014 even though she\u2019s under house arrest for allegedly orchestrating a scheme to launder $4.5 billion of stolen bitcoin.\n\nHeather Morgan, 31, is now employed by an unknown tech firm despite the legal peril she and her husband, Ilya Lichtenstein, face over accusations they attempted to launder 119,754 bitcoin that they are said to have stolen when the Bitfinex crypto exchange was hacked in 2016.\n\nA federal magistrate judge granted a request by her attorney to modify the terms of her home confinement so that she can work three days a week from the New York City offices of a tech company, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nFederal prosecutors raised no objection to the request.\n\nMorgan will work for the unnamed company \u201cin the role of growth marketing and business development specialist,\u201d according to her attorney, Eugene Gorokhov.\n\n3 Morgan will work three days a week at the New York office of an unnamed tech company, according to court filings. YouTube\n\nThe judge also approved Gorokhov\u2019s request to keep the name of the company sealed so as to protect Morgan\u2019s safety. Federal prosecutors have been made aware of which company is employing Morgan.\n\n\u201cThat information is not noted in this public filing due to the fact that Ms. Morgan has been subject to disparaging comments and harassment on social media as a result of the intense media coverage of this case,\u201d Gorokhov said.\n\nShe will work at the firm for three days every week from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., according to the court filing cited by Bloomberg News.\n\nMorgan and Lichtenstein, who allegedly used tricks that were \u201cpulled from the pages of a spy novel,\u201d were charged by the federal government last February for what was described at the time as the largest financial seizure ever by authorities.\n\nThey face up to 25 years in prison on charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\n3 Morgan and her husband, Ilya Lichtenstein, face up to 25 years in federal prison.\n\nWhile Morgan was freed on $3 million bond, her husband was not granted bail and has remained in federal custody since his arrest last year.\n\nIn March of last year, the couple asked to delay the case so as to start negotiating a plea deal. Another court hearing is scheduled for later this month.\n\nFederal authorities were initially opposed to bail for the couple due to a purported flight risk.\n\nProsecutors argued in court that Morgan and Lichtenstein had \u201caccess to numerous fraudulent identities and documents purchased on the darknet, and the ability to easily acquire more.\u201d\n\nThe feds asserted that the couple \u201chave been setting up a contingency plan for a life in Ukraine and/or Russia prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nIn January of last year, federal agents raided the couple\u2019s apartment and retrieved multiple phones and SIM cards.

        "content": "Bitcoin fell from an all-time price high of close to $69,000 in November 2021 to below $16,000 in November 2022 (Getty Images/ iStock)\n\nThe price of bitcoin is up by almost a third since the start of the year, leading to speculation that the prolonged \u2018crypto winter\u2019 is finally beginning to thaw.\n\nThe world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency was trading above $21,000 on Thursday, pushing its market cap higher than $400 billion for the first time since November.\n\nThe latest gains come amid easing inflation and signs that the US Federal Reserves will slow interest rate rises over the coming months, leading to improved sentiment and an increased appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) have also seen significant gains in recent weeks, pushing the overall crypto market cap back towards $1 trillion.\n\nDespite the turnaround in fortunes, the global crypto currency market remains a long way off its peak of close to $3 trillion in November 2021.\n\nThe upward momentum saw short sellers lose hundreds of millions of dollars in the space of just a few days, according to a report from crypto investment service BitStacker.\n\nThose betting against bitcoin lost $386.74 million in liquidations between 10 to 16 January, the analysis found, with more than $140m lost on just a single day.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s always sad to see traders losing money on their investments, the study does show that cryptocurrencies might finally be bouncing back,\u201d said BitStacker analyst Kris Lucas.\n\n\u201c2022 was a very tough year for cryptocurrencies with the collapse of several major exchanges, as well as the Terra stablecoin. However, the fact that bitcoin is starting to regain its value could suggest that the so-called crypto winter could soon be over.\u201d\n\nA mini flash crash on Wednesday, which saw BTC drop by $1,000 in the space of an hour, demonstrated that the recovery is still in the fragile early stages, and could easily be shaken by some negative news.\n\nThe price dip came after the US government announced a press conference for some major crypto-related news, leading to fears that it could be damaging for the crypto space. The news turned out to be the dismantling of a crime network, and the price returned to a positive trajectory.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stalled rally showed that it is too soon to know whether or not bitcoin has reached its lowest price point this cycle, though it is the most positive move for the crypto market in nearly a year.\n\nFavourable market conditions could see bitcoin begin to recapture some of its losses in 2023, according to Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, who cites US inflation data in his forecast for the year ahead.\n\n\u201cWe are technically still in a bear market, but the signs are the bulls are beginning to take back control,\u201d Mr Green told The Independent.\n\n\u201cAs the central banks begin to stop tightening the screws, and the cyclical upturn gets underway, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin could outperform other asset classes. Knowing they are likely to be rewarded for doing so, many crypto investors are positioning themselves now for the pivot.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018crypto winter\u2019 is thawing amid growing signs that inflation is beginning to cool. Of course, the crypto market will not go in a straight line \u2013 no market ever does \u2013 but we expect the bears to go into hibernation and bulls are ready to run.\u201d"

        "content": "Along the Davos Promenade in 2023 there were fewer crypto companies than in previous years after the market crash. Circle, the company behind the stablecoin USDC, was one the few present.\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Over the past few years at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the number of cryptocurrency industry attendees has boomed.\n\nBut after a near $1.4 trillion wipeout in 2022, the crypto industry is being a bit more reserved with how it splashes the cash and several companies spotted last year are not in attendance. 2022 was marked by failed crypto projects, liquidity issues and bankruptcies, topped off by the collapse of major exchange FTX.\n\nWhen the World Economic Forum was held last May, bitcoin was hovering around $30,000, after having already fallen more than 50% from its all-time high hit in November 2021. More pain followed with bitcoin dipping as low as $15,480.\n\nThe Promenade is the main street in Davos where companies and governments take over shops and cafes for the week. Last year, crypto firms from all walks of life took over the place. But since the market slide, there are far fewer crypto firms with flashy store fronts at Davos.\n\nOne shop selling non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, has disappeared. Prices of NFTs, which are digital collectibles, also plunged last year. What's left are companies that survived the bear market and that are looking to expand their businesses.\n\n\"It's very clear that the speculation period is drawing to a close and every company that you see featured \u2026 is really focused on real-world use cases,\" said Teana Baker-Taylor, vice-president of policy and regulatory strategy at Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin."

        "title": "Here\u2019s what Bitcoin, Ethereum prices need for an explosive rally following US PPI release - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum prices rallied after US CPI data fell below expectations MoM, on January 12.\n\nEasing inflation indicates the Federal Reserve may reduce interest rate hikes, weighing on the US Dollar and helping cryptocurrencies.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Producer Price Index release could have a similar impact if data shows a drop in \u2018factory gate\u2019 prices.\n\nThe release of the latest US Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which measures factory gate price inflation, could significantly impact Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies when it is released at 13:30 GMT on Wednesday, January 18. The econometric is seen as a forewarner of more general consumer price inflation since it measures the cost of goods after production, or the \u2018wholesale\u2019 price.\n\nWill US Producer Price Index follow US CPI course?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices witnessed a recovery after the release of US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on January 12 showed an unexpected -0.1% fall in December on a month-over-month (MoM) basis. The data prompted a decline in the US Dollar and a rally in risk assets including many leading cryptocurrencies. This canceled out losses from the FTX exchange collapse and the DCG-Gemini scandal that have dogged the sector since November.\n\nThe question is, will the same thing happen when US PPI is released later today? And what exactly are the implications for cryptocurrencies from the data?\n\nAlso read: Will US CPI release whipsaw Bitcoin price to $16,500?\n\nUS PPI and CPI over the years\n\nEffect of PPI on the US Dollar and cryptocurrencies\n\nUS Producer Price Index is expected to come out at 6.8% on a yearly basis and -0.1% on a monthly basis for December, based on surveys of economists.\n\nThe greatest impact on the US Dollar and cryptocurrencies will result from an unexpected rise in PPI. This is because market expectations are tilted towards expecting lower inflation, especially after December Consumer Price Index showed an unexpected decline during the same month, therefore a rise would take the market by surprise.\n\nImportant US economic data releases expected on Wednesday\n\nIf the US Producer Price Index reading is significantly higher than the consensus (more than 0.1% MoM or 0.2% YoY) then this could result in a substantial rally in the US Dollar and a fall in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices. This is because it will mean the US Federal Reserve (Fed) may have to continue to implement aggressive interest rate hikes to curb inflation and this will support the US Dollar which is inversely correlated to cryptocurrencies (because they are priced in US Dollars).\n\nIf the PPI data meets consensus expectations, asset prices will probably remain largely unaffected, though there may be a slightly positive impact on the US Dollar and a negative impact on cryptocurrencies since the official survey expectations are now a bit out-of-date and do not factor in recent data, such as the below-expected CPI data released six days ago, on January 12.\n\nA below-expectations result, especially if it is greater than the 0.1% divergence seen in the CPI release, would likely result in a fall in the value of the US Dollar and a rally in Bitcoin, Ethereum and many other altcoin prices.\n\nWhat is the Bitcoin chart saying before the release?\n\nBitcoin price has risen sharply in January 2023, after plummeting to new lows following the FTX crisis last November. The leading crypto has rallied from $15,479 on November 21 to a new high of $21,594 on Tuesday, January 17 (yesterday).\n\n\n\nThere are indications the short-to-medium trend has changed for Bitcoin, after the break above the critical November 5 high $21,473, the last lower high before BTC bottomed, achieved this week. This break is a major sign the broader downtrend could be reversing.\n\nBTC/USD price chart\n\nOn its way up in January, Bitcoin price has broken above all the key moving averages: the 50, 100 and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), and this is a further sign it could be reversing its longer-term downtrend.\n\nBTC is overbought, however, according to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which is currently well above 70 on the daily chart. RSI can remain in overbought states for some time before the market starts pulling back and, according to Welles Wilder, the market technician who designed the indicator, it is not until it has exited overbought and re-entered neutral territory, below 70, that a firm signal to sell can be inferred. Whilst it is in overbought, however, Wilder advised traders not to add to their longs. On the 4-hour chart above, however, the RSI has already fallen below 70, providing traders with a sell signal, and suggesting the possibility of a pullback on that timeframe.\n\nA lower-than-anticipated or same-as-expected PPI, therefore, would certainly fall into line with the bullish narrative reflected in the charts, however, given the asset is already overbought, it could also have no effect or even a slightly bearish impact if the data continues to show lingering inflation. Prices rarely rise in a straight line and BTC price is certainly overdue a little correction."

        "content": "Photo by CHIP SOMODEVILLA / GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / Getty Images via AFP\n\nTucker Carlson, a Fox News host who has often been controversial, has proposed a theory that links airline delays in the U.S. and Canada with an increase in the value of Bitcoin. He suggested that the computer malfunction causing the delays may have been caused by a ransomware attack and that the U.S. government may have purchased a significant amount of Bitcoin to pay the ransom. However, he did not present any proof to support his claims.On his Fox News segment \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\", Carlson claimed that there is a correlation between the widespread airline delays in the U.S. on Jan 11 and the sudden increase of over 20 percent in the value of Bitcoin on the same day. He suggested that the government may have been buying large amounts of Bitcoin to pay a ransom for a possible ransomware attack that caused the delays, and also said that since the nationwide stop, the price of Bitcoin has shot up about 20 percent. He questioned if that was a coincidence.The theory proposed by Tucker Carlson, linking the airline delays and the increase in the value of Bitcoin, has been met with scepticism and criticism by the crypto community. Nick Almond, the founder of FactoryDAO, described the theory as \"maximum tin foil\" and doubted that the U.S. government would buy billions of dollars in Bitcoin on the open market to pay for ransoms. Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, also mocked the theory on Twitter, stating that the two events were simply a coincidence and not related.Critics of the theory on Crypto Twitter have made other arguments against it, including that the U.S. already has a large amount of confiscated BTC, that it would buy it OTC (over the counter) if it did buy it, and as BTC is traceable and transparent, a big amount of ransoms is more likely to be paid in Monero. Stack Hodler, a crypto analyst, suggested to his followers that the recovery of $5 billion by FTX was a more plausible explanation for the upsurge in crypto markets."

Discover SCENE\n\nLooking to bridge the gap between Web3 and mobile gaming, mobile payment firm Zebedee and mobile game studio Viker announced on Wednesday the launch of two new play-to-earn games, Bitcoin Chess and Bitcoin Scratch, a digital scratch-card game.\n\nLaunched in October 2019, Zebedee is a Bitcoin-focused gaming infrastructure company that releases Bitcoin-centric games through its mobile app. Bitcoin Chess and Bitcoin Scratch are the latest in a line of games launched with London-based Viker.\n\n\u201cImplementing rewards with Zebedee\u2019s platform isn\u2019t about players earning money, it\u2019s about creating a more interesting and fun experience,\u201d Dan Beasley, Co-Founder of Viker, said in a news release. \u201cEarning these tiny rewards simply feels great, regardless of if it\u2019s small amounts that won\u2019t materially impact most people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nZebedee says both Bitcoin Chess and Bitcoin Scratch are now available on iOS and Android.\n\nWhile the trading price of a single Bitcoin is well in the thousands of dollars, games that allow players to earn Bitcoin typically pay out in satoshis, or sats, named after the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, and the smallest denomination of the coin. To cash out, players enter their Zebedee account into Viker\u2019s app, where the gameplay takes place, to withdraw their earnings to the Zebedee app.\n\n\u201cThese are not large amounts of money, though, with players earning a few cents per session, which is what makes the concept sustainable,\u201d the company added.\n\nIn July 2022, Zebedee raised an additional $35 million in funding after raising $11 million in Series A funding in September 2021. Zebedee and Viker have already released mobile Solitaire and Sudoku games that give players a chance to earn Bitcoin. That same year, Zebedee launched a private server for the first-person shooter game, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, implementing an unofficial Bitcoin integration.\n\n\u201cEssentially, players receive a revenue share from the game, meaning Viker splits what they\u2019re earning from the game with the player,\u201d Zebedee said in a statement. The company says this model creates a more engaging player experience, leading to better retention and ultimately making the game more profitable.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese games have a massive global audience that mostly doesn\u2019t care about Bitcoin. And we\u2019re not asking them to,\u201d Zebedee Chief Strategy Officer Ben Cousen said in the release. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s Bitcoin, except for the fact that what we do simply isn\u2019t technically possible with traditional currency.\u201d\n\nIn September, Zebedee partnered with adtech startup Slice to implement Bitcoin lightning network payments in return for viewing browser ads after installing the Slice browser extension, a concept made popular by the Brave browser."

        "content": "Bitcoin price trades strongly above the $20,000 psychological level and shows signs of another upside move above $21K. Five on-chain indicators also signal that Bitcoin has entered an early bull market cycle.\n\nThe crypto market recovered slightly after the U.S. DOJ enforcement action against Russian crypto exchange Bitzlato. Crypto Twitter blames DOJ for creating much hype surrounding small news that caused panic selling across the crypto market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFive On-Chain Indicators Indicate More Upside in Bitcoin Price\n\nAccording to on-chain data by CryptoQuant, Bitcoin price has entered the early bull market cycle and is likely to move higher with promising momentum in the next few days.\n\nBitcoin movements from spot to derivative exchanges have increased as investors started taking risks. Traders generally transfer their coins to derivative exchanges to increase their market upside exposure. It helps them make more profits during a market recovery.\n\nThe MVRV Ratio indicates if the Bitcoin price is undervalued or overvalued. It is derived from Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization (market price) divided by its actual market capitalization. Currently, MVRV is 1.07 and moving near the 365-day moving average (orange line). Thus, it indicates Bitcoin is about to start a new uptrend.\n\nThird indicator, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss shows the average profit margin of Bitcoin holders. It is also near the 365-day moving average and indicates an early bull market cycle.\n\nPuell Multiple is the ratio of the daily dollar worth of newly issued bitcoins to their one-year moving average. At present, the indicator shows a shift to a positive trend as Bitcoin price holds strongly above its 365-day moving average.\n\nCryptoQuant\u2019s P&L Index indicator combines the MVRV ratio, Net Unrealized Profit/Loss, and LTH/STH SOPR into a single Bitcoin value indicator. The P&L Index points to an early Bitcoin bull market cycle as the index (dark purple line) looks to cross the 365-day moving average (light purple line)\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Really Bottomed? Use These To Confirm Market Bottom\n\nBTC Price Await Upside Momentum\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price fell nearly 2% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $20,774. The 24-hour low and high are $20,541 and $21,564, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased by 21% in the last 24 hours, indicating an increase in interest.\n\nTraders should keep an eye on the US dollar index (DXY). A fall in the DXY below 102 at current market conditions will confirm a rally in Bitcoin price.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Linked With Exchange Accused Of Money Laundering"

This kind of digital ledger is designed to be difficult to alter or hack and enables the creation of a public record of transactions.\n\nHe said: \u201cBlockchain is a ledger system that we use to move information... to move money. It's a technology we think will be deployable.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to CNBC, Mr Dimon added he could envisage the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates above 5pc as central bankers grappled to get a hold of raging inflation.\n\nMr Dimon said: \u201cI actually think rates are probably going to go higher than 5pc. There's a lot of underlying inflation, which won't go away so quick.\u201d\n\nThe US Federal Reserve has predicted rates will rise from around 4.5pc to about 5pc by the end of the year, and remain there.\n\nMr Dimon's comments on Bitcoin come as financial institutions emerge red faced from the failure of FTX, the world's second largest cryptocurrency exchange, which collapsed amid allegations of fraud.\n\nFinancial giants including Blackrock and venture capital fund Sequoia had invested in the digital currency exchange, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nMr Bankman-Fried has been arrested and accused of \u201cmassive\u201d fraud by US authorities. He is alleged to have siphoned customer money to pay for luxury properties and to prop up losses at a crypto hedge fund. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nLast year, the price of Bitcoin plunged by more than 60pc amid a sell-off of cryptocurrencies accelerated by a series of scandals and collapses throughout the digital asset industry.\n\nHowever, so far in 2023 the price of the digital currency has recovered. One Bitcoin is now worth \u00a316,880, up 23pc since the start of January."

        "content": "Members of a Blackpool gang have been handed jail sentences following a \u00a320 million Bitcoin fraud.\n\nLancashire Police welcomed the sentencing and said those involved stole so much money that they struggled to spend it.\n\nThe fraud began in 2017 when James Parker (below), who lived in a council flat in Blackpool, discovered a glitch in an Australian cryptocurrency trading website which allowed him to steal money.\n\nHe and his co-conspirators siphoned off more than \u00a320m worth of credits over a three-month period. Parker\u2019s corrupt financial adviser Stephen Boys, who earned the nickname \u2018Rodney\u2019 from Only Fools and Horses, helped launder the stolen funds.\n\nThe scam made so much money that \u00a35,000 gift cards were handed out to people in the street and cars were bought for people Parker met in the pub.\n\nDuring the trial Boys told the court how he took \u00a31m cash in a suitcase to buy a villa from Russians he met in the back office of an estate agent and paid \u00a360,000 to pay off corrupt officials so he could carry on laundering money.\n\nWhen fellow fraudster Kelly Caton rang police to report that her daughter had stolen 15 Bitcoin, the suspicions of officers led to the investigation.\n\n\u201cIt made us wonder \u2018how does this lady who lives in modest circumstances, a very small rented home in Blackpool, possess such hidden wealth?\u2019,\u201d Det Sgt David Wainwright, of Lancashire Police\u2019s Fraud Unit, told BBC North West Tonight.\n\nHe added that the gang \u201cstruggled to spend the money\u2026 the wealth they came across was probably too much for them to comprehend themselves.\u201d\n\nDuring the investigation police recovered 445 Bitcoin, then worth \u00a322m, along with luxury watches, houses, cars and designer goods, including a \u00a3600 wine cooler, along with more than \u00a31m in bank accounts. Police said the value of any assets will be returned to the victims.\n\nLancashire Police worked closely with international law enforcement, including in Australia and Finland, and the Crown Prosecution Service to bring the gang to justice.\n\nDet Sgt Wainwright stated: \u201cThe scale of the fraud in this case is absolutely staggering and led to the suspects literally having more money than they could spend.\n\n\u201cI would like to pay tribute to all the agencies who worked closely together to bring these people to justice.\u201d\n\nParker died in 2021 before he could be prosecuted but the other fraudsters were convicted last year and sentenced on Friday last week.\n\nBoys was given six years for converting criminal property. Caton and Jordan Robinson each got four-and-a-half years for conspiracy to commit fraud, two years for acquisition of criminal property and two years for converting criminal property.\n\nJames Auston-Beddoes was sentenced to one-and-a-half years for conspiracy to commit fraud, one year for acquisition of criminal property and one year for converting criminal property.

        "content": "Looking to bridge the gap between Web3 and mobile gaming, mobile payment firm Zebedee and mobile game studio Viker announced on Wednesday the launch of two new play-to-earn games, Bitcoin Chess and Bitcoin Scratch, a digital scratch-card game.\n\nLaunched in October 2019, Zebedee is a Bitcoin-focused gaming infrastructure company that releases Bitcoin-centric games through its mobile app. Bitcoin Chess and Bitcoin Scratch are the latest in a line of games launched with London-based Viker.\n\n\u201cImplementing rewards with Zebedee\u2019s platform isn\u2019t about players earning money, it\u2019s about creating a more interesting and fun experience,\u201d Dan Beasley, Co-Founder of Viker, said in a news release. \u201cEarning these tiny rewards simply feels great, regardless of if it\u2019s small amounts that won\u2019t materially impact most people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nZebedee says both Bitcoin Chess and Bitcoin Scratch are now available on iOS and Android.\n\nFinal Fantasy Maker Square Enix Backs Bitcoin Gaming Startup Zebedee in $35M Round\n\nWhile the trading price of a single Bitcoin is well in the thousands of dollars, games that allow players to earn Bitcoin typically pay out in satoshis, or sats, named after the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, and the smallest denomination of the coin. To cash out, players enter their Zebedee account into Viker\u2019s app, where the gameplay takes place, to withdraw their earnings to the Zebedee app.\n\n\u201cThese are not large amounts of money, though, with players earning a few cents per session, which is what makes the concept sustainable,\u201d the company added.\n\nIn July 2022, Zebedee raised an additional $35 million in funding after raising $11 million in Series A funding in September 2021. Zebedee and Viker have already released mobile Solitaire and Sudoku games that give players a chance to earn Bitcoin. That same year, Zebedee launched a private server for the first-person shooter game, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, implementing an unofficial Bitcoin integration.\n\nStory continues\n\nNo Big Deal: ZEBEDEE Contributes to Bitcoin Lightning Network Open Source Development\n\n\u201cEssentially, players receive a revenue share from the game, meaning Viker splits what they\u2019re earning from the game with the player,\u201d Zebedee said in a statement. The company says this model creates a more engaging player experience, leading to better retention and ultimately making the game more profitable.\n\n\u201cThese games have a massive global audience that mostly doesn\u2019t care about Bitcoin. And we\u2019re not asking them to,\u201d Zebedee Chief Strategy Officer Ben Cousen said in the release. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s Bitcoin, except for the fact that what we do simply isn\u2019t technically possible with traditional currency.\u201d\n\nIn September, Zebedee partnered with adtech startup Slice to implement Bitcoin lightning network payments in return for viewing browser ads after installing the Slice browser extension, a concept made popular by the Brave browser."

        "content": "width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nThe Bitcoin SV (BSV) blockchain aims for a billion transactions per second, for less than one-thousandth of a U.S. cent each\u2014\u201dthat\u2019s my value proposition,\u201d said Dr. Craig S. Wright at the Global Forum 2022 / Shaping the Future conference in Muscat, Oman, in October. Introducing Bitcoin to an audience who may have only limited prior knowledge of its capabilities, Dr. Wright said the blockchain is \u201ca provable measurement and metric of what exists and where.\u201d\n\nThe Global Forum is billed as \u201cthe Davos of ICT\u201d and \u201cThe International Think-Tank on the Digital Future\u201d and has been held annually for the past 30 years. This year marks its first event in the Middle East, with the theme \u201cTechnology, Sustainability, and Humanity,\u201d and it gathers over 250 international experts, policymakers, private and public companies and organizations, academics, and non-governmental organizations from over 30 countries.\n\nMuscat, Oman, was recently selected as the third Arab Digital Capital. Oman is aiming to be a technological testbed to find new efficiencies in various industrial sectors, with its \u201cVision 2040\u201d initiative.\n\nDr. Wright spoke on the opening panel with OPAL Oman Chief Executive Officer Abdul Rahman Al Yahyaei; H.E. Dr. Ali Al Shidhani from Oman\u2019s government; Giles Babinet, Co-president of the National Digital Council, Digital Champion, France; and Jean-Yves Le Gall, former President CNES, and President of the French Space Agency. He also spoke at length later in the conference to expand on his points.\n\nMore cost-effective than anything available now\n\nIntroduced by moderator Daniel Van Lerberghe as the inventor of Bitcoin, his first remark was to assure the audience that \u201cBitcoin is not an anarchist system,\u201d and that it worked within laws to create a network of digital ownership that fights crime and corruption equally, providing a transparent and permanent ledger of events in a way that\u2019s far more cost-effective than any data service available today.\n\nCentral to Bitcoin\u2019s technology is the idea of digital scarcity, he said. It\u2019s about turning real-world and digital assets and linking them to technology to create a single file that can exist only once. Transferring it does not copy the file but instead moves it to a new owner. This also presents the possibility of having multiple signatures required to move a file, provable deletion of keys, and the knowledge that one copy of the file is the only one in existence.\n\nHe described his past experience as an auditor to explain how Bitcoin is based on paper ledgers, where information and changes can be added, but none may be deleted. He cleared up possible misconceptions that the answer to correcting errors was \u201crolling back the blockchain\u201d or (in a swipe at BTC) that these functions could be performed on a network that only allows seven transactions a second.\n\nBitcoin firmly establishes property rights, he added, and people who own goods need to know they\u2019re still there and they can get them back (if stolen or lost). But \u201cmy answer isn\u2019t all this anarchist stuff,\u201d he said, and such a system requires the ability for people to manage it, like governments and courts.\n\nOman\u2019s digital Vision 2040\n\nDr. Ali Al Shidhani, Oman\u2019s Undersecretary for Communications and Information Technology (MTCIT), opened the panel discussion with a description of his country\u2019s digital vision. Vision 2040, he said, is an aspirational 20-year plan to put Oman \u201con the map \u201cof competing countries for economic diversification and human development.\u201d It\u2019s a \u201ctop-down, bottom-up\u201d collaborative approach with input from over 40,000 individuals and aims to increase efficiency and accelerate development through digitization.\n\nThis is important to Oman as it looks to diversify its economy away from reliance on natural resources, into other sectors like tourism and logistics, without ignoring key industries like mining. He said Oman was ranked by United Nations as among the top 50 on its e-government index, top 20 for cybersecurity, and top 48 for network readiness.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re banking on digital transformation to increase the efficiency of those sectors,\u201d he added.\n\nOman has created free development zones with physical space to test new technologies like transport and self-driving vehicles, while the government itself is working to develop new investment incentives.\n\nWatch: Marhaba: BSV blockchain in the Middle East\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "In April 2022, about the same time that Founders Fund sold out of most of its cryptocurrency holdings, Mr Thiel said he was optimistic about the future of bitcoin. He told a cryptocurrency conference in Miami that \u201cwe\u2019re at the end of the fiat money regime\u201d and suggested its price \u2013 which was then trading at about $US44,000 \u2013 could increase by a factor of 100.\n\nMr Thiel said JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon and BlackRock boss Larry Fink \u201cneed to be allocating some of their money to bitcoin\u201d, adding: \u201cWe need to push back on them.\u201d\n\nThe price of bitcoin, which was launched in 2009, surged dramatically from roughly $US750 in 2014 to an all-time high of more than $US65,000 by November 2021. However, its price has been volatile in recent years, with several big collapses in value, including a drop to about $US15,500 in November last year, a two-year low.\n\nThe digital assets market has been rocked by a crisis since May last year, forcing high-profile crypto companies such as Terraform Labs, Celsius, Voyager and Three Arrows Capital into bankruptcy.\n\nMarket sentiment towards crypto was damaged further in November when FTX, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, shut down owing creditors more than $US3 billion, and its co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried faced multiple fraud charges.\n\nBy December, bitcoin had lost about three-quarters of its value from its peak and more than $US2 trillion had been wiped off the value of the global crypto market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral blue-chip Silicon Valley investors have piled into digital currencies in recent years, although most have focused their investments on equity stakes in crypto businesses rather than buying cryptocurrencies directly.\n\nSome exceptions to this include A16z crypto \u2013 the crypto arm of venture firm Andreessen Horowitz \u2013 which raised a $US4.5 billion fund last year and also invests directly in crypto coins and tokens.\n\nSimilarly, Paradigm, a crypto venture firm founded in 2018 by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang, raised a $US2.5 billion fund in late 2021.\n\nBut many large financial institutions stayed away from cryptocurrencies over fears about cybersecurity and their links to money laundering and drug trafficking. In 2017, JPMorgan\u2019s Dimon called bitcoin a \u201cfraud\u201d.\n\nFounders Fund\u2019s shift on crypto, which had been one of its core positions, was one of about nine big exits the venture fund made between 2020 and the end of last year that allowed it to return roughly $US13 billion to investors.\n\nOther exits also included the initial public offerings of companies it had backed since their early fundraisings, such as Airbnb and Palantir, the data analytics group that Mr Thiel co-founded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Thiel co-founded PayPal in 1998 and went on to become one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most successful investors, including being the first venture capitalist to back Facebook.\n\nFounders Fund has more than $US11 billion under management, including $US5 billion of capital raised across two funds last year, and has taken stakes in more than 100 companies, such as Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, ride-hailing app Lyft and defence tech group Anduril.\n\nThe fund is in talks to take an equity stake in OpenAI, the developer behind chatbot ChatGPT, at a valuation of $US29 billion.\n\nFinancial Times"

        "title": "What are perpetual futures contracts in cryptocurrency? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What are perpetual contracts? The trading of perpetual contracts is comparable to that of futures contracts; however, in the case of perpetual contracts, the trader has more leverage and does not immediately exchange the underlying assets. Futures contracts, a type of derivatives instrument, postpone payment and delivery until predetermined future dates, whereas spot contracts are for immediate buying and selling. In contrast, a perpetual contract (which is a type of futures contract) lacks a fixed settlement time and an expiration date. As long as the maintenance margin is sufficient, traders can hold their long or short positions perpetually. The minimal amount of collateral a user must have in order to maintain open trading positions is known as maintenance margin. Let\u2019s understand the difference between traditional futures contracts and perpetual contracts through an example. In the case of a futures contract, Alice\u2019s January crude oil futures contract, which she bought for $70 per barrel, is due at expiration regardless of price. As an alternative, if she buys a perpetual contract, she consents to buy crude oil at a later time at $70 per barrel. This guarantee, however, is not time-bound, and she has the option to exit the position whenever she wants and reclaim her margin.\n\nWhat are perpetual futures? In 1992, economist Robert Shiller proposed a cash-settled futures market called perpetual futures that don\u2019t expire and don\u2019t provide delivery or coverage of the traded asset in order to lower the cost of rolling over or directly holding cryptocurrency contracts. However, such contracts are active only in cryptocurrency markets. In order to gain exposure to an underlying asset or index, a trader can own a perpetual futures contract indefinitely. Since the contracts wouldn\u2019t have a predetermined maturity date, this strategy allows for the creation of futures markets for illiquid assets. Furthermore, unlike equity futures, which are settled by delivering the asset at contract maturity, perpetual futures are always settled in cash \u2014 i.e., physical delivery. In addition, as there is no asset delivery, perpetual futures facilitate trading with high levels of leverage. Leverage is a trading instrument that investors can use to increase their exposure to the market by enabling them to use borrowed funds provided by the broker to make a trade or investment. Investors can hedge (mitigate risk) and speculate (increase exposure to price movements) on cryptocurrencies with high leverage by using perpetuals, which don\u2019t require taking delivery of any crypto asset and don\u2019t require rolling them over. In essence, perpetual futures are a contract between long and short counterparties, where the long side must pay the short side an interim cash flow known as the funding rate, and the short side should give the long side some reward based on the futures price\u2019s entrance and exit times. Perpetual futures contracts\u2019 prices are kept consistent with market values for the underlying assets they follow thanks to the funding rate mechanism. Funding takes place every eight hours \u2014 i.e., at 04:00 UTC, 12:00 UTC and 20:00 UTC. Traders can only pay for or get funding if they have a position at one of these times. The premium and interest rate make up the funding rate, which is determined based on the market performance of each instrument. Except for contracts like BNBUSDT and BNBBUSD, whose interest rates are 0%, Binance Futures\u2019 interest rate is set at 0.01% per funding interval (0.03% per day). The premium, however, fluctuates based on the price distinction between the perpetual contract and the mark price, which represents the fair value of a perpetual futures contract and is an estimation of a contract\u2019s true value when contrasted to its actual trading price. Moreover, profits and losses are regularly marked to market and credited to each side\u2019s margin account, and both parties are free to enter the arrangement at any time. Marking to market refers to pricing the cryptocurrency asset or any other security at the prevailing current market rate. Variations in an asset\u2019s market value cause traders\u2019 daily settlement of profits and losses. In addition, due to the lack of staggered trading of contracts with various maturities on the exchange and the trading of a single perpetual futures contract for each underlying asset, this configuration increases the contract\u2019s liquidity.\n\nHow do perpetual futures contracts work? When the contract price is higher than the price of BTC, users with short positions are paid the funding rate, which is reimbursed by users with long positions, causing the contract price to realign with the price of BTC/USD. BitMEX, a cryptocurrency exchange that deals in cryptocurrency derivatives, has popularized perpetual contracts like XBTUSD (Perpetual Bitcoin Contract). Using this contract, traders can create leveraged positions that rise or fall in value in response to changes in an index price that represents the United States dollar spot price of Bitcoin (BTC) as determined on a number of different cryptocurrency exchanges. Index price is the average price of an asset, which is determined by the size of major spot markets and the number of trades on those markets so that traded prices are equal to or extremely close to spot market prices. Let\u2019s take a hypothetical example to understand how perpetual futures work. Assume that a trader has some BTC. When they purchase the contract, they either want this sum to increase in line with the price of BTC/USD or move in the opposite direction when they sell the contract. Considering that each contract is worth $1, if they purchase one contract at the price of $50.50, they must pay $1 in BTC. Instead, if they sell the contract, they get $1\u2019s worth of BTC at the price they sold it for (it still applies if they sell before they acquire). It is important to note that the trader is purchasing contracts, not BTC or dollars. So, why should you trade crypto perpetual futures? And how can it be certain that the contract\u2019s price will follow the BTC/USD price? The answer is via a funding mechanism. Users with long positions are paid the funding rate (compensated by users with short positions) when the contract price is lower than the price of BTC, giving them an incentive to purchase contracts, causing the contract price to rise and realign with the price of BTC/USD. Similarly, users with short positions can purchase contracts to close their positions, which will likely cause the price of the contract to increase to match the price of BTC. In contrast to this situation, the opposite occurs when the price of the contract is higher than the price of BTC \u2014 i.e., users with long positions pay users with short positions, encouraging sellers to sell the contract, which drives its price closer to the price of BTC. The difference between the contract price and the price of BTC determines how much funding rate one will receive or pay.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of perpetual futures contracts? Perpetual futures offer high leverage to traders without constantly readjusting their positions and hedging their risks in margin and spot trading. However, such financial instruments are unregulated, meaning that victims are not protected, and defaulters may not be penalized for misconduct. Perpetual futures trading allows traders to buy or sell an underlying asset without a pre-specified delivery date, reducing the need to repeatedly create a long or short position. However, due to the absence of an expiration date, the counterparty risk is high in the case of such financial instruments. Moreover, perpetual futures contracts are not authorized by the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which means, in the case of default, the victims won\u2019t get compensated. In addition, because the value of the contract and the underlying asset automatically converge as the expiration date approaches, in the case of traditional futures, there is no need to maintain a price peg. However, the requirement to tie perpetual contracts to the current market values of the assets they represent makes them complex trading products. Regardless, when the market swings against active orders and open positions, traders can obtain an additional hedge with perpetual futures contracts to limit their risks in margin and spot trading."

        "content": "Crypto market shows signs of life as Bitcoin jumps over 20 per cent \u2013 but what\u2019s behind it?\n\nOver the weekend the BitcoinAtlantis conference took place in Madeira. Here, many of the Bitcoin thought-leaders gathered to discuss the future of the growing $1+ trillion asset.\n\nBitcoin investors are enjoying a stellar start to the year as prices in the flagship cryptocurrency rebound from historic lows seen after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November.\n\nThe value of Bitcoin has leapt 22 per cent this week alone, with Bitcoin now valued at over $21,000, compared to $15,000 in November.\n\nThe recent spike follows a more gradual increase in which the currency\u2019s value has climbed by over $1,000 in the opening two weeks of the year.\n\nA rebound in prices follows a torrid year for investors in which over $1 trillion was wiped from the value of the market, particularly after FTX filed for bankruptcy, sparking fears of contagion across the market.\n\nAnalysts said today more positive inflation prints in the US and the prospect of easing rate hikes from the Fed had helped spur a rebound in the value of Bitcoin this year.\n\n\u201cWith CPI coming in line with forecasts and showing a slowdown in headline inflation, this perhaps gives more confidence to the market that the Fed may not have to be as aggressive with future rate hikes, or finish rate hikes at a lower terminal rate, and that the bottom is potentially in for markets,\u201d Simon Peters, an analyst at EToro, said.\n\nPeters added that the investors cashing in hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of short positions around a dip in prices may have also helped fuel the recovery.\n\nFinancial commentator Susannah Streeter told City A.M. today the bounce will provide some respite for Bitcoin backers after a turbulent twelve months in the market.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s bounce higher will come as relief for speculators who saw the value of their holdings decimated as many others abruptly left the market and newcomers were scared away,\u201d she said.\n\nSoaring inflation and broader market volatility ushered in a so-called \u2018crypto winter\u2019 last year, wiping out\n\ninvestors\u2019 holdings and clearing space for scammers to flood the market.\n\nRecent data found three-quarters of Bitcoin millionaires lost their fortunes, while the number of scams rose by over 27 per cent."

        "content": "\"How can I make money with Bitcoin in Nigeria in 2023?\" This may be your question and I have answers for you. Bitcoin is a digital currency that has been gaining popularity in recent years. It is also known as a cryptocurrency and operates independently of a central bank or government. In simple terms, it is a form of digital money that can be sent and received electronically, similar to how you would send and receive money through your bank account.\n\nNow, let's talk about Nigeria. As you may already know, Nigeria is a country in West Africa with a population of over 200 million people. In recent years, interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been on the rise in Nigeria. This is because more and more people are becoming aware of the potential benefits that come with using digital currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nThe purpose of this blog article is to explore different ways you can make money with Bitcoin in Nigeria in 2023. Whether you're new to Bitcoin or have been following it for a while, this post will help you understand the different opportunities available to you and how you can take advantage of them.\n\nThe truth is, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can seem intimidating and confusing at first. But, with a little bit of knowledge and the right approach, anyone can start making money with Bitcoin in Nigeria. In this blog post, I'll be breaking down the most popular and effective ways to make money with Bitcoin in Nigeria, so you can decide which one is right for you. From buying and selling Bitcoin to trading and mining, I'll cover it all.\n\nSo, whether you're looking to make a quick buck or want to build a long-term investment portfolio, this post will provide you with the information and resources you need to get started. So, let's dive in and explore the exciting world of Bitcoin and how you can make money with it in Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\n\nSix Bitcoin business opportunities in Nigeria in 2023\n\n1. Buying and Selling Bitcoin\n\nBuying and selling Bitcoin can seem like a daunting task, but it's actually quite simple once you understand the basics. Bitcoin is a digital currency that can be bought and sold on various online platforms.\n\nFirst, you'll need to create an account on a platform that allows you to buy Bitcoin. Some popular options include Binance, Localbitcoins, and Nairaex. Once you've created an account, you'll need to verify your identity and link a payment method. This can be a bank account or a debit/credit card.\n\nOnce your account is set up and verified, you can start buying Bitcoin. The process of buying Bitcoin is similar to buying anything else online. You'll need to select the amount of Bitcoin you want to buy and then complete the purchase using your linked payment method. It's important to note that the price of Bitcoin can fluctuate greatly, so it's a good idea to keep an eye on the current price before making a purchase.\n\nOnce you have Bitcoin, you can then choose to hold onto it or sell it. To sell your Bitcoin, simply use a crypto platform that sells Bitcoin at the highest rates. A good recommendation is Breet App.\n\nBreet App\n\nBreet App is notably the best crypto trading app to sell Bitcoin in Nigeria at the highest crypto rates. You'll then be able to select the amount of Bitcoin you want to sell and complete the transaction. The money will then be credited to your linked Naira bank account in seconds.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that buying and selling Bitcoin carries some level of risk, as the value of Bitcoin can be quite volatile. So, it's important to do your research and understand the risks before making any investment.\n\n2. Trading Bitcoin\n\nTrading Bitcoin can be a great way to make money in Nigeria, but it can also be risky. To trade Bitcoin, you will need to buy it first and then hold onto it in the hopes that its value will go up. If it does, you can sell it for a profit. But if the value goes down, you could lose money.\n\nWhen it comes to trading Bitcoin, the key is to have a strategy and stick to it. You should also pay attention to the news and events that could affect the value of Bitcoin, such as changes in government regulations or major companies announcing they will accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\nOne popular strategy for trading Bitcoin is called \"day trading.\" This involves buying and selling Bitcoin within the same day, trying to make small profits each time. Day traders often use technical analysis to make decisions on when to buy and sell. This is a method of studying charts and patterns to try and predict future price movements.\n\nAnother strategy is called \"swing trading.\" This involves holding onto Bitcoin for a period of a few days to a few weeks, looking to make larger profits. Swing traders also often use technical analysis, but they may also pay attention to broader market trends and news events.\n\nIt's important to note that trading Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency for that matter, is highly speculative, and it can be risky. It is not recommended for individuals who are not well-versed in financial markets and have no experience with trading. It's always a good idea to start small and invest only what you can afford to lose.\n\nBefore you start trading Bitcoin, it's also a good idea to learn as much as you can about the different exchanges and platforms that are available. Each one has its own fees, features, and risks. It's also important to make sure you have a secure way to store your Bitcoin, such as a hardware wallet.\n\n3. Mining Bitcoin\n\nMining Bitcoin is the process of using specialised computer hardware to verify and record transactions on the Bitcoin network. In return for their work, miners are rewarded with newly created Bitcoins. It's important to note that mining Bitcoin is not the same as buying or trading Bitcoin. It's a way to earn Bitcoin by contributing to the network's security and stability.\n\nWhen someone makes a transaction using Bitcoin, that transaction is broadcast to the entire network. Miners then pick up these transactions and group them into blocks. These blocks are then added to the existing chain of blocks, called the blockchain. This process is called \"mining.\"\n\nTo mine Bitcoin, you need specialised hardware called an ASIC miner. These machines are specifically designed for the task of mining Bitcoin and are much more efficient than a regular computer. They can be costly to purchase, so some miners join a mining pool, where they work together with other miners to increase their chances of earning Bitcoin.\n\nThe process of mining Bitcoin is also resource-intensive, and it requires a lot of electricity. This is why many miners are located in areas with cheap electricity, such as China. However, with the advent of renewable energy, some miners are now located in areas with abundant solar or wind power.\n\nWhen a block is mined, the miner who mined it is rewarded with newly created Bitcoins. This reward is called the block reward, and it is currently set at 6.25 Bitcoins per block. The block reward is also halved every 210,000 blocks, which happens roughly every 4 years. This means that the number of new Bitcoins created each day will decrease over time. This is done to keep the total number of Bitcoins in circulation from getting too large.\n\nMining Bitcoin can be a profitable endeavour, but it's not for everyone. It requires a significant investment in hardware and electricity, and the difficulty of mining increases over time as more miners join the network. Additionally, the price of Bitcoin can also be volatile, which means that the value of the Bitcoins you mine can fluctuate greatly.\n\n4. Accepting Bitcoin as Payment\n\nAccepting Bitcoin as a form of payment for goods and services can seem daunting at first, but it's actually quite simple and can offer many benefits for your business.\n\nFirst, let's explain what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is a digital currency, or cryptocurrency, that allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority. It's decentralised and operates on a technology called \u201cBlockchain\u201d.\n\nNow, let's talk about how your business can start accepting Bitcoin as payment in Nigeria. The first step is to set up a reliable Bitcoin wallet that allows you to easily receive Bitcoin and quickly exchange it for cash. Breet App is a reliable Bitcoin wallet to accept BTC as a payment option for your business, which is like a digital bank account for your Bitcoin. There are many different types of wallets available, including software wallets that you can download to your computer or mobile device, and hardware wallets that are like USB drives.\n\nNext, you'll need to display your Bitcoin address, which is like a bank account number, on your website or in your store so customers can send payments to you. With Breet App you do not have to do anything, there are many features to allow businesses to conveniently accept Bitcoin. One of the features is \u201cAutomatic Settlement\u201d which automatically converts every crypto you receive to cash and immediately sends it to your linked bank account.\n\nThere\u2019s also a crypto rate calculator that businesses can use to calculate how much Bitcoin your customer should pay in equivalent to its Naira value.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of accepting Bitcoin as payment is that it can attract new customers who are looking for businesses that accept this form of payment. And because Bitcoin transactions are decentralised, there are no transaction fees, which can save your business money. Additionally, Bitcoin transactions are fast, meaning that customers don't have to wait for the payment to clear like they would with traditional methods.\n\nAnother benefit of Bitcoin is that it's borderless, meaning that you can accept payments from anyone in the world, opening up new possibilities for your business.\n\nIt's important to note that the value of Bitcoin can be quite volatile, so it's a good idea to convert the Bitcoin you receive into your local currency as soon as possible to avoid any potential losses.\n\n5. Buying and Holding Bitcoin\n\nNow, onto buying and holding Bitcoin. The basic idea is to purchase Bitcoin at a lower price and then hold onto it until the price increases, at which point you can sell it for a profit. This is similar to how you might invest in stocks or real estate, but with Bitcoin, you have the added benefit of it being a global currency that is not subject to the same economic and political pressures.\n\nSo, how do you buy Bitcoin in Nigeria? There are several ways to do this, but the most popular is through online exchanges. Once you have your Bitcoin, you will want to store it in a safe and secure wallet. This can be a physical wallet or a digital wallet, but it is important to make sure that it is a reputable and secure option.\n\nNow that you have your Bitcoin, the key is to hold onto it for as long as possible. This means not selling it at the first sign of a price increase, but instead, holding onto it for the long term.\n\nIt's important to note that the price of Bitcoin can be very volatile, so it's important to be patient and not make impulsive decisions based on short-term price fluctuations.\n\n6. Microtasks\n\nMicrotasks are small, simple tasks that can be completed online in exchange for payment. And one of the ways to get paid for these tasks is using bitcoin.\n\nIf you're looking for ways to make money with bitcoin, doing microtasks is a great option. Not only is it easy to do, but you can also get paid quickly and securely.\n\nSome examples of microtasks include:\n\nTaking surveys\n\nTranscribing audio or video\n\nModerating online forums\n\nCategorizing images\n\nTesting websites or apps\n\nTo start making money with bitcoin through microtasks, you'll first need to sign up for a bitcoin wallet. This is where you'll store your bitcoin and receive payments. There are many different wallet options available, such as Coinbase or BlockFi, so be sure to do your research and choose one that works best for you.\n\nOnce you have a wallet set up, you can start looking for microtasks to complete. Websites like Amazon Mechanical Turk and Clickworker are great places to start. These sites connect you with companies and individuals who need help with small tasks, and you can choose from a variety of tasks to complete.\n\nWhen you complete a task, you'll be paid in bitcoin. The amount of bitcoin you earn will vary depending on the task, but it's typically a small amount. However, you can do multiple microtasks to earn more bitcoin.\n\nIt's important to note that microtasks are not a get-rich-quick scheme. You won't make a lot of money doing them, but they can be a great way to earn some extra cash on the side. Plus, since you're getting paid in bitcoin, you have the potential to earn more as the value of bitcoin increases.\n\nConclusion: 6 Ways To Make Money With Bitcoin In Nigeria 2023\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin is a digital currency that has the potential to provide many opportunities for making money in Nigeria in 2023. We've discussed six different ways to make money with Bitcoin, including buying and selling, trading, mining, accepting it as payment, and investing in various opportunities.\n\nEach of these methods has its own benefits and challenges, and it's important to do your own research and understand the risks of cryptocurrency investment before diving in. However, if you're willing to take the time to learn about Bitcoin and these different methods, the potential rewards can be significant.\n\nOverall, Bitcoin is a digital currency that has the potential to provide many opportunities for making money in Nigeria in 2023.

Bitcoin mining is best started using the bitqt platform.\n\nThe behavior of Bitcoin in the digital financial market makes the other digital currencies follow in its footsteps, assuming if it all rises and if the opposite is the case, they all move after the first in cryptographic market capitalization.\n\nThe collapse of prices during 2022 has been abrupt, leading Bitcoin to a price that decreased more than 60% from its last historical maximum registered in 2021, which has undoubtedly reduced the other digital instruments, even leading them to disappear.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nBitcoin characteristic volatility\n\nBefore the latest bitcoin and cryptocurrency price surge, in a survey of mostly bank executives, Forbes found that most thought bitcoin and digital assets could replace fiat currencies like the US dollar in the next five or ten years.\n\nOn the other hand, other financial analysts warn that there is still a long way to go before cryptocurrencies have a massive adoption that makes them huge as a unit of account and currency of exchange, as well as a store of value.\n\nThis process began to accelerate, mainly after the decision of the payment company PayPal to incorporate Bitcoin as a means of payment. Later, several firms, including Tesla, began to flirt with Bitcoin as a payment currency.\n\nAt the same time, we must not fail to highlight the environmental challenges, considering the high energy consumption required by mining currencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nIt should be remembered that the price of the leading crypto assets tends to experience high volatility despite showing a long-term upward trend.\n\nBlockchain and central banks\n\nThe modernization of traditional banking is under pressure due to the versatility and security offered by the blockchain in terms of recording and monitoring of operations, where no one can alter them, which has led these institutions to consider the creation of digital currencies to diversify their service portfolio and streamline international processes to compete with the cryptocurrency model.\n\nWe could be facing a scenario of updating traditional banking, where the processes could be more transparent, less cumbersome, and without so much bureaucracy involved, as well as the opportunity is given to users to be the owners of their capital without the possibility of executing a transaction is in the hands of third parties.\n\nArticle continues below this advertisement\n\nIt is projected that the euro and the digital dollar will not replace each other\u2019s fiat currency; they will only complement the need to make electronic payments.\n\nBitcoin is a market capitalization that came out of nowhere\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies have the potential to become an alternative asset class, their prices are likely to remain highly volatile and attract more speculative investors, the Swiss Financial Services Company (UBS) noted.\n\nMassive dollar liquidity and network effects are the most substantial headwinds against Bitcoin\u2019s rise, Voorhees told Decrypt, noting that Bitcoin has gone from nothing to a trillion-dollar market cap for a decade. . \u201cBitcoin is gaining its network effect over time,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are still many people who do not know what cryptocurrencies are, and even more who have heard of them but do not understand them; only when this happens Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency will have taken over.\n\nBitcoin is here to stay, leading the digital cryptocurrency market, demonstrating year after year how its volatility has shown it to have incredible value and still without knowing how much it will be worth in a few years.\n\nConclusions\n\nAll this has created significant uncertainty, and for this reason, it has come to be thought that it can replace one of the most important currencies in the world, but to achieve this goal, a massive adaptation to a new digital world must occur market for many, uncertain for others.\n\nIt is not as easy as it is said, but every day we are more on the path to transcending a digital world controlled by this crypto-asset market.\n\nAt the moment, it is hard to assume that cryptocurrencies can replace the dollar or any other strong currency on the market; however, it does not have any support; It is the currency that countries recognize as par excellence.\n\nOver the years, electronic transactions will continue to replace the use of physical money, where cryptocurrencies will act to position themselves as the digital currency par excellence."

        "title": "Bitcoin To Reach $161,800, According To Fibonacci Extension, Elliott Wave Theory | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Bitcoin price is struggling to maintain above $20,000 per coin \u2014 a level that few expected the top cryptocurrency to trade at ever again once it passed the key resistance the first time.\n\nIn a new prediction, the next target for BTCUSD might also reach a level that very few at this point would consider or expect. However, ages-old mathematics and Elliott Wave Theory could suggest the next cycle may possibly peak much sooner than many would believe \u2014 and at price of $161,800 per coin.\n\nFinding Price Targets With The Mysterious Power Of Fibonacci\n\nCryptocurrency traders commonly use Fibonacci retracements and extensions to make decisions about where and when to buy or sell. It isn\u2019t known why prices tend to gravitate toward these levels, but the ratios are found all throughout the natural world.\n\nFor example, Venus orbits the sun in 224.6 days, while Earth at 365.2 days. This creates a ratio of 8/13 \u2014 both Fibonacci numbers \u2014 which is roughly 0.618. This is precisely why the golden ratio is also referred to as the divine proportion. It\u2019s almost magical.\n\nFib ratios are derived from the Fibonacci sequence \u2014 a series of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers. The sequence reads 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.\n\nAlthough the sequence is named after the famous Italian mathematician who popularized it, its use dates back to 200BC Indian mathematics. Simply put, this is about as ancient of math as it gets.\n\nBTC reached the 1.618 Fibonacci extension several times during the cycle | CME-BTC! on TradingView.com\n\nExamining Market Cycles With Elliott Wave Theory\n\nRalph Nelson Elliott developed Elliott Wave Theory in the 1930s, yet the study could be the key to figuring out what\u2019s going on with Bitcoin.\n\nElliott Wave Theory believes that market cycles move in five primary waves, with waves one, three, and five moving with the trend, and waves two and four moving against it as corrective phases.\n\nRelationships with Fibonacci are everywhere in Elliot Wave Theory. Impulse waves up tend to fizzle out at Fib extensions, while corrections terminate at Fibonacci retracement levels and extensions.\n\nA five-wave motive wave completes one cycle in five individual waves with three impulses and two corrections. A complete Elliott Wave sequence consists of 21 movements and there are 21 total corrective patterns. Each of the numbers are Fibonacci numbers.\n\nBitcoin's fifth wave might be about to begin | CME-BTC! on TradingView.com\n\nWhy Bitcoin Could Reach $161,800 Per Coin\n\nWith all that background out of the way, we can focus on Bitcoin price. As a speculative asset, it\u2019s especially susceptible to emotion-driven price movements, making it especially responsive to Fibonacci ratios and Elliott Wave Theory.\n\nUsing the BTC CME Futures chart, it is possible to count out a Bitcoin Elliott Wave motive wave still in progress. If the wave count is accurate, it\u2019s possible to project a possible end to the motive wave and bullish cycle by using a Fibonacci extension target.\n\nBitcoin price could reach the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, which is roughly $161,800 per BTC. Interestingly, if you multiply $100K by the golden ratio, you\u2019ll get $161,800. The top cryptocurrency touched the golden ratio target at the 2021 peak when Fibonacci extensions are drawn from the very open of the BTC CME chart to the 2018 bear market bottom.\n\nThe target is contingent on Bitcoin price having ended its wave four expanded flat correction and started its wave five impulse. While wave fives tend to match wave one in magnitude and strength, they can also mimic wave three \u2014 which tends to be the longest and strongest.\n\nIn Search Of Cyclical Confirmation In Crypto\n\nIn the video above, Tony \u201cThe Bull\u201d walks step-by-step through each wave count in Bitcoin and uses textbook Elliott Wave examples to explain how the price action could develop.\n\nIn the exclusive in-depth analysis, each wave terminates at a key Fibonacci level, dating back to the beginning of the Bitcoin bear market. Using a channeling technique to project the next cycle peak, it is possible that the bold target is reached within the next six months to a year.\n\nFinally, the cyclical nature of BTC is possibly further confirmed using Hurst Cycle Theory, which suggests a near-perfect cyclical rhythm of bottoming since 2015. Each major bottom also took place within a logarithmic buy zone and each cyclical top in its sell zone.\n\nThe Fisher Transform is then used to possibly provide confirmation of the presence of yet another significant turning point in BTCUSD \u2014 and possibly the last bullish impulse before the cycle comes to and end.\n\nAs an Elliott Wave partner, I\u2019m able to share FREE State of the Global Markets report access (normally $263) from Elliott Wave International: https://t.co/FEfEGiej72 This 19-day event includes new reports every 2 days & 50+ forecasts on #Bitcoin, gold, stocks, oil, bonds, etc. pic.twitter.com/ZU9JmbSMFt \u2014 Tony \"The Bull\" Spilotro (@tonyspilotroBTC) January 19, 2023"

        "content": "After OpenAI presented its text-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT, it has become all the rage lately, thanks to its ability to generate responses to users\u2019 queries very close to those of a real human, covering a wide range of topics.\n\nIndeed, global Google searches involving the keyword \u2018ChatGPT\u2019 have spiked in January, with China ranking as the region with the highest search interest in the platform, whereas the United States isn\u2019t among countries recording increased demand.\n\nAs it happens, one task in which ChatGPT might be exceptionally useful, is gathering and presenting to users the predictions of possible price movement ranges of digital assets on the cryptocurrency market, such as Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nWith this in mind, Finbold has asked the ChatGPT chatbot to share expectations concerning the price movements of Bitcoin in 2023 and toward its end, using indicators such as historical data, price chart patterns, and technical analysis (TA) gauges.\n\nWhat did ChatGPT say?\n\nInterestingly, ChatGPT admitted that \u201cit is impossible to predict the exact price of Bitcoin by the end of 2023, as the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and unpredictable.\u201d That said, it did present bullish expectations of Bitcoin, citing historical data, charts, and gauges:\n\n\u201cHowever, based on the chart patterns, gauges, and previous data available, it is likely that Bitcoin will trade within a range of $50,000 to $100,000 by the end of 2023.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the projections of the AI-powered platform are in line with predictions of Bitcoin enthusiasts who believe that the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset is well on its way toward wider adoption and an increased price in 2023.\n\nWhen it comes to longer-term predictions, i.e. by 2030, ChatGPT didn\u2019t offer any specific numbers, citing high market volatility and government regulations, but acknowledged that \u201cBitcoin will likely become more widely accepted, and its value will continue to rise.\u201d\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s price at press time stood at $21,256, recording an increase of 0.30% on the day, as well as growing 21.91% across the previous seven days, and adding up to the cumulative gain of 26.92% on its monthly chart, as per the data retrieved on January 18.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart.

        "content": "JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has continued to express his disapproval of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies after he last year compared Bitcoin to a \u201cPonzi scheme.\u201d\n\nDuring an appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box on January 19, Dimon was questioned about his most recent stance on cryptocurrencies. In response, he asked the panel why they \u201cwaste any breath\u201d discussing the subject before taking a dig at the flagship digital asset, \u201cBitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud, a pet rock.\u201d\n\nAlthough talking about the qualities of blockchain and ledger technology that JPMorgan thinks can be deployable as money, he questioned whether Bitcoin really is a store of value or as scarce as it\u2019s supposed to be.\n\n\u201cHow do you know it [Bitcoin] is going to stop at 21 million? Maybe it\u2019s going to get to 21 million, and Satoshi\u2019s picture is going to come up and laugh at you all.\u201d\n\nDimon\u2019s reaction to FTX collapse\n\nThe JPMorgan CEO also admittedly revealed he was \u2018not surprised at all\u2019 by the failure and subsequent bankruptcy of FTX, once one of the leading crypto exchanges in the world, \u2018I called it a decentralized Ponzi scheme.\u2019\n\nDebated about saying whether cryptocurrency technology itself is a decentralized Ponzi scheme and what happened to FTX are two different things to which he replied.\n\n\u201cYou guys have all seen the analysis of Tether and all these things, the lack of disclosures, its outrages. Regulators should have stopped this a long time ago. People have lost billions of dollars if you look at its lower-income people, in some cases retirees.\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cCrypto itself doesn\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s a pet rock, and you can own it all you want. I don\u2019t care about Bitcoin, so we should drop the subject.\u201d\n\nDimon is known to be a major skeptic of cryptocurrencies, having previously called Bitcoin a \u2018fraud.\u2019 Despite Dimon\u2019s criticism of Bitcoin, JPMorgan allows transfers to buy crypto and is actively involved with incorporating blockchain into its services. For instance, the lender has its token dubbed JPM Coin for intraday repurchase agreements. While in December, the bank officially registered a cryptocurrency wallet trademark.\n\nFeatured image via NBC News YouTube."

        "content": "After a brief bullish rally, the general cryptocurrency market has again woken up in a sea of red, and Bitcoin (BTC) is down more than 2%, leading to less optimistic expectations of the crypto community about the future price of the maiden digital asset.\n\nIndeed, the votes cast by the members of the crypto tracking platform CoinMarketCap project that Bitcoin will be changing hands at the average price of $19.368 on January 31, 2023, according to the data retrieved by Finbold on January 19.\n\nShould the estimations of 19,438 member votes prove true, it would mean that the price of Bitcoin by the end of January will decline further by -6.64% or -$1,377 compared to its current value, which at press time stood at $20,745.\n\nBitcoin social average price prediction.

        "title": "Want to mine Bitcoin using solar panels? Here's how many you'll need - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Mining is one of the most popular ways for individuals and organizations to earn cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) through passive income, but critics have often drawn attention to the energy used up in the process of transaction verification using the Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm.\n\nWith this in mind, crypto YouTuber Drew Vosk has looked into a more ecologically acceptable way to produce electricity for Bitcoin mining \u2013 solar panels \u2013 and has analyzed the numbers in a video published on his channel on January 18.\n\nCrunching the numbers\n\nThe basic formula to calculate how many solar panels are needed for a mining rig includes taking one\u2019s monthly electric usage, dividing it by monthly peak sun hours, and multiplying the result by 1,000. Then, the resulting number is divided by the power rating of the solar panel.\n\nFormula to calculate how many solar panels are needed to mine BTC. Source: VoskCoin\n\nPutting this in practice, an Antminer S19 uses 72 kWh per day, which multiplied by 30 days equals 2,160 kWh per month. This number is then divided by the number of monthly peak sun hours, say 156, which gives 13,84. Multiplying this by 1,000 results in 13,846 watts.\n\nThen, taking a standard 400-watt solar panel, this number is divided by 400, which gives 34.6. Rounded off, this means 35 solar panels are needed to run one mining rig. In other words, you would need a 14kWh solar system to mine Bitcoin using solar power.\n\nVosk also advises keeping in mind that how much energy one can earn from the sun varies with their location on Earth. For example, this would never be feasible in London, United Kingdom, as nearly twice as many solar panels would be needed due to its weather.\n\nCostly endeavor\n\nIn the United States, 15kWh of solar panels costs $31,191 thanks to the tax breaks on buying them (without tax breaks, this number would be $42,150). In terms of return on investment, $31,000 to power one Bitcoin miner 24/7 would be a rather expensive endeavor.\n\nTo put this into perspective:\n\n\u201cAt 10 cents per kWh, you could pay your electric company 10 years at current rates to operate this miner instead of setting up the solar panels. When you deal with solar energy, we\u2019re talking years \u2013 not months, not weeks, definitely not days \u2013 as far as ROI, break-even,\u201d Vosk said.\n\nHowever, the crypto YouTuber also believes that \u201cnothing is cooler than generating your own electricity\u201d and \u201cwhen you throw the electric waste argument out the window when it comes to crypto and especially mining, well, then it\u2019s truly a beautiful and powerful, indisputable thing.\u201d\n\nBut is it profitable?\n\nThat said, setting up a solar power system for a farm of 10 mining units would cost about $258,000. Right now, the break-even period would be projected to be about 10 years. Running 25 units would require about $645,000 in the solar setup, and an investment of $1,790,000 would be needed to deploy 50 mining units. However, the monthly mining income from this would be about $29,730.\n\nFor instance, an innovative and eco-friendly Bitcoin mining pool, PEGA Pool, offers miners that use renewable energy only 1% mining fees, which is half of the industry standard of 2%, thus increasing mining profitability.\n\nAlthough Vosk admits that solar-powered Bitcoin mining would take a long time to break even, he stresses to \u201ckeep in mind Bitcoin\u2019s low \u2013 all you need to do is \u2018hodl\u2018 some coin, things go decently, and that number will dramatically decrease,\u201d as well as that \u201call Bitcoin all-time highs have been preceded by a new Bitcoin halving.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the first solar-power Bitcoin mining plant in South Australia has recently opened, providing about five mW of electricity in an effort to curb the carbon footprint of mining the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset.\n\nIn March 2022, Finbold reported on Peter Egyed, also known as AZ Hodl, installing an off-grid solar array to power his Bitcoin mining operation and shared the results of his findings, according to which he expected to make an ROI within 36 months.\n\nWatch the entire video below:"

        "content": "BTC price formed a double bottom pattern and have succeeded to breakout of neckline resistance at $18,385\n\nBitcoin crypto price had sustained above 50 day EMA but it is struggling to breakout of the 200 day EMA hurdle\n\nBTC price is showing signs of long term base formation near $20,000\n\nBitcoin price is trading with mild bullish cues and bulls are attempting to break out of the 200 day EMA. According to Coingalss, $21,000 strike price holds a Call open interest at 15.27K BTC and Put at 3.97K BTC which clearly indicates the strength of buyers. Currently, The pair of BTC/USD is trading at $20,821.76 with an intraday gains of 0.71% and the 24-hour volume to market cap ratio at 0.0745\n\nBTC price turned bullish and formed three white shoulder pattern\n\nSource : BTC/USD daily chart by Tradingview\n\nOn a daily time frame, BTC price had shown a surprising rally of 3000 points in a short span of time and formed a double bottom bullish reversal pattern. From the past couple of months BTC price got stuck in the narrow range between $15,500 to $18,000 and experts have turned highly bearish and are expecting more downside in the BTC prices but market chooses the opposite direction and shot up 32% approx from the lows.\n\nBTC price had succeeded to reclaim the 50 day EMA (yellow)which had reversed the short term trend in the favor of bulls but unfortunately the positional trend is still in the bear grip as prices struggled at the 200 day EMA(green). However, In the coming weeks, If BTC bulls will be able to break out of the 200 day EMA and $21,500 hurdle level we may see the next phase of rally in the short span of time which can take BTC to the $25,000 level\n\nAccording to technical analysis, BTC prices are expected to consolidate in the range between $18,500 to $25,000 in the coming months and if any minor correction triggers from the higher level, it will provide an opportunity for investors and traders to build fresh long positions. On the lower side $18,000 and $16,000 will act as a demand zone for investors. The MACD had generated positive crossover but the curve is sloping sideways denotes prices are lacking the momentum near the supply zone and the RSI at 78 denotes the overbought level.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin prices had shot up 30% from the lows and formed a three white shoulder bullish pattern which indicates the buyers dominance on the lower levels. The technical analysis suggests that BTC price may enter into the short term consolidation but eventually it will break out of upside. Therefore, traders may look for buying opportunities for the target of $25,000 and above by keeping $18,500 as SL. However if prices slipped below $18,500 bears may try to test $16,000 again.\n\nTechnical levels\n\nResistance levels : $21,500 and $25,100\n\nSupport levels : $18,000 and $16,000\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.
