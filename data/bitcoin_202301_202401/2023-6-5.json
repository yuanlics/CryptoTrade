Earlier, it fell as low as $25,368.57, its lowest level since March. Ether gained nearly 5% to trade at $1,896.19.\n\nOn Tuesday, the SEC filed a lawsuit in New York federal court alleging that Coinbase has been acting as an unregistered broker and exchange. The agency demanded that the company be \"permanently restrained and enjoined\" from continuing to do so.\n\n\"If there's a real value in these crypto tokens then compliance will build trust and the business model might change,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in an interview Tuesday with CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"What we're doing at the SEC is pro-innovation because the capital markets really don't work.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of work here for the crypto field but we stand ready to work to get them into compliance,\" he added."

The exchange did more than 10 times the volume of Coinbase, for example, in the past 24 hours, but saw $69 million in trading outflow after news of the SEC\u2019s lawsuit broke, per CoinDesk. Shares of Coinbase, the largest U.S. exchange, were down double digits.\n\nThe Commodity Futures and Trading Commission had previously sued Binance and Zhao in a separate case in March, alleging that the exchange knew it was \u201cviolating CFTC rules.\u201d Prices for some of the top cryptocurrencies similarly dropped after the suit became public.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance alleges similar findings, filing 13 charges against the exchange and Zhao, alleging an \u201cextensive web of deception\u201d and \u201cblatant disregard of the federal securities laws and the investor and market protections these laws provide.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we take the SEC\u2019s allegations seriously, they should not be the subject of an SEC enforcement action, let alone on an emergency basis. We intend to defend our platform vigorously,\u201d Binance said in a blog post on Monday. \u201cUnfortunately, the SEC\u2019s refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the commission\u2019s misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry.\u201d"

        "content": "A worsening macroeconomic climate and the collapse of industry giants such as FTX and Terra have weighed on bitcoin's price this year.\n\nCryptocurrency prices dropped Monday after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, with violating securities laws.\n\nBitcoin fell 5.5% to $25,662.50, its lowest level since March, according to Coin Metrics.\n\nEther slid 5.1% to $1,807.79. Binance Coin , a token used to pay transaction and trading fees on the Binance exchange, tumbled 9.5%.\n\nThe declines came after the SEC alleged Binance and its co-founder, Changpeng Zhao, comingled billions of dollars of investor funds with their own and violated securities laws. The complaint follows a similar one against Binance from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission earlier this year.\n\n\"Binance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume so it's no surprise that the market is responding the way it is to the news,\" Sam Callahan, lead analyst at bitcoin services company Swan Bitcoin, told CNBC. \"Any regulatory action against a major player in the cryptocurrency space creates uncertainty and leads to increased market volatility in the short term.\"\n\n\"However, such volatility is often temporary, and prices may recover once the market absorbs the news,\" he added. \"Long term this can be seen as a healthy development for the ecosystem as bad actors are cleansed out, and capital flows out of cryptocurrencies with significant regulatory risk and into bitcoin.\"\n\nThe suit is the latest development in this year's crackdown on the crypto industry by U.S. regulators. Since January, the SEC has charged Kraken, Genesis and Gemini Trust with offering unregistered securities to investors and has warned Coinbase of potential securities charges.\n\nBitcoin last week capped its worst month of trading since November, finishing May down 7.9% after trading in a narrow range of between $26,000 and $28,000. Technical analysts see $25,200 as the key level to watch for bitcoin on the downside."

Bitcoin began the day at $25,700 and dropped to a low of $25,400. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies sagged about 0.7%.\n\nIn the lawsuit against Coinbase, the SEC specifically detailed \u201ca non-exhaustive list\u201d of 13 cryptocurrencies that it argued were securities, including pages of details outlining these tokens\u2019 releases. The most prominent include Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC).

Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America\u2019s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance,\u201d said Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, in a statement shared with Fortune."

Gradient Ventures, a Google-backed venture capital fund, led a second round. Other participants were Mouro Capital, MS&AD, and Hudson Structured Capital Management.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile is sitting at the confluence of the A.I. and digital assets transformation,\u201d Anna Patterson, managing partner at Gradient Ventures, said in a statement. \u201cThe team has an opportunity to change how consumers use digital money and set a new standard for tech-enabled life insurance providers.\u201d\n\nThe capital raise, which values Meanwhile at $100 million, according to cofounder and CEO Zac Townsend, is just one of Sam Altman\u2019s recent investments at the intersection of crypto and artificial intelligence. Worldcoin, a project he helped found that aims to persuade billions of users to scan their irises to prove they\u2019re human, recently announced a funding round of $115 million.\n\nIn 2020, Townsend and cofounder Max Gasner decided to build a life insurance company that only collects and distributes Bitcoin\u2014\u201ca life insurance company for the crypto economy,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re believers that there will be this Bitcoin economy, and that this is going to grow over time,\u201d he added.\n\nSo he and Gasner, who share a background in fintech, set to work, eventually securing approval as a licensed and regulated life insurance company in Bermuda. (Meanwhile is not currently licensed or registered as a life insurance company in the U.S.)\n\nUsing A.I. to issue claims and evaluate the health risks of applicants, the firm, which has seven employees, only deals in Bitcoin. Customers pay monthly premiums in crypto, and claims are paid out in crypto. To make money, Meanwhile, like many other life insurance providers, lends out a portion of what\u2019s collected in monthly premiums and charges interest on the loans.\n\nUltimately, Townsend trusts his product with his life. He has, he told Fortune, taken out his very own Bitcoin life insurance policy."

Teng's knowledge and experience as a regulator will come to bear in his new role overseeing Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa as the exchange, often targeted by authorities, attempts to draw a line under mounting enforcement actions related to conduct during crypto\u2019s early years. Prior to heading up the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, Teng was chief regulatory officer of Singapore Exchange (SGX) and spent 13 years with the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

        "title": "IU researchers using Carbonate supercomputer to unveil the mysteries of cryptocurrency trading - IU Newsroom",
        "content": "The introduction of cryptocurrency to the marketplace in 2009 raised many questions for financial analysts, ranging from \u201cWhat is it?\u201d to \u201cHow will it affect the marketplace?\u201d When Bitcoin first became available to buy, sell, and trade on online exchanges the following year, nobody really knew what it would do to asset prices, like housing and stocks, or how to project what it might do in the future. Such projections help inform major decisions in both the micro and macro economies, from whether to buy a home or when to take a company public on the stock market.\n\nWhile crypto has been studied in the years since, analysts relied on observable factors, such as market value and past returns. IU researchers are taking it a step further, using data from the actual blockchain, which is essentially a secure and decentralized ledger of cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nPreetesh Kantak, assistant professor of finance, IU Kelley School of Business\u201cWe actually have the trading data for what we call off-chain activity, which is the trading that\u2019s happening on the exchanges,\u201d said Preetesh Kantak, an assistant professor of finance at the Kelley School of Business. \u201cWe want to see the interaction of the trading activity that\u2019s taking place on these exchanges and compare and contrast their impact on Bitcoin prices with actual blockchain activity.\u201d\n\nPeople trade Bitcoin using various exchanges, like Coinbase. Most people using exchanges are regular people and not large institutional investors, Kantak said. The ultimate holder of the Bitcoin on the blockchain is the exchange, and those exchanges have accounts, or wallets, on the blockchain that are holding coins for all those using the exchange to trade cryptocurrency.\n\nKantak said that preliminary findings from other studies using less precise data and observations seem to indicate that off-chain, or exchange, activity experiences a great deal of mean reversion, meaning price volatility and historical returns eventually revert to their long-term average levels. This is usually indicative of the exchanges managing their inventory risk, he said. By contrast, on-chain activity shows momentum, meaning Bitcoin prices typically go up.\n\nKantak and Xioran Cheng, a former Kelley student who first brought up the project idea as an independent study proposal, needed to be able to segment the activity on the blockchain into its various players to determine who is actually holding these coins. These entities could include an exchange, a mutual fund, or a large holder. By tracking on the blockchain how and when Bitcoin is traded, Cheng and Kantak can then see what these factors might mean for future asset prices. To do this, they needed to use Carbonate, IU\u2019s large-memory computer cluster that was designed to support data-intensive computing.\n\nIU Kelley School of Business student, Xioran Cheng\u201cThe process of downloading and uncompressing these massive files, then opening them, cleaning them up, and segmenting the data is a massive undertaking. The only way to do it is with a supercomputer.\u201d - Xioran Cheng\n\n\u201cThis is every transaction of Bitcoin going back to when Bitcoin started, so it\u2019s a huge amount of data, and it\u2019s all compressed in these files called BLK files,\u201d Kantak said. The BLK files contain numerous complications when it comes to extracting clean data, he said. For example, spoofing, which is when cybersecurity criminals pretend to be someone else for nefarious purposes, muddies the data. Also, a single user or organization can have multiple wallets, and they must look at how transactions are taking place between wallets and amalgamate them to attribute them to a single user. This will allow them to study the transactions and how such transactions affect asset prices going forward.\n\nThe process of downloading and uncompressing these massive files, then opening them, cleaning them up, and segmenting the data is a massive undertaking. The only way to do it is with a supercomputer, Cheng said.\n\nApart from the work of verifying or contradicting the outcomes of earlier studies, which they hope to finish by this summer, Kantak and Cheng are excited to see what else the exchange and blockchain data can tell them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more we\u2019d like to do between on chain and off chain,\u201d Kantak said. \u201cBut first we need to go through this segmentation process so that we know who is initiating what trading activity. Without Carbonate, we couldn\u2019t do this.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin Is Less Than a Year Away From a Much-Hyped Event That Has Historically Seen Its Price Soar - Nasdaq",
        "content": "***Money is not a client of any investment adviser featured on this page. The information provided on this page is for educational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice. Money does not offer advisory services.***\n\nThe crypto market has been laying somewhat low in 2023 compared to its massive price swings that made constant headlines in recent years.\n\nBut we\u2019re now less than a year out from an event that has historically seen bitcoin\u2019s price rise during the lead-up and aftermath: bitcoin halving, which happens once every four years.\n\nThe regular event limits the amount of new bitcoins that come to the market. Because of the historical gains around bitcoin halving, some investors are hoping that the next halving, expected in April or May of 2024, could spur the start of a crypto bull run (a period of prices going up). That would be welcome news for investors, given thatbitcoin prices\u2014 along with those of other financial assets, like stock prices \u2014 have taken a hit in the last year amid interest rates hikes and recession fears.\n\nBut can we actually expect a price boost as we head towards the next halving? Here\u2019s what crypto investors should know.\n\nWhat is bitcoin halving?\n\nBitcoin halving has everything to do with bitcoin miners, who are involved in the process of creating new bitcoins. That includes everyone from individual hobbyists to corporate enterprises, with anywhere from one to thousands of specialized computers. These computers work constantly at the singular task of solving mathematical problems for the bitcoin network. If a computer solves a problem, it is rewarded with the bitcoin that is minted as a result of its work.\n\nBitcoin halving causes the total reward that miners receive for their work to be slashed in half. Miners currently earn 6.25 bitcoin for solving a problem, but they will begin to receive only 3.125 bitcoin for their efforts after the halving. From its very inception, bitcoin\u2019s creator only ever intended for the supply to reach 21 million coins \u2014 and the goal of the bitcoin halving is to decrease the supply of new bitcoin overtime.\n\nMuch of the rhetoric around halving as a cause for a crypto rally has to do with this tightening of rewards. Many investors see the event as increasing scarcity of bitcoin and say it will inflate the coin\u2019s value because of supply and demand economics.\n\nBitcoin halving has historically come with price gains\n\nSo far, there has been a bitcoin halving in 2012, 2016 and 2020 \u2014 and each one has seen the price of bitcoin rise in the months before and after the event.\n\nFollowing the 2016 halving, for instance, bitcoin\u2019s price jumped to a record of nearly $20,000 per coin in 2017. In the year leading up to the May 2020 halving, bitcoin\u2019s price rose around 20%. Between the halving and the end of the year, bitcoin\u2019s price gained more than 200%.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of how bitcoin\u2019s price will do in the future, but there\u2019s already chatter about the halving\u2019s potential as fuel for a new price run.\n\nWill there be a crypto bull run?\n\nSome crypto experts are challenging the notion that the bitcoin halving is going to bring on a prolonged bull market. Crypto is still relatively new, so nothing should be taken as a certainty, says Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. He adds that when it comes to the bitcoin network, nothing changes for anybody during a halving except for miners: There\u2019s a misconception that the halving reduces the overall supply of bitcoin, but it really just reduces the amount of new bitcoin coming on the market, Malekan says. The plan is that there will still ultimately be 21 million coins, as was always intended. Plus, the halving is no surprise.\n\n\u201cYou would think [halving events] would be priced in long before the actual event and not have any material impact,\u201d Malekan says.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of back and forth about whether or not the halving is baked into bitcoin\u2019s price, and whether the fact that bitcoins are scarce make them more valuable. Morningstar senior research analyst Madeline Hume\u2019s recent analysis of bitcoin scarcity indicates that the argument that increasing the scarcity of new bitcoin pushes up its value is reductive. Hume notes that bitcoin looks on charts like its pricing operates in four-year cycles, which seems to indicate a correlation between scarcity and price increases. But she also notes that, excluding the \u201choneymoon periods\u201d that followed previous halvings, the relationship between the production of new bitcoin and prices is more or less negligible.\n\n\u201c[It could] be pure coincidence that bitcoin\u2019s halving cycles arrived just as narratives around crypto reached their frothy peaks, and the relationship is totally spurious,\u201d Hume says. She goes on to also say that a major flaw in these scarcity-based analyses is that they all predict bitcoin\u2019s price will keep going up, which is impossible to know.\n\nCould the bitcoin halving cause prices to drop?\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the bitcoin halving could actually cause the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to go down, Malekan says. The slashing of miners\u2019 rewards will make the practice less profitable and miners who are already struggling could be forced to shut down when their potential profits are cut in half, Malekan says. This could hurt the network\u2019s security since there would be fewer people monitoring activity.\n\n\u201cA lot of miners are suffering during this bear market and unless prices recover or fees go substantially higher, some will be forced to shut down once the block reward falls,\u201d Malekan says.\n\nIf there are gains, don\u2019t expect them to be long-lived\n\nHanna Halaburda, an associate professor at NYU Stern School of Business, says that post-halving gains are nothing more than hype, and that while prices may go up in the near-term, investors shouldn\u2019t expect a long-lasting bull market thanks to the halving alone.\n\n\u201cThe only real explanation for why the price goes up is that we start talking about bitcoin more,\u201d Halaburda says.\n\nThe halving, like many happenings in the world of crypto, gets a lot of social media chatter in its lead-up. Halaburda points to studies that say there is a relationship between social media posting and crypto price fluctuations. (Nowadays, a tweet from Elon Musk can send dogecoin\u2019s price soaring.) She adds that newer investors learning about the coin\u2019s limited new supply could help along a short-lived speculative rally, since they may have not been aware of the halving before.\n\nHalaburda also says investors need to keep in mind that the halving won\u2019t do anything to improve the use cases for bitcoin, which is ultimately what matters most for ensuring the longevity of the network.\n\nMore from Money:\n\n\u2018Free\u2019 Games Like Candy Crush and Counter-Strike Are Wrecking People\u2019s Finances\n\nCrypto Graveyard: Thousands of Coins Listed in Recent Years Have Already Failed\n\nStock Ownership Is at Its Highest Level Since 2008\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 Money Group, LLC.

These companies\u2019 support has thrown a lifeline to the fossil fuel industry and is impeding progress on efforts to curb emissions.\n\nFinancial institutions and the fossil fuel industry endanger our ability to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. The role of big banks and asset managers in driving the climate crisis is well documented, and campaigners have been pushing leaders in the financial services industry to align their portfolios with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, including by divesting from the fossil fuel industry.\n\nMost of these companies claim to be taking action on climate\u2013but at the same time, they provide financial support to energy-intensive Bitcoin mining companies. Bitcoin mining is keeping coal alive\u2013 it\u2019s responsible for reopening coal plants and uses as much energy as entire countries. And asset managers like Fidelity Investments, BlackRock, and Vanguard, and banks like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Citigroup, have substantial shares in Bitcoin mining. These companies\u2019 support has thrown a lifeline to the fossil fuel industry and is impeding progress on efforts to curb emissions.\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of verifying and recording transactions on a digital ledger. In this process, mining companies use thousands of specialized computers known as mining rigs that consume country-level amounts of electricity to guess the correct answer to a specific challenge. The first computer to guess correctly gains newly minted Bitcoins as a reward. The system adjusts as network processing power grows, making this number-guessing game more difficult. Miners compete to be the fastest, and those with the most computing power will increase their chances of gaining tokens. Miners are incentivized to keep electricity costs low to increase their profit margin.\n\nToday, miners\u2019 electricity demand rivals that of countries like Sweden. A one-megawatt mine uses more energy daily than a typical U.S. home in two years. According to research by WattTime, 85% of the energy miners use in the U.S. is from coal and natural gas plants, providing a solid lifeline to the fossil fuel economy. Globally, coal power is the number one source for energy hog Bitcoin. This fossil fuel electricity creates enormous climate pollution of nearly 66 MtCO2e per year, equal to Singapore\u2019s emissions. In the U.S. alone, meeting the power demands added by Bitcoin mining emits as much carbon pollution as 3.5 million gas-powered cars.\n\nWhile GHG emissions destroy our climate, communities living near these mining operations suffer immediately from air, water, and noise pollution. A recent New York Times investigation, The Real-World Costs of the Digital Race for Bitcoin, provides an in-depth overview of the environmental and utility ratepayer impact of Bitcoin mining companies, highlighting both the climate and local pollution.\n\nFollowing the investor money trail reveals that some of the largest U.S. asset management companies and banks have substantial shares in publicly-traded Bitcoin mining companies. As of April 2023, a Greenpeace analysis of data from the Bloomberg Terminal based on holdings and share prices reveals that the largest asset managers (BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard) and banks (Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and JP Morgan Chase) control shares across 24 Bitcoin mining companies in excess of $1.35 billion. Vanguard leads with the highest investment of over $615M, followed closely by BlackRock with nearly $600M. Fidelity tops the others with the most widespread shares across 22 mining companies. On the bank front, Goldman Sachs leads with $28M+ in shareholdings, closely followed by JP Morgan Chase with over $26M. JP Morgan Chase has investments across 17 mining operations.\n\nThese companies are blatantly ignoring Bitcoin\u2019s climate impact and air, water, and noise pollution despite having environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment criteria or net-zero climate goals. The pollution affecting people living near the mines is duplicitous to these goals. For example, Stronghold Digital, in which Vanguard, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Fidelity hold shares, uses toxic coal ash to directly fuel its electricity needs. According to EWG, Stronghold has two waste coal-fueled generating facilities: the 85 MW Scrubgrass Plant in Venango County, Pa., and the 80 MW Panther Creek Plant, in Carbon County, Pa. Before Stronghold\u2019s 2021 purchase of these coal plants, the plants were virtually non-operational with electricity generation and coal consumption reduced by 95 percent between 2014 and 2020. The waste coal that Stronghold burns for electricity is poor-quality coal discarded by previous coal-mining operations. This kind of coal has low energy content and high toxin levels. Burning waste coal is pollution-intensive, including carbon emissions, heavy metals, and air toxics that hurt communities closest to the mining facilities. Under Stronghold\u2019s ownership, the plant has burned 830 percent more waste coal compared to 2020, and in 2022 waste coal consumption was up by about 1,800 percent over 2020 \u2013 the most since 2014.\n\nVanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group, and Citigroup have invested over $700M in Riot Blockchain, with Vanguard and BlackRock leading the pack by far. Similar to other Bitcoin miners, Riot causes environmental and economic harm to residents living near the mines. The impacts include massive electricity and water use, utility rate hikes, and water, air, and noise pollution.\n\nA New York Times investigation also found that Riot Platforms is the largest emitter of climate pollution amongst other U.S. mining companies. Riot Platforms\u2019 excessive electricity use in Texas is largely fueled by coal power. Residents in Navarro County, TX, organized against Riot Platforms to stop the miner\u2019s role in consuming massive amounts of electricity, increasing rates for water and electricity for residents, increasing air pollution, and causing excessive noise pollution.\n\nHow can companies such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, and the others that have invested in Bitcoin mining reconcile that with company climate and ESG goals? Clearly, those in charge of the company\u2019s sustainability commitments cannot. These companies are turning a blind eye to these investments like other fossil fuel investments perpetuating climate chaos.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Asset managers and banks can publicly call for Bitcoin to change its code and reduce its electricity consumption by nearly 100%. These companies can also stop all fossil fuel investments, including those to climate-wrecking Bitcoin mining operations. If they care about keeping our planet livable, that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ll do."

        "content": "Who Controls Bitcoin?\n\nSince we know that fiat money is controlled by governments and banks, who controls Bitcoin is the next question. This is simply answered through its decentralized nature: nobody and everybody at the same time. There is no authority that makes\u2026\n\nSource: Freepik.com\n\nSince we know that fiat money is controlled by governments and banks, who controls a decentralized currency like bitcoin? The answer lurks in the word decentralized \u2013 which means that the Bitcoin network is managed by nobody and everybody at the same time.\n\nWho controls Bitcoin?\n\nBy definition, decentralize means \u201c to move the control of an organization or government from a single place to several smaller ones.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for the Bitcoin network, except instead of \u201cseveral smaller places,\u201d the control of the system is delegated to thousands of nodes \u2013 people who choose to run the Bitcoin software on their computers.\n\nNo central authority makes decisions in regards to the Bitcoin network; instead, everyone gets to call the shots. No one owns Bitcoin technology, so there is no hidden mastermind who controls Bitcoin.\n\nThe governance of Bitcoin\n\nIt is users around the world who control Bitcoin. Anyone is free to develop and improve the bitcoin software. Likewise, anyone is free to choose which version of the software they want to run. However, to make it a usable, network, users must come together and run compatible versions of the software. In the end, a strong network requires everyone to operate within the same rules, and that\u2019s how bitcoin consensus is reached \u2013 by the majority vote.\n\nThis is who controls Bitcoin: majority vote. Since all nodes in the network are equal, if the majority decides something, it will happen. And if you do oppose the change, you are free to join other systems (that\u2019s why there are so many bitcoin forks). The strongest network wins, and that\u2019s why most of the users, miners, and developers have an incentive to respect and protect this mutual agreement. It is in everyone\u2019s best interest to keep the network active, secure, and healthy!\n\nInfluence over the bitcoin network\n\nBut who controls the Bitcoin network? One might say that it is developers, who discuss how the system should be developed and improved. Others say it\u2019s the miners, who choose which version of the software they want to run. But again \u2013 it must be the majority who decides on the future of Bitcoin, as there are no nodes, or participants, that get any special or preferential treatment.\n\nSuch is the nature of genuinely decentralized organizations. And apparently, it works!\n\nCheck out our guide on \u201cwhat is bitcoin mining\u201d to learn more about how Bitcoin mining works."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell almost 6% and Ether lost 5% in a broad market fall by all top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies on Tuesday morning in Asia after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao on charges of securities violations. The BNB token issued by Binance was the biggest loser with a drop of more than 10% in the past 24 hours.\n\nTop 10 cryptos slide\n\nBitcoin dropped 5.66% over the last 24 hours to US$25,730 at 7:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, bringing losses over the past seven days to 7.23%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nEther fell 4.91% in the same period to US$1,808, and logged a 4.56% weekly loss.\n\nBNB skidded 10.21% to US$275.17 in the last 24 hours, losing 11.61% over the past week.\n\nThe SEC on Monday filed 13 charges against Binance, alleging the exchange made unregistered and unlawful offers and sales of its BNB and BUSD tokens. The SEC also alleged that Binance did not register Binance.com as an exchange or a broker-dealer clearing agency.\n\nIn response to the SEC lawsuit, Binance said in a Tuesday statement that it intends to defend its platform \u201cvigorously.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the Commission\u2019s misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry,\u201d Binance said.\n\nCryptocurrencies traded on the Binance exchange, including BNB, BUSD, Solana, Cardano\u2019s ADA, Polygon\u2019s MATIC, are securities and require registration and regulation, according to the SEC suit.\n\nSolana dropped 9.52% over the past 24 hours, with ADA falling 7.73% and MATIC losing 7.64%.\n\n\u201cThe total crypto market cap is down,\u201d Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock, told Forkast on Tuesday morning in Asia. \u201cThe fact that the news doesn\u2019t come as a shock doesn\u2019t mean that it was priced in, apparently.\u201d\n\nIn a Monday tweet, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in \u201can extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure and calculated evasion of the law.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIn response, Zhao tweeted: \u201cWonder if he ever reads the comments under his post, from the consumers he is [supposed] to protect.\u201d\n\nWonder if he ever reads the comments under his post, from the consumers he is suppose to protect. https://t.co/xQjC872GsD \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 Binance (@cz_binance) June 5, 2023\n\nAccording to d\u2019Anethan, the SEC\u2019s legal action is not a surprise considering the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission had earlier filed a lawsuit against Binance for alleged violations of trading rules for derivatives.\n\nHowever, traders see the lawsuit as extremely bearish and it\u2019s shaking up the market, he said.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 4.6% to US$1.09 trillion in the 24 hours through to 8:30am Hong Kong, while trading volume surged 118% to more than US$48 billion.\n\nApple headset bumps Binance in NFT market\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged down 0.17% to 3,295.91 in the 24 hours to 9:20 a.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance \u201chasn\u2019t had an impact on NFTs yet, but it likely will,\u201d Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News, said on Tuesday. \u201cIt has already impacted crypto, and usually NFTs lag behind just a bit.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S. overnight, Apple Inc. unveiled its highly-anticipated mixed-reality headset Vision Pro. While priced at a hefty US$3,499, the headset has got the NFT industry excited about its potential application in metaverse developments.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s headset is really all the NFT spaces was talking about today and rightfully so,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cReally, it\u2019s the single most important thing to happen to NFTs since CryptoPunks, even though Apple didn\u2019t mention NFTs or the metaverse once in their reveal of the Vision Pro.\u201d\n\nS\u00e9bastien Borget, co-founder and chief operating officer of decentralized gaming giant The Sandbox, said in a Tuesday interview with Forkast that Apple\u2019s headset is \u201copening a big field of opportunity\u201d for metaverse developments.\n\n\u201cThis has the highest chance of becoming a game changer versus everything we\u2019ve seen so far over the past five years in this field \u2026 allowing people to interact with their virtual assets in the physical world.\u201d\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum rose 5.64% over the last 24 hours to US$25.75 million, and gained 90.84% in the past week. Sales on the Bitcoin network climbed 4.17% to US$3.16 million, but recorded a 11.87% weekly decline.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Azuki remained the two most-sold Ethereum collections. BAYC had the biggest sales in the past 24 hours of US$7.26 million, followed by Azuki\u2019s US$2.65 million.\n\nDMarket, a Mythos blockchain-based collection of gaming NFTs, was the third most-sold collection over the past 24 hours with an 11.49% rise in sales to US$1.52 million.\n\nCoinbase shares hit by Binance\n\nImage: Coinbase\n\nShares of Coinbase, the largest crypto trading platform in the U.S., dropped 9.05% on Monday following the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance. Shares of MicroStrategy, the world\u2019s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, fell 8.53%.\n\nU.S. stock futures also moved marginally lower as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 0.05%, S&P 500 futures fell 0.04%. Nasdaq Futures fell 0.09%.\n\nCoinbase has its own legal battle with the SEC. In March, the SEC alleged Coinbase violated investor protection laws and threatened enforcement action against the exchange. Coinbase argued back in April that the SEC\u2019s move appeared to be undermining its own role as the monitor of companies registering to sell shares to the public.\n\nCoinbase has also requested a court to compel the SEC to publicly respond to the exchange\u2019s July 2022 petition asking for clearer crypto regulation guidelines.\n\nOn the regulation front, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, tweeted on Monday that he will testify on Tuesday before the House Committee on Agriculture on the need for clear crypto rules and on the Digital Asset Market Structure discussion draft released Friday.\n\n\u201cThe US is falling behind,\u201d Grewal tweeted. \u201cWe cannot afford to ignore crypto while other markets take advantage of our absence, developing rules and regulations that enable the industry to thrive and risk sending jobs, investment, and technological leadership overseas.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "By Euronews, AP and AFP\n\nAccording to a lawsuit filed by the US SEC, Binance and its founder have mishandled funds and violated US securities laws.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao have been accused of misusing investor funds, operating as an unregistered exchange, and violating a slew of US securities laws in a lawsuit filed by US regulators.\n\nFiled in a federal court in Washington DC, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit on Monday lists 13 charges against the firm - including commingling and divert customer assets to an entity Zhao owned called Sigma Chain.\n\nThe news caused Bitcoin, the largest crypto in terms of value in circulation - worth over $500 billion (\u20ac468 billion) - to plummet, losing almost 2 per cent in a matter of minutes.\n\nWhy is Binance in the dock?\n\nBinance is a Cayman Islands limited liability company founded by Zhao and the charges are familiar to practices uncovered after the collapse of the second largest cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, last year.\n\nThe lawsuit lays out the extent to which the firm's owners knew of the alleged legal violations, stating \"Binance\u2019s CCO bluntly admitted to another Binance compliance officer in December 2018, 'we are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro'\".\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler in a written statement that Zhao and Binance \"engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law\".\n\n\"The public should beware of investing any of their hard-earned assets with or on these unlawful platforms,\" Gensler said.\n\nIn a social media post, Binance said that it has been cooperating with the SEC's investigation but said that the agency \"chose to act unilaterally and litigate\".\n\n\"While we take the SEC\u2019s allegations seriously, they should not be the subject of an SEC enforcement action, let alone on an emergency basis. We intend to defend our platform vigorously,\u201d the company said in a Twitter post.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the SEC\u2019s refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the Commission\u2019s misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry\".\n\nNew blow for crypto after FTX collapse\n\nThe lawsuit comes roughly eight months after the collapse of FTX, which was also accused of co-mingling customers' funds and investing the proceeds in high-risk investments that customers were unaware they were participating in.\n\nUS prosecutors and the SEC charged FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried with a host of money laundering, fraud, and securities fraud charges in December. His criminal trial is likely to be in the fall.\n\n\"The new complaint from the SEC against Binance is a laundry list of charges laying out exactly the same claims that many in the Bitcoin and crypto communities have made against Changpeng Zhao and his companies for many years,\" said Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, a Bitcoin financial services company.\n\n\"These practices of Binance have essentially been open secrets, so no one who operates in the space will be surprised by any of the charges\".\n\nUS regulators have gone after Binance before.\n\nIn March, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed an enforcement action against Binance and Zhao in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois charging them with numerous CTFC violations.\n\nThe complaint also charges Samuel Lim, Binance\u2019s former chief compliance officer, with aiding and abetting Binance\u2019s violations."

Following on its mission to invest in renewable energy sources to support and promote sustainable Bitcoin mining, Tether will provide capital and bring its domain expertise in energy, hardware, and communications to build \u201cVolcano Energy\u201d, a 241 MW renewable energy generation park in Metap\u00e1n. By integrating solar and wind projects within the volcanic region, Tether aims to play a key role in paving the way for one of the world's largest Bitcoin Mining Farms.\n\nIn Central America, El Salvador has the highest geothermal energy production. Located in the El Chiste hamlet within the municipality of Metap\u00e1n, Santa Ana, the site chosen for this development will be divided between 169 MW of photovoltaic solar energy and 72 MW of wind energy.

        "content": "Bitcoin fell on Monday afternoon in Hong Kong to below US$27,000. Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours, with Litecoin leading losses, followed by Binance\u2019s BNB token. XRP gained the most, followed by Tron and Solana. Asian and European bourses mostly gained while U.S. stock futures traded mixed.\n\nSee related article: HK green lights retail crypto trading as Beijing releases Web3 white paper\n\nBitcoin, Ether slump\n\nBitcoin fell 1.73% from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, lowering its value to US$26,836, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Monday\u2019s depreciation contributes to a weekly loss of 3.85%. Over the past month, the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization reached a low point of US$25,878.\n\nEther, which is the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency, also experienced a drop in value. It fell by 1.41% to US$1,873, marking a weekly decline of the same percentage.\n\nOf the top 10 cryptocurrencies excluding stablecoins, Litecoin saw the largest drop over a 24-hour period, falling 2.43% to US$93.37. However, over the course of the past week, it gained 2.14%. The token\u2019s third halving event is set for Aug. 2, which is expected to reduce the network\u2019s block rewards.\n\nAccording to a recent report from digital asset researcher CCData, the sector experienced its first decrease in total assets under management for digital asset investment products in 2023. The overall AUM contracted by 8.92% to US$30.6 billion in May. The report added that May 2023 marked the first time in the year when Bitcoin and Ethereum products saw a decrease in AUM, declining by 10.3% and 4.42%, respectively.\n\nBNB, the native token of the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange Binance, fell by 1.88% to US$301.09 in the past 24 hours, part of a 4.28% decline in the last seven days. Richard Teng has emerged as the front-runner to lead Binance should its current chief executive Changpeng Zhao decide to step down amid regulatory hurdles, according to a Bloomberg report on Monday. The exchange faces regulatory scrutiny in the U.S., has suspended its Australian dollar services, and has ceased operations in Canada due to tightened crypto mandates.\n\nXRP, Solana and Tron gained among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos. XRP rose 1.79% to US$0.5343 in 24 hours, bringing its weekly gains to 11.07% after the XRP community reacted to the draft bill Digital Asset Market Structure Proposal released Friday by Republicans that seeks clarity in regulating cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities.\n\nSolana climbed 0.30% to US$21.66 while Tron\u2019s TRX token gained 1.15% to US$0.08151 in the last 24 hours.\n\nNFT sales edge higher\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.75% to 3,305.61 in the last 24 hours to 3.45 p.m. in Hong Kong, and is down 2.19% on the week.\n\nThe Forkast ETH NFT Composite index was down 0.65% to 1,113.45 in the same period, bringing its weekly losses to 1.11%.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum fell 14.45% to US$21.77 million, but gained 81.34% in the last seven days, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nSales on the Bitcoin network increased 49.36% in the last 24 hours to US$3.05 million but lost 4.59% on the week.\n\nAmong Ethereum collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) clocked the highest sales volume in the past 24 hours of US$4.53 million, followed by Azuki\u2019s US$2.75 million and Mutant Ape Yacht Club\u2019s US$1.58 million.\n\nSales volumes on the Bitcoin network were led by $OXBT BRC-20 NFTs, rising 40.73% to US$580,597 in 24 hours, followed by Bitcoin Bear Cubs, which rose 2.30% to US$530,830.\n\nSales of uncategorized Ordinals \u2014 Bitcoin NFTs that are not part of an established collection \u2014 climbed 75.68% to US$525,458.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of green to be seen on the seven-day NFT collection rankings by sales volume. A Bitcoin project is still king, but the reigning king of NFTs, BAYC, has had some significant sales this week, as some collectors are securing grails ahead of a possible entry by Chinese collectors,\u201d according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThe blockchains by NFT sales volume rankings show the battle for the third spot still raging on, with Solana holding it down at almost US$10 million in sales volume. Ethereum and Bitcoin are still top dogs, and nobody is expecting that to change anytime soon,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nAsian, European bourses gain, U.S. futures mixed\n\nMost Asian equity markets gained on Monday after U.S. President Joe Biden announced over the weekend that he signed the debt ceiling bill into law, averting a potential default in the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite gained 0.07%, while the Shenzhen Component Index dropped 0.47%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.84%, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 strengthened 2.20%.\n\nMajor U.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 6.15 p.m. in Hong Kong. The S&P 500 futures index was down 0.02%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures dropped 0.29%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 0.07%.\n\nCrude oil prices rose after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners (OPEC+) decided to reduce production by another million barrels per day starting in July. Output will decline to 9 million barrels per day from about 10 million in May, potentially adding to inflationary pressures by pushing up prices.\n\nEuropean bourses gained on Monday, with the benchmark STOXX 600 rising 0.05% while Germany\u2019s DAX 40 rose 0.14%.\n\nIn a speech last week, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde reportedly indicated that additional interest rate hikes were possible since it was unclear if core inflation in the eurozone had peaked. Most central banks around the globe, including the ECB and the U.S. Federal Reserve, have set 2% as a target inflation rate.\n\n\u201cFor the past two decades, central banks have struggled to push inflation rates up to their respective targets, with deflation fears dominating the balance of risk during the \u2018lowflation\u2019 period since the global financial crisis. Looking ahead, central banks are now more likely to struggle to avoid inflation from overshooting those targets,\u201d Azad Zangana, senior European economist and strategist at Schroders, said in a note on Monday.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is scheduled to meet on June 14 to decide on interest rates and the economy\u2019s trajectory. The interest rate in the U.S. is now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest level since 2006. Annual inflation in the world\u2019s biggest economy was below 5% in April, but above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\n\n\u201cThe Fed is almost certainly not done yet with interest rate hikes, especially following Friday\u2019s robust jobs report. Even if the central bank takes a pause this month, we do expect further rate rises are on their way before they bring their hiking program to an end,\u201d Nigel Green, chief executive of financial advisory firm deVere Group, said in a statement on Monday.\n\n(Update adds equity section.)"

        "title": "Pi Network vs. Bitcoin Network: A Comparative Analysis - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "Explore the comparative analysis between Bitcoin and Pi Network, two prominent networks shaping the future of decentralized finance. Uncover their differences in mining, scalability, market acceptance, and community dynamics.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nBitcoin and Pi Network are compared in terms of their foundational principles, mining methods, scalability, market acceptance, and community dynamics.\n\nBitcoin operates as a decentralized digital currency, while Pi Network focuses on accessible mining through mobile devices.\n\nBitcoin mining relies on computational power for security, while Pi Network utilizes a mobile mining approach with lower energy consumption.\n\nBitcoin faces scalability challenges, while Pi Network needs to address scalability as it aims for widespread adoption. Market acceptance and value differ between the two networks.\n\nCryptocurrencies have opened new avenues for financial transactions, decentralized networks, and innovative technologies. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known digital asset, has paved the way for a digital revolution.\n\nHowever, newer players like Pi Network are entering the market with unique propositions and aiming to challenge the status quo. This article will conduct a comparative analysis of Pi Network and the Bitcoin network to understand their similarities, differences, and potential implications for the future of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\n\nFoundational Principles\n\nBitcoin, introduced in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, was designed to be a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network. Its foundational principles include security, transparency, and scarcity. Bitcoin's blockchain technology enables secure transactions without intermediaries or central authorities.\n\nPi Network, on the other hand, was founded by a team of Stanford graduates in 2019. It creates a digital currency, $PI, that can be mined using mobile devices, making it accessible to the masses.\n\nMining and Network Security\n\nBoth Pi Network and Bitcoin utilize mining as a fundamental process, but they employ different approaches. Bitcoin mining involves solving complex mathematical problems through computational power to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This process ensures network security and prevents double-spending.\n\nIn contrast, Pi Network's mobile mining aims to provide an alternative approach that allows users to mine using their smartphones. It utilizes a consensus algorithm that doesn't require massive computational power or energy consumption. However, it's important to note that Pi Network is still in the enclosed mainnet phase, and the security and decentralization of its network are not as established as Bitcoin's.\n\nScalability and Transaction Speed\n\nScalability has been a significant challenge for Bitcoin. The network can handle a limited number of transactions per second, leading to congestion during peak periods and higher transaction fees. Various solutions, such as the Lightning Network, have been proposed to address these scalability issues and enhance transaction speed.\n\nPi Network, a relatively new project, has not yet faced the same scalability challenges as Bitcoin. However, as Pi Network aims to achieve widespread adoption, it must address scalability concerns to support a growing number of transactions and users when the open mainnet goes live.\n\nMarket Acceptance and Value\n\nBitcoin has gained widespread acceptance and recognition as a digital asset and a medium of exchange. It has attracted institutional investors, retail traders, and merchants worldwide. Bitcoin's value is determined by market demand, and its price has experienced significant volatility over the years.\n\nIn comparison, Pi Network\u2019s enclosed mainnet phase means that its native currency has not yet been listed on major exchanges. Its value and market dynamics are not freely tradable or well-established. Pi Network's success in gaining market acceptance and establishing value will depend on user adoption, utility, and listing on reputable exchanges.\n\nCommunity and Ecosystem\n\nBitcoin has a robust and active community of developers, enthusiasts, and supporters. Its open-source nature has allowed for the development of various applications, platforms, and services built on top of the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin community has played a vital role in its growth and adoption.\n\nPi Network, as a newer project, is also building its community of users and supporters. It has attracted many early adopters enthusiastic about its vision of accessible mining. The Pi Network team actively engages with the community, providing updates and addressing concerns. Building a solid and engaged community will be crucial for Pi Network's success and future development.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe comparative analysis between Pi Network and the Bitcoin network highlights their differences in approach, mining methods, scarcity, scalability, market acceptance, and community dynamics. Bitcoin, as the pioneer in the cryptocurrency space, has established itself as a widely recognized and accepted digital asset. Its decentralized nature, security, and growing ecosystem contribute to its value and market dominance.\n\nPi Network, on the other hand, is a newer project that aims to bring mining to the masses through mobile devices. It introduces a unique consensus algorithm and focuses on accessibility and user-friendliness. However, Pi Network is still in its early stages, and its network security, scalability, and market acceptance are yet to be fully established.\n\nBoth Pi Network and the Bitcoin network contribute to the continuous innovation and evolution of decentralized finance. While Bitcoin remains the leader in market acceptance, value, and ecosystem development, Pi Network's vision of accessible mining and user-friendly approach could have implications for making cryptocurrencies more inclusive and widespread.\n\nWhat is Pi Network?\n\nPi Network is a mobile mining blockchain with an application that lets people earn Pi coins by doing simple tasks on their phones. However, the project remains in its development stage with delivery of an open mainnet still a matter of speculation, with no launch date confirmed.\n\nWith this in mind, the protocol remains in its testnet stage and will apparently go live when many users (Pioneers) complete the mandatory KYC procedure while the core team works on developing its ecosystem.\n\nPi Network is also reported to be under investigation by authorities in Vietnam and users should exercise a high degree of caution when interacting with the project and ensure they have conducted sufficient research before doing so."

        "title": "9 benefits of cryptocurrency in business - TechTarget",
        "content": "It's becoming increasingly clear that cryptocurrency usage is not a short-term fad and is likely to be a technology trend that will continue to provide benefits for business into the future.\n\nFor the uninitiated, cryptocurrency is a form of digital currencies that differs in many ways from the traditional fiat currency individuals worldwide have been using for centuries. Unlike fiat currency, cryptocurrency isn't issued and managed by any one central national government. Cryptocurrency is distributed and runs on blockchain technology that provides an immutable ledger for tracking transactions.\n\nThere are many different cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin perhaps the most well-known, though not the only, cryptocurrency in popular usage. Other commonly used cryptocurrencies used by businesses include Ethereum, which is widely used in support of Web 3.0 applications. Here are some of the many benefits of cryptocurrency for businesses.\n\n2. Access to new liquidity and capital Cryptocurrency has the potential to help a business raise new funds and improve financial liquidity. A business could potentially be loaned cryptocurrency without being subject to the same limitations that might be associated with getting a loan of fiat money from a traditional bank. Cryptocurrency is also often at the center of decentralized finance, which can potentially help a business with financial liquidity. In the early days of cryptocurrency, funds also were often raised via an initial coin offering (ICO). A new cryptocurrency is first minted and offered on an exchange much like an initial public offering when a company offers shares for sale for the first time. But the practical utility of ICOs as a vehicle for fundraising has diminished due to the crypto market's maturation. Companies stand to gain several advantages from cryptocurrency transactions.\n\n3. Expanded payment methods By supporting cryptocurrency, a business can offer consumers and business partners a broader range of payment options, instead of being limited to fiat currency alone.\n\n4. Potential for attracting new customers and demographic groups Every business accepts fiat money, but not every business accepts cryptocurrency. That differentiation can potentially attract new customers and different demographic groups beyond what a business can serve with fiat currency alone. An October 2022 report found that a growing number of businesses in the U.S. and worldwide are accepting cryptocurrency.\n\n5. Entry into the Web 3.0 world Cryptocurrency is a gateway for organizations to enter and be part of the Web 3.0 universe. Web 3.0 technologies rely on blockchain and tend to require cryptocurrency as a method of payment during transactions. There are many different Web 3.0 use cases and examples that can benefit a business. One method is participating in the decentralized applications (dApps) space to build or sell services, though it's not quite as comprehensive as it once was. There's also a market for businesses with nonfungible tokens.\n\n6. Transaction transparency and auditability Cryptocurrency is based on blockchain, which provides an immutable ledger -- a tamperproof, cryptographically assured record of transactions. The ledger's high degree of auditability enables a business to track audit transactions. The ledger also enables transparency to identify if a transaction occurs, potentially boosting accountability as well.\n\n7. Extra layer of customer privacy While the blockchain on which cryptocurrencies exist provides transparency into each transaction, it also helps protect user privacy. Blockchain and cryptocurrency, unlike fiat forms of payment like a credit card or bank account, don't associate with any personally identifiable information. A cryptocurrency transaction relies on public key cryptography that involves a public and private key, which individuals can use and store in a crypto wallet.\n\n8. Cross-border transactions Even in the modern era of technology, businesses often encounter barriers when selling their products globally because of issues related to handling fiat money payments. Cryptocurrency offers an alternative, enabling businesses to buy and sell products without engaging a bank or payment processor that might charge additional fees for an international trade. While the value of cryptocurrency can and does fluctuate, the prevailing value is consistent worldwide. This global consistency for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin eliminates the complexities of currency conversions and associated transaction fees, while the absence of intermediaries can potentially foster faster and more cost-effective transactions."

        "title": "Maybe Bitcoin didn't bottom? SEC lawsuit against Binance shakes BTC bulls' confidence - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price declined 5% in one hour on June 5 after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Binance on allegations of violating federal securities laws. Even though the $25,500 support held for Bitcoin, investors are still digesting the potential impacts of the regulatory action, which also involves Binance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao.\n\nAccording to digital asset investment firm Arca CEO Jeff Dorman, the direct impact of an eventual shutdown of Binance operations in the U.S. is irrelevant. Furthermore, non-criminal charges from the past should not destabilize Binance\u2019s present international structures. Still, Arca\u2019s CEO expects negative market sentiment to prevail as the crypto community cheers for CZ and Binance.\n\nMy 2 sats on SEC vs Binance\n\n\n\nMostly irrelevant since no one operates in the US anymore and a bunch of non-criminal charges for past wrongdoings don\u2019t really matter.\n\n\n\nI see 2 actual negatives from this: \u2b07\ufe0f \u2014 Jeff Dorman, CFA (@jdorman81) June 5, 2023\n\nBinance is not the only pressing concern\n\nEven if the SEC charges against Binance have little to no impact in the medium term, there\u2019s additional uncertainty coming from Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its subsidiary Genesis Capital, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Jan. 19.\n\nlooks like a dcg portco\n\n-manages ~3b of silbert's personal holdings\n\n-lent genesis 1b\n\n-pulled 1b coincident w/ 3ac default / dcg note\n\n-has ~ no clients other than barry\n\n\n\nits v clear nobody else reads these filings carefully\n\n\n\nthe stonewalling makes sense!https://t.co/7NgFnUkmp1 \u2014 Data Finnovation (@DataFinnovation) June 4, 2023\n\nAccording to Jon Reiter, CEO of Data Finnovation and ChainArgos, DCG CEO Barry Silbert pulled $1 billion out of his personal holdings just as cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital defaulted. While this could have been a coincidence, it certainly draws even more attention to the intercompany loans and deals inside DCG.\n\nTraders now question whether Bitcoin (BTC) will test the $25,000 resistance, a level unseen since March 17. Considering that the U.S. debt ceiling crisis has been averted, the odds for a surprise Bitcoin price rally seem even more unlikely in the short term.\n\nInvestors should be especially attentive if Bitcoin futures contract premiums flip negative or if increased costs for hedging using BTC options occur.\n\nBitcoin derivatives markets show a mixed reaction\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, BTC futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nBitcoin traders have been rather cautious since June 1, as the futures premium remained below 4%. On the other hand, the indicator stood at 3.5% after the SEC charges against Binance came to light on June 5.\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become more optimistic. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign of when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew.\n\nRelated: Fines and regulation, The ever-growing landscape of crypto compliance\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs displayed above, according to the BTC options 25% delta skew, traders suddenly flipped bearish, as the indicator spiked to 11% on June 5. This level was the highest in three months and signals discomfort from professional traders.\n\nThe bear trend continues while FUD prevails\n\nIn essence, Bitcoin options and futures markets suggest that the bear trend that started after the failed $31,000 test on April 14 continues, although there has been no significant fallout in the overall market structure. Yet, it might be too early to interpret the potential consequences of the SEC\u2019s actions, and court rulings take months \u2014 if not years \u2014 to settle.\n\nConsequently, those betting on a Bitcoin bull run should adjust their expectations because investors hate uncertainty.\n\nUntil there is more clarity on the DCG-Genesis situation and Binance\u2019s operational capability amid the tougher U.S. regulatory environment, there is less incentive for long-term buyers to step in and defend the all-important $25,000 support.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Who Has The Bitcoin? A Closer Look At The Bitcoin Supply - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The article below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.\n\nWho Holds The Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s public ledger comes with a unique level of transparency that includes significant information detailing where the bitcoin supply lives. With the help of address tracking, public announcements and some estimation across data sources, we can get a sense of where nearly 47% of total bitcoin supply is today. A considerable portion of bitcoin\u2019s 21-million supply is estimated to be lost, which includes Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s coins. There\u2019s useful data from both Glassnode and Chainalysis to suggest that nearly 4 million bitcoin has been lost.\n\nOther large amounts of bitcoin are on exchanges, in the Grayscale trust, or in bitcoin miners\u2019 wallets. Swaths of bitcoin have been accumulated by the likes of MicroStrategy, and more recently Tether. Some 5,500 bitcoin are locked up on the Lightning Network, while other sums exist as wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) on blockchains besides Bitcoin.\n\nMost bitcoin estimates can be tracked on a routine basis when looking at examples, like known U.S. government-associated on-chain addresses from various bitcoin seizures, or when analyzing monthly production updates from public bitcoin miners, while other holding details can be much harder to come by. A private institution may have indicated bitcoin holdings years ago, but isn\u2019t required to publicly announce updates of their stash. Other instances include uncertainty around government holdings. China may have 194,000 bitcoin from seizure, but it\u2019s difficult to verify if this number is current.\n\nAll that said, the below chart is a rough cut of available data that can be expanded upon and improved for better accuracy across different groups. These figures come from on-chain forensics, public SEC filings and balance sheet attestations.\n\nBitcoin holdings separated by type of entity.\n\nOf the 2.3 million of bitcoin on exchanges, the majority resides on Binance and Coinbase. This wouldn\u2019t include bitcoin in investment custody products like Grayscale and Coinbase Custody, for example. Binance\u2019s share of bitcoin on exchanges has risen from under 10% in 2019 up to 30% today. The company is estimated to have nearly 700,000 bitcoin on their platform, which can predominantly be attributed to their derivatives marketplace dominance and their international presence, whereas Coinbase is mainly a spot exchange with a heavy U.S. presence.\n\nThe percent share of exchanges' bitcoin balances.\n\nOver time, the amount of circulating bitcoin supply on exchanges has reached 17.5% of circulating supply, reaching its peak in March 2020 before declining to just 11.89%. We suspect that the trend of declining bitcoin on exchanges as a percentage of circulating supply will continue as bitcoin distributes across an increased number of global adopters, thanks to sophisticated personal custody solutions becoming more mainstream and robust as time goes on.\n\nA little less than 12% of circulating bitcoin is held on exchanges.\n\nIn absolute terms, there has never been this level of long-term holders in bitcoin. In relative terms, the only two times in history with a larger share of long-term holder coins is in 2009 before bitcoin had an exchange rate, and in the depths of the 2015 bear market. With so much of the supply off the market, sell-side pressure in the interim can result in large price adjustments to the downside, since many market participants are partaking in more of a passive role.\n\nLong-term holders' percentage of circulating supply is growing.\n\nWe can also look at bitcoin\u2019s illiquid supply to quantify holder dynamics. The term \u201cilliquid supply\u201d refers to bitcoin that are held by entities that rarely sell, meaning these coins are not readily available for trading. To quantify this, an entity's bitcoin holdings are deemed illiquid if less than 25% of its received bitcoins have been spent, liquid if 25% to 75% have been spent, and highly liquid if over 75% have been spent.\n\nIn the post-2016 halving era, bitcoin\u2019s illiquid supply as a percentage of circulating supply is at its highest level, with holder accumulation taking coins off the market faster than miner issuance can distribute them.\n\nAs of this April 2023, bitcoin\u2019s illiquid supply surpassed 15,000,000 coins.\n\nA large majority of bitcoin's supply is illiquid.\n\nIlliquid bitcoin supply has trended upward since 2016.\n\nThe trend is clear: Bitcoin continues to distribute into more hands, with a greater concentration of supply shifting from entities holding large amounts of bitcoin \u2014 balances of 1,000-10,000 BTC, 10,000-100,000 BTC, and greater than 100,000 BTC \u2014 to entities holding balances of 10 BTC or less.\n\nEntities' bitcoin balances of over 1,000 bitcoin has been trending down since 2011.\n\nBitcoin balances of less than 10 bitcoin has been growing for over a decade, meaning supply is getting distributed more evenly.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that entities holding large amounts of bitcoin, particularly those with 10,000-plus BTC, are likely managing keys for thousands or even millions of users, exchanges being an obvious example. This is often a classic source of mischaracterization and misinformation when people make claims regarding a lack of wealth distribution of bitcoin. Yes, there are clumps of addresses with large holdings of bitcoin, but this is like claiming that one corporation owns 14% of all U.S. dollars in the commercial banking system. While JPMorgan Chase has $2.4 trillion out of $17.1 trillion of deposits in domestic banks and the deposits are a liability of JPMorgan, in actuality, they are custodied for millions of unique individuals and businesses.\n\nThe key difference \u2014 aside from the legal versus cryptographic ownership structure \u2014 is the fact that bitcoin\u2019s ownership structure, the UTXO set, is much more transparent and easily auditable. This makes it easy for anyone to look at the data and make informed claims about bitcoin\u2019s supply concentration.\n\nFinal Note\n\nBitcoin has been successful in attracting a broad spectrum of holders, from individuals to corporations, private entities and even nation-states. As evidenced by increasing retail ownership and historically high levels of long-term holders, it\u2019s clear that bitcoin's supply is getting distributed more evenly across this vast array of adopters. This trend is further reinforced by a declining amount of bitcoin held on exchanges and an increasing illiquid supply.\n\nMoving forward, we anticipate these trends of increased distribution and declining concentration to continue, as bitcoin\u2019s 21,000,000 hard capped supply is divided up between the world\u2019s individuals, institutions, corporations and nation states.\n\nThat concludes the excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO.

        "content": "El Salvador continues its dedication to becoming a global leader in the Bitcoin mining industry through the development of its ambitious Volcano Energy project.\n\nThe country plans to add 241 MW of renewables and 1.3 Eh/s of Bitcoin mining, marking a further step towards \u201ceconomic freedom,\u201d energy competitiveness, and \u201cself-reliance,\u201d as shared on Twitter by Bitcoin advocate Dennis Porter.\n\nBitcoin Volcano\n\nHarnessing the country\u2019s renewable resources, the project aims to establish one of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin mining farms, accompanied by the creation of Volcano Tokens.\n\nThe Volcano Energy project focuses on developing a 241 MW renewable power generation park in the Metapan region of El Salvador. This park will showcase the \u201cexceptional solar and wind energy yields available in the country,\u201d with 169 MW of photovoltaic solar and 72 MW of wind energy.\n\nThe initial computational power of the Bitcoin mining farm will surpass 1.3 EH/s, funded by a total commitment of $1 billion for the project from \u201cBitcoin industry leaders.\u201d In addition, the Government of El Salvador will play a role in the project, securing a \u201cpreferred participation equivalent to 23% of the revenues.\u201d Furthermore, investors will own 27%, and the remaining 50% will be reinvested in \u201cexpanding energy production capacity and advancing Bitcoin mining.\u201d\n\nFor comparison, Hashrate Index lists the top mining pools by hashrate, indicating that El Salvador would be a top 20 mining pool by comparison. The largest pool is Foundry with 111.2 EH/s, followed by AntPool, F2Pool, Binance Pool, and ViaBTC pool with 85 EH/s, 50 EH/s, 33 EH/s, and 32 EH/s respectively. At 1.3 EH/s, Volcano Energy would have an equivalent hashrate to NiceHash and KuCoin.\n\nVolcano Tokens\n\nIn an April 2022 interview with CryptoSlate, Bitfinex & Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino discussed the revolutionary Bitcoin-backed Volcano Token (VT), representing the first tokenization of a sovereign bond.\n\nHe explained that the token serves as a capital raise for El Salvador\u2019s sovereign debt. Half the $1 billion raised will be used to buy and hold Bitcoin for five years, with profits split between infrastructure development and distribution to Volcano Token holders.\n\nArdoino also revealed that the underlying blockchain for the Volcano Token issuance would be Liquid, chosen for its allow listing feature, helping meet strong KYC and AML requirements from regulators.\n\nBitfinex Securities will trade the token once the necessary legislative approval is obtained and the company secures a license in El Salvador.\n\nAccording to Ardoino, he stated that this process could be completed in a matter of weeks. However, a recent Bloomberg report noted that the token is expected sometime in 2023.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Proposed 30% Tax on Bitcoin Mining Energy Use Dies in U.S. Debt Deal - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nA tax proposed by the Biden Administration to curtail Bitcoin mining in the United States has apparently been shelved indefinitely, thanks to the terms of a compromise over the U.S. debt ceiling.\n\nThe tax in question was known as the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax, and it was originally made public by the White House in early May as part of a broader budget proposal. Primarily targeting the environmental impact of the crypto industry, DAME as originally envisioned would have required all crypto miners in the United States to pay a tax equivalent to 30% of the cost of the electricity these companies use. Such a tax would not only be devastating to a business that relies on cheap power costs, but would also completely ignore the reality that a huge number of bitcoin miners today are reliant on renewable energy.\n\nHowever, this plan, and indeed all the White House\u2019s proposals for economic functioning, have been dramatically hampered by the latest round of negotiation over the U.S. debt ceiling. In essence, without a vote of confidence from an embittered Congress, the federal government would have defaulted on its loans, creating a crisis for the dollar. To continue the normal functioning of the global reserve currency, a deal was reached in late May that largely focused on concessions over economic policy. It\u2019s thanks to this deal that the DAME act seems well and truly shuttered.\n\nThe crypto community has generally reacted to this news with celebration, as some of the largest mining firms are seeing massive stock rallies on top of a year that has already been successful. For the moment, it does not seem like there is political will to carry out an attack on Bitcoin from this angle.\n\nJust because this plan has failed, though, does not mean that crypto miners are safe from similar taxes on other fronts. Considering that this proposal collapsed over the federal government\u2019s spending, Bitcoiners should be wary of the White House\u2019s arguments that the DAME tax would generate billions for federal coffers. In other words, it seems very likely that similar attacks on crypto mining will be proposed in the future, possibly in a reworked fashion to seem more economically valuable or otherwise accompanied by increased efforts to link crypto mining and climate change.\n\nFor now, DAME failed in the same month it was proposed, and the immediate threat to Bitcoin has passed. The speed of this victory should remind the world of how far cryptocurrency has come in the last few years; an economic maverick has seen enough acceptance within the halls of power that it now has no shortage of friends in the U.S. House and Senate. As the crypto industry continues to grow and represent economic freedom for millions of people worldwide, it seems safe to say that it\u2019s smart to bet on Bitcoin.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Hudson Structured Capital Management Ltd. (HSCM), the insurance, reinsurance and transportation focused investment manager, has participated in a seed funding round for cryptocurrency denominated Bermuda life insurance start-up Meanwhile.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile wants to help bitcoin holders make some of their assets active, by purchasing life insurance from the only insurer to be fully denominated in that specific cryptocurrency.\n\nThe company is launching with an offer of Bitcoin (BTC)-denominated whole life insurance, and Meanwhile hopes to attract long-term holders of bitcoin to see the opportunity to make some of the assets more active, rather than just holding them as a store of value.\n\n\u201cAs one of the few innovations in money in the last century, Bitcoin is on track to become a global store of value and functional currency,\u201d said Zac Townsend, Co-Founder and CEO of Meanwhile.\n\n\u201cWhen you combine that with artificial intelligence, we see the potential to build a full-stack life insurance company with the aim to reach over a billion people globally. To start, it makes perfect sense for long-term holders of BTC to invest in life insurance denominated in that asset and to enable a percentage of their BTC holdings to become active,\u201d Townsend said.\n\nMeanwhile also uses artificial intelligence in its underwriting of life insurance policies, with an AI-powered underwriting, claims, and operations system, as it hopes to deliver a more efficient end-to-end insurance experience, while also reducing manual labor and promoting transparency.\n\nThe start-up has raised $19 million across two seed rounds, with Hudson Structured Capital Management (HSCM) a participant, alongside other well-known venture and tech investing, as well as insurtech investing names, such as Sam Altman of OpenAI, former senior Stripe employee Lachy Groom, Gradient Ventures, Mouro Capital, and MS&AD Ventures.\n\nMeanwhile says it is licensed and regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, although we\u2019re unsure what class of company it is using at this stage. The company does state that its \u201clicensed and regulated Bermuda subsidiary is entirely denominated in BTC, accepting all premiums and paying out all claims in BTC.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile is sitting at the confluence of the AI and digital assets transformation,\u201d explained Anna Patterson, Managing Partner at Gradient Ventures. \u201cThe team has an opportunity to change how consumers use digital money and set a new standard for tech-enabled life insurance providers. We\u2019re excited to support Zac and Max on their mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe insurance sector is often regarded as inefficient and adverse to new technologies, and frankly, that is true in many cases,\u201d added Jon Soberg, Managing Partner of MS&AD Ventures. \u201cMeanwhile flips this perception on its head, uniting both blockchain and AI to create a truly one-of-a-kind, dynamic life insurance program. We are delighted to participate in this funding round and look forward to seeing the unique financial products Meanwhile will unveil.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile is also a tax advantaged way to make bitcoin active, the company states, with users able to access some of the liquidity of their life policies tax-free, while also acting as a way wealth can be passed on in a tax efficient manner."

        "content": "Send this page to someone via email\n\nU.S. regulators sued Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on Monday for allegedly operating a \u201cweb of deception,\u201d piling further pressure on the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchange and sending bitcoin to its lowest in almost three months.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint, filed in a federal court in Washington, D.C., listed 13 charges against Binance, Zhao and the operator of its purportedly independent U.S. exchange.\n\nThe SEC alleged that Binance artificially inflated its trading volumes and diverted customer funds, as well as failed to restrict U.S. customers from its platform and misled investors about its market surveillance controls.\n\nThe SEC also claimed that Binance and Zhao, its billionaire founder and one of the crypto industry\u2019s highest-profile moguls, secretly controlled customers\u2019 assets, allowing them to commingle and divert investor funds \u201cas they please.\u201d\n\nBinance created separate U.S. entities \u201cas part of an elaborate scheme to evade U.S. federal securities laws,\u201d the SEC also alleged, citing a number of practices first reported by Reuters in a series of investigations into the exchange published thisyear and in 2022.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFrom almost three years ago until June 2022, a trading firm owned and controlled by Zhao, Sigma Chain, engaged in so-called wash trading that artificially inflated the trading volume of crypto asset securities on the Binance.US platform, the SEC also alleged.\n\n2:02 Crypto exchange Coinbase dismisses 20% of workers in 3rd round of layoffs\n\n\u201cWe allege that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law,\u201d SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.\n\nIn a blog post, Binance said: \u201cWe intend to defend our platform vigorously,\u201d adding that \u201cbecause Binance is not a U.S. exchange, the SEC\u2019s actions are limited in reach.\u201d\n\nFinancial news and insights delivered to your email every Saturday.\n\nFinancial news and insights delivered to your email every Saturday.\n\n\u201cAll user assets on Binance and Binance affiliate platforms, including Binance.US, are safe and secure,\u201d the blog post said.\n\nBinance.US, which is ultimately controlled by Zhao, said in a tweet that the lawsuit was \u201cunjustified by the facts, by the\n\nlaw, or by the Commission\u2019s own precedent.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency, fell as much as six per cent on the news to its lowest in almost three months.\n\nBinance\u2019s own cryptocurrency BNB, the world\u2019s fourth-largest by market size, dropped more than five per cent.\n\nMarket players said the SEC\u2019s allegations could hobble Binance, with the lawsuit likely to reverberate through the crypto industry. Binance dominates crypto trading, last year processing trades worth about $65 billion a day with up to 70 per cent of the market.\n\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s a big risk here that this could be crippling to Binance,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.\n\n1:19 Bitcoins falls below US$20,000 for first time since 2020 amid financial turbulence\n\nLEGAL HEADACHES\n\nThe SEC complaint is the latest in a series of legal headaches for Binance, which was also sued by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in March for operating what the regulator alleged were an \u201cillegal\u201d exchange and a \u201csham\u201d compliance program. Zhao called those an \u201cincomplete recitation of facts.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBinance is also under investigation by the Justice Department for suspected money laundering and sanctions violations, according to people familiar with the probe.\n\nThe holding company of Binance, founded in Shanghai in 2017 by CEO Zhao, a Canadian citizen who was born and raised until the age of 12 in China, is based in the Cayman Islands. The exchange, however, says it does not have a headquarters and has declined to state the location of its main Binance.com exchange.\n\nThe SEC alleged that Zhao designed and implemented a plan to \u201csurreptitiously evade U.S. laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not want.com to be regulated ever,\u201d the SEC alleged that Binance\u2019s chief compliance officer admitted. Zhao directed Binance.US even though the U.S. entity has long said it operates independently, the SEC said.\n\nThe SEC said that billions of dollars in Binance customer funds were commingled \u2013 mixed with corporate funds, in breach of U.S. laws \u2013 in a bank account of an entity controlled by Zhao, and then transferred to a trading firm, Merit Peak, also controlled by Zhao.\n\n0:36 Cops warn of crypto scam after Winnipegger loses $168,000\n\nReuters reported last month that Binance commingled its customers\u2019 funds with its corporate revenues in a U.S. bank account belonging to Merit Peak. Binance denied mixing customer deposits and company funds, saying that users who sent money to the account were not making deposits but rather buying Binance\u2019s bespoke dollar-linked crypto token.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nReuters reported on Monday before the SEC lawsuit that a senior Binance executive was the main operator for five bank accounts belonging to BAM Trading, the operator of Binance.US, including an account that held American customers\u2019 funds.\n\nThe SEC wrote that the executive had at least until December 2020, also had \u201csignatory authority over BAM Trading\u2019s U.S. Dollar accounts.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York, Hannah Lang in Washington and Tom Wilson in London, additional reporting by Angus Berwick in London and John McCrank in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski)"

        "content": "Pouch.ph, a payment fintech based in the Philippines, said Monday it is transforming the landscape of the Philippine digital economy by enabling more than 400 small businesses to accept and process Bitcoin payments.\n\nPouch.ph said in a statement that it is tapping into the country\u2019s vast pool of tiny merchants\u2014from mom-and-pop stores to boutique hotels.\n\nIt said the firm utilizes Lightning Network built atop Bitcoin to make digital payments quicker, cheaper, and more user-friendly.\n\nThis payment protocol allows customers to pay by scanning a merchant\u2019s QR code with any Bitcoin wallet.\n\nPouch.ph then converts that Bitcoin to Pesos and sends the money directly to the merchant\u2019s bank or mobile money account, making the process easy and efficient for both parties.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges for the growth of small businesses is the availability of payment methods, with credit cards charging fees up to three percent, according to Pouch.ph Chief Executive Officer Ethan Rose.\n\n\u201cWith the growing number of internet and smartphone users in the Philippines, Bitcoin as a payment method will allow those who do not have credit cards or even local fiat currency to make online or in-store purchases,\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping businesses open up a vast market that was previously untapped,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the statement, more than 250 local businesses in the popular tourist destination of Boracay, including convenience stores, cafes, hotels, and restaurants, have already enrolled with Pouch.ph and have been integrating Bitcoin payments into their daily operations.\n\nBuilding on this success, the fintech firm is actively expanding its reach beyond \u201cBoracay Bitcoin Island\u201d and has onboarded merchants in Cebu City, Dumaguete, Iloilo, and Bacolod City.\n\nIn Metro Manila, some establishments have also started accepting Bitcoin as a valid form of payment through Pouch.ph such as the night bar URBN QC in Quezon City, Draper Startup House in Makati City, and niche retailer KosneyLand located inside a mall in Mandaluyong City.\n\nAside from receiving payments, some partner merchants use Pouch.ph for payroll.\n\nWith Batch Pay feature, business owners can instantly send money in batches to employees, suppliers, and other recipients, including transfers to all major banks and e-wallets.\n\nThey can transfer payroll directly to a Pouch Netbank Account with no fees, or to a nominated bank account for a minimal fee.\n\nThis innovative solution aims to simplify and streamline payment processes for businesses across the country.\n\nPouch.ph is also preparing to extend its Batch Pay services for over-the-counter remittances through LBC, M Lhuillier, and Palawan Pawnshop.\n\nFounded in 2021, Pouch.ph built the first lightning wallet for the Philippines so that Filipinos can have access to faster, cheaper, and more globally connected digital payments.\n\nThe firm allows users to send and receive payments across borders via the Bitcoin lightning network.\n\nPouch.ph is also partnered with global digital payments like Strike and CoinCorner to enable overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) to send money to Philippines instantly and with lower fees.\n\nPouch.ph said Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network is a world-changing technology that boosts financial inclusion and the efficiency of cross-border payments.\n\nThe firm is connecting the Philippine economy with the Lightning Network to ensure that Filipinos can seamlessly operate on this new payment standard."

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nBrazil has a vibrant crypto market with huge demand for digital solutions. There are several other exchanges and platforms operating in the country, some of which have also obtained payment provider licences from the central bank. These crypto exchanges include Crypto.com and Bitso.\n\nMercado Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency exchange in Brazil, has been granted a payment provider licence from the country\u2019s central bank on June 2, 2023. This licence will allow the company to launch its fintech solution MB Pay.\u201cThe approval of the Central Bank is a crucial step, as it allows us to continue expanding our business and providing a better service to our customers,\u201d said Roberto Dagnoni, CEO of 2TM, which is the parent company of Mercado Bitcoin.MB Pay will offer Brazilian users specific digital banking solutions using crypto assets held on the exchange. It will enable them to invest in digital fixed-income investments, stake their crypto and access other financial transactions. Further it is anticipated that a debit card which will offer users to convert their crypto currency to fiat currency will go live soon.One of the leading crypto exchanges in Brazil, Mercado Bitcoin has more than 3 million customers and over $5 billion in trading volume. Traditional local broker Guide Investimentos had also previously announced a partnership with Mercado Bitcoin for entering into the digital asset market.Its fintech rollout had actually been planned for 2021 but was delayed because of the regulator\u2019s approval process. The development came on the day on which Mercado Bitcoin had been ordered to return over 2,182 bitcoins.Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange of the US, is also expanding operations in the country by partnering with local payment providers to allow crypto purchases and withdrawals in Brazil\u2019s local currency.Recently Brazil has witnessed several other crypto-related moves, such as Latam Gateway, Binance\u2019s payment provider, receiving a similar licence. The company is a facilitator for foreign firms which seek to operate in Brazil.Overall, South American countries have been an attractive region for crypto. With many parts of the world struggling financially because of being underbanked or unbanked, nations like Brazil have attracted the attention of the crypto sector. This could make a huge change and include its citizens in the global financial market."

The name cursed Inscriptions refers to the unrecognized assets incorrectly created due to the misuse of opcodes to inscribe assets on satoshis.\n\nA fix could be underway\n\nAccording to the version 0.6.0 upgrade, the rollout would ensure the authentication of a Bitcoin username and password. In addition, the upgrade would allow zero-sat transactions to be unbonded from Inscriptions.\n\nIn April, Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor proposed to make the cursed assets tradable. But Rodarmor has since stepped down. And the released upgrade added that Raphjaph, one of the developers, has been promoted to lead maintainer.\n\nLeonidas.og, who is the builder of the ord.io project on Bitcoin Ordinals, as well as a BRC-20 token, also shared some insights on the development.\n\nVersion 0.6.0 of the Ordinals Protocol just went live! Here is everything you need to know about this major update: Many previously unrecognized inscriptions are now indexed by the Ordinals Protocol as \"Cursed Inscriptions\". This is important because over 70k existing but\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Mh1pArg2p9 \u2014 Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) June 4, 2023\n\nAccording to the creator, the transformation of the over 70,000 cursed Inscriptions into blessed ones would tow towards positive Inscription numbers. He pointed out:\n\n\u201cIf a new edge case is found and a new type of Cursed Inscription is added, the existing Cursed Inscriptions will be reindexed and the new Cursed Inscriptions will be inserted which will shift around the negative inscription numbers. Everyone holding Cursed Inscriptions should expect the negative inscription numbers to be shifted.\u201d\n\nOver the last few months, the emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals took the crypto community by storm. Recently, the number of Inscriptions crossed the 10 million market. This confirmed rising interest in the digital artifacts created on the Bitcoin network.\n\nLoosening momentum\n\nHowever, information from Dune Analytics showed that the growth of Inscriptions has been relatively stunted since the 10 million mark.\n\nAlthough the total number of Inscriptions rose to 10.91 million, the crypto-query data platforms showed that the Inscriptions only increased by 133,000 on 4 June. An explanation of this data points to restraint in increasing minting assets on the network.\n\nLaunched in January, the creation of Bitcoin Ordinals led to controversy in the crypto space. For some, it was unnecessary to add functions that didn\u2019t align with the blockchain\u2019s fundamentals.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nOthers, however, thought that it was not a bad idea to experiment on the network. Meanwhile, the outcome of the test, including BRC20, has ended in a positive, and vice versa.\n\nAt some point, the rapid increase in Ordinals transactions caused delays in transactions on the network. On the other hand, miners could register an increase in fees and revenues."

There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $26,100 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\n\nBitcoin is now facing resistance near the $25,900 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $27,489 swing high to the $25,400 low.\n\nThe next major resistance is near the $26,100 level and the trend line. The main resistance sits near the $26,500 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $27,489 swing high to the $25,400 low, above which the price might start a decent increase.\n\nSource: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next key resistance is near the $26,700 level. An upside break and close above $26,700 could start a decent increase toward $27,200. Any more gains above the $27,200 resistance zone might send the price toward the $27,500 resistance zone.\n\nMore Losses in BTC?\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s price fails to clear the $26,100 resistance, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $25,400 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $25,000 zone, below which the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $24,500 support in the coming sessions.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $25,400, followed by $25,000.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $26,000, $26,100, and $26,500.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Get all the essential market news and expert opinions in one place with our daily newsletter. Receive a comprehensive recap of the day's top stories directly to your inbox. Sign up here!\n\n(Kitco News) - Bitcoin can already address the twin problems of currency depreciation and spiraling debt, but to see it you need to step outside of the current financial paradigm, according to Jeff Booth, General Partner at Ego Death Capital.\n\n\u201cYou have a monetary system that is 10,000 times bigger than Bitcoin today, and that relies on theft,\u201d Booth said. \u201cThis is going to be hard to digest\u2026 because you're measuring a system problem from the system creating the problem, and all the politics on top, no matter what side, is just theater on top of a system problem.\u201d\n\nBooth spoke with Michelle Makori, Lead Anchor and Editor-in-Chief at Kitco News at Bitcoin Miami earlier this month. He said our debt-based financial system cannot function without continuous currency depreciation, which makes ordinary people poorer even as real productivity skyrockets.\n\n\u201cGlobally, there's about 400 trillion dollars of debt,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you try to pay back one trillion dollars at one dollar a second, it would take you approximately 32,000 years. So the debt is already insolvent, but we pretend it's solvent because we allow governments to manipulate money to pay back the debt with cheaper dollars tomorrow, and that manipulation of money carries a huge problem throughout society, because it's just manipulation.\u201d\n\nBitcoin mirrors rise of e-commerce\n\nBooth said today\u2019s Bitcoin vs. fiat analysis mirrors the online vs. physical store analysis from the 1990s and 2000s, seeing opportunities as threats and failing to account for the speed of technological change.\n\n\u201cIf you were an executive at Amazon from 1995 to 2010 versus an executive at Sears, you saw two different worlds,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw one getting easier and easier and easier, Amazon was providing more value to people and people were using it, it was getting stronger and stronger and stronger, and Sears was getting weaker and weaker and weaker, and your view of the world would be determined by what system you were looking through. Same world, it was just about the measure you were using to measure the world.\u201d\n\nHe said this is exactly what\u2019s happening in the financial system right now. \u201cThere is an open monetary network that any person on the planet can move over to, and essentially measure differently, and not have to pay for $400 trillion of debt that's already insolvent, and not having their wages decline in real terms every year,\u201d he said. \u201cMore and more people are moving over to it, and once they measure the world from that new system, they see truth, hope, abundance.\u201d\n\nAI will only magnify fiat manipulation\n\nBooth said the reason most people can\u2019t see the proven advantages of the Bitcoin system is because they are measuring Bitcoin\u2019s price from within the manipulated currency system, instead of using Bitcoin\u2019s price stability to measure the devaluation of the fiat system. \u201cThey're saying bitcoin price is going up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's the opposite.\u201d\n\nHe added that the economic and financial distortions caused by rising productivity being stolen by increased inflation will be magnified and accelerated with the advent of AI, automation and machine learning. \u201cIf you wait a year or two or three, artificial intelligence is going to merge with machines and it\u2019s going to bring productivity gains that we can\u2019t even imagine right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to mean that the prices will fall faster and faster and faster.\u201d\n\nCBDCs are about reasserting control\n\nBooth said that governments know they must maintain absolute control of the money in order to absorb all the real gains while staying ahead of the ballooning debt, and central bank digital currencies [CBDC] are their response to the decentralized, stable and honest pricing instrument that is Bitcoin.\n\nHe believes that despite resistance from people, banks and politicians, central banks could successfully implement CBDCs by giving the digital currency to the public. \u201cWill people fall for it? Yes,\u201d he said.\u201dBecause you\u2019ll give people programmable money and you\u2019ll say, \u2018here\u2019s a hundred dollars out of UBI,\u2019 and you\u2019ll lock them into that system. And a lot of people will think that they\u2019re safe when they\u2019ve just given away every individual right and freedom.\u201d\n\nBooth believes, however, that CBDCs will ultimately fail for the same reason fiat itself must fail: countries will manipulate their own CBDC, but will never trust one another\u2019s. \u201cIf you imagine every country with a CBDC, how could they trade together? How could there be global trade? Because then you\u2019d have to manipulate every currency transition, the market rates between currencies,\u201d he said \u201cAnd this is all in parallel while Bitcoin is getting stronger and stronger and stronger. So they will fail.\u201d\n\nHe said that once people understand that Bitcoin is actually pricing the baked-in risks of currency collapse and the debt spiral, rather than fiat pricing Bitcoin\u2019s supposed volatility, they\u2019ll recognize where the real value lies. \u201cThey see Bitcoin as a risk,\u201d Booth said. \u201cIt\u2019s the safest thing you could do right now.\u201d\n\nTo hear which countries will be the first to leave fiat for Bitcoin, and how deflation could actually be a positive, watch the above video."

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining: Understanding the Pros and Cons - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Understanding the pros and cons of Bitcoin mining for navigating the opportunities of the crypto space\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s first decentralized cryptocurrency, has gained significant popularity since its inception in 2009. As the demand for Bitcoin continues to rise, so does the process of Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining is the reason behind Bitcoins being circulated in the market.\n\nBitcoin mining, a subset of the cryptocurrency mining ecosystem focuses solely on the validation and security of Bitcoin transactions. The process of validating and recording transactions on the Bitcoin network, the main purpose of Bitcoin mining is validating transactions to prevent fraud and adding new blocks to the blockchain that results in the decentralized creation of new Bitcoins. As per a recent estimate, the Bitcoin price value is around US$27, 269.78 on the exchange market. Over the years, the Bitcoin currency value has grown with future promises to Bitcoin miners who usually validate transactions. Let\u2019s now delve into Bitcoin Mining: Pros and Cons\n\nPros of Bitcoin Mining\n\n1 Generates Profit:Bitcoin mining can be a lucrative endeavor for those who have access to the necessary hardware and low-cost electricity. Miners are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins and adding new transactions to the blockchain. In the early years, mining could be done using a regular computer, but as the network has grown, specialized hardware called Application-Specific Integrated Circuits has become necessary. Successful miners can earn a significant amount of Bitcoin if they mine efficiently and at the right time.\n\n2.Energy-intensive Nature: This nature of Bitcoin has drawn attention to the need for renewable energy sources. Miners seeking to maximize profits have shown interest in utilizing clean energy solutions like solar and wind power. This contributes to the growth of renewable energy infrastructure and helps mitigate environmental concerns associated with traditional energy sources.\n\n3.Security and Decentralization: Bitcoin mining plays a crucial role in maintaining the security and decentralization of the network. Miners validate transactions and ensure that they conform to the network\u2019s rules. This process prevents fraud and double-spending, making Bitcoin a secure digital currency. Additionally, the decentralized nature of mining means that no single entity has control over the network, reducing the risk of censorship or manipulation.\n\n4.Technological Innovation: Bitcoin mining has spurred technological innovation in the hardware industry. As the demand for more efficient mining equipment increases, companies invest in research and development to produce better ASICs. This technological progress can have spillover effects, benefiting other industries that require high-performance computing.\n\n5.An alternate income stream: Bitcoin mining offers an alternative income stream for individuals or businesses looking to diversify their financial portfolios. By engaging in mining activities, they can potentially generate revenue from the appreciation of Bitcoin as well as the mining rewards.\n\nCons of Bitcoin Mining\n\n1.Volatility and Market Risk: Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility poses risks to miners. The profitability of mining depends not only on the amount of Bitcoin mined but also on its market value. Fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s price can affect mining profitability, potentially rendering some mining operations unprofitable, especially during bear markets. Miners must carefully manage their operational costs and be prepared for market uncertainties.\n\n2.High Energy Consumption: Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process, primarily due to the computational power required to solve complex mathematical puzzles. As a result, mining operations consume significant amounts of electricity, contributing to environmental concerns and carbon emissions. Critics argue that the energy consumption associated with mining is unsustainable and exacerbates climate change.\n\n3.Cost of Equipment and Maintenance: Mining Bitcoin requires specialized hardware, such as ASICs, which can be expensive to purchase and maintain. Additionally, as the network difficulty increases, miners need to continually upgrade their equipment to stay competitive. The capital expenditure and ongoing maintenance costs can pose a barrier to entry for aspiring miners.\n\n4.Long-Term Viability: A greater supply of coins result in a decrease in mining rewards through a mechanism called halving. The decreased block rewards combined with the increasing difficulty level can make mining less profitable over time. Miners will need to rely more on transaction fees to sustain their operations with some challenges too regarding profitability.\n\n5.Centralization Concerns: While Bitcoin is designed to be decentralized, the reality is that mining has become increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few large players. Large-scale mining operations have access to more resources, allowing them to dominate the network and potentially control the consensus process. This concentration of power raises concerns about the centralization of Bitcoin mining and the security of the network.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "How Many Satoshis in 1 Bitcoin? - Bitcoin Australia",
        "content": "If you\u2019re new to Bitcoin, you may have heard the term \u201csatoshi\u201d thrown around on various websites and wondered what it means. Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive inventor of Bitcoin, introduced the concept of satoshis as the tiniest unit of the cryptocurrency. In this blog post, we\u2019ll explore the world of satoshis and how they relate to one Bitcoin. Whether you\u2019re a crypto newbie or just looking to expand your knowledge, let\u2019s dive into the world of satoshis together.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nWhat are Satoshis?\n\nCryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, is a rapidly growing market, and at the heart of it is the mysterious figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshis, named after their enigmatic creator, represent the minuscule units of Bitcoin. Think of them as the \u201ccents\u201d of the Bitcoin world, similar to dollars and cents in the traditional currency system. Commonly abbreviated as \u201csats,\u201d these smaller units help make Bitcoin transactions more manageable and flexible, especially when dealing with small amounts of money.\n\nHow Many Satoshis are in 1 Bitcoin?\n\nThere are exactly 100 million satoshis in one Bitcoin. This high level of divisibility allows Bitcoin to be easily split into tiny parts, making it more accessible for everyday use. To help you understand this concept better, we\u2019ve created a table below to show how you can convert between Bitcoin and satoshis:\n\nBitcoin Satoshis 1 100,000,000 0.1 10,000,000 0.01 1,000,000 0.001 100,000 0.0001 10,000\n\nWhy Use Satoshis?\n\nUsing satoshis instead of whole Bitcoins can provide several benefits when making transactions. For instance, the divisibility of satoshis allows for more precise payments, especially when dealing with small amounts in dollars. As the current price of Bitcoin continues to grow, using satoshis can make transactions more manageable and user-friendly on various websites and platforms.\n\nExample:\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to purchase a cup of coffee that costs 0.0003 Bitcoin, which is roughly equivalent to a ten dollars (inflation is rough!). To figure out how many satoshis you would need to pay, simply multiply 0.0003 by 100,000,000. This results in a total of 30,000 satoshis. In this case, one unit of Bitcoin (30,000 satoshis) is equal to the cost of your cup of coffee.\n\nWhere can I use Satoshi?\n\nWhile Bitcoin is becoming more and more popular, it\u2019s important to remember that not all merchants and service providers accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment. However, you can still use your satoshis to purchase goods and services through various cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms that do accept Bitcoin. To use your satoshis, you\u2019ll need to convert them into BTC and then transfer them into your wallet or account. Always do thorough research before making a purchase to ensure that the website or service you\u2019re using is reputable and trustworthy.\n\nHow Much is One Satoshi Worth?\n\nThe value of one satoshi is directly tied to the price of Bitcoin. As the price of Bitcoin fluctuates, so does the value of a satoshi. To determine the value of one satoshi in dollars, simply divide the current price of Bitcoin by 100,000,000. Keep in mind that the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can be volatile, so the worth of one satoshi may change from day to day or even within a single day.\n\nAdvantages of Satoshis:\n\nOne of the key advantages of satoshis is their divisibility, which allows Bitcoin to be broken down into tiny parts. This makes it easier to conduct transactions of various sizes and helps facilitate the widespread adoption of cryptocurrency. Additionally, using satoshis can make it more manageable to handle price fluctuations in the Bitcoin market, especially when converting to and from dollars.\n\nDisadvantages of Satoshis:\n\nDespite their advantages, satoshis can be subject to fluctuations in value. As the price of Bitcoin changes, the value of a satoshi can become more or less desirable. Additionally, the speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market means that investing in satoshis and Bitcoins may not be suitable for everyone.\n\nFAQ:\n\nAre Satoshis subject to transaction fees?\n\nYes, satoshis are subject to transaction fees, just like any other unit of Bitcoin. When you send satoshis from one wallet to another or use them to make a payment, there may be a small fee involved. These fees help support the network and incentivize miners to maintain the blockchain. It\u2019s essential to keep these fees in mind when making Bitcoin transactions on websites and platforms.\n\nCan I earn Satoshis through mining?\n\nYes, you can earn satoshis through mining. When you mine Bitcoin, you\u2019re essentially solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions on the blockchain. In return, you\u2019re rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin. As Bitcoin is divisible into satoshis, your mining rewards can be broken down into tiny units, too.\n\nAre Satoshis subject to capital gains tax or other taxes?\n\nThe tax treatment of satoshis varies depending on your country\u2019s laws and regulations. In many countries, satoshis are subject to capital gains tax, just like any other asset. It\u2019s important to consult with a tax professional or conduct thorough research to understand the tax implications of holding or transacting with satoshis in your jurisdiction.\n\nWe hope this blog post has given you a better understanding of satoshis and their role in the world of cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin. As you continue to explore Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, keep in mind the various advantages and potential drawbacks of using satoshis in your transactions on websites and platforms. Remember to stay informed and always conduct thorough research before making any financial decisions. Good luck on your crypto journey, and may the satoshis be with you!"

        "content": "Budget 2022 will be announced on 1st February 2022 addressed by FM Nirmala Sitharaman.\n\nIn this article we cover the following topics:\n\n\n\nLatest updates \u2013 Clarification on proposed Section 115BBH in Budget 2022\n\n\n\n1. Losses incurred from one virtual digital currency cannot be set-off against income from another digital currency.\n\n2. Infrastructure cost incurred on mining crypto assets will not be treated as cost of acquisition.\n\n\n\nUnion Budget 2022 Outcome:\n\n\n\n1.

No deduction, except the cost of acquisition, will be allowed while reporting income from transfer of digital assets.\n\n3. Loss from digital assets cannot be set-off against any other income.\n\n4. Gifting of digital assets will attract tax in the hands of receiver.Losses incurred from one virtual digital currency cannot be set-off against income from another digital currency.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is one of the earliest forms of cryptocurrency, forming part of the worldwide peer-to-peer payment system.\n\nCryptocurrency is digital money. It is considered to be more secure that the real money. Cryptocurrency uses something called cryptography to secure its transactions. Cryptography, to put it in simple words is a method of converting comprehensible data into complicated codes which are tough to crack. Cryptocurrencies are classified as a subset of digital currencies, alternative currencies and virtual currencies.\n\nBitcoin was the first ever cryptocurrency created in the year 2009. Subsequently, there has been a rapid increase in the number of cryptocurrencies that have been created some of which are Litecoin, Ethereum, Zcash, Dash, Ripple etc. Bitcoins, in India, have slowly started gaining popularity, given the efforts of the government to move towards a cashless economy.\n\nHowever, one should know that bitcoins, as of today, are not centrally administered or regulated by any specific body like the RBI which administers physical currency in India. In fact, peer-to-peer transactions with bitcoins are managed using something known as the blockchain technology which serves as a public ledger for all transactions.\n\n\n\nWhere does bitcoin come from or how is it generated?\n\nOne can obtain bitcoins either by :\n\nMining:\n\nMining is an activity where an individual (called the \u201cminer\u201d) uses his computer prowess to crack computationally difficult puzzles. The process of cracking such puzzles which are integral to the blockchain technology, help in maintaining them. As a reward for this, the miner gets new bitcoins which is nothing but creation of a bitcoin or mining.\n\n\n\nPurchasing them from a bitcoin exchange against real currency\n\n\n\nEveryone cannot be a bitcoin miner. Hence, you can consider buying bitcoins from bitcoin exchanges and store them in an online bitcoin wallet in digital form. Unicorn, Bitxoxo, Zebpay, Coinbase etc., are some of the bitcoin exchanges presently in India. Such bitcoins would be purchased in consideration for real currency.\n\nIt would be interesting to note that currently, the value of 1 bitcoin is approximately about INR 31,99,620.\n\n\n\nReceiving bitcoins in consideration of selling goods and services:\n\n\n\nThough this may not be a common phenomenon in India currently, there are few savvy businessmen who accept bitcoins (instead of real currency) on sale of goods or services, they deal in.\n\n\n\nIs bitcoin legal in India?\n\nAs earlier discussed, bitcoin, as a medium of payment, has neither been authorized nor been regulated by any central authority in India. Further, no set rules, regulations or guidelines have been laid down for resolving disputes that could arise while dealing with bitcoins. Hence, bitcoin transactions come with their own set of risks.\n\nHowever, given this background, one cannot conclude that bitcoins are illegal as, so far, there has been no ban on bitcoins in India. The Supreme Court of India has in its ruling pronounced on 25 February 2019 required the Government to come up with Cryptocurrency regulation policies. The matter had been adjourned in the hearing on 29 March 2019 and has been rescheduled for hearing in the second week of July 2019.\n\n\n\nHow are bitcoins taxed in India?\n\nThe concept of bitcoins being quite new to the Indian market, apparently the government has not yet brought taxability of bitcoins into the statute books. At the same time, the levy of tax on bitcoins cannot be ruled out because the Indian income tax laws have always sought to tax income received irrespective of the form in which it is received.\n\nTherefore, the possibility of tax on bitcoins can be looked at under the following circumstances:\n\n\n\nScenario A: Bitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoins created by mining are self-generated capital assets. Subsequent sale of such bitcoins would, in the ordinary course, give rise to capital gains.\n\nHowever, one may note that the cost of acquisition of a bitcoin cannot be determined as it is a self-generated asset. Furthermore, it does not fall under the provisions of Section 55 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 which specifically defines the cost of acquisition of certain self-generated assets.\n\nTherefore, the capital gains computation mechanism fails following the Supreme Court decision in the case of B.C.Srinivasa Shetty. Hence, no capital gains tax would arise on the mining of bitcoins.\n\nThis position would hold till such time the government thinks of coming up with an amendment to Section 55 of the Act.\n\nAt this juncture, given that the Indian tax laws are silent on the taxability of bitcoins completely, we thought it right to comment on a probable contrary view by the income tax authorities. There is a possibility that the department may not consider bitcoins as capital assets at all.\n\nHence, the provisions of capital gains would not apply at all. Accordingly, the income tax authorities may choose to tax the value of bitcoins received from mining under the head \u201cIncome from other sources\u201d\n\n\n\nScenario B: Bitcoins held as an investment being transferred in exchange for real currency\n\nIf bitcoins, which are capital assets, have been held as an investment and are transferred in exchange for real currency, the appreciation in value would give rise to a long term capital gain or a short term capital gain depending on the period of holding of the bitcoin.\n\nFurther, long term gains would be taxed at a flat rate of 20% while short term gains would be taxed at the individual slab rate. The cost of acquisition for arriving at long term capital gains will be determined after giving the benefit of indexation. A simple example is given below to understand this :\n\n\n\nParticulars Value in INR (Only hypothetical) No. of bitcoins purchased\n\n10 INR equivalent of 1 bitcoin at the time of purchase\n\n2.72 Value of bitcoins (A)\n\n27.2 INR equivalent of 1 bitcoin on the date of transfer\n\n8.72 Value of bitcoins (B)\n\n87.2 Capital gains (B - A)\n\n60.00\n\nReiterating the probable contrary view of the income tax authorities discussed under Point 1 above, the IT authorities may not consider Bitcoins as a capital asset and hence the provisions of capital gains would not apply.\n\nAccordingly, the income tax authorities may choose to tax the gains from bitcoins under the head \u201cIncome from other sources\u201d.\n\nFurther, if the income gets taxed under \u201cIncome from other sources\u201d, the taxpayer would have to pay taxes at a rate as applicable to the tax slab he falls under.\n\nFor eg, if his taxable income exceeds Rs 10 lakh, he would be liable to a tax @ 30% as against the flat rate of tax of 20% he would be liable to pay if charged to tax under long-term capital gains. The benefit of indexation as would be available if taxed under capital gains, would also not be available if taxed under Income from other sources.\n\n\n\nScenario C: Bitcoins held as stock-in-trade being transferred in exchange for real currency\n\nThe income arising out of bitcoins trading activity would give rise to income from business and accordingly, the profits arising out of such business would be subject to tax as per the individual slab rates.\n\n\n\nScenario D: Bitcoins being received as consideration on sale of goods and services\n\nBitcoins being received so shall be treated on par with receipt of money. It would constitute income in the hands of the recipient. Further, since the recipient received this income out of a business or profession, he would be taxed, normally, under the head profits or gains from business or profession.\n\nAs regards the disclosure requirement of bitcoins in the income tax return forms, there continues to be a lack of clarity. In the budget 2018, our Finance Minister, Mr Arun Jaitley, has stated in the budget speech, \u201c112. Distributed ledger system or the blockchain technology allows the organisation of any chain of records or transactions without the need for intermediaries. The Government does not consider crypto-currencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system. The Government will explore use of blockchain technology proactively for ushering in digital economy.\u201dFurther, the Central Bank also has chosen to reinforce its earlier message to \u201cusers, holders and traders of Virtual Currencies (\u201cVCs\u201d) including bitcoins regarding the potential economic, financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks associated in dealing with such VCs.\u201d\n\nTherefore, considering that bitcoin transactions are gradually picking up in India, while, laws regulating them are significantly absent, we are hopeful that the government will come up with a notification soon to dispel the ambiguity around the legality of bitcoins, their taxability and disclosure requirement of bitcoins.\n\nWhile this article aims at discussing the taxability of Bitcoins only, the tax treatment on transacting with other cryptocurrencies would also be similar to that in the case of Bitcoins.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nYou Might be Interested in"

        "title": "Top Canadian Bitcoin ETFs - The Motley Fool Canada",
        "content": "When it comes to buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Canadian investors usually resort to cryptocurrency exchanges. From there, investors can either hold Bitcoin online in their \u201chot wallet\u201d for easy access or transfer it offline to a \u201ccold wallet\u201d for greater security.1\n\nHowever, this approach cannot be implemented in a TFSA or RRSP as Bitcoin is not considered a \u201cqualified investment\u201d when it comes to the Income Tax Act.2 A potential way to get around this constraint and the need for self-custody of Bitcoin is via a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nBitcoin ETFs are a relatively new type of investment product that debuted in Canada in 2021. These crypto funds provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin while ensuring a high degree of transparency and liquidity via the ETF structure. Here\u2019s all you need to know before you buy your first Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF works the same as any other ETF, by holding an underlying portfolio of assets in its basket and creating shares which trade on stock exchanges under their own ticker symbol. Unlike Bitcoin, Bitcoin ETFs can be bought and sold via most brokerages.\n\nHow does buying a Bitcoin ETF work?\n\nWhen you buy shares of a Bitcoin ETF, the ETF provider will use your investment to purchase Bitcoin from a cryptocurrency market maker. From there, the ETF provider will store that Bitcoin in secure, offline cold storage to keep it safe.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF shares you purchase will represent holdings in a specific amount of Bitcoin. Thus, when the price of Bitcoin moves, the price of your Bitcoin ETF shares will as well. Over time, this will help the Bitcoin ETF track the returns of Bitcoin, minus any fees.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Bitcoin ETFs will charge ongoing fees, which include management fees, administrative, operational, and marketing expenses. Together, these comprise the ETF\u2019s management expense ratio, or MER. The MER is an annual percentage fee deducted from your investment. For example, investing $10,000 in a Bitcoin ETF with a 1.00% MER would result in around $100 in annual fees.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin ETFs can come in currency hedged or unhedged versions. Because the price of Bitcoin is tracked in U.S. dollars (USD) but Bitcoin ETFs trade in Canadian dollars (CAD), fluctuations in the USD/CAD exchange rate can add additional volatility.\n\nCurrency unhedged Bitcoin ETFs accept this. When the USD performs well, they gain extra value. When the CAD performs well, they lose extra value. Currency hedged ETFs attempt to mitigate this by using forward derivatives.\n\nTop Canadian Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe following Bitcoin ETFs are listed on Canadian exchanges and have some of the highest assets under management, or AUM.\n\nBitcoin ETF Inception date Highlights Purpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCC) 2021-02-25 First Bitcoin ETF in Canada. Holds actual Bitcoin in cold storage. 3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCQ) 2021-03-21 Tracks the U.S. dollar price of Bitcoin via actual Bitcoin in cold storage. CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCX.B) 2001-03-05 Tracks the U.S. dollar price of Bitcoin via actual Bitcoin in cold storage.\n\nPurpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCC)\n\nBTCC was the first Bitcoin ETF launched in the world and is one of the most popular. The ETF holds actual Bitcoin in offline cold storage with its cryptocurrency custodian Gemini Trust Company and is currency hedged. BTCC also comes in currency unhedged (BTCC.B), U.S. dollar (BTCC.U), and carbon offset (BTCC.J) versions.\n\n3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCQ)\n\nBTCQ tracks the daily price of Bitcoin in U.S. dollars via actual Bitcoin held in trust with custodian Tetra Trust Company, with Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC acting as a sub-custodian. The ETF is managed by 3iQ and CoinShares, which are large digital asset fund managers in Canada and Europe, respectively. The ETF also comes in a USD-denominated version (BTCQ.U).\n\nCI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCX.B)\n\nOne of the lowest-priced Bitcoin ETFs on the Canadian market today is BTCX.B. Otherwise, the ETF functions similar to the previous options by holding actual Bitcoin in offline cold storage with its custodian. This ETF is offered by CI, but staffed with a management team from Galaxy Digital Capital Management LP, one of Canada\u2019s larger digital asset managers. The ETF also comes in a USD-denominated version (BTCX.U).\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin ETFs in Canada\n\nThe process of how to buy Bitcoin ETFs mirrors the steps outlined in our guide on how to buy ETFs in Canada, but with a few additional considerations to keep in mind:\n\nExotic ETFs : Some Bitcoin ETFs use derivatives to gain enhanced exposure. These include covered call Bitcoin ETFs, which deliver high yields; and inverse Bitcoin ETFs, which provide the daily opposite return of Bitcoin. These ETFs can be quite complex and risky, so ensure you do your research before buying one.\n\n: Some Bitcoin ETFs use derivatives to gain enhanced exposure.

A large after-hours or weekend movement in Bitcoin can cause Bitcoin ETFs to experience high volatility at market open or close, so it\u2019s best to avoid trading at those times.\n\n: Unlike actual Bitcoin, Bitcoin ETFs do not trade 24/7.

Therefore, investors should avoid using market orders and instead place limit orders to avoid locking in a poor unanticipated sell or buy price. Redemption: Most Bitcoin ETFs cannot be redeemed for actual Bitcoin. They can only be sold on their own for a capital gain or loss.\n\nAre cryptocurrency ETFs a good investment?\n\nBitcoin ETFs are a risky and speculative investment. Historically, they have been capable of strong gains, but also deep losses. This is because the underlying Bitcoin is highly volatile. Investors who buy Bitcoin ETFs must deal with not only market risk, but also the risk that specific technological or regulatory developments will negatively impact Bitcoin.\n\nIn addition, the MERs charged by these ETFs tend to be many magnitudes higher than regular index ETFs. Over time, the high fees can compound and eat into long-term returns. In contrast, holding Bitcoin in a hot or cold wallet does not incur fees outside of trading commissions and bid-ask spreads. In addition, a Bitcoin ETF does not provide true ownership of the underlying Bitcoin4.\n\nHowever, if you aren\u2019t comfortable with self-custody of Bitcoin or want to hold it in a tax-advantaged account, then a Bitcoin ETF could be a viable alternative to actual Bitcoin. These ETFs are transparent and tightly regulated, publish their holdings frequently, and are subject to strict reporting requirements. If you have a high-risk tolerance and don\u2019t mind a speculative asset, then a Bitcoin ETF might be right for you."

It has seen steep appreciation ever since the start of 2021 on the back of positive developments. Yet, it is still not considered legal tender in many countries, including India. However, investors are seeking to invest in Bitcoin as an investment avenue. We have covered the following in this article:\n\nWhat Exactly are Bitcoins?\n\nBitcoins are the most popular crypto or virtual currency. Bitcoins are a currency similar to any other currency but just that they don\u2019t have any physical form. They are in use since the year 2009. Bitcoins are the pioneer of the decentralised digital currency in the world. No government or regulatory body oversees the circulation of the currency.\n\nHow to Invest in Bitcoins in India?\n\nYou can purchase Bitcoins in India through various online Bitcoin exchanges. You may also see some platforms that allow peer to peer Bitcoin transfer. However, it is advisable to purchase Bitcoins only through Bitcoin exchanges in order to avoid the chances of losing your money.\n\n\n\nBefore you could invest in Bitcoins, you are required to under KYC (know your customer) verification. You have to provide your PAN card, valid address proof and photographs in the prescribed format to complete the process. You may undergo your KYC verification before or after opening a trading account with a Bitcoin exchange.\n\nLegal Status of Bitcoins in India\n\nThere are several questions over the legal status of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies in India. In 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) restricted commercial banks from facilitating Bitcoin transactions in the country. This was a major jolt to the industry.\n\n\n\nHowever, this order of RBI was rebuked by the apex court in 2020. This gave the crypto exchanges much-needed relief as they could restart their business. One thing to note here is that it was never illegal to hold or transact in Bitcoins in India.\n\nHow Much Can You Invest in Bitcoin?\n\nAs of the 19th of March 2021, the price of one Bitcoin stands at a massive $58,497.30. However, you are allowed to buy partial Bitcoins. Therefore, you need not arrange for a sum touching nearly $60,000 to get started with investing in Bitcoins. You can invest even a sum as low as Rs 100.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the fact that investing or trading Bitcoins in India is not illegal, there are not many takers. Investors are still sceptical about the associated risks, and the warning issued by RBI and the government have only added to the woes of Bitcoin exchanges in India.\n\n"

        "content": "On June 5, 2021, El Salvador made waves across the financial space when its bill to make Bitcoin a legal tender in the country was first made public. Since then, the North American country has gone on to completely implement BTC as a legal tender in the country, as well as invest a significant amount in the digital asset as well. Here\u2019s how the country has fared since then.\n\nEl Salvador Down On Its Bitcoin Bet\n\nShortly after President Nayib Buckle passed the bill and made Bitcoin a legal tender in El Salvador, the country would begin buying BTC in large quantities. The first purchase saw the country buy a total of 400 BTC for $18.724 million for an average price of $46,811 on September 6, 2021, a day before BTC officially became legal tender in the country.\n\nIn the months that followed, Bukele would double down on his decision to invest in the cryptocurrency using the country\u2019s funds, disregarding warnings from financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stop doing so.\n\nThe next purchase happened just a day later on September 7 with a purchase of 150 for approximately $6.9 million. El Salvador has continued to purchase BTC since then on a semi-consistent basis since then, which has brought its total BTC stash to 2,381 as of its last purchase on June 30, 2022, of 80 BTC at an average price of $19,000 worth $1.52 million at the time.\n\nEl Salvador's total BTC purchases | Source: BuyBitcoinWorldwide\n\nHowever, El Salvador\u2019s dollar cost average (DCA) has not helped its position so far. The country has spent a total of $103,233,360 on its BTC purchases since 2021 at an average price of $43,357. At current prices, El Salvador\u2019s BTC stash is worth around $61.3 million, meaning the country is nursing a $40 million loss on its BTC investment.\n\nBTC Adoption In The Country\n\nSince September, BTC has operated as a legal tender in El Salvador, allowing residents to pay for goods and services using the cryptocurrency. However, the adoption has not been as swift as expected as the US dollar remains dominant in the country.\n\nFollowing the 2021 official announcement, there were reports of protests about the use of BTC as a legal tender, with many citing the security and economic risks of using a volatile digital asset as a legal tender. And even today, those concerns remain at the forefront of the minds of lawmakers.\n\nBTC retests $26,000 resistance | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn May, US senators James Risch, Bob Menendez, and Bill Cassidy introduced a bill to require El Salvador to report on the adoption of BTC in the country. This bill called the Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador Act proposes to assess \u201cthe risks for cybersecurity, economic stability, and democratic governance in El Salvador.\u201d\n\nPresident Bukele is yet to respond to this bill which has given a 90-day window for the plan to be submitted to the committees of Congress involved in the matter.\n\nOn June 5, Reuters reported that El Salvador entered into a public-private partnership to invest $1 billion into creating a large Bitcoin mining farm. Volcano Energy confirmed this, revealing that the country will first put $250 million into the project as it looks to build one of the largest BTC mining farms in the world."

        "content": "In recent times, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, has experienced a cooling of its value as the broader crypto market enters a consolidation phase. Despite a bearish outlook, on-chain data suggests a promising accumulation pattern around specific price levels. This analysis provides insights into the recent market trends and highlights the potential impact on future Bitcoin price movements.\n\n???? There is an interesting dichotomy across the #Bitcoin #Accumulation Trend persists, as the largest of Whales (>10K #BTC) continue to aggressively accumulate, whilst all other groups of traders experience heavy distribution.\n\n\n\n*@STETRADING* DIRECTLY IN YOUR ACCOUNT ???? pic.twitter.com/hZ0kIMVp1T \u2014 Ste Trading (@SteTrading897) June 4, 2023\n\nThe Consolidation Phase and Recent Price Correction\n\nAs of 3:00 AM (UTC) on Monday, Bitcoin prices are hovering around the $26,800 mark, reflecting a marginal loss of 0.50%. The entire crypto market has entered a consolidation phase, leading to a bearish outlook for the week with a 0.37% loss.\n\nBitcoin struggled to breach the resistance point above $30,000, trading at a low of $25,878.43 in the month that just ended. However, amidst these fluctuations, evidence from on-chain data reveals a distinct accumulation pattern.\n\nPromising Accumulation Levels\n\nA crypto analyst going by the name Ali of @Ali_Charts on Twitter highlights a notable accumulation occurring around the price levels of $26,360 and $27,160. Within this range, a significant number of addresses, approximately 2.36 million, purchased a total of 1 million BTC.\n\n#Bitcoin | The most important support level for #BTC is now between $26,360 and $27,160, where 2.36 million addresses bought over 1 million $BTC. pic.twitter.com/XoUJecFXRf \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) June 4, 2023\n\nThis recent accumulation suggests a potential price impact in the coming days as market participants begin to realize the significance of this trend according to a report.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Price Outlook and Fundamental Support\n\nWhile the short-term outlook remains bearish, several fundamental factors may support Bitcoin\u2019s price growth in the near future. Firstly, the market received relief when the proposed 30% tax on Bitcoin mining, included in the debt ceiling bill, was blocked. This decision offers leverage to investors who had been hesitant to invest due to unfavorable crypto regulations.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin\u2019s forthcoming halving event, scheduled for April next year, may also influence its price positively. Additionally, the Litecoin Halving, which is expected to occur sooner, could potentially trigger a bullish sentiment in the market, benefiting Bitcoin as well.\n\nWhile impressive price growth is anticipated in June, market experts like Arthur Hayes project that the real rally for this year is more likely to commence in October.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent cooling in price and the consolidation phase of the crypto market have raised concerns among investors. However, on-chain data indicating a promising accumulation pattern offers a glimmer of hope for the future. The significant number of addresses purchasing BTC within a specific price range suggests a potential price impact in the coming days.\n\nDespite the bearish outlook, there are fundamental factors that could support Bitcoin\u2019s price growth. The blockage of the proposed 30% tax on Bitcoin mining brings relief to investors, enabling them to consider injecting cash back into the coin and the industry. Furthermore, the upcoming halving events, both in Bitcoin and Litecoin, may stimulate positive market sentiment and potentially contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\nIt is essential to note that while impressive price growth is anticipated in June, market predictions are subject to external factors and unforeseen events. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and influenced by various elements, such as more regulatory changes, global economic conditions, and investor sentiment. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial for investors to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\nOverall, while recent trends and fundamental support offer a positive outlook for Bitcoin\u2019s future price movements, it is essential to approach such predictions with caution. Stay informed, monitor market developments, and consider consulting with financial professionals to make well-informed investment choices in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies."
