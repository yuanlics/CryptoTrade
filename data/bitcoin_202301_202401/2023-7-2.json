        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission has never approved a spot Bitcoin ETF, but that may change in the near future, according to brokerage firm Bernstein.\n\nThe firm said in a Monday report that the agency is likely to soon approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, according to CoinDesk. Several other countries, including Brazil, Dubai, and Canada, have already approved similar ETFs.\n\nLast month, a flurry of applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs were filed after BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, applied for one on June 15. But the applications, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity, faced a setback last week when the SEC called them inadequate, as the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe Journal report claimed that the SEC told Nasdaq and Cboe, which are planning to list several of the proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs, that the applications didn\u2019t sufficiently outline a surveillance-sharing agreement meant to cut down on fraud and manipulation. The applications also did not specify which spot crypto exchange would be used for the ETFs and thus be subject to the surveillance-sharing agreement.\n\nCboe refiled the applications for Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck, Invesco, and ARK Investment Management on Friday, and specified that it would enter surveillance-sharing agreements with Coinbase, according to the Journal.\n\nLast month, the SEC approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF. The new Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF, or BITX, uses debt or derivatives to try to eke out a profit from increases in the price of Bitcoin futures contracts. The SEC has also previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs from firms such as ProShares and VanEck.\n\nStill, unlike a spot Bitcoin ETF, Bitcoin futures ETFs do not invest directly in Bitcoin, and BITX, the most recently approved example, is not meant for the common investor. According to the SEC filing for BITX, investors could lose their money in a single day, adding that the fund is not meant for, \u201cinvestors who do not actively monitor and manage their portfolio.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale\u2019s bid to convert its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an ETF seems to be going well for the firm, with at least one judge reviewing its case casting doubt on the difference in manipulation resistance between futures and spot prices. This could be sign that a spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved soon, according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe court did not sound convinced that the futures price is not derived from the spot price, and thus to allow a futures-based ETF and not allow spot sounds like a difficult pill to swallow for the courts,\u201d the report claimed, according to CoinDesk."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell and Ether rose during Monday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, while most of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization strengthened. Investor sentiment remained strong after the wave of institutional interest in crypto from a raft of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the final weeks of June.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin breaches US$31,195 following Fidelity\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application\n\nBitcoin slips, Ether inches up, top 10 cryptos in the green\n\nBitcoin inched down 0.31% from 6:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong to US$30,632. Ether gained 0.4% in the same period to trade at US$1,963, floating above US$1,900 since Sunday.\n\nCrypto investors remained optimistic after numerous spot Bitcoin ETF applications in June. Among the latest institutional players to join the race, asset management giant Fidelity filed a spot Bitcoin ETF application last week.\n\nThe U.S. regulator that approves ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission, on Friday indicated it was unimpressed by the Bitcoin ETF applications by financial heavyweights such as Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that a race is currently underway among institutional firms to get a Bitcoin ETF approved. Whether such an ETF will be approved soon and which one will be the first is known only to Mr Gensler, but it is safe to say that news of an approved ETF will have a positive impact on the Bitcoin price in both the short and long term,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cAn ETF will significantly lower the barriers to exposure to Bitcoin by providing an easily accessible investment vehicle and thus boosting demand for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nPolkadot\u2019s Dot token was the day\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 10, rising 4.48% to US$5.50, followed by Ether that increased 2.43% in the past 24 hours. The XRP token was the only one in the red, inching down 0.02% to US$0.4824.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 1.18% to US$1.21 trillion and market volume increased 20.72% to US$31.55 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales fall, Ethereum NFT sales gain\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.16% to 2,761.68 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and dropped 5.11% during the week.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales fell 15.56% to US$2.57 million, as sales for Uncategorized Ordinals fell 34.38% to US$1.25 million.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 7.54% to US$24.96 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 1.76% to US$5.35 million, while Mutant Ape Yacht Club sales inched up 1.69% to US$2.4 million.\n\nAzuki sales decreased 19.19% to US$1.89 million, after the new Azuki Elementals collection was criticized for being too similar to the original.\n\n\u201cBrutal weekend for NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cIt might be easy to point to Azuki\u2019s Elementals mint as the catalyst still, but lowering average sales and floor prices in top collections prior to Elementals mint showed that we were on the cusp of another free fall.\u201d\n\nThe Azuki Elementals collection began minting last Tuesday and sold out in 15 minutes, but left collectors disappointed as the latest collection looked almost the same as the original.\n\nAmong the Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast CAR NFT Composite was the only one in the green, inching up 0.84% to 967.02 points.\n\nAsian equities, U.S. stock futures rise on signs of easing U.S.-China tension\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities strengthened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong ahead of U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s trip to Beijing Wednesday to deepen communication between the two biggest global economies.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 1.7% and the Shenzhen Component Index inched up 0.59%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index rose 2.06% and the Shanghai Composite strengthened 1.31%.\n\nInvestor sentiment was bolstered by comments from Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who told CNN on Tuesday that U.S. inflation could fall to the Fed\u2019s 2% target by 2025. But he also cautioned of a \u201chigher probability of a mild recession.\u201d\n\nMost U.S. stock futures strengthened during Monday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, after falling U.S. inflation bolstered hopes of a less hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 futures index inched up 0.061%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures strengthened 0.29% but the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.11%.\n\nInvestors now await the release of the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index and S&P Global Manufacturing Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index for June, scheduled for Monday.\n\nInvestors are expecting more interest rate hikes this year in the U.S. following reiterated warnings from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in speeches last week in Europe that inflation has yet to be brought under control.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts an 87.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting on July 26 and predicts only a 12.6% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged.\n\nSee related article: EU publishes draft bill for digital euro and cash payments\n\nUpdates with equities section"

        "content": "The Bitcoin-related ETF market has been flourishing lately, showcasing exceptional year-to-date performances. Notably, BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, and Wisdom Tree have all recently submitted filings for Bitcoin spot ETFs. This surge in activity demonstrates that cryptocurrency has reclaimed its relevance in the world of ETFs.\n\nHowever, despite the promising YTD returns and the involvement of leading firms in filing for Bitcoin spot ETFs, the potential upside and limitations of these funds remain largely unknown. Additionally, there is a significant lack of substantial assets in many of the top-performing cryptocurrency ETFs. This likely reflects the hesitance of investors and advisors to invest in this particular space.\n\nThis article will take an in-depth look at a pair of top-performing Bitcoin-related ETFs. These two ETFs have garnered substantial assets and delivered impressive YTD returns. Additionally, we examine the highest-performing Bitcoin-related ETF, but we caution investors about solely focusing on its impressive YTD returns. Through exploring these funds\u2019 key characteristics, we aim to provide insight into whether or not these ETFs are worthwhile investment opportunities.\n\nSee More: \u201cFidelity Again Files for Spot Bitcoin ETF\u201c\n\nTwo Top Performing Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe investment world has recently witnessed a surge in the popularity of Bitcoin-related ETFs, with many of them producing impressive YTD returns.\n\nThe Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ), has a remarkable YTD return of 137.46% and has attracted AUM of $85.0 million since its debut on May 11, 2021. Its performance illustrates the extraordinary growth potential the fund offers. The fund\u2019s top holdings include Coinbase Global, Inc. Class A, Riot Platforms, Inc., and Hut 8 Mining Corp. The stocks in its portfolio represent the ETF\u2019s strategic focus on investing in leading companies at the forefront of crypto industry innovation. The one-year net flow of $17.46 million further highlights the increasing investor interest and support for this innovative ETF.\n\nWhile BITQ offers exposure to equities of companies operating in the cryptocurrency space, the actively managed ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) offers more direct exposure to bitcoin, though not the cryptocurrency\u2019s spot price. The first bitcoin futures ETF launched on October 19, 2021, and currently has $1.07 billion in assets under management. It gathered its first $1 billion in just a few days after its rollout, which demonstrated the intense demand for Bitcoin-related investment vehicles.\n\nThe fact that BITO currently has more than $1 billion in AUM with Bitcoin\u2019s price at roughly half of what it was at the fund\u2019s launch indicates that interest remains strong. It has seen inflows of more than $160 million YTD. BITO\u2019s YTD return of 79.22% and one-year return of 61.01% are certainly impressive, though not the highest among Bitcoin-related ETFs.\n\nSee More: \u201cCryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Rally Continues\u201c\n\nHighest Performing Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe highest-performing Bitcoin ETF in terms of YTD return is the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI). With a remarkable return of 191.05%, it has caught the attention of investors. The ETF has seen one-year net flows of $7 million and one-month net flows of $1.86 million, indicating a growing interest in the fund. However, it is worth noting that despite its impressive returns, the ETF\u2019s AUM stands at just $13.7 million, which is relatively small when compared to some other Bitcoin-related ETFs available in the market.\n\nConclusion\n\nInvestors should exercise caution when considering Bitcoin-related ETFs, given the market\u2019s volatility and uncertain longevity. The rapid and unpredictable price fluctuations in the cryptocurrency landscape necessitate a careful assessment of risk appetite and financial objectives before investing. Additionally, with the industry still evolving and regulatory frameworks yet to stabilize, careful research and due diligence, as always, are crucial to making informed investment decisions. By understanding the underlying assets, investment strategy, and historical performance, investors can navigate the dynamic world of Bitcoin-related ETFs with prudence and confidence.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "Bitcoin climbed above US$31,000 in Tuesday morning trading in Asia after Blackrock refiled a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application in the U.S. after the regulator criticised an earlier filing, suggesting the world\u2019s biggest money manager is determined to take a lead in cryptocurrency markets. Ethereum also logged gains amid institutional interest, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Polygon led the winners and Litecoin the losers.\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin rose 1.83% over the last 24 hours to US$31,142 at 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving up 2.85% for the past seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached a high of US$31,371 early Tuesday morning, the highest since June 2022.\n\nBlackRock submitted an amended application for a spot Bitcoin ETF on Monday, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said BlackRock\u2019s original filing was inadequate. BlackRock indicated in the new filing that Coinbase, the custodian of the proposed ETF\u2019s Bitcoin holdings, will provide market surveillance to support the ETF, according to a Bloomberg report on Tuesday.\n\nSeveral other financial institutions have filed Bitcoin ETF applications despite a crackdown last month by the SEC, which filed lawsuits against Binance.US and Coinbase last month for allegedly violating securities laws in trading cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn emailed comments, Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of digital asset exchange BTSE, said the SEC criticism of the application caused some selling last week, but \u201cinvestors remain quietly optimistic about future approvals.\u201d\n\nEther gained 1.18% to US$1,954.24, and added 5.23% for the week.\n\nBitcoin and Ether have both seen increased interest from financial institutions in the past week, according to a Monday report from European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares.\n\nBitcoin-linked digital asset investment products saw net inflows of around US$123 million in the week ending June 30, while Ethereum-linked products had net inflows of around US$2.7 million. Digital asset investment products have seen two weeks of net inflows since June 19, after logging 9 weeks of consecutive outflows.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin tokens traded higher in the past 24 hours, with Polygon\u2019s Matic token spearheading the rally with a gain of 4.60% to US$0.7119. It\u2019s up 10.18% for the week despite the U.K.-based fintech neobank and crypto exchange Revolut plans to delist Polygon, Solana and Cardano tokens for its U.S. users in September, according to a report by the Block on Monday.\n\nLitecoin led the losers in a potential price correction, falling 5.83% to US$106.69. It still logged weekly gains of 22.47% driven higher by the token\u2019s upcoming third halving event on August 2, which will make the token scarcer.\n\nLitecoin investors also received a boost after the token was selected to trade on the newly established EDX Markets exchange, which opened on June 20 and is backed by Wall Street heavyweights, including Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap rose 1.28% to US$1.22 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume rose 26.34% to US$37.86 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT volumes gain\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the main Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.08% in the 24 hours to 09:40 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,750, down 5.06% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Ethereum and Polygon NFT markets logged moderate increases.\n\nNFT trading volume on Ethereum rose 18.72% in the past 24 hours to US$27.29 million, according to CryptoSlam data, while Polygon\u2019s volumes surged 121.63% to more than US$1.89 million. Trading volumes also rose on the Bitcoin, Solana and BNB Chain networks.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), the second largest NFT collection by market cap, saw trading volume jump 52.56% to US$4.98 million, with Ethereum-based NFT collections Azuki and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) ranking the second and the third.\n\n\u201cA bit of a rebound today on the ETH side, which is in the green for the first time in days. Top collections like Bean, Azuki, and MAYC have had increases in their floor prices 7-20% and even BAYC has slowed its decline,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nHowever, the floor prices of some major NFT collections are still holding considerable losses for the past week, with BAYC floor price falling over 20% in the past seven days and Azuki sliding more than 50% over the same period, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nAzuki Elementals are a collection of 20,000 NFTs launched on June 27 as a spin-off of the original Azuki collection. While the Elementals sold out within 15 minutes, collectors started to complain that the supposed new NFTs looked almost identical to the original Azuki collection.\n\nAzuki DAO, a community of dissatisfied Azuki holders, was formed last week and passed a vote on Monday to launch a lawsuit against Azuki creator Chiru Labs, claiming the 20,000 ETH (US$39 million) the company holds should be returned to the DAO to \u201cpromote the growth of the entire Azuki community.\u201d\n\n\u201cNFT platforms have experienced an increase in trading volume in recent days, while the prices of blue-chip NFTs have declined,\u201d said Gracy Chen, managing director at digital asset trading platform Bitget, in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market is undergoing a major adjustment, but a decline does not necessarily indicate the decline of the entire industry,\u201d said Chen. \u201cAs NFT derivatives, including lending, indexes, perpetual contracts, and other products, are gaining traction, price fluctuations become more pronounced in the short term.\u201d\n\nU.S. futures dip\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures inched down 0.01%, S&P 500 futures dipped 0.04%, and Nasdaq futures fell 0.12%. The three major U.S. indexes closed higher in the regular Monday session, shortened ahead of the July 4 public holiday when the market is closed.\n\nIn Asia, mainland China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index closed 1.31% higher on Monday, despite the country\u2019s softening manufacturing recovery. South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose 1.49%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the gainers in the region with a 1.7% increase, according to CNBC on Monday.\n\nThe U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) dropped to 46.0 in June, the lowest since May 2020, according to a Monday report by the Institute of Supply Management (ISM). A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing and below 50 a contraction.\n\n\u201cCompanies reduced production and began using layoffs to manage head counts, to a greater extent than in prior months, amid mixed sentiment about when significant growth will return,\u201d wrote ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee Chair Timothy Fiore in the report.\n\nThe June PMI is the eighth consecutive month of contraction and is lower than the projection of 47.0, raising concerns about a recession, according to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nNew York Federal Reserve President John Williams\u2019 speaks on Wednesday and may provide an update on the Fed\u2019s view of inflation. The Fed releases its June meeting minutes on Wednesday, where it decided to leave interest rates unchanged between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 89.9% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, up from 87.4% on Monday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at just 10.1%.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

Solana added to gains after a slump that followed it being labeled a security by the U.S. financial regulator. Litecoin led winners, still riding the optimism of being included in the tokens trading on the Wall Street-backed EDX Markets exchange that opened on June 20.\n\nMixed crypto\n\nBitcoin added 0.41% to US$30,730.25 over the last 24 hours to 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. After a jump that followed a raft of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the final weeks of June, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost direction, adding just 0.61% over the past seven days.\n\nThe U.S. regulator that approves ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), on Friday indicated it was unimpressed by the Bitcoin ETF applications by financial heavyweights such as Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nEther, the world\u2019s second biggest token by market capitalization, added 1.49% to US$1,954.67. It\u2019s gained 2.65% for the seven days.\n\nSolana was among the gainers in mixed early Asia trading for other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The token rose 5.48% to US$19.43 for a weekly gain of 14.47%.\n\nSolana is rallying after a raft of bearish indicators last week, with Solana-based non-fungible token (NFT) protocol Cardinal saying it was shutting down, citing \u201cmacroeconomic challenges.\u201d The Revolut neobank and crypto exchange also reportedly told U.S.-based users last Wednesday that it will delist Solana, along with Cardano and Polygon.\n\nThe three tokens were among cryptocurrencies that the SEC named as illegally issued financial securities in its lawsuit filed last month against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum wrote on Twitter on Friday that the tokens don\u2019t deserve to be targeted. \u201cIf ethereum ends up \u201cwinning\u201d through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that\u2019s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn\u2019t even a victory.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nLitecoin led the gainers with a 6.37% increase in the last 24 hours to US$112.96. The token surged 27.98% in the past seven days.\n\nLitecoin, which was created in 2011 as a hard fork to Bitcoin, was one of the four tokens selected to trade on the EDX Markets exchange, which is backed by Citadel Securities and Fidelity Investments. The other tokens are Bitcoin, Ether and Bitcoin Cash. The New Jersey-based EDX opened for business despite the crackdown on crypto from U.S. regulators.\n\nThe California-based crypto exchange Kraken was ordered by a U.S. judge on Friday to submit information about its users to the Internal Revenue Service in an investigation of underreported tax liabilities. The crypto exchange was fined US$30 million in February by the SEC for its staking services, which the federal agency said were an offering of unregistered securities.\n\nOther crypto movers included Tron, which dipped 1.85% to US$0.07572, but gained 3.31% for the week. Binance\u2019s BNB token edged down 0.31% to US$247.13, and Cardano\u2019s ADA fell 0.13% to US$0.2905.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap edged up 0.02% to US$1.2 trillion, with trading volume dropping 7.54% to US$27.26 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFTs \u201cbrutal weekend\u201d\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

Another Ethereum-based collection, The Captainz, came in at second place with US$2.3 million.\n\nOver the weekend, the Memeland team behind The Captainz NFTs, revealed their PFPs or Profile Picture art upgrades for the collection but met with mixed to negative response. \u201cMost negative responses to the art came from people who were unaware that the art would be upgradeable with purchasable traits,\u201d Petscher explained. \u201cWithout these traits the base characters are nearly identical, which caused some confusion in the NFT community.\u201d\n\nU.S. equity futures little changed\n\nU.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen | Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were little changed as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged down 0.029%, S&P 500 futures dipped 0.011%, while Nasdaq Futures added 0.068%.\n\nU.S. equities rallied during regular trading on Friday, the last day of the first half of 2023, though face disruptions to trading this week with limited trading hours on Monday and the July 4 public holiday on Tuesday when equity markets will be closed.\n\nEconomic indicators to come this week include US manufacturing activity on Monday as well as a monthly jobs report on Friday. Tesla Inc.\u2019s Sunday announcement of record-breaking vehicle sales in the second quarter is a bullish factor for investors.\n\nJapan equities on Monday gained on the coattails of the Friday rally on Wall Street, with technology stocks leading the gains in Tokyo.\n\nIn China manufacturing slowed, but by less than expected. Both purchasing managers\u2019 Indices in Taiwan and South Korea also showed manufacturing contraction.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is traveling to China in an effort to try and improve communications and the frosty ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nInvestors are expecting more interest rate hikes this year in the U.S. following reiterated warnings from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in speeches last week in Europe that inflation has yet to be brought under control.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts an 87.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting on July 26 and predicts only a 12.6% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a narrow range for the past few days, but that doesn\u2019t take away the sheen from its stunning 84% rally in 2023. The strong recovery in Bitcoin\u2019s price has boosted buying in several altcoins, which have risen sharply from their yearly lows.\n\nAs the second half of the year begins, the central question on every investor\u2019s mind is: Will the rally continue? CoinGlass data shows that July has seen only three negative monthly closes since 2013, with the most significant decline being 9.69% in 2014. This suggests that bulls have a slight edge.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nA large part of the latest leg of the rally in Bitcoin and altcoins was fuelled by hopes that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission will approve one or more applications for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Any adverse news on this front could turn the sentiment bearish and result in a sharp sell-off.\n\nHowever, for now, Bitcoin and select altcoins are showing strength. Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may continue their up-move over the next few days.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin (BTC) continues to trade near the stiff overhead resistance at $31,000. This suggests that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits, as they anticipate another leg higher.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nUsually, a tight consolidation near a crucial overhead resistance resolves to the upside. The rising 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($29,278) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory indicate that the road of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nIf bulls propel and sustain the price above $31,000, the BTC/USDT pair is likely to start the next leg of the uptrend. The bullish momentum may catapult the price above the immediate resistance at $32,400. If that happens, the pair may continue its northward march toward $40,000.\n\nIf bears want to make a comeback, they will have to sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then slide to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($27,622).\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. The price has been stuck between $31,431 and $29,500 for some time.\n\nBuyers will have to drive and sustain the price above the $31,431 hurdle to indicate the resumption of the up-move. Alternatively, a break and close below the $29,500 support may start a deeper correction toward $27,500.\n\nLitecoin price analysis\n\nLitecoin (LTC) skyrocketed above the descending channel and the overhead resistance of $106 on June 30, indicating the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nLTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears yanked the price back below the breakout level of $106 on July 1 but the bulls purchased the dip. If buyers sustain the price above $106, it increases the likelihood of the continuation of the rally. The LTC/USDT pair could then soar to the overhead resistance zone between $134 and $144.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price slips and sustains below $106, it will signal that bears are selling at higher levels. That could pull the price to the psychological level of $100 and then to the breakout level from the channel.\n\nLTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that bears are attempting to guard the $112 level with vigor, but they are struggling to sustain the price below $106. This suggests that the bulls are buying at lower levels. The rising 20-EMA and the RSI in the overbought territory indicate that buyers have the edge.\n\nIf the price sustains above $112, the pair may start the next leg of the uptrend toward $126. The first support on the downside is at the 20-EMA and then at $98.\n\nMonero price analysis\n\nMonero (XMR) rose and closed above the downtrend line on June 23, invalidating the developing descending triangle pattern.\n\nXMR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe failure of a bearish pattern is typically a positive sign, as it traps several aggressive bears, resulting in a short squeeze. That could be seen in the XMR/USDT pair, which surged from $150 on June 23 to $171 on June 27.\n\nFollowing the sharp rally, the price has been oscillating between $171 and $160 for the past few days. The consolidation is a positive sign, as it shows that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.\n\nIf buyers shove the price above $171, the pair may start the next leg of the up-move. The pair may then skyrocket to $187. The bears will have to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA ($149) to seize control.\n\nXMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle, which generally acts as a continuation pattern. If buyers push and sustain the price above the triangle, it will suggest that the uncertainty between the bulls and the bears has resolved in favor of the buyers. That could signal the resumption of the up-move. The pattern target of this setup is $182.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the triangle. The pair could then plunge to $148.\n\nRelated: Why is Litecoin price up today?\n\nAave price analysis\n\nAave (AAVE) has been trading inside a descending channel pattern for the past several weeks. The price turned down from the resistance line of the channel on June 25, but the bulls arrested the correction at the 20-day EMA ($61.69).\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThis suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. The price has again reached the resistance line. The repeated retest of a resistance level within a short interval tends to weaken it.\n\nThe rising 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers propel and sustain the price above the channel, the AAVE/USDT pair could start a new up-move toward $84.\n\nThe 20-day EMA remains the important support to watch on the downside. A break and close below this level will suggest that the pair may spend some more time inside the channel.\n\nAAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up on the four-hour chart and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that buyers are in control. If bulls flip the downtrend line into support, the pair may rise to $76.\n\nAlternatively, if the price sinks and sustains below the downtrend line, it will signal that bears remain active at higher levels. The pair may then slump to the moving averages. A break below the 50-SMA may open the doors for a possible drop to $62 and then to $58.\n\nMaker price analysis\n\nMaker\u2019s MKR (MKR) is attempting to start an up-move. The bulls purchased the dip to the moving averages between June 24 and 28, indicating demand at lower levels.\n\nMKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($725) has turned up and the RSI is in the overbought territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. Buyers pushed the price above the downtrend line on July 2 but the long wick on the candlestick shows strong selling at higher levels.\n\nA minor positive in favor of the buyers is that they have held their ground. This enhances the prospects of a rally above the downtrend line. If that happens, the MKR/USDT pair may soar toward $979. The first sign of weakness will be a drop below $772. That could start a deeper correction toward the 20-day EMA.\n\nMKR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair closed above the downtrend line, but the rally is facing selling at higher levels. The bears are trying to trap the aggressive bulls by pulling the price back below the downtrend line. If they do that, the pair could descend to the 20-EMA. This remains the key level to watch out for because a break below it will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $900, it will suggest that bulls have flipped the downtrend line into support. That could start a rally to $941.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The filing included details of a June 8 agreement between the Nasdaq and Coinbase \u201cintended to supplement the exchange\u2019s market surveillance program\u201d and provide access to data on spot BTC trades.\n\nJUST IN: BlackRock has re-filed for spot bitcoin ETF, the resubmission was dated 6/29, Nasdaq just posted tho.

Discover SCENE\n\nBlackRock has submitted an amended application for an exchange traded fund that would focus on Bitcoin spot markets after the regulators expressed misgivings about its first attempt.\n\nIn a new filing submitted on its behalf by the Nasdaq exchange, BlackRock said that it will be finalizing a surveillance agreement with Coinbase (COIN), addressing one of the main objections the Securities and Exchange Commission has raised when rejecting applications for Bitcoin spot ETFs in the past.\n\n\"The Spot BTC SSA is expected to be a bilateral surveillance-sharing agreement between Nasdaq and Coinbase that is intended to supplement the Exchange\u2019s market surveillance program,\" read the filing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe proposed ETF will rely on Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States, as its custodian and for its spot market data for pricing. Coinbase also has an agreement to provide similar services to Fidelity, which is seeking its own Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nBitcoin prices surged after news broke that BlackRock\u2014the world\u2019s largest asset manager with $9.5 trillion under management in the first quarter of 2023\u2014was filing for the ETF. Since the filing was first reported on June 15, Bitcoin\u2019s price has risen by about 20%, especially as more firms piled in on submitting their own ETF filings.\n\nThis bullishness was strong enough that the markets shrugged off a June 30 report in the Wall Street Journal that the SEC found BlackRock\u2019s application to be inadequate.\n\nThe warning shot did not take long to resonate across the industry, with exchange operator Cboe quickly modifying its application for a spot ETF on behalf of Fidelity the same day as the WSJ report.\n\nRegistering a Bitcoin ETF with the SEC has been a difficult task, especially for funds dealing with spot market trading. To date, not a single application for such a spot ETF has been approved by the SEC due to concerns about potential fraud or manipulation in the spot market. By contrast, the SEC has approved four Bitcoin ETFs for futures trading.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn ETF is a type of investment product tied to commodities, currencies, stocks, or bonds. It allows investors to have skin in the game without actually owning a particular asset. A Bitcoin ETF allows investors to invest in the world's oldest and largest cryptocurrency without having to hold it themselves\u2014rather, they just buy shares that track the asset\u2019s price."

        "content": "2023 has been a very volatile year for the cryptocurrency market, with shaky market conditions and regulatory and safety concerns. Let's look at Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market in general and see where it is heading for the rest of the year.\n\nDue to pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory agencies, the value of Bitcoin (BTC) and other leading cryptocurrencies decreased significantly in May this year compared to their previous highs.\n\nBitcoin\n\n2023 has been a year of upwards momentum for Bitcoin but it hasn't been a smooth ride. In January we saw Bitcoin $20,000 again, peaking at around $25,000 in February before dropping back to $20,000 in March. In an intriguing turn of events, Bitcoin's price has surpassed $30,000 for the first time since June last year, reaching that price point in April. Notably, Bitcoin has also experienced an astounding 80% growth since the beginning of 2023.\n\nDuring March and April, there was a frenzy of investment in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to growing concerns about a contagion impact. Investors saw Bitcoin as a haven against the more volatile altcoins. Despite the turbulence in the financial sector and the prevailing challenges in the global economy, it is anticipated to make a significant impact throughout the year. As we enter July, Bitcoin continues to hold its value above the $30,000 mark, further contributing to the intrigue surrounding its future trajectory. Judging by the charts, it looks like Bitcoin is slowly moving up toward a new all-time high, possibly in 2024.\n\nThe rest of the crypto market\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Binance in March, alleging that the exchange had violated several securities laws by illegally recruiting customers in the United States. The CFTC alleged that Binance had violated these rules by unlawfully soliciting customers in the United States. It has been said that cryptocurrency businesses such as Coinbase, Ripple, and others are mulling the possibility of relocating their operations outside of the United States to avoid drawing the attention of regulatory agencies.\n\nIn May, Bloomberg published an article stating that two prominent cryptocurrency market makers, Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto, intended to expand their business activities. Jump Crypto will reduce the scope of its activities in the United States, while Jane Street will reduce the number of countries in which its operations will be active. According to the article, both of these firms will be reducing their operations in the U.S. due to crackdowns by regulatory bodies. Events like these could lead to other significant platforms following suit and scaling back their operations.\n\nIn closing\n\nConsidering the widespread uncertainty and the gradual recovery of global economic conditions, it is wise to approach market fluctuations carefully. Rather than hastily diving into any investment at this time, it is recommended to monitor the dynamics of the crypto market closely.\n\nBy doing so, cryptocurrency investors may have the opportunity to acquire their desired digital assets at a more reasonable price once the current market turbulence subsides. Plus, if you believe in four-year cycles, this is currently the right time to start buying your favorite cryptocurrencies for the long term.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Capping off a wave of Bitcoin ETF applications from other firms that followed\u2014including Invesco, Wisdom Tree, and Valkyrie\u2014Fidelity threw its hat back into the ring last week.\n\nHowever, the SEC believes BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s recent Bitcoin ETF applications \u201caren\u2019t sufficiently clear and comprehensive,\u201d according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWinklevoss asserts that the complete lack of options for spot Bitcoin ETFs has \u201cpushed\u201d U.S. investors toward Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust. Shares in Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin trust, launched in 2013, currently trade at a discount relative to its Bitcoin holdings due to shareholders\u2019 inability to redeem their shares.\n\nWhile Winklevoss called the product \u201ctoxic,\u201d he didn\u2019t mention that converting Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust into an ETF would likely resolve this discount, and the firm is currently suing the SEC over repeated denials to do just that.\n\nWinklevoss has joined a chorus of critics who say SEC Chair Gary Gensler is pushing innovation offshore, and said the agency meanwhile thrust \u201cinvestors into the arms of FTX\u201d and made them victim \u201cto one of the largest financial frauds in modern history.\u201d\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO and founder of FTX, has pleaded not guilty to a litany of charges he faces for conduct at the collapsed exchange, including fraud.\n\nSending investors abroad in search of Bitcoin exposure has also led them to do business with \u201cunlicensed and unregulated venues,\u201d Winklevoss claimed.\n\nGemini and the SEC are not on friendly terms. The regulatory agency accused Gemini of violating securities laws in January, alleging that its \u201cGemini Earn\u201d product constitutes an unregistered securities offering. Retail investors could previously loan their crypto to the now-bankrupt firm Genesis\u2014which was also charged by the SEC\u2014in exchange for interest on deposits.\n\nSEC Calls BlackRock, Fidelity Bitcoin ETF Applications Inadequate: WSJ\n\nNotably, Genesis and Grayscale are both owned by Digital Currency Group. And Genesis and Gemini have been engaged in a spat over a $900 million loan that Gemini extended to the crypto lender.\n\nWinklevoss considered a lawsuit against DCG and company CEO Barry Silbert earlier this year, but Gemini, Genesis, and DCG reached an agreement \u201cin principle\u201d in February. However, Gemini said DCG missed a $630 million loan repayment this past month and risks defaulting on its obligations.\n\nWinklevoss expressed hope that the SEC will \u201creflect on its dismal record\u201d and focus on its stated duties, \u201cinstead of overstepping its statutory power and trying to act like the gatekeeper of economic life.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Winklevoss ended his post with accolades for \u201call those fighting the good fight to bring U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs to life\u201d\u2014which, in practice, may preclude certain companies that have outstanding applications or lawsuits."

Shares in Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin trust, launched in 2013, currently trade at a discount relative to its Bitcoin holdings due to shareholders\u2019 inability to redeem their shares.\n\nWhile Winklevoss called the product \u201ctoxic,\u201d he didn\u2019t mention that converting Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust into an ETF would likely resolve this discount, and the firm is currently suing the SEC over repeated denials to do just that.\n\nWinklevoss has joined a chorus of critics who say SEC Chair Gary Gensler is pushing innovation offshore, and said the agency meanwhile thrust \u201cinvestors into the arms of FTX\u201d and made them victim \u201cto one of the largest financial frauds in modern history.\u201d\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO and founder of FTX, has pleaded not guilty to a litany of charges he faces for conduct at the collapsed exchange, including fraud.\n\nSending investors abroad in search of Bitcoin exposure has also led them to do business with \u201cunlicensed and unregulated venues,\u201d Winklevoss claimed.\n\nGemini and the SEC are not on friendly terms. The regulatory agency accused Gemini of violating securities laws in January, alleging that its \u201cGemini Earn\u201d product constitutes an unregistered securities offering. Retail investors could previously loan their crypto to the now-bankrupt firm Genesis\u2014which was also charged by the SEC\u2014in exchange for interest on deposits.\n\nNotably, Genesis and Grayscale are both owned by Digital Currency Group. And Genesis and Gemini have been engaged in a spat over a $900 million loan that Gemini extended to the crypto lender.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWinklevoss considered a lawsuit against DCG and company CEO Barry Silbert earlier this year, but Gemini, Genesis, and DCG reached an agreement \u201cin principle\u201d in February. However, Gemini said DCG missed a $630 million loan repayment this past month and risks defaulting on its obligations.\n\nWinklevoss expressed hope that the SEC will \u201creflect on its dismal record\u201d and focus on its stated duties, \u201cinstead of overstepping its statutory power and trying to act like the gatekeeper of economic life.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Winklevoss ended his post with accolades for \u201call those fighting the good fight to bring U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs to life\u201d\u2014which, in practice, may preclude certain companies that have outstanding applications or lawsuits."

It represents a gain of 2.4% over the past day and Bitcoin\u2019s highest price since June of last year.\n\nOver the past year, Bitcoin has risen 62%, navigating multiple crises like the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the historic blowup of several regional banks, eventually ending up in the green.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast June was one of Bitcoin's worst months since 2011, sliding as low as $19,000 from around $30,000.

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin's rally continued on Monday as the coin jumped back above $31,000 for the second time over the past week. The largest digital asset by market cap was trading for $31,052 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThat's a 1.8% 24-hour jump. The asset is also up over 2% in the past seven days, with a 17% gain over the past 14 days.\n\nBitcoin first broke past $31,000\u2014for the first time in over one year\u2014two weeks ago thanks in part to renewed institutional investor interest. A high-profile Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) application from BlackRock and the launch of a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets were among the triggers, according to experts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin dropped below that mark in recent days and was holding firmly above $30,000 per coin aside from a brief dip on Friday. But the price is now comfortably above $31,000 again.\n\nInvestment firm CoinShares said on Monday that institutional investors are continuing to plug money into digital asset products, with $125 million worth of inflows over the past week. And most of that money is focused on Bitcoin, it added.\n\nThis week in Fund Flows, by CoinShares Head of Research @jbutterfill:\n\nBullishness on crypto among investors continues, with US$125m inflows in digital asset investment products. \ud83e\uddf5 (1/5) pic.twitter.com/rX6KZrSOgm \u2014 CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) July 3, 2023\n\nInstitutional investors are interested in the digital asset market because major Wall Street firms like BlackRock\u2014the world's largest asset manager\u2014and Fidelity have applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF, which allows investors to buy shares that track the price of an asset, does not yet exist in the U.S. However, the flurry of applications potentially show that traditional investors are hungry for such a product.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe largest digital asset by market cap isn't the only cryptocurrency up today: Ethereum, the second largest, is fast closing in on $2,000 per coin, CoinGecko data shows. It is right now trading for $1,961, a 2.3% climb over the last 24 hours.\n\nIf it hits $2,000, it will be the first time since May that the coin topped that mark. Ethereum remains down nearly 60% from its peak price of $4,878 from November 2021, according to CoinGecko, while Bitcoin is down 55% from its own all-time high from the same month.\n\nAnd Pepe, a newer meme coin which launched in April, is one of the best-performing digital assets today: it is up 16.7% in the past day and 15.1% in the past week, trading hands for $0.00000182.\n\nThe asset has surged in value since its launch\u2014with one lucky investor managing to turn $250 into $1.02 million worth of the cryptocurrency in just four days amid its initial spike.

        "title": "Institutional Investors Flock To Bitcoin: Are We Witnessing A Paradigm Shift? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Bitcoin market is experiencing a seismic shift, with recent data revealing fascinating trends that shed light on the evolving dynamics. From a significant decline in Bitcoin inflows to a historic drop in supply on exchanges, coupled with a surge in institutional fund accumulation, these developments highlight a maturing market and changing investor sentiment.\n\nUnprecedented Decline In Bitcoin Inflows and Supply\n\nThe on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant has today published extremely interesting data on the behavior and cohorts of Bitcoin hodlers via Twitter.\n\nOver the past 612 days, Bitcoin has witnessed an 80% decline in the number of addresses recording inflows, which can be interpreted as selling activity. This decline reaches an even higher figure of 84% when measured from the peak in May 2021. These numbers even surpass the previous record set during the 2017 parabolic top, demonstrating the magnitude of the current trend.\n\nBoth narrowly beat the second highest decline in addresses associated with inflows between the 2017 parabolic top into 2018 bear, at 78.5%.\n\nIt is important to note that these figures do not account for addresses that have moved to self-custody or differentiate between miner activity and retail investors. This suggests that the decline in addresses associated with inflows may be even more significant than the data implies, potentially indicating a shift towards long-term holding strategies or alternative custodial methods.\n\nIn a parallel trend, the overall supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has been steadily shrinking since March 2020, marking a period of consistent decline that had not been witnessed before in Bitcoin\u2019s history. This decline is not only significant in its duration but also in its depth, as Bitcoin reserves on exchanges have dropped by over 30%. CryptoQuant\u2019s experts further note:\n\nMarch 2020 was the highest ever supply recorded on exchanges, and preceded by consistent ten years of supply growth. The 1200 days since, are the first period of consistent decline in Bitcoin\u2019s history. [\u2026] Retail traders and institutions are holding more Bitcoin than ever.\n\nThis also indicates a major potential shift from active trading and speculative behavior towards long-term holding strategies.\n\nInstitutional Fund Accumulation Signals Confidence\n\nAs the decline in inflows and supply unfolds, another intriguing trend emerges: institutional fund accumulation, as observed by CryptoQuant. Institutional investors, including hedge funds, investment firms, and cryptocurrency private funds, are currently actively increasing their holdings of Bitcoin.\n\nThis exponential increase in fund holdings demonstrates a strong interest in acquiring Bitcoin, even at its current price level. Institutional investors often take a more patient and long-term approach compared to short-term traders who closely monitor price fluctuations.\n\nBy closely monitoring fund holdings, investors can gain valuable insights into market sentiment and the confidence that institutional investors have in Bitcoin as a long-term asset. And the following chart by CryptoQuant is showing just that, an ultra bullish stance by institutions.\n\nThe positive evolution of Bitcoin\u2019s perception is probably further reinforced by recent developments in the regulatory landscape and the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Regulatory frameworks, especially those being implemented by countries in the European Union with MiCA, are beneficial for the institutional Bitcoin adoption.\n\nMoreover, the filings and re-filings of Bitcoin spot ETFs by major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, indicate a growing recognition of Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a legitimate investment. These ETFs provide a more accessible and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially driving further institutional adoption and market growth.\n\nAt press time, the BTC price stood at $30,716, remaining in its range between $29,800 and $31,000.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Parameshwara on Monday. The team could also take the help of technical experts since the matter relates to cybercrime, he added.\n\nThe Bitcoin scam had surfaced during the BJP\u2019s regime and the Congress, which was then in Opposition, had accused the government of trying to cover up the scandal as it involved big names. The prime suspect, Srikrishna alias Sriki, was accused of hacking the State government\u2019s e-procurement website and siphoning off over \u20b911.5 crore.\n\nHe was arrested by Central Crime Branch, Bengaluru, in relation to a drug case where drugs were bought off darknet using crypto currency. Sriki allegedly confessed to hacking several international crypto currency exchanges, including Bitfinex. His confessions of hacking and stealing of crypto currencies totalled to several thousands of crore as on the day of his confession. Some of the stolen Bitcoins from Bitfinex that were blacklisted were allegedly moved to unknown destinations when Sriki was in custody, raising eyebrows.\n\nThe Home Minister on Monday said on Monday, \u201cWe had promised to the people of Karnataka that if we come to power we will reinvestigate Bitcoin scam. Accordingly we have taken a decision to hand it over to SIT we have constituted under the CID. We hope the committee will do justice.\u201d\n\nBengaluru Police Commissioner B. Dayananda had earlier written a letter to the DG&IGP demanding a further probe into the case, as the case since it has national and international ramification. Since the Congress government assumed power in Karnataka in May, Mr. Parameshwara has repeatedly said that the Bitcoin scam would be re-examined.\n\nFormer Karnataka Chief Minister and BJP leader Basavaraj Bommai said that they welcome the move of SIT probe into the Bitcoin scam."

        "content": "After it finally crossed the $30,000 psychological threshold, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently looking at a strong resistance zone around $31,000, and if it manages to break it, a significant bull run could follow, and historical chart patterns suggest it might even reach $80,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nAs it happens, a cryptocurrency market analyst known as Crypto Tony has pointed out that if Bitcoin fails to take out the resistance area at $31,000 this week, it could \u201cdraw down to $28,000 for a reload option from the bears,\u201d according to his tweet on July 3.\n\nBitcoin price action analysis.
