        "title": "Bitcoin could support renewable energy development | Cornell Chronicle - Cornell Chronicle",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining is often perceived as environmentally damaging because it uses huge amounts of electricity to power its intensive computing needs, but what if the mining process could be used to mitigate climate change instead of accelerating it?\n\nA new study led by Cornell researchers investigated planned renewable energy projects across the U.S. and calculated each project\u2019s potential to profit from bitcoin mining during the precommercial development phase, when a wind or solar farm is generating electricity, but has not yet been integrated into the grid. The findings suggest some developers could be recouping millions of dollars, which could be invested in future renewable energy projects.\n\nThe study, \u201cFrom Mining to Mitigation: How Bitcoin Can Support Renewable Energy Development and Climate Action,\u201d was published Oct. 27 in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering and is authored by doctoral student Apoorv Lal and Fengqi You, the Roxanne E. and Michael J. Zak Professor in Energy Systems Engineering. Jesse Zhu, distinguished professor from the Western University of Canada, also contributed to the research.\n\nThe analysis showed that Texas is the state with the highest potential, with 32 planned renewable projects that could generate combined profits of $47 million using bitcoin mining during precommercial operations. The researchers determined that the Aktina Solar and Roseland Solar Projects in Texas \u2013 each with 250 megawatt capacities \u2013 were found to be the most profitable, generating a maximum profit of $3.23 million. The Western Trail Wind project, with a capacity of 367 megawatts, showed profitability of $2.65 million.\n\nProjects in California produced the second highest amount of profits in the study, while Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and Virginia had fewer installations but still show profitability.\n\n\u201cProfitability of a mining system hinges on periods of steady energy availability since renewable energy sources can vary significantly,\u201d said You, a senior faculty fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability. \u201cTherefore, it is important to site the mining farm strategically to maximize productivity.\u201d\n\nAs an example, You pointed to California, Colorado, Nevada and Virginia as states where solar installations were the only type of renewable energy project that proved profitable in generating bitcoin during the precommercial phase.\n\nThe researchers suggest several policy recommendations that could help improve the economic feasibility of renewable energy projects and reduce carbon emissions. One is to provide economic rewards for environmentally responsible cryptocurrency mining, such as carbon credits for avoided emissions.\n\n\u201cThese rewards can act as an incentive for miners to adopt clean energy sources, which can lead to combined positive effects on climate change mitigation, improved renewable power capacity and additional profits during precommercial operation of wind or solar farms,\u201d Lal said. \u201cWe also recommend policies that encourage cryptocurrency-mining operations to return some of their profits back into infrastructure development. This would help create a self-sustaining cycle for renewable energy expansion.\u201d\n\nWhile other aspects of cryptocurrency mining still have environmental costs, such as metal depletion and hardware that becomes obsolete within a few years, the researchers said the results indicate that there are ways to mitigate some of the environmental costs of cryptocurrency mining and foster investments in renewable energy.\n\nThe research was partially funded by the National Science Foundation.\n\nDiane Tessaglia-Hymes is a communications specialist for Cornell Engineering."

        "title": "Polluting Bitcoin Mines Come to Rural Georgia - greenpeace.org",
        "content": "Polluting Bitcoin Mines Come to Rural Georgia\n\nBy Erik Kojola and Veronica Kuzuhara\n\nIntroduction\n\nCleanSpark is one of the many Bitcoin mining companies expanding operations in Georgia and across the American South, attracted by lax regulations, tax subsidies, and low energy costs. Beyond the large carbon emissions, growth of the industry means residents of often-rural towns and small cities are confronting the disruptive and polluting impacts of Bitcoin mines in their backyards. Sandersville, Georgia is one of those rural communities where CleanSpark is developing what will be the company\u2019s largest facility.\n\nGrowth of Bitcoin mining in places like Sandersville is supported by investments from big Wall Street firms. Financial giants BlackRock and Vanguard are CleanSpark\u2019s largest shareholders and have provided the company with capital used to maintain and expand its facilities across Georgia. Yet, financial companies haven\u2019t acknowledged how their investments in Bitcoin mining companies are fueling the carbon-intensive and polluting facilities that are popping up in rural areas across the country.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Bitcoin Boom\n\nGeorgia is becoming a popular location for Bitcoin mines. Data from The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance found that Georgia was the most productive Bitcoin mining state in 2021, housing around 31% of all U.S. Bitcoin production. That\u2019s a significant amount since the U.S. hosts more Bitcoin mining than any other country. Miners are coming to Georgia in part for the low cost of electricity where the average energy price of 10.3 cents/kWh is lower than the U.S. average of 12.09 cents. CleanSpark is one of the companies driving the growth of Bitcoin mining in Georgia and operates facilities all across the state including in Norcross, Washington, College Park, two newly-acquired facilities in Dalton, and the company\u2019s largest in Sandersville.\n\nSandersville is a small city in central Georgia with a population of under 6,000 residents that used to be called the \u201cKaolin Capital of the World\u201d due to its extensive production of kaolin, a clay used in making porcelain. The town recently shifted to a new \u201cmining\u201d industry: Bitcoin. Mawson Infrastructure built the town\u2019s first Bitcoin mine in 2021. The site grew from an acre of shipping containers filled with specialized Bitcoin mining computers called ASICS to 41 containers\u201412 of which use as much electricity as the entire town of Sandersville. In October 2022, CleanSpark bought the site and equipment from Mawson, marking the company\u2019s fourth location in Georgia. CleanSpark now operates the facility with thousands of ASICS that use as much electricity as the nearest 49,000 households racing to solve algorithms in order to win newly minted Bitcoin and fees in return for validating Bitcoin transactions. The site is operating at a reported capacity of 80 MW with plans to expand to 230 MW by the end of 2023, dwarfing the 25 MW a day used by the city of Sandersville. In a September press release, CleanSpark said construction is underway for the 150 MW expansion and expected to be completed by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the Municipal Energy Authority of Georgia (MEAG) is building a 200MW substation and related infrastructure which will be used to power the additional capacity at the Sandersville site and expects the substation to be completed in 2023 and the power-line connections in early 2024.\n\nBitcoin Backed by Wall Street Giants\n\nBuying facilities, equipment, and land all requires capital which CleanSpark has gotten in part from the financial services industry. CleanSpark is a publicly-traded company which means the company can raise capital through issuing stock to the public and large investors. CleanSpark became publicly listed in 2020 and in the last few years has used additional equity offerings \u2013 putting up more company stock for sale \u2013 to raise capital for funding expansion. CleanSpark bought the Sandersville facility in September 2022 for $33 million, an acquisition that came after raising $211.86 million through two equity offerings in 2021 and another $40 million deal in 2020. Issuing new shares requires help from an investment bank who provides underwriting \u2013 verifying the company\u2019s finances, setting the sales price, and facilitating the deal. All of CleanSpark\u2019s recent offerings were led by HC Wainwright, an investment bank based in New York, who has provided underwriting for many Bitcoin mining companies.\n\nBig financial companies and institutional investors bought up many of CleanSpark\u2019s shares. Currently, CleanSpark\u2019s top two shareholders are BlackRock, with 4.45% of shares, and Vanguard, with 4.05% of shares \u2013 their combined holdings were valued at $67.91 million. [1] Both companies also increased their shareholdings as of the latest financial filings in August, 2023, BlackRock by 33% and Vanguard by 45%. [2] Other shareholders include big banks and asset managers like JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Fidelity.\n\nCleanSpark\u2019s Bitcoin Greenwashing of Climate Pollution\n\nCleanSpark claims to take a more sustainable approach to Bitcoin mining and to support renewable energy generation despite evidence that the company\u2019s facilities rely largely on fossil fuels. A press release issued at the time of purchasing the Sandersville site states, \u201cCleanSpark draws power predominantly from low-carbon sources, such as nuclear energy, and boasts a clean energy profile that is over 90% non-carbon.\u201d CleanSpark published its Energy Mix and Consumption Data in its 2022 ESG report and claims that from October 2021 to September 2022, the company\u2019s energy mix across four locations was 94.02% \u201cclean energy,\u201d 5.70% \u201ccarbon-based,\u201d and 0.28% \u201cundisclosed.\u201d [3]\n\nYet, other data and independent analysis contradict CleanSpark\u2019s \u201csustainability\u201d claims. Apart from the lack of specificity in what constitutes \u201cclean energy\u201d and vague sourcing of these figures as simply \u201cdata from the power providers,\u201d there is a huge discrepancy between these numbers and Georgia Power\u2019s energy mix, the electric utility that serves Sandersville and much of the state. Georgia Power, which generates most of the power it sells, had an energy mix in 2021 that was 47% gas and oil, 16% coal, 24% nuclear, and 8% renewables. Thus, the majority of its sources are fossil fuels. While the supply of renewables and fossil fuels vary in different parts of the state, that doesn\u2019t account for the wide discrepancy with CleanSpark\u2019s statements.\n\nA joint investigation by the New York Times and tech non-profit WattTime further challenges CleanSpark\u2019s claims about using clean energy. The investigation found that the Sandersville site used a daily average of 72 MW of electricity of which 91% came from fossil fuels, leading to 314,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year. The analysis also estimated that CleanSpark\u2019s College Park, Georgia mine got 91% of the facilities\u2019 power from fossil fuels\u2014emitting 166,000 tons of CO2. These numbers are a far cry from CleanSpark\u2019s \u201c90% non-carbon\u201d promise.\n\nCleanSpark may claim to operate on \u201cclean energy\u201d based on purchasing renewable energy credits (RECs). The company acknowledged participating in the Georgia Simple Solar program that lets customers buy RECs to compensate for fossil fuel usage and carbon emissions. RECs represent one MWh of electricity from a renewable source that can be bought and sold, and lets an energy user claim credit for renewable energy produced elsewhere. However, researchers have found that companies buying RECs does little to spur renewable energy development and offset emissions. Experts argue that RECs are helping companies inflate their sustainability claims while doing little to drive energy transitions and address the climate crisis. RECs allow companies to claim they are meeting renewable energy targets while continuing to rely on dirty fossil fuel energy. Purchasing RECs is different from directly investing in renewable energy infrastructure, such as by owning solar panels or wind turbines, or signing Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) directly tied to renewable energy generation.\n\nBitcoin Noise Pollution in Georgia\n\nIn addition to the carbon emissions contributing to the climate crisis, Bitcoin mines are also very loud, often disturbing nearby residents. Due to the massive computing power used during the mining process, the computers generate substantial amounts of heat and must therefore be cooled to avoid damaging the equipment. Cooling systems often involve industrial-grade fans and air conditioning units that\u2014when combined with the constant operation of mining rigs\u2014result in persistent noise. The relentless hum of these machines can extend far beyond the confines of the mining facilities, unfortunately impacting surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nCommunities across the South have experienced this unexpected noisy intrusion into their daily lives, as residents from Arkansas to Tennessee report disruptions right outside their homes. For example, residents of Adel, Georgia have been plagued by nonstop noise from Bitcoin mines. The incessant drone of fans and machinery, often louder than the recommended cap of 70 decibels, goes beyond mere inconvenience: prolonged exposure to loud noise can have negative effects on people\u2019s mental and physical well-being, interfering with sleep schedules, increasing stress levels, and contributing to long-term health issues like cardiovascular disease.\n\nMany of CleanSpark\u2019s facilities in Georgia operate with the same loud air-cooling processes. Thus, the Sandersville mine may bring disruptive noise to nearby residents, and students and faculty at the Oconee Fall Line Technical College, a local community college, that is less than half a mile away. CleanSpark\u2019s Norcross mining site utilizes an immersion cooling system that cools computers through submersion in synthetic oil \u2013 a process that reduces the amount of energy used and decreases noise pollution by not relying on fans. Though a quieter and more efficient method, it has so far been limited to the smaller 20 MW site in Norcross.\n\nAs CleanSpark announces a planned expansion of the Sandersville site\u2014a $145 million deal to double the fleet\u2019s mining capacity for a \u201cmassive 150 MW expansion\u201d\u2014there could be more noise and disruption in store for residents.\n\nBitcoin Community Impacts and Unmet Promises\n\nCleanSpark promises to help Sandersville through increased tax revenue and job creation, promises that are appealing in rural communities like Sandersville that relied on a single industry that\u2019s gone bust. Sandersville is unique in having its own electrical grid and has agreed to sell electricity to CleanSpark which generates revenue for the city from the sales and taxes. Some elected city officials have been supportive of the mine and the potential for public revenue. But, the long term impacts remain unknown and there is little data on how the facility impacts local jobs, energy prices, and quality of life.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin mining is not a perfect solution and for many towns and cities hasn\u2019t ushered in an era of renewed prosperity. Mining facilities typically have relatively few long term employees, often hiring only a dozen workers per facility, and may be less labor intensive than other industries and energy-intensive facilities. [4] A National Bureau of Economic Research working paper finds that Bitcoin mining can lead to higher energy prices for nearby residents and small businesses which can outweigh increased tax revenue. In 2022, CleanSpark had only around 80 workers spread across all its facilities. Bitcoin mining is a boom and bust industry tied to the volatile price of Bitcoin \u2013 there was a wave of bankruptcies when Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped in 2021. Miners can also easily relocate their facilities, leaving communities high and dry, and move to wherever they can find the cheapest energy.\n\nThe biggest beneficiaries of Bitcoin mines end up being the companies\u2019 executives , owners and investors who don\u2019t live in the community. Instead of broad economic development and prosperity, many towns with Bitcoin mines have been left with noisy and water-intensive facilities and little public input or oversight about the operations. In Kentucky, officials rejected a Bitcoin mining company\u2019s request for energy price discounts because it would contribute to higher prices for regular ratepayers and strain the grid\u2019s energy supply.\n\nOther communities in Georgia and across the U.S. have become wary and are working to prevent expansion of the Bitcoin mining industry. The city of Forsyth, Georgia blocked a Bitcoin mine, partially due to the potential noise, by denying the company\u2019s requested zoning change. Meanwhile in North Carolina, the Clay County Commission board passed an ordinance blocking commercial crypto mining in the county.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 Data collected from Bloomberg Terminal and based on holdings and share prices as of August 31, 2023.\n\n2 Data collected from Bloomberg Terminal.\n\n3 This data does not include the Sandersville site, which was purchased after the evaluation period.\n\n4 See National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, \u201cWhen Cryptomining Comes to Town: High Electricity-use Spillovers to the Local Economy,\u201d for analysis of the local economic impacts of crypto mining including on electricity prices and the labor market. However, there is a lack of data and reporting about job creation from crypto mining which makes it difficult to reliably assess the economic development impacts."

Geoff Kendrick and the team at the bank conveyed their confidence that the approval of various spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States will serve as the next driving force behind the cryptocurrency's expansion, with these events expected to happen earlier than initially foreseen.\n\nThe bank anticipates that multiple spot ETFs for both BTC and ETH will likely be granted approval in the first quarter of 2024, thereby paving the way for heightened institutional investment. Furthermore, Standard Chartered emphasized the forthcoming Bitcoin \"halving,\" an event that restricts the currency's supply and is predicted to occur in late April 2024, as an additional factor that could contribute to potential price increases.\n\nStandard Chartered originally predicted BTC will hit $120,000 by end of next year, attributing Bitcoin's triumph to its status as a reputable safe haven asset. The bank maintains BTC's dominance, stating: \u201cBTC\u2019s dominance remains intact \u2013 its share of overall digital assets market cap has increased to 50% from 45% in April.\"\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

The bounce has ignited broader interest in the crypto space sooner than anticipated.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Going forward, then, we expect digital assets' rising overall market cap to be a bigger driver of BTC price upside than a continued rise in BTC dominance within the space,\" Kendrick wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, sales of mined bitcoin have dropped to around 80% in the fourth quarter, as miners tend to hold larger quantities of the token as its price rises.\n\nNew supply will also be diminished by next April's bitcoin halving, a recurring event that reduces the amount of tokens awarded for mining. Typically, prices peak 12-18 months after it occurs, Kendrick said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut a positive surprise is also emerging from the demand side, given the rising likelihood that bitcoin spot ETFs become approved for US markets, he added.\n\n\"We now expect more price upside to materialize before the halving than we previously did, specifically via the earlier-than-expected introduction of US spot ETFs. This suggests a risk that the USD 100,000 level could be reached before end-2024,\" Kendrick wrote.\n\nThat's as the SEC's attempts to block spot ETFs have suffered a number of court losses. The ETFs would bring fresh capital into bitcoin, as they would allow traditional brokerage accounts access to the cryptocurrency.\n\nFalling Treasury yields can further propel bitcoin, given that crypto tends to be a very long-term trade, Kendrick added. The 30-year yield has dropped to 4.60% from last month's high of 5.17%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStandard Chartered's bullishness was recently joined by analysts at Bernstein, who predicted that bitcoin could hit $150,000 by mid-2025 given similar supply reasons."

        "content": "Crypto investors are awaiting Security & Exchange Commission (SEC) approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, which could unlock a surge of capital investment in the crypto space. However, this isn't the first time that crypto news created a stir of hype around digital assets, but is this time truly different?\n\nMarkus Thielen, DeFiResearch.com Head of Research, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss what this ETF approval could mean for bitcoin and the crypto space, and why he feels that if approved, it could potentially reach a high price target.\n\n\"I think, to put it in numbers, there's around $120 billion US dollars in precious metals ETFs in the US, so that means in gold and in silver, and if you just move 10-20% of those and shift them over into bitcoin you have certainly sort of something in the range of like $25 billion of inflow,\" Thielen says. \"And we calculated this might have an impact of every $1 billion dollars of 4% impact on the price , so we might actually see kind of a price towards $57,000.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Now, Marcus, this isn't the first time that we've been waiting for this, you know, a big catalyst for bitcoin. And as you talk about the spot bitcoin ETF, other countries that have launched it didn't see a massive rally. Why will this time be different?\n\nMARKUS THIELEN: Well, the US is, of course, the largest pool of capital. And of course, ETFs are only really established in the US. You know, we have seen this a long time, you know, in Asia, how Asia tried to establish ETFs. But people don't really use them, and I think this is because the investor base is very different for the US market than anywhere else.\n\nAnd the US is really dominated by a lot of institutions. And those institutions are using ETFs really in their asset allocation. Of course, we have the registered investment advisor community, and estimates vary from-- you know, they managed 5 trillion to even more. But if they move like one of those-- 1% of those 5 trillion, that's like 50 billion into bitcoin, right?\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd I think that could have like a big impact because we sort of can calculate if the market cap changes, you know, what might be the implications for the price of bitcoin. And what has really changed is really that we have, you know, certain judges telling around the-- telling the SEC around the grayscale lawsuit to go back and reevaluate their estimates.\n\nWe're having BlackRock as, you know, the largest asset manager in the world also filing for a bitcoin ETF. So I think the pressure is really building. And then there is an overall sentiment that the market had that the US regulatory regime is trying to clean up the market. So-- and the last missing piece in this puzzle was for example to sort of like eliminate an exchange from the US market that has been known and admitted to had, you know, illicit trading going on.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Marcus, you said even if one of these bitcoin ETFs move that could have a big impact. We're looking at bitcoin roughly at $37,000 right now. What does that move look like? How much higher can it go?\n\nMARKUS THIELEN: Yeah. I think, you know, we have we have heard a false rumor that proved not true where bitcoin rallied 10%, you know, literally in a heartbeat. So we would estimate if a if a spot bitcoin ETF would be approved. Bitcoin could go up easily 20%. And I think you know to put it in numbers, there's around $120 billion USD in precious metals ETFs in the US. So that means in gold and in silver.\n\nAnd if you just move you know 10, 20% of those, shift them over into bitcoin, you know, you have certainly sort of something in the range of like $25 billion of inflow. And we calculated this might have actually an impact of every $1 billion, a 4% impact on the price. So we might actually see kind of a price towards kind of 57,000 we calculated we can see if there an approval for the bitcoin ETF.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: 57,000 in the medium term?\n\nMARKUS THIELEN: In the medium term, yes. I mean, it sounds reasonable, right, when you look at-- you know, we were just at 25,000 like two months ago, and now we're at 37,000. So this is just literally like you know sort of like 12,000 rally that we had, so another 12,000 point rally. You know, it gets us already like two to the 50,000 point area.\n\nSo I think this can easily happen. And again, as I said, if you if you put in kind of the macro tailwinds of the fed pausing, if you compare to the 2017 episode when the CME announced the bitcoin future, I mean, I think there is just a lot of tailwind, and I think there's a lot of pent up demand. And you know, don't forget we have all these ETF providers. They are, of course, doing a lot of marketing. There are a lot of educational.\n\nAnd, you know, Larry Fink as the CEO from blackrock is almost you know every other day on TV and saying how important the bitcoin ETF is. So I think there is a coordinated marketing effort now to really bring prices higher."

        "content": "Finance spawns a lot of weird and wonky words, and while I\u2019ve at least heard of most of them, \u201cuplist\u201d is a new one for me. I encountered it while poking into crypto giant Grayscale\u2019s bid to be first out of the gate with a Bitcoin ETF\u2014an achievement that would likely help the crypto giant nab the lion\u2019s share of a new market expected to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nWhile other firms, notably BlackRock and Fidelity, are seeking a similar prize, Grayscale is the only one in a position to do it by means of an uplist. The term refers to moving a securities listing from an off-brand stock exchange onto a mainstream one. In Grayscale\u2019s case, this would mean moving its GBTC shares from something called OTCQX to the familiar confines of the NYSE, while at the same time converting its jerry-rigged trust product to a regular old ETF.\n\nA source at Grayscale tells me that launching via an uplist means the firm could bring its ETF to market slightly quicker than its competitors\u2014a critical advantage since, historically, the first ETF in a given field sucks up most of the liquidity. I have no idea if this will happen (and would point any diehards to the X feeds of Bloomberg ETF guys Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart or lawyer Scott Johnsson). But it does underscore how much is at stake with the long-awaited arrival of Bitcoin ETFs, which are widely expected to drop in early January based on the whims of the SEC.\n\nMeanwhile, there are other wild cards surrounding Grayscale\u2019s ETF bid, including what the company plans to charge. It\u2019s a safe bet the fee will be lower than the 2% it\u2019s long charged for GBTC, especially as one of its competitors in the ETF race, ARK Invest, says it will charge 0.8%. Competitive dynamics suggest Grayscale would have to match that rate, but the reality is the firm is likely to charge more since most customers tempted to exchange Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF for a competitor\u2019s would set off a tax trip wire\u2014meaning many will choose to grit their teeth and hold instead.\n\nThe final wild card in all this is how many of those currently holding GBTC shares will simply dump them once the ETF drops, and ditch the Bitcoin game altogether. Recall that a sizable group of investors bought Grayscale shares as an arbitrage when they were trading far below the price of Bitcoin in hopes the gap would close. That has happened\u2014the so-called discount has closed from over 40% to 8% and is likely to disappear altogether\u2014meaning some investors are going to take their crypto profits and go take a flier on AI or something else totally unrelated. JPMorgan recently predicted outflows will amount to around $2.7 billion.\n\nAll of this is just conjecture for now. But January, and some real answers, are only weeks away.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nA U.S. judge has for now refused to let Binance\u2019s former CEO return to the United Arab Emirates ahead of his sentencing date in February, and will likely make a decision in the coming days. (Bloomberg)\n\nThe price of several large altcoins, including SUI and Optimism, tumbled ahead of impending \u201cunlock\u201d events that will see a glut of new tokens enter the market.

Investors are waiting to hear if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot bitcoin ETF, with inflows into the cryptocurrency surging the last five weeks. Yahoo Finance Reporter Jared Blikre joins the Live show to break down the numbers and give insight into whether or not this bitcoin rally can continue into next year.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right. Let's take a look at the crypto market because Bitcoin bulls are ready to charge. Bitcoin looking for direction this morning as investors' anticipation over an eventual US spot Bitcoin ETF, has pushed the cryptocurrency higher in the last three months. The question now, though, is whether this rally has staying power into the new year. Jared Blikre joining us with maybe a closer look at some of those technicals and the momentum that we've seen. Jared, what do you think?\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, I'm looking at inflows into Bitcoin and this chart goes back to the beginning of the year. And we are on the ninth straight week of inflows into Bitcoin, approaching about $300 million. This is the highest week of the year. And just looking, we can see a lot of activity over the last five weeks. Why? Whatever happened five weeks ago? We got a huge breakout in price.\n\nAnd let's go to the Bitcoin chart. And let's do a year to date. And we can plot this, you can see we really got going in about mid-October here. And you can even see that better with the candlesticks. We got that huge break above 30,000 and then 35,000. Huge, huge sticking points. And the reason those were sticking points is because there is a lot of price memory.\n\nLet me change this back to a line chart. And you can see we are now firmly in the bottom area of all this price history that we had in 2021. Lots of things sorted out in there. Suffice to say, it's going to take a lot to get through there.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs it going to happen slowly, quickly? Depends on the catalyst. But the regulatory environment finally seems to be getting a little bit more habitable for crypto players. It looks like Binance is probably going to skate with a $4 billion fine. But the industry itself is going to survive. And they've taken their lumps over the last couple of years. For the industry to bounce back now, I'd say yes, the bad, the worst is definitely in the past. And there's a lot of smooth sailing ahead. But exactly how that plays out, it's hard to see.\n\nI think the spot Bitcoin ETF, that's probably priced in. But you never know. There could be another burst of enthusiasm around that. Anecdotally, I will say the only time I get recognized in the streets of New York is when crypto prices are popping, and I'm not getting recognized. So I know we haven't gotten that level-- gotten to that level in this cycle yet.\n\nSEANA SMITH: It's weird. I didn't know you were so tied to the crypto. I never would have guessed that.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Apparently, I am personally levered to Bitcoin prices. I don't know what's in that, but that's the way it happens. So I started getting recognized, yeah, I'll be really bullish, but we're just in the beginning stages right now, guys.\n\nDIANE KING HALL: All right, Jared Blikre. We will have to put a pin in that one and come back to you. We'll watch out for you for your man on the street Bitcoin quote.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: That's a great idea, Diane. Man on the street, person on the street Bitcoin. We're going to do that.\n\nDIANE KING HALL: Exactly. All right, thank you, Jared."

        "content": "00:00\n\nAnd what you will find is it is broadly an update for digital assets really rallying across the board. Bitcoin, one of the ones leading the charge here, up 3.3%. We are now north of $38,000. This is the highest level we have seen for Bitcoin going back to May of 2022. So it's been about a year and a half ether, Of course, taking part in this rally, though it has been lagging behind the recent rally we have seen in Bitcoin in Bitcoin to a large degree, it's up by about 2.9% on the day in that action. And really across the digital asset space, you're seeing tokens moving higher is feeding back into crypto related equities, one of them being Marathon digital. It's higher by about seven and a half percent on the day. And Coinbase generally one I know you're paying a lot of attention to, it's up by about 6% at this point in the session. Coinbase has really been lighting up the internet as well. A lot of people talking about it on the platform now known as X. And remember, it has not only been up every day since we've seen struggles that big multibillion dollar settlement over at big rival Binance, it's actually been on quite a tear, Kelly, since it's hit its October lows again, Of course, some of that some of that is helped by that love in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But really, it's almost an 80% rise since it retested its lows in October. And if you pull out the chart even more, you would see that it's nearly quadrupled since its December lows that it hit last year. It's too soon to see just how much those troubles over Binance have meant over at Coinbase, what it's meant in terms of flows and customers moving over. But soon enough, time will tell."

However, the blockchain analysis firm added that \"the magnitude of unrealized profit remains modest, and is not yet sufficient for long-term investors to divest.\"\n\nAccording the Bitfinex, over 16.3 million bitcoin are currently in profit.\n\n\"The current percentage of bitcoin held in profit is substantially higher than the all-time average of 74%,\" Bitfinex analysts said. The report added that this indicates the market is in a relatively strong position, \"with a large majority of bitcoin holders seeing positive returns on their investment.\"\n\nRecent data from The Block's dashboard also signaled the increased strength of the bitcoin market. For three days last week, the 7-day moving average of total transactions fees on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks flipped in favor of BTC -2.77% for the first time since November 2020.\n\nLong-term holders are accumulating\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nBitfinex analysts said approximately 70% of the total circulating supply of bitcoin has not moved in the past year. This marks a new all-time high, according to the report.\n\n\"This is providing a source of upward pressure as increasing demand chases limited supply,\" the analysts added.\n\nIn a note sent to The Block, Bitfinex analysts saw contrasting behavior between the current dynamics of long-term holders and those observed in past cycles.\n\n\"In the current cycle, there have been fewer dips and oscillations in long-term holder supply due to spending, indicating a trend of continuously increasing supply. This suggests a degree of supply tightness in the bitcoin market regardless of long-term holder profitability on a pretty decent scale,\" the analysts said.\n\nThe Bitfinex analysts concluded their report by saying present conditions support the thesis that the market is in the early stages of a bull market.\n\n\"Bitcoin continues to show strength while still in a range for the time being,\" the Bitfinex analysts added. It was trading at $37,093 at 12:40 p.m. ET, according to The Block data."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Action Indicates More Upside Could Soon Arrive - ETF Trends",
        "content": "With equity markets open just a half day, the day after Thanksgiving is usually a noneventful day in financial markets. However, something notable did occur last Friday: Bitcoin jumped to its highest prices in 18 months.\n\nBitcoin surged above $38,000 on November 24 for the first time since May 2022. In what could be a catalyst for exchange traded funds such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) , bitcoin\u2019s albeit brief history indicates that when the cryptocurrency moves to $38,000, momentum will carry it beyond $40,000.\n\nSATO\u2019s largest holding is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The rest of the ETF\u2019s portfolio is a slew of crypto-correlated equities. In other words, momentum for the largest digital currency can and often does matriculate down to assets such as SATO.\n\nOther Indicators of More Potential Gains for SATO\n\nSome investors want to assess the possibility of more near-term upside for bitcoin and SATO. The futures market might offer some clues.\n\n\u201cAs for derivatives markets linked to Bitcoin, we may witness more momentum tomorrow and in the coming days. According to data provided by Deribit, tomorrow will be the execution date for what are equivalent of more than $4 billion worth of options contracts for Bitcoin, which they are more than 107 thousand contracts, which represent part of more than 14 billion options outstanding,\u201d noted Samer Hasn, an analyst at XS.com. \u201cThis coincides with a further record rise in the value of open interests for Bitcoin futures contracts, which reached approximately $15.93 billion, which represents a new highest level not seen since April of last year.\u201d\n\nAnother point in favor of SATO is that even with this year\u2019s rally by bitcoin, one that\u2019s recently intensified amid speculation that U.S. regulators will soon approve a spot bitcoin ETF, is that many cryptomarket participants aren\u2019t selling into this rally. Rather, they\u2019re standing pat or adding to exisiing positions, expressing devotion to the digital asset.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s very encouraging for Bitcoin right now is 70% of on-chain supply has remain dormant for a year, a new record which tells us long-term Bitcoin holders are steadfast in their determination. It seems little will shake their resolve until prices are much higher,\u201d said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner at crypto lender Nexo, in an interview with Barron\u2019s. \u201cBitcoin is on track for its third consecutive monthly gain. The last time it rose September through November in 2015 and 2016 it went on to log another positive month in December.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) resumed its rally in November before taking a dip earlier last week. However, the cryptocurrency rebounded to hit a new high for 2023 on Nov 24. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s most prominent cryptocurrency, hit the $38,000 mark for the first time this year on Friday.\n\nThis is the first time the cryptocurrency has traded past the $38,000 mark since May 2022. This year has been great for the cryptocurrency market after a disappointing 2022, with Bitcoin leading from the front.\n\nBitcoin finally settled just above $37,400. The recent rally marks the resurgence of cryptocurrencies. Not only Bitcoin but also other cryptocurrencies have made a solid turnaround this year.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has gained 126.2% year to date, Ethereum (ETH) closed above $2,070 on Friday and has now surged 74.2% year to date. Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have jumped 57.5% and 10.3%, respectively, year to date.\n\nThere have been several factors contributing to the cryptocurrency rally. One major factor is the resolution of legal issues faced by Binance.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has reportedly agreed to plead guilty to federal criminal charges.\n\nThis resolution has restored confidence among investors, alleviating concerns about the exchange's future and is also helping the broader cryptocurrency market stabilize.\n\nMany now believe that with the Binance investigation resolved, the path for a Bitcoin ETF approval will now be clear. Market participants believe that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF is likely to play a major catalyst in driving the cryptocurrency market to new highs.\n\nSeparately, the Federal Reserve has maintained its hawkish approach and the minutes of the November FOMC meeting suggest that officials are still open to more hikes. However, as of now, they are more inclined toward maintaining a cautious approach.\n\nInvestors are, however, confident that the Federal Reserve will refrain from hiking interest rates in December as inflation declined further in October. Higher interest rates usually have an adverse effect on growth-focused sectors like technology, consumer discretionary industries, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc.

        "content": "ARK's Grayscale Share Sale Signals Bitcoin ETF Optimism\n\nIn the latest sign of increasing optimism for a spot bitcoin approval, ARK Invest, the asset-management firm led by famed investor Cathie Wood, shed about $5 million worth of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares last week, amid a narrowing of the trust\u2019s discount to 8.06%, its lowest in over two years as of Nov. 24.\n\n\n\nThe investment firm\u2019s ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) sold about 163,000 shares in the past week, according to data from Bloomberg. The sales came as the price of bitcoin, which has nearly doubled this year, temporarily surpassed $38,000 for the first time in about a year and a half.\n\n\n\nDespite ARK offloading the shares, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas clarified in a post on the X social-media platform formerly known as Twitter that he doesn\u2019t think the move indicates a lack of bullishness on the part of ARK.\n\n\u201cWith ARK you gotta look at weightings history before you begin interpretation,\u201d he tweeted in response to what he said was \"another article on how ARK is selling GBTC and how that means they aren\u2019t really bullish on BTC and/or they making room for ARKB. Neither is true.\"\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Race\n\nLast week, ARK was the first of the major firms to disclose a fee for their prospective spot bitcoin ETF, according to a filing.\n\nMany firms have recently added updates to their spot bitcoin ETF filings, including WisdomTree Investments on Nov. 16, signaling that conversations with the Securities and Exchange Commission are steadily progressing toward a potential approval.\n\nThe SEC, which delayed its decision in September, must decide on ARK's application by Jan. 11, the earliest deadline for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhile the SEC has approved cryptocurrency ETFs that track digital asset futures, the largest being the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the agency has thus far denied and delayed its decision on applications for ETFs that track physically backed cryptocurrency on the grounds of market manipulation. Despite investors excitement for a spot fund, the SEC has continued to delay its decisions on applications, most recently punting on a filing from Brazilian cryptocurrency firm Hashdex.\n\nStory continues\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "content": "A Bitcoin BTC -3.25% user who claims to be the victim of the record-breaking $3 million transaction fee paid last week says they were hacked.\n\nOn Thursday, a Bitcoin user appeared to have accidentally paid an 83.65 BTC transaction fee \u2014 worth over $3.1 million. It set a new record in U.S. dollar terms for a single Bitcoin transaction, more than six times the previous record $500,000 fee paid in September.\n\nOn Friday, the self-proclaimed victim created a new X account under a handle similar to the fee amount paid, \u201c@83_5BTC,\u201d claiming it was their bitcoin used to pay the high fee. \u201cI created a new cold wallet, transferred 139 BTC to it and it got transferred out to another wallet immediately,\u201d 83_5BTC said. \u201cI can only imagine that someone was running a script on that wallet and that the script had a weird fee calculation.\u201d\n\nThe transaction paid the 83.65 BTC fee to transfer 55.77 BTC ($2.1 million). The pre-transaction balance was 139.42 BTC ($5.2 million). \u201c55 BTC gone forever. 83.5 BTC to be decided,\u201d 83_5BTC added.\n\nSignature checks out\n\n83_5BTC signed a message from the Bitcoin address in question saying, \"@83_5BTC is the owner of the funds that paid the high fee.\" The signature was verified by Mononaut, the pseudonymous developer behind the Bitcoin explorer Mempool. \u201cThe signature checks out, @83_5BTC apparently controls the key that paid that 83.7 BTC fee,\u201d Mononaut said today. Casa co-founder and CTO Jameson Lopp also verified the signature.\n\nHowever, if the wallet is compromised, the message could have also been signed by an attacker, Mononaut added. The transaction was mined by AntPool in block 818,087, according to the blockchain explorer Blockchair. The previous record $500,000 fee paid in September was subsequently identified as a \u201cfat finger\u201d overpayment by the crypto services provider Paxos. F2Pool, the miner facilitating that transaction, agreed to reimburse that fee to Paxos. It is unclear whether AntPool would be willing to come to a similar agreement, but if it did, the Bitcoin mining pool would need another way to verify the victim\u2019s identity.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nCommunity member \u201cniftydev\u201d said they knew the person behind the 83_5BTC account and claimed they were the owner, not an attacker.\n\nAntPool has not yet publicly commented on the transaction and did not return a request for comment from The Block.\n\nLow-entropy wallet\n\nAccording to Mononaut, the most likely cause was a low-entropy wallet, meaning it was created with insufficient randomness, making it vulnerable to hacking. The transaction was quickly fee-bumped using replace-by-fee (RBF) \u2014 a Bitcoin protocol feature that allows a sender to increase the transaction fee on an unconfirmed transaction, enabling it to be processed more quickly by the network. If it was indeed a low-entropy wallet, multiple attackers could have been competing to steal the funds, Mononaut suggested, explaining the high fee, with scripts configured to spend a significant proportion of the transaction to hinder competitors.\n\nMononaut later noted that the fee paid was exactly 60% of the total 139.42 BTC stolen, and the potential attacker also swept 0.001 BTC from the same address, paying 0.0006 BTC in fees. \u201cThis, combined with the speed of the theft, seems like reasonable evidence for an automated script set to pay a fixed 60% of the value in fees to steal coins sent to vulnerable addresses,\u201d Mononaut said, with the 60% fee replacing an initial fee worth exactly 51% of the transaction which could have been from a different attacker or part of the same strategy.\n\n\u201cLet this be a reminder not to take shortcuts with your entropy, and ideally to use multisig for very large sums,\u201d Mononaut added."

        "title": "11th anniversary of Bitcoin's first halving: From $12 to $37,000 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, experienced its first-ever halving 11 years ago today. As the community celebrates the anniversary of the first Bitcoin halving, it\u2019s timely to revisit some of Bitcoin\u2019s historical milestones ahead of the next halving expected in April 2024.\n\nThe first Bitcoin transaction occurred nearly 15 years ago on Jan. 3, 2009, a few months after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, published the Bitcoin white paper in October 2008.\n\nOn Nov. 28, 2012 \u2014 three years and 10 months after Bitcoin\u2019s first block was mined \u2014 the first-ever halving event took place. At the time, BTC traded at around $12, according to data from StatMuse, or 308,200% below Bitcoin\u2019s current price, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThough Bitcoin\u2019s halving and the digital currency\u2019s 21 million supply cap are not directly described in Nakamoto\u2019s white paper, the document still hints at certain mechanisms to control the creation of new BTC. The white paper reads:\n\n\u201cTo compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they\u2019re generated too fast, the difficulty increases.\u201d\n\nUnlike some basic information in the Bitcoin white paper, the halving aspect is mentioned in the Bitcoin source code. The halving is specifically available on the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository on the validation.cpp file and indicates the miner\u2019s block subsidy is \u201ccut in half every 210,000 blocks, which will occur every four years.\u201d\n\nA Bitcoin halving-related snippet from the Bitcoin Core repository. Source: GitHub\n\nThe Bitcoin halving mechanism had been programmed into the BTC mining algorithm to counteract inflation by maintaining scarcity.\n\nBefore the first halving occurred, miners were compensated with as much as 50 BTC per block. After the first halving event in 2012, the subsidy was slashed to 25 BTC, followed by the second halving in 2016, which reduced the subsidy to 12.5 BTC. The most recent Bitcoin halving occurred in 2020, cutting the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.\n\nAs Bitcoin halvings significantly increase the cryptocurrency\u2019s scarcity, the Bitcoin price cycle has been historically impacted by halvings. Just a year after its first-ever halving, Bitcoin had risen to nearly $1,000, while the second halving triggered a 350% surge during the year after the event, with BTC subsequently rallying to then all-time highs of nearly $20,000 in December 2017.\n\nRelated: Crypto community begins Bitcoin halving countdown as milestone date nears\n\nIn the aftermath of the third Bitcoin halving, BTC surged to its all-time high of almost $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nThe anniversary of the first Bitcoin halving comes as the cryptocurrency community awaits the fourth Bitcoin halving, which is now expected to occur on April 17, 2024. Many Bitcoin advocates are especially bullish on the Bitcoin price in 2024 amid growing expectations that United States securities regulators could finally approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe 2024 halving won\u2019t be the last one, though. Bitcoin miner reward is expected to be halved 34 times until it reaches 0 BTC after all 21 million Bitcoin are mined. Based on the current schedule, the maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin will be reached around 2140.\n\nMagazine: 5,050 Bitcoin for $5 in 2009: Helsinki\u2019s claim to crypto fame"

        "content": "Bitcoin's price may be due for one more pullback in the coming weeks and that could be a good opportunity to buy more of the cryptocurrency before its next leg up, according to Wolfe Research. The flagship cryptocurrency has been riding a wave of positive momentum driven primarily by enthusiasm surrounding the prospects for regulatory approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. After stagnating around $30,000 for much of the year, bitcoin has steadily climbed to new 2023 highs in recent weeks \u2013 breaking past $38,000 on Friday, after reaching $37,000 just a couple weeks prior. The next stop could be as high as $40,000, according to Wolfe's Rob Ginsberg. \"[Bitcoin] now sits within reach of having retraced 50% of the decline off its highs,\" Ginsberg wrote in a note last week. \"With ETF excitement growing and money continuing to pour into the space, we feel there's plenty of upside left to be had. However \u2026 near term price action may provide for one more buying opportunity before continuing higher.\" BTC.CM= 1Y mountain Bitcoin (BTC) now has retraced nearly 50% of the decline off its 2021 all-time high. \"As MACD [moving average convergence/divergence] rolls over and overbought conditions come in, all signs point toward a near-term pullback,\" he added. \"We would use it as a buying opportunity as the next move higher likely takes price above $40,000.\" Ginsberg pointed to bitcoin's \"wildly impressive\" year in total, with a year-to-date gain of 120% \u2013 despite months of lethargy in the spring and summer. Although on Tuesday bitcoin was back down to about $37,200, according to Coin Metrics, it has still retraced nearly 50% of its decline from roughly $69,300 in November 2021 to about $15,200 at the end of 2022. Meanwhile, ether is retesting and consolidating at the $2,000 level, which it hit earlier this month for the first time since April and which has proven a ceiling for the second largest crypto coin for more than a year. Ginsberg said ether is \"right on the cusp\" of a breakout. \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCharles Hoskinson of Cardano conducted another AMA livestream.\n\nHoskinson took aim at the SEC for its alleged Bitcoin favoritism.\n\nHe also pushed back on the accusation that ADA had an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).\n\nCardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently criticized the SEC\u2019s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, accusing the agency of giving Bitcoin a \u201ccomplete pass\u201d while subjecting other crypto assets like Cardano\u2019s ADA token to much harsher scrutiny.\n\nSEC Treatment of ADA a \u201cPathetic Joke\u201d\n\nIn a fiery livestream , Hoskinson called the differential treatment an \u201cabsolutely pathetic joke,\u201d demanding the SEC explain why Bitcoin is viewed as sufficiently decentralized while cryptos like ADA are labeled securities. \u201cExplain it to me [the difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies] like I am five years old. Run the Howey test!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you subpoena and attack about three different entities, you could perform a 51% attack on Bitcoin because that\u2019s the way the hash power works,\u201d Hoskinson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s decentralized, apparently.\u201d\n\nThe Cardano founder argued Bitcoin is not as decentralized as commonly believed since controlling over half the network\u2019s hash rate would only require coercion of a few large mining pools.\n\nCharles Hoskinson GOES OFF on SEC & Bitcoin getting a pass while Cardano $ADA & crypto has to suffer. \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/Vm1u9jGrIr \u2014 Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) November 27, 2023\n\nHoskinson also rebutted claims that Cardano had an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) token sale, which could justify stricter regulatory oversight.\n\n\u201cThere was an airdrop onto a distribution, and then thousands of people who never met each other traded Ada on exchanges and used Cardano for their projects,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cA voucher sale of a different asset outside of the United States, priced in Yen, settled in Bitcoin, explained in Japanese to Japanese citizens, and without a single US participant does not constitute an ICO of Ada.\u201d\n\nICOs are controversial in the context of whether or not cryptocurrencies like ADA and Bitcoin are securities. Regulators are more likely to view a cryptocurrency that had an ICO as a security due to their shared characteristics, including the expectation of profit and the fact that an ICO could be construed as an investment contract.\n\nThe debate about which cryptocurrency is a security is a live one for Hoskinson and Cardano. ADA has repeatedly been mentioned as a \u201ccrypto asset security\u201d in SEC documents. Most recently in a case involving the cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken.\n\nCharles Hoskinson Also Praised Javier Milei\n\nIn the end, Hoskinson attributed the SEC\u2019s uneven treatment to pure favoritism, sarcastically praising Bitcoin\u2019s \u201corange pill moonboys\u201d for receiving preferential treatment from regulators.\n\n\u201cIt would be funny if not for the fact that hundreds of millions of dollars of legal fees have been exhausted in this pyrrhic war that\u2019s being fought on the industry,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also predicted the SEC would lose case after case while the industry continued growing before the regulator\u2019s attack finally ended \u2013 without apology or recompense.\n\nHe vowed that the industry would continue fighting unwinnable court battles until the SEC\u2019s overreach was finally reined in.\n\nHoskinson went on to argue that the entire reason cryptocurrencies were created was to \u201creestablish the social contract\u201d in the face of a \u201chorrifically broken\u201d system where regulators like the SEC waste hundreds of millions harassing the industry while remaining \u201cunaccountable\u201d themselves.\n\nThe Cardano founder praised libertarian lawmakers as the only people improving the situation by \u201cunraveling the government\u201d through cryptos that provide an alternative to legacy finance.\n\nHe also had kind words for Argentina\u2019s new anarcho-capitalist President, Javier Milei. \u201cSomebody who says the government is the problem and not the solution to the problem\u2026 I like that guy.\u201d\n\nHoskinson also spoke enthusiastically about bringing Milei into the pro-blockchain movement, seeing the fiery politician as somewhat of a kindred spirit. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get there, and I think Argentina has a chance to lead the world.\u201d"

This would help create a self-sustaining cycle for renewable energy expansion.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has drawn criticism from environmentalists for the vast amounts of electricity required to support its network and mint new units of the cryptocurrency, with recent analysis from the University of Cambridge estimating that it uses roughly the same amount of electricity as Poland.\n\nThe plummeting costs of renewable energy mean bitcoin miners are increasingly turning to solar, wind and hydro sources to power their operations.\n\n\u201cIn its current status, the infrastructure that supports the Bitcoin protocol cannot be sustained, but the beauty of the protocol is that the incentive structure will force miners to adopt the cheapest form of electricity, which in the near future will be renewable energy,\u201d Don Wyper, COO of DigitalMint, told The Independent last year.\n\nThe latest study, titled \u2018From mining to mitigation: how bitcoin can support renewable energy development and climate action\u2019, was published in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) briefly reached $38,000 on Nov. 24 but faced formidable resistance at the price level. On Nov. 27, Bitcoin price traded below $37,000, which is unchanged from a week ago.\n\nWhat is eye-catching is the unwavering strength of BTC derivatives, which signals that bulls remain steadfast in their intentions.\n\nAn intriguing development is unfolding in China as Tether (USDT) trades below its fair value in the local currency, the yuan. This discrepancy often arises due to differing expectations between professional traders engaged in derivatives and retail clients involved in the spot market.\n\nHow have regulations impacted Bitcoin derivatives?\n\nTo gauge the exposure of whales and arbitrage desks using Bitcoin derivatives, one must assess BTC options volume. By examining the put (sell) and call (buy) options, we can estimate the prevailing bullish or bearish sentiment.\n\nDeribit BTC options put-to-call volume ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nSince Nov. 22, put options have consistently lagged behind call options in volume, by an average of 40%. This suggests a diminished demand for protective measures \u2014 a surprising development given the intensified regulatory scrutiny following Binance\u2019s plea deal with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s lawsuit against the Kraken exchange.\n\nWhile investors may not foresee disruptions to Binance\u2019s services, the likelihood of further regulatory actions against exchanges serving U.S. clients has surged. Additionally, individuals who previously relied on obscuring their activity might now think twice as the DOJ gains access to historical transactions.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s uncertain whether the arrangement former CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao struck with authorities will extend to other unregulated exchanges and payment gateways. In summary, the repercussions of recent regulatory actions remain uncertain, and the prevailing sentiment is pessimistic, with investors fearing additional constraints and potential actions targeting market makers and stablecoin issuers.\n\nTo determine if the Bitcoin options market is an anomaly, let\u2019s examine BTC futures contracts, specifically the monthly ones \u2014 preferred by professional traders due to their fixed funding rate in neutral markets. Typically, these instruments trade at a 5% to 10% premium to account for the extended settlement period.\n\nBitcoin 30-day futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nBetween Nov. 24 and 26, the BTC futures premium flirted with excessive optimism, hovering around 12%. However, by Nov. 27, it dipped to 9% as Bitcoin\u2019s price tested the $37,000 support \u2014 a neutral level but close to the bullish threshold.\n\nRetail traders are less optimistic after ETF hopium fades\n\nMoving on to retail interest, there is a growing sense of apathy due to the absence of a short-term positive trigger, such as the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

        "title": "The Risks of Stablecoins: Exploring The Bitcoin-Dollar With Mark Goodwin - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Understanding Stablecoins\n\nStablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that aims to maintain a stable value by pegging it to another asset, such as a fiat currency, precious metal, or a basket of assets. Stablecoins have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their potential to address some of the limitations of traditional cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is known for its price volatility, stablecoins provide a more price stable alternative, making them suitable for various use cases.\n\nOne of the most prominent ways stablecoins are marketed is in regards to their ability to act as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset space. By pegging their value to a stable asset, stablecoins provide a reliable medium of exchange and store of value. This stability makes stablecoins more attractive for merchants and consumers alike, as they can confidently transact without worrying about sudden price fluctuations.\n\nStablecoins also theoretically offer benefits in terms of transaction speed and cost-efficiency. Traditional banking systems often involve lengthy settlement times and high fees for cross-border transactions. In contrast, stablecoins can facilitate near-instantaneous transactions with lower fees, making them an attractive option for global commerce.\n\nFurthermore, stablecoins can serve as a hedge against inflation in countries with unstable economies or volatile fiat currencies. By holding stablecoins backed by stronger currencies, individuals and businesses can protect their wealth from devaluation and maintain a more stable financial position.\n\nIt is important to note that there are different types of stablecoins, each with its own mechanism for maintaining stability. Some stablecoins are backed by reserves of the pegged asset, while others rely on algorithms and smart contracts to regulate supply and demand.\n\nThe Concept of The Bitcoin-Dollar\n\nBitcoin offers a politically and neutral platform and asset, but this comes with the cost of high volatility in terms of price and purchasing power. Stablecoins on the other hand offer an ultimately centralized and controlled platform and asset, with the gained benefit of stability in price and purchasing power. These two technologies in a way represent two sides of the same coin, the yin and the yang. In addition to that, the largest market for Bitcoin in the world is the US dollar. Worldwide if people are attempting to ascertain the price of Bitcoin, they are most likely to look at its price in dollars. Those markets are also highly likely to be traded against stablecoins rather than the dollar proper outside of US jurisdictions.\n\nThis creates a degree of symbiosis between the two because of that. Wherever Bitcoin goes, the dollar follows in some sense. The dollar price of Bitcoin, and very frequently the use of stablecoins, follows Bitcoin everywhere it goes. The reality of this dynamic ensures with a high likelihood that everywhere Bitcoin becomes adopted due to unstable local currencies and economies, dollar based stablecoins will likely be adopted to some degree.\n\nGiven this dynamic, it\u2019s possible that the growth in adoption of Bitcoin may actually help facilitate the growth and stability of the US dollar in the process. If growing adoption of Bitcoin leads to growing adoption of stablecoins, and stablecoins necessarily require holding dollars or a dollar equivalent like a treasury bond to back them, then the narrative of Bitcoin usurping and undermining the dollar might wind up falling flat. At least for the foreseeable future.\n\nMark Goodwin's Perspective on Stablecoins\n\nWho is Mark Goodwin?\n\nMark Goodwin is the author of The Bitcoin-Dollar and Bitcoin expert and advocate for decentralized financial systems. With extensive experience in the industry, Goodwin has offered valuable insights into the world of stablecoins and their potential impact on the financial ecosystem.\n\nGoodwin's Critiques of Stablecoins\n\nGoodwin's critiques of stablecoins stem from concerns about centralization and the potential for abuse or manipulation. While stablecoins aim to provide stability, the reliance on trusted custodians and centralized reserves introduces counterparty risks. Goodwin suggests that further efforts of perpetuating the US Treasury market due to stablecoin issuers purchasing Treasuries en masse should be met with extreme caution and apprehension from Bitcoiners.\n\nThe Risks Associated with Stablecoins\n\nPrice Stability Concerns\n\nWhile stablecoins attempt to maintain a stable value, there can still be risks associated with maintaining the peg to the underlying asset. Factors such as market conditions, liquidity disparities, and redemption pressures can challenge the stability of stablecoins. If these risks are not adequately managed, it can result in deviation from the peg and potential loss of trust from users.\n\nRegulatory Challenges\n\nThe regulatory landscape surrounding stablecoins is still developing, and this poses challenges for their widespread adoption. Regulatory authorities worldwide are closely monitoring stablecoins, considering their potential implications for financial stability and consumer protection. It is essential for stablecoin projects to navigate these regulatory challenges effectively to ensure their long-term success.\n\nPotential for Market Manipulation\n\nStablecoins, with their substantial market capitalization and liquidity, can be targets for market manipulation. The rapid expansion of the cryptocurrency space, coupled with limited oversight, creates opportunities for individuals or entities to manipulate stablecoin markets for personal gain. Enhanced transparency and regulatory frameworks can help mitigate these risks and ensure market integrity.\n\nStablecoins attempt to offer the promise of stability and accessibility in the world of decentralized finance. However, they also come with risks and challenges that need to be carefully addressed. As the market evolves and regulatory frameworks develop, stablecoins have the potential to further push the dollar\u2019s reach across the world and thus careful considerations are essential to mitigate the associated risks of further centralizing the global economy within a select few private capital creators.\n\nNews of the Week (11/20/2023 - 11/24/2023)\n\nWho is Javier Milei? The Argentinian President that everyone is talking about.\n\nWhile labeled as \u201cFar Right\u201d, \u201cThe Wig\u201d, \u201cCrazy\u201d, \u201cThe Lion\u201d, \u201cRadical\u201d, \u201cThe Libertarian\u201d are some of the words used to describe him he is more than meets the eye.\n\nBefore becoming President of Latin America's 2nd largest economy. He lived a multi facet life. He was a soccer player in the 1980\u2019s, an economist, and playing in a rock band called Everest.\n\nHe rose to prominence as the leader of the political party \u201cLa Libertad Avanza\u201d (Freedom Advances) and gained attention in politics for his provocative style.\n\nNow 53 years old, Milei identifies as an anarcho-capitalist and holds two postgraduate degrees, having graduated from University of Belgrano.\n\nMilei identifies as a proponent of economic liberalism and adheres to the Austrian school of economic thought, which advocates minimal government intervention in the economy and deregulation of markets.\n\nSome of Milei\u2019s key proposals are as followed:\n\n\n\nHe strongly advocates for dollarizing Argentina\u2019s economy and intends to shut down the central bank, holding it responsible for the country's high inflation.\n\nHe advocates for dramatic cuts in social spending, which is a controversial stance in a country with a history of social welfare programs.\n\nHe has suggested cutting ties with Argentina\u2019s two most important trade partners, Brazil and China, a move that could have significant economic implications.\n\nHis campaign is marked by symbolic acts, such as brandishing a chainsaw to symbolize the fiscal adjustments he deems necessary.\n\nSome critics view Milei as an unstable leader for an economically unstable country. While others view him as the salvation to Argentina\u2019s never ending inflation, corruption, rising state debts, and looming recession.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Funding fees bridge the difference between spot prices and prices of futures contracts of an asset by increasing liquidation risks faced by traders. A consistently high and positive funding rate implies there is a bullish sentiment among market participants and there is an expectation of a price hike. A consistently negative funding rate for an asset implies a bearish sentiment, indicating that traders expect the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to fall and a bearish trend reversal is likely to occur.\n\nHigher Open Interest is associated with higher liquidity and new capital inflow to the market. This is considered the equivalent of increase in efficiency and the ongoing trend continues. When Open Interest decreases, it is considered a sign of liquidation in the market, investors are leaving and the overall demand for an asset is on a decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Adrian Zdu\u0144czyk, Bitcoin\u2019s breakout target is the range between $39,000 and $40,000. The analyst has identified the range between $25,000 and $32,000, as the trading range for Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin price performance has flattened over the past two weeks after the BTC run up to $38,400 on November 24.

        "title": "Futures will be the best crypto game in town even after a Bitcoin spot ETF - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has long been the home of crypto for traditional finance investors, and this is unlikely to change \u2014 even with the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nActivity on the CME has expanded significantly over the past 12 months. The CME now sees more Bitcoin (BTC) futures trading than the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange, Binance. Open BTC interest on the CME now makes up 24.7% of the entire market, making it the top Bitcoin futures trading venue in the world\n\nWhile some of this activity is almost certainly linked to anticipation of approval for a spot ETF, the launch of one or more will not lead to a reduction of activity in the futures market. In fact, futures trading is likely to expand rather than contract when the SEC finally gives BlackRock et. al. the green light.\n\nRelated: History tells us we\u2019re in for a strong bull market with a hard landing\n\nThere is no doubt that a spot ETF will bring large flows of institutional money into the sector. However, it will not change the basic fundamentals of Bitcoin liquidity. As we know, the supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. That means the futures market is the only place where real trade action can happen.\n\nThe CME has been successfully used by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and others to trade cryptocurrency instruments for years, and they have been using futures to do so. Futures remain the instrument of choice because liquidity is the main issue in the spot market. These huge institutional investors could buy bitcoin at any time, but liquidity remains the chief drawback - not the lack of a spot ETF.\n\nBitcoin options open interest, June 2020-November 2023. Source: CoinGlass\n\nInstitutional investors that use the CME are also highly sophisticated. As such, any fund manager that takes a position in BlackRock\u2019s spot ETF, for example, will want to hedge that position using futures on the CME. Accordingly, we can expect activity on the CME to grow almost in lockstep with the growth in spot ETFs.\n\nFutures are also \u2014 as we know \u2014 a speculative instrument, and there is perhaps no market that is more speculative than cryptocurrency. As the asset class gains more legitimacy and credibility with the approval of a spot ETF, we will see more investors interested in all corners of digital asset trading.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: A $600B tipping point for crypto\n\nAdventurous day traders who may have stuck to the foreign-exchange market in the past will likely start to venture into Bitcoin and other crypto instruments. And they will exercise this interest through the CME. Indeed, I suspect we will see increasing interest in perpetual swaps and other types of derivative instruments in the sector next year.\n\nCrypto futures also benefit from clearer and more consistent regulation, which is another major factor here. While the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) looks after futures, nobody has yet fully decided who looks after the crypto spot market from a regulatory perspective, and this remains a problem. Applications for these Bitcoin spot ETFs are currently sitting on the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s desk, but as has become abundantly clear, Chairman Gary Gensler is a big fan of ambiguity.\n\nClear regulation is leading to obvious success in cryptocurrency futures, while the spot market is being hindered by regulatory opacity. And so, while the approval of an ETF is just a matter of time at this stage, we still don\u2019t know how much time. While we are waiting, the futures market remains an extremely enticing trading ground for institutional investors.\n\nLucas Kiely is the chief investment officer for Yield App, where he oversees investment portfolio allocations and leads the expansion of a diversified investment product range.

BTC price predictions diverge wildly\n\nIn line with the broader trend in place for five years, exchanges\u2019 stocks of BTC are drifting ever lower.\n\nAccording to the latest data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the combined holdings of the major exchanges totaled 2.332 million BTC as of Nov. 26.\n\nWith the exception of recent lows in October, this is the smallest amount of available BTC since April 2018. At its peak in March 2020, just after the COVID-19 cross-market crash, the tally stood at 3.321 million BTC.\n\nBitcoin exchange balance chart.

That's a 3.5% 24-hour rise. Over seven days, it's up nearly 3%.\n\nBitcoin last week blew past $38,000 per coin for the first time in 18 months. Before then, the cryptocurrency had generally traded below the $38,000 level ever since crypto mega project Terra collapsed in May 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, a combination of optimism surrounding the approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and comments today from Federal Reserve governor Christopher J. Waller are leading to bullish price action.\n\nOn Tuesday, Waller said that while \"inflation is still too high,\" he was \"increasingly confident that policy is currently well positioned to slow the economy and get inflation back to 2 percent.\"\n\nThis is having a positive impact on Bitcoin as investors feel more confident to put their money into an asset which has typically struggled\u2014along with other \"risk assets\"\u2014with high interest rates.\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at the European digital asset manager CoinShares, told Decrypt that \"it appears that Waller's remarks have favorably influenced Bitcoin prices,\" adding that it indicate \"a shift from the possibility of rate hikes, which were under consideration just two months ago.\"\n\nBitcoin and the crypto market was hit hard after Terra collapsed last May.

Most cash entering the space is focused on the biggest and oldest virtual coin and is coming from institutional investors, a CoinShares report yesterday showed.\n\nSuch investors are confident that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will finally approve a Bitcoin ETF after a decade of waiting. Such a product would give traditional investors exposure to crypto and, according to some experts, lead to a flood of capital into the space."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin held on Monday to most of the gains made over Thanksgiving week, with continued anticipation regarding the coin\u2019s upcoming halving event and optimism surrounding the still-unconfirmed approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF keeping the cryptocurrency hovering near highs not seen in well over a year.\n\nThe world\u2019s top cryptocurrency currently sits at $36,940 according to data from CoinGecko. That\u2019s a slight 3.27% drop from Friday, when Bitcoin smashed through $38,000 for the first time since the crypto market\u2019s collapse in May 2022.\n\nAll in all, BTC appears to be generally accumulating\u2014and retaining\u2014value in anticipation of multiple events likely slated for the new year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn April, the cryptocurrency is set to undergo its latest \u201chalving\u201d, which will reduce the amount of BTC available to be claimed through Bitcoin mining by 50%. Given the likely proportional drop in new BTC flooding the market that the occasion is set to trigger, many anticipate the event will deflate BTC market supply, and therefore increase the coin\u2019s price.\n\nHalvings will continue until no new BTC is produced, and the coin reaches a final supply of 21 million tokens. There are currently about 19.5 million BTC in circulation.\n\nIn the last week, other indicators have pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s network health improving in the run up to April\u2019s halving. The network\u2019s hash rate hit 491 exahashes per second last week\u2014an impressive computer power usage statistic that speaks to Bitcoin\u2019s current high level of mining activity, and, correspondingly, safety.\n\nThis increased hash rate is likely due to miners using new, more efficient machines purchased in anticipation of April\u2019s halving, Bitcoin analyst Henrike Christin M\u00fcller previously told Decrypt.\n\nFurther pushing Bitcoin\u2019s encouraging price gains this last month have been persistent rumors that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might finally approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, which would allow traditional financial institutions and investors to gain exposure to BTC without owning any cryptocurrency. Blockchain analysts at CryptoQuant have previously said the product could lead to a $1 trillion boost for Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThough the SEC recently opted to punt decisions about several Bitcoin ETFs into the new year, there have been recent indicators that financial behemoth BlackRock might be on track to list the financial product in the near future.\n\nBut regardless of the actual likelihood of an imminent approval of a Bitcoin ETF, market enthusiasm about the prospect is at an all-time high\u2014and even the slightest indicators of good news on the subject have continued to shoot BTC higher in recent weeks.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCharlie Munger, longtime business partner of Warren Buffett and vice chairman of multinational holding company Berkshire Hathaway, has died at the age of 99, the company announced today. Munger's proclamations, much like Buffett's, were often eminently quotable takedowns of bad investments\u2014and few assets raised his ire like Bitcoin.\n\n\"I think it's rat poison,\" he famously said in 2013, when Bitcoin was worth $150. When asked to revisit his comments five years later, when the world's largest cryptocurrency was trading at $9,000, he said, \"So it's more expensive rat poison.\"\n\nWhen pressed on the returns some Bitcoin investors were able to make, he called them \"idiot booms\" that harm the U.S.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBerkshire Hathaway annual meetings were often called \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" and putting Munger and Buffett on stage was a top draw. Asking about cryptocurrency was a reliable way to get them to use colorful language.\n\n\"In my life, I try and avoid things that are stupid, and evil, and maybe look bad in comparison with somebody else,\" he said in 2018. \"Bitcoin does all three.\"\n\n\"It's stupid because it's very likely to go to zero; it's evil because it undermines the Federal Reserve system... and third, it makes us look foolish compared to the communist leader in China,\" he explained. \"[Xi Jinping] was smart enough to ban Bitcoin in China... we are a lot dumber.\"\n\nThree years later, and Munger was still fuming.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"I just think the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization,\" he said in early 2022, comparing crypto to a venereal disease, deeming it \"beneath contempt.\"\n\nEven at 99 years old, he mustered more fiery condemnation at the Daily Journal Corporation annual meeting earlier this year.\n\n\"Sometimes I call it crypto crapple and sometimes I call it, well, crypto shit,\" he said, going on to use the term half a dozen times during the course of the conversation. \"It's ridiculous that anybody would buy this stuff.\"\n\n\"It's asinine, it's not slightly stupid it's massively stupid, and it's very dangerous,\" he continued. \"The governments were totally wrong to permit it. I'm not proud of my country for allowing this crypto shit, it's worthless, it's no good, it's crazy, it'll do nothing but harm.\"\n\nWhile Munger's attacks ruffled cryptocurrency backers, his candor was long part of Berkshire's folksy public image. He worked alongside Buffett for decades, offering investment wisdom almost as quotable as the \"Oracle of Omaha\" himself.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway said Munger died peacefully in a California hospital. Buffett paid tribute to Munger's \"inspiration, wisdom and participation\" in building Berkshire into the conglomerate it is today."

The move prompted some analysts to note that the regulator appeared to be moving quickly.\n\nThe SEC said it wants more analysis and is \"instituting proceedings\" to do so. The regulator asked commenters on Tuesday about concerns regarding manipulation and fraud, as well as the fund's relationship to Coinbase, which would be the custodian if the ETF garners approval.\n\n\"The Commission is providing notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration,\" it wrote, saying it wanted to analyze whether the application is consistent with the requirement that \"the rules of a national securities exchange be 'designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices' and 'to protect investors and the public interest,'\" the agency said in the filing.\n\n\"Institution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. Rather, as described below, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons to provide comments on the proposed rule change,\" it continued.\n\nThe asset manager first filed for the Franklin Bitcoin BTC -3.26% ETF in September, and, if approved, would have shares listed and traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Multiple applications for spot bitcoin ETFs have been filed from other asset managers including BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nHashdex application\n\nThe regulator also said it would institute proceedings and solicit public feedback on an application for the Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF application, which proposed converting its exchange-traded fund listed on the New York Stock Exchange into a partial spot product.\n\nComments on both funds are due in 21 days, with a rebuttal period continuing for two weeks after that.

SEC went super early on Franklin. They weren't due for another decision until Jan 1,\" James Seyffart, an ETF Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote on X. \"Going super early on Franklin today (and potentially @hashdex coming too?) would set things up for a full wave of approvals in early January. Might be the reasoning?\"\n\nVan Buren Capital's Scott Johnsson said the move could be an effort to get all the spot bitcoin ETFs on the same timeline.\n\n\"They might have chosen to do this early so they could have the comment period end before Jan 10, in order to approve everyone at the same time,\" Johnsson posted on X.\n\nFresh Franklin Templeton filing\n\nFranklin Templeton followed the SEC action on Tuesday by filing an amended S-1 form.\n\n\"Notably, the language in this S-1 mimics a lot of others on the creation/redemption process.

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin will hit $100,000 by next year, British multinational bank Standard Chartered has said.\n\nThe bank made its first bullish predictions back in April, predicting that the largest digital coin would hit $100,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nIn July, its team of analysts projected that Bitcoin could hit $120,000 in the same timeframe.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the protracted bear market that dominated 2023 is only recently showing signs of thawing, the bank is again saying Bitcoin could hit $100,000\u2014and that a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be the catalyst.\n\n\u201cWe now expect more price upside to materialize before the halving than we previously did, specifically via the earlier-than-expected introduction of U.S. spot ETFs,\u201d a report by the bank said. \u201cThis suggests a risk that the $100,000 level could be reached before end-2024.\u201d\n\nThe \u201chalving\u201d the bank is referring to is an event where the amount of Bitcoin awarded to miners\u2014those who process transactions and mint new coins\u2014is cut in half.\n\nStandard Charter did not respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nIt\u2019s viewed as a bullish indicator for the asset because it reduces the supply of Bitcoin that miners are able to unload onto the market, in turn pushing up the demand\u2014and price\u2014for the existing coins in circulation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStandard Chartered previously said this would lead to an increase in price of the biggest digital asset.\n\nBut in its latest report, the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF could lead to quicker appreciation to a higher price. A number of major Wall Street investment firms\u2014including BlackRock\u2014have applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for their own Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSuch a product would allow traditional investors to get exposure to Bitcoin without worrying about storing or buying the cryptocurrency on an exchange.\n\nAnd if lots of institutional interest floods the space, the price of the asset will go up, according to some analysts.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Charles Hoskinson says, There was no Cardano ICO; argues Bitcoin is not decentralized - FXStreet",
        "content": "Charles Hoskinson criticized the SEC for giving Bitcoin a \u201cfree pass\u201d while other crypto assets are treated as securities.\n\nThe Cardano founder noted that BTC is not decentralized, as it would take merely three subpoenas to perform a 51% attack on the network.\n\nUpon being highlighted that the ADA\u2019s ICO is the reason Cardano is treated as a security, Hoskinson stated that it did not have an ICO.\n\nCardano is known as the third-generation cryptocurrency and, at times, even the \"Ethereum killer\" but never as \u201cnot a security\u201d. For that matter, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to date, has only named Bitcoin as \"not a security,\" and XRP partially won that label following its lawsuit win. This seemingly did not sit well with Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson.\n\nCharles Hoskinson criticizes the SEC\n\nCardano founder Charles Hoskinson, during a recent stream, took on the SEC for giving Bitcoin essentially a free pass by not scrutinizing it as security the same way it does with other crypto assets. Hoskinson stated,\n\n\"Explain it to me [the difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies] like I am a five years old. Run the Howey test.\n\nHe went on to add that Bitcoin is not as decentralized as the SEC believes it to be. The reason is that over 51% of the hash rate can be controlled merely by subpoenaing the top three hash pools.\n\nIn response, crypto influencer Adam Black stated that the reason behind Bitcoin not being secure is that it did not do an ICO (Initial Coin Offering). He added,\n\n\"Bitcoin did not do an ICO, most people thought it had no value, it was mined from zero, it is decentralised, there is no CEO, ICO warchested \"foundation\", incorporation etc. so cardano, eth etc clearly pas howey, Bitcoin is a commodity and does not.\n\nICOs are a form of crowdfunding where cryptocurrencies are sold to investors in the form of tokens. The ICO boom of 2018 was one of the biggest driving factors of the bull run noted back then.\n\nHoskinson replied to Adam's statement by saying that Cardano did not do an ICO. He noted,\n\n\"There was an airdrop onto a distribution, and then thousands of people who never met each other traded Ada on exchanges and used Cardano for their projects. A voucher sale of a different asset outside of the United States, priced in Yen, settled in Bitcoin, explained in Japanese to Japanese citizens, and without a single US participant does not constitute an ICO of Ada.\n\nTechnically, Cardano did conduct an ICO by utilizing a novel variation. As stated on Cardano's official website discussing the genesis of the chain, the ADA vouchers were sold by a Japanese corporation and its sales force in Japan with total gross sales of 108,844.5 BTC. The public sales distribution accounts for 25,927,070,538 ADA, of which 2.4 billion were distributed to IOHK, the developer of Cardano.\n\nThus, as long as the United States does not establish clear guidelines and regulations for the crypto industry, Charles Hoskinson and others will continue to criticize the SEC for its seemingly partial approach toward crypto assets."

        "title": "Better Bitcoin Stock: Coinbase Global vs. Marathon Digital - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) and Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) represent two very different ways to invest in the Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) market. Coinbase is one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, and it facilitates trades of Bitcoin, Ether (CRYPTO: ETH), Tether (CRYPTO: USDT), and other crypto assets. Marathon is a Bitcoin miner that mines its own Bitcoin with a massive fleet of high-end application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners.\n\nBoth stocks more than tripled this year as Bitcoin's price more than doubled. That rally was driven by stabilizing interest rates, potential approvals for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) pinned to Bitcoin's spot price, and its growing popularity as a safe haven asset. But should you invest in either of these Bitcoin-driven stocks right now?\n\nCoinbase still has a lot to prove\n\nCoinbase's stock might have outperformed Bitcoin's price this year, but it's still underperformed Bitcoin over the past two years. Coinbase generated weaker long-term gains than Bitcoin for three simple reasons.\n\nFirst, Coinbase only generated 38% of its trading volume from Bitcoin trades in its latest quarter. Another 19% came from Ether, 15% from the Tether stablecoin, and the remaining 28% from other crypto assets -- including smaller tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other speculative assets that flopped as interest rates rose. Its exposure to those slower-growth assets seems to be throttling its overall growth.\n\nSecond, its trading volume and revenue fell sequentially over the past two quarters, even as Bitcoin and Ether recovered. That slower trading activity suggests it's struggling to retain its users and assets. However, we can't be sure because it stopped disclosing its monthly transacting users (MTUs) and total assets on its platform this year. Lastly, the bulls are staying away as government regulators tighten their grip on Coinbase and its crypto peers.\n\nAnalysts expect Coinbase's revenue to dip 11% in 2023, compared to its 57% decline in 2022 and 545% growth in 2021. That grim outlook suggests the crypto winter is far from over.\n\nOn the bright side, its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) turned positive over the past three quarters as it reined in its spending, and its $5.5 billion in liquidity should give it plenty of time to stabilize its business and profit from the crypto market's eventual recovery.\n\nMarathon's mining business is still growing\n\nMarathon was once a tiny patent holding company. But in 2020, it abandoned that business model, rebranded itself as a Bitcoin miner, and ordered tens of thousands of ASIC miners to capitalize on the market's growing interest in Bitcoin.\n\nThe critics initially balked at that abrupt transformation, but Marathon is now the world's largest pure-play Bitcoin miner, with 157,160 deployed miners and a hash rate capacity of 23.1 EH/s (exahashes per second). For reference, its closest competitor, Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT), had deployed 106,674 miners with a hash rate capacity of 11.7 EH/s by the end of October. Marathon has mined 9,812 Bitcoin year to date, while Riot has only mined 4,996 Bitcoin.\n\nMarathon's revenue surged from $4 million in 2020 to $159 million in 2021, then declined 26% in 2022 as Bitcoin's price dropped. But in 2023, analysts expect its revenue to nearly triple to $347 million as Bitcoin's price rises, it opens two new plants, and it launches a new joint venture in Abu Dhabi. They also expect it to turn profitable by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and adjusted EBITDA measures.\n\nMarathon carries some of its mined Bitcoin on its balance sheet, but it also regularly liquidates some of those holdings to boost its own cash flows. It ended the third quarter of 2023 with $101 million in cash and $287 million in Bitcoin on its balance sheet -- representing the first time its total cash and Bitcoin position exceeded its total debt.\n\nThe better buy: Marathon Digital\n\nCoinbase's business might eventually stabilize, but it still isn't a bargain at 29 times next year's adjusted EBITDA. Marathon trades at just 18 times next year's adjusted EBITDA -- seemingly cheap relative to its near-term growth potential. Marathon also faces fewer regulatory threats than Coinbase, provides more exposure to Bitcoin, and is still expanding its mining operations. It's still a speculative stock, but I believe it could easily outperform Coinbase if Bitcoin continues to rally.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Coinbase Global\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe major crypto tokens were trading in the red on Monday, dragged by the losses in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap declined 1.26% to around $1.42 trillion in the last 24 hours.At 9.45 a.m., BTC was trading 1.05% lower at $37,321, while the second most popular token, Ethereum, was down 1.26% at $2,047.Other popular altcoins, such as Solana and Polygon, plunged 2.6% and 2.8%, respectively. Also, BNB XRP , Cardano, Tron, and Litecoin fell 1-2%.With steady resistance to cross the $38k mark, BTC held steady above $37k over the weekend. Investors feel that BTC\u2019s price action is beginning to show downside correction. If BTC fails to rise beyond $38k, it could see start a fresh decline for itself, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch VenturesHowever, if we don\u2019t look at BTC in isolation, many investors believe that it showcases upside potential for the crypto market, especially after Blackrock\u2019s BTC ETF (iShares Bitcoin Trust) presentation to the SEC representatives, Parth added.Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, said, \"Bitcoin breached the $38,000 threshold over the weekend. However, the bulls could not sustain this movement and the price consolidated around the $37,300 level. To keep the bullish momentum alive, Bitcoin will now need to clear the resistance around $37,700 or risk finding support around $37,100.\"The total volume in DeFi is currently $4.65 billion, 10.81% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $39.06 billion, which is 90.76% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, fell to $729 billion.

BTC volume in the last 24 hours surged 71.4% to $14.82 billion.\"BTC has been consolidating for over three weeks within a broad range of $35,000 to $38,000. In the current week, BTC attempted to surpass the significant resistance at $38,000 but failed. A successful break and sustained hold above $38,000 would be considered a bullish sign. Conversely, breaking down the major incline trendline support at around $36,500 could lead to a decline in prices,\" said CoinDCX Research Team(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
