        "title": "Bitcoin had a big drop late last week. Here's what sparked it, and why that volatility can persist - CNBC",
        "content": "Bitcoin's back to its volatile ways after its big move down late last week \u2014 but not for the reason investors expected. Volatility has been a defining characteristic of bitcoin in both positive and negative ways, but it's been almost completely absent from the market for several weeks. That was, until Thursday night, when the cryptocurrency suddenly tumbled as much as 9% . Aside from the mismanaged crypto lenders (and FTX) that plagued the crypto market in 2022, the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting rate hiking campaign played a big part in bitcoin's downward price pressure. Though investors had started to think the Fed was done with rate hikes for the rest of this year, the minutes of the latest FOMC meeting released Wednesday showed central bank sees \"upside risks\" to inflation that could lead to more increases. That's when bitcoin's decline really began, and the volatility could linger, according to Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian investment fund manager 3iQ. \"The volatility will have a persistence if we're going to stay here at an elevated real rate environment,\" he told CNBC. \"We're not surprised when we see a stepwise function in yields, 25 basis points in a month to 4.25% on the 10-year \u2013 the highest in the long time. Mortgage rates are higher, the next hanging chads to drop is credit risk defaults.\" BTC.CM= 5D mountain Bitcoin (BTC) began falling after the July FOMC meeting minutes were released Wednesday. Market observers typically monitor where the benchmark fed funds rate is hovering, but \"real rates\" account for the difference between nominal rates and inflation indicators. Even if the Fed doesn't raise interest rates anymore, the crypto space seems more focused now on real rates and keeping them elevated to fight inflation. \"These are just normal developments that happen when we're stepping into a new rate regime,\" he said. \"This isn't like bad behavior from last year. The centralized, unregistered, unregulated bad actors and fraudsters hiding offshore entities \u2013 that was last year.\" A 'healthy bloodletting' Investors expected volatility would return when regulatory headwinds turned into tailwinds \u2014 by seeing an SEC-approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund or clear crypto legislation enacted in Congress. That would also usher in the return of liquidity, which left the market after the banking crisis in the spring, and help create a better functioning market. \"This is a healthy bloodletting of some of the active trade management and a reminder that we don't have liquidity and of why we need regulation,\" Connors said. \"We need to have more active engaged market makers in this space to absorb and provide liquidity with guidance from developed markets like the U.S.\" Crypto needs regulatory clarity so institutional buyers can own crypto assets, Connors explained, likening the situation to high-yield debt in the 1980s: It's still a core holding even though it had its own notorious bad actors that've gone away. \"The market and institutions own it. It's a stable market because you have long bias market,\" he said. \"If we get clarity \u2026 and we get the ability of institutions to just buy \u2026 then when you get these downdrafts of 10% or 15%, institutions won't rebalance their 1% to 2% holdings in bitcoin against equities, they'll add more.\" \"When Bitcoin goes up \u2026 there'll be selling into people buying it. That's a healthy ecosystem,\" he added. Having institutions with an established long core holding would act as a stabilizing force for Bitcoin, Connors added. But currently, institutions are one the sidelines until they get clarity from regulators on how they can bring crypto into their business. That's why this summer's bitcoin ETF filings from BlackRock, Fidelity and other institutions are so critical. \"Until this gets settled, capital can't go into the space to help provide that shock absorption,\" Connors said. \u2014CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed reporting."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether stable after last week's nosedive; XRP leads crypto gains; US stock futures mixed - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin edged up on Monday morning in Asia to trade slightly above the US$26,000 support level, after sliding over 10% for the week. Ether also moved higher but remained below US$1,700 following last week\u2019s losses. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. XRP led the winners, despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moving to challenge a June court ruling in favor of Ripple Labs. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped as NFT marketplace OpenSea said it will stop enforcing creator royalties from August 31. U.S. stock futures traded flat after Wall Street logged weekly losses at close of trading Friday.\n\nBaby steps upward for cryptos after painful few days\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.28% in the last 24 hours to US$26,178.36 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, logging a weekly loss of 10.68%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency hit a two-month low of US$25,409.11 on Friday, but held position above the US$26,000 support level over the weekend.\n\nA cool-off of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hype in the U.S. could be behind the retreat of the token. That\u2019s the view of James Butterfill, head of research at European alternative asset manager CoinShares.\n\n\u201cThe surge in June, spurred by BlackRock\u2019s application for SEC approval of a Bitcoin ETF, led to a noticeable spike in prices,\u201d said Butterfill in a report released Friday.\n\n\u201cHowever, markets are now coming to terms with the realization that an immediate SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is unlikely. It\u2019s noteworthy that current Bitcoin prices have stabilized around levels observed before this announcement,\u201d he added.\n\nThe low volume and volatility in Bitcoin, a rise in U.S. treasury yields, as well as concerns over China\u2019s ailing economy contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s sharp weekly decline, the CoinShares report found.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for the markets in the forthcoming months presents a blend of opportunities and challenges. It\u2019s anticipated that the U.S. Federal Reserve will refrain from hiking rates further in September,\u201d Butterfill said.\n\nStory continues\n\nA dovish shift in Fed policy could provide a boost to Bitcoin\u2019s prospects, he added.\n\n\u201cOn the flip side, investors are eagerly awaiting the SEC\u2019s verdict on the Grayscale ETF and BlackRock applications in September. Anticipations are that decisions on both applications might be postponed, potentially leading to investor disappointment,\u201d Butterfly said.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether moved up 0.85% to US$1,683.57 but remained 8.50% lower for the past seven days.\n\nThe U.S. SEC could approve several ETFs based on Ethereum futures by October 2023, Bloomberg reported on Friday citing unnamed sources. Investment firms Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill and ProShares have all applied for Ethereum ETF licenses.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours, but all posted weekly losses. Cryptocurrencies have seen a total liquidation of US$24.91 million in the past 24 hours.\n\nThat\u2019s a considerable decrease on the daily losses posted last week during a calamitous downturn in the crypto market. On Friday alone, traders liquidated over US$1 billion in cryptocurrencies, including US$851.94 million in long positions \u2014 positions where investors bet the cryptocurrency price will rise. On Monday, long position liquidations stood at US$6.89 million for the past 24 hours, according to data from crypto information platform CoinGlass.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the winners, gaining 3.96% to US$0.5408 but plunged 13.76% for the week.\n\nIn the on-going legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC, Judge Analisa Torres on Thursday granted the SEC permission to appeal an earlier judgement in favor of Ripple Labs. That ruling in late June found that the technology firm\u2019s programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities laws.\n\nIn a Saturday tweet, Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz said the SEC should not be allowed to appeal until the conclusion of the case. He said that, even if an appeal is granted, \u201cthe case should still continue and the appeal should run in parallel.\u201d\n\nYes. A party that loses on any claim or issue in their suit is entitled to appeal any adverse rulings at the conclusion of the suit. The SEC is asking for permission to appeal here because the suit is not complete yet for any party.\n\n\n\nYou can see why there would be a rule like\u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) August 18, 2023\n\nRipple will have until September 1 to respond to the SEC\u2019s appeal motion.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.45% in the past 24 hours to US$1.06 trillion, while trading volume fell 13.09% to US$21.67 billion.\n\nOpenSea NFT marketplace to stop enforcing creator royalties\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.08% in the past 24 hours to 2,327.91 as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, and fell 5.94% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum Polygon and Cardano NFT indexes also logged losses, while the index for Solana moved higher.\n\n\u201cThe catalyst for this (NFT index drop) was OpenSea\u2019s decision to get rid of royalties,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, in a YouTube video uploaded Sunday.\n\nOpenSea, one of the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplaces, announced on Thursday it would stop enforcing creator royalty fees, making them optional. The change will take effect from August 31. The platform will continue to charge a 2.5% fee for every transaction.\n\n\u201c(The mandatory royalty fee on OpenSea) was meant to empower creators with greater control over their Web3 business models, but it required the buy-in of everyone in the Web3 ecosystem, and unfortunately that has not happened,\u201d wrote OpenSea in the announcement.\n\nOpenSea\u2019s move received criticism from commentators. In a tweet Friday, Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and an investor in OpenSea, described the decision as a \u201chuge mistake\u201d that would hurt the industry.\n\nNot collecting and paying royalties on NFT sales is a HUGE mistake by @opensea. It diminished trust in the platform and hurts the industry. And I say this as an @opensea investor @DevinFinzer \u2014 Mark Cuban (@mcuban) August 18, 2023\n\nYuga Labs, the creator of NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), responded to the news in a tweet Saturday saying it will gradually wind down its support for OpenSea. \u201cYuga believes in protecting creator royalties so creators are properly compensated for their work,\u201d the company said.\n\nOn @opensea's decision to sunset their Operator Filter. pic.twitter.com/ahc155WWkX \u2014 Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) August 18, 2023\n\n\u201cWhat I think will happen is they either reverse their decision, or Yuga Labs may end up launching their own NFT marketplace,\u201d said Forkast Labs\u2019 Petscher on Sunday. While the impact of the decision is only just being felt, he added, it will \u201cchange the landscape of NFTs.\u201d\n\nTotal NFT trading volume gained 15.60% in the past 24 hours to US$14.76 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana and Polygon blockchains all logged increases, while Cardano\u2019s volume dipped.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based BAYC saw the largest 24-hour sales volume, which rose 45.30% to US$2.02 million. Mythos Chain-based DMarket and Polygon-based DraftKings ranked as the second and third largest collections by 24-hour trading volume.\n\nIn terms of single NFT sales, BAYC #8585 sold at over US$255,000 on Sunday, making it the most expensive NFT traded in the past 24 hours. However, its former holder purchased the NFT at over US$1 million in October 2022.\n\n\u201cThis seller took a huge loss on this NFT,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cThat explains the rising average sale price but also the declining profits.\u201d\n\nChina policy stimulus lacks punch\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, after the three major U.S. indexes closed mixed on Friday and booked losses for the week.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes traded mixed on Friday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng logged losses, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved up.\n\nIn the U.S., investors await Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. The Fed\u2019s annual summit is attended by central bank leaders from across the world. Powell\u2019s speech could provide insights into the Fed\u2019s thinking on monetary policy.\n\n\u201cWe view the event as a good opportunity for Powell to start laying the ground for the next step in the Fed\u2019s policy guidance: no longer focused on how many hikes to expect, but rather on rates remaining \u2018higher for longer,'\u201d analysts at Canadian investment bank TD Securities said in a note viewed by Reuters.\n\nIn July, the Fed raised the interest rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% \u2014 the highest level since January 2001. Powell said in a statement following the decision that the U.S. central bank will \u201ctake a data-dependent approach\u201d in determining its future monetary policies. It did not indicate if there are more hikes in the cards or how long the Fed would keep up its tightening cycle.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 11.5% chance for another 25-basis-point increase.\n\nU.S. data to watch in the week ahead includes U.S. chipmaker Nvidia\u2019s second-quarter earnings report, as well as S&P Global\u2019s purchasing manager indexes (PMI). Both are set for release Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the country\u2019s central bank cut its one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.45% from 3.55% on Monday morning. However, it kept the five-year LPR unchanged at 4.2%, according to the state media Xinhua News Agency.\n\nThe stimulus measure was smaller than the analyst expectation of two 15-basis-point cuts to both the one-year and five-year rates. Commentators said China\u2019s central bank may need to act more decisively to soothe growing fears of a recession.\n\n\u201cUntil more forceful policy responses are made available to backstop the contagion risk, we believe Chinese stocks will settle in a lower trading range than we previously envisaged,\u201d Goldman equity strategists wrote in a note viewed by Bloomberg.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "World domination was not on the menu at this year\u2019s Summit at Sea, an invite-only cruise that convenes a \u201cglobal community of entrepreneurs, academics, athletes, artists, astronauts,\u201d and beyond.\n\nRelative to its past self, the vibe at the once ambitious floating Davos for millennial technocrats was muted against a backdrop of broader anxiety gripping Silicon \u00adValley as it navigates uncertain waters. Even for a gathering long interested in wellness, there was a telling number of powdered elixirs in Summit\u2019s swag bags, as well as an awful lot of seminars focusing on mental health, spirituality, and psychedelics\u2014and in Palo Alto demand for hallucinogenic mushrooms, ketamine, and LSD is running high, as the likes of Sergey Brin and Elon Musk evangelize about their healing qualities.\n\n\u201cPeople are not feeling as bullish,\u201d says one regular, who described attendees as seeking a break from reality, not a platform to \u201caccelerate their supercharged rocket startup.\u201d Supercharging is less important right now than stress management through breath work.\n\nBeyond the comforts of Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Voyages Scarlet Lady, where Summit took place en route to the Bahamas, high and rising interest rates have battered the sector\u2019s stocks and wiped out multiple lenders, such as Silicon Valley Bank. Venture funds are raising a fraction of what they previously raked in, so the startups they bankroll have gone from being awash in cash to having to hunt for it.\n\nAnadolu Agency // Getty Images FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried leaves from Manhattan Federal Court after court appearance in New York, United States on June 15, 2023.\n\nThe hardest hit sector back on land has been crypto. Bitcoin has plummeted from its 2021 peak, largely devastating its flash-in-the-pan billionaire class. Over the course of the past year: The exchange FTX went bankrupt, and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, and colleagues were charged with orchestrating one of the biggest financial frauds ever. Do Kwon, whose currency Luna once commanded a fan base of self-\u00addescribed \u201cLunatics\u201d before its failure contributed to the industry\u2019s $2 trillion face-plant in 2022, was charged with fraud by federal prosecutors and arrested in Monte\u00adnegro. The Securities and Exchange Commission slapped two of the biggest remaining crypto companies, Binance and Coinbase, with a slew of charges. And the market for NFTs has become a ghost town of lawsuits, expensive regrets, and few true believers.\n\n\u201cThe mania has died down,\u201d says Molly White, a fellow at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab and creator of the site Web3 Is Going Just Great, a Bonfire of the Vanities\u2013style chronicle of the tech industry\u2019s excesses and pitfalls. \u201cPeople don\u2019t tell me, \u2018Have fun staying poor\u2019 as much as they used to.\u201d\n\nCrypto\u2019s early adopters were never quite so gauche. Even new money has old money, and those who bought Bitcoin when prices were so low it was basically Monopoly bills are discreetly hunkering down to weather the slump without attracting the attention of skeptics like White or SEC chairman Gary Gensler, the Inspector Javert of crypto regulation. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, founders of the exchange Gemini, are more likely these days to Instagram a pizza party than an NFT of their moon-bound astronaut avatars, as in 2021.\n\nJoe Raedle // Getty Images Bitcoin bros Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss in 2021 at a crypto conference in Miami.\n\nBack then all bets were off. More tech startups were valued north of $1 billion in 2021 than in the prior five years put together. But this year venture funds in the U.S. have had a harder time raising money than they have in a decade, according to \u00adPitchBook-NVCA. So far in 2023 such funds have gathered less than $30 billion, putting them on track to raise less than $55 billion for the year\u2014compared with $168 billion last year. The future was virtual then, and profits were infinite. One Bitcoin was worth $65,000. A JPEG collage of smaller JPEGs sold for $69 million at Christie\u2019s. The voice-only app Clubhouse was valued at $4 billion and NFT marketplace OpenSea at $13.3 billion. Facebook rebranded as Meta and breathlessly described our \u00adavatar-rich, legless future. Everyone was always in Aspen, or joining a crypto colony in Puerto Rico; everyone quit their jobs and got better ones, for so much more money. As a financial journalist, I saw the worst minds of my generation rolling in far too much disposable income. It was so, so goofy. It was not fun staying poor.\n\nJulia Love, a crypto consultant, won a McLaren at a conference in Miami and wrapped it in cartoon shiba inus, the symbol of the Bitcoin offshoot Dogecoin. \u201cI thought it would just be, like, ha-ha,\u201d she says. \u201cI did not do it for attention.\u201d In much the same way that Saul Steinberg\u2019s 50th birthday party marked the end of the go-go \u201980s, with its let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, and Stephen A. Schwarzman\u2019s 60th top-ticked an overheated 2007, Love\u2019s stunt epitomized the frenzy of the moment.\n\nThen the price of Bitcoin plummeted, at one point falling below $16,000. Crypto\u2019s rabid era seems in retrospect to have been a harbinger of high inflation, which the Federal Reserve has since been working to cool by hiking interest rates. \u201cThere\u2019s always this group of what I would call startup groupie people, who start something at whatever the hype is,\u201d says Tarun Chitra, founder of the crypto cybersecurity company Gauntlet. \u201cYou can tell a bubble is forming if you start meeting those people.\u201d\n\nWin McNamee // Getty Images Securities and Exchange Commission Chairmain Gary Gensler, the Inspector Javert of crypto regulation.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a saying you hear whenever the market is down: Time to build. Within the crypto industry the mood is refusing to go quietly. Some are hanging on to their coins because it feels better than selling and accepting the loss; a slim chance of a rebound is better than no chance. Others have staked too much of their reputation and time on it. And others are partying like it\u2019s 1999 and the dot-com bubble hasn\u2019t yet burst. Just look at the way the conference circuit is oontz-oontz-oontzing still: the Medici conference in Los Angeles, the Bitcoin confab in Miami, ETHDenver, Consensus in Austin, and Chain\u00adalysis\u2019s Links Amsterdam. And then there was Summit at Sea. Before the ship weighed anchor in May, for the first time since 2016, there was talk of trouble selling all the tickets, which started around $5,000. Once it was at sea, though, the scene raged like a euphoric post-pandemic reunion\u2014or a deliriously fun game of musical deck chairs aboard the Titanic of tech.\n\n\u201cThis cruise has everything,\u201d executive coach Naveen Ghushe posted on Instagram, referencing Saturday Night Live\u2019s Stefon. \u201cImpact investors who have never had jobs. Psychedelic shamans who are addicted to Elf Bars. And life coaches who don\u2019t have a life.\u201d\n\nIt helped that Bitcoin was beginning to recover\u2014prices hovered close to $30,000 in July\u2014and tech enthusiasts saw a bright spot on the horizon, something on its way to becoming a silver bullet for the entrepreneurial class, a deus ex machina that would solve all its problems: artificial intelligence. \u201cThere\u2019s a stream of crypto influencers who have rebranded as AI influencers,\u201d says White.\n\nUncertainty lingers, though. Over the summer the Biden administration was considering restrictions on the export of AI chips, which walloped shares of Wall Street\u2019s favorite new stock, the semiconductor company Nvidia. And Sam Altman, whose OpenAI is under FTC investigation, has testified before Congress about the risks of the technology\u2014for the planet. Such a murky outlook requires breathing through it. At least there is some good news: Days after returning to shore, Summit announced it will again set sail in 2024.\n\nThis story appears in the September 2023 issue of Town & Country under the headline Silicon Valley at Sea.

        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\nJudge grants SEC request to file motion for appeal in Ripple case\n\nJudge Analisa Torres has granted a request from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to file a motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal in its case against Ripple Labs. The decision allowed the SEC to file a motion, on Aug. 18, requesting permission to bring a case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Ripple will also be able to file an opposition to the motion. Torres ruled, on July 13, that Ripple\u2019s XRP token is not a security when distributed in public sales, but the ruling considered XRP a security in institutional sales. The case against Ripple has been ongoing since December 2020, when the SEC sued Ripple and its executives over allegations of offering an unregistered security.\n\nBitcoin, Ether price slump leads to crypto bloodbath with $1B in liquidations\n\nThe Bitcoin and Ether price slide on Aug. 18 saw the top two cryptocurrencies fall to a two-month low and triggered a series of liquidations for thousands of derivative traders. The crypto bloodbath led to billions of dollars worth of hedged positions being liquidated, and several traders lost millions of dollars in a single trade. According to CoinGlass data, a total of 176,752 traders got liquidated within hours, indicating a rapid rise in price volatility just days after BTC and ETH recorded their lowest daily volatility in several years. The price function in the crypto market was attributed to several factors, including the SpaceX Bitcoin write-down and macroeconomic factors.\n\nBitcoin-friendly El Salvador sees bond returns soar to 70% in 2023\n\nEl Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2021, has seen its dollar bond outperform the majority of the emerging markets with a 70% return in 2023. The massive rally of the bond has now drawn interest from several institutional giants, including JP Morgan, Eaton Vance and PGIM Fixed Income, prompting President Nayib Bukele to say, \u201cI told you so.\u201d Apart from the institutional giants, the likes of Lord Abbett & Co LLC, Neuberger Berman Group LLC and UBS Group AG have also added debt security since April. El Salvador paid $800 million in debt in full within the due maturing time at the start of this year, raising confidence in the country\u2019s bonds again.\n\nFirst EU spot Bitcoin ETF hits Euronext Amsterdam exchange\n\nEurope welcomed its first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF after the long-awaited launch of Jacobi Asset Management\u2019s Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF. The London-based digital asset management firm announced that its new investment product was going live on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange on Aug. 15, more than a year later than its planned launch in 2022. The new ETF is trading under the BCOIN ticker. Its launch marks a milestone for Europe, while United States regulators are yet to approve a number of similar spot Bitcoin ETF applications from major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity. The new ETF is trading under the BCOIN ticker.\n\nCoinbase wins NFA approval to offer Bitcoin and Ether futures in US\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has obtained approval from the National Futures Association (NFA) to offer investments in crypto futures to eligible customers in the United States. The approval enables Coinbase to introduce Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts through a derivatives exchange regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

In the latest incident, crypto lender SwirlLend has apparently carried out a rug pull. PeckShield reported that SwirlLend transferred tokens from Base and Linea, bridging the crypto to Ethereum. It then created a new token and laundered 253.2 ETH through the Tornado Cash crypto mixer. SwirlLend has shut down its social media accounts and website. Its total value locked on Base has fallen from $784,300 to $49,200. Crypto trade surveillance firm Solidus Labs also found more than 500 scam tokens on Base.\n\nFBI seizes almost $2M of crypto assets in 3 months\n\nA public filing released by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) shows that the law enforcement agency seized around $1.7 million worth of digital assets from March to May.

        "content": "Hong Kong introduced new regulations for exchanges in June, following years of uncertainty about crypto.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped the creation of a vibrant crypto culture.\n\nThe metropolis teems with crypto storefronts offering over-the-counter trading in Bitcoin, Ether, and altcoins.\n\nSome days it seems like everyone in Hong Kong has a crypto story.\n\nThe son of the security guard in my apartment block bought three restaurants with money made from Bitcoin investments. I tell a Romanian importer at a bar that I write about crypto and he pulls up the leg of his jeans to reveal a Bitcoin tattoo on his calf. A medical student at Hong Kong University tells me her friends made \u201cso much money\u201d trading tokens \u2014 but she knows little about crypto herself.\n\nSigns of Bitcoin and its ilk are, quite literally, everywhere in this metropolis of 7 million. An environmental group advertises its NFT collection on a billboard by the Star Ferry terminal where you cross to Hong Kong Island from Kowloon.\n\nCrypto crazed\n\nThe crypto scene in Hong Kong these days is striking, given the existential levels of angst now rippling through the industry.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nIt\u2019s true, Bitcoin is up more than 60% this year and ETH has jumped 40%, but with US regulators clamping down on the likes of Coinbase and Binance, and DeFi regularly roiled by hacks and heists there\u2019s an unmissable vibe that the revolution is in trouble. So why is Hong Kong so crypto crazed?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum ATMs still abound in Hong Kong. Photocredit: Shutterstock\n\nHard to say, but the evidence is ample. Walking through Central, the city\u2019s business district, on a Saturday night, there\u2019s a sign by the mid-level escalators for Bitcino, \u201cwhere Bitcoin meets casino and drinks.\u201d\n\nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s ApeFest is coming to Hong Kong later this year. Convenience stores stock an NFT magazine created by local enthusiasts. The app I use to top up my phone credit shills the metaverse at me.\n\nNOW READ: Why Lebanon just can\u2019t quit Justin Sun\u2019s Tron \u2014 it\u2019s \u2018100% mixed up\u2019 with Tether\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn contrast to other cities, where it isn\u2019t easy to find crypto-related things, in Hong Kong they\u2019re hard to avoid. You might find the occasional cafe in Singapore with an Azuki on the wall or countries like Thailand that give you NFTs when you visit certain tourist spots, but Hong Kong is next level.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that not too long ago there was a perception that crypto was dead in Hong Kong.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that not too long ago there was a perception that crypto was dead in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2021, Henri Arslanian, former chair of the FinTech Association of Hong Kong, told The Financial Times that every large crypto company in the city had \u201calready started a contingency plan to relocate their business due to the uncertainty.\u201d He moved his firm, Nine Blocks Capital, to Dubai last year.\n\nThen the Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission announced plans to regulate exchanges. In June, the city launched a task force for promoting web3. Politicians including Johnny Ng are staking their reputations on this being the future in the city.\n\nCreative mashups of Bitcoin and other forms of recreation are plentiful in Hong Kong. Photocredit: Callan Quinn/ DL News\n\nWhy Hong Kong changed its mind about crypto is still not clear. Some put it down to improved understanding among regulators. Some say the government got a case of FOMO as Singapore and Dubai started trying to coax away their companies.\n\nStill others say it\u2019s the guiding hand of Beijing \u2014 though, given China\u2019s hard line on crypto, this raises more questions than it answers. Beijing, after all, has banned speculating on tokens and mining Bitcoin.\n\nBut perhaps the strangest thing you may notice in Hong Kong is how many over-the-counter crypto shops there are.\n\n\u2018Call Me Bitcoin Queen\u2019\n\nForeign exchange outlets on Nathan Road now sit side by side with booths bearing names like Crypto King. The T symbol for Tether hangs at the entrance to Chungking Mansions, a notorious 60-year-old tower block that houses an eclectic collection of hostels, rent-by-the-hour rooms, phone repair shops, currency traders, fake watch sellers, doss houses, and cheap curry kitchens. Now it\u2019s added crypto to its list of amenities.\n\nThe forex and remittance shops are still more popular than their crypto counterparts \u2014 one shopkeeper rolls his eyes when I ask about his crypto neighbour \u2014 but occasionally a person saunters over to one of the crypto desks.\n\nWant some USDT and fast food? Bored Garden sells both. Photo credit: Callan Quinn/ DL News\n\nThe crypto shops are far more audacious than their forex counterparts. The crypto shop Coiner ran an ad campaign in 2021 featuring photos of the founder, Priscilla Ng, and the caption \u201cCall Me Bitcoin Queen\u201d (perhaps an unfortunate choice of title given the \u201cCryptoqueen\u201d moniker often attached to OneCoin fraudster Ruja Ignatova).\n\nLaunched three years ago, Coiner has three branches in Hong Kong, one of which also doubles as an art gallery for NFTs. It\u2019s not even the biggest player in terms of branches. Another competitor, One Satoshi, has nine.\n\nBitcoin orange\n\nMeanwhile, Bored Garden is probably one of the only businesses in the world that sells both Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoins and hamburgers. The Bored Ape Yacht Club-themed restaurant in Central doubles as an over-the-counter shop. Like Coiner, it has a fondness for using Bitcoin orange.\n\nWhen it comes to crypto in Hong Kong, it\u2019s hard to pin down your typical user and their motivations, a staff member at one shop tells me. But they can offer some insights. Tether is more popular than Bitcoin and Ether. Customers aren\u2019t necessarily tech savvy \u2014 several shops have run educational programs in the past to teach people about crypto.\n\nNOW READ: Hong Kong regulators say crypto firms lie about submitting licence applications\n\nAnd a lot of customers come from mainland China, particularly since the border opened earlier this year.\n\nHong Kong has long been the first port of call for Chinese citizens wishing to get their money out of China. In theory, you can only move out $50,000 per person, per year. This has led to some convoluted schemes for moving money involving gold, jewellery and even strapping wads of cash to your body to pass through customs.\n\nCoiner is one of many OTC shops that are doing business in Hong Kong's revived crypto scene. Photocredit: Coiner\n\nTen years ago, I used to hear stories about taking money through the border by buying necklaces in Shenzhen and then trading them for cash at a sister shop in Hong Kong. It might have been an urban legend, but it demonstrates the desire a lot of people have to get their funds out of the country. Despite the ban in China, crypto remains a popular way to do so.\n\nThis popularity with mainland visitors may become an issue for storefront crypto businesses. Some now refuse to take mainland customers, citing the crypto ban in China. Scrutiny of crypto is ramping up: From January to April, more than 675 crypto scams were reported to police, involving some HK$416.6 million ($53.2 million).\n\nRegulatory changes\n\nAs exchanges face regulatory changes that will allow them to operate compliantly in the city while servicing retail customers, little has been said about OTC trading. Yet facilitating the purchase of cryptocurrency for mainland citizens is unlikely to be allowed to continue long-term.\n\nFor now, the crypto party is back in full swing.\n\nAt the Central Market, I get to chatting with someone who runs an NFT fashion company. A devotee of Hedera Hashgraph, a crypto network, chews my ear off for 30 minutes about how it\u2019s a superior technology to traditional blockchain.\n\nInvariably, people ask me what token they should invest in next. I reply that I don\u2019t have a clue.\n\nCallan Quinn, DL News\u2019 Hong Kong correspondent, covers the crypto industry in Asia. Have a tip? Contact the author at callan@dlnews.com."

        "title": "Bitcoin nosedive jolts crypto market out of its summer stupor - The Economic Times",
        "content": "Bloomberg\n\nGlobal Concerns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin has had a sleepy summer. This week, it was shaken awake. For the past several months, the hallmark volatility that previously attracted hordes of investors to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has been absent, with the rate of its swings reaching its lowest point since 2016.That lull snapped Thursday, when Bitcoin plunged more than 8% in the space of a few hours to a two-month low of $25,314 late in the New York day. The slump sparked a broad decline across all of crypto, leading to more than $1 billion in liquidations and putting Bitcoin on pace for its worst week since November and crypto exchange FTX\u2019s collapse.The carnage \u2014 fueled by the prospect of prolonged high interest rates and exacerbated by thin crypto trading \u2014 was a reminder of the various threats that continue to stalk digital assets, from hostile regulators to a broader rout in risk assets. And even as Bitcoin has recovered smartly from last year\u2019s lows, many investors are still sitting out, depriving the market of the breadth and depth that are key ingredients for a sustained bull run.\u201cThere are still significant amounts of macro uncertainty keeping investors away, and liquidity is still thin,\u201d said Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto Is Macro Now\u201d newsletter and former head of market insights at Genesis Trading. \u201cBottom line, there\u2019s not yet enough conviction.\u201dThursday\u2019s activity marked another entry in an emerging trendline for Bitcoin in 2023, with the token having already crashed to two similar low points in January and March. But every sharp decline this year has been followed by recovery, said FRNT Financial\u2019s Stephane Oullette.\u201cThe next few days should give more clues to whether the selloff will continue and we\u2019ll see a reversal of this year\u2019s trend,\u201d Oullette said in an email on Friday. Signs that Bitcoin is making a major divergence would be if the token were to make a decisive break below the $25,000 mark, he added, or conversely, a sustained push beyond $30,000. Its high for the year was $31,818 in July.Part of the reason behind this week\u2019s plunge was the market\u2019s outsize exposure to larger trades. The last four months have had the lowest average daily volume of spot crypto transactions since October 2020, according to Riyad Carey, a research analyst for blockchain data firm Kaiko. At that time, Bitcoin was worth around $10,000, while the second most popular cryptoasset Ether, now at $1,670, was valued at $350.The sector is also overly reliant on narrative to prop up prices, with hype around crypto\u2019s next buzzy project or a Wall Street firm buying cryptocurrencies among the things that spur on investors. A Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX had sold Bitcoin holdings worsened Thursday\u2019s decline.But the narrative is unlikely to improve when these days, many of the biggest announcements to rock the world of digital assets come either from regulators in Washington or judges in the courtroom. The hangover from 2022\u2019s run of bankruptcies and fraud scandals continue to play out on the world stage, dampening optimism on crypto\u2019s recovery.Just this week, former FTX co-founder and alleged fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried was escorted to a Brooklyn penitentiary after his bail deal was revoked by a judge. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to the multiple criminal charges he faces.Recent price declines can be partly attributed to US enforcement actions against crypto exchanges, CoinShares\u2019s James Butterfill said in a blog post on Friday, adding that a recent survey saw fund managers rank regulatory decisions as their key concern. The lingering threat of further lawsuits or penalties haunts the market, leaving investors wary of the safety of some of crypto\u2019s top venues.Despite this, Bitcoin has displayed a general resilience over the last few months when compared to global risk assets. Post crash, it\u2019s still up 58.1% so far in 2023 \u2014 far higher than the S&P 500\u2019s 13.6% gain. And while Bitcoin is likely to experience further downside if monetary conditions continue to deteriorate, Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Jamie Douglas Coutts reckons that hype around a potential US spot crypto ETF may help it maintain that value.BlackRock Inc.\u2019s surprise filing in mid-June for a Bitcoin ETF prompted a flurry of firms to follow suit and led to a mini-rally as investors bet that approval of the funds would spur a wave of fresh buying. And it\u2019s not just Bitcoin. A Bloomberg report late Thursday that the US Securities and Exchange Commission is poised to allow the first ETF based on Ether futures helped to reverse some of the token\u2019s initial plunge \u2014 and a confirmed approval will likely cause an Ether bounce that drives up other tokens with it, Acheson said.Still, absent a catalyst like an ETF approval, the market is likely to drift. And unfortunately for traders who thrive on price swings, Friday\u2019s sharp spike in price activity across Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is likely to be short-lived, at least until liquidity improves among both digital assets and more traditional markets.As central banks continue to raise or maintain high interest rates, the appeal of traditional financial investments like short-dated US Treasuries and other bonds have drawn focus away from crypto bets as investors chase a risk-off attitude.\u201cGlobal macro is going to continue to weigh in,\u201d said Fadi Aboualfa, head of research at crypto custodian Copper Technologies Ltd.Some crypto bulls say the sector could benefit from situations such as China\u2019s deteriorating property sector, which has become a primary concern from a macro perspective. Stimulus measures implemented by the government have so far failed to provide enough economic relief, and Bitcoin\u2019s positioning as an alternative financial system has some believing it might benefit from any shocks. \u201cWhile we consider a full financial meltdown unlikely, should it transpire, it might bolster Bitcoin, especially if the repercussions permeate the broader financial sector,\u201d said Butterfill.Ultimately though, what\u2019s bad for the global economy is likely also bad for crypto.\u201cIf the stock market drops accelerate, crypto is also likely to suffer in sympathy as investors choose to lock in profits with whatever they can and sit in high-yielding cash until the dust settles,\u201d said Acheson. \u201cThe dust will settle, however, most likely sooner in the crypto market than in the stock market as investors recalibrate the relative risk of each asset group.\u201d"

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThe prices of leading cryptocurrencies took another downturn this week after briefly inching upwards the week before.\n\nMarket leader Bitcoin (BTC) posted a mild overnight drop of 2% to below $29,000 on Thursday, after minutes of the latest Federal Reserve policy meeting were released the day before. The document indicatesthat the U.S. central bank will continue its conservative monetary policy in an ongoing effort to rein in inflation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLater that day, Bitcoin dropped below $28,000 for the first time in two months. By the afternoon, it appeared to be in the midst of a flash crash, reaching a bottom of $25,649 before rebounding a little.\n\nAnalysts told Decrypt that market liquidity has been in decline for a while now, leaving the entire market vulnerable to a sudden big sell-off.\n\nAnd a huge sell-off is just what occurred. News that Chinese property giant Evergrande filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in a Manhattan court prompted institutional investors and big holders to dump riskier assets, like stocks and Bitcoin, causing the sudden drop.\n\nAll told, Bitcoin ends the week at $25,935, posting a seven-day drop of 11.9%.\n\nClosest contender Ethereum (ETH) fared similarly, with an intraweek drop of 10.2% to $1,662.\n\nBroadly speaking, these were some of the lightest price movements. Altcoins generally tumbled harder, with most other leading cryptocurrencies posting losses of between 10% and 20%, including BNB, XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Polygon (MATIC), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLosses of over 20% were felt by holders of Uniswap (UNI), Litecoin (LTC), and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which dropped over 23%.\n\nThe most resilient cryptocurrency in the top twenty by market cap was TRON (TRX), which only fell 4.8% and currently sells for $0.073810.\n\nIn the news\u2026\n\nThe regulatory uncertainty around crypto continued apace as the news cycle in the U.S. and beyond gave crypto hopefuls very little to chew on.\n\nOn Monday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u2013a leading U.S. bank regulator\u2013dedicated two out of ninety pages to crypto in its annual report. Insignificant as it may seem, this was a first for the FDIC, which used the slim space to point out that crypto may pose \u201cnovel and complex\u201d risks to the financial system.\n\nArgentinian Bitcoin fans enjoyed a different week than the rest of us. The world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency reached its Argentine all-time-high of 10.2 million Argentine Peso (ARS) on Wednesday, piggybacked by a surprise victory in the country's presidential primaries by hopeful Javier Milei, a professed libertarian known for his pro-Bitcoin stance."

        "content": "Popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin fell more than 8 percent in a matter of hours on Thursday, hitting a two-month low of $25,314. Bitcoin's fall put it on course for its worst week since November last year, while also triggering a collapse in the prices of all other cryptocurrencies and leading to more than $1 billion in liquidations.\n\nThe plunge in prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might have been fueled by the possibility of high-interest rates for a prolonged period and thin crypto trading, reported Bloomberg.\n\nFRNT Finacial's Stephane Oullette while speaking to Bloomberg noted that every decline in Bitcoin this year has been followed by a period of recovery. \u201cThe next few days should give more clues to whether the selloff will continue and we\u2019ll see a reversal of this year\u2019s trend,\" Oullette noted.\n\nHe added that the signs that Bitcoin is making a divergence from this year's trends if the cryptocurrency goes below the $25,000 mark. On the other hand, he added that if Bitcoin pushed past the $30,000 mark it could even go past this year's high of $31,818.\n\nWhy are the Bitcoin prices plunging?\n\nHead of research at Enigma Securities Joseph Edwards while speaking to Reuters attributed the fall in Bitcoin prices to low volatility and a lack of enthusiasm from retail investors.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking to Bloomberg, Riyad Carey, research assistant at blockchain data firm Kaiko, noted that this week's drop in cryptocurrency prices could be due to the market's exposure to larger trades, noting that the past four months have seen the lowest average daily volume of crypto transactions since 2020.\n\nReportedly, the cryptocurrency market is too reliant on narratives that can prop up the prices. A recent report by the Wall Street Journal noting that Elon Musk's SpaceX had sold its Bitcoin holdings after writing down the value by $373 million might have played a major part in worsening the crash on Thursday.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nMilestone Alert!

Last year, the company disclosed that it sold most of its bitcoin holdings after acquiring it in 2021.\n\nFollowing the WSJ report, which cited SpaceX financial documents, the price of bitcoin plunged about 8% to about $26,500, and has since further decline to about $26,200. The price of bitcoin is down 11% over the past week, trading at levels last seen in mid-June.\n\nThe jump in bond yields has also been weighing on risk assets overall, including crypto. On Thursday, the 10-year Treasury yield hit the highest level since 2007 amid indications the Federal Reserve remains hawkish on rates.\n\nPrior to the recent slide, bitcoin had been trading in a sideways range for months as investors held out hope for the potential SEC approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, with applications from big-name financial institutions like BlackRock.\n\nFundstrat's Tom Lee has argued that a potential bitcoin ETF approval could send the cryptocurrency to new highs above the $100,000 level.\n\nBut the SEC has yet to show any indication that an approval is imminent, and more recently has delayed action on several bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "content": "On the latest episode of Macro Markets, analyst Marcel Pechman explains the impacts of the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet, breaking down how the Fed inflated its assets by $5 trillion between December 2019 and April 2022. Pechman notes that the expansion period coincides with a 38% crash in the S&P 500 index. Moreover, the Federal Reserve balance sheet surpassed the $8.9 trillion mark right as the stock market index reached its 4,800-point all-time high.\n\nThe problem, according to Pechman, is that the U.S. Treasury Department has a huge deficit, as the government spends more than it gets from revenues and taxes. Consequently, it needs to start rolling some of the debt instead of letting it expire, so odds are it won\u2019t be able to continue reducing the balance sheet any longer \u2014 something that has been a huge contributor to lowering inflation.\n\nUltimately, inflation will feel the biggest impact once the Federal Reserve is forced to expand its balance sheet again, Pechman argues. He advises that those holding scarce assets such as Apple shares, land, gold and Bitcoin (BTC) should hang on tight and not be fooled by the momentary period of reduced inflation.\n\nIn the show\u2019s next segment, Pechman covers deflation in China, which economists believe is an issue. Domestic consumption is decreasing, and it seems investors expect a miracle from their central bank\u2019s expansion of the balance sheet.\n\nIn essence, Pechman argues there are many red flags coming from China. If you want to know whether Pechman believes this is a risk for international economies and what will happen to stock markets and Bitcoin, watch the latest episode of Macro Marke on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

        "content": "DappRadar has pointed to an \u201calarming plunge\u201d in Bitcoin Ordinals nonfungible token (NFT) user activity, with trading volumes tanking around a whopping 98% since May.\n\nIn an Aug. 17 report, DappRadar highlighted its data showing that the total Bitcoin Ordinals sales volume had decreased from peak levels of $452 million in May to roughly $3 million as of Aug. 14.\n\nIn line with that drop, the number of transactions also declined by around 97% to 20,571 within that same period.\n\nOrdinals trading volume and sales count. Source: DappRadar.\n\nDappRadar described it as a grim scenario for the Ordinals market, but it emphasized that more time is required to determine whether this is a \u201ctemporary setback\u201d or a \u201csystemic problem of Bitcoin-based NFTs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis steep decline in both sales volume and count within such a short period is alarming for Bitcoin Ordinals. The diminishing sales count underscores the waning enthusiasm or perhaps confidence in Bitcoin NFTs,\u201d the report states. It adds:\n\n\u201cWhile fluctuations in sales volume could be attributed to market dynamics, a consistent decline in transaction count may point toward broader issues. It suggests that fewer traders are engaging with Bitcoin Ordinals, which could raise concerns about its longevity and relevance in the NFT space.\u201d\n\nQ2 saw a significant decline in the #NFT market, both in terms of trading volume and active wallets.\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest victims was #Bitcoin Ordinals, with sales down 97% since May.\n\n\n\nIs this the end of Bitcoin NFTs?\n\n\n\nDappRadar exploreshttps://t.co/v0ouv9uwVJ \u2014 DappRadar (@DappRadar) August 17, 2023\n\nThe decline comes after a hype-filled second quarter for Bitcoin Ordinals, which saw trading volumes and user activity skyrocket compared to the first quarter of 2023.\n\nDappRadar suggested that a key issue around the sustainability of Ordinals is that the Bitcoin community has a divided outlook on whether NFTs should be on the network or not, which isn\u2019t an issue for Ethereum and other blockchains.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals team launches nonprofit to grow protocol development\n\n\u201cThere are voices within the community that view Bitcoin primarily as \u2018digital gold,\u2019 suggesting that its primary function should remain as a store of value.

        "content": "Trader sentiment has turned bearish following Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 11% slump this week. Although Bitcoin is taking support near $25,000, several analysts are factoring in another leg down toward the crucial $20,000 level.\n\nThe weakness is not limited to the cryptocurrency markets alone. United States equities markets also witnessed a losing week. The S&P 500 Index fell 2.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped about 2.6%, with both indexes recording a three-week losing streak. This suggests that traders are in a risk-off mode in the near term.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nThe fall in Bitcoin dragged several altcoins lower, indicating a broad-based sell-off. However, among the sea of red, there are a few altcoins that have stood out either by bouncing off strong support levels or by continuing their up-move.\n\nLet\u2019s study the charts of the top-five cryptocurrencies that may buck the negative trend and stay positive over the next few days.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been range-bound between $24,800 and $31,000 for the past several days. After failing to sustain above the resistance, the price has dipped near the support of the range.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe fall of the past few days has pulled the relative strength index (RSI) into the oversold territory, indicating that a recovery may be around the corner. If the price rises from the current level, it could reach the 20-day exponential moving average ($28,309). The bears are likely to sell the rallies to this level.\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USDT pair may again drop to the crucial support at $24,800. If this support gives way, the pair may start a descent to $20,000.\n\nOn the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA will indicate that the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above $31,000 to start a new up-move, but that looks a little far-fetched at the moment.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the oversold territory on the four-hour chart, indicating that bears are in command. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the pair may retest the support zone between $25,166 and $24,800.\n\nConversely, a break and close above the 20-day EMA could signal that the bears may be losing their grip. That could start a rally to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $27,200 and then to the 61.8% retracement level of $27,680.\n\nHedera price analysis\n\nHedera (HBAR) turned down from the overhead resistance at $0.078 on Aug. 15, indicating that bears are active at higher levels. However, a minor advantage in favor of the bulls is that the buyers purchased the dip to the 50-day SMA ($0.054).\n\nHBAR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating that the buyers have the upper hand. The bulls will again try to push the HBAR/USDT pair to the overhead resistance at $0.078. If this obstacle is surmounted, the pair may surge to $0.093 and, eventually, to $0.099.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears continue to sell on rallies. The pair could then retest the support at the uptrend line. A break below this level may open the gates for a decline to $0.045 and then $0.040.\n\nHBAR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe recovery is facing resistance near the overhead resistance at $0.070. This suggests that the bears have not given up and they continue to sell on rallies. The price has turned down to the moving averages, which is an important level to keep an eye on.\n\nIf the price turns up from the current level, it will suggest that the bulls are trying to flip the moving averages into support. Buyers will then make one more attempt to overcome the barrier at $0.070. If they do that, the rally may reach $0.075.\n\nIf the price plunges below the moving averages, the pair may collapse to the uptrend line, which is an important level for the bulls to defend.\n\nOptimism price analysis\n\nOptimism (OP) broke below the moving averages but found support at the uptrend line. This suggests demand at lower levels.\n\nOP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has bounced off the uptrend line but is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA ($1.51). If the price does not break below the uptrend line, it will increase the likelihood of a rally above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the OP/USDT pair may rise to the overhead resistance at $1.88.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and plummets below the uptrend line, it will suggest that bears have seized control. The pair may first fall to $1.21 and then to $1.09.\n\nOP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to stall the recovery at the 50-day SMA. If the price closes below the 20-day EMA, the next stop is likely to be the uptrend line. A break below this support could indicate the start of a deeper fall.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 50-day SMA, it will indicate the start of a relief rally to $1.61. If this level is crossed, the pair could reach $1.71.\n\nRelated: Ripple CTO clarifies on SEC appeal, highlights case complexity\n\nInjective price analysis\n\nInjective\u2019s (INJ) price action of the past few days has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, indicating that buyers have a slight edge.\n\nINJ/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears pulled the price below the uptrend line of the triangle on Aug. 17, but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels. The bulls pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($7.73) on Aug. 18 and have successfully held the level since then. This suggests that the bulls are trying to flip the 20-day EMA into support.\n\nA rise above the 50-day SMA ($8.16) could signal that the bulls are back in the driver\u2019s seat. That could clear the path for a potential rally to $10. This positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the uptrend line. The INJ/USDT pair may then slump to $5.40.\n\nINJ/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows a strong bounce off the uptrend line, indicating that the bulls are fiercely protecting this level. The recovery is likely to face selling at the overhead resistance at $8.33.\n\nIf the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance but rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that bulls continue to buy on dips. That will enhance the prospects of a break above $8.33. If this resistance is cleared, the pair may rise to $8.83 and then to $9.50.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 50-day SMA. That could sink the pair to the crucial level of the uptrend line. If this level cracks, the pair may tumble to $6.50.\n\nTHORChain price analysis\n\nWhile most altcoins are reeling under pressure, THORChain (RUNE) has been in an uptrend for the past few days.\n\nRUNE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe up-move is facing selling at the overhead resistance at $2, as seen from the long wick on the Aug. 19 candlestick. The sharp rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI into deeply overbought territory, indicating that a consolidation or a minor correction is possible.\n\nIf bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will increase the possibility of a break above $2. If that happens, the RUNE/USDT pair could start its march toward $2.30 and then $2.60.\n\nContrarily, if the price dips below $1.41, it will signal the start of a deeper correction to the 20-day EMA ($1.33).\n\nRUNE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages on the four-hour chart are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. If the price sustains above $1.80, the pair could retest the critical resistance at $2.\n\nContrarily, if the price skids below $1.80, a drop to the 20-day EMA is possible. A strong bounce off this level will indicate that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That will increase the chances of a rally to $2.\n\nIf the price breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will signal that traders are selling on rallies. That may sink the pair to the 50-day SMA and then to $1.38.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) fell around 12% on Thursday, causing the big crypto to trade under the $26,000 psychological level. The price of the most favorite crypto began the day on August 17 at $28,700 before tumbling to a low of $25,234 on Coinbase.\n\nAnalysts say that the latest crash was triggered by a number of factors including Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX reportedly offloading its Bitcoin, a Chinese property giant going, and fears of more interest rate hikes.\n\nWhile there appears to be no consensus as to why the markets suddenly dropped, the dip provides an opportunity for investors to buy Bitcoin at a discount.\n\nCould BTC Provide a Buying Opportunity at $24,400?\n\nData from Trading and CoinMarketCap shows that BTC is currently in hands of the bears as it hovers around $26,427. The pioneer cryptocurrency is down 7% on the day and 10% over the last seven days. More than $1 billion has been wiped off its market capitalization to $514 billion. The daily trading volume is up 110% to $34.5 billion, attesting to the increasing transaction activity as fear, doubt and uncertainty grips the market.\n\nThe crypto fear and greed index has dropped from yesterday\u2019s neutral value at 37 to the \u201cFear zone\u201d at 37. According to Alternative, the firm that analyzes \u201cemotions and sentiments\u201d around Bitcoin, fear can be a sign that investors are too worried about their investments and hence sell to minimize their losses.\n\nBitcoin Fear and Greed Index\n\nThe BTC/USD daily chart below shows that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is moving within the negative region. The price strength at 20 suggested that the bears were in full control of the Bitcoin price.\n\nAs such, the price could drop further from the current position with 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level providing support at $25,975. Other levels to watch on the downside are the $25,500 support zone, yesterday\u2019s swing low at $25,234 and the $25,000 psychological level.\n\nLosing these levels would see Bitcoin drop to revisit the $24,410 level, embraced by the 123.6% retracement level. This would represent a 7% drop from the current price.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\n\n\nOn the positive side, the RSI showed that Bitcoin is oversold, meaning that a recovery could be on the cards as seller exhaustion kicks in. If this happens, BTC may rise from the current level with the first line of resistance emerging from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $25,558.\n\nAdditional barriers are found at the $27,000 psychological level, the $23.6% retracement level and the 50-day SMA at $28,397. Bitcoin has to complete the full retracement to $28,700 and climb higher to confirm a sustained recovery.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin flash crash triggers $1.36 billion in crypto liquidations - The Straits Times",
        "content": "LONDON \u2013 Bitcoin has had a sleepy summer. Last week it was shaken awake.\n\nBitcoin plunged more than 8 per cent in the space of a few hours to a two-month low of US$25,314 on Thursday. The slump sparked a broad decline across all of crypto, leading to more than US$1 billion (S$1.36 billion) in liquidations and putting Bitcoin on pace for its worst week since November 2022 and crypto exchange FTX\u2019s collapse.\n\nThe carnage \u2013 fuelled by the prospect of prolonged high interest rates and exacerbated by thin crypto trading \u2013 was a reminder of the various threats that continue to stalk digital assets, from hostile regulators to a broader rout in risk assets. And even as Bitcoin has recovered smartly from 2022\u2019s lows, many investors are still sitting out, depriving the market of the breadth and depth that are key ingredients for a sustained bull run.\n\n\u201cThere are still significant amounts of macro uncertainty keeping investors away, and liquidity is still thin,\u201d said Ms Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter and former head of market insights at Genesis Trading. \u201cBottom line, there\u2019s not yet enough conviction.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s activity marked another entry in an emerging trendline for Bitcoin in 2023, with the token having already crashed to two similar low points in January and March. But every sharp decline in 2023 has been followed by recovery, said FRNT Financial\u2019s Stephane Oullette.\n\n\u201cThe next few days should give more clues to whether the sell-off will continue and we\u2019ll see a reversal of this year\u2019s trend,\u201d Mr Oullette said. Signs that Bitcoin is making a major divergence would be if the token were to make a decisive break below the US$25,000 mark, he added, or conversely, a sustained push beyond US$30,000. Its high for the year was US$31,818 in July.\n\nPart of the reason behind last week\u2019s plunge was the market\u2019s outsize exposure to larger trades. The last four months have had the lowest average daily volume of spot crypto transactions since October 2020, according to Mr Riyad Carey, a research analyst for blockchain data firm Kaiko.\n\nThe sector is also overly reliant on narrative to prop up prices, with hype around crypto\u2019s next buzzy project or a Wall Street firm buying cryptocurrencies among the things that spur on investors. A Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX had sold Bitcoin holdings worsened Thursday\u2019s decline.\n\nBut the narrative is unlikely to improve when these days, many of the biggest announcements to rock the world of digital assets come either from regulators in Washington or judges in the courtroom. The hangover from 2022\u2019s run of bankruptcies and fraud scandals continues to play out on the world stage, dampening optimism on crypto\u2019s recovery.\n\nJust this week, former FTX co-founder and alleged fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried was escorted to a Brooklyn penitentiary after his bail deal was revoked by a judge. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to the multiple criminal charges he faces.\n\nRecent price declines can be partly attributed to US enforcement actions against crypto exchanges, CoinShares\u2019 James Butterfill said in a blog post on Friday, adding that a recent survey saw fund managers rank regulatory decisions as their key concern. The lingering threat of further lawsuits or penalties haunts the market, leaving investors wary of the safety of some of crypto\u2019s top venues.\n\nDespite this, Bitcoin has displayed a general resilience over the last few months when compared with global risk assets. Post crash, it is still up 58.1 per cent so far in 2023 \u2013 far higher than the S&P 500\u2019s 13.6 per cent gain. And while Bitcoin is likely to experience further downside if monetary conditions continue to deteriorate, Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Jamie Douglas Coutts reckons that hype around a potential US spot crypto exchange-traded fund may help it maintain that value.\n\nSome crypto bulls say the sector could benefit from situations such as China\u2019s deteriorating property sector, which has become a primary concern from a macro perspective. Stimulus measures implemented by the government have so far failed to provide enough economic relief, and Bitcoin\u2019s positioning as an alternative financial system has some believing it might benefit from any shocks.\n\nUltimately though, what is bad for the global economy is likely also bad for crypto.\n\n\u201cIf the stock market drops accelerate, crypto is also likely to suffer in sympathy as investors choose to lock in profits with whatever they can and sit in high-yielding cash until the dust settles,\u201d said Ms Acheson. \u201cThe dust will settle, however, most likely sooner in the crypto market than in the stock market as investors recalibrate the relative risk of each asset group.\u201d BLOOMBERG"
