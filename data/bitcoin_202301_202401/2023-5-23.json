        "content": "If you buy cryptocurrency , are you just taking a punt on it performing well, or is it a genuine investment like buying shares and commodities?\n\nMany people have asked that question as Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have boomed in popularity over the past few years, which has brought riches to some but financial catastrophe to others.\n\nI\u2019ve previously written about my experience of buying and selling Bitcoin as being more akin to gambling than investing.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Sign up\n\nIs Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies just gambling?\n\nA prominent group of politicians in the UK have now called for buying crypto to be treated as gambling when considering regulation of the sector.\n\nIn their view, crypto is such a high risk sector that it is more akin to gambling than investing, while they say the currencies themselves have no underlying value and their price is purely based on what the market is prepared to pay for them.\n\nThe Treasury Committee, a group of UK MPs who hold the financial services sector to account, said in a report last week that crypto has \u201cno intrinsic value and serves no useful social purpose and these characteristics more closely resemble gambling than a financial service.\u201d\n\nOur friends at MoneyWeek in the UK also reported the committee saying: \u201cThe events of 2022 have highlighted the risks posed to consumers by the crypto asset industry, large parts of which remain a wild west.\u201d\n\nA look at the fortunes of Bitcoin shows wild swings over the years, which have created millionaires but have also led some to lose everything.\n\nOver the past five years, the price of a Bitcoin has swung from about $3,500 to $65,000, and as I write this, it currently sits at about $27,000.\n\nA closer look at the charts shows in a short time, prices have plunged dramatically at times. For example, in May 2021 the price plunged from close to $60,000 to just under $35,000 in just three weeks. Of course, prices have risen at a similar speed too.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as UK MPs have said, there is little substance to crypto other than the price others are prepared to pay for it.\n\nWhen you buy shares in a company, you could argue that ultimately the same principle applies, but you at least have a myriad of factors that influence demand for that stock that are based on tangible components such as its recent performance, quality of its management team and its strategic aims.\n\nWhen you buy a commodity such as gold or art, you often physically hold that item and it may bring you or a future buyer pleasure such as in the quality of the art.\n\nMany people do not understand crypto\n\nThen there is the fact that crypto is such a mystery to so many people, which leans into my point that it is difficult to conduct the due diligence you need to do when investing. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s much harder to find a financial adviser who specializes in crypto as it is with standard investments.\n\nI got a lot of stick from crypto experts when I wrote my article on my experiences with Bitcoin , with some saying I didn\u2019t understand what I had bought and that it is indeed a long-term investment and not a gamble.\n\nThey\u2019re correct that I didn\u2019t understand all the ins and outs of exactly what goes into a Bitcoin like I would a standard investment or other areas of personal finance as I have not researched it to the level I have analyzed other personal finance topics. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I know what crypto is and how it works, but as you peel back more of the details, l I will come unstuck versus someone who works for a crypto firm.\n\nYet the fact I have some gaps in my knowledge, with the experience I have in personal finance, makes me question if anyone who doesn\u2019t devote a huge amount of time to the subject will fully understand crypto to the level required to pump lots of money into it, as it is complex.\n\nSo should you buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies?\n\nIn simple terms, if you know the crypto markets inside out and consider yourself an expert, then, of course, you are in a good position to decide for yourselves when and what to buy and sell.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know the markets inside out, there is nothing wrong with investing\u2026 ahem, gambling\u2026 with crypto as long as you know the risks and can afford to lose whatever you put in.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting people shy away from crypto, more that I hope my words can help them understand what exactly they are getting themselves into. Hopefully it is a venture that makes them a lot of money, but none of us have a crystal ball to know if that will be the case."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency prices moved higher on Tuesday after Hong Kong's securities regulator announced it will allow retail trading of certain crypto assets starting June 1.\n\nBitcoin rose 1.7% to $27,293.64, according to Coin Metrics. The largest cryptocurrency has been trading in a small range throughout May, struggling to break above $30,000 but staying above $25,000. Ether advanced nearly 2% to $1,851.91.\n\nLate Monday night, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission said it would allow retail investors to trade certain crypto assets beginning next month on registered trading platforms. The move was widely expected, with the announcement marking the end of a request for public comment it put out in February on its proposed regulatory requirements around retail trading in crypto.\n\nThe new guidelines are part of a broader effort of Hong Kong's to become a global crypto hub. That ambition is in sharp contrast with China, which banned crypto trading in 2021, as well as the U.S. where the regulatory stance toward crypto has turned hostile since the collapse of FTX.\n\n\"This news doesn't mean that a flood of retail buying power will enter the market at the beginning of June. \u2026 We could see some volume uptick in June, however,\" said Noelle Acheson, economist and author of the \"Crypto is Macro Now\" newsletter.\n\nHong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission has already licensed two digital asset platforms, OSL and Hash Blockchain, and it's likely some are already actively trading offshore, Acheson said."

        "title": "Crypto, the Fed and the debt ceiling: Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are falling today - USA TODAY",
        "content": "Bram Berkowitz\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nWhat happened with cryptocurrencies today?\n\nSeveral of the largest cryptocurrencies fell today in what appeared to be a move driven by macro fears, uncertainty about the debt ceiling, and ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve's May meeting minutes today.\n\nSince late afternoon yesterday, the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) traded 3% lower as of 11:45 a.m. ET today. Meanwhile, the price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) traded 3.2% lower, while the price of Litecoin (CRYPTO: LTC) was down 5.3%.\n\nSo what\n\nPart of what's been dogging cryptocurrencies today is the constant tug-of-war investors are having about their view on the Fed and interest rates and whether on not the Fed will pause its rate-hiking campaign at its next meeting. Currently, roughly 72% of investors are betting on a pause but that's a smaller percentage than it had been recently.\n\nFast-rising interest rates over the last year have crushed the likes of crypto and Bitcoin because they make riskier assets less appealing. Crypto has rallied this year largely on the belief that the Fed is preparing to end its rate-hiking campaign.\n\nWill they raise them again?Powell says Fed interest rates may not need to rise as much amid banking stress\n\nInflation has slowed a good amount this year but is still far away from the Fed's 2% target and the job market still looks extremely strong, which has investors questioning whether or not the Fed has seen enough data to end its rate-hiking campaign.\n\n\"Most developed markets are grappling with a shared problem. Core inflation is proving more stubborn than expected and remains well above central banks' 2 per cent targets,\" BlackRock analysts wrote in a recent research note. \"We think that means central banks can't undo any of their inflation-fighting rate hikes any time soon, even if financial markets think the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates before the end of the year.\"\n\nOn top of all of this, U.S. lawmakers still haven't reached an agreement to raise the debt ceiling, and the June 1 deadline when the U.S. could potentially default on its debt is rapidly approaching. Treasury yields have risen as a result of the uncertainty, which usually leads investors to take a risk-off approach.\n\nNow what\n\nCryptocurrencies have been rising all year on the belief that a Fed pause is near, but now investors are less sure that a pause and the rate cuts the market had been pricing in will actually materialize.\n\nAt 2 p.m. ET today, the Fed will release the minutes from its meeting earlier this month, which could shed light on whether or not the Fed will pause rates at its June meeting. The fact that we still don't have an agreement to raise the debt ceiling is concerning, but I'm hopeful lawmakers will eventually come to their senses. Cryptocurrencies tend to do well when the traditional financial system struggles, but if the U.S. defaults on its debt it's hard to know exactly what would happen.\n\nWhat happens if the US defaults?What you need to know as the debt ceiling deadline nears.\n\nI continue to believe Bitcoin and Ethereum are here to stay long term and like them as long-term investments. I own a little bit of Litecoin and there's talk that the altcoin may benefit from its upcoming halving event, but I really prefer Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBram Berkowitz has positions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

He also said he believes the negotiating teams could make progress Wednesday.\n\n\"Markets opened quite down after being down significantly yesterday, so this could be a reaction to that,\" said David Wells, CEO at Enclave Markets. \"Even though crypto is a global market, volumes pick up quite a bit during U.S. trading hours, so sometimes big crypto moves are following big equities moves that are macro driven.\"\n\nAs investors monitor the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations in Washington and Fed officials divided on where to go with interest rate hikes, bitcoin has started behaving like a risk asset again, just as it was starting to trade more in tandem with gold earlier this year.\n\nBitcoin and ether are on pace for their worst month of 2023, down 10% and almost 6%, respectively.

        "content": "Bitcoin 2023 Miami: Ordinals and Politicians Bring The Heat to Marquee Bitcoin Conference\n\nIt's May in balmy Miami, and that means Bitcoin 2023 is in town (well and those NBA playoffs as well!). The world's largest Bitcoin conference hosted its 2023 edition at the Miami Beach Convention Center for a final time last week. After 3 years in Florida, it\u2019s moving to Nashville in 2024. The conference welcomed the Bitcoin faithful from May 18 to 20, in the latest bid to dispel the Bitcoin winter gloom for good.\n\nThe next presidential hopeful, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., , was among the notable speakers at the event this year. Best-selling author Michael Lewis of The Big Short, Moneyball and The Blind Side was also present. U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry and presidential candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Tulsi Gabbard also attended the event.\n\nBitcoin heavyweights in attendance included Michael Saylor, Adam Back, Samson Mow, Jack Mallers, Caitlin Long, Robert Breedlove, Dan Held, and recent convert David Marcus, who graced the Nakamoto and mining stages to dissect Bitcoin\u2019s biggest pain points and rally the masses.\n\nIndustry Day\n\nThursday's Industry Day was a rather muted affair this year. There was a noticeable decrease in turnout compared to 2022, not only in attendance but also in (mainstream) star power, when the likes of Serena Williams and Jordan Peterson shared their 2 satoshis worth at the Bitcoin event last year.\n\nIt served as an overdue autopsy, with various panelists dissecting last year's FTX meltdown, intense regulatory scrutiny in the US, as well as a renewed emphasis on the importance of self-custodying your Bitcoin holdings.\n\nSeveral engaging talks on the main Nakamoto stage covered all corners of crypto. From why we need Bitcoin in the face of CBDCs and AI, to regulators, Bitcoin NFTs, TradFi, greener mining and so on.\n\nOne notable session, \"Boom to Bust: Wall Street & FTX,\" featured Jan van Eck and Eric Donovan. They explored the relationship between the financial industry and the now-defunct exchange, and the lessons it holds for investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe panel \"Fed vs Financial System '' brought together Caitlin Long, Miles Paschine, Ram Ahluwalia, and Mark Connors. They analyzed the complex dynamics between the Federal Reserve and the financial system.\n\nOther discussions centered around eco-friendly advances in Bitcoin mining, the renewed interest in self-custody, and combating anti-crypto sentiment. Frank Holmes and Andy Long shared insights on mining during the \"Mining Stage\" panel. Matt Odell provided a comprehensive Bitcoin 101 session, emphasizing the importance of self-custody. Additionally, experts like David Zell, Perianne Boring and Mina Khattak discussed strategies for combating regulatory obstacles in the \"Fighting the Anti-Crypto Army\" panel.\n\nGeneral Attendance Day 1\n\nAfter a slow Industry Day on Thursday, Friday saw a sizable uptick in attendance. A solid turnout of visitors came to listen to and interact with hundreds of speakers, Bitcoin proponents, and projects during General Attendance Day 1.\n\nHighlights included pro-Bitcoin regulation talks by Democratic Party hopefuls, Arthur Hayes\u2019 interview with \u201cThe Big Short\u201d author Michael Lewis, the big Ordinals debate, Jack Mallers\u2019 Strike unveiling and more.\n\nSaylor On Ordinals\n\nBitcoin\u2019s biggest evangelist, Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, continues to accumulate Bitcoin over the long term with little regard for short-term fluctuations. He put in a long day in the service of the world's leading cryptocurrency.\n\nThe tech billionaire spent several exhausting hours in the media room at the tail end of the day, where he conducted many in-depth interviews and waxed lyrical about the role of Bitcoin in the face of inflation, authoritarian regimes, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Oh, and network congestion caused by BRC20 and Ordinals transactions.\n\nOn the latter, Saylor remained neutral, stating that he neither endorsed the likes of Ordinals nor wanted it censored.\n\nHe believes that the entire discussion of ordinal inscriptions is important to Bitcoin for two reasons.\n\n1) For Bitcoin to achieve long-term success, the Bitcoin miners must be successful.\n\n2) For companies, governments and individuals to adopt Bitcoin, it is necessary to develop applications on layer two and layer three.\n\nIf one were to discourage application developments, it would make it more difficult to scale and would also harm the Bitcoin mining network, where transaction revenue has to grow faster than the hash rate for the network to grow .\n\nElection 2024 Candidates Champion Bitcoin\u2019s Cause\n\nIn their talks, Kennedy and Gabbard highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s values and importance as a tool against governmental overreach. They explained that it will help to combat enhanced surveillance and financial control, facilitated by CBDCs and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThey criticized US regulators' hostile climate for crypto companies and investors, such as the 30% Bitcoin mining tax. Kennedy in particular laid out a strong manifesto in which he pledged to ensure Bitcoin stays the global hub of crypto. He aims to do this by defending the right to self-custody and run home nodes of Bitcoin, ensuring the neutrality of industry energy regulations, and even reviewing whether the likes of Ross Ulbricht should be pardoned if they\u2019re victims of an anti-crypto crackdown.\n\n\u201cWe broke Bitcoin\u201d: Bitcoin Ordinals Debate Takes Center Stage\n\nThe Big Bitcoin Ordinals Debate brought together experts to discuss the future of Bitcoin. It delved into the implications of ordinals, which have split the Bitcoin community into smaller factions. Those that embrace BRC20 see ordinals\u2019 extended use cases for BTC. But, others see them as an attack on the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency due to the network congestion and fee spikes they bring with them.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Magazine Youtube\n\nBitcoin purists and the new Ordinals and BRC20 rebel alliance clashed on the Nakamoto stage Friday afternoon.\n\nUdi Wertheimer and Eric Walls of Taproot Wizards, sporting cheap wizard outfits and beards, shared the stage with Spiral\u2019s Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin Core contributor, and masked independent writer Shinobi Monkey. Things got off to a predictable start with Shinobi getting called a \u201cBlockchain Karen\u201d by Wertheimer after saying ordinals were an attack on Bitcoin that originated out of the Bitcoin SV camp.\n\nDuring the often lighthearted and technical discussion, the expert panelists explored whether ordinals pose a threat to Bitcoin, and the need to distinguish between user behavior and the underlying protocol. The debate also touched upon different approaches to tokenization, such as counterparty tokens, and covered the efficiency of protocols and trade-offs involved, especially with BRC20.\n\nArthur Hayes Interviews Michael Lewis\n\nDuring a fireside chat, Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, interviewed Michael Lewis, the bestselling author known for books like \"Moneyball\" and \"The Big Short.\"\n\nLewis drew attention in the crypto community after spending time with Sam Bankman-Fried for research on his next book on the FTX collapse.\n\nLewis expressed he\u2019s intrigued by the crypto space and referred to it as \"Financial Kanye.\" He criticized the persistence of financial intermediaries in the banking system, noting that they have found ways to rig the system and take unnecessary rents. Lewis expressed hope for a financial revolution through DeFi. He also speculated on US regulators' slow response to bail out banks connected to crypto during the recent liquidity crisis.\n\nMallers\u2019 Strike Expands to 65 countries and Adds Lightning Features\n\nJack Mallers, CEO of Strike, announced that his Bitcoin payments company Strike has expanded to 65 countries. It would also be moving its global headquarters to El Salvador, as US crypto firms are getting out to friendlier regulatory pastures.\n\nThe expansion allows users to send and receive money instantly using the Lightning Network, catering to the requests of users. The update also introduces the ability to receive funds in U.S. dollar equivalents, including USDT, and a revamp of the app's user interface and logo.\n\nDuring his speech at Bitcoin 2023, Mallers emphasized the company's wider vision, aiming to provide a reliable service for Bitcoin adoption and a unique brand identity. Mallers highlighted the company's responsiveness to user feedback and expressed their commitment to being an exceptional global money app.\n\nSaturday: Day 2 General Attendance\n\nThe final day of Bitcoin Miami 2023 delivered several strong talks revolving around Bitcoin\u2019s current and future use cases. It also covered challenges in an ever-evolving broader technological, investing and regulatory landscape.\n\nNotable talks include The Art of Bitcoin Banking panel with Caitlin Long, Obi Nwosi (Fedi) and Casa\u2019s Jameson Loop, while Adamant Research\u2019s Tuur Demeester pondered if \u201cAI Dream of Electric Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWertheimer was on again in the Transaction Censorship panel with Nick Hansen (Luxor) and Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s Craig Deutsch. The discussion then shifted to global with Zoltan Pozcar (Credit Suisse)\u2019s talk on Geo Politics and Bitcoin. Following that, El Salvador government member Max Keiser explained the plot behind Super-HyperBitcoinization to Stacy Herbert of the Bitcoin Office.\n\nAfter lunch, Lyn Alden and Dylan LeClair spoke on Lightning for Businesses and Steady Lads.\n\nThe 2023 edition finally concluded with a short but good one: The Biggest Bulls. The old and new guard of Bitcoin, Adam Back of Blockstream and Strike\u2019s Jack Mallers espoused on the value of Bitcoin, with the organizer\u2019s Matt Odell moderating.\n\nAsked at what price he would sell his BTC, Mallers made it clear that only health-related expenses would separate him from his satoshis.\n\n\u201c... the only thing that I mentally compartmentalize to reference how to price this thing is how much I value my life.\"\n\nExhibition Hall Highlights\n\nOf course, Bitcoin Miami wouldn\u2019t be the same without some extravagance.\n\nBitcoin Bazaar\n\nThe Bitcoin Bazaar market provided plenty of Bitcoin in-jokes, cool stuff and not-so-subtle digs at the wider crypto space, with everything from Bitcoin panties, shitcoin toilet to Bitcoin children\u2019s books.\n\nAttendees could also ride a mechanical bull to win 1 BTC, play a cornhole competition or kick a soccer ball, or simply gawk at a Bitcoin DeLorean car straight out of Back to the Future.\n\nOrdinals Alley\n\nThe Ordinals Alley by Gamma provided strong visual energy to the event, with dozens of eye-catching art pieces adorning temporary walls and many sold for auction.\n\nThis scene seems likely to continue to explode in the coming year, and with the independent event Ordinals2023 running simultaneously in Miami this year.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBitcoin Week wrapped up in Miami on Bitcoin Pizza Day. It is the industry\u2019s Thanksgiving, with a couple of small events to celebrate Laszlo Hanyecz\u2019s 10,000 BTC sacrifice.\n\nLast year saw a staggering 35,000 visitors flock to the event on the back of the 2021 bull run. The conference, organized by BTC Inc. and Bitcoin Magazine's owners BTC Media, LLC, only drew an estimated 15,000 visitors this year. Factors such as the ongoing crypto winter, Bitcoin market doldrums, and steep ticket prices all drove down attendance.\n\nThe 3-day event remains a necessary staple on the crypto calendar. It serves as a platform for passionate discussions about the impact of Bitcoin. This includes its role in the battle for society in a technological and authoritarian landscape.\n\nOverall, the conference can be a bit heavy handed on the Bitcoin rhetoric if you\u2019re a bit more chain-agnostic. But, it still provides a feast of worthwhile ideas, innovation and discussions for everyone.\n\nWhile Bitcoin Miami 2023 may not herald Crypto Spring yet, it is setting itself up as a springboard to what is to be a much sunnier 2024. With the next Bitcoin halving locked in for late April next year, and the Ordinals and BRC20 movement growing, expect things to be very different this time around next year in Nashville."

        "content": "The monthly trading volume of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and memecoins on Bitcoin in May surpassed Solana\u2019s volume, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nBitcoin ordinals trading volume currently stands in second place behind Ethereum, which did $393 million in NFT volume, more than twice that of ordinals on Bitcoin (BTC) in 30-days starting April 23. Bitcoin gained a significant lead over popular blockchains like Polygon, ImmutableX, BNB Chain and Solana during this period.\n\nAccording to a Dune dashboard by BRC-20 token standard creator Domo, BRC-20 token transactions accounted for the majority of ordinals activity on Bitcoin.\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard is an experimental fungible token standard built using ordinals. It has harbored hype for memecoin, speculative cryptocurrencies whose price action is fueled by certain enthusiastic communities.\n\nThe total market capitalization of BRC-20 memecoins breached the $1 billion mark during the first half of May as the hype around it picked up. The current market capitalization of BRC-20 tokens is $447 million.\n\nPercentage share of Bitcoin transactions by activity. Source: Dune\n\nThe popular BRC-20 tokens like ORDI, PEPE and MEME have no utility attached to them and were primarily issued for experimental purposes. For instance, Twitter user Domo created ORDI to showcase the BRC-20 functionality that Ordinals provided.\n\nThe primary driver of BRC-20 volumes appears to be coming from traders who are looking to benefit from the newfound craze. However, as gains subside, the trading activity around BRC-20 tokens will likely fall as well.\n\nBitcoin NFT trading picks up\n\nBesides BRC-20 tokens, the market is witnessing a shift from BRC-20 tokens to media-based ordinals, aka Bitcoin NFTs. Magic Eden, a popular Bitcoin NFT marketplace, has started to eat into UniSat\u2019s volume, which primarily trades in BRC-20 tokens.\n\nPercentage share of volume by marketplace. Source: Dune\n\nPopular collections like Bitcoin Frogs did around one-fourth the volume of top collections on Ethereum like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), which did just over $40 million in trading volume between April 23 and May 23.\n\nNFT traders will hope to replicate the success of Ethereum NFTs on Bitcoin with collections forming exclusive groups of ordinals holders.\n\nSo far, the Bitcoin NFT ecosystem appears miles behind Ethereum, which can support decentralized autonomous organizations and has other advantages like integration with the $27.5 billion strong decentralized finance ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, BAYC and Azuki have metaverse projects built around them, which provide exclusive advantages to NFT holders. On the other hand, CryptoPunks and Milady Maker enjoy popularity due to their scarcity and early mover advantage.\n\nRelated: Milady NFT floor price surges after Elon Musk tweet\n\nIt remains to be seen how successful Bitcoin NFT collections are in forming loyal communities like that of CryptoPunks, Milady Maker, Azuki or BAYC. While the trading volume of NFTs and memecoins on Bitcoin attained the second spot in May, the NFT collections have yet to provide utility or build a loyal community of holders.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Can quantum computers mine Bitcoin faster? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Quantum computing, explained Quantum computing is an emerging technology that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Quantum mechanics is the foundation for quantum computing, allowing for the special qualities of superposition and entanglement that could make quantum computers more powerful than conventional computers. Quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in numerous states simultaneously, as opposed to classical computers, which use bits to represent information as either a 0 or a 1. As a result, they can carry out some computations far more quickly than traditional computers. Quantum computing may have a significant influence on cryptography. Today\u2019s encryption techniques frequently rely on the difficulties of factoring huge numbers or resolving other challenging mathematical puzzles for conventional computers. However, the speed at which quantum computers could solve these puzzles might make current encryption techniques attackable. Another area where quantum computing could have an impact is in Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining involves complex arithmetic problems that must be solved to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. However, mining Bitcoin (BTC) demands a lot of processing power, which is why specialist equipment and software are needed. Quantum computers might be able to handle these issues considerably more quickly than traditional computers, which might make mining BTC more efficient. Nonetheless, it is crucial to remember that quantum computers are not always superior to classical computers in all situations. For instance, certain operations that require sifting through a lot of data, like looking for a particular record in a database, are still better suited for classical computers. Additionally, the impact of quantum computing on cryptography and Bitcoin mining remains to be seen, with researchers still exploring the potential of this emerging technology.\n\nHow efficient are quantum computers in Bitcoin mining? Complex mathematical problems must be solved throughout the Bitcoin mining process, which can be accomplished significantly more quickly using quantum computers than with classical ones. Yet, it is currently unclear how quantum computing may affect Bitcoin mining. While quantum computers may increase mining productivity, they may also increase the risk of quantum hacking on the Bitcoin network. This is because many public key cryptography-based encryption techniques used to protect Bitcoin are susceptible to attack by quantum computers. Quantum hacking is a cyberattack that uses quantum computing to break through cryptographic systems. Public key cryptography is a mathematical algorithm allowing two parties to communicate securely without exchanging a secret key beforehand. The approach is based on the complexity of some mathematical tasks, such as computing discrete logarithms or factoring huge integers, which are thought to be challenging for traditional computers to tackle well. Researchers are investigating using quantum cryptography and quantum-resistant algorithms to address this issue. These techniques could help safeguard the Bitcoin network in the future since they are more resistant to attacks from quantum computers. Furthermore, there are currently no quantum computers that can mine Bitcoin more effectively than conventional computers. But, as quantum technology develops further, it is conceivable that quantum Bitcoin mining may become a reality in the future. Related: Cryptocurrency vs. quantum computing: A deep dive into the future of cryptocurrencies\n\nCan a quantum computer hack Bitcoin? By exploiting its higher processing capacity to defeat the encryption that safeguards private keys and transactions on the Bitcoin network, a quantum computer could theoretically hack Bitcoin. However, the current state of quantum technology is not yet advanced enough to pose a significant threat to Bitcoin\u2019s security. Quantum computers might make public-key cryptography less secure because of their capacity to answer some mathematical problems far more quickly than classical computers. For example, Shor\u2019s algorithm \u2014 a quantum algorithm \u2014 can factor large integers exponentially faster than classical algorithms. Factoring large integers is the basis of many public key encryption schemes, including the one used in Bitcoin. The public-key cryptography employed in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might hypothetically be cracked if a quantum computer had the processing capability to carry out Shor\u2019s algorithm. An attacker with a quantum computer could potentially steal BTC by computing the private key corresponding to a public key used to receive Bitcoin. The big prime numbers used to generate the public-private key combination could be factored in to achieve this. However, it is crucial to remember that quantum computing is still in its infancy and lacks the power to carry out Shor\u2019s algorithm at the scale necessary to decrypt Bitcoin. Although small-scale quantum computers have been shown to factor in small numbers, there is still a long way to go before a large-scale quantum computer that breaks Bitcoin\u2019s encryption can be built. In addition, the Bitcoin network is constantly developing to counter possible security risks, such as the risk presented by quantum computers. For instance, a hash-based signature system like the Lamport signature method might make Bitcoin more resilient against quantum attacks. Researchers are also investigating the use of post-quantum cryptography, which was created to be resistant to quantum computers. The Lamport signature method is considered one of the post-quantum cryptographic methods that can be used to secure digital signatures from potential threats from quantum computers. This technique generates several pairs of public and private keys to verify digital signatures using a one-time hash function. The communication is protected against efforts at quantum hacking since each pair is used to sign a distinct section of the message. Due to the one-time nature of the hash function, even if an attacker gets hold of one of the private keys, they cannot use it to forge other signatures or find the other private keys."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin (BTC) ATM provider Bitcoin of America consented with the Connecticut Department of Banking to halt its operations due to a lack of licensing.\n\nIn a statement released on May 22, the Department of Banking highlighted that Bitcoin of America failed to obtain a proper license to operate Bitcoin ATM kiosks in the state. However, the consent order was enforced after four Connecticut consumers lost tens of thousands of dollars in a scam involving the kiosks in question. The state revealed:\n\n\u201cAs a result of the consent order, Bitcoin of America made restitution to these consumers totaling $86,000. Following a criminal indictment, Bitcoin of America is winding down operations here in Connecticut.\u201d\n\nBanking commissioner Jorge Perez issued a warning against the use of unlicensed crypto kiosks.

        "content": "ChatGPT continues to revolutionize the way financial conversations are conducted, by providing its users with a fast and reliable tool for decision-making.\n\nThe synergy between Bitcoin and ChatGPT is evident in how each technology enables the other to reach its full potential. Bitcoin provides an efficient payment system, while ChatGPT enhances conversational capabilities through natural language processing (NLP) technology.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s NLP algorithms can be used to help improve user experience during financial discussions. It understands human behavior patterns as well as underlying market trends, allowing it to generate intelligent insights that can help inform decisions in real-time.\n\nIn addition, ChatGPT can be integrated with existing blockchain systems, such as Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric, which allows for improved security and stability of financial transactions.\n\nThe synergy between Bitcoin and ChatGPT is further strengthened when it comes to customer service. ChatGPT\u2019s AI-powered chatbot can assist customers with their queries in a fraction of the time taken by human labor, allowing for faster resolution times and better customer satisfaction. It can even use sentiment analysis to detect user emotions, meaning that it can respond appropriately in different scenarios.\n\nUltimately, this combination of technologies enables users to conduct financial conversations in a secure and efficient manner, all while being informed by accurate insights and backed up by reliable security systems.\n\nBy exploring the power of these two revolutionary technologies together, businesses and individuals are sure to benefit from improved communication capabilities as well as enhanced customer service. In short, Bitcoin and ChatGPT offer a powerful synergy that is sure to shape the future of financial conversations.\n\nThe potential for this combination of technologies is limitless, and businesses in all industries should take advantage of it. With Bitcoin and ChatGPT powering their financial conversations, they can expect to streamline operations, increase customer satisfaction, and reduce costs. The true power of these two technologies lies in how they empower each other \u2013 so start exploring today.\n\nChatGPT and its ability to break down complex topics and whitepapers\n\nAnother point of synergy between ChatGPT and Bitcoin is the way in which it can easily break down complex topics like fractional trading and bitcoin halving, as well as whitepapers related to blockchain technology.\n\nFor example, if a user wants to learn more about a certain token or protocol, they can ask ChatGPT an open-ended question such as \u201cWhat is the difference between ERC-20 and ERC-721?\u201d ChatGPT will then provide a comprehensive explanation which could include definitions of both tokens, how they work, their advantages and disadvantages, and any other relevant information.\n\nThis helps users gain a better understanding of cryptocurrency investing without having to strain through pages of technical documents.\n\nBy leveraging the power of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning algorithms, ChatGPT further improves its ability to understand financial questions asked by users. This allows it to provide more accurate and in-depth financial advice tailored specifically for individual portfolios.\n\nChatGPT Portfolios and Investment Advice\n\nA lot of people have been putting a considerable amount of faith is ChatGPT as a money manager and, while, perhaps, still not there yet, it is not unimaginable to consider that one day, investors may be able to have a conversation with ChatGPT that helps them construct the ideal investment portfolio.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to gain in value and acceptance, its inclusion as part of an investor\u2019s portfolio could become more commonplace. With the assistance of ChatGPT, it might even become possible for individuals to craft their own personalized portfolios based on their individual risk profiles and long-term goals.\n\nChatGPT can help create customized financial plans tailored to each investor\u2019s needs. Through intelligent conversations, it can guide users through different options and explain why certain investments may be better suited than others depending on an individual\u2019s risk preference and goals.\n\nThis provides increased autonomy over one\u2019s finances while ensuring guidance is at hand when needed.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to mature, it has the potential to become a key part of investment portfolios. With the help of ChatGPT, investors can receive tailored advice on how best to include Bitcoin in their portfolio and how much to allocate towards it.\n\nThis could be particularly useful for those who are new to investing or cryptocurrency and need some direction when figuring out where and how much they should invest in Bitcoin.\n\nBy combining the power of ChatGPT with the growing acceptance of Bitcoin, investors have access to an unprecedented level of customized financial guidance that allows them to make informed decisions about their investments with confidence.\n\nToken risk analysis\n\nRisk analysis refers to the process of evaluating potential investment opportunities. Risk analysis is based on a set of criteria and typically involves an assessment of potential returns, risks, and costs associated with a given investment strategy.\n\nBy analyzing the risk factors associated with Bitcoin investing, ChatGPT can help you understand how to best manage your investments in order to maximize return while minimizing risk.\n\nChatGPT can generate personalized financial advice tailored specifically for your portfolio, but it is important to keep in mind that ChatGPT and its architects acknowledge that AI is not \u201cqualified\u201d to pick assets.\n\nIt can create custom portfolios that reflect unique strategies and optimize for specific preferences such as low-risk or high-returns. Additionally, it\u2019s capable of generating trading code which allows users to automatically execute trades according to predefined parameters.\n\nFor example, someone who is 45 years old and trying to put money away for retirement might ask ChatGPT something like \u201cWhat is the best way for me to invest $10,000?\u201d ChatGPT can then generate a portfolio of investments that is customized to this individual\u2019s risk tolerance and long-term goals.\n\nThis portfolio could include a combination of Bitcoin, stocks, bonds, and other investments.\n\nChatGPT also offers advice on token risk analysis. It considers factors like market volatility when recommending tokens for investment.\n\nWith its comprehensive understanding of the crypto market and vast insights from the blockchain technology it leverages, ChatGPT can offer valuable advice on which tokens you should buy or sell in order to meet your financial objectives.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s limitations\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize that ChatGPT is still in its relative infancy and, therefore, any guidance it is able to provide users should be approached cautiously.\n\nIt cannot guarantee a return on investment, or make any promises about the performance of an asset over time. As with any investment, it is important for users to do their own research before making financial decisions.\n\nUltimately, the potential synergy between Bitcoin and ChatGPT offers investors unprecedented access to customized financial guidance that helps them make informed decisions with confidence.\n\nBy leveraging its powerful chatbot capabilities, ChatGPT can generate personalized portfolios tailored specifically for individual risk tolerances and goals.\n\nAdditionally, its ability to break down complex topics related to blockchain technology gives users deeper insights into cryptocurrency investments, allowing them to maximize returns while minimizing risks.\n\nWith all these features combined, ChatGPT has become an invaluable asset for investors looking to maximize their success.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe synergy between Bitcoin and ChatGPT is undeniable, offering investors the ability to customize their portfolios, take advantage of token risk analysis, and gain a better understanding of complex topics related to blockchain technology.\n\nBy combining these powerful technologies together, ChatGPT can revolutionize the way people interact with the crypto market and build long-term financial success.\n\nWith its comprehensive understanding of cryptocurrency markets and vast insights from the blockchain technology it leverages, ChatGPT can offer invaluable assistance when it comes to making smart investment decisions and optimizing one\u2019s portfolio."

        "title": "Don't treat crypto like gambling \u2014 even if it is largely pointless - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nEven the heat of Miami can\u2019t warm a crypto winter.\n\nThe faithful descended on Florida last weekend for the world\u2019s \u201cbiggest bitcoin event\u201d. Only half as many made the journey as in 2022. Some of the buzz and meme coins were gone. So was the sense of indestructibility, after a year in which some of the crypto world\u2019s biggest names cratered and US agencies launched a slew of enforcement actions in the sector.\n\nThere was a cold blast from Westminster last week too, where an influential parliamentary committee suggested that crypto was, not disruptive or renegade, but worse: borderline irrelevant. Unbacked cryptoassets, said the Treasury select committee, had \u201cno intrinsic value\u201d and served \u201cno useful social purpose\u201d. The right thing to do to protect consumers, it suggested, was to regulate this activity as gambling.\n\nThis was dismissive, appealing and, I think, wrong. The committee has a point about utility. You can be open-minded about the potential for distributed ledger technology, or even stablecoins and central bank digital currency, and still think cryptocurrencies have totally failed to demonstrate their usefulness, either as a store of value, medium of exchange or tool for financial inclusion. \u201cThe industry still does a very bad job of explaining things,\u201d says Oliver Linch, chief executive of Bittrex Global. \u201cIt\u2019s been wink wink . . . if you know, you know, to the moon nonsense.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s concern was that financial regulation would mean a \u201chalo effect\u201d for that kind of guff, giving a false sense of safety \u2014 a legitimate concern. But \u201cto say it\u2019s gambling makes no sense legally\u201d, says Marc Jones, partner at Stewarts Law firm, noting the ownership aspect to cryptoassets. Nor would it be likely to result in effective regulation.\n\nThe dividing line between financial regulation and gambling is already murky. Spread betting and other types of leveraged trading are taxed as gambling but regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Adverts for betting platforms prominently display that 80 per cent of retail accounts lose money, an at-source version of the FCA\u2019s warnings in the absence of more powers.\n\nMeanwhile, UK gambling regulation is still trying to catch up with the invention of the smartphone. It is \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, says Matt Zarb-Cousin, who campaigns to clean up gambling. This year\u2019s gambling reform proposals belatedly pledge controls on free bets and other inducements. The FCA sent shares in spread-betters tumbling in 2016 with leverage limits and bans on account bonuses and promotions. Crypto (and spread betting) can cause gambling-like harm, says Zarb-Cousin. But better to incorporate protections such as self-exclusion tools into the tougher financial framework.\n\nDividing responsibility between regulators would be a mistake. The crypto universe doesn\u2019t neatly split into conceivably useful and definitely pointless. A split is an invitation for regulatory arbitrage. And the intersection of crypto with mainstream finance should be of as much interest to regulators as the tokens themselves.\n\nThe committee\u2019s report seems unlikely to prompt a change of direction from the government, which in February followed Europe and other jurisdictions such as Hong Kong in proposing to regulate crypto under the UK\u2019s existing financial services framework.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make it insignificant. After much excitable talk about the UK as a \u201cglobal crypto hub\u201d, the mood has shifted \u2014 a shift that, oddly, this latest broadside could reinforce. Crypto will increasingly be asked to play by the rules of mainstream finance. The committee is unlikely to be pushing for a lighter touch in the name of innovation.\n\nThis is also true internationally. The US crackdown rests on protecting investors using the same securities laws and standards as for the rest of finance: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to treat the crypto market differently just because different technology is used,\u201d said SEC chair Gary Gensler last year. Iosco, the co-ordinating body for global securities regulators, this week called for watchdogs to move faster in establishing a \u201clevel playing field between cryptoassets and traditional financial markets\u201d, including breaking up crypto firms where services including broking, trading and custody are combined in a way that would be unacceptable elsewhere.\n\nAll signs to date \u2014 from Binance\u2019s troubles in securing licences, to the low success rate for UK anti-money laundering registration \u2014 suggest that large parts of the crypto world, even those eager for the warm glow of accreditation, will struggle to clear basic hurdles, let alone a like-for-like standard. As the crypto winter lifts, it won\u2019t just be conference audiences that have shrunk.\n\nhelen.thomas@ft.com"

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price failed to break above $27,500 for the fourth time in 12 days on May 23. The subsequent 24-hour rejection down to $26,100 might seem small in absolute terms, but it potentially represents the lowest daily close in 68 days.\n\nAs the deadline for the Bitcoin (BTC) monthly options expiry on May 26 approaches, the fate of the $2.26 billion open interest could determine whether the recent bearish trend will prevail, opening room for a correction down to $25,000 or lower.\n\nBitcoin price and the U.S. debt ceiling debate\n\nAnalysts argue that even if the United States government is able to raise the debt ceiling ahead of the June 1 deadline, risk-on assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies could suffer, as the offer of new U.S. Treasurys would drain liquidity from the market.\n\nThe incentives for fixed income are in place as the one-year instruments return a 5.15% yield and the prospects of an economic crisis increase. Regardless of how the U.S. manages its debt issues, in periods of uncertainty, investors tend to seek shelter in the least risky asset classes.\n\nFor instance, U.S. money market fund assets hit a new record of $5.8 trillion this week as investors turned their focus to short-term debt securities, according to Reuters. Fixed-income mutual funds are a primary source of corporate and municipal funding and have faced $615 billion in net inflows so far this year.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 11% accumulated losses since May 6 might be precisely what bears need to succeed in May\u2019s $2.26 billion monthly options expiry.\n\nBitcoin options: Bulls placed 84% of bets above $29,000\n\nThe open interest for the May 26 options expiry is $2.26 billion, but the actual figure will be lower since bulls were expecting a Bitcoin price above $29,000. These traders were caught by surprise as Bitcoin dropped 10.9% between May 6 and May 12.\n\nBitcoin options open interest for May 26. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.38 put-to-call ratio reflects the imbalance between the $1.64 billion call (buy) open interest and the $630 million in put (sell) options.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $26,500 at 8:00 am UTC on May 26, only $67 million worth of these call options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $27,000 or $28,000 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\nBears aim for sub-$25,000 to secure a $270 million profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on May 26 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $24,000 and $25,000: 900 calls vs. 12,100 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $270 million.\n\n900 calls vs. 12,100 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $270 million. Between $25,000 and $26,000: 1,800 calls vs. 8,900 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $180 million.\n\n1,800 calls vs. 8,900 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $180 million. Between $26,000 and $27,000: 2,600 calls vs. 6,400 puts. Bears\u2019 advantage is reduced to $100 million.\n\n2,600 calls vs. 6,400 puts. Bears\u2019 advantage is reduced to $100 million. Between $27,000 and $28,000: 4,800 calls vs. 5,200 puts. The net result is balanced between call and put instruments.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor example, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nRelated: Why Bitcoin is stuck below $28,000 resistance\n\nBears could use profits to further pressure Bitcoin\u2019s price\n\nBitcoin bulls will likely be satisfied if they manage to come out empty-handed by pushing the Bitcoin price above $27,000 during the expiry. Meanwhile, bears need a mere 2% price drop from $26,300 to secure a $180 million profit.\n\nGiven the bearish momentum for risk-on assets triggered by the U.S. debt ceiling standoff, Bitcoin bears are in a better position for the May $2.26 billion BTC monthly options expiry.\n\nIn short, an expiry price below $26,000 will boost bears\u2019 appetite to further suppress Bitcoin\u2019s price down to $25,000 or lower.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "On May 23\u2019s episode of The Market Report, analyst and writer Marcel Pechman discusses why Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck near $27,000 and how the macroeconomic scenario has become more critical than ever for an eventual breakout. Plus, the show dissects what United States President Joe Biden has been saying about crypto traders being wealthy tax cheaters.\n\nThe first news article shows that the most significant price movements tend to occur after periods of low volatility, as traders tend to get overconfident and add leverage. That creates a perfect storm for a decisive breakout, so, ultimately, stop-loss orders and liquidations further boost the price swing.\n\nPechman does not believe the U.S. Federal Reserve decision on June 14 will be the trigger everyone expects because it\u2019s relatively priced in that the current 5% rate will be maintained. In his 20-year trading experience, Pechman says those events tend to come out of nowhere.\n\nThe show dissects what Biden has been saying about wealthy crypto traders cheating on their taxes. The alleged protections for crypto traders refer to tax-loss harvesting \u2014 a strategy investors use to reduce their overall tax liabilities.\n\nAccording to Pechman, tax-loss harvesting is nothing new and is relatively common in the stock, mutual fund, and commodities markets. There are no grounds for Biden\u2019s baseless differentiation of asset classes, and Pechman does not believe the U.S. president is in a bargaining position right now, with less than 10 days to go before a potential debt default.\n\nThe show\u2019s third and final article covers the speculation of an imminent Bitcoin breakout toward $29,000. The recent sideways price movement is eerily similar to early April when Bitcoin\u2019s 12-hour chart ranged between $27,800 and $28,700 for 11 days.\n\nHowever, Pechman reveals little similarity between the early April bullish breakout and the current status of the Bitcoin futures premium and options risk metric. The bottom line? This time is different, which doesn\u2019t mean bulls can\u2019t get ahead; it\u2019s just less likely according to those metrics.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out! The show is available exclusively on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel."

        "title": "Legendary Investor Michael Saylor to Speak at Europe's Largest Bitcoin Conference BTC Prague - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nPrague, Czech Republic, May 24, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Over 80 exhibiting companies, 130 speakers from all over the world, including one of the most famous figures of the Bitcoin world, Michael J. Saylor, three days of lectures, workshops, and 10 thousand visitors. At the beginning of June, Prague will host the first edition of BTC Prague, the largest and most important event in Europe focused solely on the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nMichael J. Saylor is among the most influential Bitcoin maximalists and key figures in the crypto world. American Michael J. Saylor founded the company MicroStrategy, which regularly buys Bitcoins as part of its corporate assets and with 132,000 Bitcoins, the richest cryptocurrency company in the world, and will now speak in Europe for the first time. This will happen during the BTC Prague conference, the Bitcoin event of the year, which will take place from June 8th to 10th at the PVA Let\u0148any exhibition center in Prague.\n\n\"Michael has an excellent reputation and strong and consistent views that carry significant weight in the Bitcoin community, and he is also a person who opened the doors to Bitcoin adoption by traditional companies. That is why I am glad that we managed to persuade him to speak for the first time in Europe at our event,\" says Martin Kucha\u0159, one of the organizers of BTC Prague. \"With an estimated attendance of 10,000, a conference that is unrivaled, not just in the Czech Republic, but also across Europe.\"\n\nIn addition to Saylor, a number of other influential personalities in the Bitcoin world, including Blockstream CEO Dr. Adam Back, SatoshiLabs co-founder Marek Palatinus, and Robert Breedlove, author of the popular \"What is Money?\" podcast, have accepted invitations to Europe\u2019s largest exclusively Bitcoin-focused conference. The bi-lingual Czech-English program promises to offer a wealth of stimulating ideas for entrepreneurs, researchers, influencers, philosophers, developers, and advocates of freedom g throughout the course of the three-day event.\n\nStory continues\n\nRunning parallel to the program on stage, the expo will also take place, showcasing over 100 companies focused on building Bitcoin infrastructure. These include providers of hardware and software wallets, mining tools, exchanges, or even beer taps connected to the Lightning Network. Among the exhibitors, there will be one exclusive guest - El Salvador. The Central American country, which made history two years ago as the first in the world to make Bitcoin the official national currency, is sending a government delegation to Prague to share their experience and review the implications of their groundbreaking decision at the crypto event of the year.\n\nThe BTC Prague organizers aim to appeal not only to seasoned Bitcoin enthusiasts but also to those who have some knowledge of Bitcoin yet are not fully immersed in it. Their ambition is to guide these individuals through the entire Bitcoin journey.\n\n\"In the current complex economic situation, when we all feel the effects of inflation, uncertainties surrounding the stability of banks or high-interest rates, Bitcoin is proving to be a kind of lifeboat. It is certainly riskier today not to have it than to have it. Therefore, we want to focus heavily on newcomers, to make it easier for them to enter the Bitcoin world and practically show them how to do it,\" says Martin Kucha\u0159.\n\nMartin, a significant figure in the domestic Bitcoin scene, along with his brother Matyas, has been instrumental in organizing four successful annual Bitcoin events known as ChainCamp. These events attract over 2,000 enthusiasts each year in Ostrava. Moving to Prague and significantly expanding the scale of the entire event is a logical culmination of both brothers' journey or rather the growing popularity of Bitcoin.\n\nThe fact that the largest and most significant Bitcoin conference will take place in Prague is symbolic, as Martin Kuchar says, the Czech Republic is the \"Bitcoin Valley\" of the crypto world and Prague could boldly be called the world capital of Bitcoin because of a number of revolutionary projects that played a key role in the adoption of the world's largest cryptocurrency was created in the Czech Republic. We can name, for example, the hardware wallet Trezor from SatoshiLabs or the first mining pool from Braiins, or Bitcoin ATMs from General Bytes. \"I see BTC Prague as another Czech project that confirms the importance of the Czech Republic for Bitcoin,\" adds Martin Kuchar.\n\nCONTACT: Alnura Belyalova Director of PR, Luna PR alnura@lunapr.io\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Bitcoin Pizza Day was supposed to be a celebration of crypto utility, but instead it was dampened by a flurry of new pizza-themed memecoins that swindled thousands of dollars from investors.\n\nEvery May 22, many crypto and Bitcoin faithful celebrate the anniversary of when, in 2010, a computer developer named Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoin, a sum now worth more than $260 million.\n\nWhile many crypto users (and some company executives) this year celebrated and shared jokes on Crypto Twitter, others ginned up memecoins that accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars in market capitalization before rugging investors.\n\n#Bitcoin Pizza Day \u2013 CZ giving tips on making the best #BinancePizza pic.twitter.com/yMEMyzV1dG \u2014 Richard Teng (@_RichardTeng) May 22, 2023\n\nIn total, four tokens\u2014BTCPizza, BPizza, PizzaDay, and EthPizza\u2014that all were created within the past three days have accumulated more than $300,000 in market cap, according to Dextools. It\u2019s possible there were more.\n\nThe team or person behind BPizza, the new memecoin with the second-largest investment total, quickly changed its sell tax, to 100%, meaning it would be unfeasible for investors to sell it. Meanwhile, EthPizza turned off transfers and sales for the token shortly after accumulating a market cap of $38,000.\n\nThe coin with the highest market cap, BTCPizza, was still trading as of Wednesday afternoon at a market cap of nearly $200,000. The token\u2019s price was down 16% from its high on Tuesday.\n\nMemecoins are highly volatile and are backed by nothing but hype. They have no practical use and quite often are scams for unsuspecting investors seeking the next big thing.\n\nOne of the latest, and perhaps most surprising memecoin moons, came from Pepe coin, which quickly peaked at market cap of $1.6 billion before plummeting. The coin still had a market cap of more than $250 million on Wednesday, according to CoinMarketCap."

        "content": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has received optimism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) one year since it adopted Bitcoin (BTC). The IMF\u2019s positive outlook reflects the country\u2019s economic prospects and the impact of embracing the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nThe IMF published a report expressing a more positive view of the country\u2019s economic prospects for 2023. The report indicates a projected rebound in real gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 2.2%, attributed to factors such as the base effect and policy adjustments leading to enhanced fuel supply. The IMF also anticipates an average inflation rate of 6.3% for 2023.\n\nAccording to the IMF document, the projected public debt of the CAR is expected to remain sustainable. However, the report highlights the presence of significant liquidity risks, as indicated by relevant debt indicators. These risks arise from potential shortfalls in donor support and challenges in accessing domestic and regional markets.\n\nThe CAR made history by becoming the second country in the world, after El Salvador, to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender. Despite being one of the poorest nations in the world, the CAR is harnessing the potential of Bitcoin to reshape its financial infrastructure and boost its economic prospects.\n\nFollowing the approval of Bitcoin as legal tender in CAR, the government wasted no time in laying the groundwork for digital currency integration. CAR President, Faustin-Archange Touadera, revealed the initiative called Sango Project, marking the country\u2019s entry into the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nRelated: IMF sees room for eNaira improvement in first-year assessment\n\nIn December 2022, the CAR announced a delay in the listing of Sango Coin on crypto exchanges. The decision was attributed to prevailing market conditions and marketing considerations. On March 31, the organization behind Sango Coin announced further delays \u201cjust for a few weeks,\u201d citing legal and regulatory obstacles.\n\nIn January 2023, the Sango Project revealed that a government task force is actively working on legal amendments to enable the smooth integration of the cryptocurrency.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum: Can we fix it?"

In 2019, China said it would begin restricting residents\u2019 access to international exchanges as part of the country\u2019s crypto crackdown.\n\nThat same year, the White House released a report that linked fentanyl trafficking to cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero\u2014the so-called \u201cprivacy coin\u201d that\u2019s become popular on dark web marketplaces.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s report claimed that cryptocurrencies are the \u201cpredominant funding mechanisms associated with fentanyl trafficking.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent Taproot upgrade birthed a new protocol known as Taproot Ordinals. This innovation now allows users to mint BRC-20 tokens on Bitcoin. While these tokens are still somewhat under the radar, their impact is increasingly evident in Bitcoin transaction numbers. The growing demand has put a strain on Bitcoin, resulting in higher transaction fees. For investors wanting BRC-20 tokens, availability is a key concern.\n\nMultiple projects are rising to tackle these challenges, including a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform called ALEX.\n\nFostering DeFi growth\n\nIn April 2021, entrepreneurs Dr. Chiente Hsu and Ms. Rachel Yu noted the rapid expansion of DeFi and the relative lack of mainstream adoption. To help DeFi mature, they decided to create ALEX, an automated liquidity exchange. Instead of building on Ethereum or another newer network, Hsu and Yu chose to build their DeFi solution on the Bitcoin blockchain. With their Wall Street backgrounds, entrepreneurs knew that trust was key in financial services, making Bitcoin the perfect choice.\n\nToday, as BRC-20 tokens become more popular, ALEX has introduced a new platform called B20 By ALEX. This platform is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built specifically for trading BRC-20 and all other upcoming Bitcoin L1 tokens. B20 promises an easy-to-use trading experience like centralized exchanges while also offering the security of Bitcoin\u2019s base layer.\n\nUnifying liquidity\n\nB20 By ALEX is aiming to unite the currently fragmented liquidity of BRC-20 tokens. It processes transactions on a separate layer and then settles them all at once. This setup helps speed up trading on the DEX and reduces strain on the Bitcoin network.\n\nB20 offers features like stop-loss orders and lending and borrowing services. Price discovery is based on market participants\u2019 bids and asks, and the order book offers a deeper look into market depth and sentiment.\n\nSource: ALEX\n\nALEX\u2019s goal is to make Bitcoin as useful as Ethereum. The team believes that the future of DeFi is intertwined with Bitcoin, given its trusted and secure nature.\n\nA two-pronged solution\n\nThe BRC-20 market\u2019s fast growth has put significant pressure on Bitcoin, leading to higher transaction fees and some negativity around the DeFi movement on Bitcoin. However, with its L2 infrastructure, B20 can help address these issues.\n\nBy processing transactions on a separate layer, then bundling and settling them on Bitcoin, B20 keeps transaction fees low and maintains scalability. This approach improves the trading experience and alleviates strain on Bitcoin.\n\nWith the launch of B20, ALEX is showcasing its commitment to becoming a significant player in the DeFi space. The co-founder and CEO of ALEX, Chiente Hsu, shared her ambitious vision:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the bigger picture. We believe DeFi can eliminate the need for centralized entities. As the world\u2019s wealth becomes tokenized, Bitcoin\u2019s security and the innovative tools we\u2019re building will become invaluable.\u201d\n\nALEX has also launched an AMM DEX, and it offers services like yield farming, staking, and an IDO launchpad, all of which are integrated with Bitcoin.\n\nSource: ALEX\n\nLearn more about ALEX"

        "title": "How the Lightning Network could solve Bitcoin's speed and scale conundrums - OKX",
        "content": "The emergence of ordinals and BRC-20 tokens sparked a lively debate within the Bitcoin community. On the one hand, enthusiasts celebrated the newfound potential these innovations bring to the Bitcoin blockchain. On the other hand, concerns have been raised about the rise in gas fees, longer transaction times, and the potential occupation of valuable block space by ordinals and BRC-20 tokens.\n\nMost BRC-20 tokens use ordinal inscriptions of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data to create, deploy, and transfer tokens. However, this method is criticized by developers for being far more expensive in transaction fees compared to using binary.\n\nBitcoin has encountered concerns like this before, particularly regarding scalability. For example, in the past, transactions on the Bitcoin network could take a few minutes to several hours to finalize, not to mention the high gas fees encountered.\n\nThe good news is, Lightning Labs recently released its rebranded version of Taro, now called the Taproot Asset Protocol, which aims to help alleviate network congestion, lower gas fees, and bridge BRC-20 to another advancement that's helping solve some of Bitcoin's challenges: the Lightning Network.\n\nIn 2018, the Lightning Network, a layer 2 payment protocol layered on top of Bitcoin, launched to make transactions faster, cheaper, and more efficient.\n\nOKX is one of the major exchanges to embrace the Lightning Network, integrating it seamlessly into our platform. This forward-thinking move enables our users to enjoy lightning-fast deposits and withdrawals, making transactions smoother and more efficient.\n\nWill, from our Product Marketing team, has put together a video tutorial on how you can deposit and withdraw Bitcoin using the Lightning Network with OKX. Let's find out more about it.\n\nWhat is the Lightning Network?\n\nThe Lightning Network is an innovative payment protocol designed to supercharge your transactions. When you make a transaction with the Bitcoin blockchain, it needs to be recorded by the entire network, which takes time. The Lightning Network allows users to create private payment channels directly between themselves, bypassing the need for every transaction to be broadcast on the entire network and therefore saving time.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to send some Bitcoin to a friend. Both of you hop on the Lightning Network and open a private channel. Once the channel is open, both of you can conduct an unlimited number of transactions with each other without needing to record each transaction on the blockchain.\n\nThese off-chain transactions are only known between yourself and your friend involved in the channel, providing privacy and reducing the load on the main blockchain. The Lightning Network uses smart contracts to establish trust between yourself and those you invite to your private channel to make sure of proper funds settlement.\n\nIt allows for instant payments and increased scalability since transactions can be processed within the payment channel without needing confirmation from the entire Bitcoin network. This dramatically reduces transaction fees and improves the overall speed and efficiency of the Bitcoin network.\n\nDepending on network congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain, you may be paying more in gas fees than what you're trying to send to your friend. The Lightning Network is also a tangible solution for Bitcoin micropayments.\n\nThe Lightning Network, as previously mentioned, operates as a layer 2 solution that seamlessly integrates with the existing Bitcoin infrastructure. Instead of modifying the fundamental Bitcoin protocol, it establishes an extra layer that works in parallel with it.\n\nIt's important to flag that Lightning Network and Lightning Labs are distinct entities. While both are related to Lightning technology, they serve different purposes. The Lightning Network refers to the decentralized payment protocol itself. Meanwhile, Lightning Labs is responsible for maintaining the Lightning Network and developing the network\u2019s technology. The Lightning Network developers created LDN, an implementation of the Lightning Network protocol. It serves as a software framework that allows developers and users to interact with the Lightning Network. And, they're the developers behind the Taproot Assets Protocol.\n\nLightning Labs is also behind the @Lightning Twitter account, not the Lightning Network protocol.\n\nLightning Labs Taproot Assets Protocol\n\nLightning Labs recently announced the Taproot Assets Protocol, which aims to provide a more efficient method for users to create new assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. In addition, by operating \"maximally off-chain,\" the protocol seeks to avoid network congestion, a persistent issue on the Bitcoin network since the introduction of the BRC-20 token standard by anonymous developer \"Domo\" on March 8, 2023.\n\nWith the Taproot Assets Protocol, users can seamlessly integrate BRC-20 assets into the Lightning Network. This means that wallets, exchanges, and merchants can simply be ported over instead of starting a new ecosystem from scratch, streamlining the process for everyone involved. This development holds great promise for enhancing the usability and scalability of the Bitcoin network.\n\nWhere has the Lightning Network been integrated?\n\nThe Lightning Network continues to grow in both functionality and adoption, with various major players in crypto and beyond now integrating the technology. OKX and Binance both offer users the option to process BTC payments via the Lightning Network, providing unprecedented speed when completing transactions.\n\nCoinbase is also reportedly looking to add the Lightning Network to its platform for BTC payments. Meanwhile, Kraken, Bitfinex, River Financial, and CoinCorner have also integrated the network with their respective platforms. Meanwhile, July 2023 saw Lightning Labs announce a new suite of developer tools that integrate Bitcoin with artificial intelligence and Large Language Models such as ChatGPT. Now, these technologies can hold, receive, and send Bitcoin via the Lightning Network, as well as on-chain.\n\nAlso in 2023, Google Cloud partnered with Lightning-as-a-Service provider Voltage to increase its hosting capacity and expand Voltage\u2019s global reach. The partnership allows Voltage users to create Bitcoin Lightning nodes anywhere in the world through Google Cloud, providing cheaper and ultra-fast payment processing compared to alternative options. As the core of Voltage's client base place payment processing at the center of their business, the Google Cloud collaboration could help boost network activity and guide more players towards the Lightning Network.\n\nThese developments and partnerships underline the versatility and wider potential for the Lightning Network beyond its core applications, signaling that further growth for the network could lie ahead.\n\nThe benefits of the Lightning Network\n\nThe Lightning Network has gained significant attention, especially around the hype of BRC-20 and ordinals, by providing users with speedy transactions and low gas fees. The benefits go well beyond this.\n\nSpeed: Lightning Network transactions are confirmed within seconds, significantly faster than Bitcoin blockchain transactions.\n\nCost: Lightning Network transactions are generally more cost-effective than Bitcoin blockchain transactions.\n\nPrivacy: Lightning Network transactions offer enhanced privacy compared to Bitcoin blockchain transactions.\n\nThe Limitations of the Lightning Network\n\nWhile the Lightning Network has a dedicated team of developers and enthusiasts behind it, it imposes some limitations you should know of. And, it's important to do your own research before participating in a protocol.\n\nLiquidity: One core challenge of the Lightning Network is receiving liquidity. Currently, users can't receive funds over the network until they\u2019ve received funding liquidity from another user\u2019s node.\n\nChannel capacity: The Lightning Network's payment channels have a maximum fund capacity, limiting the size of transactions within each channel.\n\nNetwork routing: As the Lightning Network expands, finding efficient routes between participants for transactions becomes increasingly complex, potentially resulting in slower or failed transactions.\n\nSecurity: The Lightning Network has some security concerns, such as the risk of fund theft if hackers compromise a user's node.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe Lightning Network is indeed a promising technology that holds the potential to enhance the usefulness and accessibility of Bitcoin. While it's constantly being developed, it addresses the need for faster and more cost-effective transactions.\n\nHowever, like any evolving technology, the network has limitations requiring attention and resolution before widespread adoption can be seen. Nevertheless, as further advancements and refinements are made, the Lightning Network will continue to bring us closer to a more efficient and scalable blockchain ecosystem.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nTHIS ARTICLE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

        "title": "Energy Web Launches Certification for Sustainable Bitcoin Mining - GlobeNewswire",
        "content": "ZUG, Switzerland, May 24, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Energy Web, an independent non-profit that develops open-source software for clean energy solutions, today announced the launch of Green Proofs for Bitcoin (GP4BTC), a first-of-its kind initiative to establish an independent, standardized energy measurement system for the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\n\n\nGP4BTC will provide transparency into the decarbonization efforts of Bitcoin miners and hosting companies, supporting the industry on its journey to net-zero. As part of the solution, certifications will be issued to Bitcoin miners based on their clean energy use and contributions to grid stability via demand response. By delivering verifiable metrics that are consistent across companies and geographies, GP4BTC will provide recognition and reputational benefit for companies mining sustainably, as well as improved access to institutional finance and other returns on their investments into sustainability practices.\n\nSpeaking on the launch of the certification initiative, Amy Westervelt, Senior Delivery Lead and head of the GP4BTC initiative at Energy Web, said \u201cToday Bitcoin is scrutinized for its electricity consumption and associated climate impact. While leading miners are pursuing strategies to reduce their carbon footprints, the industry lacks a unifying definition of sustainable mining, as well as a shared framework for assessing and verifying miners\u2019 sustainability practices. Green Proofs for Bitcoin seeks to provide this.\u201d\n\nLaunched with five certified miners, the GP4BTC certification platform and registry assesses miners via a Clean Energy Score and a Grid Impact Score, each of which are calculated based on operational information including location and energy consumption data. Together, these scores reflect miners\u2019 procurement of renewable electricity, siting operations in regions with low grid carbon intensity, and their contributions to grid stability through demand flexibility.\n\nDeveloped in partnership with over 35 miners, NGOs, grid operators, and other energy and crypto market participants, this approach to scoring is aligned with best practices for sustainability leadership in other industries, and to approaches to corporate ESG reporting in the financial sector and beyond.\n\n\u201cUntil now, efforts to standardize clean energy procurement practices and drive collective action across the Bitcoin mining sector have been siloed and inconsistent,\u201d added Westervelt. \u201cWhile other electricity-intensive industries have benefited from custom decarbonization roadmaps, Bitcoin has largely been ignored, creating a negative feedback loop where climate-conscious miners are left to forge their own paths. Our goal is to create a virtuous cycle where clean mining is easier to define, pursue, and monetize\u2014so that it eventually becomes the status quo.\u201d\n\nFor miners, GP4BTC offers a solution for miners to provide evidence of clean energy practices. Using Energy Web\u2019s privacy-first Green Proofs technology, miners retain full ownership and control of their data. For Bitcoin users and institutions, GP4BTC provides a one-stop-shop for discovering and validating miners' sustainability credentials so they can make data-driven decisions regarding commercial strategy and policy.\n\nAt launch, certified miners and data centers include Argo Blockchain, Cowa, DMG Blockchain Solutions, Hive Blockchain Technologies, and Gryphon Digital Mining.\n\nDMG\u2019s CEO, Sheldon Bennett, commented, \u201cWe are pleased to be included among the initial Green Proofs for Bitcoin miner participants. We believe Energy Web\u2019s launch of Green Proofs for Bitcoin represents a real first step towards recognizing a broad swath of industry participants for powering their data center equipment utilizing primarily carbon neutral energy sources.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis initiative will settle the basis for long term sustainability within the Bitcoin mining industry. We are proud to contribute to the growth of the ecosystem and to have the ability to certify our commitment towards sustainability,\u201d said Fiorenzo Manganiello, co-founder of Cowa.\n\n\u201cDecarbonization represents one of the main priorities for the sector, and by providing standardized and verifiable metrics, as well as acknowledging best practices with certifications, initiatives such as Energy Web\u2019s Green Proofs for Bitcoin serve a fundamental role in driving industry standards. At Argo, sustainable mining has been at the core of our business model and growth strategy ever since our foundation. We are proud of our GP4BTC certification, and we look forward to contributing to the impact and success of this exciting initiative,\u201d said Seif El-Bakly, Interim CEO at Argo Blockchain.\n\nPresident and CEO of Hive Blockchain Technologies Aydin Kilic commented, \u201cIn our commitment to be green energy focused\u2014which has been our mandate since HIVE went public back in 2017 as the first publicly traded crypto miner\u2014we are glad to see the industry embracing this strategy, and advocates like Energy Web helping to validate and certify the renewable aspects of crypto miners. This makes our industry stronger.

        "content": "Big figures in the cryptocurrency industry are calling that Bitcoin has reached its bottom, and the world's biggest cryptocurrency is now rallying.\n\nOne of the biggest figures in the cryptocurrency space has said that Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, has said that Bitcoin has bottomed out and a new bull run has started.\n\n3\n\nMichael Saylor\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 3 IMAGES\n\nPopular Now: Scientists unveil PC breakthrough that gives 2x speed without hardware upgrades\n\nMichael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, has become one of the few Bitcoin maximalists to publicly embrace Ordinals, a protocol that allows for arbitrary and non-financial information to be included on the Bitcoin blockchain. In an interview at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, Saylor discussed his views on Ordinals, its potential use cases, and the ongoing debates within the Bitcoin community.\n\nSaylor sees Ordinals as a positive development for Bitcoin, although he acknowledges that many of the early use cases are more speculative than serious. He stated, \"What if I was using them to tokenize all of the stocks and ETFs trading on NASDAQ so that individuals can take personal custody of their shares of stock instead of leaving them locked up with a centralized custodian? If it was presented that way, then Bitcoiners would love it.\"\n\n3\n\nAddressing concerns about potential unregistered securities, Saylor emphasized the importance of ethical and legal regulation. He said, \"If BRC-20 tokens are viewed as fungible tokens to issue unregistered securities, there's a lot of objection to that because it's unethical. It's illegal. And you can't blame [the community] for objecting to that.\" However, he believes that if BRC-20 tokens are issued and regulated in an ethical and legal manner, there should be no issue.\n\nSaylor also shared his perspective on the ongoing bull run of Bitcoin. He attributed the market's upward trajectory to factors such as Bitcoin's halving, increased adoption of the cryptocurrency, and a regulatory crackdown that benefits Bitcoin by weeding out competitors like Ethereum. He stated, \"You're going to see a consistent flow of capital flowing from the rest of the crypto ecosystem [into] bitcoin.\"\n\nMoreover, Saylor highlighted the recent proposed guidance on crypto accounting and reporting by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which provides further clarity and transparency for companies that hold crypto assets on their balance sheets. He said, \"The FASB initiative to adopt fair value accounting is a very auspicious development.\"\n\nIn addition to Ordinals' growing activity on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin's halving event, set to occur in April 2024, is expected to enhance scarcity and potentially drive the cryptocurrency's price higher. Saylor expressed confidence in Bitcoin's current state, stating, \"I think bitcoin's found the bottom. I think the leverage is out of it. I think we're on a bull run.\"\n\nSaylor's support for Ordinals comes at a time when transaction fees on Ethereum have soared, leading to discussions within the Bitcoin community about potential network attacks and the need for censorship. While Saylor acknowledges that Ordinals' early use cases may be seen as speculative, he believes in the importance of allowing the free market to function and for individuals to invest in what they believe in. He firmly stated, \"Do I think we should modify the protocol to censor certain types of transactions? My answer is no.\"\n\nSaylor's stance reflects his commitment to the principles of decentralization and freedom of choice within the Bitcoin ecosystem. As the Bitcoin community continues to debate the role of Ordinals and navigate regulatory challenges, Michael Saylor remains optimistic about Bitcoin's future and believes that market forces and free choice should guide the cryptocurrency's development."

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price rally in 2017 was largely driven by the ICO craze kicked off by Ethereum and a focus on altcoins.\n\nWhile the 2023 YTD price increase is driven by institutions and large wallet investors, the 2017 cycle was largely supported by retail traders.\n\nProfit rotation from altcoins drove a Bitcoin price rally in 2017, while DeFi-related assets take the center stage in 2023.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price cycles are structured around halving events that occur once roughly every four years, when rewards to miners are cut in half. The next BTC halving is expected in early 2024, and evaluating the differences between the 2015 to 2017 and 2020 to 2023 Bitcoin cycles can help traders define their expectations and prepare for the bull run.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC to surprise investors with 10% sell-off\n\nComparing two Bitcoin price cycles and whale activity\n\nBitcoin\u2019s massive price rally in its 2015 to 2017 cycle set a record. However, the 2020 to 2023 cycle, which sent BTC to an all-time high of $69,044, has different catalysts and players. Still, the two Bitcoin price cycles followed a similar trajectory: it started with a bullish catalyst that was followed by capital rotation into BTC and massive participation from key players in the ecosystem.\n\nThe two cycles, however, differed in terms of the role played by retail and institutional traders, as well as activity of large wallet investors, popularly known as whales, in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nThe 2015 to 2017 Bitcoin price cycle is considered one of the most iconic ones and can be summarized as follows:\n\nInitial Coin Offering (ICO) spree initiated by Ethereum.\n\nAltcoins, shitcoins and everything in between.\n\nCapital rotation into Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin price rally to $19,665 in mid-December 2017 was fueled by a massive participation of retail investors.\n\nBitcoin whales pushed BTC price to its 2017 cycle top\n\nBased on data from crypto intelligence tracker Santiment, there was a consistent rise in the number of large wallet addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC. At the beginning of 2015, there were 13,903 addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 Bitcoin, 1,438 addresses containing between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC and 90 wallets holding between 10,000 to 100,000 Bitcoin.\n\nAll three segments of large wallet investors on Bitcoin witnessed a consistent increase from 2015 to the 2017 cycle top, after which there was a notable decline. Bitcoin price is represented by the green line.\n\nBitcoin whale wallet address count through segments in the 2015 to 2017 cycle\n\nAs seen in the chart above, a large segment of retail traders accumulated BTC at a discount, before price started rallying in the second half of 2017.\n\nThe 2015 to 2017 Bitcoin cycle in a glimpse\n\nIn 2017, Bitcoin acted as a gateway for market participants to jump in on the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) craze, where traders exchanged BTC for altcoins and the popularly known shitcoins, currencies with little to no discernible purpose and low value. This fueled a massive spike in demand for Bitcoin and acted as a catalyst for its price rally.\n\nThe following chart from TradingView puts Bitcoin\u2019s dominance into perspective and signals a massive decline after the 2017 bull run, at a moment when altcoins gained relevance and popularity. In the 2015 to 2017 cycle, capital rotated from altcoins to Bitcoin, giving the flagship cryptocurrency an edge over the others, but this changed at the cycle\u2019s end.\n\nMarket Capitalization Bitcoin dominance %\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance fell from nearly 100% at the beginning of 2015 to just over 96% in 2017.\n\nHow the 2020 to 2023 Bitcoin cycle is different\n\nThe 2020 to 2023 BTC price cycle kicked off in a similar fashion as previous cycles. In this case, the bullish catalyst was Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, instead of the ICO craze. . DeFi emerged as the biggest highlight of 2020, going from $700 million locked in contracts at the beginning of 2020 to as much as $15 billion by the end of that year.\n\nCompound was one of the largest DeFi players as it allowed traders to deposit crypto into lending pools that facilitated borrowing. Lenders, in turn, earned an interest on the assets they deposited, fueling the DeFi spree that lasted all summer, with several copy cats and similar protocols offering the service to market participants.\n\nA wave of food-themed DeFi tokens flooded the market, with SushiSwap (SUSHI), BurgerSwap (BURGER), Yam Finance (YAM), BakerySwap (BAKE), Pizza (PIZZA), Hotdog.Swap (HOTDOG), and Kimchi Finance (KIMCHI) taking the lead. Capital rotated from these assets to Bitcoin and BTC\u2019s rally in the first half of the cycle was also driven largely by retail traders.\n\nLater, MicroStrategy\u2019s incursion into Bitcoin started the era of mass institutional participation in crypto. Investment banks, funds and hedge funds turned to Bitcoin as an opportunity to amass returns for their clients. Tesla\u2019s $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase in 2021 contributed to the shift of traditional markets\u2019 attention into the crypto ecosystem, leading to a rally in Bitcoin price that was fueled by a frenzy among large wallet investors and institutions.\n\nWhale transactions worth $1 million or higher, represented in blue, climbed steadily throughout 2020, hitting a peak in early 2021 and Q3 2021. This signals an increase in participation by large wallet investors on the Bitcoin network in the 2020-2023 cycle.\n\nWhale transaction count (valued at $100,000 or higher), represented by yellow bars, peaked in the months leading up to BTC\u2019s run up to its peak of $69,044.71 in November 2021. The chart below focuses on the role of whales in Bitcoin price cycles and the critical role played in the 2021 bull run.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin whale participation and activity\n\nWhales emerged as one of the dominant catalysts in Bitcoin\u2019s price cycles. When BTC price hit its all-time high of $69,044.71, both segments of whale transactions climbed to their peaks, highlighting the importance of these participants in Bitcoin\u2019s cycles.\n\nRising whale transaction count can therefore be considered a sign of an impending BTC price rally, based on data from the 2015 to 2017 and the 2020 to 2023 cycles. While Bitcoin price cycles do not repeat, and the catalysts which start them can change, there seems to be a common factor pushing the BTC price higher every time: whales."

        "content": "Canadian Bitcoin mining corporation Upstream Data Inc. has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Delaware limited liability company Crusoe Energy Systems LLC in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Crusoe has infringed on Upstream's patent related to bitcoin mining technology used to convert stranded natural gas into bitcoin. According to the complaint, Upstream holds the patent for a system that powers a blockchain mine at remote oil well sites using stranded gas to generate electricity for cryptocurrency mining. According to the filing, the company has deployed over 350 bitcoin mining systems across the U.S. and Canada, addressing the issue of stranded gas venting and flaring.\n\nCrusoe, which manufactures and operates cryptocurrency mining systems connected to stranded natural gas sources, is accused of competing with Upstream by selling and operating similar systems. The complaint claims that Crusoe's \"Digital Flare Mitigation\" systems infringe on Upstream's patented technology. The lawsuit further alleges that Crusoe was aware of Upstream's patented technology during the development of its own products. The lawsuit filing highlights instances where Crusoe identified Upstream as a competitor in blog posts and claims made in patent applications.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks damages and injunctive relief against Crusoe for patent infringement. Upstream argues that Crusoe's actions have caused harm to its business by infringing on its patent rights and creating unfair competition in the market.\n\nThe case will be heard in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, where Crusoe has regular and established places of business according to the filing. Also noted in the lawsuit is a complaint filed against a customer of Upstream in Crusoe Energy Systems LLC v. Alkane Midstream LLC, which the lawsuit says \"further confirm[s] Crusoe\u2019s significant and substantial contacts with this district.\" Upstream asserts in the lawsuit that the court has jurisdiction over the case.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "The elusive $100k mark for Bitcoin (BTC) has kept investors on their toes, but there\u2019s a fresh face in the crypto world that\u2019s generating significant buzz and might just reach that milestone faster. Welcome to the world of Tradecurve (TCRV), a new cryptocurrency that\u2019s currently in its presale phase and has experts predicting it will hit $100k before 2025.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction\n\nThe value of Bitcoin (BTC) has been a roller coaster ride for investors in 2023. Starting the year at $15.6K, Bitcoin (BTC) grew to $31K in less than four months. Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is valued at around $27.4K after a recent dip. There are various predictions for where Bitcoin (BTC) might go in the future but a common one among experts is that it will reach $100k by 2027.\n\nThe most bullish Bitcoin (BTC) analysts believe that as more people lose trust in traditional banking, Bitcoin (BTC) will become a more reliable investment and surge to new highs during 2024. However, others believe that the current economic uncertainty will considerably slow down its growth.\n\nTo try and anticipate what will happen next in the short term, it\u2019s recommended to watch certain two price levels: $25K and $31K. If Bitcoin (BTC) breaks through the $31K level, it will likely continue its uptrend to reach $50K within months.\n\nA drop below $25K will likely result in a significant price correction and could significantly delay the milestone of reaching $100K as investors lose confidence in the asset. It is clear that momentum is essential to reach the coveted six-figure mark.\n\nThe Crypto Set to Eclipse Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nNot all investors want to wait five years, however, and many are looking for ways to invest in cryptocurrencies that could appreciate faster than Bitcoin (BTC). The cryptocurrency on everybody\u2019s lips is Tradecurve (TCRV).\n\nTradecurve is an all-encompassing trading platform that lets users trade digital currencies, stocks, commodities like gold, and even forex. This isn\u2019t just a place for crypto enthusiasts \u2014 it\u2019s a one-stop shop for traders.\n\nThe great thing about Tradecurve is that it doesn\u2019t come with a complicated sign-up process. You just need an email address and a DeFi wallet, and you\u2019re good to go \u2014 no need to jump through regulatory hoops or sign up for costly trading accounts.\n\nTradecurve isn\u2019t just about the basics. It also equips users with high-tech tools to boost their trading game. For instance, there are automated trading tools that use artificial intelligence and deep data analysis to help maximize profits.\n\nThe TCRV token is at the heart of Tradecurve. Holders of these tokens get special perks, like the chance to earn passive income, and lower fees on their trades.\n\nThe Tradecurve development team has locked up the liquidity pool for two years and the team\u2019s own tokens for three years. Plus, they\u2019ve had their smart contracts thoroughly checked out by Cyber Scope to make sure everything\u2019s as secure as possible.\n\nWith TCRV tokens currently in presale for just 12 cents, early investors could see a huge return on their investment if the token hits $100,000. Tradecurve\u2019s innovative technology and its team of experienced professionals have given this token a chance to make history, with some experts predicting it may get there even sooner than Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nFor more information about TCRV presale tokens:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

The Bahamas-based business had been valued at $32bn less than a year earlier.\n\nJennifer Craven, fraud expert at law firm Pinsent Masons, said the figures reflected how widespread crypto crime had become.\n\n\u201c[The figures] align with the sharp increase in English High Court actions commenced by victims of crypto fraud who are determined to recover their losses by civil remedial means,\u201d she added.\n\nCryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are largely unregulated in the UK. In February, the Treasury set out draft proposals for the regulation of crypto assets, including new requirements on exchanges to ringfence customers\u2019 money in the event of insolvency.\n\nMPs on the House of Commons\u2019 Treasury select committee said last week that cryptocurrencies should be regulated in a similar way to the gambling sector, given it had \u201cno intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good\u201d.\n\nRPC said the losses could also reflect the collapse of crypto-related Ponzi schemes that were unable to continue as the value of the cryptocurrencies they were based on cratered.\n\nThe value of bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency, fell as low as $15,700 on November 10, 2022, the day before FTX filed for bankruptcy, according to cryptocurrency site CoinGecko.\n\nThe currency is at present valued at $26,200 per bitcoin, down more than 60 per cent since its high of just over $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nIn the UK government\u2019s national fraud strategy, a blueprint released earlier this month for how it will clamp down on financial crime, it pledged to ban cold calls on all financial and investment products.\n\nHowever, many companies said the strategy did not go far enough and called for online platforms, where many scams originate, to face further tougher rules."

This article takes a dive into the platform\u2019s ecosystem and how to stake GRT.\n\nHave you seen The Graph\u2019s brand new homepage yet? \ud83d\udc40 It's now easier than ever to visualize how The Graph works & discover how to get involved \ud83d\udcab See it for yourself \u2b07\ufe0f \ud83c\udf10 https://t.co/3YVpq4Z343 pic.twitter.com/5ZNBf95eVE \u2014 The Graph (@graphprotocol) May 22, 2023\n\nIntroduction to the Graph\u2019s Ecosystem\n\nThe Graph\u2019s ecosystem is comprised of four roles: developers, indexers, delegators, and curators. So, indexers stake $GRT, the native Graph token, and are rewarded for accurately indexing subgraphs through query and index rewards. Then, delegators stake $GRT to indexers in exchange for a share of the indexer\u2019s query fees. Curators indicate that a subgraph is of exceptional quality and should be indexed by the network.\n\nLet\u2019s look deeper at these protocol roles:\n\nDelegators: This group of participants stakes their GRT tokens with the indexers and gets a part of the indexer query fees. Delegators are subject to a 0.5% tax on each delegation. Indexers: They provide indexing and querying services as node operators. In return, indexers receive rewards and earn query fees. However, they have to stake 100,000 GRT tokens. This token will be slashed if the indexers carry out practices deemed harmful to the network. Curators: This group helps identify the subgraphs the Graph Explorer needs to index and receives 10% of the query fees. Data consumers, community members, and subgraph developers who want to signal their subgraphs can serve as curators. However, they have to pay a deposit tax of 1% to curate. They\u2019ll also receive lower fees if they curate subgraphs of low quality. In addition, they\u2019ll pay a tax of about 0.5\u20131% if a subgraph fails. Developers: Developers fall on the demand side of the ecosystem. They create subgraphs and publish them to the Graph Network. Furthermore, developers query live subgraphs with GraphQL to power their applications.\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Congrats to @graphprotocol on reaching 1000 subgraphs! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf10\n\nA major milestone that highlights the growth and potential of the decentralized ecosystem. With diverse data and interactions, the future of decentralized applications looks promising.Keep pushing the boundaries! \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udcbb pic.twitter.com/ltHwgVZe0c \u2014 \ud83d\udccaAndy S.\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80| TheGraphGermany\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@German_TheGraph) May 22, 2023\n\nHow to Stake GRT\n\nThere are different ways to earn GRT: Staking, lending, and yield farming. So, let\u2019s talk about staking. You can stake GRT on a centralized exchange like Binance. Here are the steps:\n\nLog in to your Binance account if you have one, or create one if you don\u2019t.\n\nGo to the \u201cFinance\u201d option and the \u201c Binance Earn \u201d option.\n\n\u201d option. Move to the \u201c Locked Staking \u201d option and click on the \u201c View more \u201d button.\n\n\u201d option and click on the \u201c \u201d button. Select GRT from the list displayed. Then, fix the duration and then click on \u201c Stake Now. \u201c\n\n\u201c Confirm details like duration and available amount.\n\nInput the amount you want to stake and click on \u201cConfirm purchase.\u201c\n\nWe\u2019re excited to announce our support for @graphprotocol $GRT staking! Earn up to 8% in yearly rewards, issued weekly with instant stake & unstake. Learn more here \ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/G4WkktJk1g * Rewards subject to change. Staking is not available to clients in US & CA. pic.twitter.com/eM6uRI0Bkt \u2014 Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) November 22, 2022\n\nWhat is the Graph Explorer?\n\nThe Graph Explorer is where you can view every subgraph that has been deployed to the Graph Network. The explorer allows you to see the subgraph\u2019s details, including its metadata and participant statistics. The curators can then select a subgraph and deposit GRT tokens in it so that it is signaled to the indexers. The Graph Explorer has tabs for:\n\nSubgraphs.\n\nIndexing.\n\nDelegating.\n\nCurating.\n\nFurthermore, the explorer allows all network users to view their user profiles. The Graph Explorer also displays the past and active results of each activity and details of the rewards earned.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Graph has unique potential as a querying service. However, you\u2019ll need to do your own research before investing. As of this article, GRT trades at $0.1215.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "title": "Does ChatGPT think Bitcoin will reach 35K? Tradecurve price rises 20% - TechCabal",
        "content": "Bitcoin has been one of the most talked-about topics recently because of its volatile nature. It has seen its fair share of ups and downs, making predicting its future difficult. In comparison, one project currently in Stage 2 of its presale has shown continuous price increases \u2013 Tradecurve (TCRV).\n\nIn this article, we will explore whether ChatGPT, a popular AI chatbot, thinks Bitcoin will reach 35k or not while also looking at what makes Tradecurve so attractive to investors.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nBitcoin (BTC) unable to maintain momentum\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized and anonymous cryptocurrency that allows for quick and straightforward transactions without banks or intermediaries. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has been on the crypto market throne since it is the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is trading hands at $26,796.71 with a market cap of $519B, which is a decrease of 0.38% in the past day alone. In the last month, Bitcoin has been struggling with a fall of 1.5% in its value during that period. ChatGPT cannot predict the future, but it has noted that Bitcoin is a volatile investment that may cause some concerns.\n\nExperts agree that if Bitcoin cannot climb beyond the $27,250 level, a further price decrease is in store. And if it does climb above it, Bitcoin may find a resistance level of $30,000. With these Bitcoin price predictions stating that a $35,000 valuation is not obtainable anytime soon, investors are looking at other projects to diversify their portfolios.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) presale continues capturing all attention\n\nBy creating a unique Ethereum-based hybrid trading exchange that does not require sign-up KYC checks, Tradecurve will become a significant power in the online trading market.\n\nIndividuals, no matter their location, will soon be able to trade stocks, commodities, forex, and cryptocurrency just by creating an account using their email, connecting a crypto wallet, and depositing on Tradecurve. This will be a significant turning point as traditional trading platforms such as Binance and eToro require KYC checks, effectively disabling privacy and anonymity for traders.\n\nTradecurve will also have a social trading feature, allowing users to copy what experienced traders are doing for a small subscription fee. Beginner traders may also find the metaverse trading academy very appealing as they can communicate with trading professionals.\n\nBuilding on the Ethereum blockchain will also have its perks, as individuals will control their keys and assets and enjoy lower trading fees thanks to decentralization. Tradecurve will employ its utility token, TCRV, as the backbone of this platform and features \u2013 providing holders with benefits such as subscription fee discounts, passive income via staking, and exclusive account rewards.\n\nIndividuals have found these benefits very appealing as millions of TCRV tokens have been sold already, and given its current presale price of just $0.012, now is a great time to purchase it.\n\nThis project is now in Stage 2 of its presale and has already seen a price increase of 20% from its starting price of $0.01. Experts forecast that more price hikes will come as they foresee a 50x increase by the time the presale finishes. Moreover, a 100x increase after its launch is not out of the question, as the TCRV token will get listed on a significant Tier-1 exchange such as Uniswap.\n\nAll signs are bullish for Tradecurve, and if we compare it to Huobi\u2019s ICO, which began in 2018 with a price of $1.52 and reached an ATH of $39.81 , a price surge can be expected for the TCRV token soon, so sign up for its presale below and obtain a 25% deposit bonus on each purchase.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve presale see links below:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official\n\nShare this article"

        "content": "The United Arab Emirates will soon be the home of the world's first ever bitcoin tower, which will be a hotel in the shape of a bitcoin. The 40-story tower will be built in Dubai, and the plan is set to be unveiled on May 24th.\n\nThe World's First Bitcoin Tower In Dubai\n\nA developer in Dubai recently unveiled plans to construct the world\u2019s first bitcoin (BTC) tower. With the unveiling scheduled for May 24th, the project aims to demonstrate the significance of digital assets and cryptocurrencies, coinciding with the upcoming COP28 meeting in Dubai.\n\n\n\nfinbold\n\nSalvatore Liggiero, the developer behind this venture, said the hotel will be the first of its kind, as per the Binance report. Designed in the style of bitcoin, the hotel developer plans to use cutting-edge technologies and sustainable materials, and it has a commitment to zero CO2 usage.\n\n\"It Gives You Back What You Paid\"\n\nIn a unique blend of traditional hospitality and cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin Tower isn\u2019t just a luxurious accommodation; it\u2019s a symbol of the digital age, illustrating cryptocurrencies\u2019 increasing importance and influence in our everyday lives. The hotel chain\u2019s innovative approach transforms the hotel experience by offering guests exclusive NFTs (non-fungible tokens) as rewards. These tokens prove authenticity and ownership in the digital realm, granting holders exclusive privileges.\n\nThis model introduces a new facet to the hospitality industry: the rental price isn\u2019t just a payment; it\u2019s an investment. It is treated as staking cryptocurrency, producing an annual percentage yield (APY) that guests can claim.\n\nIn the words of developer Salvatore Leggiero, it\u2019s \u201cthe first hotel that gives you back the money you paid, plus interest,\u201d as per various media reports.\n\nNot only does this project aim to educate the general public about cryptocurrencies, but it also encourages participation. Leggiero invites artists, architects, creatives, and crypto enthusiasts to submit their works.\n\nshutterstock\n\nAlso Read: Here Are The Beautiful Glimpses Of World's First Bitcoin City\n\nThese creations will form an exclusive NFT collection dedicated to the Bitcoin Tower\u2019s design or its internal spaces, manifesting an asset of tremendous tangible value in the digital space.\n\nA Homage To The World's First Cryptocurrency\n\nThe architectural work hopes to serve as homage to the first cryptocurrency and to encapsulate the principles laid down by its enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n\n\nThe bitcoin tower\u2019s developer also wants to demonstrate Dubai\u2019s goal to bridge the gap between digital and physical assets. To foster a collaborative environment, Leggiero encourages individuals from diverse backgrounds to participate in this endeavour, recognising the immense value that their collective expertise can bring to the project.\n\nAlso Read: Death Of One Of The World's Richest Arabs Leaves Behind Messy Inheritance In Dubai\n\nFor the latest and more interesting financial news, keep reading Indiatimes Worth.

        "content": "Exclusive\n\nIllegal crypto ATMs are still operating in corner shops around the country despite a crackdown by the financial watchdog, the i has found.\n\nLawyers have warned that these ATMs are a risk to unwitting customers, who may not know they are illegal and could struggle to get cash back if the transaction were to go wrong.\n\nShopkeepers who have the machines on their premises may also be providing a \u201cperilously simple\u201d way for criminals to money launder, through a technique known as \u201csmurfing\u201d, the lawyers warn.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has previously warned operators of crypto ATMs in the UK to shut their machines down or face enforcement action including potential criminal charges.\n\nOver the past year it says it has visited sites in east London, Leeds, Exeter, Nottingham and Sheffield as part of its crackdown.\n\nBut maps circulating online still show more than a dozen of the ATMs operating in London, Manchester and Birmingham.\n\ni visited two of the machines in bustling corner shops in inner London within the past week.\n\nThe ATMs allow customers to move bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on to a \u201cdigital wallet\u201d using cash.\n\nThe FCA has said that none of the cryptoasset firms registered with it have been approved to offer crypto ATM services, meaning that any of them operating in the UK are doing so illegally and people should not be using them.\n\nAkber Datoo, founder of D2 Legal Technology, told i that the customers using the machines may not be \u201caware\u201d of the risk involved.\n\nA crypto ATM within a store in London, visited by i\n\nMr Datoo, who also sits on the Law Society\u2019s Technology and Law Committee added: \u201cThese are not regular ATMs, despite appearances. What if something were to go wrong \u2013 if money were not returned, or the cryptocurrency did not transfer to your wallet? The reality is that there is less by way of consumer protection, compared with a regular ATM\u201d.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, they may be used for illegal purposes. Through \u2018smurfing\u2019 \u2013 whereby large amounts of money are split into micro transactions \u2013 it can become perilously simple to effect money laundering through these Crypto ATMs.\u201d\n\nHe explained that shopkeepers may be enticed to house the machines because they could lead to an increase in footfall in their shops.\n\n\u201cThere is an association with cryptocurrencies and getting rich quick, which may be attractive to certain people that may actually need the consumer protection\u201d, he said.\n\nWhat is bitcoin? Bitcoin is a type of digital \u201ccurrency\u201d, but unlike other currencies, such as the pound and the dollar, it does not rely on a government or central bank to maintain it.\n\n\n\nIt is the most well-known cryptocurrency and hit headlines a few years ago as people started to use it as an investment vehicle. One bitcoin went from being worth less than a penny in 2010 to being worth around \u00a348,000 in 2021. The value has fallen since, but still sits above \u00a320,000. People can invest in bitcoin via exchanges or brokers \u2013 with the likes of EToro being an example of a regulated firm \u2013 but the currency has also been the focus of many scams in the past few years, where fraudsters claim to be offering investment opportunities that turn out to be fake.\n\nThe machines seen by i were prominently disaplyed, with clear instructions on how to obtain cryptocurrency using the machine.\n\nOne shop, just a few minutes walk from a Zone One London tube station had adverts outside, flagging that customers could purchase bitcoin in the store.\n\nAn advert telling customers they can buy bitcoin inside the store\n\nThe FCA has said it is continuing to inspect and take action against those hosting unregistered crypto ATMs in the UK, and is liaising with the Association of Convenience Stores (ACS).\n\nIt said that it regularly repeats warnings that that cryptoassets are unregulated and high risk, which means people are very unlikely to have any protection if things go wrong.\n\nACS chief executive James Lowman said: \u201cWe are working with the FCA on ensuring that retailers understand the regulations surrounding unregistered cryptocurrency ATMs. There are very few of these operating in the UK, but it is important that both consumers and retailers appreciate the risks associated with this technology.\u201d\n\nOne of the machines that i was able to find said it was operated by Big Sea Coins, which claims on its website it operates at 11 locations in the UK.\n\nThe organisation is on an FCA list of unregistered cryptoasset businesses."
