        "title": "Unveiling Bitcoin\u2019s Water Consumption with Alex de Vries - greenpeace.org",
        "content": "Unveiling Bitcoin\u2019s Water Consumption with Alex de Vries\n\nAlex de Vries, the researcher behind a groundbreaking report that exposes Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption, spoke with Greenpeace USA to discuss the findings of this hidden ecological cost of Bitcoin mining. De Vries\u2019s research highlights substantial water usage associated with Bitcoin mining. The water consumption of U.S. Bitcoin miners alone could be on par with the average annual water consumption of approximately 300,000 U.S. households, equivalent to that of a city like Washington, DC.\n\nWith climate disasters plaguing the planet, including drought and scarcity of clean drinking water, consuming water at this scale for the \u201cnumber-guessing game\u201d that powers the Bitcoin network puts additional strain on a precious resource. De Vries\u2019s research indicates that Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption will soon rival that of the entire traditional financial system. Paired with its contribution to global carbon emissions, Bitcoin as it functions today threatens our progress on addressing the climate crisis and averting its worst consequences.\n\nThis report should prompt additional discussion on how Bitcoin is impacting the climate and endangering access to water. As evidence mounts of the Bitcoin mining industry\u2019s current and potential future role in exacerbating the climate crisis, it is imperative for users of Bitcoin, industry leaders, policymakers, financial institutions, and the global community to develop a solution to the technology\u2019s carbon emissions and resource consumption problem. Our campaign is urging the financial institutions driving Bitcoin\u2019s value growth to acknowledge the impacts of their direct investments in dirty mining and accept responsibility in the development and implementation of solutions.\n\nGreenpeace USA: What led you to research Bitcoin\u2019s water footprint?\n\nAlex de Vries: This dimension of Bitcoin mining has been under examined for years, but as climate change is worsening and water scarcity is becoming an increasingly pressing issue around the world, it also becomes more important to be aware of how much water is used by Bitcoin. Given the work I have previously done with regard to the electricity consumption of Bitcoin mining it\u2019s subsequently only a small step to the water footprint related to electricity consumption.\n\nGreenpeace USA: How did you conduct your research?\n\nAlex de Vries: There is a lot of data available on where miners are using electricity and how much electricity they may be using. These inputs were previously used to determine the carbon footprint of Bitcoin mining. The methodologies for doing so are well established. We combine the data on miner locations and their power demand with the carbon intensity of the electricity they are consuming.\n\nTo get to the water footprint of Bitcoin mining, we only have to replace the carbon intensity of electricity with the respective water intensity. It\u2019s worth noting miners also require water for onsite cooling, which has to be added on top of the water from electricity generation. For this part I looked into how regular large scale data centers are performing in areas where miners are located. The latter analysis was only done for the US, where I found that direct water consumption represents 10-20 percent of the total water footprint of Bitcoin mining.\n\nGreenpeace USA: How and why does Bitcoin use so much water?\n\nAlex de Vries: First of all we have to realize that there are millions of Bitcoin mining devices around the world generating 500 quintillion random numbers in what is effectively a massive game of \u201cguess the number\u201d every single second of the day. Only once every 10 minutes one participant guesses correctly and then gets to create the next block for the blockchain, which includes a reward of 6.25 Bitcoins. This process requires vast quantities of electricity, currently more than half a percent of our global electricity consumption is related to Bitcoin mining.\n\nGiven that we also require water for cooling purposes in thermoelectric power generation, plus the fact that water evaporates from the hydroelectric reservoirs, a lot of water is consumed to satisfy the power demand of miners. Of course, mining devices are operating 24/7 and generating a lot of heat in the process, so cooling systems are also required to keep the devices at optimal temperatures. As mentioned before, this onsite cooling is only a limited part of the total water footprint, which is also the case for regular data centers.\n\nGreenpeace USA: What is the scale of Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption?\n\nAlex de Vries: In total it can be estimated that Bitcoin consumed more than 1600 gigaliters (GL) of water in 2021 and is likely consuming more than 2200 GL of water in 2023. To put this into perspective; another recent study quantified that the traditional financial system (i.e., bank notes + bank branches + ATMs + cashless transactions) combined consumes close to 1800 GL of water per year. Bitcoin\u2019s total water footprint therefore could exceed that of the entire traditional financial system.\n\nWe also have to realize that while the traditional financial system handles over 2 trillion cashless transactions per year, Bitcoin is stuck at just 100 million transactions a year. The network is capped at handling a handful of transactions per second; a single block simply cannot fit more data. That means that while an average cashless transaction such as a credit card swipe will only consume about 2.6 milliliters of water, the average per Bitcoin transaction exceeds 16,000 liters. That may be enough water to fill a backyard swimming pool and it\u2019s roughly 6.2 million times more than what we need for a typical cashless transaction.\n\nGreenpeace USA: How much water is used by Bitcoin mining operations in the U.S.? How does this compare to other countries?\n\nAlex de Vries: Bitcoin miners in the US currently consume up to 120 GL of fresh water per year. This is enough to supply 300,000 households. However, Bitcoin miners in the US are not responsible for the largest share of the worldwide network\u2019s water footprint. Kazakhstan is actually the biggest contributor, with miners in the country consuming almost 1,000 GL per year. Even though there are less miners in Kazakhstan than in the US, geographical (climate) conditions significantly increase the local water consumption. This could be a serious cause for concern, as the country is already facing an expected shortfall of about 75 GL of water by the year 2030.\n\nGreenpeace USA: What are the major takeaways you would want readers to have from your new research article about Bitcoin\u2019s water footprint?\n\nAlex de Vries: I\u2019m firstly trying to make people aware of this dimension of Bitcoin mining. I am assuming readers will find that the water footprint of the network is larger than they could have ever imagined. I also hope readers will realize that simply putting more renewables in the Bitcoin network is not a way to make this problem go away. In fact, as renewables include hydroelectric power (the power source with the largest water consumption per kWh generated), this would only make the water footprint worse.\n\nGreenpeace USA: What could be done to reduce Bitcoin\u2019s water footprint?\n\nAlex de Vries: You could advocate for using wind and solar power specifically to power these operations, while also trying to lower direct water consumption through, for example, immersion cooling. At the same time, using our limited wind and solar supply for Bitcoin mining just means we\u2019ll have to use other power sources to power something else somewhere else. There is a big opportunity cost here if we keep using limited resources for the sole purpose of making useless computations in Bitcoin mining. All of the output (nothing more than random numbers in a massive guessing game) is immediately discarded.\n\nThe best solution would therefore be to get rid of this energy-intensive process altogether, which was already shown to be possible by the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum. Last year September (2022) Ethereum cut their total power demand by replacing their own mining mechanism with a more sustainable alternative. There is no technical reason why this would not be possible in Bitcoin. Almost all of the electricity consumption, water consumption, carbon emissions and electronic waste generation would simply disappear overnight. There is no better solution than this.\n\nTo read the full report click here."

        "content": "Bitcoin is building on its upward momentum, with the flagship cryptocurrency topping $44,000 for the first time since April 2022 on Tuesday.\n\nThe price of bitcoin was last higher by more than 4% to $43,794.99, according to Coin Metrics, extending gains from the previous day, as the drumbeat for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. grew louder. At one point, the coin traded as high as $44,903.45, its highest level since Apr. 7, 2022.\n\nTuesday's gains bring bitcoin up more than 160% for the year. Ether was higher by 1.6% on the day at $2,263.76. It's up 88% for 2023.\n\nBitcoin has been reaching new highs more frequently over the past several weeks. It broke through $40,000 over the weekend for the first time since April 2022, after beginning November around the $34,000 level and climbing incrementally to new year-to-date highs in between."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Prices Are Rising at the End of 2023 - Money",
        "content": "Bitcoin is back. The crypto industry\u2019s biggest asset responded to a dismal 2022 with a sustained climb upward this year. In the last few months of 2023, that slow crawl has turned into a cannon shot.\n\nBitcoin prices rose from $16,625 in January up to around $30,000 at the end of October \u2014 onward all the way to over $42,000 in early December. That\u2019s a year-to-date increase of over 150%, including an increase of around 21% over the past month. Perhaps no one should be surprised by the surge: After all, we\u2019re in the middle of a time when the most famous cryptocurrency historically performs the strongest.\n\nBitcoin's price has often seen significant spikes in the fourth quarter of the year, suggesting a seasonal trend. In 2016, for example, bitcoin gained 63% from the beginning of October to the end of December. In 2017, it gained 267% in that same time frame. In fact, between 2016 and 2021, the crypto has gained an average of 25% in October, 8% in November and 11% in December, according to data by investing research company Bespoke Investing Group.\n\nThis gives a lot of hope for investors that bitcoin can add onto its recent surge. But no one can accurately predict where volatile investments like crypto are headed at any given time, and some experts question whether there's any truth to the theory that bitcoin prices often get a bump toward the end of the year.\n\nDo bitcoin prices rise at the end of the year?\n\nThe numbers indicate that the fourth quarter has been historically favorable for bitcoin prices. But experts have not come to a consensus on why or even if bitcoin prices often surge in the fall.\n\nA popular theory is that crypto buyers, just like stock investors, are apt to trade heavily toward the end of the calendar year. Bitwise Asset Management\u2019s chief investment officer, Matthew Hougan, previously told Money that while investors are looking to strategize their portfolios for the year\u2019s end, lots of money has tended to end up in crypto allocations.\n\nOthers say it\u2019s just too early to draw any conclusions about bitcoin pricing trends. Omid Malekan, crypto expert and adjunct professor at Columbia University's Business School, tells Money that he\u2019s \u201cnot certain if bitcoin has a strong seasonal trend or if it's coincidental.\u201d\n\nCrypto may be over a decade old, but it\u2019s still infantile compared to other assets like stocks or bonds. This lack of sufficient data, Malekan says, makes it difficult to assess the validity of any crypto trends.\n\nMalekan says bitcoin is defined by \u201ceras\u201d perhaps more so than seasonal trends. \u201cThe last bull market and crash were driven by central bank liquidity and fears about inflation and the resulting monetary tightening,\u201d he says. These eras are not seasonal trends that hold up over time, but rather shorter-lived events driven by investor behavior.\n\nDo bitcoin prices and stocks rise and fall together?\n\nBut wait, don\u2019t stocks often rise in the fourth quarter as well? That\u2019s true. As it turns out, bitcoin prices and stocks seem to be more linked than you might expect. And this relationship could be what gives some credence to the idea of bitcoin price seasonality.\n\nIn February, researchers at Georgetown University discovered that a correlation between cryptocurrency prices and the stock market continues to grow stronger. Specifically, they find that price movements of bitcoin and the S&P 500 Index are correlated, and continue to become more so. They said that the linkage \u201cmay reflect the fact that the two markets are becoming more connected, as institutional investors increasingly enter the crypto world.\u201d\n\nWhile the reasons why the two investments follow the same price patterns aren't totally understood yet, it would make sense that crypto is prone to the same kind of selloffs that happen in the stock market.\n\nIf this is true, then there is reason to believe that bitcoin prices tend to rise at the end of the year at least partly because stocks also frequently rise at the end of the year. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has posted an average gain of 4.2% in the last quarter of the year. That's twice as good as the next best-performing first quarter, which averages a return of 2.1%. And just like how September is typically a bad month for bitcoin prices, it is also historically one of the worst months for stock performance.\n\nWhere are bitcoin prices heading now?\n\nIf the theory that bitcoin prices rise at the end of the year holds true, the crypto could continue its recent hot run. However, as the saying goes: Past performance is not indicative of future results.\n\nLast year, the coin dropped by 12.3% over the course of the fourth quarter. Of course, bitcoin\u2019s 2022 was marked by losses throughout the entirety of the year, with the crypto losing 66% over 12 months. In retrospect, banking on a strong end of the year in 2022 would have proved foolish. Ultimately, for what it's worth the October-December period in 2022 was bitcoin's second-worst quarter in the year.\n\nWith wind behind bitcoin's sails this year, though, as well as building excitement over likely upcoming changes in crypto investing options, many experts have voiced bullish predictions for the near term.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one step closer to a spot bitcoin ETF, and investors are optimistic that an approval could happen fairly soon,\u201d says Anthony Georgiades, general partner at investing fund Innovation Capital. \u201cThere\u2019s also much anticipation about the next bitcoin halving, which typically serves as a catalyst for bull markets.\u201d\n\nA bitcoin ETF is an investment fund made up of bitcoin or bitcoin-related companies. Right now, bitcoin ETFs only consist of futures contracts, instead of the cryptocurrency itself. Investing companies Fidelity and BlackRock are both waiting for approval for their spot bitcoin ETFs, which would be the first ETFs to contain bitcoin itself. Bitcoin halving, meanwhile, is a process in which the rate at which coins are released is cut in half; it happens every four years, and the next halving is expected in spring of 2024.\n\nOthers say that the potential for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in 2024 is also driving optimism. Zachary Townsend, CEO of crypto company Meanwhile, says \u201cthe cost of servicing the existing and new debt will simply be too high\" for the Fed to avoid cutting its rates.\n\nOne consequence of this, Townsend says, is \"debasement of the currency,\" or a drop in value of the U.S. dollar. \"It\u2019s in these kinds of environments in particular, when fiat currency is getting debased, that bitcoin performs best.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind, though, that these cuts might be further off than previously anticipated. The Fed is unlikely to follow through with the December rate hike it threatened previously; but even without one final hike, experts still largely foresee a long pause. A majority of opinions seem to be that the first rate cut will not come until the second half of next year. So, this bullish catalyst might be a ways off.\n\nNewsletter Make smarter money decisions in just a few minutes every day Subscribe to Daily Money to get more of the latest personal finance news, stories, and analysis delivered everyday to your inbox.

        "content": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nNew York CNN \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s already been a heck of a week for alternative assets, as gold and bitcoin surge. But analysts are cautioning investors to be wary of rushing in. All that glitters, after all, isn\u2019t gold.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: The price of bitcoin surged past $44,000 early on Wednesday. It hasn\u2019t been close to this level since spring 2022. That\u2019s when Terra \u2014 a popular \u201cstablecoin\u201d that was meant to retain a $1 price point \u2014 lost its peg, and when the connected Luna cryptocurrency dropped 99% in a matter of days, bringing down most of the crypto market.\n\nThe recent swell in crypto is a result of investor optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2024 and that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund, making it easier for mainstream investors to get involved. The SEC faces a January 10 deadline to approve the application.\n\nGold prices, meanwhile, rose to a never-before-seen high of $2,135.40 on Monday as investors price in larger rate cuts by the Fed. Prices fell on Tuesday, but bullion\u2019s value remains elevated.\n\nCrypto and precious metal advocates were gung-ho on Tuesday, claiming that this could be the dawn of a new era, a resurgence in alternative assets.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is so back,\u201d Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini, posted on X. \u201cBitcoin at 42k is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything.\u201d\n\nJohn Reade, a market strategist at the World Gold Council, an association of gold producers, told CNN that, with investors predicting several rate cuts over the next year, gold prices could \u201cquite possibly\u201d shoot above Monday\u2019s record high.\n\nBut a few days does not a sea change make. Advocates may be getting a bit ahead of themselves.\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\nNo interest paid on gold: Yes, gold technically hit an all-time high this week, but there\u2019s some context that needs to come with that statement.\n\nGold doesn\u2019t pay any interest, so \u201calthough we have hit all time highs in nominal terms, we are over 20% below the inflation-adjusted peak seen in 1980,\u201d wrote Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank in a note Tuesday.\n\nSo while gold may seem like a great way to hedge inflation, \u201cit only keeps pace with inflation if you buy it at the correct time,\u201d said Reid. \u201cIn reality, it trails traditional assets over almost all medium- to long-term time periods.\u201d\n\nA recent study by Deutsche Bank found that since 1800, gold has had an inflation-adjusted return of 0.32% a year. That\u2019s compared to a 3.07% return on Treasuries and a 6.83% return on equities.\n\n\u201cIt struggles on a competitive basis,\u201d said Reid. \u201cYou can be a long-run inflationist but still be a bit underwhelmed by Gold as an investment.\u201d\n\nCrypto uncertainty: Despite the buzz around the expected green light of a spot bitcoin ETF in January, there\u2019s no guarantee that the SEC will give its nod of approval. And even if it does, there\u2019s no guarantee it will send digital currencies soaring.\n\nWhile bitcoin has not approached its all-time record of near $69,000, set in November 2021, much of the price inflation comes from investors front-running the SEC\u2019s likely approval, said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of the crypto lender Nexo. That begs the question of whether this is a \u201cbuy-the-rumor, sell-the-news event\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s a danger that investors will \u201crush for the exit when it happens,\u201d he said, similar to when the first ETF for bitcoin futures was approved in the fall of 2021 and prices quickly plunged 87%.\n\nTrenchev also pointed out that bitcoin often goes \u201cinto reverse\u201d after it breaks key thresholds. \u201cTwo weeks after bitcoin pierced $40,000 for the first time during the last bull market in 2021 it sunk below $30,000,\u201d he said.\n\nA cautious Fed: The Fed is probably done hiking interest rates to fight elevated inflation, at least for this cycle. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessarily cutting them anytime soon.\n\nA number of Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, have indicated in recent weeks that it\u2019s still too early to debate rate cuts. Instead, policymakers will focus on whether the current fund rate is sufficiently restrictive.\n\n\u201cIt would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease. We are prepared to tighten policy further if it becomes appropriate to do so,\u201d said Powell during a discussion at Spelman College last week.\n\nOther Fed officials have backed that stance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not thinking about rate cuts at all right now. I\u2019m thinking about whether we have enough tightening in the system and are sufficiently restrictive to restore price stability,\u201d said Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly in an interview last week. \u201cDiscussion about interest rate cuts is not particularly helpful at the moment. We should continue to focus on lowering inflation.\u201d\n\nCOP out?\n\nPeople walk through the COP28 U.N. Climate Summit, Monday, Dec. 4, 2023, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Peter Dejong/AP\n\nCOP28, the annual international climate summit convened by the United Nations in Dubai, is well underway, and it appears that big energy companies are making sure their voices are heard as pressure builds for the phasing down, or even out, of fossil fuels.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: More than 2,400 people connected to the fossil fuel industry registered to attend the event, nearly four times the number that signed up for last year\u2019s climate gathering, according to an analysis published Tuesday.\n\nFossil fuel employees and representatives will outnumber every country\u2019s delegation except for the United Arab Emirates, the host of COP28, and Brazil, according to the report from a coalition of corporate watchdog and climate advocacy groups, including Global Witness.\n\nSultan Al Jaber, the oil executive who is leading the climate summit, meanwhile, shocked crowds when he said ahead of the meeting that there is \u201cno science\u201d that says phasing out fossil fuels is necessary to keep global warming under a critical threshold. Al Jaber says that his comments were misinterpreted.\n\n\u201cThe real outcome of COP28 is that the major crude oil and natural gas producers intend to control carbon capture, green hydrogen production, and alternative energy generation,\u201d said Louis Navellier of Navellier & Associates in a note on Tuesday. \u201cEssentially,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe pace of the green transition will be controlled by major energy producers.\u201d\n\nNaming names: That\u2019s not to say energy companies were totally in the clear. John Kerry, the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, was critical of energy companies and even singled out Chevron after the company opted out of a pledge to reduce methane emissions.\n\n\u201cWe have no real evidence that [Chevron] and a lot of others are doing what every company needs to do,\u201d he said at the Bloomberg Green summit on Tuesday.\n\nAl Gore was also critical of the fossil fuel industry and called out Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods at the summit. \u201cHe should not be taken seriously. He\u2019s protecting his profits and placing them in a higher priority than the survival of the human civilization,\u201d he said of Woods.\n\nStill, said Navellier, \u201cthe bottom line is green energy is very expensive and the fossil fuel industry will make just enough green energy to appease government regulators, but fossil fuels will persist for the rest of our lifetimes.\u201d\n\nAluminum tariffs have cost the US beer industry $2.2 billion\n\nNew research by the aptly-named Beer Institute, a beer industry advocacy group, found that aluminum tariffs have cost the US beverage industry nearly $2.2 billion over the last six years.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump instituted a 10% tax on aluminum imports from most countries in 2018 under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act.\n\nMore than 74% of all beer produced in the United States is packaged in aluminum cans and bottles, and aluminum is the single most significant input cost in American beer manufacturing, according to the Beer Institute.\n\n\u201cBrewers and countless hardworking Americans in industries that depend on aluminum have been taking it on the chin for far too long,\u201d said Brian Crawford, president and CEO of the Beer Institute, in a statement. \u201cThe reality is that [these] tariffs hurt far more than they help, and they hurt consumers who are already feeling the effects of inflation at the register.\u201d\n\nThere are more than 6,600 breweries in the United States. The industry supports about 2.4 million jobs and contributes $409 billion annually to the US economy.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated bitcoin\u2019s record. It was near $69,000."

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day\n\nWhat we're watching\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nEconomic data releases and earnings\n\nYou may have heard: Bitcoin is back. The price of the biggest cryptocurrency has surged past $42,000 and is up more than 150% this year.\n\nWith the price recovery, we\u2019ve seen the reemergence of a certain kind of financial media character: the shill, the opportunist, the tout, the pumper.\n\nThey were everywhere when bitcoin was climbing to record highs in 2021. When Americans were getting government checks, sitting at home, and looking to strike it rich, crypto seemed like a no-brainer, driven in no small part by FOMO \u2014 and these hype men saying it was the future of finance.\n\nThe voices got quieter when the price crashed from above $60,000 to below $20,000, although the faithful insisted this was part of bitcoin\u2019s \u201ctypical cycle.\u201d That quiet turned to embarrassment for some with the collapse of the Terra stablecoin, the implosion of FTX (with whom many had financial relationships), and the arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nBut another characteristic of some of this cohort is their lack of shame. So even as all of those events were unfolding, it wasn\u2019t difficult to find them on Twitter, hewing fast to their stated belief that bitcoin was the answer \u2014 to getting rich, to finance, to whatever.\n\nWill retail investors get caught up in FOMO once again? Signs point to yes. The first leg of the latest rally seems to have been driven in part by predictions (once again) for institutional investment in crypto, tied in part to the anticipation of SEC approval for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWith price action comes renewed retail interest. Robinhood just reported that November crypto trading volumes surged by 75% compared to October. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi that price appreciation begets media interest begets retail investment:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cYou are starting to see retail investors wake up to certain segments of the rally. What tends to happen is, we've seen in the past as the price of bitcoin approaches all-time highs, the media coverage and intensity increases. And I think that plays a role as well. If people are just hearing more about crypto around them, they tend to become more interested, and you start to see that reflected in trading activity, at least in the past.\u201d\n\nAll of this is not to say that bitcoin won\u2019t keep going up, or that it couldn't indeed play some role in the future of finance. But I\u2019ve been at this long enough to be suspicious when a bet on an asset starts to sound like a religious belief \u2014 especially when the belief is intertwined with profit and depends on you also shelling out cash.\n\nThere are rational voices in the crypto universe who don\u2019t seem to just be relying on the greater fool theory. One of them is Devin Ryan, who covers the fintech industry for Citizens JMP Securities. He\u2019s looking at the sheer scale of the ETF industry, and the giant asset managers like BlackRock who are sure to allocate to their Bitcoin ETF if it is indeed approved.\n\n\u201cPeople are getting a bit ahead of the ETFs,\u201d Ryan told Yahoo Finance Live. But just \"a very small fraction\" of asset managers' trillions would in fact be enormous. Just think of all the private clients allocating a few million here, a few there.\n\n\"That could be hundreds of billions of market cap expansion,\" Ryan said.\n\nIt may not be the moon, but it's something.\n\nmorning brief image\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

For all the angst in the run-up to this, though, the industry has taken it in stride. Anyway, CZ's replacement , Richard Teng, just had his first big public interview, and it was not a smooth debut , according to CoinDesk's Helene Braun. He came across as evasive. The company never says where it's based, and Teng was opaque about that and other issues. The question is whether this matters. Maybe traders don't care if the world's biggest crypto exchange is evasive?"

The deadline for the SEC to rule on the proposed Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) is Jan. 10.\n\nThe SEC allowed bitcoin futures ETFs to start trading in October 2021. Wood said during a Wednesday webinar those approvals were \u201cinteresting\u201d given the counterparty risk for those funds \u2014 compared to a spot product backed by bitcoin held in cold storage. Most issuers seeking to launch bitcoin ETFs have named Coinbase as custodian of the funds\u2019 BTC.\n\nGrayscale Investments notched a court victory against the SEC in August. Judges ruled that the commission denying the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) to an ETF, but allowing futures-based funds, was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s all coming together, and if you look at our appreciation expectations for bitcoin, the biggest part of the appreciation during the next five to 10 years we think will come from institutional,\u201d Wood added.\n\nThe executive has said the price of one bitcoin could hit $1 million or more in the long term.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts put the odds of spot bitcoin ETF approval, by Jan. 10, at 90%.\n\nRead more: Industry watchers pin down possible bitcoin ETF approval dates\n\nApproval would be a change in stance for a securities regulator that has blocked dozens of spot bitcoin ETF proposals over the last decade.\n\n\n\nBut 21Shares President Ophelia Snyder reiterated previous comments Wednesday that there have been \u201cpattern breaks\u201d in recent months as issuers look to get these funds approved.\n\n\u201cIf everything goes the way it always goes, you\u2019re going to end up with the same result,\u201d she said on the webinar alongside Wood. \u201cI think the fact we\u2019re seeing very material differences in this round of the spot process versus prior rounds is a very promising indication of a different outcome.\u201d\n\nThe changes include issuers continuously updating their Bitcoin ETF filings.

BlackRock and Bitwise, for example, updated their S-1 forms Monday.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nAmong the additions in BlackRock\u2019s amendment was the language around the firm raising $100,000 of seed capital for the fund. Such capital is used to fund creation units that allow shares to be offered and traded in the open market.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] meaningful because it shows they are doing everything needed to launch,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart told Blockworks. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it means much more than that.\u201d\n\nOther amendments have been more technical, including disclosure language around electricity usage of bitcoin mining or the impact of a digital asset being deemed a security in the future.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe latest bitcoin ETF filing from Ark and 21Shares came in April, which was a couple months before BlackRock entered the picture \u2014 a move that spurred Fidelity, Invesco and a range of others to re-up their own bitcoin ETF efforts.\n\n\u201cWe do think while we\u2019re first in line that a number of the firms will be approved at the same time,\u201d Wood said. \u201cDepending on exactly how they filed, it could be that more than a half dozen are approved in the first go.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Bitcoin's bounceback d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - Cryptocurrencies - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe crypto bulls are back again. Bitcoin surged to $42,000 on Monday, its highest in nearly 20 months, marking a dramatic 150 per cent rise so far this year. After losing more than 60 per cent of its value in 2022, its climb back has sparked yet another wave of euphoric calls: industry veterans now project the token will breach $100,000 by the end of 2024, and at least $750,000 by 2026. Competitors including ethereum, dogecoin, solana and cardano are all up by double-digit percentages too.\n\nAs with any instrument, the investment case for crypto hinges on finding a convincing narrative. But unlike other assets, bitcoin has no intrinsic value, nor is it backed by anything. Some may argue that gold is not much different. Yet the glossy metal has been trusted as an effective store of wealth for millennia, and has been shown to offer some protection in down markets and times of high uncertainty \u2014 living up to its status as a hedge.\n\nThe same cannot be said for bitcoin. Its most consistent facet is its inconsistency. What the cryptocurrency ultimately offers, then, is a chance to speculate on the market\u2019s sentiment towards itself. And here the current pro-bitcoin sales pitch from its evangelists appears to be three-fold.\n\nFirst, they argue, a \u201crisk-on\u201d mood has returned to financial markets. In recent weeks, investors have become increasingly convinced that the US Federal Reserve has reached the end of its interest rate-raising cycle, and that cuts will happen sooner than it is signalling. With ample liquidity, and rate expectations lower, punting for something more speculative seems appealing. And rising bitcoin prices tend to generate a buying frenzy, which reinforces itself \u2014 until it inevitably pops.\n\nThe bulls are, however, also claiming that this time it is more than just hype. The second part of their pitch is that the closure of the most high-profile criminal cases that have hung over the crypto-market for the past year is akin to a cleansing moment. Last month the US successfully prosecuted Sam Bankman-Fried, former chief executive of FTX, for fraud, while Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, pleaded guilty to charges related to money laundering and sanctions breaches.\n\nThird, crypto optimists expect signs of a possible US regulatory approval for spot bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, among others, to drive a wave of crypto fund products backed by mainstream asset managers. Wider institutional adoption by serious players, they claim, gives cryptocurrency credibility.\n\nBut the buy-and-hold case is full of holes. Crypto\u2019s brushes with the law are far from over. In the nascent industry, the authorities are still cautiously calibrating regulations and hearing legal cases. Gary Gensler, chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, recently said the sector was rife with \u201cfraud, scams, bankruptcies and money laundering\u201d.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETF applications, if approved, may attract more investors who seek crypto exposure yet are fearful of theft and lost coins in digital wallets and exchanges. But they do not protect investors from crypto\u2019s volatility. As it is, Grayscale\u2019s private trusts tracking cryptocurrencies are trading at absurd multiples of their underlying value. For mainstream asset managers, ETFs are also just another way to collect fees from investors seeking crypto exposure, not necessarily a backing of the asset class itself.\n\nWhat remains of the bull case, then, is the flimsy argument that there appears to be some appetite for speculation, and that bitcoin is a speculative asset. This is basically the \u201cgreater fool theory\u201d playbook for investors: all you need to profit from an investment is to find someone silly enough to buy the asset at an even higher price. That will last, until it doesn\u2019t. Bitcoin has collapsed before; it will surely do so again.\n\nLetter in response to this editorial:\n\nBitcoin loses its lustre next to gold bullion / From Alex J Pollock, Senior Fellow, Mises Institute, Lake Forest, IL, US"

        "content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon gestures as he speaks during the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee oversight hearing on Wall Street firms, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 6, 2023.\n\n\"If I was the government, I'd close it down,\" he added.\n\n\"I've always been deeply opposed to crypto, bitcoin, etc.,\" the head of the largest U.S. bank by assets said under questioning from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. \"The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers \u2026 money laundering, tax avoidance.\"\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon lashed out at bitcoin and its peers, suggesting in remarks Wednesday on Capitol Hill that cryptocurrencies should be banned.\n\nThe remarks are the latest broadside from Dimon against cryptocurrencies, though his bank is heavily involved in blockchain, the enabling technology for the $1.6 trillion industry.\n\nIn previous statements, Dimon has called bitcoin \"a hyped-up fraud,\" a comment he later walked back. He had also likened it to a \"pet rock.\"\n\nUnder further questioning from Warren, Dimon and several other CEOs of large banks brought before the committee as part of a routine hearing on the industry, agreed that crypto companies should face the same anti-money-laundering regulations as the major financial institutions.\n\nThe topic marked a rare note of unity between the banking leaders and Warren, usually a harsh critic of the industry.\n\n\"When it comes to banking policy, I am not usually holding hands with the CEOs of multibillion-dollar banks, but this is a matter of national security. Terrorists, drug traffickers and rogue nations should be barred from using crypto for their dangerous activities. It is time for Congress to act,\" Warren said.\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

        "content": "Nearly $100 million in bitcoin short positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours on centralized crypto exchanges, according to Coinglass data.\n\nThe bitcoin market experienced increased volatility over the past day, with the price fluctuating around the $44,000 mark. This price action caused the wipeout of approximately $122 million in bitcoin positions, with $96 million being shorts.\n\nAccording to The Block\u2019s Data Dashboard, over $260 million has so far been liquidated in short BTC -4.86% liquidations in the initial five days of December.\n\nBitfinex analysts say while bitcoin remains volatile, they remain bullish for 2024. The analysts highlighted two factors that could be fueling the recent rally: the upcoming bitcoin halving in April 2024 and the potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\n\"While some market participants are eyeing $100,000 and some hoping for higher, we believe the bitcoin price will reach between $60,000 and $75,000 by the end of next year. This should be an easily attainable range considering the bottom of the trading range this year was formed around $16,000,\" Bitfinex analysts said in a note shared with The Block.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nCombined cryptocurrency market short liquidations\n\nDecember has seen a significant increase in the amount of short liquidations across the entire cryptocurrency market.

        "content": "Bitcoin traded close to $44,000 after notching its longest winning streak since May, a rally driven in part by expectations of looser monetary policy.\n\nThe largest digital asset climbed for six days through Tuesday, advancing roughly 16% to as high as $44,491 before giving up some gains. Its 2023 rebound from last year\u2019s crypto rout now stands at 163%.\n\nBitcoin is up almost 80% since mid-September, a rally that saw it take out the $30,000 and $40,000 levels in quick succession. Along with wagers that the Federal Reserve may start cutting interest rates next year, its rise has also been fueled by speculation that the the US may be close to allowing its first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nBlackRock Inc. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June to launch such a product, suggesting crypto could soon gain wider appeal as an asset class.\n\n\u201cSurely the ETF story is well and truly priced?\u201d said Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia Pty. The recent high volatility and \u201cjet-fueled\u201d move up in Bitcoin is instead a reminder that crypto is \u201cmore responsive to a Fed pivot and policy than other asset classes,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now Bitcoin momentum is overshadowing any concerns that the surge is at risk of becoming too stretched. Smaller virtual currencies such as Avalanche and meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin have also been advancing.\n\n\u2018KIMCHI PREMIUM\u2019\n\nThe bullish overall mood is evident across a range of countries. Bitcoin on South Korea\u2019s Upbit and Bithumb exchanges at one point was trading about 4% above the prevailing global price on Wednesday, a return of the so-called \u201ckimchi premium\u201d that made headlines during the pandemic-era bull run in digital assets.\n\nIn Abu Dhabi, crypto mining hardware retailer Phoenix Group Plc jumped 35% on its debut on Tuesday. The firm is the first crypto-related listing in the Middle East. In El Salvador, Nayib Bukele said in a posting on X this week that the nation\u2019s Bitcoin investments had turned profitable. He\u2019s running for reelection after stepping down as president last week.\n\nAnother prop for sentiment is the so-called Bitcoin halving due next year, which will cut in half the amount of tokens that Bitcoin miners receive as reward for their work. The quadrennial event is part of the process of capping Bitcoin supply at 21 million tokens. The coin hit records after the last three halvings.\n\n\u201cBoth micro and macro factors are currently lining up for Bitcoin,\u201d said Zach Pandl, managing director of research at crypto fund provider Grayscale Investments LLC.\n\nBitcoin traded at $44,004 at 10:07 a.m. in London. It peaked at close to $69,000 in November 2021."

In an official announcement on December 5, Lugano announced its acceptance of Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT) as payment methods for invoices issued by Lugano, using the Swiss cryptocurrency platform Bitcoin Suisse.\n\nUnder this new initiative, residents of Lugano can conveniently settle their taxes and various services by scanning the Swiss QR-bill code featured on their invoices and executing the transaction using their preferred mobile wallet and the chosen cryptocurrency.\n\nThis development is part of Lugano's broader Plan B, a collaborative venture with Tether aimed at leveraging Bitcoin technology to revolutionize the city's financial system. Bitcoin Suisse, serving as the technical partner in this integrated payment solution, supports Lugano in accepting Bitcoin and Tether payments for tax payment and other invoices related to municipal services.\n\nChief Product Officer at Bitcoin Suisse, Armin Schmid, said:\n\n\u201cIt is great to see that more and more Swiss municipalities are offering payments in cryptocurrencies as an option available to both citizens and companies, complementing traditional payment methods such as post-office counters and e-banking platforms.\u201d\n\nLugano has implemented blockchain-based solutions in the past, including integrating the Polygon chain on the MyLugano app, LVGA Points payment token, Lugano digital franc, and the 3Achain blockchain infrastructure. Other Swiss municipalities like Zug started accepting Bitcoin and Ether for tax payments from local individuals and companies in 2021, while Zermatt introduced the option to pay taxes with Bitcoin in partnership with Bitcoin Suisse in January 2020.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Bug Fix on Bitcoin Core Could End Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 Token, According to Bitcoin Developer\n\nA bug fix on the Bitcoin Core network in the v27 upgrade could reportedly halt the creation of new Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which have been causing network congestion due to their exploitation of a vulnerability, according to a prominent Bitcoin Core developer.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals, introduced in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor, are satoshis (sats) that have been inscribed with a piece of information, such as text or an image. This piece of information makes the sat unique and turns it into a de-facto NFT.\n\nLuke Dashjr, founder and CTO of OCEAN mining pool, claimed that inscriptions used by Ordinals and BRC-20 creators to embed data on satoshis are \u201cexploiting a vulnerability\u201d in the Bitcoin Core network, resulting in \"spamming the blockchain.\"\n\nDashjr explained that the Bitcoin Core code has allowed users to set limits on the size of extra data in transactions since 2013, but inscriptions bypass this limit by obfuscating their data as program code.\n\nThe bug that allows inscriptions to bypass this limit was recently fixed in the latest update to Bitcoin Knots, a derivative of Bitcoin Core.\n\nWhen asked if Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens would cease to exist once the vulnerability is fixed, Dashjr confirmed that they would no longer be operational. However, existing inscriptions would still remain.\n\nDashjr has strongly opposed Ordinal inscriptions since its onset, claiming that they are causing significant and irreversible damage to Bitcoin and its users. Earlier in May, he proposed to ban BRC-20s by extending spam filtration to Bitcoin\u2019s recently introduced Taproot transactions.\n\nRecently, Ordinals have experienced a resurgence in activity, causing the transaction fee on Bitcoin to surpass Ethereum\u2019s. According to Bitinfo, the average BTC transaction fee is currently $19.48. During the Ordinals frenzy in May this year, transaction fees reached a high of over $31."

The cryptocurrency surging as of late now trading near $44,000. That's its highest level in nearly two years. One of the drivers of the recent rally has been optimism over regulatory approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Our next guest runs one of the companies waiting to hear from the Securities and Exchange. Joining us now Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale CEO. Good to see you, Michael. Thanks for coming in.\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: It's great to be here.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: So I guess, let's start with price here. What do you make of this latest surge? A lot of it does seem to be overanticipation that you guys and others are going to get approvals. Is the market setting itself up for disappointment here?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, there's been a lot of optimism in the market. I think a lot of that started earlier this year when our court case came to fruition. We won against the SEC, vacated that denial order of GBTC to uplist as a spot Bitcoin ETF. I think since that time, the macro environment, because bitcoin means different things to different folks, you have seen some investors flocking to bitcoin, flocking to gold, in a rising rate environment as an inflation hedge for their portfolios.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut maybe now as we're kind of turning the chapter into the new year, we're seeing the Fed may be going to start cutting rates. You could see us move into a more risk-on environment. And some investors allocating to Bitcoin thinking more about it as a technology investment or a risk asset.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And, Michael, as you said, bitcoin means different things to different folks. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has a view. You won't be surprised, he didn't mince words. That bank here on Capitol Hill today, he spoke about it. Let's take a listen to that, get your reaction.\n\nJAMIE DIMON: We've been deeply opposed to crypto, bitcoin, et cetera. You pointed out, the only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, anti-money laundering, tax avoidance. And that is a use case. Because it is somewhat anonymous, not fully, and because you can move money instantaneously, and because it doesn't go through, as you mentioned, all these systems have built up over many years, know your customer, sanctions, OFAC. It's-- they can get bypassed all of that. If I were the governments, I'd close it down.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: So listen, I mean, in some sense, Michael, you know, Jamie Dimon kind of echoing some comments he's made in the past. He's been a skeptical. He doesn't mince words. But let's get your response to his response there.\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, listen, I think every executive, particularly in the financial services space, is going to have their own opinions on new technologies and whether that's crypto or bitcoin specifically. But if you take a big step back, there is no question that this asset class is here to stay, that investor interest in this asset class is only growing. And it is these exact types of entities, these legacy institutions, these banks, that are already well underway on evolving their business models to account for these new technologies.\n\nSo regardless of the opinions that some of these executives may have, these banks and these large institutions have to position themselves for the modern-day investor. And that includes adopting new technologies like crypto."

Many companies, including Fidelity, Invesco, Grayscale, and others are patiently waiting for SEC approval for a spot bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up more than 20% for the month as sentiment grows bullish for the cryptocurrency on approval hopes. Yahoo Finance Jared Blikre joins the Live show to break down the latest numbers and developments surrounding BlackRock and bitcoin.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRADLEY SMITH: We've also got to talk a little Black Rock on the morning, receiving $100,000 as seed capital for its proposed Bitcoin ETF. That was disclosed in an application to the SEC this week. The investor bought $4,000 at $25 a share in October of this year.\n\nThis comes about a month before analysts anticipate either one or more spot ETFs will get approval from regulators. For more on this, let's bring in Yahoo Finance's reporter Jared Blikre. He's here at the desk.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Brad, oh, don't let me get too comfortable.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Big day.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: This is nice.\n\nBRADLEY SMITH: Yes.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: And I do have the Wi-Fi interactive here right in front of me, of course. But I'm looking at the list of companies. You mentioned BlackRock. You look at the list of companies on the Wi-Fi interactive that currently have spot Bitcoin ETFs just waiting for approval.\n\nHere's BlackRock. Here's Grayscale, a word on them in a second. Fidelity, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, all of these guys jockeying to be the first, but it's probably going to be all of them at once except maybe Grayscale.\n\nNow, Grayscale is the entity that manages the GBTC, that's the Grayscale Bitcoin investment trust, one of the few in the world only available to private subscribers. It's a closed-end fund. They've wanted to convert it to an ETF, so they can get retail investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd they were the ones who filed the lawsuit and they won with respect to the SEC. They beat the SEC. But it's not clear if they're going to be among these first movers.\n\nBut as far as the date, we're looking at January 10-- January 5 to January 10. There are two different offices within the SEC that have to clear this, two different Congressional laws at work. You have the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act and you also have the 1933 Securities Act. And paperwork was just filed by BlackRock.\n\nAnd that information you were talking about, the seed investor. Who's investing in this ETF that hasn't been launched yet? Well, a seed investor. This is how you start the process.\n\nAnd so we, kind of, knew that already. It already leaked out. But this is confirmation and just another incremental step, more incremental knowledge that this is going to happen and happen soon early January.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Jared, how much of this do you think is already baked in just in terms of the excitement? And I say that with the price of Bitcoin because it has been astonishing to see the rise in the price of Bitcoin going back to the start of the year. Even within the last month, it's up another 20%. If we do see this approval, how big of a catalyst do you think?\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, you know, the old adage on Wall Street is buy the rumor, sell the news. I hope not because I'm looking at the Wi-Fi interactive, Bitcoin is the-- crypto in general it's the number one asset class of the year. I mean, forget the Magnificent Seven, Bitcoin up 152%.\n\nLet's take a look at this chart in anticipation of all of this. Arguably, this got started down here. I mean, we've been hearing about this for months, but the anticipation really led to this latest launch up. We had Bitcoin stuck at about 30,000.\n\nSo I think a lot of this news is already baked in. But I think the momentum is there to keep Bitcoin alive. I think the winter is done.\n\nI don't think we're ever going to see 20,000 again. You can quote me on that. And I think it's off to the races."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin has seen its biggest value boost since the 2022 cryptocurrency market crash.\n\nOn Wednesday (Dec. 6) Bitcoin was trading above $44,000, a far cry away from the $17,000 it was trading at during early 2023 \u2013 after the collapse of the Terra LUNA cryptocurrency ignited the biggest sell-off in the history of the sector last November. Leading many in the industry to wonder if crypto would ever recover from the crash.\n\nThe price surge for Bitcoin comes amidst boosts for other cryptocurrencies \u2013 with Ethereum (ETH) up 10% in the last week, Solano (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) up between 7% and 27% in the last week as well. This surge comes alongside blockchain messaging service Wormside receiving $225m in funding \u2013 the largest market raise of 2023 for crypto.\n\nThe recovery has been welcome news for many, but especially the country of El Salvador \u2013 which yields the most federal holdings of bitcoin in the world \u2013 which now looks at a profit from its investment in the market for the first time since 2021.\n\nHope of US ETF approval drives Bitcoin price\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has been reinforced by renewed calls for the US to approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) \u2013 which would invite more mainstream investment into the crypto sphere.\n\nApproval would be a milestone achievement for Bitcoin and validation it is a conventional asset. However, there have been discussions for years on this topic with nothing having been motioned so far.\n\nAlthough analysts do warn that failure to approve an ETF for cryptocurrencies, by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could result in another crash for the bitcoin market.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, research analyst for the investment firm Fineqia International Matteo Greco said:\n\n\u201cAn approval (from the SEC) is expected to bring short-term capital influx from the traditional finance investors, fuelling the uptrend, while a rejection might trigger a short-term negative price action due to high expectations of approval by market participants.\u201d\n\n\u201cA rejection could prompt market participants to adjust their positions, potentially leading to a downward trend in January. Analysts remain confident, however, maintaining a 90% probability of approval.\u201d\n\nFeatured image:"

        "title": "As Bitcoin reaches the $44,000 threshold, why the surge and what\u2019s next? - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s rapid-fire ascent to $44,000 comes on the back of roughly 25% gains in the last week. The grandfather of all cryptocurrencies has had an even more lucrative 2023, rising 158% from its year-ago levels, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nGiven how long the crypto world has been dealing with a downturn, what\u2019s driving Bitcoin\u2019s price ascent and similar value gains among other tokens? And can the good vibes continue into the new year?\n\n\u201cThe main impetus for the bitcoin price rise seems to be the upcoming approval of the [spot] bitcoin ETF and the additional capital flows that will follow after the ETF is live,\u201d said Tegan Kline, CEO of Edge & Node, a company that is behind a protocol for organizing blockchain data.\n\nLuke Nolan, a research associate at CoinShares, thinks the \u201ckick-off\u201d of this Bitcoin rally came on the back of the mid-October ruling from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that closed the June 2022 suit between the SEC and digital asset manager Grayscale. The federal court issued a final ruling that ordered the SEC to rescind its rejection of the firm\u2019s Bitcoin spot ETF application.\n\n\u201cWe have seen tremendous buying for two reasons as a result of this,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cPeople front-running what they believe will be significant flows stemming from the potential launches of the ETFs [and] if the SEC approves a spot bitcoin ETF, there is a \u2018stamp of approval\u2019 for the asset class from the largest capital market regulator in the world.\u201d If that happens, bitcoin could see more capital inflows, potentially boosting its value.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price surge into year-end has been exceptionally encouraging, as it has been accompanied by the highest trading volume it has seen since November 2022, said Joel Kruger, LMAX Group currency strategist.\n\n\u201cOf course, one of the main fundamental catalysts is coming from anticipation of mass institutional and mainstream adoption in 2024 as channels are opened up that will allow for easier access to bitcoin exposure,\u201d Kruger said.\n\nWhile ETF excitement is the driver being cited most frequently right now, it is unlikely that near-term demand for an ETF will be large enough to justify these price moves alone, said Wolf CEO Kelly Brewster.\n\n\u201cWhat seems substantially different this cycle is that there is a lot of activity happening around Bitcoin beyond those simply buying the asset expecting that it will appreciate,\u201d Brewster said. \u201cThere has been significant growth in layer-2 technologies such as the Lightning Network, collectibles and NFT projects that leverage the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol, and exciting new innovations like Taproot Assets from Lightning Labs, which is making Bitcoin a multi-asset network.\u201d\n\nMomentum has been \u201cconsistently building\u201d for Bitcoin-focused builders this year, said Muneeb Ali, CEO and co-founder of Trust Machines. \u201cWe are entering an era of Bitcoin that we have never seen before. One where scaling the usability of Bitcoin unlocks billions in untapped value.\u201d\n\nAnd the weekly crypto asset flows data from CoinShares supports that, Nolan noted. \u201cFor the last several weeks we have seen consistently high inflows into crypto funds,\u201d he said. The 10-week total was $1.76 billion, taking the total for the year to $1.84 billion in crypto asset flows. That amount has been \u201clargely dominated\u201d by bitcoin with year-to-date flows of $1.68 billion.\n\nOf course, other factors are contributing to this rally, too. For example, there seems to be a renewed appreciation for Bitcoin\u2019s security model and simplicity, and what is clearly different for Bitcoin this time around is that a lot of the things piloted on other blockchains during the last bull market are now being rebuilt on Bitcoin.\n\nWhat should we expect for Bitcoin in 2024?\n\n\u201cBitcoin is a very volatile asset, and so in the short term it would not be surprising to see $50,000 on the back of the technical factors that contribute to an upside squeeze,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cConversely, in every significant rally for bitcoin, prices can retrace 20%+ before resuming a longer positive trend. Looking at the weekly chart, we have seen eight green candles in a row. It would be largely unsurprising to see prices cool down in the near term and pull back 10\u201315%. But bitcoin often doesn\u2019t act the way it should.\u201d\n\nGiven that trends have a way of pushing into year-end, Kruger thinks it\u2019s quite possible the upside pressure will persist throughout December with \u201csetbacks exceptionally well supported into dips.\u201d\n\nThe rapid pace of this price movement is \u201cnot uncommon in the crypto space,\u201d Edge & Node\u2019s Kline said. \u201cWhile price corrections can happen, the current rally appears to be underpinned by strong fundamental factors, suggesting that the upside potential may be greater than in previous instances.\u201d\n\nKruger said he wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised to see Bitcoin close out 2023 in the \u201cnext big resistance zone, which we see in the $48,000 to $53,000 area.\u201d\n\nIn the long-term, if the easing of financial conditions plays out the way the market is expecting, and there are rate cuts in the middle of next year, as well as an increase of global liquidity, which seems likely, these factors would be positive to support a sustained rally and we very well could see Bitcoin at $70,000 by the end of 2024 \u201cas a conservative estimate,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nKruger expects more bullish price action, too, predicting that Bitcoin\u2019s price will push to a \u201cfresh record high\u201d and potentially \u201cchallenge the major psychological barrier at $100,000.\u201d\n\nOptimism is seemingly back in crypto markets, especially for Bitcoin, and if the momentum keeps up long-term, 2024 can be a strong year for the industry, startup activity and market players alike."

Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally comes amid heightened speculation that an SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF is on the anvil and would play a major role in driving the crypto market to new highs.\n\nOne of the major reasons behind this heightened speculation is the recent resolution of legal issues faced by Binance.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, the largest global cryptocurrency exchange, recently agreed to plead guilty to federal criminal charges.

Since then, the decision has been subject to intense domestic and international criticism, often due to unrealized losses from the government\u2019s own BTC investments.\n\nHowever, after the latest crypto market rally, Bukele has reported that El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin investments are finally in the black.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s Holds BTC Worth $131M\n\nAfter buying large amounts of BTC in the $45,000\u2013$60,000 range back in 2021/2022, the government of El Salvador saw the value of its holdings plummet throughout the prolonged crypto winter that followed.\n\nYet, throughout the 2022 bear market, Bukele\u2019s government continued to buy. Significantly, its last major purchase in December 2022 occurred near the bottom of the market. From a high of around $55,000, that investment helped bring the average price paid for Bitcoin in its portfolio down to just above $40,000.\n\nEl Salvador's #Bitcoin investments are in the black!

If the value of its reserves continues to grow, the government could sell its BTC at a tidy profit. But Bukele insisted that \u201cwe have no intention of selling.\u201d\n\n#Bitcoin | Estrategia de inversi\u00f3n del Presidente @nayibbukele en bitcoin genera m\u00e1s de $3.5 millones en ganancias.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged past $42,000 following reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve a spot bitcoin ETF in January. The crypto rally comes even as crypto lending firm Nexo faced SEC fines, though Nexo Co-Founder Antoni Trenchev remains focused on building out crypto infrastructure.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance, Trenchev says the crypto market is sending \"mixed signals\" lately. Trenchev is optimistic in the long term as events in the crypto space, like Binance's settlement and hopefulness on a bitcoin ETF approval, illustrate different paths for regulation.\n\nHe states the crypto shakeout after FTX's collapse has weeded out \"weak hands,\" allowing resilient assets like bitcoin to rebound. With momentum regaining in the digital asset, Trenchev sees a spot ETF as increasingly attractive. He even predicts Bitcoin could reach $100,000.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: For more on the crypto sector, let's get to Antoni Trenchev, Nexo co-founder. Antoni, good to talk to you today. You certainly haven't been immune from the shakedown that has played out within the crypto sector. You had to take down a $45 million fine from the SEC. As you think about where crypto is today compared to pre-FTX collapse, pre what happened with Binance, how has that changed your strategy? How has that changed your thinking about how Nexo moves forward?\n\nANTONI TRENCHEV: Well, we have been very focused on building out the infrastructure. This is the great thing about bear markets, that you can refine your product, your infrastructure, whether it means technology or the legal aspects, licensing, and underpinning what underpins the enterprise. That's what have been very focused on this past few years and increasingly.\n\nSo after the FTX collapse, right now, I think we are in a sort of a situation where we have mixed signals. On the one side, we have all the positive things that have happened in the space, you know, the settlement that Binance has, the Bitcoin spot ETF that appears to be around the corner. And I'm certainly in the camp of believers. And then we have some messages from the Treasury from the SEC that they continue to be quite aggressive on crypto, and we have to see how it plays out. But ultimately, I'm very optimistic here.\n\nStory continues\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And actually, we have to talk about this rally that we've seen. How much of that is just about this hype around the spot Bitcoin ETF being approved versus looking further ahead to the Bitcoin halving event in 2024?\n\nANTONI TRENCHEV: Well, I think it's both. I think Bitcoin is sound fundamentally in the sense that we saw a deleveraging after the FTX collapse. We saw a shakeout of the weak hands, and Bitcoin has been transferred to stronger diamond hands, which now will hold on forever, that on the one side. And then just, like, structurally from a market perspective, we have everybody write Bitcoin off. It was like shows like yours all but stopped talking about Bitcoin for a few months.\n\nAnd this also tells you a little bit about sentiment. And Bitcoin having this pre-programmed disinflationary mechanism that Bitcoin has and built in its code, I think it strikes a right note in this inflationary times. And you know, I think this, garnered with the Bitcoin spot ETF frenzy, is what is ultimately going to propel us from here, if we can hold the 42 level, which is very important, up to 50 in the short-term. Then there might be some correction and some profit taking and sell the news type of event. But then, until the end of year, I definitely could see it go up to 100k at the end of 2024.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: 100,000 by the end of the year, what's the catalyst?\n\nANTONI TRENCHEV: Well, the catalyst would be the Bitcoin halving. This is certainly what we saw in 2022 when it occurred around the mid of May. Some caution here for your viewers, who are about to go in long in crypto with the funds from the college tuitions for their children. Before that, we saw an intraday tank of 50% just prior to the halving, just a few months before that in 2022.\n\nSo crypto is not a one-way street, but I do see the Bitcoin ETF as an institutional draw, the draw of institutional money. And then the halving will be a huge event. And then if and when the Fed pivots from its very aggressive hiking cycle, and it plateaus out or even starts cutting rates, this will be the ultimate impetus for all risk-on assets, of which Bitcoin is the par excellence."

        "content": "This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d Cryptocurrency is a young asset class that has developed a reputation for price volatility however there are ETFs that could help mitigate risk for those investors seeking crypto exposure. During VettaFi\u2019s Alternatives Symposium on November 28th, industry experts discussed their positive outlook for crypto in 2024.\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets.\u201d This includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Crypto Data (through December 5, 2023)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has soared during the last few days with the digital currency closing above $44,000 for the first time since April 2022. BTC is now up ~165% year to date. Explore two of the factors behind Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge.\n\nXRP\u2019s price was little changed from last week and is currently up ~82% year to date.\n\nEther\u2019s price also jumped this week as it nears $2,300 for the first time since May 2022. ETH is now up ~90% year to date.\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), and Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).\n\nOriginally published on Advisor Perspectives.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "Bitcoin's Rally Crushes Crypto Stocks Short Traders, Resulting in $2.6B in Losses Over Last 3 Months\n\nBitcoin (BTC)'s recent aggressive rebound has dealt a devastating blow to short sellers of crypto stocks, resulting in losses exceeding $2.6 billion in less than three months, according to financial data firm S3 Partners. The rally began on September 11, when Bitcoin hit a three-month low of $25,152, and since then, the coin has surged by an impressive 75% to its current price of $43,975. This unexpected rise has caught short sellers off guard.\n\nCrypto stocks, such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy, tend to correlate with the broader crypto market and have experienced significant gains due to Bitcoin's improving fortunes. Coinbase stock alone has surged by 51% in the past month, reaching $143.63. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, which holds approximately $6.6 billion worth of Bitcoin, has seen an 82% increase since October, with its stock now valued at $568.88.\n\nAs a result of these substantial upswings, short sellers of crypto stocks have incurred losses of $2.656 billion over the past three months. More than half of these losses were generated from shorting Coinbase stock, with an additional 25% arising from shorting MicroStrategy stock.\n\nShort sellers in the crypto market have experienced significant losses since January, totaling around $6.05 billion. The situation worsened on Tuesday when they lost over $387 million in just 24 hours, setting the stage for a potential short squeeze where struggling short sellers purchase stocks to cover their losses, further driving up stock prices.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Bitcoin Ecosystem Developments in 2023 as BTC Hits Fresh 2023 High - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Joining us now to reflect on Bitcoin's developments in 2023 is CEO of Bitcoin financial services firm Swan Corey Clipston Al Long with co-founder of Stax at Bitcoin Lay two protocol for smart contracts. M Ali. Welcome to the show, Corey and mane. Great to be here. Thanks for having me. Awesome. Thanks. Thanks for having me. Good to see you, Corey. You as well, sir. All right, awesome. Let's get into it. As we know Bitcoin is hitting highs that we haven't seen in over a year. Corey, I want to start with you when you reflect on 2023. What's the most exciting development that's happened for the Bitcoin network? Yeah. So overall for the ecosystem, I'd say the most exciting thing that's going on and I've been talking about this a lot lately is the replacement of the top of funnel for new people getting into Bitcoin the last six years. It's been the world of VC funded crypto, non Bitcoin crypto trying to pump their tokens and, and spend $50 billion of VC funding on marketing. And now that's getting replaced with the largest, most trusted financial firms in the world. Talking about Bitcoin itself. So when you think about maybe the end goal for a company like ours or just for the Bitcoin ecosystem of getting people to take self custody of their Bitcoin and actually understand deeply what it is as a money and as a technology, it's a much better top of funnel that we are swapping and, uh, right now and I think that remains dramatically, uh, underpriced. Um, just swapping out. Does this mean that you, uh, I, I mean, I kinda know your answer here. It is there almost no room for ALTs? Oh, hi, Lawrence. Good to see you as well. Uh, you know, people, people love to gamble and they love lotto tickets and they love playing numbers and they love casinos and I think, you know, if anything, we've seen that human nature doesn't really change and you don't need much more than a meme to attack to, uh, you know, a security or a gambling proposition of some sort and people will play it. So it's really just a matter of, of, you know, letting that kind of run its course. What I do really like and what I think is it has been achieved over the last couple of years is almost anybody that gets into this space at this point and everybody that's in the space already really does have a pretty clear demarcation between Bitcoin and non Bitcoin crypto in their mind and there isn't really any sort of meme about any of the alt coins ever being a better money than Bitcoin. So it's kind of separated itself and in the minds of everybody in the industry. And I think that's really clear when people come into the space. Now, that's the information that they're getting from all sources, from media, from government, from everyone in the industry, everybody on Twitter. And I think that was a heck of accomplishment over the last couple of years by people working their butts off in Bitcoin. Man. I want to turn to you now when it comes to the development of the network, what what's the most prominent thing that happened in 2023 that sticks out in your mind? Yeah, I think 2023 in my view was actually one of the best years for Bitcoin. Um and it like probably in the last 10 years. So I started in 2013 and I would, I would rank 2023 as the best year for Bitcoin. And I think it's mostly for two big reasons uh with things like Cardinals and Bitcoin LWS, we actually started seeing uh competition for block space and which is extremely important, right? Like if you look outside of the Bitcoin world and the rest of the industry, some of the biggest criticisms for Bitcoin would be like around the security budget that how are you going to pay for Bitcoin security in the long term? When, when the Coinbase rewards go down or there would be criticism around developer activity like, hey, how many developers are you guys getting, how many start ups are getting started and people building on Bitcoin? And now there is like real data out there because of oral where Bitcoin fees have actually flipped Ethereum in the, in the last weeks, which is huge, right? Like we were nowhere close to this two years ago. And I think similarly, we are now seeing that there are more transactions happening on the Bitcoin network that are cardinals and other things than, than just the payments and stuff which which has just opened up everyone's eyes to, hey, what else is possible on Bitcoin? And that thing is very important in trying to build a Bitcoin circular economy. And we have seen the interest in Bitcoin L twos just go through the roof. I think there are like 10 plus different projects that got started. And and I'm of the view, obviously, Stax is is doing a major upgrade trying to be close to a Bitcoin L two and have BT C as the main asset that gets used there. But there are new projects that are starting like people are trying to bring ZK roll ups to Bitcoin. People are trying to start different types of L two S and I think we need that experimentation. So for me, the biggest thing that happened in 2023 was developer activity and with things like cardinals the demand for Bitcoin block space just going through the roof. And I think that just solidifies Bitcoin at the number one spot instead of like worrying about other, other networks that are gaining more developers or gaining more users and, and, and getting these applications that that other network, I assume uh would be Ethereum. And, and uh what does this all mean for Ethereum layer two? What does it all mean for is Bitcoin taking those developers away as you, as you're saying, is that, is that what you're implying here? I think, I think we're seeing clear evidence, right? There, there were top NFT marketplaces that were on Ethereum and they switched their focus to Bitcoin. They, they started focusing on Bitcoin. We are seeing a lot of developers like when a new developer starts in this industry, I think the mental model should be that we are in an industry that's expanding but rapidly expanding and new people are entering it all the time when people were entering this year. I think building on Bitcoin was a serious option that they were concerned, right? Even if there are more still more infrastructure challenges or or depth tooling that needs to be built on Bitcoin, people are getting it that Bitcoin is the the Pristine asset as Corey was saying like, you know, but Bitcoin is separated itself as an asset. We were trying to see how Ethereum was trying to be ultrasound money and we are seeing that fade away compared to Bitcoin the asset. But Bitcoin has a technology platform where developers can come and build anything. I think it's ok to admit that other networks like Ethereum or Solana were doing a better job there. So now that's maybe no longer the case that much, right? Things are getting good or better, very, very rapidly. And that's a really good thing for Bitcoin because now when new developers, fresh talent comes in, they look at the great properties of Bitcoin, but the downsides aren't that big anymore, right? So they would, they would they are more likely to decide to build on Bitcoin. And we've seen a rapid increase the number of start ups just in our ecosystem or the broader Bitcoin L one ecosystem getting funded, hiring great developers and building building cool things. And I think that that just makes me really excited. Well, Corey man is talking about new developers, I want to talk about new uh new investors, new, new folks who want to dabble with Bitcoin after the implosion of FTX and now finance settling with the DOJ here in the United States. Uh How has that affected users on Swan? Do have you seen new users or is it the same people who've been there for a while who are interacting with the platform? Yeah, it's, it's hard to parse where the influx of new users comes from like is it people fleeing crypto or is it just new people getting drawn in as they always do by a price rise. But yeah, we've certainly seen a massive influx in users with this price rise from, you know, 25 K up to over 40 k now. Uh As always happens when there's a price pump. Uh The nice thing about Swan is even when the price drops. Uh we have a lot of folks that see that as Bitcoin on sale and so it doesn't really uh negatively affect our volumes unless it's sort of down sideways for, for years or more. Um So yeah, it is, it is a very, very exciting time and again, the signal around Bitcoin has never been stronger. And yeah, you even have the, the crypto inclined or the alt coin crowd uh actually promoting Bitcoin as well as we noted. Uh So it is, it is kind of an interesting moment in time here, uh rounding out 2023 and again, heading into the very good likelihood of some ETF S getting approved in January. Uh It's just a lot of tailwinds here for Bitcoin."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin's annual water footprint has been soaring as mining the cryptocurrency sucks up hundreds of billions of gallons, according to a researcher.\n\nThe peer-reviewed journal Cells Report Sustainability posted commentary last week from Alex de Vries, a doctoral candidate at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, who estimated that bitcoin's water footprint will hit 591 billion gallons this year, up 278% from 2020.\n\n\"Bitcoin's expanding water footprint must be considered in the context of escalating water scarcity,\" he wrote, citing growing water issues in the western US and Kazakhstan, two large crypto mining regions.\n\nMining operations rely on computers to solve complex calculations to unlock new bitcoin tokens. As this is energy-intensive, water is used to cool the computer servers that run them as well as air-conditioning systems. Water is also indirectly consumed as it's used to cool power plants that provide electricity for miners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese uses cause water loss through evaporation, while adding pressure on groundwater supplies.\n\nTo estimate the indirect use, De Vries relied on Cambridge data of the large-scale bitcoin operations in the US, and compared it with the water intensity of electric generation on each specific grid.\n\nWhen adding direct usage, \"the total water footprint of US Bitcoin miners could be equivalent to the average annual water consumption of around 300,000 US households, comparable with a city such as Washington, DC,\" De Vries wrote.\n\nTo lessen mining's water impact, he suggested that miners center operations in areas that rely on renewable energy sources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, some uncertainty remains, as the Cambridge data sample represents only 44% of the global total in bitcoin mining.\n\nMeanwhile, a UN study from October that relied on different data found that mining resulted in a 255 billion-gallon footprint in 2021, much less than De Vries' estimate of 415 billion for that year."

        "title": "Bitcoin price hit 2023 high, so why are retail traders waiting on the sidelines? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market surged past $1.55 trillion on Dec. 5, driven by remarkable weekly gains of 14.5% for Bitcoin (BTC) and 11% for Ether (ETH). Notably, this milestone, marking the highest level in 19 months, propelled Bitcoin to become the world\u2019s ninth-largest tradable asset, surpassing Meta\u2019s $814 billion capitalization.\n\nDespite the recent bullish momentum, analysts have observed that retail demand remains relatively stagnant. Some attribute this to the ripple effects of an inflationary environment and decreased interest in credit, given that interest rates continue to hover above 5.25%. While analyst Rajat Soni\u2019s post may have dramatized the situation, the underlying, in essence, holds true.\n\nRetail investors aren't paying attention to #bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThey are more worried about whether or not they will be able to pay rent or put food on the table.\n\n\n\nThey will likely start paying attention near the next top (IMO sometime in 2025) and they will FOMO into a position before\u2026 \u2014 Rajat Soni, CFA (@rajatsonifnance) December 2, 2023\n\nNumerous United States economic indicators have surged to record highs, including wages, salaries and household net worth. However, analyst Ed Yardeni suggested that the \u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d might have already occurred earlier this year, with the S&P 500 gaining 8.9% in November.\n\nThis rise reflected diminishing inflationary pressures and robust employment data. Yet, investors remain cautious, with approximately $6 trillion in \u201cdry powder\u201d parked in money market funds, waiting on the sidelines.\n\nDid retail traders miss Bitcoin\u2019s and Ether\u2019s recent gains?\n\nWith no dependable indicator to track retail participation in cryptocurrencies, a comprehensive data set is necessary for making conclusions, beyond relying solely on Google Trends and crypto-related app download rankings. To determine if retail traders have missed out on the rally, it\u2019s essential that the indicators align across various sources.\n\nThe premium of Tether (USDT) in China serves as a valuable gauge of retail demand in the crypto market. This premium quantifies the difference between peer-to-peer USDT trades based in yuans and the value of the U.S. dollar. Excessive buying activity typically exerts upward pressure on the premium, while bearish markets often witness an influx of USDT into the market, resulting in a 3% or greater discount.\n\nUSDT peer-to-peer vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKX\n\nOn Dec. 5, the USDT premium relative to the yuan reached 1%, a modest improvement from the previous weeks. However, it remains within the neutral range and hasn\u2019t breached the 2% threshold for over half a year. Whether retail flow gravitates toward Bitcoin or altcoins, Chinese-based investors primarily need to convert cash into digital assets.\n\nTurning the attention to Google Trends, searches for \u201cbuy Bitcoin\u201d and \u201cbuy crypto\u201d reveal a stable pattern over the past three weeks. While there\u2019s no definitive answer to what piques the interest of new retail traders, these queries typically revolve around how and where to purchase cryptocurrencies.\n\nSearch trends index, weekly. Source: Google Trends\n\nNotably, the current 90-day index stands at approximately 50%, showing no signs of recent improvement. This data seems counterintuitive, given that Bitcoin has surged by 53% in the past 50 days, while the S&P 500 has risen by 4.5% during the same period. Importantly, when viewed over a longer time frame, the current search levels remain a staggering 90% below their all-time high in 2021.\n\nRelated: Why is Bitcoin price up today?\n\nFinally, it\u2019s crucial to delve into derivatives markets, specifically perpetual futures, which are the preferred instrument for retail traders. Also known as inverse swaps, these contracts feature an embedded rate that accrues every eight hours. A positive funding rate suggests a greater demand for leverage by longs (buyers), whereas a negative rate indicates that shorts (sellers) are seeking additional leverage.\n\nPerpetual futures weekly funding rate. Source: Coinglass\n\nNotice that the weekly funding rate for most coins fluctuates between 0.2% and 0.4% per week, signaling a slightly higher demand for leverage among longs. However, during bullish periods, this metric can easily surpass 4.3%, which is not presently the case for any of the top seven coins in terms of futures open interest.\n\nCurrently, the influx of retail participants in this cycle remains elusive, particularly in terms of new entrants displaying excessive optimism. While some analysts point to the trend of the Coinbase app, it\u2019s essential to consider that Binance is currently under scrutiny from regulators, with its founder Changzeng Zhao facing potential legal issues. Consequently, existing retail traders may have migrated from offshore exchanges to Coinbase, rather than heralding a new wave of crypto enthusiasts.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

What's more, Robinhood said that the jump in crypto trading came even as November notional trading volumes for equities (stocks) and options contracts remained roughly flat from October levels. It's also a massive positive reversal for Robinhood, considering the firm revealed a 55% year-over-year drop in crypto trading volumes in its third-quarter 2023 report.\n\nHigher trading volumes don't necessarily equate to higher prices for any given asset. But it seems many investors have piled into crypto in recent weeks for fear of missing out on an extended rally in cryptocurrencies that kicked off in mid-October. That's when the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's August reversal of an order preventing crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC: GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund. The move then spurred several hopeful spot bitcoin ETF providers at the time -- including Grayscale, Blackrock, and Fidelity -- to file amended registration statements in anticipation of the SEC's approval.\n\nCryptocurrencies then continued to rise earlier this month as the SEC entered into its first potential approval period for those pending applications. The SEC also reportedly entered into talks with Grayscale at the time regarding the details of its spot bitcoin ETF conversion application.\n\nOn that note, this week has already seen multiple additional amended S-1 filings with the SEC for proposed spot bitcoin ETFs, including revisions from BlackRock and crypto index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management. To many crypto industry watchers, these filings are only the latest signs that the SEC is simultaneously giving similar instructions to multiple potential spot bitcoin ETF providers as it works to iron out the details of their respective applications.\n\nThe crypto ETF deadline to watch\n\nAs I suggested last month, however, investors still shouldn't hold their breath for the first Bitcoin ETF approvals to arrive just yet; note that the first relevant deadline to which the SEC is technically required to respond is Jan. 10, 2024, specifically the date by which it must approve or deny Ark Invest's \"21Shares\" bitcoin ETF application. But rather than approving only Ark's application in isolation at that time, the SEC will almost certainly approve multiple applications at once to avoid giving a so-called first-mover advantage to any single provider.\n\nWith that key Jan. 10, 2024 deadline looming, traders are increasingly excited about the prospect of several new spot bitcoin ETFs providing investors with an easy avenue to diversify into cryptocurrencies. According to data analytics firm CryptoQuant, the resulting capital influx could potentially increase the value of the overall cryptocurrency market by more than $1 trillion over the long term. Given the limited supply of the most popular cryptocurrency tokens, it's easy to see why crypto investors are flocking to put their money back to work before then."

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE): What It Is, History, and Uses - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Dogecoin (DOGE)?\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) is a peer-to-peer, open-source cryptocurrency. It is considered an altcoin and was launched in December 2013 with the image of a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Dogecoin's blockchain has merit with its underlying technology derived from Litecoin. Notable features of Dogecoin\u2014which uses the Scrypt algorithm (pronounced ess-crypt)\u2014are its low price and unlimited supply.\n\nKey Takeaways Dogecoin is an open-source cryptocurrency established in 2013 by Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus.\n\nDogecoin features a Shiba Inu, a Japanese dog breed, as its logo.\n\nIt is based on Litecoin and uses the same proof-of-work technology.\n\nDogecoin has a loyal community of supporters who trade it and use it as a tipping currency for social media content.\n\nHistory of Dogecoin\n\nJackson Palmer, a product manager at the Sydney, Australia, office of Adobe Inc., created Dogecoin with Billy Markus, a software developer at IBM. The intent behind the cryptocurrency was to be a way to satirize the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies.\n\n2013\u20132014\n\nPalmer and Markus launched the coin on Dec. 6, 2013. By Dec. 19, the value of Dogecoin jumped 300%, bolstered by China's policy to forbid its banks from investing in cryptocurrency. Markus and Palmer based Dogecoin's code on Luckycoin, derived from Litecoin (a Bitcoin fork). Initially, they used a randomized block mining reward, but that was changed to a static reward in March 2014. Dogecoin uses Litecoin's Scrypt technology and uses proof-of-work (PoW) on its blockchain.\n\n2015\u20132023\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Dogecoin enthusiasts celebrated when the crypto exchange Binance listed the coin. As of December 2023, Dogecoin's market capitalization was nearly $13.1 billion. Dogecoin's infrastructure is slowly gaining traction with fans and developers and continues to operate and trade due to its active community of miners.\n\nDogecoin surpassed a $1 billion market capitalization for the first time in the crypto bull run of 2017 to 2018.\n\nConcerns About Dogecoin\n\nDogecoin, with beginnings as a memecoin and no blockchain utility other than existing, has an established following who argue\u2014with a fair amount of validity\u2014that their crypto does indeed have utility based on how it has been used. Blockchain and cryptocurrency use cases are often associated with longevity and value, so there are those who claim that the cryptocurrency has no utility. These concerns likely have some influence on Dogecoin's market price.\n\nHowever, the community and active developers argue otherwise. Some of their claims for proof of utility are:\n\nIt is used as money, based on a history of tipping and donations for charities and humanitarian initiatives.\n\nMany online retailers accept it as payment.\n\nIt stores value.\n\nDevelopment continues.\n\nThere doesn't appear to be any other Dogecoin uses as of (December 2023) besides blockchain fees, which are very low compared to Bitcoin's and Ethereum's.\n\nBut to be fair, Bitcoin didn't have much utility initially, either. It was a payment method, just like Dogecoin. Bitcoin's blockchain has been improved, and layers have been built that give it more uses, but the same can be said of Dogecoin. So, if Bitcoin has utility, it stands to reason that Dogecoin also does.\n\nDogecoin vs. Bitcoin\n\nDogecoin marketed itself as a \"fun\" version of Bitcoin with a Shibu Inu dog as its logo. Dogecoin's casual presentation suited the mood of the burgeoning crypto community. Its Scrypt algorithm and unlimited supply were an argument for a faster, more adaptable, and more consumer-friendly version of Bitcoin.\n\nDogecoin is considered an \"inflationary coin,\" while cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are deflationary because there's a ceiling on the number of coins that will be created. Every four years, the amount of Bitcoin released into circulation via mining rewards is halved, and its inflation rate is halved along with it until all coins are released.\n\nWhere Is Dogecoin Traded? You can purchase Dogecoin (DOGE) by establishing an account with one of many cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. Robinhood, a traditional brokerage that enables crypto trades, also supports Dogecoin.\n\nWhat Is Dogecoin Used for? You can spend your Dogecoin with any merchant that chooses to accept it. Many different types of businesses accept DOGE including Elon Musk's SpaceX and the Dallas Mavericks. Many Dogecoin holders use their DOGE to tip content creators on Reddit and other social media platforms.\n\nWhat Will Dogecoin Be Worth in 2025? The future market prices are difficult for anyone to predict. It depends on market conditions, cryptocurrency developments, and investor and user sentiments.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) is a peer-to-peer, open-source cryptocurrency established in 2013. Originally created as somewhat of a joke about cryptocurrency, the token became fairly popular with cryptocurrency fans. The community and developer humor included in the project adds to its appeal and is probably what has made it last longer than many other cryptocurrencies."

The world's largest cryptocurrency was lifted by hopes of approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and growing bets on U.S. interest rate cuts. Spot gold prices touched $2,100 an ounce, hitting a record high as investors rushed into the safe-haven asset.\n\nWall Street catches a breath\n\nU.S. stocks markets slipped Monday, with investors questioning if markets climbed too fast, too soon following five straight weeks of gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 0.11% at close. The S&P 500 dropped 0.54% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.84% amid a Big Tech shares selloff.

The open interest surge has run parallel to Bitcoin\u2019s 26% gain over the same time, with Bitcoin currently trading at just over $44,000.\n\nCME\u2019s Bitcoin futures open interest reached $5.2 billion on Dec. 6. Source: Coinglass\n\nFrom Oct. 1\u201321, 2021, open interest in CME\u2019s Bitcoin futures surged from $1.46 billion to $5.45 billion.\n\nThe rapid uptick in open interest also coincided with a drastic price jump for Bitcoin, from $45,000 to $66,000.\n\nIG Australia analyst Tony Sycamore told Cointelegraph the open interest uptick shows a renewed interest in Bitcoin, but it doesn\u2019t explain how CME traders are positioned.\n\nSycamore pointed to CME\u2019s Nov. 28 report to the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which showed the \u201cbig players\u201d on its platform were sitting net short at the time, with 20,724 short positions compared to 18,979 longs, Sycamore explained.\n\nFutures positions on CME had been net short as of Nov. 28. Source: CFTC\n\nUntil CME\u2019s latest report comes through on Tuesday, Dec. 12, Sycamore said investors won\u2019t be able to see exactly how the players at CME are positioned.\n\n\u201cWhat we can\u2019t see right now is whether the big players have gone from a net short to a net long, Sycamore said. \u201cIf we saw the market getting extremely long, you\u2019d be very worried about a snapback.

A decision on the ETFs is pinned for early January.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s got to be more driving this now. It\u2019s not just the ETF or halving speculation anymore. This is starting to take on a life of its own.\u201d\n\nSycamore said the recent Bitcoin rally could more closely be attributed to crypto\u2019s relationship with the macro environment, looking to the Federal Reserve\u2019s signal to begin cutting interest rates as a more significant driver of price action.\n\nIn November, CME nabbed the top spot in Bitcoin futures open interest from Binance, which many interpreted as a signal that traditional finance institutions were beginning to show a greater appetite for crypto products.\n\nMany analysts believe a spot ETF approval will result in a rapid upward price tick for Bitcoin, but not everyone is convinced the current rally can stick, with some predicting a \u201csell the news\u201d style event in the days and weeks following a potential approval.\n\nMagazine: This is your brain on crypto \u2014 Substance abuse grows among crypto traders"

        "content": "The recovery of the bitcoin price to all-time highs will be \u201csignificantly quicker\u201d this cycle, according to the latest K33 Research report.\n\nThe drawdown has lasted for 755 days so far, currently around 36% off bitcoin\u2019s all-time high of around $69,000 set in November 2021. That compares to the 1,178 days spent before recovery post-2013 and the 1,092 days post-2017, K33 Senior Analyst Vetle Lunde and Vice President Anders Helseth noted.\n\n\u201cNeither of the past cycles saw institutional demand comparable to the current, with major financial institutions both participating in the space and vocally vouching for BTC -4.78% in public,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cIn 36 days, U.S. ETFs will receive their final verdict, and the market shows considerable demand to accumulate exposure ahead of anticipated launches,\u201d they added \u2014 arguing that the current run-up is caused by a real and compelling narrative.\n\nHowever, \u201cWhether we revisit the $69,000 all-time high or not depends on the genuine flows the actual ETF will bring in the first few weeks of trading. Otherwise, this sets things up for the classic \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 moment next year,\u201d analysts at QCP Capital warned today.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., having previously approved futures-based funds in 2021. The next deadlines for the SEC\u2019s decision to approve, reject or delay applications from firms including BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity and Valkyrie fall in mid-January. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart recently said the window for potential spot bitcoin ETF approval was looking like it would fall between Jan. 5 and Jan. 10.\n\nData from institutional traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also suggests they are not taking profit yet, with annualized premiums above 17% for bitcoin and ether and open interest at all-time highs, Lunde and Helseth noted. The premium is the difference between the spot price of an asset and the price of its futures.\n\nRetail traders 'not wild yet'\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 164% year-to-date price rise has not been mirrored by an increase in retail participation, Lunde and Helseth said. Website traffic data and exchange reports show retail demand is lower now than Q3 2022, they added.\n\nVisitors to crypto websites, often used as a proxy for retail interest, have declined about 50% compared to a year ago, aligning with Coinbase\u2019s Q3 report highlighting trading volume had continued to slide since 2021.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nGoogle search volumes for Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crypto-related terms show a similar trend, according to The Block\u2019s data dashboard.\n\nCrypto-native derivative trading in the offshore market is not showing signs of \u201cretail froth\u201d either, the analysts said, with funding rates still at neutral. Though there are some signs of increased retail appetite building long exposure, they are \u201ccertainly not at alarming levels yet,\u201d the K33 analysts added.\n\n\u201cThe fact that retail participation remains shallow points towards BTC having a substantial ability to gear up further if crypto again finds its way into the limelight,\u201d Lunde and Helseth argued.\n\nBitcoin's price rally continues\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $43,747, according to The Block\u2019s price data. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now up over 16% over the last week and 25% over the past month, having returned to levels not seen since the Terra ecosystem crash in May 2022.\n\nIn terms of altcoins, ether is up 10% over the last week to more than $2,260 \u2014 an 86% rise year-to-date. Solana rose 5% over the same period \u2014 now up over 500% this year. Meanwhile, BNB traded flat last week amid Binance\u2019s legal and regulatory troubles, which have seen the cryptocurrency fall in 2023; it is down 6% year-to-date."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission appears to be having fruitful discussions with spot Bitcoin ETF applicants.\n\nIn late November, both crypto asset manager Grayscale and Wall Street titan Blackrock confirmed having meetings with the SEC to discuss their respective Bitcoin ETF applications. Both firms have since submitted amendments to their applications in the form of S-1 filings. And though these amendments aren\u2019t quite the same as having a transcript of those meetings, they do provide some clues about what the securities regulator has been saying.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the amendments suggest that the SEC is carefully weighing these applications, rather than rejecting them outright like it has so many times in the past\u2014often citing the potential for Bitcoin market manipulation in its denials of the investment product.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlackRock filed a second amendment to its initial June S-1 registration last night. The application for the iShares Bitcoin Trust, which would provide investors with exposure to BTC without the need to buy and hold the asset directly, now specifically mentions the U.S.\u2019s instant settlement system Fedwire and Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or the SWIFT network.\n\nPotential Fedwire and SWIFT outages have always been mentioned as risks in BlackRock\u2019s agreement to use Coinbase Prime as its prime broker. But they\u2019re now included in a section that got a lot longer and more specific about reasons why share redemptions for the ETF might be suspended and how investors would be notified.\n\nOther reasons include \u201cdisruption or fork of the Bitcoin network, hacking, cybersecurity breach, or power, Internet, or Bitcoin network outage,\u201d according to the December 4 SEC filing. It\u2019s all wording that was in an October amendment to the S-1 filing, but now written to more clearly spell out that it could lead to a suspension of share redemptions.\n\nIf BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF needs to be dissolved, it\u2019s not going to give investors the BTC it bought with their money. The S-1 registration now says that the underlying BTC would be liquidated and distributed to investors as cash\u2014\u201dshareholders are not entitled to any of the Trust\u2019s underlying Bitcoin holdings.\u201d\n\nAnother new section specifies that market makers from whom the Trust purchases Bitcoin are required to perform due diligence to ensure that the funds \u201cwere not derived from, or associated with, unlawful or criminal activity.\u201d It\u2019s a timely addition. Binance last month paid $4.3 billion to settle federal charges. Among them was an allegation that the crypto exchange had weak money laundering controls.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe regulator seems to have also been concerned about how shareholders can get reliable intraday price information.\n\nTo that end, the BlackRock filing has gotten more detailed in spelling out that investors can use the CME CF Bitcoin Real Time Index, or BRTI, which is \u201cupdated every 15 seconds\u201d during Nasdaq\u2019s regular market session from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET. That cadence is industry standard for determining the intraday value of exchange-traded funds, but appears to be something the SEC wanted made clear for traders.\n\nCME launched its BRTI real-time price index in 2018, writing at the time in an announcement that it was \u201caccelerating the professionalization of Bitcoin trading and further establishing cryptocurrencies as a new asset class.\u201d\n\nEarlier versions of BlackRock\u2019s filing have mentioned the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rates and Benchmarks Index. Although similar, those two references publish once per day right as trading ends in a handful of major financial markets like Hong Kong, London, and New York.\n\nThe BlackRock filing shows that the Wall Street titan has already sold $100,000 worth of shares to a seed investor at a price of $25 per share. Not an implied approval by any means, but a sign that the asset manager is feeling bullish enough to get the ETF seeded.\n\nThe new version of the iShares Bitcoin Trust registration now also discloses that Coinbase Custody, the custodian of choice for most Bitcoin ETF applicants, has insurance coverage of up to $320 million to cover \u201closses of the digital assets it custodies on behalf of its clients.\u201d BlackRock, however, isn\u2019t guaranteeing that coverage or that shareholder losses will be covered by the company\u2019s policy.\n\nA section on the custodian\u2019s liabilities now also defines a narrow set of circumstances under which Coinbase would be expected to cover shareholder losses: \u201cIn general, the Bitcoin Custodian is not liable under the Custodian Agreement unless in the event of its negligence, fraud, material violation of applicable law or willful misconduct.\u201d\n\nFor Bitwise, which also filed an amendment to its Bitcoin ETF application yesterday, some of the changes are more straightforward. The name of the potential fund has been changed from \u201cBitwise Bitcoin ETP Trust\u201d to \u201cBitwise Bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe other changes in Bitwise\u2019s application cover a lot of the same ground as Blackrock by spelling out the risks of investing in a trust that buys Bitcoin.\n\nEven though the SEC still has another month before it\u2019s due to make a decision on any of the Bitcoin ETF applications, investors have been dumping cash into crypto exchange-traded products at a blistering pace. Last week saw $176 million go into crypto ETPs. And if investors deposit funds at the same rate this week, that could bring the three-month total to almost $2 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s still no guarantees that the market will have a spot Bitcoin ETF any time soon. But the recent changes add a bit more context to the wave of delays announced last month.\n\nEdited by Guillermo Jimenez"

        "title": "BRC-20 style tokens are spreading to chains beyond Bitcoin. But why? - The Block",
        "content": "When the ORDI -7.81% token temporarily crossed a $1 billion market cap earlier this week, it became the first BRC-20 token to hit this milestone.\n\nFollowing in its wake are a number of other BRC-20 tokens, all hoping to be the next hyped up memecoin or coin du jour. Yet what\u2019s peculiar is that these tokens \u2014 which were created on Bitcoin through a workaround because it doesn\u2019t have native support for tokens \u2014 are now expanding to other chains that do support native tokens.\n\nOn Bitcoin, an inscription is where an individual satoshi \u2014 the smallest unit of bitcoin \u2014 gets associated with a piece of data, such as an image for an NFT or a token. This is done using a small amount of data storage space that\u2019s available when making transactions. Tokens made in this way on Bitcoin are called BRC-20 tokens and each token is part of its own collection.\n\nWhen brought to other chains, these token standards are given their own names, like PRC-20 on Polygon PoS, but it\u2019s the same core idea. Such tokens include Ethscriptions on Ethereum, Doginals on Dogecoin and Solana Inscriptions on Solana.\n\nThe blockchains Celo, Avalanche and Fantom have each seen more than 20 million inscriptions on their networks, while Polygon PoS counts 109 million inscriptions, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard created by Hildobby, a pseudonymous researcher at VC firm Dragonfly. In total there have been more than 200 million inscriptions for thousands of tokens across 11 blockchains other than Bitcoin.\n\nThis is also causing huge spikes in network activity on these chains. These blockchains are seeing major surges in the number of transactions made per day as users mint and transfer these tokens. For instance, the number of transactions being made per day on the Celo blockchain, as a seven-day moving average, has risen from 277,000 transactions per day to 3.7 million.\n\nThis activity has even caught the eye of Tron founder Justin Sun. He posted on X asking for community feedback on bringing support for inscriptions to Tron and enabling the creation of BRC-20 tokens on the network.\n\nBeyond this, NFTs are also being launched on other blockchains \u2014 that again, have native NFT support \u2014 using the same approach. For instance, Ethereum Punks has recreated the original CryptoPunk collection but using inscriptions.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nThe development has raised questions over why these tokens are spreading to other chains. These chains have their own native support for creating tokens so they don\u2019t need to apply this workaround. Plus, these tokens are arguably bad for the network since they aggressively expand the blockchain\u2019s data requirements, making it harder for those running nodes or validators on the networks \u2014 a reason why some Bitcoin developers are trying to get rid of inscriptions.\n\nEric Wall, co-founder of Bitcoin NFT collection Taproot Wizards, reckoned that these kinds of tokens are proving popular because they enable wider participation in the token mining process. He said this is somewhat similar to proof-of-work mining that is used for Bitcoin \u2014 something that\u2019s no longer particularly accessible to the average person.\n\n\u201cIf you make it so that the issuance of 100% of the coin supply of a BRC-20, SLP-20 or [Ethereum Virtual Machine]-equivalent derivative requires you to spam not one, not two, but several days (or even months!) of full blocks in any of these chains it means you now have [an] open-to-anyone issuance mechanism. A bit similar to Proof-of-Work mining issuance; we can call it \u201dProof-of-Wasted-Blockspace.\u201d he said on X.\n\nHedgedHog, a high-profile crypto trader and co-founder of eGirl Capital, said that speculation is likely taking place because these tokens are a new vertical with no previous pricing metrics or point of reference. \u201cI kind of think it's just flavor of the month,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are taking off but it's all speculation.\u201d\n\nAnother element is that transacting with inscription-based tokens can be cheaper than with tokens built natively on blockchains. This is because it's cheaper to move, for instance, Ethereum's native coin ether (ETH) \u2014 and the inscription-based token along with it \u2014 than using a token built natively on Ethereum using smart contracts.\n\n\"Inscription-based tokens are expanding to chains that have native token support because the inscriptions approach is 10x+ cheaper than using Smart Contracts and just as decentralized,\" said Tom Lehman, creator of Ethscriptions, claiming that smart contracts are unnecessary and a waste of money.\n\n"

        "content": "The potential approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the looming BTC mining reward halving and major regulatory and enforcement actions have a profound psychological effect on market prices.\n\nThis is a key takeaway from the Next Block Expo conference in Berlin, just as Bitcoin tipped past $42,000 for the first time in over a year.\n\nAnimoca Brands CEO Robby Yung, gumi Cryptos Capital managing partner Miko Matsumura, Binance regional manager Jonas J\u00fcnger, and Polkastarter business development lead Jo\u00e3o Leite weighed in on whether the current cryptocurrency bear market was coming to an end in a conversation with Cointelegraph.\n\nBitcoin halving is a psychological phenomenon\n\nConsidering the influence of the four-year cycle between Bitcoin (BTC) mining reward halvings, Matsumura likens the rhythm to that of a medieval battering ram.\n\n\u201cEvery four years, we swing the ram, and we smash. Four years is long enough that the people inside the castle think we\u2019ve gone away,\u201d the venture capitalist explains.\n\nRelated: Animoca\u2019s Yat Siu bullish on TON partnership as Bitcoin sets strong foundation for 2024\n\nMatsumura says that the halving cycle involves an inherent Schelling focal point mechanism, which is a game theory concept and social phenomenon where people or organizations can coordinate without communication.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to think about it as a psychological training phenomenon because each time it works, it inclines people to go with it the next time it happens.\u201d\n\nHe also suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s stock-to-flow model clearly shows that the actual cut in BTC supply is getting smaller with each halving, which means \u201cthe actual mathematical economic effect is smaller.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s Gareth Jenkinson alongside Matsumura, Yung, J\u00fcnger and Leite during the Next Block Expo in Berlin. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nJ\u00fcnger echoes these sentiments by highlighting the deflationary mechanism of the Bitcoin protocol and that there\u2019s never talk of halving the fiat money supply.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just such a foreign concept to everything with fiat money that every time it occurs, it\u2019s just such a celebration of we\u2019re doing something completely different here.\u201d\n\nYung provides another interesting perspective, noting that while Animoca Brands has just two projects that directly work in the Bitcoin ecosystem out of some 500 investments, the preeminent blockchain remains \u201cvery impactful\u201d in what it does.\n\nThe Animoca CEO says the effect is similar to any business where interest rates, employment figures and other big macroeconomic signals have an impact even if they\u2019re not directly impacting you.\n\n\u201cSo, for us, I think Bitcoin is our central bank. With that in mind, I think of Ethereum as our investment bank.\u201d\n\nAfter all these years, I finally met @mikojava IRL when we got a chance to do a panel today at @nextblockexpo in Berlin. TL;DR? We're emerging from the bear market, and the honey badger is getting fat (ask Miko). pic.twitter.com/h0PslG3DK9 \u2014 Robby Yung \u29bf\u29bf\u29bf (@viewfromhk) December 5, 2023\n\nBitcoin ETFs and consumer protection\n\nThe pending approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States is being widely cited as a significant driver of BTC\u2019s recent appreciation in value into the mid $40,000 range. Yung offers a very short takeaway as to why this is the case:\n\n\u201cThe potential income from bitcoin ETFs is estimated to be $10 to $12 billion.\u201d\n\nFor an exchange like Binance, the potential for an immediate price spike is another important consideration that could test the systems of a number of global exchange operators.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of events are critical in running the exchange. It\u2019s a matter of succeed or fail in terms of providing the underlying infrastructure when the news goes out and you see that green wick,\u201d J\u00fcnger explains.\n\nRelated: Binance is now \u2018totally different\u2019: Interview with CEO Richard Teng\n\nBinance\u2019s regional director adds that consumer protection is set to fundamentally change with the provision of a spot Bitcoin ETF, which provides a compelling proposition that will drive investment into the asset class:\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, with this ETF vehicle, you will no longer have synthetic financial instruments that reflect the price of Bitcoin. You have an actual spot. It\u2019s all secured. It\u2019s all in custody.\u201d\n\nA cautious approach\n\nWhile there is a sense of euphoria and talk of crypto winter beginning to thaw, Leite offers a sobering perspective given Polkastarter\u2019s role in incubating and guiding cryptocurrency startups through a tough two years.\n\n\u201cDuring the bull market euphoria, a lot of companies overspent; they didn\u2019t build a treasury, which is super important,\u201d Leite explains. While those that have survived are looking ahead to better times, he advocates for a cautious approach:\n\n\u201cWe still advise them not to mind that everyone is excited. You must have a long-term intelligence; make sure that you have a runway for a few years.\u201d\n\nThe recent enforcement action against Binance and its subsequent $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department was also described as a positive development for the wider industry that assuages any fears of the future operations of the world\u2019s largest exchange by transaction volume.\n\nMagazine: The truth behind Cuba\u2019s Bitcoin revolution: An on-the-ground report"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin has continued its surge this week and is now trading for just under $44,000 a nearly 16% rise over the week. In the past month, it\u2019s up 25%\u2014enough of a jump that \u201cdigital gold\u201d has now flipped Meta to become the world\u2019s ninth most valuable asset by market capitalization.\n\nBut this is just the beginning, according to the analysts who spoke with Decrypt.\n\nThe asset\u2019s current movements are \u201ctypical of bull markets\u201d\u2014just like the one of 2020, Amberdata\u2019s director of derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe reason for the quick price action, he added, is mainly down to excitement surrounding the potential launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF): every day, news drops about the process of the long-awaited investment vehicle.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence and Grayscale analysts have said that it\u2019s just a matter of time before a Bitcoin ETF finally hits the U.S. market. If it happens, a Bitcoin ETF would at last provide an easy way for traditional investors to gain exposure to BTC without directly buying and holding digital coins\u2014something that promises to bring an influx of fresh capital to Bitcoin.\n\nBut it isn't just ETF hype driving the rally; there are other factors at play. The prospect of falling interest rates\u2014which stood at historic highs last year and are soon expected to drop\u2014are helping, too.\n\n\u201cFundamentally speaking, lower interest rates helps Bitcoin gain value as well, since the opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin (a non-interest bearing asset) is diminished,\u201d said Magadini.\n\nThe U.S. central bank last year started aggressively hiking interest rates to get sky-high inflation under control. The actions had a negative impact on risk-on assets like stocks and crypto, which typically experience big price movements. That\u2019s because as interest rates rise, and money in a sense becomes more expensive to borrow, investors are more likely to hold onto their dollars instead of parking them in stocks or other similar assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the beast might be tamed: Last week, Fed governor Christopher J. Waller said he was \u201cincreasingly confident\u201d things were on the right track, hinting that the central bank might start slashing rates soon.\n\nAnd this is likely working in Bitcoin\u2019s favor, OANDA senior market analyst Craig Erlam told Decrypt.\n\nAnd big money from institutional investors is helping push up the price, Messari research analyst Toe Bautista told Decrypt\u2014noting that the nearly $20 billion in total futures open interest for Bitcoin is closing in on the peak levels of November 2021.\n\n\u201cThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) leads this trend with an open interest of $5.1 billion, suggesting strong institutional engagement, as evidenced by the increase in options\u2019 open interest and inflows into traditional financial crypto instruments reaching yearly highs,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, where does it go from here? As Decrypt previously reported, analysts say that a recession next year or spot Bitcoin ETF denials could slow things down and reverse gains.\n\nBut experts are optimistic. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen before, once Bitcoin gets moving, it can be hard to stop,\u201d OANDA's Erlam said.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

Having faced unprecedented challenges and many powerful and vocal proponents to its uses and use cases with the latest being JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who stated he is deeply opposed to crypto. His argument being the same as countless others who attribute crime, money laundering and tax evasion which is ironic considering the US dollars role in crime across the globe. A story for another time.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin does have its vocal supporters with the likes of ARKS Cathy Wood and MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor. The failure of US banks this year may have been a blessing in disguise for the crypto industry. There are still clouds hovering over the industry, but this is becoming a normality with market participants hardly taking notice anymore, or so it may seem.\n\nBlackRock announce seed funding for Spot ETF of $100k which is small but it is just a first step with cash likely to change hands a lot quicker once an approval occurs. This shows commitment by BlackRock is ensuring that they are ready for a potential approval.\n\nBitcoin price outlook\n\nFrom a technical standpoint BTCUSD is approaching a key area of resistance around the $45k mark. However, options markets are hinting that Bitcoin will hit $50k by January with the Spot Bitcoin ETF expected to be approved early in January as well.

        "content": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 05, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (TSX-V: DMGI) (OTCQB US: DMGGF) (FRANKFURT: 6AX) (\u201cDMG\u201d), a vertically integrated blockchain and cryptocurrency technology company, announces it has signed an agreement with Bitmain Technologies to purchase 4,550 T21 190 TH/s bitcoin miners for US$12,103,000 (US$14/TH/s). Financing of the purchase may be through existing cash/liquidated bitcoin, debt or a combination of both.\n\n\n\nDMG Purchases Bitmain T21 Bitcoin Miners for up to 1 EH/s of New Hashrate\n\nDMG expects shipment of its T21 miners in the March quarter of 2024; terms of the purchase are 10% downpayment (already paid) with the balance due in the month prior to shipment. As the T21 natively supports a high-energy (overclocked) mode to 233 TH/s (with a modest decrease in efficiency from 19 J/TH to 22 J/TH), which DMG expects to utilize, the Company may be able to realize from this purchase up to 1.06 EH/s (subject to equipment receipt, installation and full operation), which is comparable with DMG\u2019s current hashrate. Delivery to DMG\u2019s Christina Lake data center facility is subject to change given macro factors including but not limited to shipping logistics and customs processing.\n\nDMG is planning to utilize its previously purchased mining containers, which are in the process of being installed at its Christina Lake facility in advance of taking delivery of the T21 miners. This new fleet, in combination with expected rationalization of its existing fleet, will help DMG improve its overall fleet efficiency anticipated to be below 25 J/TH post-halvening, which is expected in April 2024.\n\nNovember 2023 Preliminary Mining Results\n\nIn November 2023, DMG mined 64.7 bitcoin with 0.97 EH/s realized hashrate. DMG\u2019s bitcoin balance as of November 30, 2023 was 429 bitcoin. DMG exited November with 1.07 EH/s of realized hashrate. The Company is working to improve the operation of its fleet so that its realized hashrate is closer to its fleet nameplate hashrate of 1.2 EH/s in the coming months.\n\nAbout DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc.\n\nDMG is an environmentally friendly vertically integrated blockchain and cryptocurrency company that manages, operates, and develops end-to-end digital solutions to monetize the blockchain ecosystem. DMG\u2019s sustainable businesses are segmented into two business lines under the Core and Core+ strategies and unified through DMG\u2019s vertical integration.\n\nFor more information on DMG Blockchain Solutions visit: www.dmgblockchain.com\n\nFollow @dmgblockchain on Twitter and subscribe to DMG\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors,\n\nSheldon Bennett, CEO & Director\n\nTel: 516-222-2560\n\nEmail: investors@dmgblockchain.com\n\nWeb: www.dmgblockchain.com\n\nInvestor Relations Contact\n\nCORE IR 516-222-2560\n\nFor Media Inquiries\n\nJules Abraham\n\nCORE IR\n\n917-885-7378\n\njulesa@coreir.com\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Service Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking information or statements based on current expectations.

        "content": "\u00bb This card is no longer available\n\nYou can no longer apply for the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Visa\u00ae Credit Card , so this page is out of date.\n\nThe investing information provided on this page is for educational purposes only. NerdWallet, Inc. does not offer advisory or brokerage services, nor does it recommend or advise investors to buy or sell particular stocks, securities or other investments.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nThe Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Visa\u00ae Credit Card is one of multiple cards offered by the financial startup Upgrade. It works like a credit card and personal loan all in one, allowing you to make purchases and then pay down your balance in equal monthly installments for a set period of time with a fixed interest rate.\n\nBut that's not its only distinctive trait: The card also earns 1.5% back in the form of bitcoin when you make your monthly payments, another product among a growing trend of credit cards that offer cryptocurrency rewards.\n\nThere are some limits on those bitcoin-based rewards, though, and a 1.5% rewards rate itself isn't spectacular. But the key with crypto isn't necessarily the upfront earn rate, but rather the potential appreciation of those rewards later.\n\nOf course, it's worth noting that crypto values can also fall, but for anyone looking to dip their toes into bitcoin, the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Visa\u00ae Credit Card is a low-barrier way \u2014 especially when the risk is limited to credit card rewards and not, say, money sitting in your traditional bank account.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Upgrade's portfolio also includes the Upgrade Cash Rewards Visa\u00ae and the Upgrade Triple Cash Rewards Visa\u00ae. For information on how these cards differ, see our comparison table below.\n\nUpgrade Bitcoin Rewards Visa\u00ae Credit Card: The basics\n\nCard type: Rewards, cryptocurrency.\n\nAnnual fee: $0 .\n\nSign-up bonus: None.\n\nOngoing rewards: Earn 1.5% unlimited cash back in bitcoin when you make payments.\n\nAPR: The ongoing APR is 14.99%-29.99% .\n\nForeign transaction fees: 3%.\n\nBalance transfer fee: 5%.\n\nOther facts and benefits:\n\nNo security deposit required.\n\nGet pre-approved without hurting your credit scores.\n\nPay down balances at a fixed interest rate with equal monthly payments.\n\nUse your credit line as a personal loan by requesting funds be sent directly to your bank account.\n\nNo prepayment penalty, late fees or penalty APR.\n\nReports to all three major credit bureaus.\n\nHow the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Visa\u00ae Credit Card works\n\nYou can use the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Visa\u00ae Credit Card in two ways:\n\nAs a credit card: Make purchases in stores or online, wherever Visa cards are accepted. Your balance is converted to an installment loan at a fixed interest rate, which you can repay in equal monthly payments over a set period.\n\nAs a personal loan: Request that funds be sent directly to your bank account. You can pay back the loan in equal monthly installments over a set period with a fixed interest rate and a 5% cash advance fee. Note that you cannot get a cash advance at an ATM using this card.\n\nYou earn 1.5% back in bitcoin rewards as you make payments on your card balance. Earned bitcoin rewards are held in a wallet provided by NYDIG, a custody and trading platform.\n\nThe ongoing APR is 14.99%-29.99% , and most applicants can qualify for credit lines ranging from $500 to $25,000 (though some may be granted credit lines as high at $50,000).\n\nWhich Upgrade card is right for you?\n\nThe Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Visa\u00ae Credit Card is one of a collection of cards offered by the financial startup Upgrade. Other cards include the Upgrade Cash Rewards Visa\u00ae and Upgrade Triple Cash Rewards Visa\u00ae, which earn cash-back rewards. All three cards are available to applicants with average to excellent credit, while applicants who are working to improve their credit may qualify for a version of the card that doesn\u2019t offer rewards.\n\nThe key difference among the cards is their rewards structure.

        "content": "In a recent Bloomberg report, it has been suggested that the rise of Bitcoin price to over $42,000 is just the beginning of a new crypto super cycle that will push the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency to over $500,000.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, proponents of this theory argue that Bitcoin represents a new monetary order that is captivating Wall Street and fueling a \u201cpalpable sense of euphoria\u201d within the digital asset community.\n\nBitcoin Price Potential Soars\n\nThe remarkable performance of the Bitcoin price in recent months took many by surprise, as the cryptocurrency posted three consecutive monthly increases, including another 11 percent in December alone.\n\nThe enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s price rally has led to optimistic predictions of further gains, often based on intuition or technical analysis.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has experienced a significant price revival in 2023, with its value surging over 150% thus far. Market observers attribute this surge to growing anticipation of a potential approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for trading in the United States.\n\nPer the report, the prospect of an ETF has led to jubilation within the industry. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong suggests that \u201cBitcoin may be the key to extending Western civilization.\u201d Forecasts regarding the future price of Bitcoin have ranged from $50,000 in the immediate term to above $530,000.\n\nMatt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co., cautions about the rapidly changing sentiment in the asset class, highlighting the importance of the liquidity influx caused by the pandemic in driving Bitcoin\u2019s strong rally in 2020 and 2021.\n\nMaley suggests that without a similar liquidity injection, some of the optimistic predictions surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s future value may be unrealistic.\n\nThe long-awaited launch of a Bitcoin-based ETF in the United States aims to facilitate easier access to the cryptocurrency for money managers, potentially attracting billions of dollars in new investments to the space.\n\nBTC ETF Speculation Sparks Optimism\n\nResearchers at Kaiko note a noticeable shift in the market sentiment since mid-October, driven by increasing institutional interest in the potential approval of a spot BTC ETF and a more favorable macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe researchers also highlight recent inflows into crypto investment products and a seven-month high in daily spot-trading volumes in November.\n\nNevertheless, while excitement about a broader crypto rally often spreads across social media platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), it is important to acknowledge Bitcoin\u2019s historical volatility.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the cryptocurrency has experienced multiple hype cycles in recent years, with celebrated gains followed by significant downturns.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s recent gains and departure from a prolonged consolidation phase, Bloomberg suggests that a significant correction may still be on the horizon. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $41,800, displaying sustained bullish momentum as it strives to reclaim the $42,000 level.\n\nThe outcome remains uncertain whether the cryptocurrency will successfully consolidate above this critical level, positioning it favorably for continued upward movement throughout the month.\n\nAlternatively, the current yearly high level could act as a formidable resistance barrier for the Bitcoin price, further supporting Bloomberg\u2019s thesis of a potential correction.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "6th December 2023 \u2013 Following the success of their second annual Plan \u20bf Forum, the City of Lugano, in collaboration with Tether Operations Limited (Tether), announced today that the city will now accept Bitcoin and Tether Tokens (USDt) as payment for all municipal transactions, such as taxes and fees.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency payments in the Swiss city were previously reserved for transactions made on Lugano\u2019s online portal, today\u2019s announcement means that city residents can now pay all city invoices with Bitcoin and USDt without exceptions or limits on amounts. All previously issued and currently outstanding municipal invoices can also be paid with Bitcoin and USDt.\n\nThese new payment options are available through Lugano\u2019s existing system of municipal payments. City residents and companies simply have to scan the corresponding QR code printed on the invoices, and they will be presented with the seamless and fully automated feature of settling their bill with Bitcoin or USDt.\n\n\u201cLugano\u2019s Plan \u20bf is working, period. It fills me with pride to see Lugano continue to embrace the promise of Bitcoin and blockchain technology to make life more convenient and more prosperous for its residents. I look forward to watching Lugano continue to grow as a blockchain hub for the region, and seeing more communities around the globe follow Lugano\u2019s example of innovation and economic liberty,\u201d said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether.\n\nThis initiative comes as part of Lugano\u2019s strategic Plan \u20bf initiative with Tether, the largest cryptocurrency company in the world. In October of this year, Lugano and Tether hosted the Plan \u20bf Forum, a gathering of cryptocurrency enthusiasts and thought leaders, which welcomed 2,200 participants from over 50 nations. The forum was a resounding success, with over 350 retailers in Lugano adopting crypto payments and over 1,500 transactions being made using Bitcoin and Tether, reinforcing the global adoption of Bitcoin and the ongoing crusade for financial empowerment.\n\nThe city\u2019s forward-thinking approach extends beyond taxes. All tickets, merchandise, food, and beverages at FC Lugano football matches will soon also be purchased with Bitcoin and USDt, thanks to the partnership between Plan \u20bf and FC Lugano .\n\nThe City of Lugano and Tether are also working on several other initiatives, including a centrally located specialized hub for blockchain companies and startups, and scholarships for students interested in learning about blockchain development at local universities.\n\nLugano\u2019s embrace of cryptocurrency is expected to reduce infrastructure costs, expand accessibility to global financial markets, and improve the transparency of products and services offered to its citizens. The city aims to become a model for real-world, daily blockchain usage on a wide scale.\n\nFor more information, visit https://www.lugano.ch/ and https://tether.to/.\n\nAbout Plan \u20bf\n\nLugano\u2019s Plan \u20bf is a joint initiative between the City of Lugano and Tether to accelerate the use of and leverage bitcoin technology as the foundation to transform the city\u2019s financial infrastructure.\n\nThe plan will scale blockchain and Bitcoin throughout the city to positively impact all facets of daily life for the residents of Lugano. From small transactions with local merchants to larger efforts \u2013 such as paying annual taxes \u2013 blockchain will serve as the foundation for the city\u2019s financial exchanges."
