        "content": "Climate Pledges vs. Bitcoin Investments: Unveiling the $1.5 Billion Dollar Climate Bomb\n\nClick here for the full report\n\nWashington, DC (July 11, 2023)\u2013Greenpeace USA\u2019s new report exposes the financial institutions driving Bitcoin\u2019s climate destruction.\n\nBlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, CitiGroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Visa, Mastercard, and American Express have collectively invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin mining, along with providing numerous services and investments to their customers, the report finds. Investing in Bitcoin\u2019s Climate Pollution: Big Finance is Betting on Dirty Bitcoin, released today, finds that these companies\u2019 Bitcoin investments contradict their climate commitments and the demands of science and justice.\n\nBitcoin, referred to by some as a \u201cclimate bomb,\u201d devours energy at an alarming scale, rivaling nations like Chile and Denmark; most of this energy comes from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. Coal-fired power plants slated to be closed have been kept open or even reopened to power bitcoin mining. Financial institutions are accelerating the clock on this carbon time bomb by collectively investing over $1.5 billion dollars in the mining industry and mainstreaming broader adoption. Bitcoin\u2019s climate pollution needs to be addressed immediately before it becomes a bigger problem.\n\nJoshua Archer, Greenpeace USA\u2019s Bitcoin Project Lead, said: \u201cThere is no CEO of Bitcoin. But JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock, and all of the companies we investigated have the power and resources to push for a change to the code that would eliminate nearly 100% of Bitcoin\u2019s energy use. This is a rare opportunity to eliminate a massive amount of fossil fuel use without needing to replace it with another energy source. But instead of calling for this common sense change and leading us toward a green future, financial institutions are making a risky gamble on Bitcoin at the expense of climate and communities. By investing in mining companies, creating new avenues for Bitcoin transactions, and building new services to bring Bitcoin to a broader clientele, they are operating in contradiction with their own climate pledges. We invite them and other stakeholders to the table to plot a future for Bitcoin that\u2019s compatible with a just, habitable planet for all.\u201d\n\nAll nine companies have made climate pledges or set ESG goals, yet all fail to address the glaring pollution problem posed by Bitcoin. Some have even publicly criticized Bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact, but continue to discreetly invest in and expand their Bitcoin portfolios.\n\nTo learn more about the role of financial institutions in supporting Bitcoin\u2019s climate problem, read Greenpeace USA\u2019s Report here.\n\nOur scorecard ranked asset manager BlackRock and bank JP Morgan Chase as the worst when it comes to Bitcoin. Both emerged as prominent supporters of Bitcoin by actively investing in mining companies and Bitcoin investment products. Despite their sustainability commitments to reduce carbon emissions, neither company has taken action to address Bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact.\n\nGreenpeace USA\u2019s investigation exposed a glaring contradiction, as influential figures like Blackrock CEO Larry Fink and JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who have both denounced Bitcoin and claimed to be climate champions, are now deeply entrenched in substantial Bitcoin investments. At the World Economic Forum in January 2023, Dimon famously mocked cryptocurrency as a \u201cwaste of time\u201d and Bitcoin as a \u201cdecentralized Ponzi scheme\u201d and a \u201chyped-up fraud.\u201d That these key players have embraced Bitcoin raises serious concerns about the integrity and seriousness of the financial service industry\u2019s commitment to addressing climate change.\n\nArcher added: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to have ESG goals and climate pledges \u2014 financial institutions must enforce them and live up to their promises. These financial institutions should follow through on their commitments and take responsibility for the significant consequences their business operations have in the real world. The impact of their inaction on pressing issues like Bitcoin\u2019s pollution problem can be far-reaching and contribute to more severe climate change.\u201d\n\nIf these C-suite executives genuinely prioritize combating the climate emergency and achieving their net-zero emission targets, it is imperative for them to acknowledge publicly the issue at hand. Greenpeace USA calls on them to push for fundamental changes in Bitcoin\u2019s code, ensuring it becomes a force for positive change rather than a contributor to climate degradation. By taking a stand, they can demonstrate true leadership in aligning financial power with environmental stewardship.\n\nMultiple attempts were made to contact executives from all nine financial institutions. Visa, Mastercard, BlackRock, and CitiGroup were willing to engage in conversations about Bitcoin pollution, but to date these discussions have yielded limited results. Fidelity, Vanguard, JPMorgan Chase, American Express, and Goldman Sachs ignored or refused Greenpeace USA\u2019s efforts to engage them on this issue.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe methodology involved selecting financial companies from the banking, asset management, and payment processing sectors based on their involvement with Bitcoin, considering their size and influence in the industry. The report examined investments and exposure through share and bond holdings in Bitcoin mining companies and the provision of services and products related to Bitcoin. Data was collected from public filings, news sources, and Bloomberg Terminal. The report acknowledges the challenges of tracking Bitcoin investments and quantifying the scope and size of Bitcoin-related services.\n\n###\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Greenpeace USA Senior Communications Specialist, [email protected], 631-404-9977\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nLAGOS, PORTUGAL \u2014 In the small coastal town of Lagos in the heart of Portugal's southern Algarve region, Didi Taihuttu begins most days on the rooftop of his villa \u2014 an unassuming home with rustic charm set atop a hill that slopes up from the Atlantic Ocean. The Mediterranean sun bounces off the bright white stucco walls of the house, illuminating the orange terracotta roof and casting a glow over Taihuttu, who sits on a plastic chair tucked under a round table of the same make. The Dutch patriarch of the Bitcoin Family drinks black coffee and pores over cryptocurrency price charts on his MacBook Pro as he decides which trades will begin his day. \"We just need a few thousand per month to live on so our performance is not really important to us,\" Taihuttu tells CNBC from his deck overlooking an expansive stretch of cobalt-colored water, cliff-backed beaches and bougainvillea.\n\nTaihuttu's family home in Lagos, Portugal. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nTaihuttu's self-effacement and modest surroundings belie the 45-year-old's success. In 2017, Taihuttu, along with his wife and three kids, liquidated all their assets, trading a 2,500-square-foot house and most of their earthly possessions for bitcoin and a life on the road. This was back when the price of bitcoin was about $900. Bitcoin is currently trading at over $30,000, down from an all-time high of nearly $70,000 in November 2021. Those extreme price swings have helped grow the Dutch family's crypto nest egg. For seven years, the investor has regularly been swapping his bitcoin for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins to capitalize on the volatility in the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency. When Taihuttu thinks bitcoin is reaching a bull market peak, he trades his bitcoin into stablecoins such as tether, USDC and DAI. When it appears as though bitcoin is touching cycle lows during a bear market, he starts buying it back. So far, Taihuttu says the gamble is working out great thanks to a market indicator he created himself dubbed the Didi BAM BAM.\n\nDidi Taihuttu in Lagos, Portugal. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nTaihuttu's indicator considers a mix of inputs, including directional trading data and moon cycles. It has guided all of Taihuttu's investing decisions since he built it before the Covid-19 pandemic. \"From mid-November to the start of December 2022, we saw the first signs the bear market was completely over,\" said Taihuttu. \"It was confirmed in January 2023 when the long flag appeared in the model.\" He added, \"People should have been buying bitcoin already, because every bitcoin you bought at $16k, it's at $30k now, so that's almost 90% upside.\" The father of three says his bitcoin investment is up about 50% since the bottom of the most recent bear market. The Taihuttus declined to share with CNBC the current dollar amount of their crypto investment in aggregate. But Taihuttu did disclose that they had fully bought back into bitcoin by the time the coin surpassed the $19,000 price threshold, so they're \"not doing so bad.\" It also helps that the nomadic family's primary domicile is in Portugal \u2014 Europe's ultimate crypto tax haven. \"You don't pay any capital gains tax or anything else in Portugal on cryptocurrency,\" said Taihuttu. \"As long as you don't earn cryptocurrency for providing services in Portugal, you're in the clear.\" \"That's a very beautiful bitcoin heaven,\" he said.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Didi Taihuttu in Lagos, Portugal. Didi Taihuttu\n\nHow the BAM BAM indicator works\n\nWhen Taihuttu began day trading tokens, he initially turned to traditional predictive metrics such as the stock-to-flow model and the Mayer Multiple \u2014 a measure calculated by dividing the current price of bitcoin by the 200-day moving average to help identify frothy moments in the market when an asset's value eclipses its intrinsic value. But spending the time reading the tea leaves of all these somewhat-related measures didn't seem like a particularly productive use of his time, so Taihuttu decided to create his own proprietary blend of the best indicators on the market. \"It's not just enough to know which indicators go into a formula,\" explained Taihuttu. \"What you can't see is the calculus and the code that implements over the stock conditions. Those calculations display in charts.\" Beginning in 2019, Taihuttu started to incubate and perfect a custom-built predictive trading tool that would weigh multiple technical indicators \u2014 plus a bit of astrology \u2014 and then spit out real-time insights into potential price swings. \"It's a combination of Bollinger Bands, Lower and Upper Bands, NMA, Red/Green Ribbon, NormStoch, RSI, Price Oscillator, Plot, MACD, Cross, Chande Momentum Oscillator, RSI-EMA, Full Moon and New Moon,\" explained Taihuttu, naming a dozen of the most popular market signals that crypto traders watch when they make investment decisions. \"Short and long signals and confirmation signals are shown on the charts when it could be a great moment to buy or sell,\" continued Taihuttu.\n\nThe Taihuttu family in Lagos, Portugal. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of the technicals that underlie the model: Bollinger Bands focus on price volatility over time.

Didi Taihuttu\n\nThen there are the intangible price influencers such as moon phases. \"I'm not saying it always affects the price of bitcoin, but the moon influences a lot,\" said Taihuttu. Taihuttu has found that when there is a full moon or a half moon, people tend to trade more. \"They tend to buy more, they tend to sell more,\" he said. \"Maybe it's a coincidence, but if you look at the chart, you can see that mostly at the full moon, depending on where we are in the cycle, there's a dump or a pump.\" Taihuttu added that the lunar phases also typically sync with the opening and closing of bitcoin's monthly puts and options. \"So, if we are in the top of the Bollinger Band in combination with a full moon, then you know that we are going to run,\" continued Taihuttu, suggesting a market sell-off is imminent.\n\nLosing his edge to ChatGPT\n\nTaihuttu used to sell the Didi BAM BAM indicator to traders but says he will soon give the trading tool away to selected bitcoin evangelists to help spur adoption. But he also admits his business model is disappearing. \"Anyone in the world can now go into ChatGPT and tell them, 'Write me an indicator based on the moving averages and this cycle or that cycle. And write me a script that I can implement into TradingView and then they can make their own indicators,''\" explained Taihuttu. \"I'm losing business there.\"\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards The \"Bitcoin Family\" in Thailand. Didi Taihuttu\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence is a specific form of AI that is able to produce content from scratch. The systems take inputs from the user and feed them into powerful algorithms fueled by large datasets to generate new text, images and video in a way that can appear almost human-like. AI captured the spotlight following widespread public adoption of OpenAI's GPT language processing technology. ChatGPT, which uses massive language models to create human-sounding responses to questions, has ignited an arms race among some companies over what is seen as the next \"paradigm shift\" in tech. While ChatGPT isn't able to deliver a querent a trading algorithm in Pine Script, which is TradingView's programming language, the technology does challenge the role of investment advisers. In March, Goldman Sachs' chief information officer, Marco Argenti, told CNBC the bank is experimenting with generative AI tools internally to help its developers automatically generate and test code. More recently, in May, Goldman spun off the first startup from the bank's internal incubator \u2013 an AI-powered social media company for corporate use called Louisa. The push into AI is part of a larger effort by CEO David Solomon to expedite the bank's digital makeover. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, is using it to inform its financial advisors on queries they may have. The bank has been testing an OpenAI-powered chatbot with 300 advisors so far, with a view to ultimately aid its roughly 16,000 advisors in making use of Morgan Stanley's repository of research and data, according to Jeff McMillan, head of analytics and data at the firm's wealth management division. Taihuttu uses ChatGPT himself, but more for writing articles about subjects such as bitcoin and the Lightning Network. But he notes that while it is a productivity hack, the output doesn't necessarily rank highly in search results. \"They will still find out that it's ChatGPT,\" he says. \"But it's still saving you a lot of time.\" \u2014 CNBC's Ryan Browne contributed to this report."

        "content": "It\u2019s time to party like it\u2019s 2021! Or it feels that way if you put faith in a new report by Standard Chartered, a U.K. multinational bank that predicts the price of Bitcoin will climb to $50,000 this year and all the way to $120,000 by the end of 2024. The figures are an upward revision of an earlier bullish report by the bank and would amount to a 300% jump from its current price of around $30,000.\n\nI confess it\u2019s fun to write this\u2014if only because, after 18 months, one gets tired of reporting on regulatory crackdowns, collapsing prices, and the arrest of leading industry figures. In light of recent events, it\u2019s worth remembering crypto is not some scam but a 15-year-old project whose most high-profile asset\u2014Bitcoin\u2014is receiving bullish endorsements from major banks. (Goldman Sachs predicted $100,000 Bitcoin in early 2022.)\n\nI\u2019ve covered this industry for a decade now and believe two things are true. First, things are never as good as they seem during the bull markets\u2014blockchain is never going to transform humanity\u2014but nor are things as bad as they seem during bear markets.\n\nSecond, the price floor for Bitcoin (and possibly Ethereum) during a downturn will always be higher than the previous one. For instance, the price sunk to around $16,000 following the FTX debacle last year. Compare that with $3,000 after the popping of the 2017 bubble or $300 in 2014 after the Mt. Gox hack.\n\nI\u2019m not saying this price floor trend is a new Moore\u2019s Law. Only that it\u2019s much easier to imagine Bitcoin at $120,000 than at $10,000. Meanwhile, take note the analyst gnomes at Standard Chartered aren\u2019t pulling figures out of thin air, but are basing their prediction on a sensible thesis.\n\nThe thesis is that Bitcoin miners are making more profits, so they will sell fewer of the tokens they mine to raise cash. Fewer tokens dumped on the market means more scarcity, and that means higher prices. This scarcity trend is also going to accelerate during the next \u201chalving\u201d event in 2024, which will see the number of new Bitcoins minted every day drop from around 900 to more like 450. By the time that occurs, a lot of the scarcity will be priced in, but until then it\u2019s easy to see how the price will climb.\n\nSo will Bitcoin reach $120,000 by Dec. 31, 2024? I have no idea. Plenty of things could happen before then to deliver a major price shock to the crypto markets. Imagine, for instance, if Tether depegged or Binance collapsed or governments came together to bank crypto. But for now, the bank\u2019s prediction looks like a sound one\u2014and it\u2019s more likely the party will begin over again than get shut down for good.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCoinbase shares continue to soar in light of BlackRock's recent ETF Bitcoin application, but several analysts have expressed skepticism that the SEC will grant it.

        "title": "Is Bitcoin Really Digital Gold? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Within the cryptocurrency industry, Bitcoin has earned the moniker \"digital gold,\" drawing comparisons with the actual precious metal. But the issue remains: Is Bitcoin truly the digital counterpart of gold? In this post, we will look at the features of both Bitcoin and gold to see if the comparison holds up under investigation.\n\nThe Emergence of Bitcoin as a Store of Value\n\nBitcoin debuted in 2009 as an experimental digital money based on blockchain technology. It has evolved from an intriguing notion to a recognized asset class over time. Comparisons of Bitcoin and gold as value storage have gained popularity, with numerous important elements contributing to this impression.\n\nLimited Stock: One essential feature that Bitcoin and gold have in common is their limited quantity. Gold shortage is well-known, with the global gold supply limited and difficult to considerably expand. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is programmed with a maximum quantity of 21 million coins, creating digital scarcity.\n\nDecentralization: Both assets operate via decentralized networks. Gold is not controlled by any single entity or government. Similarly, Bitcoin runs on a decentralized blockchain, which limits the influence of central authorities.\n\nWhen compared to actual gold, Bitcoin's digital nature provides it extraordinary portability. The convenience of transferring Bitcoin across borders and conducting digital transactions outweighs the difficulties of dealing with actual gold.\n\nBitcoin is divisible, allowing it to be divided into smaller parts and hence accommodate microtransactions. Gold, on the other hand, is typically exchanged in bigger denominations.\n\nInflation Hedging: Bitcoin and gold are frequently used as inflation and economic instability hedges. During times of economic instability, investors commonly turn to both assets to protect and maintain their money.\n\nThe Similarities of Bitcoin and Gold\n\nThe idea of Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" is supported by various similarities between the two assets:\n\nScarce Supply: Both Bitcoin and gold are based on the concept of scarcity. For millennia, gold's scarcity in the Earth's crust has been known, whereas Bitcoin's mathematical restriction of 21 million coins instills digital scarcity.\n\nBitcoin and gold both have a reputation for being safe-haven assets. Investors frequently flock to them during economic downturns and to protect their capital from the corrosive effects of inflation.\n\nDecentralization: The decentralized nature of Bitcoin's blockchain, as well as the lack of centralized authority, contribute to the perception of its independence from state influence.\n\nBitcoin and gold both derive their value from their fundamental properties. The attractiveness of gold is due to its shine, conductivity, and historical significance, but the value of Bitcoin is due to its cryptographic technology, decentralization, and usability as a digital money.\n\nBitcoin and Gold Distinctions\n\nHowever, it's crucial to grasp the features that define Bitcoin apart from gold:\n\nKeep Reading South Africa Navigates Crypto Regulations: To License 60 Firms This Month\n\nPhysical vs. Digital: Perhaps the most evident contrast is the materiality of gold and the digital nature of Bitcoin. Gold exists in the actual world, requiring secure storage and transit, but Bitcoin is a fully digital asset, stored in virtual wallets.\n\nTangibility: Gold is a physical item with a millennia-long history of being utilized in jewelry, industry, and currency. Bitcoin lacks this tactile existence and is just a digital ledger entry.\n\nIndustrial and Decorative Use: Gold serves practical applications in numerous industries and is loved for its ornamental appeal. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no industrial use and is not utilized for decoration.\n\nVolatility: Bitcoin's price volatility outperforms gold's. While this volatility provides trading opportunities, it also increases investor risk.\n\nRegulatory Environment: Bitcoin operates in a constantly changing regulatory environment. Governments throughout the world are debating how to classify and regulate cryptocurrencies, but gold faces less regulatory hurdles.\n\nIs It Too Soon to Call BTC Digital Gold?\n\nBitcoin has been trading steadily around the $35,000 level, while the broader cryptocurrency market saw some ups and downs.\n\nSome are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a potential hedge, akin to traditional assets like gold, against the backdrop of economic uncertainty. The growing understanding of the United States' dire fiscal situation and Bitcoin's role as a hedge is driving this sentiment. With the U.S. national debt exceeding $33 trillion and unfunded liabilities amounting to around $170 trillion, the need for quantitative easing, or money printing, is inevitable, potentially leading to the devaluation of the dollar. In this environment, Bitcoin is seen as \"gold 2.0,\" providing protection against these financial headwinds.\n\nWhile Bitcoin's status as a hedge is gaining traction, the cryptocurrency market remains volatile. Traders continue to take profits after a broader crypto rally, leading to fluctuations in various tokens. Despite the volatility, some believe the overall outlook for Bitcoin and the crypto market is promising.\n\nWhile Bitcoin may still face pullbacks and volatility, the idea of it as \"digital gold\" is gaining momentum, with some seeing it as a key asset to hedge against uncertain economic times. Whether it can fully live up to this role remains to be seen, but Bitcoin's resilience and continued presence in the financial landscape indicate that the debate is far from over.\n\nConclusion\n\nFinally, the comparison of Bitcoin and gold as stores of value is based on their similar qualities, such as restricted supply, decentralization, mobility, divisibility, and roles as inflation hedges. Differences between the two assets include materiality, tangibility, industrial application, volatility, and regulatory monitoring.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has characteristics similar to gold's attractiveness, it remains a distinct digital entity charting its own way in the world of finance and investing. Investors and enthusiasts should approach both assets with an appreciation of their unique characteristics and roles in a diversified portfolio.\n\nThe discussion over whether Bitcoin is actually \"digital gold\" is expected to continue, reflecting cryptocurrencies' continued evolution and role in the global economy."

        "title": "Can banks push Bitcoin to clean up its act? - The Verge",
        "content": "It\u2019s time for banks and asset managers to start pushing Bitcoin to clean up its pollution, Greenpeace argues in a new report. The environmental organization wants to see Bitcoin change its code to slash energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. That\u2019s a big ask, but Greenpeace argues that financial institutions could have an outsize influence on the Bitcoin network through its business dealings.\n\n\u201cThe report focused on nine major financial institutions that are providing the glue that keeps the Bitcoin ecosystem together,\u201d says Joshua Archer, who leads Greenpeace USA\u2019s Bitcoin campaign. \u201cFinancial institutions have an important responsibility, but they\u2019re currently ignoring the severity of the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe report focused on nine major financial institutions that are providing the glue that keeps the Bitcoin ecosystem together\u201d\n\nThose financial institutions \u2014 including BlackRock, Vanguard, JPMorgan Chase, and others \u2014 controlled shares in Bitcoin mining companies that were valued at more than $1.35 billion in April 2023, according to Greenpeace\u2019s report. Many of the financial companies are also expanding their services to make it easier for customers to deal in Bitcoin. That could increase the cryptocurrency\u2019s already hefty environmental footprint, the report says. Crypto companies are facing a storm of scrutiny from regulators after FTX\u2019s spectacular collapse. Democrats are also pressing companies on Bitcoin\u2019s impact on power grids and climate goals. Despite those headwinds, Bitcoin\u2019s emissions can still rise every time its price rallies.\n\nBitcoin is by far the most polluting cryptocurrency. That\u2019s not just because it\u2019s the biggest by market cap but because of the way the blockchain validates transactions. Bitcoin miners run data centers full of specialized machines that solve complex puzzles around the clock. They earn new Bitcoin this way, but all that puzzle-solving comes with energy and environmental costs. The cryptocurrency uses about as much electricity annually as the country of Sweden.\n\nGreenpeace isn\u2019t asking these companies to divest from Bitcoin. Instead, it\u2019s pushing for the blockchain to switch to a new way of validating transactions that gets rid of energy-sucking puzzles. That\u2019s what the second most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum, did last year \u2014 drastically slashing its energy consumption and emissions in the process.\n\nThere\u2019s been resistance to do the same thing with Bitcoin, though. Miners have already invested in their equipment and would be hard-pressed to throw it all away, for one. And to make the switch, every node on the network would need to be on board. That\u2019s a tough sell for folks who might have bought into Bitcoin in the first place because it\u2019s supposed to be decentralized \u2014 theoretically free from any single institution telling them what to do.\n\nGreenpeace makes the case that financial institutions actually do hold sway. BlackRock is a leader in the pack when it comes to asset managers\u2019 support for Bitcoin, according to the Greenpeace report. Its shareholdings in 18 Bitcoin mining companies were valued at more than $595 million in April. The report also \u201cdraw[s] a direct line from BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin mining investments to the revival of fossil fuel infrastructure.\u201d For example, BlackRock is the biggest institutional shareholder in Greenidge Generation Holdings, a company that uses a previously shuttered gas power plant almost exclusively to mine Bitcoin.\n\nAmong banks, JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the leading Bitcoin supporter, according to the Greenpeace report. It controlled shares in 17 Bitcoin mining companies valued at more than $26 million in April and offers different products and services to help customers invest in Bitcoin. That contradicts the bank\u2019s goal of helping the world reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the Greenpeace report says. And Chase hasn\u2019t been transparent about whether it includes emissions from Bitcoin in its carbon accounting \u2014 a problem for the financial sector overall, Archer says."

        "title": "ESG Enforcement Emerges as Risk for Oil Firms, Bitcoin Miners - Bloomberg Law",
        "content": "An SEC enforcement initiative targeting misleading ESG disclosures has become a business risk for dozens of public companies, including bankrupt Bitcoin miner Core Scientific, shale oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources and banking giant Ally.\n\nThe Climate and ESG Task Force the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was launched two years ago, was mentioned among the risk factors in 30 companies\u2019 10-K annual reports so far this year with about six months to go, according to a Bloomberg Law review of company filings. That\u2019s double the 15 companies that referenced it in their 10-K risk factors in all of 2022.\n\nThe ramp-up in risk disclosures comes amid a seven-month lull in new cases from the task force. The unit last helped bring a case in November, when the SEC announced an enforcement action and settlement with Goldman Sachs. The matter was one of at least four cases tied to the group.\n\nThe task force is unlikely to stay quiet indefinitely, securities lawyers said. The SEC continues to emphasize environmental, social and governance reporting and is moving to require climate risk disclosures, giving companies reason to alert their shareholders to the special enforcement unit, they said.\n\n\u201cThe sense is that it\u2019s often better to have said something, pointing out a known issue, than to have said nothing at all,\u201d said Amy Greer, a former SEC lawyer and co-chair of Baker & McKenzie LLP\u2019s North American financial regulation and enforcement practice. Greer defended health insurance distributor Benefytt against a task force-assisted case last year.\n\nAn SEC spokesman declined to comment.\n\n\n\n\u2018More Forthcoming\u2019\n\nAlly Financial Inc. , Core Scientific Inc. and another major Bitcoin miner, Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc., were some of the first to bring up the task force in their risk factors when they filed their 10-Ks in February and March of 2022. They were among 15 companies that started mentioning the task force within 13 months of the SEC announcing the 22-member unit in March 2021.\n\nThe task force is an example of more scrutiny and changing expectations from regulators, investors and others on ESG issues, Greenidge and Core Scientific said in their 2022 and 2023 10-Ks. The Bitcoin miners may face additional costs if they don\u2019t adapt to expectations and rules about their electricity usage and other ESG concerns, according to their reports.\n\nBoth Greenidge and Core Scientific rely on at least some carbon-emitting sources for their mining, which requires powerful computers to crack complex equations that garner the companies rewards in cryptocurrency once solved.\n\nGreenidge\u2019s website says that the Bitcoin miner is a \u201cprotector of the environments in which we operate.\u201d The company has battled environmental activists over the natural gas-fired power plant it runs in upstate New York. The state\u2019s Department of Environmental Conservation denied Greenidge\u2019s renewal permit for the facility last year due to greenhouse gas emissions limits, but it remains operational as the company appeals the decision.\n\nAlly in its 2022 and 2023 10-K risk factors listed the task force as an example of how governments are increasingly focusing on climate change, while adding that a majority of its business is connected to auto loans.\n\nPioneer Natural Resources Co. and fellow oil company Devon Energy Corp. were among 19 companies that cited the Climate and ESG Task Force in their 10-K risk factors for the first time in 2023. Most of the companies adding the disclosure this year were in the oil and gas industry.\n\nGovernment officials and others are looking more closely at companies\u2019 emissions reduction targets and other climate goals for instances of greenwashing, Pioneer and Devon said in their 10-Ks. Both companies report emissions data and reduction goals in their sustainability reports. The rise of lawsuits over misleading ESG claims bring \u201cincreased litigation risks which could, in turn, lead to further negative sentiment against us and our industry,\u201d Devon said in its 10-K.\n\nThe inclusion of the task force in a company\u2019s 10-K risk factors doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the SEC is probing its ESG disclosures, said Emily Strauss, a University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, associate professor, who studies securities litigation and enforcement. But companies like oil producers and Bitcoin miners face a higher risk of ESG-related enforcement due to the carbon-intensive nature of their businesses, she said.\n\n\u201cFirms are being more forthcoming and more conscious about some of the risks that they face and connections to misstatements about those issues,\u201d Strauss said.\n\nAnd if one company reports a new risk, its peers likely will take notice, Greer said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the last one to have incorporated that general risk disclosure,\u201d she said.\n\nRepresentatives of Ally, Pioneer, Devon and Core Scientific didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A Greenidge representative declined to comment.\n\nLull in Activity\n\nThe task force would enter new territory if it pursues a case against a Bitcoin miner or an oil company. The unit so far only has helped with enforcement actions concerning Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and iron ore miner Vale S.A. , in addition to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Benefytt Technologies Inc., according to SEC press releases.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon cases both centered on descriptions of the firms\u2019 ESG funds. BNY Mellon agreed to pay $1.5 million to resolve SEC claims the bank misled investors about its ESG fund labels, the agency announced in May 2022. Goldman Sachs reached a $4 million settlement with the SEC over allegations the firm didn\u2019t follow its policies and procedures for its ESG funds, the agency said in November.\n\nBenefytt and its former CEO, Gavin Southwell, agreed to pay more than $12 million to settle claims they hid tens of thousands of consumer complaints from investors when it was a public company known as Health Insurance Innovations Inc., the SEC announced in July 2022. Vale reached a $55.9 million deal with the SEC earlier this year to settle the agency\u2019s claims that the company misled investors about its dams\u2019 safety before a 2019 collapse killed 270 people after it helped bring the case in April 2022.\n\nSEC Enforcement Division Director Gurbir Grewal has said repeatedly that ESG cases are a priority. But an SEC press release hasn\u2019t mentioned any ESG-related enforcement work since the Vale settlement was announced in March.\n\nThe SEC may be trying to show its powers are inadequate to combat ESG wrongdoing and it needs regulations like its proposed climate disclosure rules in order for the task force to bring more cases, said Nicolas Morgan, a former agency lawyer and president of Investor Choice Advocates Network, a nonprofit law firm that fights what it considers to be government overreach.\n\nThe agency is looking to issue rules in October that would require companies to report on their greenhouse gas emissions and other risks they face from climate change. But the SEC has faced significant pushback and threats of a legal challenge from business interests and Republicans.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a distinct possibility that it is a strategic silence so that you\u2019re not feeding the critics of the proposed rule who say you already have the tools you need,\u201d said Morgan, who\u2019s also a partner at Paul Hastings LLP.\n\nAnother possibility: Some cases just take more time file, Strauss said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that an enforcement action hasn\u2019t appeared recently doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s not a lot of investigative activity going on,\u201d she said. \u201cThe SEC likes to bring enforcement actions that kind of give it the most signaling bang for its buck.\u201d"

        "content": "Standard Chartered has raised its bitcoin price predictions after seeing increased miner profitability.\n\nThe bank now projects the crypto asset to reach a price $50,000 by the end of 2023 \u2014 a 65% increase from current prices \u2014 and then hit $120,000 by the end of 2024, Bloomberg reported Monday (July 10).\n\nGeoff Kendrick, head of crypto research and EM FX West at Standard Chartered, said, per the report, that increased miner profitability will lead to reduced net bitcoin supply as miners can sell less while maintaining cash inflows.\n\n\u201cIncreased miner profitability per BTC mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,\u201d Kendrick said, according to the report.\n\nAlthough bitcoin hit all-time highs of nearly $69,000 in 2021, Standard Chartered sees more potential for growth, according to the report.\n\nThe bank has raised its forecast for bitcoin from its April expectation that prices would reach $100,000 by the end of next year, the report said.\n\nBecause bitcoin miners can cover their costs with the sale of fewer bitcoins when prices are high, they can hold on to more bitcoin in anticipation of selling them later at higher prices, reducing the availability.\n\nThis forecast comes at a turbulent time in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nOn June 5, it was reported that cryptocurrency prices fell after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed 13 charges against crypto exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao, alleging the exchange committed a variety of securities law violations.\n\nBitcoin was among those whose price fell at the time time, as it was trading at $25,628 on the afternoon of June 5 after having hit a high of $27,093 earlier that day.\n\nAbout a week earlier, on May 30, blockchain analytics provider Nansen became the latest company in the beleaguered crypto sector to cut jobs as it reduced its staff by 30%.\n\nThe company had been rapidly scaling its staff for years but, as Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik said at the time, the past year has been \u201cbrutal\u201d for the crypto sector."

        "content": "Bitcoin dipped in Monday morning trading in Asia but held above the US$30,000 support level. Ether edged lower along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, as anticipation of further interest rate hikes in the U.S. reduces appetite for risk across markets. Meanwhile, a JPMorgan report claims that the recent flurry of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the U.S. may not be the game changer that some expect. This is reducing some of the optimism surrounding ongoing Bitcoin ETF applications by major Wall Street names, including BlackRock.\n\nCryptos fall as ETF hype cools\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.32% over the last 24 hours to US$30,157 at 07:40 a.m. in Hong Kong to post a weekly loss of 1.33%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency traded in the lower US$30,000 range over the weekend.\n\nEther edged 0.09% lower to US$1,862 and lost 3.71% for the week.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also logged losses in the past 24 hours. The exception was Polygon\u2019s Matic token, which gained 1.15% to US$0.6876. It added 1.07% over the past seven days.\n\nWhile multiple Bitcoin ETF applications in the past month have stirred optimism in the crypto market, their approval may not prove as transformational as some Bitcoin advocates expect, claimed a JP Morgan report on Friday. Similar products have existed in Canada and Europe but received limited inflows, the report suggests.\n\nDespite this element of doubt creeping in, Bitcoin whales remain bullish on the token. Blockchain data tracker Santiment noted in a tweet on Sunday that addresses holding 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin had added a further 71,000 Bitcoin totalling approximately US$2.15 billion since July 17.\n\n\ud83e\udd88\ud83d\udc33 #Bitcoin's sharks and whales aren't showing any signs of slowing down, even with prices beginning to get \"boring\" in this $30k to $31k range. Since June 17th, 10 to 10k $BTC addresses have accumulated 71k more coins, equating to $2.15 billion. https://t.co/poBVnszbZY pic.twitter.com/XxYsHWCFRL \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 8, 2023\n\n\u201cInvestors sentiment seems to \u2014 still \u2014 be slightly bolstered by Blackrock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink\u2019s comment and the prospect that such an openness to the asset class increases the chances of a spot BTC ETF,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market-maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that while far off, the pile up of ETF applications hints at the fact that, eventually, we will see one and, once we do, other ETFs like an ETH-denominated one might see the light of day,\u201d d\u2019Anethan added.\n\nCrypto exchange BingX announced on Saturday it would support Polygon blockchain\u2019s Indore upgrade, which it said would improve the performance of the Polygon network. The move is likely to take effect from July 11.\n\nFounded in 2018 and headquartered in Singapore, BingX said it provides services in over 100 countries and regions, with over 5 million users, according to the press release.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap was unchanged in the past 24 hours at US$1.18 trillion, while crypto trading volume dipped 0.22% to US$19.74 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nDead cat bounce for NFT collections\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.73% in the 24 hours to 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,756.26, down 0.97% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Polygon and Cardano NFT market indices also logged drops, while Solana\u2019s index inched higher.\n\n\u201cOver the past few days the NFT market buyers and farmers have found some value in NFT collections that had hit all-time low floor prices,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nThe world\u2019s leading NFT marketplace Blur launched its version 2 trading platform last Thursday. This introduced a new \u201ctrait bidding\u201d feature that allows traders to bid on specific NFT traits rather than collections and receive Blur reward points.\n\n\u201cBlur\u2019s new trait offers are possibly taking pressure off of floor NFT farming,\u201d said Petscher. This could potentially lead to more price stability for Ethereum NFT projects, he added.\n\nThe floor prices of major Ethereum-based NFT collections Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Azuki and HV-MTL have all logged two-digit gains in the past seven days. However, all three are still down at least 25% for the month, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\n\u201cThe sentiment in the NFT community is that [a number of collections] likely won\u2019t recover and that this is a dead cat bounce. I expect prices to continue to bleed out until these collections find floors in the low few hundred dollar range,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 10.37% to US$26.49 million as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Cryptoslam data. The volume on the Ethereum blockchain edged up 1.39% to US$14.89 million, while Bitcoin volume jumped 87.65% to US$6.76 million.\n\nU.S. equities down amid rate hike concerns\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 11:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CNN. The three major U.S. indexes also closed lower on regular session trading Friday and logged losses for the week.\n\nMeanwhile, most main stock indexes across Asia are mixed on Monday, with China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng edging up. South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei posted losses.\n\nThe U.S. employment situation summary by the Labor Department on Friday showed the economy added 209,000 jobs in June. That is the smallest monthly increase in the past two and a half years and lower than Reuters\u2019 expectation of 225,000.\n\nHowever, wage increases and a drop in the unemployment rate indicate that the labor market is still tight. That may pave the way for further monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve within the year.\n\nThe U.S. interest rate currently sits between 5% and 5.25%. However, the CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 92.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase at the Fed\u2019s meeting on July 26. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is at just 7.6%.\n\nAnalysts also give a 35.2% chance that the Fed will raise the rate by another 25 basis points in November, up from 9.5% a month ago.\n\nAll eyes are now on the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) ahead of its release on Wednesday. The index will give investors more insight into U.S. inflation and the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\nAnalysts currently expect the annual inflation rate to drop to 3.1% in June, down from 4% in the previous month, as reported by Bloomberg on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the country\u2019s own CPI posted no annual increase in June. That is the weakest monthly showing since a drop in February 2021. The results point to a weakening recovery in the country\u2019s post-Covid economy. Further weakening may lead to calls for increased economic stimulus measures.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "Bitcoin Is Here to Stay, Tim Draper Says - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nLet's talk, first of all, about the reason that you've had to move your target on Bitcoin back, $250,000, you now say, by 2025. What has been holding Bitcoin back you think the most? I wasn't when I predicted it because I was at 4000. So it's gone to 30,000 in that time. And I wasn't really expecting the U.S. bureaucracy to be this aggressive. And I thought that maybe they would be recognizing that they've got to compete with the rest of the world. They've got to provide a platform from which entrepreneurs can can flourish. And by having this regulation, by enforcement that the SCC has been professing and driving, it's really driving all the great entrepreneurs out. And I think that that is that has hurt the Bitcoin price. But but Bitcoin is here to stay. It's a great it's a great system, it's a great currency, it's a great way to operate. I can't wait until I can raise a fund all in Bitcoin, invest it all on Bitcoin. And my my portfolio companies all pay their employees and suppliers all in Bitcoin and have taxes all paid in Bitcoin and have the waterfall all fall into people's bitcoin wallets because then there's no accounting, there's no auditing, there's no bookkeeping. It's all done on the blockchain and it's all honest and it's all straight. And I think that that is going to be that's going to bring society to an anthropological leap forward. It's going to be an amazing time and I can't wait for it. I guess I thought that it was going to happen a little sooner than it did. I also thought retailers would recognize that they can save 2% by accepting Bitcoin, and I thought they'd recognize that sooner. But that hasn't happened yet, and I think it's going to happen about the right time, about the same time as that happening. And maybe we'll get my price target then. Tim, a lot of you know, a lot of the OG Bitcoiners have sort of given up on the transactional piece of it on the currency side of it, looking at it more as a store of wealth like digital gold, why are you still pushing that that use case and how would it work? Would you use the Lightning Network or some other software patch to make it faster and more efficient? Yeah, I think when people talk about using Bitcoin as a store of value and that that being the only use, what they're missing is that the Lightning Network can operate on chain. So all these people who talk about Bitcoin using too much energy or it's too slow or whatever, they're missing that. When you move it off to the Lightning Network and maybe with open Node or whatever, it can do 5000 transactions a second and it doesn't require a lot of energy. And and I think that as the software starts being built for the smart contracts on Bitcoin, when ETFs are more targeted toward Bitcoin, they're calling for calling them ordinal, not ETFs, foreign entities. Yes, there were a lot of credibility and BlackRock guys are going to be doing it, but the nav ts, one CnF, ts or ordinal become a part of Bitcoin. And when when it does start focusing around Bitcoin, I think you're going to start seeing the real flourishing of Bitcoin. And and I think FDX sent us a very strong message that we don't want centralized currencies of any kind and we don't want I mean, we don't want a central bank, we don't want centralized currencies of any kind because they can be controlled by one person and that one person can take us off a cliff."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlackRock is trying to become the first asset manager to launch a fund tracking the price of bitcoin.\n\nLast month, the asset management giant filed an application to launch its exchange-traded fund, which many crypto execs believe could become the first spot bitcoin vehicle to be approved by the US markets watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nInstitutional investors aren't allowed to buy cryptocurrencies at the moment \u2013 but SEC approval of BlackRock's filing would change all that, offering Wall Street a cheap and regulated route into the token.\n\nCEO Larry Fink has backed up his firm's push for the spot ETF by repeating bitcoin bulls' usual talking points, saying last week that the token is akin to \"digitizing gold\" and could eventually \"revolutionize\" finance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the question Fink hasn't answered is: why now?\n\nIt might seem like an odd time for BlackRock to be pushing to launch its ETF, with the crypto industry still reeling from a brutal 2022 \u2013 when the price of key tokens cratered and high-profile firms, like Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX, collapsed.\n\nThe SEC has responded by launching an \"all-out assault\" on big-name exchanges like Binance and Coinbase in a bid to protect US-based investors, who saw massive amounts of money wiped out when Bankman-Fried's crypto empire failed in November.\n\nBut bitcoin has staged a mini-comeback in 2023 despite all that, with the token's price jumping more than 80% to over $30,000 as investors turn more optimistic on the economy and anticipate the end of the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the fact that BlackRock filed for its ETF off the back of that rally probably speaks to Wall Street's desire not to miss out on another potential bull run.\n\nAt the start of 2021, most top banks took a scathing stance on digital assets \u2013 and then missed out on a massive surge, fueled by low interest rates, that helped bitcoin's price to quadruple in the space of a year and turned crypto into a $2 trillion industry.\n\nBlackRock's spot ETF filing, and Fink's conversion from skeptic to potential savior, suggest that Wall Street is determined not to make the same mistake twice."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe cost of mining one Bitcoin will rise to $40,000 after the next halving\n\nMiners are becoming more sophisticated with their power costs and secure the pricing from their power providers in advance\n\nA large number of less productive miners will eventually be forced out of the market\n\nCrypto fans are hoping that a once-every-four-years event, in this case \u2013 Bitcoin halving, that modifies the fundamental code of the largest cryptocurrency in the world, will prolong the recent market upswing. But the achievement could also spell the end for some Bitcoin miners.\n\nHalving Typically Followed by BTC Price Increase\n\nThe quadrennial occurrence, rather menacingly known as \u201cthe Halving\u201d or \u201cHalvening,\u201d is typically followed by exponential increases in the price of Bitcoin. According to reports , the token increased by roughly 8,450%, 290%, and 560% each of the previous three manifestations in 2012, 2016, and 2020.\n\nUnder the alias Satoshi Nakamoto, a computer programmer or group of programmers created Bitcoin in 2009. As the name implies, halvings reduce by half the amount of Bitcoin that each miner can receive for utilizing specialized, high-power-exploiting computers to verify transactions on the blockchain of the digital asset. The next halving, scheduled for April 2024, will reduce miners\u2019 incentives from the current 6.25 Bitcoin per block, or $188,876, to 3.125 Bitcoin per block, or $94,438.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts believe that the limited supply will assist in keeping Bitcoin\u2019s price stable over time, or at least until 21 million tokens, the maximum amount that can ever be mined, are produced in the year 2140.\n\nDue to price spikes following each reward halving and improvements in mining rig efficiency brought about by technological developments, miners have so far been able to make up for the cash lost when payouts are reduced.\n\nHowever, the mining economy seems worse than before the next halving.\n\nAs a result of their less effective mining operations and higher expenditures, Jaran Mellerud, a crypto-mining expert at Hashrate Index, forecasted that \u201cnearly half of the miners will suffer.\u201d\n\nHe made reference to the break-even electricity price for the most popular mining machine, which is predicted to go from 12 cents/kWh to six cents/kWh following a halving. According to Mellerud, about 40% of miners still have higher operational expenses per kWh. He stated that smaller miners and those that outsource the operation of their mining rigs will find it difficult to survive, as will those whose running costs are higher than 8 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n\nLess Productive Miners Will See Net Income Going South\n\nWolfie Zhao, head of research at TheMinerMag, a research division of mining consultancy BlocksBridge, continued, \u201cIf you factor in everything, the total cost for some miners is well above Bitcoin\u2019s current price.\u201d Many miners with less productive operations will see a decline in net income.\n\nAlthough the price of Bitcoin has increased by more than 80% this year to over $30,000, it is still less than half of the record high of almost $69,000 set in late 2021. The cost of production for miners has increased along with the cost of electricity, and for many of them, their debt loads are now unmanageable.\n\nAccording to Ethan Vera, chief operations officer at cryptocurrency mining services provider Luxor Technologies, the worldwide mining sector has a debt of $4.5 billion to $6 billion, down from $8 billion in 2022.\n\nThis debt consists of senior debt, loans secured by mining equipment, and loans backed by Bitcoin. At the end of the first quarter, outstanding debts for 12 large publicly traded mining businesses, including Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Platforms, were roughly $2 billion, down from $2.3 billion the previous quarter, according to statistics provided by Hashrate Index.\n\nAfter China\u2019s communist government banned domestic mining in the latter half of 2021, miners from that country moved to North America, contributing to the borrowing boom.\n\nThe financial market was one item the miners lacked, according to Zhao. \u201cDebt financing is much more readily available in the US.\u201d\n\nProfit margins have also shrunk as a result of increased competition among Bitcoin miners. According to data from btc.com , mining difficulty, a measure of the computational power required to generate Bitcoin, reached a record high in June.\n\nPower Costs In the Rise\n\nBitcoin will need to increase to $50,000\u2013$60,000 next year, according to Kevin Zhang, senior vice president of mining strategy at cryptocurrency mining company Foundry, which industry giant Digital Currency Group owns, for miners to maintain the same profit margins after the halving.\n\nAnd while miners had a little break early this year when electricity prices dropped and Bitcoin\u2019s price recovered following a protracted crypto winter, power costs are now rising once more. Texas, a significant crypto hub, is currently going through an early heat wave.\n\nBefore the halving, Bitcoin miners are taking a number of precautions to safeguard themselves, including locking in power pricing, increasing war chests, and reducing investment.\n\nWhen it comes to the actual halving, Zhang explained that miners are getting ready by attempting to be more intelligent with their power bills and securing the pricing from their power providers in advance.\n\nIn order to protect its Bitcoin treasury before the halving, Hut 8 Mining Corp. signed into a $50 million credit facility last month with a division of Coinbase Global Inc. Additionally, Texas-based Bitcoin miner Lotta Yotta is shoring up six months\u2019 worth of cash flow while reducing investments in order to get ready for the occasion, according to Tiffany Wang, the company\u2019s CEO.\n\nRegarding new investment in Bitcoin mining facilities, Wang texted, \u201cDuring halving year, it is high risk.\u201d \u201cTo keep the business running, it is preferable to save some money in the account.\u201d\n\nAccording to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the halving is anticipated to ultimately double Bitcoin\u2019s production cost to around $40,000 in a June 1 note. According to data gathered by TheMinerMag, the cost of mining one Bitcoin in the first quarter varied between around $7,200 and $18,900 among a cohort of 14 publicly-traded miners.\n\nAccording to Zhao, the expenditures determined do not take into account other significant costs such debt interest payments, managerial salary, or marketing.\n\nEveryone needs to be ready, Wang emphasized. Sadly, a large number of miners will eventually be forced out of the market."

        "content": "Standard Chartered expects the profitability of bitcoin miners will play a crucial role in driving the price of bitcoin (BTC) to $50,000 by the end of this year, and to $100,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nIn a Monday note, Geoffrey Kendrick, StanChart\u2019s head of FX and digital assets research, highlighted the role played by miners in determining the overall supply of newly mined bitcoin.\n\nThis reduction in selling leads to a decrease in the overall supply of bitcoin, which ultimately drives up the price.\n\nStanChart\u2019s prediction aligns with an earlier forecast in April, when Kendrick said several factors would propel bitcoin toward $100,000 by the end of next year.\n\nHowever, this time he emphasized the significance of miner profitability as the key contributing factor, considering it to be more impactful than earlier believed.\n\nQ2 showed drop in miner sales, boosting prices\n\nStanChart noted that during the first quarter of 2023, the 12 largest listed miners, representing 20% of global bitcoin mining, sold 106% of the bitcoin they mined.\n\nThis selling percentage appears to have slightly decreased to below 100% in the second quarter, reducing the supply and contributing to higher prices.\n\nBy adjusting their selling strategy, miners have the potential to benefit from the anticipated price increase in bitcoin.\n\nStanChart expects bitcoin to rise to about $50,000 by the end of 2023 as the share of newly mined bitcoin sold is projected to decrease to around 20% to 30%.\n\nThis adjustment translates to miners reducing the number of bitcoin they sell per day from the current 900 to between 180 and 270.\n\nIncreased cash profits set to drive decreased selling\n\nThe bank highlighted that after speaking with bitcoin miners directly, it became evident that miners have three sources of cash: selling bitcoin, selling equity or borrowing.\n\nMiners indicated that selling equity was unlikely due to low equity prices, and borrowing money was unfavorable due to high interest rates.\n\nConsequently, selling bitcoin remains the most feasible option for miners to raise cash in the current cycle.\n\nHowever, with higher bitcoin prices and increased cash profits, selling is expected to decrease significantly over time, supporting further price increases.\n\n\u201cWe reiterate our end-2024 BTC price target of around USD 100,000, with potential upside from reduced miner selling,\u201d Kendrick said.\n\nNewcomers shine in cost efficiency\n\nThe bank evaluated miner profitability based on three factors: the direct cash cost of mining one Bitcoin (mostly electricity costs), the total cash costs per Bitcoin mined and whether mined bitcoins are sold or held.\n\nThey found that cash costs varied among companies, with Cipher Mining and TeraWulf as relative newcomers having the lowest costs.\n\nOn the measure of all-cash costs, Cipher Mining performed well, while larger-scale operations like Riot and Core Scientific also demonstrated favorable results.\n\nGoldman Sachs earlier predicted a $100,000 target for bitcoin\n\nVarious analysts have weighed in on bitcoin\u2019s potential trajectory. At the start of last year, Goldman Sachs said bitcoin could hit $100,000 in the next five years if investors treat it like gold.\n\nMore recently, Matrixport\u2019s head of research predicted the cryptoasset would hit $125,000 by the end of next year.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "At anniversary of 2016 BTC halving, a look to the next one - Blockworks",
        "content": "Seven years ago, Monday, bitcoin mining rewards were cut from 25 bitcoins to 12.5 BTC \u2014 a phenomenon that spurred a price rally industry watchers expect to repeat when the next Bitcoin halving hits in 2024.\n\nThe implications of the history of halvings repeating in bullish price terms would spill over to bitcoin traders and holders, as well as miners and other network participants. It\u2019s a pattern that has held true across a number of halvings: The 2016 halving was Bitcoin\u2019s second, taking place nearly four years after the first in 2012 and four years before the third in 2020.\n\nA fourth bitcoin halving is slated for April 2024, at which point mining rewards will fall to 3.125 BTC per block.\n\nBitcoin traded around $650 on July 9, 2016, Berenberg Capital Markets analysts noted in a recent report. And 524 days later, it hit a then-record of $19,712.\n\nSimilar rallies occurred after the first and third bitcoin halvings, Berenberg analysts \u2014 Mark Palmer, Matthew LaFlash and Hassan Saleem \u2014 found.\n\nBitcoin jumped from $12 on Nov. 28, 2012 to $1,164 just 367 days later.\n\nAfter mining rewards were slashed from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC on May 11, 2020 \u2014 when one bitcoin cost $8,821 \u2014 it reached its all-time high 549 days later at $69,036.\n\n\u201cIf a rally were to occur after the fourth halving, and if it were as long-lived as the rallies that occurred after the past couple of halvings, then it would continue until around October 2025,\u201d the Berenberg analysts wrote.\n\nBut the adoption level of bitcoin now from seven years ago is distinctly different, industry participants said.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hash rate sits at roughly 425 million terahash/second (TH/s), according to data compiled by YCharts.com. That figure was closer to 1.5 million terahash/second (TH/s) in July 2016.\n\n\u201cBack in 2016 you could solo mine with just your laptop, whereas now you need high-end, mining-specific machines and join large mining pools to compete,\u201d said Matt Lason, chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund Globe 3 Capital.\n\nRead more: Which bitcoin miners are growing the fastest in 2023?\n\nLason added he expects bitcoin\u2019s price to follow previous trends by spiking in the upcoming halving\u2019s aftermath, noting that the bitcoin halving cycle is set to correspond with a crypto and equity bull market.\n\n\u201cWhile past price increases don\u2019t guarantee a future increase, the bitcoin halvings serve as a great reminder for everyone of the power of bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy and the true value of scarcity in an inflationary world,\u201d Lason told Blockworks.\n\nBitcoin up 82% in 2023\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price fell below $17,000 after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. But it stood at about $30,300 Monday afternoon \u2014 up roughly 82% so far in 2023.\n\nThe Berenberg Capital Markets analysts pointed out, too, bitcoin\u2019s positive price action after BlackRock \u2014 a TradFi giant with $9 trillion assets under management \u2014 filed an application with the SEC to launch a spot bitcoin ETF last month.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink said last week during a Fox Business interview he believes the role of crypto is \u201cdigitizing gold in many ways.\u201d He also referred to bitcoin as an \u201cinternational asset.\u201d\n\nDespite an expected rise in bitcoin price, the 2024 halving presents a unique challenge for miners, Lason said. As the rewards of those companies are set to drop, their hardware and electricity costs have \u201cexploded,\u201d he added.\n\nMore miners have opted to sell at least a portion of the bitcoin they mine in recent months to cover various operating costs.\n\nGeoffrey Kendrick, head of Standard Chartered\u2019s foreign exchange and digital assets research, said in a research note Monday that he expects miner selling to decrease amid higher bitcoin prices and increased cash profits.\n\nThis could push bitcoin\u2019s price to $50,000 by the end of the year and to $100,000 by the end of 2024, he added.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "While the cryptocurrency community is actively discussing the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024, another potentially big market event is happening this year.\n\nThe trustee of the hacked Bitcoin (BTC) exchange, Mt. Gox, is set to finally repay the exchange\u2019s creditors by the end of October 2023. If that happens, the cryptocurrency market could be significantly affected in several ways, some industry observers agree.\n\nFounded in 2010, Mt. Gox was once the biggest Bitcoin exchange in the world, estimated to facilitate around 70% of all BTC transactions before its implosion.\n\nThe now-defunct exchange lost 850,000 BTC \u2014 4% of all Bitcoin to be issued \u2014 in a security breach in 2014. The event made Mt. Gox one of the biggest cryptocurrency bankruptcies of all time, with creditors yet to be repaid nine years later.\n\nAs the current Mt. Gox repayment deadline is scheduled to occur in roughly three months, Cointelegraph has reached out to some crypto executives to find out what to expect from the anticipated Mt. Gox repayment.\n\nWhat will the investors do once they get their Bitcoin back?\n\nThe repayment of Mt. Gox will be a unique event, which is certain to have a significant impact on the market, WhaleWire founder and CEO Jacob King believes.\n\nAfter losing all their Bitcoin almost 10 years ago, most creditors are likely to sell at least part of their BTC once they finally get it back, King told Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cThis influx of sell orders could create a downward pressure on prices and potentially lead to a market downturn,\u201d he said. King also mentioned multiple prolonged delays in the Mt. Gox repayment process, which has already caused a sense of \u201cdisillusionment among investors, eroding their confidence in the market.\u201d\n\nThe WhaleWire CEO continued:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple question of, what will the investors do? Over the last year, we\u2019ve seen more sells than buys, and many of those who lost on Mt. Gox have moved on past crypto. The chances they hold for more years, after everything that happened, is highly unlikely.\u201d\n\nSome of the Mt. Gox creditors themselves admit that the Bitcoin market may face some selling pressure once the repayment is done. However, many claimants are likely to continue to hodl, as one trader who described himself as a Mt. Gox creditor told Cointelegraph. He stated:\n\n\u201cWhen we get our coins, I think we\u2019re all going to hold. But when the news hits the world that these coins are going to be released, people who have coins but who are not the claimants are going to sell for fear of the price going down.\u201d\n\nHow much will be repaid?\n\nMt. Gox expects to repay a total of more than 10,000 crypto creditors from all over the world by the end of October. Despite the exchange losing 850,000 BTC, Mt. Gox will only repay part of the total losses from the hack because the firm could only recover some of the funds.\n\nAccording to online reports, Mt. Gox will reimburse its creditors 142,000 BTC ($4.3 billion) and 143,000 in forked cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), worth roughly $40 million. The bankrupt exchange will also reportedly pay out 69 billion Japanese yen ($510 million). Payments will be made using a combination of fiat currency and cryptocurrencies, with each payout coordinated individually with each investor.\n\nThe repayment of Mt. Gox funds will be a massive event, Whale Alert co-founder Frank Weert agrees. But the way it influences the market will depend much on how the funds are released and how the media report it, the exec told Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cWe are sure some will be glad to be able to finally cash out, but we doubt it will cause a massive sell-off,\u201d he stated. When asked whether the crypto industry has ever seen a similar event, Weert said that there hasn\u2019t ever been an event on such a scale so far.\n\nSome major creditors, including Bitcoinica and MtGox Investment Funds, reportedly chose to have their bankruptcy recovery funds paid out in Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to data from the Mt.

Gox Bitcoin repayment amount is close to Michael Saylor\u2019s BTC holdings\n\nWhile many crypto enthusiasts believe that Mt. Gox repayment will be a massive event, some skeptics are confident that any potential effects will likely subside quickly.\n\nThe amount of Bitcoin that is to be handed back to Mt.

I would assume there may be some sell pressure due to the speculation around this event. Many people don\u2019t know basic math.\u201d\n\nGreenspan also stressed that Mt.

        "content": "Switzerland has long been a haven for the wealthy due to its well-established banking secrecy laws, but its citizens have warmed quickly to the self-sovereign ideals behind Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nSpeaking with Cointelegraph journalist Joe Hall at the Plan \u20bf Bitcoin Summer School in Lugano, Switzerland, Giw Zanganeh, head of Lugano\u2019s Plan \u20bf initiative, highlighted the growing use of Bitcoin for everyday payments in the Swiss city.\n\nZanganeh chats with Cointelegraph\u2019s Joe Hall at the Plan B Summer School in Lugano.\n\nLugano has emerged as an adoption hub for Bitcoin, Tether (USDT) and its self-styled LVGA stablecoin, which can be used to pay for a variety of utility bills, goods and services across the city.\n\nZanganeh believes that Switzerland has shown remarkable adoption of cryptocurrencies despite its renowned traditional financial and banking infrastructure:\n\n\u201cWhat I see is a society, which makes me very bullish; a lot of people are interested in Bitcoin from a philosophical perspective as well. It aligns very well with Swiss values.\u201d\n\nZanganeh added that the Swiss are typically \u201cstrong on individual sovereignty and financial privacy\u201d, which creates overlaps between the values of Swiss culture and those of the Bitcoin movement:\n\n\u201cConsidering the amount of Bitcoin-only companies in Switzerland, it probably has one of the highest density per capita of Bitcoin-only companies around the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Zanganeh, more politicians, diplomats and members of parliament and Switzerland\u2019s financial commission are becoming Bitcoiners, reaffirming a bullish outlook for BTC adoption in the country.\n\nRelated: McDonald\u2019s, pizza and coffee paid in Bitcoin: The Plan B for crypto payments\n\nA significant contributor to increased Bitcoin usage is the effort to inform and educate the Swiss populace about the merits of BTC:\n\n\u201cWe have regular articles in newspapers where we touch on different aspects of Bitcoin and financial liberty. We try to reach people interested in financial freedom and freedom of speech. Maybe they don\u2019t know how Bitcoin plays a role there.\u201d\n\nWhile the uptake of Plan \u20bf\u2019s Bitcoin adoption is a \u201cgradual process,\u201d Zanganeh said that onboarding merchants across Lugano has been crucial in opening up a new payments paradigm in the region.\n\nLikening the process of Bitcoin adoption to the initial proliferation of bank cards some 50 years ago, Zanganeh said that practical experience with novel transactional methods would continue to onboard more users to the Bitcoin ecosystem:\n\n\u201cIf you look at merchants over time, if more and more people go and pay with Bitcoin, you're going to learn.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, Bitcoin Suisse CEO Dirk Klee highlighted the country\u2019s potential as a center point for institutional cryptocurrency adoption.\n\nThe Canton of Zug is another region of Switzerland that continues to attract cryptocurrency and blockchain firms due to its progressive, government-backed, crypto-friendly initiatives.\n\nThe interview is part of an upcoming Cointelegraph documentary about what it\u2019s like to attend a Bitcoin School.

        "title": "Bitcoin has entered a civil war \u2014 Over 'art' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In an email dated Jan. 17, 1993, Hal Finney \u2014 a developer and early contributor to Bitcoin \u2014 shared the concept of \u201cencrypted digital cards,\u201d which are now known as nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\n\u201cGiving a little more thought to the idea of buying and selling digital cash, I thought of a way to present it,\u201d Finney wrote at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re buying and selling \u2018cryptographic trading cards.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe most fascinating detail of his email lies in the fact that, by sharing this idea, Finney intended to facilitate the understanding of the concept of digital money. His vision foreshadowed what we saw in 2021 with the NFT boom. Overnight, the crypto space shifted from being solely about financial decentralization to also encompassing the decentralization of art, gaming, entertainment and more.\n\nHal Finney's email about \"encrypted digital cards.\"\n\nThe narrative that was once theoretical and pushed forcefully became practical and part of the daily culture of millions of people who had never considered buying cryptocurrencies before. And with the introduction of the Ordinals protocol in early 2023, we are witnessing the emergence of such cases.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin fragments could become more valuable than full Bitcoins\n\nHowever, this movement is not being well-received by some \u201cred-eyed guardians.\u201d\n\nThe Wizard JPEG that sparked a civil war in Bitcoin\n\nIn February 2023, the Taproot Wizards achieved a notable feat using the Ordinals protocol. They generated the largest block ever recorded in Bitcoin\u2019s history at that time, reaching nearly 4 megabytes in size.\n\nEric Wall tweet about the largest block in Bitcoin's history. Source: Twitter\n\nTheir goal was clear: to challenge the existing norms and cultivate an experimental and rebellious mindset within the Bitcoin ecosystem. More than 14 million inscriptions have occurred since the \u201cWizard Block,\u201d generating something magnificent: a circular digital economy where assets are priced, bought and sold via Bitcoin (BTC). (Inscriptions inscribe sats with content, creating NFTs.)\n\nLibert\u00e9, rare sats and Fraternit\u00e9\n\nTo illustrate the rapid pace of experiments within this ecosystem, in February, traders were buying and selling Ordinal NFTs using Google Sheets since there were no available marketplaces.\n\n\u201cWe are experimenters in an experimental protocol. And my goal is clear: to onboard, educate, entertain and experiment on the Bitcoin blockchain,\u201d a figure in the Ordinal ecosystem who goes by \u201cBitGod\u201d told me in an interview.\n\nYet, in a matter of mere months, notable corporations and projects entered the scene, providing some framework for this market. As a result, the market has witnessed over 140,000 distinct users and a trading volume surpassing $220 billion.\n\nAnd among the experiments sparking this interest, one narrative has captured the attention of the general public: rare sats.\n\nMany projects are using this narrative to tokenize their artworks. CTRL, for example, was the first project to inscribe on a \u201cRare\u201d satoshi.\n\nCTRL's tweet about inscribing the first \"Rare\" Satoshi. Source: Twitter\n\n\u201cI think the image symbolizes the CTRL movement and its inflection point at the time of discovering the Rare sat,\u201d Jameson Mah told me. \u201cThe movement is diverse, humble, cypherpunk, fresh blood and energy. CTRL is quite literally replacing the vintage $2 bill that represents the old archaic systems, and the hash of the Rare sat inscription peeking out the back. Then Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s genesis block message that started it all is illuminated by the light of the power of the Rare sat in the center. It\u2019s non-violent, but it\u2019s also clearly rebellious.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: Even worse for crypto than central exchanges\n\nCurrently, only eight Rare sats similar to the one used by CTRL in their artwork have been found. And one of them has a bid of $600,000 in an auction. The other one is Gansy, the founder of the Rare Satoshi Society. He disclosed that RSS has already generated over $2.5 million by providing satoshis with specific attributes for more than 100 Ordinals projects. With the objective of preserving their status as the leading supplier of rare sats in the market, his team has already transacted over $3 billion in BTC, searching for the gems that constitute their current portfolio.\n\nThere are several other experiments bringing fresh blood to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Prominent Ordinals use cases that deserve exploration include BRC-20, bitmap and recursive inscriptions.\n\nWhat to expect from Bitcoin season 2?\n\nRecognizing Ordinals as a highly complementary movement to the success of Bitcoin is crucial. The ecosystem\u2019s triumph does not hinge on a single solution, but rather a combination of various factors that contribute to its prosperity.\n\nIn certain instances, such as in Argentina, the adoption of Bitcoin will be driven by necessity. For others, it will stem from their fascination with the underlying principles of Bitcoin. Institutional adoption through ETFs will contribute a significant portion to the adoption curve. Additionally, the emergence of Ordinals applications will bring a dual benefit to the network, fostering both adoption and the evolution of the ecosystem\u2019s infrastructure.\n\n\u201cMy first expectation is that many projects will experiment on Bitcoin,\u201d Mah said, adding, \u201cNext, with this renewed interest, the network will become a lot more expensive to use. Therefore, some of this activity logically should move to layer 2s. Many builders are already experimenting with rollup architecture on top of Bitcoin, for example.\u201d\n\nTo conclude, Mah said, \u201cIt\u2019s important among the hype to always look for true innovation, substance and creativity \u2014 and importantly, Bitcoin-native thinking.\u201d\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nLugui Tillier is the chief commercial officer of Lumx Studios, a Web3 studio that counts BTG Pactual Bank, the largest investment bank in Latin America, among its investors.

Gox creditors are set to receive payouts in October 2023.\n\n142,000 BTC, currently worth $4.3 billion, are set to return to general circulation.\n\nAnalysts believe it could influence the market price of Bitcoin.\n\nIn just three months\u2019 time, $4.3 billion worth of Bitcoin is set to be paid out to creditors of the defunct, infamous Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nThe trustee in charge of recouping funds from the exchange closed final creditor registration in preparation for the reimbursement of user BTC holdings in April 2023. A statement from attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi tipped October 31 for the processing of some payments to creditors.\n\nSome 20,000 creditors are looking to receive funds that were lost in the collapse of Mt. Gox, which became the most infamous cryptocurrency exchange failure between 2010 and 2020 before the likes of FTX imploded.\n\nTotal current balance on all known addresses* of the MtGox Trustee: 135890.98002134 BTC. -0.00043187 BTC have been moved away from these addresses since 2018/05/10. $BTC #bitcoin #mtgox mt.gox mt gox 2023-07-11T09:19:03.239Z UTC \u2014 MtGoxBalanceBot (@MtGoxBalanceBot) July 11, 2023\n\nWhile an official number is yet to be confirmed by Mt. Gox , an estimated 142,000 BTC are held by the trust, valued at around $4.3 billion as of July 2023. Twitter bot MtGoxBalanceBot tips the known addresses of the Mt. Gox trustee to hold 135,890 BTC.\n\nGiven the substantial amount of Bitcoin set to be repaid to creditors, as well as the significant appreciation in the value of the holdings of Mt. Gox users since the exchange went defunct, a potential offloading of recouped BTC onto various exchanges is touted to influence the price of Bitcoin later this year.\n\nTotal Repayment Less Than BTC\u2019s Daily Trading Volume\n\nThe biggest talking point ahead of the looming Mt. Gox creditor payout is the potential price impact the event will have on Bitcoin across the world. As initially reported by Cointelegraph, some analysts believe that the repayment program might not be as influential as it is being made out to be.\n\nQuantum Economics founder and seasoned cryptocurrency market analyst Mati Greenspan said that the amount of BTC that is set to be returned simply pales in comparison to present-day trading activity.\n\n\u201cSome will HODL. Some will sell. Ultimately, it doesn\u2019t really matter since the total Mt. Gox repayment is marginally less than BTC\u2019s daily trading volume,\u201d Greenspan wrote on Twitter.\n\nSome will HODL. Some will sell. Ultimately, it doesn't really matter since the total Mt. Gox repayment is marginally less than BTC's daily trading volume.

Gox repayment date, the potential for a sizable portion of BTC being sold off on markets might have a compounding negative effect on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nEXPECT A 30% Bitcoin & 50% Altcoin DUMP IF THIS PLAYS OUT! https://t.co/R0UPOqNsaw \u2014 Crypto Banter (@crypto_banter) July 10, 2023\n\n22,500 Creditors Recognized, Claims Amount to $18.6 billion BTC\n\nA report published by Blockchain Research Lab (BRL) in August 2022 highlights that a total of 22,560 individual creditors were recognized by the Mt. Gox trustee.\n\n20,658 of the creditors have made claims in BTC while 11,868 made fiat currency claims. The report tipped the claims to be valued at $18.6 billion in BTC and Bitcoin Cash as well as $48 million in US dollars.\n\nInterestingly, Mt. Gox founder Mark Karpeles indicated that the exchange had 1.1 million active accounts in 2013, meaning that only 2.1% of all active accounts filed and received claims.\n\nBRL suggests that many accounts might not have had substantial holdings at the time of Mt. Gox\u2019s bankruptcy filing as a possible reason for this low percentage.\n\nThe report also noted that the average claim for Mt. Gox Bitcoin creditors is ~39 BTC, which is valued at $1.1 million as of July 2023. Creditors can expect to receive double that amount, given that they\u2019ll receive an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) tokens following the hard fork of the latter blockchain from the Bitcoin core network."

The SEC sued Coinbase a month ago, alleging it was operating as an unregistered broker, clearinghouse and exchange, having listed at least 13 different cryptocurrencies that are unregistered securities.

The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recently fluctuated around the US$30,000 line but prices turned softer late last week on mixed signals about the likelihood of approval for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds. The token is still sitting on a weekly loss of 2.35%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nHowever, some optimism returned to Bitcoin\u2019s pricing outlook after Standard Chartered bank predicted in a Monday report the token would reach US$50,000 by the end of 2023 and US$120,000 at the end of the following year, according to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event to take place next April, scarcer Bitcoin supply could drive up prices and in turn prompt miners to hoard the token, the Standard Chartered report said. \u201cIncreased miner profitability per BTC (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,\u201d according to the report.\n\nAnother plus for prices: cryptocurrency-linked investment products saw net inflows of US$136 million in the week ending July 7, marking the third consecutive week of inflows and fully correcting the prior nine weeks of outflows, according to European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares on Monday.\n\n\u201cBitcoin remains the focus amongst investors, with inflows totalling US$133m last week, while short-bitcoin saw outflows of US$1.8m, its 11th consecutive week, further demonstrating investors favour the asset over altcoins at present,\u201d wrote CoinShares in the report.\n\nEther rose 1.00% to US$1,880, but like Bitcoin it\u2019s coming off softer prices and is still down 3.80% for the week.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged gains in the past 24 hours with the exception of Dogecoin and Solana\u2019s SOL, which both dipped but the declines were within 0.5%.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic led the winners, jumping 6.97% to US$0.7356 and adding 3.33% for the week. \u201cSome positive on-chain signs for the 12th ranked market cap asset include rebounding network growth, decreasing supply on exchanges, and low profit taking,\u201d said crypto data tracker Santiment in a tweet on early Tuesday, adding the token is on a \u201cmini-run.\u201d\n\nMatic\u2019s recent run up comes as Polygon Labs unveiled its Polygon 2.0 roadmap on June 30, vowing to become the \u201cValue Layer of the Internet\u201d and on Friday appointed the firm\u2019s former chief legal officer Marc Boiron as its new Chief Executive Officer.\n\nHowever, the token has had a rough ride in 2023, down about 2%, and has plenty of ground to make up on peers such as Solana, which has jumped 115% so far this year. Polkadot has gained 18% in the same period\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization moved up 0.81% in the past 24 hours to US$1.18 trillion, while trading volume surged 70.03% to US$33.54 billion.\n\nNFT volumes skid amid low floor prices\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.20% in the 24 hours to 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,745.16. Forkast\u2019s Solana, Polygon and Cardano NFT market indices also fell, while Ethereum\u2019s index rose.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume fell 9.41% to US$25.36 million, according to Cryptoslam data. The volume on the Ethereum blockchain dropped 2.39% to US$15.67 million, while Bitcoin volume fell 39.97% to US$4.22 million.\n\n\u201cPrimarily a red or even day across collections in regards to floor prices,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cTraders seem to be out of liquidity and most are accepting the idea that the NFT market will continue to decline.\u201d\n\nBy collection, trading volume in Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection topped the list, edging up 2.96% to US$2.16 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. The Bitcoin-based $FRAM BRC-20 NFTs and uncategorized Ordinals inscriptions ranked the second and the third.\n\nThe floor prices of BAYC and Mutant Ape Yacht Club edged higher in the past 24 hours, while Azuki and the Captainz moved around 1% lower. All four NFT collections have seen their floor prices slide 20% to 60% in the past month, according to data from NFT analytics platform WGMI.io.\n\nBlur Blend, the NFT lending platform of NFT marketplace Blur.io, started to support Azuki Elementals and Elemental Beans on Tuesday. The two NFT collections are spin-offs of Chiru Labs\u2019 Azuki, which have been criticized by some holders for being too similar to the original Azuki collection.\n\n\u201cAzuki Elementals and Elemental Beanz were both added to Blur\u2019s Blend lending protocol, and both saw their prices decrease as traders sold possibly to exit farmed collections,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cPerhaps they sense fear of further floor price decreases with gamified trading.\u201d\n\nAn end to rate hikes?\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 12:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, following on from gains in all three major U.S. indexes in regular Monday trading.\n\nU.S. equities received a boost from comments by several Federal Reserve officials on Monday, indicating that while more interest rate hikes are needed to curb inflation, the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening cycle is drawing to an end, Reuters reported on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMy view is that the funds rate will need to move up somewhat further from its current level and then hold there for a while as we accumulate more information on how the economy is evolving,\u201d said Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta J. Mester on Monday. The Fed was \u201ccloser to the end of our tightening phase than the beginning,\u201d she added.\n\nMost main stock indexes across Asia benefited from the optimism on Wall Street, with China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all moving higher on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Citigroup downgraded the outlook for U.S. stocks to neutral on Monday on expectations for a retreat in growth stocks and a recession in the fourth quarter of the year, according to Reuters on Monday.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for June comes out Wednesday, offering the latest insight into the pace of U.S. inflation. Financial giants including BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are also set to report their second-quarter earnings this week.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on July 26 to make its next move on interest rates, which now sit between 5% and 5.25%, The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 92.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase this month, and a 7.6% chance for the Fed to leave the rate unchanged.\n\nIn China, the People\u2019s Bank of China and National Financial Regulatory Administration said in a joint statement on Monday they would take measures to stabilize the country\u2019s property industry, which include encouraging financial institutions to extend property firms\u2019 outstanding loans through negotiations. The signal was welcomed by investors and drove up shares of property developers, according to Bloomberg on Tuesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "The weighted average cost of purchased Bitcoin recently reached a level signifying that all investors who have consistently dollar-cost averaged into the leading cryptocurrency are now in the black, regardless of how long they have been holding.\n\nJust a reminder that every single pleb who has been dollar cost averaging #bitcoin is now in profit no matter when they first started DCA'ing. Every single one of them! pic.twitter.com/pnuIqdQznM \u2014 Wicked (@w_s_bitcoin) July 3, 2023\n\nThis news comes despite the price of Bitcoin, as measured in U.S. dollars, still being down by over 50% from its all-time high of around $69,000.\n\nDollar-cost-averaging (DCA for short) is a strategy that consists of making regular purchases of an asset for a fixed dollar amount. The idea is that by spreading buy orders out over time, volatility can be mitigated. Some buys will execute at lower prices while others will be executed at higher prices. This method can be particularly appealing for an asset like Bitcoin, which has been known for its legendary volatility.\n\nAnd yet, many financial pundits in the space still cling to the notion of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) entire existence and market cap of nearly $600 billion being based on a Ponzi scheme of some sort. Others continue to deny that saving in the hardest form of money ever known has, so far, been an excellent investment thesis \u2014 one that has outperformed all others.\n\nYes, there may be risks. And yes, volatility definitely comes with the territory. But looking at such factors in a vacuum does not make for adequate analysis of any investment. The alternative strategies available must be taken into consideration, along with other variables such as:\n\nWhat is the current macro environment, and how might it change going forward? What impact might this have on different asset classes and their performance?\n\nWhat risk/reward ratio does one strategy offer in comparison to others?\n\nCan diversification lead to an optimized risk/return profile, or does YOLO\u2019ing all-in provide better returns?\n\nThese are just a few potential questions that could be worth investigating when it comes to arguments against dollar-cost averaging (DCAing) into BTC for the long term.\n\nBitcoin outperforms traditional investments\n\nSome investors, like those at Adamant Research, have been pointing out the reality of Bitcoin\u2019s most favorable risk/reward ratio for many years:\n\n\u201cWe assert that the long term risk reward ratio for Bitcoin is currently the most favorable of any liquid investment in the world. We expect for it to trade in a range of $3,000 to $6,500 after which we foresee the emergence of a new bull market.\u201d\n\nThe group made similar statements during the bear markets of 2015 and 2011 as well.\n\nMany traditional investments, like gold, real estate, or a portfolio consisting of 60% equities and 40% bonds, have significantly underperformed compared to DCA'ing into Bitcoin.\n\nThe following chart illustrates the relative performance of several currencies and asset classes against BTC quite well:\n\nNeedless to say, when it comes to comparing the performance of a DCA strategy in Bitcoin versus literally any other asset, there is little comparison to be made.\n\nTo diversify or not?\n\nTraditional asset managers tend to abide by certain rules, one of them being the idea of rebalancing. When a particular asset outperforms, profits should be taken and distributed elsewhere, according to this line of thinking.\n\nIt can be considered a form of diversification \u201con the go,\u201d so to speak. But whether discussing diversifying from the onset of constructing a portfolio or as time goes on, how would such a strategy compare to going all-in on what has so far been considered one of the riskiest, most speculative assets of all time?\n\nThe answer is simple: Doing so would be \u201cselling the winner to buy the losers,\u201d as investor Michael Saylor has said.\n\nOn a five-year basis, BTC/USD is up 376%. Compare this to about 55% for the S&P 500 or gold.\n\n5-year chart of BTC, SPY and gold. Source: TradingView\n\nTaking profits from Bitcoin at any point in time and putting them into other assets would have decimated a portfolio\u2019s potential. Income from dividends doesn\u2019t compensate, except for those working with multimillion-dollar portfolios. And even then, the potential income would be dwarfed by the capital gains of holding a large Bitcoin position.\n\nWhile the concept of \u201crisk\u201d often implies volatility and potential downside, what about the risk associated with \u201cplaying it safe?\u201d Some argue that investors should also be concerned about the potential of their portfolios to barely keep pace with the rate of inflation, which has become a significant risk in recent years.\n\nRelated: CPI meets low BTC supply \u2014 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week\n\nMacro trends to consider\n\nProponents of Bitcoin and the DCA strategy have long since contended that BTC serves as the ultimate hedge against monetary inflation and overall financial market uncertainty.\n\nDespite critics\u2019 best efforts aimed at destroying this narrative, it has prevailed.\n\nLook no further than the banking collapses of 2023 and Bitcoin\u2019s resulting rally for proof. Furthermore, while the saying \u201cso much for an inflation hedge\u201d became popular in 2022 as BTC fell sharply from its all-time high, that idea strangely seemed to go by the wayside in 2023.\n\nYTD chart of BTC/USD.

More likely, it simply lies dormant for a time.\n\nSlow and steady wins the race\n\nFor many Bitcoin and crypto cynics, no amount of evidence will alter their convictions. Once a Ponzi scheme, always a Ponzi scheme, in their view. But hodlers have taken the orange pill and seen the truth while reaping the just rewards.\n\nWhile Bitcoiners can invite others to the cause, no one can force a worldview on another. Even if that view has long since become self-evident.\n\nBTC is up 87% year-to-date. Still, the price remains 44% beneath the all-time high of $69,000. The next halving is less than one year away, projected for May 2024.\n\nFollowing this event, along with the prospect of increased institutional adoption in the immediate future, it\u2019s widely anticipated that the Bitcoin price could reach six-figure territory and beyond during this cycle.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, July 11, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ault Alliance, Inc. (NYSE American: AULT), a diversified holding company, (\"Ault Alliance\" or the \"Company\"), announced today that it plans to explore a pathway that will allow it to issue a special dividend payable in Bitcoin to stockholders.

The Company has not yet determined what procedures would be required to permit stockholders to receive a dividend in Bitcoin, and even if the Company is able to pay a special dividend in Bitcoin, there are no guarantees that all stockholders will be permitted by their local governmental bodies to receive the dividend in Bitcoin.\n\nAult Alliance notes that all estimates and other projections are subject to the volatility in Bitcoin market price, the fluctuation in the mining difficulty level, the ability to build out and provide the necessary power for miners, and other factors that may impact the results of Bitcoin mining production or operations.\n\nFor more information on Ault Alliance and its subsidiaries, Ault Alliance recommends that stockholders, investors, and any other interested parties read Ault Alliance\u2019s public filings and press releases available under the Investor Relations section at https://www.ault.com/ or available at https://www.sec.gov/.\n\nAbout Ault Alliance, Inc.\n\nAult Alliance, Inc. is a diversified holding company pursuing growth by acquiring undervalued businesses and disruptive technologies with a global impact.

Hut 8's Bitcoin production for the period equated to an average daily production rate of approximately 3.7 BTC. This figure marked a modest increase from the 103 Bitcoins mined in August.

This decline has led analysts to question the profitability of Bitcoin mining, especially in the face of challenges like increasing competition and regulatory changes.\n\nHut 8's Q2 revenue plummeted from USD $44 million in the same period last year to USD $19 million, marking a steep decline of 56% year-over-year. This is a reflection of the company's struggles during the quarter. In addition, the company's Bitcoin mining output saw a significant reduction of 58%, with only 399 Bitcoins mined in the quarter.\n\nHut 8 faced various operational challenges during the quarter that contributed to its revenue and mining output decline. The company reported a drop in profit from mining operations, which drastically fell from USD $14.9 million in the second quarter of 2022 to USD $3.2 million."

        "content": "Berenberg Capital Market's bull case for Michael Saylor's Microstrategy is underpinned by the upcoming Bitcoin halving, the firm said in a research note shared with The Block Monday.\n\nThe equity research shop, which has a bullish price target of $430 for the Virginia-based software firm, said in the note that the firm derives most of its value from the more than 150,000 bitcoin it holds on its balance sheet, adding that it expects the historical trend of bitcoin rallying post-halving to play out again.\n\nHalving events reduce the rate of new coin issuance by 50%, effectively decelerating the pace at which new tokens enter the market. The fourth Bitcoin halving is expected to occur on April 26, 2024.\n\nPre-halving rally\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\n\"If the historical pattern established by the first three bitcoin halvings continues to play out with the fourth halving, then the pre-halving rally would begin about four months from now,\" the firm wrote. \"If a rally were to occur after the fourth halving, and if it were as long-lived as the rallies that occurred after the past couple of halvings, then it would continue until around October 2025.\"\n\n\"If the fourth bitcoin halving features the kind of strong rally in the price of bitcoin that occurred prior to and following the first three halvings, then we believe it is likely that MSTR\u2019s stock would rally along with it; the correlation between the company\u2019s share price and the price of bitcoin is ~0.90,\" the firm added.\n\nMicrostrategy is up more than 181% since the beginning of the year, according to TradingView. It increased 7% on Monday to close the day at $407.71."

        "title": "Better Bitcoin Stock: Riot Platforms vs. Marathon Digital - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Riot Platforms (RIOT 0.95%) and Marathon Digital (MARA -2.43%) are two of the largest pure play Bitcoin (BTC -0.11%) miners in America. Both stocks hit their all-time highs in 2021 as Bitcoin's price skyrocketed, but they stumbled over the past two years as rising interest rates crushed the cryptocurrency market.\n\nI compared these two stocks last June and called Riot the better buy because it faced fewer regulatory headwinds and had a healthier balance sheet. Riot's stock has risen nearly 150% since then, while Marathon's stock has advanced about 80%. Let's see why Riot outperformed Marathon -- and if it's still the better bet on the Bitcoin market.\n\nSimilar business models, similar challenges\n\nRiot and Marathon weren't originally Bitcoin miners. Riot was once a medical device maker called Bioptix, while Marathon was originally a patent holding company. Both companies abandoned those original business models, ordered thousands of top-tier Antminers from Bitmain, and rebranded themselves as pure play Bitcoin miners.\n\nRiot had deployed 95,904 miners by the end of June, which gave it a total hash rate capacity (or the overall efficiency of its mining operations) of 10.7 EH/s (exahashes per second). Just over a year ago, it had claimed it could deploy 120,150 miners to generate a total hash rate capacity of 12.8 EH/s by January 2023.\n\nMarathon had deployed 149,900 miners as of July 1, with a total hash rate capacity of 17.7 EH/s. However, that also missed its own target of deploying 199,000 miners to generate a total hash rate capacity of 23.3 EH/s by \"early 2023.\"\n\nRiot and Marathon both adopted a more conservative approach toward expanding their mining fleets as rising interest rates made Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related stocks a lot less appealing. Adverse weather conditions also boosted energy prices in recent months and forced both companies to mine fewer Bitcoins -- even as Bitcoin's price rose by 40% over the past 12 months. From May to June, Riot and Marathon mined 32% and 21% fewer Bitcoins, respectively, on a month-over-month basis.\n\nAfter initially hoarding their mined Bitcoins, both companies started to liquidate some of them to raise fresh cash over the past year. In June, Riot sold 400 of the 460 Bitcoins it mined, while Marathon sold 700 of its 979 mined Bitcoins.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2023, Riot held $129 million in unrestricted cash and $202 million in Bitcoin on its balance sheet, while Marathon held $114 million in unrestricted cash and approximately $380 million in Bitcoin holdings.\n\nMarathon still has the same old weaknesses\n\nRiot and Marathon seem fundamentally similar, but only Marathon is being actively probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2021, the SEC started to probe Marathon's joint venture with Beowulf Energy, which had been established to secure favorable energy rates for its data centers in Hardin, Montana. The SEC took issue with Marathon's usage of its own restricted shares instead of cash to fund that deal. This May, Marathon disclosed that it had received another SEC subpoena related to that joint venture. If Marathon is forced to end its partnership with Beowulf, its energy costs could surge.\n\nMarathon also ended its latest quarter with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.3, mainly due to the $733 million in convertible notes on its balance sheet, while Riot had a much lower ratio of 0.1. That higher leverage could make Marathon less appealing in this volatile market.\n\nBoth companies racked up steep losses last year\n\nRiot's revenue surged from $12 million in 2020 to $213 million in 2021, then grew another 22% to $259 million in 2022. However, its net loss widened from $14 million in 2020 to $15 million in 2021, then ballooned to $510 million as the crypto winter dragged on and energy costs soared. But for 2023, analysts expect its revenue to rise 46% to $379 million as it narrows its net loss to $146 million.\n\nMarathon's revenue soared from $4 million in 2020 to $159 million in 2021, but declined 26% to $118 million in 2022. Its net loss more than tripled from $10 million in 2020 to $37 million in 2021, then widened to a staggering $687 million in 2022. But on the bright side, analysts expect Marathon's revenue to more than triple to $424 million in 2023 as it brings two new plants online and launches a new joint venture in Abu Dhabi. It's also expected to generate a net profit of $33 million.\n\nThat ambitious expansion -- funded by a lot of the cash it raised through its recent convertible note offerings -- could offset many of its aforementioned weaknesses.\n\nThe valuations and verdict\n\nRiot trades at seven times this year's sales, while Marathon has a lower ratio of 6. I'd rather directly buy Bitcoin than either of these capital-intensive Bitcoin miners right now, but Marathon is still a better pick than Riot for four simple reasons. It's holding more Bitcoin, it has a bigger fleet of miners, it's executing bolder expansion plans, and its stock is cheaper."

The US central bank is likely to raise them further and keep them there, ProChain Capital's David Tamil told Fox Business in a recent interview.\n\n\"It is going to crush some very interest-rate sensitive industries such as real estate,\" he said about that prospect. \"I think we're going to see a multi-year, maybe decade-long fallout, first on commercial and then we will eventually get to housing.\"\n\nHigher rates lift mortgage rates, making it more expensive to buy a home using debt. They also raise interest costs for property developers. As a result, they tend to weaken demand for real estate, pulling down prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican households have been squeezed by historic inflation and higher interest payments on their mortgages, credit cards, car loans, and other debts. Yet home prices are still up about 40% since the COVID-19 pandemic struck in the spring of 2020, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller Index.\n\nIt's only a matter of time before higher interest rates sap demand and home values fall, at least in Tamil's view. He also spies danger in the debt-fueled commercial real estate sector, which faces the prospect of not only greater borrowing costs and lower asset values, but also a credit crunch as lenders pull back in fear of more bank runs and further declines in their bond and property portfolios.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the crypto investor is far more bullish on bitcoin. The most popular coin's price is likely to end the year up 66% at a two-year high of $50,000, he said.\n\nTamil rooted his prediction in the rising interest among asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity in offering bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is going to be a tectonic shift for the use of cryptocurrencies to go ahead and represent ownership of assets,\" he said."

        "title": "Will Bitcoin Go Back Up? Comprehensive Analysis By Traders Union - FinSMEs",
        "content": "Bitcoin, a name that rings bells of triumph for some while causing apprehension for others, has made its mark in the financial sphere.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that Bitcoin\u2019s rollercoaster ride has raised countless eyebrows, leading many to question, \u201cWill Bitcoin go back up?\u201d This question is pivotal to both budding investors and experienced traders. Traders Union, a highly regarded entity in the trading world, has shed some light on this topic.\n\nHaving uncovered the dynamics behind the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, Traders Union revealed: will Bitcoin go back up? Indeed, the answer lies in understanding this unique asset\u2019s risks, opportunities, and market behavior.\n\nIs Bitcoin a good investment today?\n\nAccording to Traders Union experts, Bitcoin is undeniably a good investment today. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin\u2019s value has soared exponentially, defying conventional market dynamics and asserting itself as one of today\u2019s best-performing assets. Its robust performance stems from its decentralized nature, limited supply, and immunity to traditional economic forces like inflation. Although the market is experiencing a correction phase after Bitcoin\u2019s price surpassed $60,000, history shows it tends to display high growth rates, making it a promising long-term investment.\n\nWhy investing in Bitcoin is a good idea\n\nTraders Union experts point to several reasons for considering Bitcoin as a good investment. First, Bitcoin\u2019s price has significantly corrected, indicating a good buying opportunity. Second, the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin adds reliability and credibility to its name. The success of the Bitcoin Lightning network also contributes to Bitcoin\u2019s appeal, with lower transaction costs compared to traditional systems like Visa. The potential value of Bitcoin as a digital gold, the halving cycle that makes Bitcoin scarce, the bull cycle theory, and its benchmark status among cryptocurrencies all contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s potential as an investment.\n\nWhy investing in Bitcoin might be a problem\n\nHowever, Traders Union experts caution that potential investors must also know the risks. Regulatory concerns loom as some countries have banned Bitcoin usage. There is also the fear of a potential recession that could significantly affect newer assets like Bitcoin. The divided forecasts about Bitcoin\u2019s future price add to the risk, forcing investors to carefully analyze different opinions before making decisions.\n\nHow much should I invest in Bitcoin?\n\nAs per the Traders Union experts, the size of your Bitcoin investment depends on your financial capabilities and risk appetite. Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s recommended that investors only allocate a small portion of their portfolio to this asset class. As a rule of thumb, investing more than 10% of the total long-term investment capital in one cryptocurrency is not advised.\n\nIs investing $100 or $1000 in Bitcoin enough?\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin requires strategic planning. Traders Union suggests adopting a steady strategy by investing a fixed monthly amount, whether that\u2019s $20, $100, or $1000. Significantly, one should never invest more than they can afford to lose. Bitcoin\u2019s volatility and limited liquidity mean small investments may not allow for portfolio diversification, potentially leading to riskier trading decisions. Therefore, carefully consider your financial capabilities before entering the Bitcoin market.\n\nIn addition to the Bitcoin forecast and whether it will go up or not, the Traders Union has also reviewed and published the XAUUSD forecast. To read the forecast and know in-depth, please visit the official website of the Traders Union.\n\nHow long should I keep Bitcoin?\n\nTU experts suggest that the duration for which one should hold Bitcoin depends on their individual situation and objectives. Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, go through bearish and sideways cycles that typically last 2-3 years. During a bear market, it is crucial to exercise patience as the market may eventually rise. On the other hand, it is often recommended to consider selling when the market is euphoric.\n\nLong-term holders may benefit from holding Bitcoin for an extended period. As time progresses, more people become interested in obtaining BTC due to its limited supply, leading to increased liquidity in the form of buy/sell orders. This could potentially result in capital appreciation over the long term.\n\nAlternatively, shorter-term traders may aim to capitalize on quick market movements. By buying low and selling high with enough frequency, they can potentially generate profits from the volatility of the market. Ultimately, the decision of how long to hold Bitcoin depends on the type of investor you are and your specific investment goals.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe question, \u201cWill Bitcoin go back up?\u201d is complex and requires careful consideration of various factors. Bitcoin has proven its worth as an investment in the past, but like any asset, it carries potential risks. Therefore, investing in Bitcoin is crucial to understanding the market dynamics, keeping abreast of regulatory changes, and considering one\u2019s financial capabilities and risk appetite.\n\nIf you\u2019re still pondering, \u201cwill Bitcoin go back up?\u201d Traders Union could be your guide through the complex world of cryptocurrency. Encouraging you to deepen your understanding, we invite you to visit Traders Union\u2019s official website to learn more about Bitcoin and other trading opportunities."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAccording to analysts, the next pre-halving surge for Bitcoin might start within the next four months\n\nNearly all of the largest Bitcoin investors saw an increase in their share values of more than 80% in just 30 days\n\nIt is anticipated that the price of Bitcoin will continue to rise both before and after each Bitcoin halving, as it has in the past\n\nThe imminent Bitcoin halving is expected to provide equities with a focus on Bitcoin\u2019s new momentum, including Michael Saylor\u2019s tech company MicroStrategy.\n\nBerenberg Puts Bullish Price Target For Microstrategy\n\nBerenberg Capital Markets, a New York-based investment company with a $430 price objective for MicroStrategy (MSTR), outlined its rationale for having a strong outlook in its research report.\n\nThe analysts assert that MicroStrategy derives most of its worth from the 152,333 Bitcoin it has on hand as of June 28 and add that a rally for the Bitcoin halving could result in a big price increase for its shares.\n\n\u201c[It] is our expectation that the price of Bitcoin will repeat its historical pattern of rallying both ahead of and following each Bitcoin halving.\u201d\n\nLast Bitcoin ETF decision deadline: 3/19/24 Bitcoin halving estimate: 4/16/24 \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/8zxcp8TQsh \u2014 Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) July 10, 2023\n\n\u201cIf the historical pattern established by the first three bitcoin halvings continues to play out with the fourth halving, then the pre-halving rally would begin about four months from now,\u201d the report says\n\nThe 50% reduction in BTC issuance rate due to the April 26, 2024, Bitcoin halving would drastically slow the rate at which new Bitcoin enters the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAs Berenberg points out, the price of Bitcoin has increased by at least 682% over previous rounds of halving. The price of Bitcoin circled at $12 on November 28, 2012, when the first halving occurred.\n\nIts price reached its peak at $1,164 367 days later.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s supply follows a \u201cpredetermined path,\u201d the researchers pointed out that the entire demand for Bitcoin needed to be assessed before anybody could estimate the \u201cpotential magnitude\u201d of a future rise.\n\nAs evidence that institutional adoption of Bitcoin is increasing, the report used the recent jump in spot Bitcoin ETF applications from some of the world\u2019s \u201clargest and highest-profile\u201d asset managers.\n\nAccording to TradingView statistics, MicroStrategy shares are currently trading for $407.17, having increased by roughly 180% since the start of 2023. In the meantime, the cost of Bitcoin has risen by 84% since the year\u2019s beginning.\n\nMicrostrategy \u2013 the Biggest BTC Holder\n\nA few weeks ago, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance was set to reach 80% in the long term as regulators crack down on other assets; MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor then confirmed that MicroStrategy is the largest public holder of BTC.\n\nSaylor explained that since 2020, Bitcoin has been the sole institutional-grade investable asset in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, according to MicroStrategy\u2019s view. According to him, Bitcoin is a digital commodity that is accepted universally and internationally.\n\nSaylor thinks that stablecoins, crypto securities, and crypto derivatives do not have a \u201clegitimate path forward\u201d in the eyes of authorities. In its actions against Binance and Coinbase, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declared 19 cryptocurrency assets as securities last month.\n\nCompanies Who Are the Biggest Bitcoin Holders\n\nMicroStrategy, Inc.\n\nThe company\u2019s investment had an entry value of $3.975 billion. The company holds approximately 152,333 BTC . Saylor is optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term potential and sure that the investment would be profitable.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings\n\nMarathon is a cryptocurrency mining corporation with a market cap of $225 million as of today and 12,538 Bitcoins with an entry value of $150 million. The shares jumped 81.35% in the last month.\n\nCoinbase Global Inc.\n\nCoinbase, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, is no stranger to the Bitcoin community. With an entrance value of $173.7 million and a current worth of $201.6 million, the corporation currently has approximately 9,000 BTC. In the last month, the shares of the crypto exchange jumped over 60%.\n\nSquare Inc.\n\nWith an entrance value of $220 million and a current worth of $179.8 million, the financial services and mobile payment company currently possesses 8,027 BTC . Similar to Coinbase, Square has made a modest investment in Bitcoin compared to other companies on this list, but it is obvious that Square believes the cryptocurrency market has potential. The jump within the last 30 days was around 7%.\n\nHut 8 Mining Corp.\n\nAnother cryptocurrency mining business that has diversified its holdings by purchasing Bitcoin is Hut 8. Approximately 9,136 BTC is held by the corporation. The shares of this company skyrocketed within the last 30 days by more than 95%.\n\nBlockchain Hive\n\nA cryptocurrency mining business called Hive Blockchain has operations in Sweden and Canada. With a current worth of $69.2 million, the corporation now possesses approximately 3,091 Bitcoin. Blockchain Hive shares jumped almost 90% in the last month.\n\nNEXON Co., Ltd.\n\nJapanese video game developer NEXON has been in business since 1994. At the time of writing, the corporation has 1,717 BTC, valued at $38,458,825 on the market. Bitcoin is one of the non-gaming sectors that NEXON has invested in as part of its diversification strategy. With a market valuation of more than $20 billion, the corporation is in a good financial position.\n\nVoyager Digital LTD.\n\nA Canadian cryptocurrency dealer named Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The corporation has 1,239 BTC as of March 2023, valued at $27,752,175 at today\u2019s market rates.\n\nBinance\n\nData tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows the balance held in Binance\u2019s wallets has increased by more than 52,000 BTC ($1.5 billion) in four weeks, taking the tally to 692,880 BTC. The global tally (coins held on all centralized exchanges) has increased by more than 27,000 BTC.\n\nDespite concerns voiced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), CEO Changpeng Zhao has confirmed the company\u2019s support for Voyager\u2019s acquisition by Binance US.\n\nConclusion\n\nPublic firms are becoming more aware of the benefits of Bitcoin investments and holding, and astute investors can participate without abandoning the stock market. Investing in any of the aforementioned businesses will give you indirect access to the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThese top 10 players have proven they are willing to investigate investment opportunities and take calculated risks in the ever changing bitcoin market. What remains to be seen is how these businesses will modify and develop their investing strategies once Bitcoin firmly establishes its status as a mature asset."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAfter the summit in Miami, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. invested up to $250,000 in Bitcoin\n\nHis comments in May that he was not an investor in Bitcoin disagree with the most current investment disclosure\n\nKennedy is a fervent supporter of Bitcoin and has received backing from some well-known figures in the cryptocurrency world\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democratic presidential contender, admitted to owning a sizeable quantity of Bitcoin after originally denying it and giving the cryptocurrency to his wife. Nevertheless, his campaign claims that there is no conflict of interest.\n\nNo Conflict of Interest in Owning BTC\n\nKennedy gave a keynote speech at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami in May and lauded Bitcoin, saying the network should be nourished and safeguarded. He added that Bitcoin donations would be accepted for his campaign. But he also made it clear to conference attendees that he did not own Bitcoin and that his support for the asset did not constitute investing advice.\n\nKennedy also compared his position to that of the current U.S. president and cited Biden\u2019s proposed 30% excise tax on cryptocurrency miners, arguing it would require a \u201cinvasive surveillance apparatus to monitor what is happening in individual computers\u201d and would be unwise to set such a precedent.\n\nKennedy\u2019s family does, however, appear to have between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin in a brokerage account as of June 30, according to a financial declaration acquired by CNBC. According to the report, which does not specify when the transaction was made, Kennedy\u2019s family earned less than $201 from the purchase.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich, Kennedy\u2019s campaign manager, commented that there was no conflict of interest and that the purchase happened following Kennedy\u2019s supportive comments about Bitcoin in Miami.\n\nFollowing the article\u2019s publication, Kennedy\u2019s campaign initially informed the public that the Bitcoin belonged to Kennedy\u2019s wife, Cheryl Hines, who is well-known for her work on the television program \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm.\u201d Later, a Kennedy campaign official clarified that they were wrong and that Kennedy actually did own the Bitcoin investment.\n\nOld Bitcoin Proponent\n\nWhile Vivek Ramaswamy and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have both made an effort to court the Bitcoin vote, Kennedy has been a steadfast backer of Bitcoin among Democratic contenders.\n\nKennedy has tweeted less frequently about Bitcoin since Miami, and the subject was not brought up during his lengthy one-on-one interview with Twitter CEO Elon Musk last month. Nevertheless, Kennedy has occasionally continued to support the oldest cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin, he claimed on June 27, \u201cis not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and the manipulation of our money supply, but it also points the way toward a future in which governmental institutions are more open and democratic.\u201d\n\nAs president, I will make sure that your right to use and hold Bitcoin is inviolable. Bitcoin is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and the manipulation of our money supply, it points the way toward a future in which government institutions are more transparent and more\u2026 pic.twitter.com/rPkMARieYu \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) June 27, 2023\n\nSome well-known figures in the cryptocurrency world have favor Kennedy, including Block CEO Jack Dorsey, who declared last month that Kennedy \u201ccan and will\u201d defeat DeSantis or Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nKennedy would first need to defeat President Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary for it to occur. According to a recent Echelon Insights study, 65% of people would support Biden over Kennedy, who would be chosen by only 14% of respondents.\n\nWhat Other Presidential Candidates Think of Bitcoin (Crypto)?\n\n\u201cNo fundamental value,\u201d \u2013 Joe Biden, Democrat\n\nJoe Biden, the current president of the United States, launched his reelection campaign on April 25. He is currently the likely favorite to be the Democratic Party\u2019s choice for president.\n\nThe 2023 Economic Report of the President, which includes a section on cryptocurrency for the first time since it started in 1950, may best capture Biden\u2019s perspective on cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe purpose of this section was to refute the \u201cPerceived Appeal of Crypto Assets.\u201d It suggested that many of cryptocurrency\u2019s \u201ctouted\u201d benefits are unattainable and that \u201cmany of them have no fundamental value.\u201d\n\nBiden has advocated against what he calls \u201ctax loopholes\u201d for cryptocurrency and even opposed a deal with Republicans to raise the debt ceiling because, in his words, it protected \u201cwealthy tax cheats and crypto traders.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t have to guess what MAGA House Republicans value. They\u2019re telling us. pic.twitter.com/BM6JGMEFeq \u2014 President Biden (@POTUS) May 9, 2023\n\n\u201cNot a Fan of Bitcoin\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump, a Republican\n\nOn November 15, 2022, the former president turned NFT salesperson Trump threw in the towel on his non-consecutive reelection bid. According to recent polling, he is the Republican nominee with the most support.\n\nCryptocurrencies, according to Trump, \u201cmay be fake\u201d and are \u201ca disaster waiting to happen.\u201d Additionally, he has stated that Bitcoin \u201cjust seems like a scam\u201d and that he doesn\u2019t like it \u201cbecause it is another currency competing against the dollar.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a tweet in July 2019 that he was \u201cnot a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\u201d and that their value was \u201cbased on thin air.\u201d However, Trum seems to be loving NFTs as his wife Melania has recently introduced a fresh line of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) based on famous American sites.\n\nI am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity\u2026. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019\n\n\u201cEvery right to do Bitcoin\u201d \u2013 Ron DeSantis, Republican\n\nIn announcing his presidential candidacy on Twitter on May 24, Ron DeSantis pledged to \u201cprotect\u201d Bitcoin. Prior to his declaration, the Florida governor was rated as Trump\u2019s second favorite in polls.\n\nDeSantis declared during the launch of his Twitter campaign that \u201cYou have every right to do Bitcoin\u201d and that he would \u201cprotect the ability to do things like Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe criticized Congress, saying it \u201cnever addressed\u201d cryptocurrency, and said that regulators had made it so \u201cthat people can not operate in that space.\u201d\n\nWill you require any presidential candidate to support your right to #Bitcoin before they can earn your vote? \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) May 27, 2023\n\nBitcoin shouldn\u2019t be treated like a Security \u2013 Vivek Ramaswamy, Republican\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, the founder of a pharmaceutical company, has also expressed support for cryptocurrencies but is thought to be a long shot to win the party\u2019s candidacy.\n\nRamaswamy stated on Twitter in mid-May that \u201cBitcoin should not be regulated as a security.\u201d He made the announcement that he will take Bitcoin donations for his campaign at the Bitcoin 2023 conference.\n\nCompetition breeds innovation. Bitcoin should not be regulated as a security. Will explain more at the @TheBitcoinConf on Saturday. @Bitcoin #Bitcoin #Bitcoin2023 pic.twitter.com/CtMPxIwsMR \u2014 Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) May 17, 2023"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets, including Tether (USDT), are currently trading at an 8% discount on Binance.US, a situation attributed to liquidity issues on the platform following a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nData from Binance.US shows that BTC is trading at $27,705.59 at the time of writing, around $3000 less than it sells on rival platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, BitStamp, and others.\n\nMeanwhile, this discount is also pronounced on other digital assets like Ethereum (ETH), USDT, Solana (SOL), and others, according to Coingecko data.\n\nBinance US troubles\n\nSince the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Binance.US on June 5, the exchange\u2019s market depth has fallen by almost 80% as market makers exited the platform.\n\nFollowing the legal troubles, the exchange discontinued U.S. dollar deposits after its banking partners abruptly halted their payment channels and transitioned to a crypto-only platform. Blockchain analytical firm Kaiko reported that this issue greatly affected Binance.US\u2019 reputation, and its market share fell to less than 1%.\n\nSince then, the exchange has experienced high volatility with its USD pairs, with BTC spiking to as high as $138,000 on June 21. Before that, Bitcoin had traded at a 3% discount in May.\n\nMeanwhile, assets paired with stablecoins like USDT and USDC are trading at regular prices, according to data from Coingecko.\n\nTether CTO addresses USDT trading on Binance.US\n\nTether CTO Paolo Ardoino addressed concerns that USDT had deviated from its dollar peg. He highlighted that the deviation is exclusive to Binance.US, where a general -8% spread appears to affect all cryptocurrencies on the platform.\n\nAccording to Ardoino, the situation was caused by the legal challenges Binance.US was currently facing. He wrote:\n\n\u201cBinance.US is going through some legal challenges so it probably doesn\u2019t have many market makers willing to arbitrage at this moment in time. On Binance.com USDt is trading 1bps above the dollar.\u201d\n\nThe Tether CTO further added:\n\n\u201cTether is in charge of its primary market (http://tether.to). Market making secondary markets (crypto exchanges) is the role of arbitrageurs and market makering professionals.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

Source: Binance.US\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $27,536 on the exchange against the U.S. dollar, which is around an 8.5% discount from global spot USD prices of $30,106 at the time of writing.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies are also trading at a discount in U.S. dollar terms. Ethereum prices are around $200 cheaper on Binance.US, trading for $1,695 at the time of writing. Some stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT), were also trading below their pegs with Tether at $0.915 on the exchange.\n\nWOAH.

Effectively, this means that the discounted cryptocurrencies can only be bought with any USD already sitting on the account before the suspensions.\n\nConcerns that Binance.US will soon halt USD withdrawals have also led to some users trading their cryptocurrencies below market value in order to exit their positions in USD.\n\nAccording to an email from Binance.US to customers, which has circulated on Twitter, the last day for USD withdrawals will be July 20.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin priced on Binance\u200b.US crypto exchange at $700 premium\n\nIn late May, a similar situation occurred relating to the Australian dollar at the Australian branch of Binance when the company\u2019s third-party payments provider shuttered fiat on- and off-ramps.\n\nThe price of BTC on Binance fell 20% compared to global spot prices when traded against the Australian dollar.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin' (BTC) hash rate hit a new all-time high over the weekend, meaning that it becomes increasingly difficult for any individual or group to control more than 50% of the network\u2019s total computational power.\n\nAccording to data from Bitinfocharts, Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate spiked to 465 EH/s on Saturday from 406 EH/s on the previous day.\n\nDespite the value dropping almost 6% to 428 EH/s on Sunday, the world\u2019s leading blockchain network\u2019s hash rate is still at its highest levels.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin hash rate chart. Source: Bitinfocharts.\n\nIn the world of Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, the hash rate stands as a critical metric, unveiling the health and security of the network. It serves as a measure of the estimated computational power committed to supporting the Bitcoin ecosystem, encompassing crucial activities like mining, key generation, and block validation. By analyzing the hash rate, one can gain insights into the network's resilience against hostile takeovers, particularly the dreaded 51% attack, where an entity gains control over the majority of the network's computing power.\n\nA higher hash rate directly correlates with a more robust and secure network, creating formidable barriers for anyone attempting to compromise its integrity.\n\nAs the hash rate escalates, the level of difficulty for potential attacks increases exponentially, making the network increasingly impervious to malicious actors.\n\nWhile bringing more security to the network, an elevated hash rate, however, comes with certain trade-offs for miners. These include increased competition and the need to allocate additional resources for more powerful mining hardware and cooling systems, which may also result in higher energy consumption.\n\nTo compensate for the growing expanses, miners can sell the coins they produce, although dropping prices means they need to sell more Bitcoin for the same face value.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency was changing hands at $30,164, down 0.4% over the last day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin's hash rate surging?\n\nOne potential reason for the latest Bitcoin hash rate surge is that Texas-based miners \u201care back at full (or near full) capacity,\u201d according to a Hash Rate Index report.\n\nPointing to recent heatwaves in Texas, the report says that the scorching temperatures still turned out to be \u201ctoo weak to cause substantial problems\u201d to the state\u2019s electricity grid, meaning that miners could resume their operations as normal.\n\n\"The hash rate continues to rise as miners are replacing older hardware with newer and more efficient machines in anticipation of the upcoming halving. This means hash rate is still rising without the requirement for new locations and more power,\" Henrike Christin M\u00fcller, Investor Relations Manager at Northern Data told Decrypt. \"Moreover, the YTD increase in the BTC price also drives further hash rate expansion by miners globally.\"\n\nThis development is also likely to result in the growth in Bitcoin mining difficulty, added the report, forecasting an anticipated adjustment that is due later this week above 7.5%.\n\nMining difficulty is the value representing the computational power required to mine a single Bitcoin. It\u2019s adjusted roughly every two weeks, getting more difficult as more miners enter the network and easier when they leave.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of other miners around the world who are expanding capacity when/if they can, so the growth isn't only coming from Texas,\u201d said the report's authors. \u201cWherever it's coming from, the end result is the same: the next difficulty adjustment is going to be a f** whopper.\u201d\n\nAfter three consecutive positive adjustments, Bitcoin mining difficulty fell 3.26% on June 29, according to BTC.com.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOne of the world\u2019s most popular video games can now earn players Bitcoin, thanks to a new Minecraft integration facilitated by Bitcoin-centric payments startup, Zebedee.\n\nSatlantis, a Bitcoin-themed Minecraft server operated by community members, has integrated Zebedee\u2019s Lightning Network-enabled gaming tech, letting players earn Bitcoin for playing. It works with the Java edition of Minecraft on computers, and players can withdraw their earnings to the ZBD wallet app on iOS or Android.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s an unofficial integration of Bitcoin tech that isn\u2019t endorsed by Minecraft developer Mojang or publisher Microsoft. The Satlantis server is broadly inspired by the leading cryptocurrency, with gameplay elements inspired by Bitcoin mining rigs and mining pool collectives, plus the ability to boost your mining \u201chash rate\u201d to have a better chance of winning Bitcoin in-game.\n\n@Minecraft, meet #Bitcoin \ud83d\udfe7\ud83e\udde1 Introducing @PlaySatlantis, where you can earn real bitcoin in the world's most popular game.

Satlantis is giving out over 1 million satoshis per week, according to Zebedee, which is 1% of a Bitcoin\u2014in other words, it\u2019s just over $300 total per week worth of Bitcoin. A satoshi is the smallest unit of measure for a Bitcoin; each Bitcoin contains 100 million satoshis.\n\nBut that\u2019s pretty typical for games and apps that reward players with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. Games like Sweet Bitcoin and Ethereum Blast that Decrypt has reviewed typically pay out about a few cents\u2019 worth of cryptocurrency per hour of play.\n\nIn addition to various mobile games that use Zebedee\u2019s gaming tech, the firm also previously launched specialized Bitcoin-earning servers for another major traditional gaming smash: Valve\u2019s squad-based shooter, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Zebedee enabled Bitcoin wagering and rewards in that game back in 2021.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t the first time that Minecraft has crossed paths with Bitcoin, either. Years back, a now-shuttered server called BitQuest let players find and collect small amounts of Bitcoin, which could be spent in-game. Other fan-run Minecraft servers have experimented with NFT and crypto integrations in the past.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, Microsoft plans to crack down on such integrations. In July 2022, the tech giant announced that it planned to ban NFTs from all Minecraft servers, stating that NFT-based token-gated features are \u201cnot inclusive of all our community and create a scenario of the haves and the have-nots.\u201d\n\nOne year later, Microsoft still hasn\u2019t updated Minecraft\u2019s terms and conditions to reflect the expected NFT ban. In June, however, a Microsoft representative confirmed to Decrypt that Minecraft still plans to follow through with the move.\n\nDespite Minecraft\u2019s NFT ban not yet becoming official, some fan-run servers and derivative projects either shut down or changed course. NFT Worlds, a project that sold NFT-based land plots for a dedicated Minecraft server, ultimately opted to create its own similar game instead.\n\nMinecraft\u2019s original news post about the planned ban also mentioned \u201cother blockchain technologies,\u201d which could include cryptocurrency. A Satlantis representative suggested to Decrypt that it is unconcerned, given that larger, more established servers already violate Minecraft's end user licensing agreement (EULA).\n\n\"The EULA is quite restrictive actually, but from our research, it seems to be more of a defensive contract that Mojang can use in case of any issues that an individual server runs into,\" they said. \"They do not seem to enforce it unless compelled to, as there are many large servers with 10,000+ players that go against said rules.\"\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to include comments from Satlantis."

        "content": "Bitcoin price may hit as much as $120,000 by the end of 2024, almost quadruple the current price, expect analysts at Standard Chartered as increasingly cash-rich miners reduce their sales of the token.\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market value, was trading 1.18% higher at $30,495.67 on Tuesday. The coin has rallied more than 82% this year so far, but is still below its record high of nearly $69,000 hit in November 2021.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin hits 13-month high, trading at $31,500\n\n\u201cIncreased miner profitability per BTC mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,\" Geoff Kendrick at Standard Chartered wrote.\n\nIn April, Standard Chartered forecast that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 per coin by the end of next year. That underestimated the impact higher miner profitability would have on reducing the supply of Bitcoin in the marketplace, they now say, and expect the price to hit $50,000 by the end of this year before jumping to as much as $120,000 in 2024, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\u201cAt recent prices, they (miners) have been selling 100% of new BTC; at USD 50,000 we think they would sell 20-30%,\" Kendrick wrote.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin, Coinbase Are Soaring Despite Obstacles Facing Spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nMoreover, the upcoming \u201chalving\" in 2024 will add to the supply pressures. Halving is a preprogrammed event that reduces the supply of Bitcoin rewards available to miners from about 900 per day to about 450. Halving occurs every four years and keeps Bitcoin below its limit of 21 million tokens.\n\nThe recent rally in the Bitcoin prices along with the broader cryptocurrency market came on the back of multiple filings for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US, including an application by BlackRock Inc.\n\nRead here: BlackRock refiles Bitcoin ETF application naming Coinbase as surveillance sharing partner\n\nBitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process in which miners use powerful computers to validate transaction data on the Bitcoin blockchain, keeping the network running and earning the token as a reward.\n\nThey profit by selling the awarded Bitcoin into the market. When Bitcoin prices are higher miners can cover costs selling fewer Bitcoin, holding on to more in the expectation of higher prices in the future, Bloomberg report said.\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "content": "The Mining Future\n\nDUBAI, UAE , July 11, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Mining Future, a leading provider of Bitcoin and crypto mining hosting services, is spearheading the evolution of the mining industry by offering cost-effective hosting solutions and unparalleled accessibility to crypto enthusiasts worldwide. With the cryptocurrency landscape rapidly evolving over the past couple of years, The Mining Future has emerged as a frontrunner in the industry, revolutionizing the way mining operations are conducted.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina, the USA, and the EU have long dominated the Bitcoin hosting and crypto mining scene, but rising costs and regulatory challenges have led miners to seek alternative jurisdictions. In this context, The Mining Future has strategically established its headquarters in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to capitalize on the country\u2019s ambitious vision to become a global leader in the crypto industry. The UAE\u2019s commitment to fostering crypto-friendly regulations, inviting startups and miners within its jurisdiction, and making significant investments to secure its position as a hub for crypto companies have been instrumental in The Mining Future\u2019s decision to choose the UAE as its base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe believe that the UAE\u2019s proactive approach to regulation and its commitment to supporting the growth of the crypto industry aligns perfectly with our vision for The Mining Future,\u201d said a spokesperson of The Mining Future. \u201cBy operating from the UAE, we can offer our clients a secure and reliable hosting environment while tapping into the country\u2019s thriving crypto ecosystem.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to their presence in the UAE, The Mining Future is expanding its operations by opening two new state-of-the-art data centers in the Dominican Republic and in Kuwait. This move reflects the company\u2019s commitment to securing clean energy sources and providing its clients with significantly lower rates than the market average. The Mining Future\u2019s dedication to finding optimal energy solutions ensures that Bitcoin mining hosting operations remain environmentally sustainable while maximizing profitability for miners.\n\nStory continues\n\n\n\n\n\nOne notable aspect that sets The Mining Future apart from its competitors is its emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity. The company\u2019s commitment to democratizing the Bitcoin mining network is evident in its policy of accepting a minimum order quantity (MOQ) of just one miner, compared to the industry-standard MOQ of >10 miners. This approach empowers individuals from all walks of life, regardless of their geographical location, to participate in the Bitcoin mining network and contribute to its decentralization.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further enhance the customer experience, The Mining Future offers a wide range of ASIC and GPU miners, including popular models . By maintaining transparency throughout the purchasing and hosting process, The Mining Future ensures that clients are equipped with the necessary knowledge and support to make informed decisions. The company\u2019s dedicated customer service team provides personalized assistance and consulting services to support both experienced miners and those new to the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs The Mining Future continues to expand its global presence, their current and new data centers with available capacity in Dominican Republic, Dubai and Kuwait provide an ideal hosting environment for miners seeking cost-effective solutions. Compared to the average hosting costs in China, the USA, and the EU, The Mining Future offers highly competitive rates without compromising on the quality and reliability of their services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Mining Future:\n\nFounded in 2021 by Gilbert Corbella and Miquel Angel Corbella, also known as the Corbella Brothers, The Mining Future FZCO was born out of a quest for a solution in a post-pandemic world where traditional investment avenues no longer provided sufficient returns to combat rising inflation. Recognizing the potential of Bitcoin mining as a lucrative investment opportunity, the Corbella Bros set up their own mining operations farm in Georgia, Europe, overcoming numerous challenges along the way. Eventually, their dedication and perseverance paid off, leading them to achieve financial independence.\n\nWith newfound financial freedom, the Corbella Bros embarked on a mission to share their success and transform the perception of Bitcoin mining. Acknowledging the industry\u2019s tarnished reputation and prevalent scams, they set out to destigmatize Bitcoin mining and make it transparent, accessible, and reliable for everyone. The Mining Future FZCO not only aims to cater to experienced investors but also offers retail investors the opportunity to acquire high-performing assets and enjoy regular passive incomes with the most prominent cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\nDriven by the vision of empowering individuals on their journey towards financial independence, The Mining Future FZCO strives to be the catalyst that propels investors towards their goals. By providing a trustworthy and profitable avenue for investment, the company aims to revolutionize the perception of Bitcoin mining and redefine its role as a viable and rewarding opportunity.\n\nWebsite: https://www.theminingfuture.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nOrdinals have already increased activity on the BTC blockchain while maintaining low fees\n\nBRC-69\u2019s creator\u2019s dream of creating an \u201cinternal internet\u201d might come true\n\nOrdinals are coming to Ethereum\n\nOrdinals, NFTs on the BTC blockchain made the headlines last week as it adopted a new protocol named BRC-69. The protocol utilizes a method called Recursive Inscription which allows users to make the most of the space provided on each block.\n\nOrdinals are now back in the headlines for their staggering success. Crypto analytics firms are reporting a huge increase in transaction rates on the BTC blockchain while maintaining transaction fees.\n\nWith such mass technology adoption, is it possible to achieve the dream predicted by BRC-69 creators?\n\nA Busy Day On The BlockChain\n\nAccording to Dune , Ordinals saw 385,920 inscriptions over the weekend, making it the second-busiest day ever for Ordinals. The busiest day for the NFTs was May 7th, which saw around 400,000 inscriptions.\n\nThe huge surge of activity on the blockchain is likely due to the introduction of BRC-69, a technology that allows users to bypass the 4-megabyte limit on each block. More importantly, the Dune dashboard recorded the average transaction fee to be around 2.5 BTC, which is a huge discount from previous inscription fees.\n\nBRC-69 Tl;Dr\n\nEvery block allows 4 megabytes of data to be stored. With the BTC blockchain gaining more users, blocks are becoming more scarce, and transaction fees are increasing over time.\n\nThe idea behind BRC-69 lies with recursive inscription. Recursive Inscription uses coding lines that allow blocks to retrieve information from other blocks. So, users may now use most of their block to store new information and utilize a fraction of the storage memory to insert an inscription that recalls data from another block, effectively giving it access to eight megabytes of data instead.\n\nThe technology doesn\u2019t just allow the recollection of data from a single block but from whatever number of blocks utilize recursive inscription. So, if 300,000 blocks use Ordinals BRC-69, a user may use recursive inscription to retrieve data from all of them, accessing Gigabytes of data through a mere 4-megabyte block.\n\nWTF are recursive inscriptions? Here is everything you need to know: Earlier this year the Ordinals Protocol introduced the ability for anyone to inscribe files fully on-chain onto Bitcoin. These inscriptions are self-contained and unaware of the other files that had been\u2026 pic.twitter.com/O3jt6lhaxT \u2014 Leonidas (@LeonidasNFT) June 12, 2023\n\nA New Bitcoin-based Internet?\n\n\u201cWe can think even bigger, though. What if lots of people upload lots of packages of code? So now there is a huge repository of packages for developers to build on top of. This would unlock powerful use cases that could never be done in under 4 MB. The most complex pieces of software are just a bunch of code compiled together, after all.\n\nNow it becomes possible to put a complex 3D video game on-chain on Bitcoin fully. The sky is the limit. Bitcoin is essentially getting an internal internet where every file can request data from the other files on Bitcoin,\u201d \u2013 reads the tweet above.\n\nEssentially the technology creator dreams of a Bitcoin-based network of information that would use recursive inscriptions to allow the creation of huge programs based on a single block.\n\nWith increased interest in Ordinals, BRC-69 is increasing the likelihood of such a future.\n\nORDI and OXBT, have partnered with Emblem to bring BRC-20 tokens to the Ethereum blockchain. While it is yet to provide a bridge for recursive inscription, it definitely increases the potential for such a future.\n\n\u2b1b\ufe0f\ud83d\udfe7 $ORDI and $OXBT MEGATHREAD \ud83d\udfe7\u2b1b\ufe0f \ud83d\ude80 VAULTING IS NOW LIVE \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udd38 How to Mint\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Where to Trade\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Vaulting Mechanics\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Details, Info, Integrations, and Partnerships pic.twitter.com/AANoZjTVxs \u2014 Emblem Vault (@EmblemVault) July 6, 2023"

The complaint against Grayscale aimed at having the asset manager stop plans to turn its GBTC trust into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) and provide documentation on its relationship with Digital Currency Group, Grayscale\u2019s parent company.\n\nFir Tree claimed that roughly 850,000 retail investors had been \u201charmed by Grayscale\u2019s shareholder-unfriendly actions\u201d based on the firm\u2019s lack of a redemption program from GBTC into cash or crypto. In addition, its legal team said Grayscale attempting to launch a spot crypto ETF could \u201ccost years of litigation, millions of dollars in legal fees, countless hours of lost management time, and goodwill with regulators.\u201d\n\nRelated: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust nears 2023 highs on BlackRock ETF filing as buyers step up\n\n\u201cOnce Grayscale provides Fir Tree with the GBTC documents that it has agreed to produce under this agreement, we will be able to further investigate Grayscale in order to determine our appropriate next steps, which may include filing additional litigation against Grayscale, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and their respective directors, officers, and advisors, or others who should be held accountable for destroying billions of dollars of GBTC\u2019s market value,\u201d said Fir Tree.\n\nGrayscale filed a legal challenge against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June 2022 after the regulator denied an application to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF. The lawsuit is ongoing, with the SEC having not approved any spot crypto investment vehicle despite applications pending from BlackRock and other investment firms.\n\nMagazine: Get your money back: The weird world of crypto litigation"

        "content": "A third straight week of positive digital asset inflows has fully corrected nine previous weeks of outflows for the market, according to a report from CoinShares published on July 10.\n\nThis week\u2019s inflows registered $136 million. Bitcoin (BTC) funds continued their trend of holding the anchor position, with 98% of the inflows coming into BTC. The other 2% mostly came into Ether (ETH), multi-asset holdings and a handful of altcoins.\n\nFund flows for the week ending July 7. Source: CoinShares\n\nAfter nine weeks in which digital asset outflows outpaced inflows, this third consecutive week of positive movement brings the current streak\u2019s total to $470 million. According to CoinShares, this total fully corrects for the previous outflow streak.\n\nThis brings the last 3 consecutive weeks inflows to US$470m, fully correcting the prior 9 weeks of outflows.\n\n\n\nTrading turnover has slowed though, which might be explained by the seasonal effects, where lower volumes are typically seen during July and August.\n\n\n\n2/6 pic.twitter.com/4uyvrY0aRP \u2014 CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) July 10, 2023\n\nBitcoin inflows showed no signs of slowing down this past week after posting yearlong highs in the previous two. As Cointelegraph previously reported, BTC inflows for last week were $123 million. This week adds $10 million, bringing the two-week inflow haul for BTC alone to $256 million.\n\nThis continues Bitcoin\u2019s crypto market dominance by extending its total market cap from last week\u2019s 51.46% to a reported 51.66% share as of July 11.\n\nIn other good news for hodlers, blockchain equities inflows reached a yearlong high of $15 million. This more than doubled last week\u2019s $6.8 million, which snapped a nine-week outflow streak of its own, according to CoinShares.\n\nHowever, there may be some indication of equilibrium on the horizon, as overall liquidity appears to be down. According to the report, trading volume has hit a \u201cseasonal low,\u201d imitating cycles from previous years that saw low liquidity in July and August.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin supply shock will send BTC price to $120K \u2014 Standard Chartered\n\nDespite the continuing positive news surrounding inflows, some investors appear to be getting nervous over the lack of a clear trend.\n\nPositive sentiment generated by the expectation that one or more companies would finally receive authorization from the United States government to offer BTC as a spot exchange-traded fund may be tapering off as the process wears on.\n\nThere also remains an air of uncertainty, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s ongoing litigation against Binance and Coinbase continues with no clear sign as to how the courts will decide.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

        "content": "According to Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, Bitcoin could experience a surge of up to 300%, reaching a valuation of $120,000 by the end of 2024. Kendrick\u2019s previous prediction in April was that Bitcoin would reach $100,000 by next year, but he now believes this estimate may be too conservative, taking into account the impact of miner profitability.\n\nYou may also be interested in reading: Cryptocurrency for Everyday Life in Latam\n\nKendrick attributes his more bullish stance to increased mining profitability. As miners find it more profitable to hold onto their Bitcoin rather than sell it immediately, the reduced supply of Bitcoin in the market can push prices higher. Kendrick estimates that in the second quarter, nearly 100% of all mined Bitcoin was sold, but he expects miners to gradually reduce their sales over time.\n\nTo illustrate this point, Kendrick explains that when Bitcoin\u2019s price surpasses the average all-in cash cost of mining, miners tend to sell fewer tokens. If the average BTC price in the first quarter of 2024 reaches $50,000 as predicted, the calculation of \u201cBTC minus all cash costs\u201d would rise to $30,000. Consequently, selling only 27% of the Bitcoin mined in Q1-2024 would generate the same excess cash as selling 100% in Q2-2023.\n\nReduced miner selling not only affects prices but also impacts the inflation rate of Bitcoin. By reducing the net supply of Bitcoin by approximately 250,000, the inflation rate could decrease from 1.7% to 0.4% year-over-year.\n\nThe recent increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price, with it surpassing $30,000, has been attributed to interest from Wall Street giants in creating Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This has led to other bullish predictions for the cryptocurrency, such as Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee forecasting a valuation of $200,000 in the coming years.\n\nThe profitability of mining has been rising as the cost to produce new Bitcoin decreases. Large-scale miners, including Riot and Core Scientific, have been cutting corporate costs, while energy prices have also declined. Additionally, halving events, which occur when the amount of Bitcoin produced by mining is halved, tend to lead to industry consolidation and further reduction in mining expenditures. The next halving event is expected to take place in April or May of 2024.\n\nYou may be interested: Fidelity seeks Bitcoin ETF with new SEC filing\n\nCripto LatAm-Adoption\n\n\" data-image-caption=\"\n\nCripto LatAm-Adoption\n\nWhy is it relevant for investment funds in Latin America?\n\nIf Bitcoin reaches the predicted levels, it is likely to attract the attention of investors and adopters in Latin America.

This provides a vast market for venture-backed startups, either locally or as an entry point to other markets in Latin America.\n\nThe region has shown a growing interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly due to factors such as the volatility of local currencies, limited access to traditional financial services, and the opportunity for more efficient and cost-effective international transactions.\n\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/contxto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/63aaee6fe473f385b2a9e91b_chart-2-defi-share-country-1024x695-1.png?fit=300%2C204&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/contxto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/63aaee6fe473f385b2a9e91b_chart-2-defi-share-country-1024x695-1.png?fit=1024%2C695&ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" >\n\nWe recommend: IMF Develops Global Platform for Central Bank Digital Currencies\n\nTo read the information in detail, visit: Reuters"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBritish multinational bank Standard Chartered has boosted its Bitcoin price forecast to $120,000 by the end of 2024\u2014a 300% leap from where it is today.\n\nIn a report viewed by Reuters, the bank predicted Bitcoin\u2019s rise will be driven largely by miners hoarding their coins and cutting off additions to Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply.\n\n\u201cIncreased miner profitability per BTC (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,\" wrote Geoff Kendrick, one of Standard Chartered\u2019s top FX analysts, in the report.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin is up 82% year to date, from $16,600 on January 1 to $30,280 at writing time. Since miners are rewarded with a fixed number of BTC (6.25) per block, such bullish price momentum has helped boost the industry\u2019s revenue since the start of the year, reversing negative momentum amid declining revenue in 2022.\n\nBitcoin Miner Revenue. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe opposite trend was visible in June of 2022, when BTC's falling price forced major miners like Core Scientific and Riot to dump the vast majority of their coins on the market, only contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s free fall to under $18,000.\n\nToday, miners have good reason to believe Bitcoin is back in an early upswing. Data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode shows that a large share of BTC has been moving hands from short-term holders to strong hands over the past few months, which is \u201c a primary component of all prior Bitcoin bull markets.\u201d Long-term holders are entities that haven\u2019t moved their coins for over 155 days and are generally less likely to be active (ex. be sold) in the near term.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin \u201cShrimps\u201d\u2014small entities with less than 1 BTC\u2014appear to be stacking sats harder than at any time since the peak of the late 2017 bull market. This cohort alone is sucking up more coins each month than miners can produce in their totality.\n\nAccording to Kendrick\u2019s estimates, miners are still selling 100% of their newly mined coins to cover costs. However, if Bitcoin\u2019s price rises to $50,000 by the end of the year, this share of sold coins might reduce to just 20-30%, reducing circulating supply and creating a bullish feedback loop.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n#Bitcoin Shrimp (< 1 $BTC) \ud83e\udd90 are stacking sats at a rate of 33.8k $BTC per month. Issuance \ud83d\udd35 is ~27.0k $BTC/mth For every 1 new coin, Shrimp are taking 1.25 off the market.

        "content": "Forget lists of words and alphanumeric strings: a new Bitcoin tool lets you hide the key to your coins inside a rainbow.\n\nBitcoin developer Entero Positivo launched \u201cBIP39Colors\u201d last month, an open-source tool that can convert one\u2019s BIP39 mnemonic phrase into a series of colors, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cWith this method, you can convert your 12-word phrase to 8 colors (or your 24-word phrase to 16 colors),\u201d explained Positivo to Decrypt via DM. \u201cThen you can convert your colors back to your original seed.\u201d\n\nBIP39 Colors translates a BIP39 mnemonic to colors and viceversa.

As Positivo explains, however, storing one\u2019s crypto as a list of 12 words is very obvious to hackers or thieves who come across the list.\n\nColors, by contrast, \"are everywhere.\" A private key could be hidden in plain sight, and a thief wouldn\u2019t be the wiser.\n\n\u201cA paper with 12 words is more suspicious than a color palette labeled like 'my new home wall colors,' for example, or inside a styles.css of your [website],\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe colors generated by the tool are expressed as a hex color code, a six-digit system that represents virtually any color as some combination of red, blue, and green. These colors can be stored across \u201cseveral files,\u201d Positivo explained, including HTML, CSS, or the color palette of a PNG.\n\nUnlike the word-based system, one need not remember the \u201corder\u201d of the colors to recover one\u2019s seed: all that matters is that all colors are present. The developer believes the flexibility of this storage method could make it more difficult for governments to seize someone's Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cYou can give one color to your mother, another inside your [website], another one written in a web design book... and in the future recover your seed from these agnostic colors,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\ud83d\udeab No, never enter your real seed in any online tool, please ! - Generate random seeds with Iancoleman tool for example ...\n\n- Play with this tool\n\n- If you consider usefull, download it and use it on a new installed offline computer, raspberry, TailsOS, #DTails, ...\n\n- And\u2026 \u2014 Entero Positivo (@EnteroPositivo) June 26, 2023\n\nThe developer also provided instructions for how to decode one\u2019s BIP39 colors back into their mnemonic phrase with only a calculator, not requiring any external tool."

        "content": "Litecoin\u2019s Strong Performance Before \u2018Halvening\u2019 Fuels Optimism for Bitcoin Rally\n\nLitecoin. Source: Adobe\n\nBitcoin (BTC) investors are closely watching the performance of Litecoin (LTC), another proof-of-work token, as the flagship cryptocurrency gears up for its upcoming \u201chalvening\u201d event.\n\nThe term \u201chalvening\u201d refers to the protocol-backed reduction in rewards for miners who successfully solve puzzles and add blocks to proof-of-work tokens like Litecoin and Bitcoin.\n\nThe Litecoin blockchain is poised to go through the halvening process in another 21 days, which is scheduled for August 1, 2023.\n\nThis reduction is designed to limit the number of tokens issued and has already caused a surge in Litecoin\u2019s price.\n\nOver the past month, the price of Litecoin has risen by 22%, while its 12-month performance shows an impressive 81% increase.\n\nThis performance has bolstered the confidence of Bitcoin investors who believe that the upcoming halvening event for Bitcoin, scheduled for April 2024, will have a similarly positive impact on the price of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin Price has Historically Reacted Positively to Halvenings\n\nBitcoin has historically experienced price increases following its halvenings, which occur every four years.\n\nThe reason for this trend lies in the fundamental principles of supply and demand.\n\nWith fewer new coins being minted, the existing supply becomes scarce. And as demand from investors and users continues to grow, this scarcity drives the price higher.\n\nThe first halvening in 2012 saw Bitcoin\u2019s price rise from around $12 to over $260 within a year.\n\nSimilarly, the second halvening in 2016 witnessed a surge from $650 to almost $20,000 by the end of 2017.\n\nThe most recent halvening occurred in May 2020 when the reward per block was reduced from 12.5 to 6.25 Bitcoins. While the immediate impact on the price was not as dramatic as previous halvenings, Bitcoin started an upward trend shortly after, reaching new all-time highs in 2021.\n\nBitcoin has also performed well since the start of the year.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, Bitcoin was trading at around $16,000. It has nearly doubled since then, recently hovering around $30,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency hit a 52-week high last month after BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed an application to create a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe filing by the world\u2019s largest asset manager also spurred a surge in ETF applications, with other firms, such as Fidelity, Valkyrie, and Invesco, submitting applications.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Litecoin received a significant boost when EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange backed by Citadel Securities, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab, announced that it would include them among the four tokens available to its customers at launch.\n\nNevertheless, as the countdown to Bitcoin\u2019s halvening in 2024 begins, industry watchers will be closely monitoring Litecoin as an indicator of what may lie ahead for the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency."

Where do these buyers currently stand at various price points, and how will the upcoming price movement impact their holdings?\n\nRead Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBitcoin accumulation at different range\n\nAs we examine the price movements of Bitcoin over the past year per Glassnode, an interesting pattern emerged. Initially, the cryptocurrency began the year at around $16,500, and during that period, approximately 637,000 BTC were purchased. The purchase accounted for roughly 3.71% of the total BTC in circulation.\n\nAs time progressed, and by the time March arrived, Bitcoin experienced a surge in price, reaching around $26,800. Approximately 523,000 BTC were acquired during this period, comprising 3.05% of the total supply.\n\nCurrently, around 592K #Bitcoin has a purchasing price of $30.2K the current spot price. This suggests small price fluctuations in either direction will send 3.45% of the circulating supply into a position of profit or loss respectively. ?

It\u2019s worth noting that approximately 592,000 BTC have been purchased at this price level, which accounted for approximately 3.45% of the total supply. What does this signify?\n\nIt implied that the BTC held by those who make up 3.5% of the total supply could swiftly transition from being profitable to incurring losses or vice versa, depending on the direction in which the price moves.\n\nLong and short-term Bitcoin holders hold at profit\n\nAnalyzing the Bitcoin 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) revealed an interesting trend. As of this writing, the 30-day MVRV was approximately 4.78%. This indicated that holders within this timeframe were currently holding their assets at a profit. This metric further suggested that even those who purchased their holdings at the current price range were still in a profitable position.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that these particular Bitcoin holders are also the ones most susceptible to the impact of price fluctuations in any direction.\n\nFurthermore, when the longer-term BTC MVRV was examined, specifically the 180-day MVRV, it became evident that holders within this timeframe enjoyed even greater profits. As of this writing, the 180-day MVRV was 11.9%. This indicated that these holders had amassed significant gains and were better positioned to withstand a price drop. Moreover, should the price of Bitcoin rise, they stand to benefit even more from their investments.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today\n\nBTC sees a positive trend\n\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $30,600 on a daily timeframe. While it had a profit of less than 1%, it was noteworthy that this marked the second consecutive day of trading in profit. Presently, Bitcoin was exhibiting an upward trend following its recent price movement.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to consider that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator indicated a bearish divergence. Despite the bearish divergence, the Relative Strength Index indicated a bullish trend."

        "content": "NEW YORK \u2013 Standard Chartered Bank is ramping up its bullish Bitcoin prediction, targeting as much as US$120,000 (S$161,000) by the end of 2024 \u2013 almost quadruple the current price \u2013 as increasingly cash-rich miners reduce their sales of the token.\n\n\u201cIncreased miner profitability per BTC mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,\u201d StanChart analyst Geoff Kendrick wrote on Monday, using the abbreviation for the digital currency.\n\nBitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process in which miners use powerful computers to validate transaction data on the Bitcoin blockchain, keeping the network running and earning the token as a reward.\n\nThey profit by selling the awarded Bitcoin into the market. When Bitcoin prices are higher, miners can cover costs selling fewer Bitcoin, holding on to more in the expectation of higher prices in the future.\n\nBold Bitcoin price predictions are nothing new. Among the most bullish is from Ark Investment Management founder Cathie Wood, who doubled down on her prediction that Bitcoin will hit US$1 million by 2030 as recently as November.\n\nStanChart forecast in April that Bitcoin could reach US$100,000 per coin by the end of 2024. This underestimated the impact that higher miner profitability would have on reducing the supply of Bitcoin in the marketplace, it now says, and expects the price to hit US$50,000 by the end of 2023 before jumping to as much as US$120,000 next year.\n\n\u201cAt recent prices, they (miners) have been selling 100 per cent of new BTC; at US$50,000 we think they would sell 20 per cent to 30 per cent,\u201d Mr Kendrick wrote.\n\nAdding to supply pressure is an upcoming \u201chalving\u201d in 2024, a preprogrammed event that will reduce the supply of Bitcoin rewards available to miners from about 900 a day to about 450. Occurring every four years, it keeps Bitcoin below its limit of 21 million tokens.\n\nBitcoin, the crypto sector\u2019s largest asset, was trading at US$30,309 as at 1.40pm in New York. Its 83 per cent gain in 2023 still leaves it well below its record high of nearly US$69,000 in November 2021.\n\nIts recent jump coincided with a raft of filings for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States, including an application by BlackRock, which has a near-pristine record of filing for and receiving approval for such funds.

        "content": "In the world of digital and cryptocurrencies, one has captured the attention of many like none other: Bitcoin. Since its advent in 2009, the Bitcoin price has seen soaring highs and heart-stopping lows. To say that Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility has been its hallmark would be an understatement. Today, we\u2019ll analyze the roller-coaster history of BTC\u2019s price and the key milestones that contributed to its rollercoaster ride over the years.\n\nThe Early Years: 2009-2011\n\nThe first exchange of Bitcoin for dollars was recorded in late 2009 by the New Liberty Standard Exchange. 5,050 Bitcoins were exchanged for $5.02 via PayPal. In other words, 1 Bitcoin was worth as much as 1/10th of a cent. Bitcoin stayed relatively steady from 2009 to 2011. Then in January 2011, the Bitcoin price surpassed $1 and hit an all-time high of $31 by June. However, this is where we saw this cryptocurrency\u2019s notable volatility when it plummeted to $2 within mere months. It\u2019s worth mentioning, however, that 2011 was when investors and early adopters started taking a considerable interest in Bitcoin and taking cryptocurrency seriously.\n\nMarket Maturity and Mt. Gox Exchange\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFollowing this, most of 2012 was spent recovering from this jolt, and Bitcoin ended 2012 at $13.50, at least better than how 2011 had ended. That\u2019s around when Mt.Gox, a Bitcoin exchange company accounting for over 70% of all Bitcoin transactions, made headlines and significantly impacted Bitcoin volatility.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, its price went up to $1100, only to crash to $200 after Mt. Gox collapsed due to a massive security breach and a 650,000 to 850,000 coin\u2019 loss. This event woke authorities and pressed on the need for investor security and regulations in cryptocurrency. It also taught everyone to exercise caution and diligence when engaging with cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Mainstream Recognition: 2015-2020\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, the Bitcoin price volatility remained relatively mute, fluctuating between $400-700. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency made headlines again in 2017 when it started the year off between $1000-2000. This was still slow enough, but the currency reached an all-time high of $19000 by mid-December. Having begun trading at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Bitcoin became extremely popular as its breakthrough year ended.\n\nHowever, this was followed by another downhill road when the year ended at about $3500, with an almost 70% decrease from the previous year. Factors such as regulatory crackdowns, scalability issues, and speculative trading played a role in this volatile phase until the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic 2020 and Beyond\n\nBitcoin was doing reasonably decent in the initial COVID-19 wave, at $10,000 during the year\u2019s first six weeks. However, once the pandemic was officially announced, it dropped by over 39% in just a single day in March. Cryptocurrency took just as much of a hit with the pandemic as any other industry. The price eventually surged, but it has been all up and down, and the uncertainty wouldn\u2019t stop. At the moment, Bitcoin traded for around $26,000 as of mid-June 2023, with a 50% increase in just half a month. However, who knows what will come next with how unstable it\u2019s been through the years?\n\nEndnote\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTo wrap up, the price volatility of Bitcoin has been a defining factor in its history from 2009 till today. There have been several unignorable price swings, such as the Mt. Gox exchange event or the rise in 2017 and 2020. These result from market sentiment, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. Understanding these trends throughout history can help investors and market participants determine when to invest and when not to."
