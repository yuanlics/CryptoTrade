        "title": "Bitcoin has now recovered all its losses since FTX collapsed - CNBC",
        "content": "Bitcoin has held steady above $21,000 for the last two days, bringing it back above the price it was when Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange, FTX , began its slide toward bankruptcy.\n\nSince Monday, bitcoin has largely held steady above $21,000, well above its Nov. 2 price of $20,283.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has jumped more than 22% in the last seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin fell by that same amount in less than a day, between Nov. 7 and Nov. 8, as investors struggled to assess the impact of a potential FTX collapse and the likelihood of a Binance-backed FTX bailout. It dipped below $16,000 several times in the following weeks."

        "content": "Well, that was quick. Less than two weeks after cryptocurrencies hit a nadir in the wake of the FTX collapse, Bitcoin has rallied 25% amid speculation the cryptocurrency selloff late last year was too much and too fast.\n\nKey Takeaways With Bitcoin gaining 25% and Ether jumping 20% in the past week, there's a bullish sentiment across the market.\n\nThe fall in inflation contributed to the recent rise in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nThe market has breached $1 trillion for the first time since the FTX collapse in November.\n\nBitcoin Gains Momentum\n\nWhen Consumer Price Index (CPI) report came last week that inflation is cooling off in most of the U.S. economy, Bitcoin hit a two-month high at $18,856, up 8%, as investors hoped that the Federal Reserve would reverse, or at least soften its rate hike policy. This suggests that Bitcoin is also becoming macro now, no longer a hedge against inflation.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin mining difficulty rose more than 10% to 37.59 trillion from 34.09 trillion on Sunday, a new all-time high. The difficulty of mining tends to increase when a blockchain network grows and is a sign of increased activity. The flagship cryptocurrency jumped traded at $21,130 at 11: 30 PM, New York time.\n\nEthereum Upgrade is on Horizon\n\nEther, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain network, gained over 17% in the past week, trading at $1,568 at 11: 30 PM, New York time. Apart from macroeconomic factors, the upcoming Shanghai upgrade on the network that allows users to withdraw their staked Ether has also contributed to this momentum.\n\nSimply put, the Shangahi upgrade follows 'The Merge' that shifted the Ethereum blockchain network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September 2022. A tentative timeline of March 2023 has been set for the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nBesides Bitcoin and Ethereum gains, Avalanche, NEAR, Aave, Polkadot, and Solana also surged over the past two weeks, helping the crypto market reclaim $1 trillion.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe surge in the market has given investors hope that crypto will continue to flourish despite layoffs and bankruptcy. Even a banking giant like Bank of America believes cryptos are the future and a new form of payment as it will likely change ''how and when value is transferred over the next 15 years.''\n\nAs the markets rebound, inflation cools, and signs of economic stability return, traders are optimistic about the resurgence of the crypto bull market.\n\n"

        "title": "Is crypto about to go extinct? - Al Jazeera English",
        "content": "It will likely survive, but only after more firms and currencies crash and burn. Here\u2019s why.\n\nAs the Los Angeles Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals in the championship game of the National Football League last February, an unlikely set of players made a splash off the field, in living rooms across the United States.\n\nOn one of American television\u2019s biggest nights, with 99 million viewers, the Super Bowl broadcast was punctuated by a series of cryptocurrency advertisements. Social media buzzed with talk of how digital tokens had come of age as they grabbed primetime slots previously dominated by mainstream giants like Coca-Cola and General Motors.\n\nOne of the advertisements that night had comedian Larry David playing a Luddite dismissing humankind\u2019s biggest inventions \u2013 from the wheel to Edison\u2019s lightbulb to, the commercial suggests, the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Told that the platform is a \u201csafe and easy way to get into crypto\u201d, David\u2019s character says: \u201cEhhh, I don\u2019t think so \u2013 and I\u2019m never wrong about this stuff.\u201d\n\nThat advertisement hasn\u2019t aged well.\n\nWith multiple big crypto firms collapsing in recent months, the sector that promised an alternative to the traditional global financial model now faces existential questions. In May last year, the TerraUSD and Luna coins crashed, losing almost all of their value overnight and wiping out $45bn from the crypto market in a day. Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital abruptly shut down. Crypto lenders Voyager Digital and Celsius Network \u2013 which had both loaned money to Three Arrows Capital \u2013 soon filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAnd in November, FTX \u2013 the popular crypto trading platform in the Super Bowl advertisement \u2013 imploded. Its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas in December and has been charged with fraud. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s best-known cryptocurrency, is today worth only a third of what it was at its peak in October 2021.\n\nThe FTX commercial with David ends with the tagline, \u201cDon\u2019t be like Larry.\u201d Today, many of the 420 million people estimated to have invested in crypto might well be wishing they had been more like Larry.\n\nSo is crypto about to go extinct?\n\nThe short answer: As a concept, cryptocurrencies will probably survive, experts told Al Jazeera. But the sector will likely face increased regulation and an extended period of uncertainty. Many firms and currencies will perish. To stay alive, companies will face one challenge above all else: winning back customer trust.\n\nCrypto \u2018ice age\u2019\n\nCryptocurrency trading platforms have traditionally drawn in customers with the promise of quick returns on investment. The offer: Park money in so-called crypto wallets \u2013 which are meant to function in a manner similar to savings bank accounts \u2013 and earn high interest rates, sometimes in double digits. For those who are distrustful of traditional finance, the opportunity to carry out transactions without worrying about a regulator as an intermediary is an added attraction.\n\nBut this allure dimmed once the US Federal Reserve and other major central banks around the world sharply raised interest rates through 2022, making more traditional investment options more lucrative than before. The US rate, for instance, shot up by more than 4 percentage points over the course of 2022.\n\nOnce TerraUSD and Luna went into freefall, a combination of safer alternatives and reduced trust in crypto led to a crisis that, according to experts, is far from over.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll see a lot more bad news before things start looking better for the sector,\u201d Tim Leung, director of the computational finance and risk management programme at the University of Washington in Seattle told Al Jazeera.\n\nWith many potential customers now sceptical, crypto platforms will likely witness low trading volumes for a while, Leung said. The crypto sector likes to pride itself on its independence, but it depends on financing from traditional markets. How much of that funding will continue in the current climate is unclear, Leung suggested. With reduced trading and less funding, many smaller firms might go belly up, he warned.\n\nCrypto mining companies, which generate virtual money \u2013 or coins \u2013 using energy-guzzling supercomputers, will suffer too, Leung said. Reduced demand for coins because of low trading volumes and high energy prices will squeeze the viability of their business model. \u201cI see this phase lasting through 2023,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely to be a crypto ice age rather than a crypto winter.\u201d\n\nThe downturn isn\u2019t surprising, suggested experts.\n\n\u201cThis is a start-up industry with hundreds of firms and lots of innovation,\u201d said David Yermack, professor of finance at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. He told Al Jazeera he expects a chaotic period for cryptocurrencies in the foreseeable future but thinks that \u201cultimately best practices will emerge through competition\u201d.\n\nGovernments around the world have signalled plans to step in to shield customers from that chaos. But regulators and analysts appear divided on how best to intervene.\n\nOld laws for new tech?\n\nGary Gensler, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), argued in September that existing laws are adequate for the crypto sector. In his view, he said, most cryptocurrencies are similar to traditional securities \u2013 tradable financial assets like stocks or bonds.\n\nHilary Allen, professor of law at American University in Washington, DC, agrees with that approach. Cryptocurrencies and trading platforms, she said, must meet the standards of governance that the SEC demands from old-school securities \u2013 including registering with the regulator and demonstrating transparency over assets \u2013 or be shut down.\n\nCreating new rules for the crypto industry would be wrong, she said. \u201cThat would legitimise the idea that crypto, somehow, is unique, and can\u2019t be expected to meet the same standards as mainstream financial assets,\u201d Allen told Al Jazeera. \u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous message to send.\u201d\n\nBut many other experts disagree.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental difference between securities and currencies,\u201d said Bruno Biais, a professor of finance at the HEC Paris business school. People invest in stocks or bonds based on the cash flow or assets of the company offering them, he said. They buy currency \u2013 whether a dollar, a euro or a crypto token \u2013 trusting that the coin or note will be accepted by others at a later date.\n\nTrying to fit an existing regulatory framework on cryptocurrencies without adapting it to new technology won\u2019t work, said Christian Catalini, founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Cryptoeconomics Lab.\n\nIt won\u2019t guarantee consumer protection, Catalini told Al Jazeera. \u201cWorse, it may kill the innovation potential of the space without any meaningful benefit to the public,\u201d he said.\n\nWhere most analysts do agree is that regulations for the sector must focus on one kind of cryptocurrency in particular: so-called stablecoins.\n\nMaking \u2018stablecoins\u2019 stable\n\nUnlike tokens like Bitcoin, whose price can fluctuate wildly, the value of stablecoins is pegged to a regular currency, like the US dollar or other traditional assets like gold. For instance, each Tether coin, the world\u2019s most popular stablecoin \u2013 which often trades even more than Bitcoin \u2013 is worth $1. That value stability positions stablecoins as tokens that, while still earning well through crypto wallets, are supposedly safer than other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThe very term, \u2018stablecoin\u2019, conjures the image of a reliable currency that gives customers a false sense of security,\u201d Biais told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe problem? Unlike regular currencies and banks, stablecoins are basically completely unregulated.\u201d\n\nSo while in theory, those who own $100 worth of stablecoins should be able to redeem that amount whenever they want \u2013 as would be the case with a banknote \u2013 there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll actually get that money back, said Biais.\n\nThe Financial Stability Board (FSB), a global advisory body set up by the G20 after the 2008 financial crisis, has been urging major economies to adopt regulations to ensure that stablecoins demonstrate their ability to pay customers back. In its October 2022 report, the FSB warned that many existing stablecoins \u201care issued by unregistered and unlicensed entities and do not have credible mechanisms to support their promise of price stability\u201d.\n\nWhile US regulators appear undecided on the need for new rules, many other nations and regions are moving towards laws specifically designed to govern the crypto sector and, in particular, stablecoins. These rules could help ensure that \u201cgood actors thrive, and bad actors disappear from the crypto ecosystem\u201d, said Catalini.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s new regulation, known as Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), will require all crypto firms to register with authorities. Stablecoins will need to guarantee assets to pay customers back at any time. MiCA comes into force in 2024.\n\nJapan passed a law last June under which only banks and other strictly regulated financial institutions can offer stablecoins. And the British government has proposed that the Financial Conduct Authority, the country\u2019s top financial services regulator, would have oversight over crypto firms.\n\nMeanwhile, India\u2019s finance minister has said that crypto regulations would be a priority of the country\u2019s G20 presidency in 2023. A global framework to regulate crypto is indeed essential, said Leung of the University of Washington, since many firms in the sector have a footprint across geographies.\n\nBut for any of this to help revive the industry, crypto firms will first need to regain the confidence of customers, said experts.\n\nMatter of trust\n\nMany crypto enthusiasts will likely watch to see how big cases of fraud, such as the one involving FTX, play out, said Biais of HEC Paris. If they see justice, and if those who have lost money because of such scams get it back, that would help rebuild trust, he said.\n\nSome experts, like Allen at American University, believe that crypto has little to meaningfully offer to the financial world in the future. \u201cWhen you peel away the rhetoric, there really isn\u2019t anything there that you can\u2019t do using traditional finance instruments,\u201d she said.\n\nOthers remain convinced that crypto, with its potential to enable peer-to-peer, decentralised financial exchanges, represents a transformational technology. \u201cThe technology is here to stay, even if a number of the initial projects in the crypto space are falling,\u201d MIT\u2019s Catalini said.\n\nHe described the moment as similar to the dot-com bubble that burst in the late 1990s when many early online firms went bust. Those \u2013 like Amazon \u2013 that survived or came up later are among \u201cthe internet giants of today\u201d, he said.\n\nStill, until the dust settles and reliable regulations come in, Leung at the University of Washington said it\u2019s best to be cautious. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to make decisions based on Super Bowl commercials,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game.\u201d"

        "title": "How is cryptocurrency valued? - TechTarget",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market can be volatile --\u00ad\u00ad sometimes reaching record highs and other times dropping significantly. Understanding how cryptocurrency is valued can help explain these changes.\n\nCryptocurrency is not the same as the U.S. dollar or the Euro because there is no central authority -- such as a government body -- to manage its value. Without a centralized organizing body, there are no concrete reasons for cryptocurrency to change in value.\n\nThe main theory behind cryptocurrency value is if enough people agree it is valuable, then it becomes more valuable. Without regulation, demand can cause fluctuations -- and in some cases, the changes can be extreme -- depending on additional factors such as availability, utility and competition.\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is a digital and encrypted asset that is used for exchange. It can be used similarly to fiat currencies to exchange for goods, services and investments. Fiat currencies are government-issued -- such as the current money system people use every day. Cryptocurrency is different from digital currency. Digital currency can be turned into cash by going to an ATM or bank because it is backed by a financial institution. With cryptocurrency, transactions are recorded on the blockchain and are not verified by a financial institution like digital currency. The blockchain is a financial ledger or database that stores electronic information digitally to show ownership. Users can exchange cryptocurrency directly with others. Here are the four types of blockchain technology.\n\nHistory of cryptocurrency The idea of cryptocurrency originated in the 1980s. The idea was to send currency that could not be traced and didn't require centralization. David Chaum -- an American cryptographer -- created anonymous money called DigiCash. It was the first form of electronic payment requiring software and encrypted keys to send and withdraw money. Next, came Bit Gold, which is often considered the precursor to Bitcoin. Nick Szabo designed it in 1998, and it required solving a puzzle to get the reward. When these two concepts are put together, they are similar to Bitcoin. In 1998, Satoshi Nakamoto published Bitcoin \u2013 A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, a white paper that described the blockchain network and its technology. He described Bitcoin as \"an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.\" He also said in this paper that cryptocurrency would not be possible without blockchain technology. Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first bitcoin in 2009. The first block of 50 bitcoin -- known as the Genesis Block -- had no real value for the first few months. Then in April 2021, the value of one bitcoin reached 14 cents. The value then surged to 36 cents in November 2021. Bitcoin began to steadily rise. With publicity in publications such as Forbes, prices started to increase. Other forms of cryptocurrency then started to be created, using blockchain technology. Now there are several different types of cryptocurrency with new ones emerging regularly. Other well-known cryptocurrencies include the following: The main theory behind cryptocurrency value is if enough people agree it is valuable, then it becomes more valuable. Ethereum\n\nDogecoin\n\nTether\n\nXRP\n\nSolana\n\nPolkaDot\n\nCardano\n\nShiba Inu\n\nBinance Coin\n\nUSD Coin Learn more about the history of blockchain technology here.\n\nCost of production Mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency tokens. This process involves using software to verify the block on the blockchain to decentralize and form the token. To verify the blockchain, participants need to use computing power and solve transaction-related algorithms. However, there is a competition to mine certain cryptocurrencies largely due to the miners racing each other to verify the next block, which can make it more difficult to mine. The cost to mine increases when more powerful equipment is needed, which can be costly. Higher mining costs push up the value of the cryptocurrency to offset the costs of production. Because the costs are high, attackers use cryptojacking with unauthorized use of other systems to mine cryptocurrency for the power demands. Cryptojacking can also be completed by a cryptomining bot installed on a target system.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges The more popular cryptocurrencies, such as Ether and Bitcoin, are available to trade on multiple exchanges. The smaller tokens may only be on certain exchanges, which limits access. If a cryptocurrency is listed on more exchanges, they will be available to more investors, which can increase the demand. To purchase cryptocurrency, users need to create an account on a cryptocurrency broker, such as Coinbase, eToro or Gemini. Opening an account on these exchanges is similar to opening any other investment account. If a user wants to exchange one cryptocurrency for another, this is possible using cross-chain bridges. It's similar to the exchange between different country currencies. There are several cross-chain bridges to help explore various blockchain ecosystems. Learn more about the best cross-chain bridges available here. After purchasing cryptocurrency, the next step is storage. Since they are not backed, they are at risk for theft. There are three methods to store cryptocurrency. Leave cryptocurrency in exchange. After buying the cryptocurrency, the exchanges have a cryptocurrency wallet to store purchases. This method is the most at-risk for theft because the exchange markets are a prime target for thieves. For example, in February 2022, thieves stole more than $320 million on the Wormhole cryptocurrency platform. Hot wallets. These cryptocurrency wallets are stored online outside of the exchange. They run on all internet devices and run a risk of theft since they are stored online. In addition, there are apps for smartphones to store cryptocurrency, and these are also considered hot wallets. Cold wallets. Unlike hot wallets, cold wallets are stored offline on an external device. All the information is stored within this device making it the safest option. But don't lose the keycode, or it may be difficult to get the cryptocurrency back. Learn more about securing a bitcoin wallet here.\n\nHow does cryptocurrency gain value? In the stock market, a company's worth is determined by multiplying the stock price by the number of shares to show market capitalization. The price of the stock can go up or down depending on supply and demand. Higher demand stock have higher prices, such as Apple and Amazon. The same theory applies to cryptocurrency. Higher demand pushes prices up. If demand goes higher than the amount available, the price of that cryptocurrency increases. Some cryptocurrencies have a maximum supply and only increase by a fixed amount, such as bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies \u2013 such as Ether \u2013 do not have supply limitations. Demand for cryptocurrency depends on many factors, including how useful the coins are and if businesses accept them. There are other factors that also determine the value of cryptocurrency, including the following: Mining. When trying to create the new block, miners compete for that encrypted number, and the first miner wins the newly minted cryptocurrency. Mining can be expensive, especially with the amount of electricity needed to complete it.\n\nWhen trying to create the new block, miners compete for that encrypted number, and the first miner wins the newly minted cryptocurrency. Mining can be expensive, especially with the amount of electricity needed to complete it. Increasing utility. Utility increases when businesses accept cryptocurrency and if there is an investment opportunity. Being able to use it in decentralized finance protocols or decentralized apps can also affect value. Think about an Amazon gift card versus a small store gift card -- there are more options for the Amazon gift card, giving it more utility.\n\nUtility increases when businesses accept cryptocurrency and if there is an investment opportunity.

Some investors appreciate the freedom of no regulations while others fear the lack of regulation and security. Availability. If the cryptocurrency is more readily available on numerous exchanges, it may be more valuable.\n\nRegulations and governance Developers adapt projects based on current and future use. However, governance tokens require stakeholders to give consensus for any changes. Investors like stable governance, and this can be considered a flaw with cryptocurrency. There is volatility in its value and it can make severe swings. For example, bitcoin's value fell below $20,000 in June 2022 after hitting a high of $68,789.63 in 2021. There is some uncertainty in terms of the regulation of cryptocurrencies. There is confusion on whether cryptocurrency is a commodity, such as gold or silver, or a security, such as stocks or bonds. Because of this indecision, neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission can regulate cryptocurrency. Regulations could have a positive impact because investors would feel more secure about purchasing cryptocurrency as an investment. However, regulations could also negatively affect the value of cryptocurrency by lowering the demand and changing rules for investments. Learn more about a Senate bill to regulate cryptocurrency."

        "content": "How does Bitcoin DeFi work? Wrapped tokens like Wrapped Bitcoin, layer-1 blockchains like Stacks, and sidechains like Rootstock enable DeFi on Bitcoin. The scripting language used by Bitcoin, termed Script, is not Turing complete, which means it is deficient in several logical operations, such as loops. As a result, the Bitcoin network supports limited programmability despite the Taproot upgrade, meaning that Bitcoin DeFi platforms rely on layer-2 scaling solutions and sidechains to host their smart contracts. DeFi on Bitcoin is made possible through wrapped tokens like Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), layer-1 blockchains like Stacks and sidechains like Rootstock. For instance, wBTC, an Ethereum token introduced in January 2019, is backed one-to-one by Bitcoin (BTC), meaning that one wBTC is always equivalent to 1 BTC. Users can engage with several of Ethereum\u2019s DApps using the wBTC token. An independent layer-1 blockchain called Stacks makes hundreds of billions of dollars in capital in BTC available and offers Bitcoin holders new ways to use and profit from the cryptocurrency. It uses a proof-of-transfer consensus mechanism, which secures its blockchain by utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work blockchain. DeFi products like the Stackswap DEX leverage the Stacks blockchain to allow users to trade and mint NFTs, borrow algorithmic stablecoins, and launch and exchange tokens on the Bitcoin network. Additionally, since Stacks and Bitcoin are linked, NFTs created on Stacks settle to and are secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. Turing-complete smart contracts are made possible on the Bitcoin blockchain by Rootstock, which runs parallel to the blockchain. When BTC is sent to Rootstock, it transforms into RBTC, a smart contract-enabled Bitcoin. Based on bidirectional communication, this protocol serves as a bridge to connect both chains. For instance, Sovryn, one of the first permissionless financial apps, utilizes RSK\u2019s technology to connect to the Lightning Network, Ethereum, Bitcoin and BNB Smart Chain.\n\nWhich DeFi projects are part of the Bitcoin ecosystem? Besides wBTC, Stacks and Rootstock, BadgerDAO, RenVM and Liquid Network promote various use cases of Bitcoin DeFi. BadgerDAO A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called BadgerDAO makes it possible for BTC to be utilized as collateral across various DApps. The BadgerDAO uses the Ethereum-based token BADGER for protocol governance and incentive distribution. Users can earn income on their synthetic BTC assets using Sett Vaults, the first product offered by Badger. Users can lock up their tokenized Bitcoin in SETTs, which are pools of tokens, and let smart contracts manage their holdings to produce a yield in the form of bTokens. The second product from Badger, called Digg, is software that controls the elastic-supply cryptocurrency called the DIGG token, pegged to the price of BTC in United States dollars. Like any other token, DIGG can be deposited into SETTs to provide a yield for its holders and used in DeFi protocols. RenVM The decentralized Ethereum protocol Ren creates tokens that monitor the value of non-Ethereum assets such as Bitcoin and offers liquidity to projects on several blockchains. That said, Bitcoin holders may utilize Ren (needed to pay nodes) to access Ethereum\u2019s array of DeFi products without selling their BTC or moving their assets across blockchains. The Ren virtual machine holds the original funds in storage, accepts tokens from one blockchain, and generates new tokens on another through its RenBridge to exchange assets between blockchains. For example, a user may submit BTC to the RenVM, which would issue renBTC, a new token on Ethereum that would reflect the original Bitcoin, meaning when the user wants to get their Bitcoin back, the transaction may be reversed. Liquid Network The Liquid Network is a layer-2 Bitcoin solution and an inter-exchange settlement network that enables the issue of digital assets like security tokens, stablecoins and other financial instruments privately and quickly on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. LBTC, a wrapped version of Bitcoin, serves as the native token on the Liquid sidechain. Users send BTC to a Lightning Network address (a process called peg-in) on the Bitcoin network to use the Liquid Network. A similar quantity of LBTC is minted on the Liquid Network and delivered to the user\u2019s address after the transaction has received 102 confirmations. In addition, peg-out can be initiated to withdraw BTC by sending LBTC for burning to an irrecoverable address, which, when receiving two separate confirmations, lets a Lightning Network member send the original BTC to a user\u2019s Bitcoin network address."

        "content": "Glassnode data analyzed by CryptoSlate shows that Marathon, Hut8, and Riot built the top three largest Bitcoin (BTC) pools, while Bit Digital recorded a 134% growth in reserves in nine months.\n\nBTC miners in 2022\n\nBTC miners entered the year 2022 with resources acquired through cheap debt in 2021. The majority of them invested these resources into growing their ASICS, which kept increasing their BTC holdings until May.\n\nHowever, the bear market started in May introduced immense pressure and led to distribution across miners. The Russian-Ukraine war increased energy costs, the BTC price fell, and the hash rate increased, which heated the competition for block space.\n\nDistribution emerged as the main theme for BTC miners in the second half of 2022. However, the BTC volume in exchanges didn\u2019t grow. Throughout the whole year, less than 60,000 BTC got sent to exchanges.\n\nYear-end reserves\n\nMarathon, Hut8, and Riot became the top three companies with the largest total BTC holdings, with 12,232 BTC, 9,086 BTC, and 6,952 BTC, respectively.\n\nMarathon\u2019s holdings account for 27.7% of the combined BTC pool of the top nine mining companies, while Hut8 and Riot account for 20.4% and 17.5%, respectively.\n\nTop 9 Companies\n\nCryptoSlate analyzed the top nine BTC mining companies in detail. Marathon, Hut8, HIVE, Riot, and Bit Digital ended the year by growing their holdings.\n\nHowever, Bit Digital recorded the most impressive growth in mining capabilities throughout the year. Bit Digital started its operations in April and mined 754 BTC in the first month. For the rest of the year, the company recorded a 134% growth in reserves and reached 1,765 in December.\n\nMarathon started the year with 8,595 BTC, recorded a 42% increase, and saw 12,232 BTC in December. The 5,826 BTC Hut8 had in January increased to 9,086 by December, reflecting an almost 56% increase. Finally, HIVE\u2019s January reserves were at 2,043 BTC, which grew by 14.9% throughout the year and reached 2,348 BTC in December.\n\nBitfarms entered the year with 4,600 BTC and recorded a 91% decrease by falling to 405 BTC in December. Similarly, Argo held 2,748 BTC in January, which fell to 141 BTC in December, marking a 94.8% decrease. CleanSpark\u2018s BTC reserves fell by 51%, falling from January\u2019s 471 to December\u2019s 228. Finally, Core Scientific couldn\u2019t survive the winter. The company entered the year with 6,373 BTC and went bankrupt in December.\n\nFirst two weeks of 2023\n\nThe year 2023 started with the least amount of selling pressure of the past three years. The chart below represents the flow of BTC from miner wallets to exchanges.\n\nAccording to the data, only 88 BTC got sent to exchanges in the last two weeks.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA number of factors are behind bitcoin's New Year rise, according to analysts, including an increased probability of interest rates being lowered and purchases by large buyers known as \"whales.\" Filip Radwanski | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin has begun 2023 on a positive note, with the price of the world's largest digital token up roughly 28% since the start of January. On Saturday, bitcoin's price rose above $21,000 per coin for the first time since Nov. 7. It's still a far cry from the $68,990 record high bitcoin notched in Nov. 2021. But it has given market players cause for some optimism. The month-to-date rally follows a grim 2022, which saw major insolvencies and scandals in the crypto industry, including the collapse of FTX, and a sharp pullback in the broader market linked to central bank actions. Analysts say that a number of factors are behind bitcoin's New Year rise, including an increased probability of interest rates being lowered, as well as purchases by large buyers known as \"whales.\"\n\nNew Year, new monetary policy?\n\nInflation is cooling down, and economic indicators suggest slowing U.S. economic activity. That's made traders optimistic the Federal Reserve could reverse, or at least soften, its rate hiking strategy.\n\nwatch now\n\nLast week, fresh U.S. inflation data showed a modest retreat, with the consumer price index decreasing 0.1% in December on a monthly basis, in line with Dow Jones estimates. \"Bitcoin looks to have recoupled with macro data as investors shrug off the FTX collapse,\" James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset management firm CoinShares, told CNBC by email. \"The most important macro data investors are focussing on is the weak services PMI and the trending down of employment and wage data. This coupled with downwards trend in inflation has led to improving confidence, while it comes at a time when valuations for Bitcoin ... are close to all time lows. The prospect of looser monetary policy off the back of weaker macro data and low valuations is what has led this rally.\" The Fed lifted borrowing rates seven times in 2022, forcing risky assets such as stocks \u2014 and tech stocks, in particular \u2014 into a tailspin. In December, the bank's benchmark funds rate increased to 4.25%-4.50%, reaching its highest level since 2007. Bitcoin has been caught up in the market drama around lending rates, as it is increasingly viewed by investors as a risky asset. Backers previously talked up bitcoin's potential as a \"hedge\" to buy in times of high inflation. But bitcoin failed to achieve that aim in 2022, instead slipping more than 60% as the U.S. and other major economies grappled with higher rates and living costs. Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank, said in a Jan. 13 note that this was \"brewing a hope amongst market participants that the Fed will further slow down on the pace of rate hikes.\"\n\nThe Fed is likely to keep interest rates high for the time being. However, some market players are hopeful that central banks will start easing the pace of rate rises, or even slash rates. Some economists predict a Fed rate cut could happen as soon as this year. That's as the risk of a recession is also playing on central bankers' minds. Some two-thirds of chief economists surveyed by the World Economic Forum believe a global recession is likely in 2023, according to research released by the Davos organizer on Monday. The U.S. dollar has also sagged, with the greenback down 9% against a basket of currencies used by U.S. trade partners in the last three months. The majority of bitcoin trades against USD, making a weaker dollar better for bitcoin. \"We are seeing the dollar put in a top, inflation easing, interest rate hikes slowing down - all pointing to markets getting more risk-on over the next few months,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC.\n\n'Whales' buying BTC\n\nLarger purchasers of digital coins known as \"whales\" may be leading the latest rally in bitcoin, according to Kaiko. The crypto data firm said in a series of tweets Monday that trade sizes had climbed from an average of $700 on Jan. 8 to $1,100 today on the crypto exchange Binance, indicating renewed confidence in the market by whales.\n\nwatch now\n\nWhales are investors who've hoarded large piles of bitcoin. Some are individuals, like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor and Silicon Valley investor Tim Draper. Others are entities such as market makers, which act as the middlemen in trades between buyers and sellers. Skeptics of digital currencies say this makes the market prone to manipulation by a select few investors with large piles of tokens. The wealthiest 97 bitcoin wallet addresses account for 14.15% of the total supply, according to fintech firm River Financial. In December, Carol Alexander, a professor at the University of Sussex, told CNBC that bitcoin could see a \"managed bull market\" in 2023 in which bitcoin travels north of $30,000 in the first quarter, and to $50,000 in the second half. Her reasoning was that with trading volumes evaporating, and the level of fear in the market extremely high, whales would then step in to prop up the market.\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty rising\n\nThere are other factors at play, as well. Several bitcoin miners have been flushed out by the drop in prices. Bitcoin miners, who use power-intensive machines to verify transactions and mint new tokens, have been squeezed by the slump in prices and rising energy costs. That's historically a good sign for bitcoin, according to Ayyar.\n\nwatch now\n\nThese actors accumulate massive piles of digital currency, making them some of the biggest sellers in the market. With miners offloading their holdings to pay off debts, that removes much of the remaining selling pressure on bitcoin. More recently, however, bitcoin's network \"difficulty\" has been increasing, meaning more computing power is being deployed to unleash new tokens into circulation. Mining difficulty reached a record 37.6 trillion on Sunday, according to BTC.com data, meaning that, on average, it would take 37.6 trillion hashes, or attempts, to find a valid bitcoin block and add it to the blockchain. \"Bitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to create the next block of transactions,\" said Marcus Sotiriou, market analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock, in a note Monday. \"Bitcoin mining difficulty fell 3.6% before the last update, after a winter storm led some miners to shut down. However, now miners appear to have come back online, with new and more efficient machines.\"\n\n2024 'halving'"

        "content": "The beginning of 2023 has provided Bitcoin (BTC) with bullish indicators and the rally to a year-to-date high at $21,647 has crypto traders hopeful that the worst part of the bear market has ended. The surge effect of BTC\u2019s bullish price action is also carrying over to Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin mining stocks.\n\nThe reduction in Bitcoin Fear and Greed index to neutral is possibly driven by volume increases, Bitcoin on-chain data and BTC price decoupling from equities markets. While not all analysts believe a market bottom is in, let\u2019s dive into the data.\n\nTrading volume and volatility return\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price spike has been accompanied by massive growth in trading volume. Over the last week, BTC volume has more than doubled, reaching $10.8 billion, a 114% increase over sevendays.\n\nBitcoin trading volume.

Source: Arcane Research\n\nCentralized exchanges (CEX) have been struggling with low trading volume, meaning lower fees for the business, inducing layoffs. The increase in volume for all exchanges is likely welcomed news.\n\nTrading volume increases coincide with profits returning\n\nBitcoin on-chain realized profits are retesting the adjusted spent output profit ratio (aSOPR) value of 1.0, which some analysts believe to be a key resistance level. The aSOPR metric historically shows a change in the overall market trajectory as profits are absorbed by trading volumes.\n\nBTC aSOPR 7-day exponential moving average.

As reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin\u2019s price action typically has been closely correlated to U.S. equities.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 30-day correlation to the Nasdaq reached 0.29 on Jan. 17, the highest BTC divergence from equities since December 2021.\n\nVetle Lunde a Senior Analyst at Arcane Research explains what decoupling means to the Bitcoin market.\n\n\u201cSoftening correlations is a positive development in the market.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s previous correlation could have been caused by institutional investors bundling BTC with other risk assets and large growth companies like Tesla holding exposure.\n\nNow that institutional investors and growth companies are holding less Bitcoin, correlation to markets may lessen in the future.\n\nEquities markets could continue to flutter due to the resiliency of high inflation, but Bitcoin\u2019s divergence from the stock market could help BTC become an investment hedge. According to some analysts, if Bitcoin can become a hedge to equities, institutional investors may return to the market.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) shows the potential of stretching its ongoing price recovery to $25,000 by March, based on a mix of bullish technical and macro indicators.\n\nBitcoin price exits descending channel range\n\nFirst, Bitcoin's potential to hit $25,000 comes from its exit from a prevailing descending channel range.\n\nA bull run or bull trap? \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 16, 2023\n\nNotably, BTC\u2019s price broke out of the range late last week, accompanying a rise in its trading volumes. The cryptocurrency\u2019s move upside also pushed the price above its resistance confluence, comprising a psychological price ceiling of $20,000 and its 20-week exponential moving average (20-week EMA; the green wave) near $19,500, as shown below.\n\nBTC/USD 1-week candle chart (Coinbase). Source: TradingView.com\n\nBreaking three resistance levels with strong volumes shows traders\u2019 conviction about an extended price rally. Should it happen, Bitcoin\u2019s next upside target appears at its 200-week EMA (the yellow wave) at around $25,000 \u2014 a 20% rise from current price levels.\n\nDollar forms a \u201cdeath cross\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s bullish technical outlook appears against the backdrop of a relatively weaker U.S. dollar, which is down due to expectations that the Federal Reserve will stop raising interest rates as a result of lowering inflation.\n\nThe two assets have mostly moved inversely to each another since March 2020. As of Jan. 16, the daily correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), a barometer to gauge the greenback\u2019s strength versus top rivaling currencies, was -0.83, according to TradingView.\n\nBTC/USD and DXY correlation coefficient.

For the dollar, the death cross shows its weakening momentum, meaning its short-term trend has been underperforming its long-term direction.\n\nDXY daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\n\u201cExpecting more downside in the mid to long term,\u201d independent market analyst Crypto Ed said about the dollar, adding:\n\n\u201cRisk on assets should bounce more on that. Or better said: I expect BTC to break its bearish cycle as the big run in DXY is finito.\u201d\n\nNot a long-term Bitcoin price rally\n\nBitcoin has risen 30% above $20,000 in 2023 so far, but on-chain data shows that the buying trend lacks support from institutional investors.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin gained 300% in year before last halving \u2014 Is 2023 different?\n\nFor instance, the total amount of Bitcoin held by digital assets holdings such as trusts, exchange-traded funds and other funds has been declining during the coin\u2019s price increase in recent months, according to CryptoQuant\u2019s Fund Holdings index.\n\nBitcoin fund holdings. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nIn addition, no unusual transactions occurred on-chain but on crypto exchanges, per the comparisons made between CryptoQuant\u2019s Token Transferred and Fund Flow Ratio metrics.\n\nBTC/USD versus Token Transferred (orange) and Fund Flow Ratio (blue). Source: CryptoQuant\n\nThe Token Transferred metric shows the number of coins transferred in a specific timeframe, while the Fund Flow Ratio represents the ratio of coin transfers involving the exchange to the overall coin transfers networkwide.\n\n\u201cUsually at the bottom, institutional investors want to buy quietly through OTC trading,\u201d noted market analyst MAC_D, adding:\n\n\u201cThis trading was simply actively traded only on the exchange, and no unusual transactions occurred on the on-chain. [...] The current institutional investors have remained calm and just watching. OTC trading will be brisk when they expect a full-fledged uptrend turn.\u201d\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Why is Bitcoin going up? Crypto prices rally after tough 2022 - AS USA",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency markets have started the year on the front foot after plunging during 2022. The price of Bitcoin, the most widely-used digital token, has risen by around 26% since the turn of the year and hit $21,000 for the first time since 7 November.\n\nThis rise could be a sign that confidence is returning to the market after a tumultuous year beset with interest rate hikes and cryptocurrency scandals.\n\nThe Federal Reserve implemented seven interest rate hikes during 2022 which sent stock prices and cryptocurrency assets into a tailspin. In December the central bank upped the borrowing rate to 4.50%, the highest level seen since 2007.\n\nBut after signs that inflation is slowing there is renewed hope that the Fed may be able to lower interest rates later this year. This would likely bring a solid stream of new investment into the industry and serve to push up prices across the board. However any hopes of a return to the 2021 peak, when Bitcoin was trading above $64,000, still seem a long way off.\n\nMarkets begin to bounce back after FTX aftershocks\n\nWhile central bank policy had an undeniable effect on markets last year, the cryptocurrency market was hit by a major scandal that shook investors\u2019 faith. The collapse of FTX, one of the largest digital exchanges, saw billions of dollars in value lost in a matter of days and investors blocked from withdrawing funds.\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been charged with multiple counts of fraud and criminal conspiracy as a result. The affair highlighted many of the concerns that investors typically have when it comes to the largely unregulated crypto markets and values plummeted.\n\nIn early November, as rumours about an impending collapse were circulating online, the price of Bitcoin slumped from around $21,000 to less than $16,000 in a matter of days. The January rise could be seen as little more than a bounce-back from the FTX scandal that rocked the industry.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci predicts positive year for Bitcoin\n\nIn recent days the rising price of Bitcoin \u2013 usually a barometer for crypto markets more generally \u2013 has sparked hope among investors that 2023 could see sustained gains made across the board. The market\u2019s total value has once again climbed above $1 trillion and some investors are considering a return to the tempestuous waters of cryptocurrency.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, briefly the White House communications director during the Trump administration and now chief executive of SkyBridge Capital, believes that 2023 can be a \u201crecovery year\u201d for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cYou are taking on risk but you\u2019re also believing in [bitcoin] adoption,\u201d he told CNBC during a crypto conference last week. \u201cSo if we get the adoption right, and I believe we will, [Bitcoin] could easily be a $50,000 to $100,000 asset over the next two to three years.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that FTX bought a 30% stake in SkyBridge Capital last September. Scaramucci claims that this deal was based on fraudulent information and that SkyBridge stands to buy back that stake once the bankruptcy court has issued a ruling on FTX\u2019s obligations. However the link between the companies does give reason for Scaramucci to hope that confidence returns to the markets."

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nColleges in the United States are increasingly offering courses on Bitcoin and crypto, with Texas A&M being the latest to join the trend. The College of Engineering and the Mays Business School will be offering a course called \"Bitcoin Protocol\" starting on January 17th, which will be taught by Korok Ray, an associate professor at the Mays Business School.Professor Ray announced in a series of tweets that after taking the \"Bitcoin Protocol\" course, students would be taught \"Programming Bitcoin,\" where they will learn how to develop their own Bitcoin library. He also mentioned that it took months of effort to get the courses approved by the school's curriculum committee.In addition to teaching about the technical aspects of blockchain technology and crypto, U.S. colleges are now also offering courses on the legal and regulatory issues related to these fields.An adjunct professor at Boston University's Law School, Thomas Hook, recently announced that the school now offers a course called \"Crypto Regulation\" for students who are interested in learning about how lawyers and companies in the crypto industry can navigate through regulatory challenges when bringing their products and services to market. According to Professor Hook, the course is designed to give future lawyers an understanding of the various legal and regulatory issues that companies in the crypto industry may face around the world.Several other universities have also begun offering courses on crypto, including Harvard, MIT, Oxford, National University of Singapore, Cornell, and University of California Berkeley.According to crypto researcher Josh Cowell, one of the major obstacles hindering widespread adoption of crypto is a lack of good educational resources. He believes that providing high-quality education about crypto can help improve people's financial literacy and overall understanding of this technology."

        "content": "DICKENS COUNTY, Texas \u2013 In May 2022, Argo Blockchain built a 160-acre bitcoin mining facility called \u201cHelios\u201d in Dickens County. After an endless struggle with falling bitcoin prices and higher energy costs, Argo would be $41 million in debt, but a $65 million purchase before the end of the year by Galaxy Digital would save its future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited to be a participant in this community,\u201d said Mike Wursthorn, vice president of Galaxy Digital. \u201cWe see it as a responsibility being one of the major employers now in Dickens County to help further build it up and ensure that there is a long term sustainable trajectory, not just for Helios, but Dickens county itself.\u201d\n\nAlso as a part of the acquisition, Galaxy agreed to provide Argo with a $35 million loan, secured by a collateral package with Argo mining equipment.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t just buy a Bitcoin mining facility and Helios, we joined the community,\u201d Wursthorn said.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that people can send and receive over the internet. Unlike the U.S. dollar, it\u2019s not centralized in a government bank. Transactions are verified through a complex network of computers around the world called the blockchain.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is a digital asset that allows people to transfer money without a middleman,\u201d said Amanda Fabiano, head of mining at Galaxy Digital. \u201cThere\u2019s no Bitcoin without Bitcoin mining, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re so invested in the mining space.\u201d\n\nThere are over 30 employees, all of which Galaxy kept from the original Argo team.\n\nGalaxy said it will succeed in ways that Argo couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cGalaxy is a diversified financial services company, so we don\u2019t just mine Bitcoin, we have multiple other units,\u201d Fabiano said. \u201cWith that, we think that we have a good chance of doing the right thing by the local community and building and growing and expanding.\u201d\n\nThe building near Afton, Texas hosts more than 50,000 servers submerged in a dielectric fluid that keeps them cool. Each of them competes with other computers across the globe to verify bitcoin transactions first.\n\nGalaxy plans to continue expanding the \u201cHelios\u201d facility that operates up to 180 megawatts of mining capacity.\n\n\u201cThe site itself is not at its full max capacity that it could potentially be out in the future, so there\u2019ll be more construction, more design work and more growth,\u201d Fabiano said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the future of money. It\u2019s the future of how we\u2019re going to use financial services and we\u2019re just at the very pioneering step of it, so the more that we can educate, I think the better everyone will be.\u201d\n\nWursthorn said Galaxy will continue where Argo left off on all community projects as well, including bringing back the city pool in Spur that\u2019s been closed since 2009. The company will also create local education programs to help others understand digital assets of the crypto economy.\n\nTo learn more, visit the Galaxy Digital website."

        "content": "The recent bitcoin price rally, combined with last year\u2019s lackluster returns for so-called safe investments, is drawing new attention to the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWhile the flagship cryptocurrency is still down more than 65% from its all-time high in November 2021, it has enjoyed a 26% spike over the past 30 days, including a 22% price increase over the past week.\n\n\u201cThis looks to be a real rebound,\u201d said Tyrone Ross, chief executive and co-founder of Turnqey Labs and principal at 401 Financial.\n\n\u201cVolume is strong and it\u2019s moving back to the 200-day moving averages,\u201d Ross said. \u201cIt also helps that inflation and dollar strength have abated a bit, but all of that can change swiftly. I think this will be a choppy year with some face-ripping rallies in-between, driven largely by the global macro environment.\u201d\n\nInvestment proxies for bitcoin are also getting caught up in the recent activity, which some analysts are saying represents a market that\u2019s already moving past the FTX debacle.\n\n\u201cThere has been some renewed interest in crypto ETFs after the bitcoin rally,\u201d said Roxanna Islam, associate director of research at VettaFi.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just true for crypto investments but also for broader blockchain investments that are growth- or tech-oriented,\u201d Islam said. \u201cThere is also some normalization of bitcoin prices after the initial shock of the FTX fallout. Most crypto ETFs are now back to prices seen before the FTX collapse.\u201d\n\nIslam cited as an example the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which is up 26.6% from where it was trading on Nov. 11 when FTX declared bankruptcy. \u201cWhile this fund saw over $18 million in outflows in the past month, there has already been almost $2.8 million in inflows during the past week,\u201d she said.\n\nCrypto mining stocks have also come charging back, as is illustrated by the 75% gain posted so far this year by the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI).\n\nA more concentrated look at crypto miners comes via Marathon Digital Holding (MARA), which is up 125% from the start of the year but is still saddled with a 73% decline over the past 12 months.\n\n\u201cCrypto mining stocks had a particularly rough few months compared to other crypto stocks because of rising energy costs,\u201d Islam said. \u201cRecently, some crypto mining stocks have seen some recovery as some companies take steps to restructure or avoid bankruptcy proceedings.\u201d\n\nRic Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, said it\u2019s too early to says that the bitcoin rally represents \u201cthe end of the crypto winter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat question remains very much open,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cIt could be a dead-cat bounce or it could be investors being too euphoric too quickly. But it does show that the crypto market is alive and well.\u201d\n\nLooking beyond the spike over the past few weeks or the incidents of fraud over the past several months, Edelman is locked into the idea of bitcoin charging toward record highs over the next two years.\n\n\u201cMuch of the malaise and fraud that took place in 2022 had nothing to do with the development of blockchain,\u201d he said. \u201cThose incidents do not undermine the legitimacy of the technology that crypto represents.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the price of bitcoin remained relatively stable throughout most of last year amid some high-profile cryptocurrency scandals should be viewed as positive, Edelman said. \u201cAs we enter 2023, people are beginning to refocus and remind themselves that the fundamental premise of blockchain technology remains as real as ever.\u201d\n\nEdelman is looking to 2024 and beyond, with history as a guide.\n\nAccording to the schedule that halves the bitcoin payment to miners every four years, that payment will be cut to 3 1/8 bitcoins next year.\n\n\u201cHistory tells us, every time the bitcoin mining reward is cut in half the price [eventually] doubles to maintain the value of the reward,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cIf you do the math and look based on historical levels of what happened in the 18 months following the [halving], the price of bitcoin reaches new highs of a 10 times increase over the prior price.\u201d\n\nThat math and that schedule put the price of Bitcoin at roughly $150,000 in the summer of 2025, or approximately 580% above the current price.\n\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s not an assurance,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cBut many people are confident that the upcoming [halving] will be reflected in a new era of prosperity for crypto.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin on-chain and technical data begin to suggest that the BTC price bottom is in - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price has followed a four-year cycle, with consecutive bull and bear trends occurring in somewhat measurable intervals. A closer look at Bitcoin\u2019s long-term price action reveals that the run-up to the top and bottom of the previous cycles look remarkably similar. What\u2019s more interesting is that the 2020\u20132021 cycle shows signs of following the same pattern.\n\nIndependent market analyst HornHarris found that the period between the bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom has been the same since 2015: 152 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively.\n\nEven in 2013, the bear market lasted 58 weeks, only a six-week difference from the other two cycles.\n\nBitcoin price chart with timelines of past cycles. Source: Twitter\n\nAnother resemblance with the last bottom formation is the similarity between Bitcoin\u2019s current uptrend and the one in 2019, when the primary catalyst was prevalent negative investor sentiment. Bitcoin price gained nearly 350% from the bottom of $3,125, and it didn\u2019t drop below this level moving forward, marking the previous cycle\u2019s bottom.\n\nFour years later, the conditions have changed, but the underlying reason for the latest 30% surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price was still the market expecting lower prices due to macroeconomic headwinds. The lack of positive sentiment and build-up of short positions in the futures market may have allowed buyers to stage a disbelief rally to hunt short-order liquidations and incite FOMO \u2014 fear of missing out \u2014 among investors who had been sitting on the sidelines.\n\nBut not all conditions are the same. Previously, BTC whales \u2014 addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC \u2014 went on a buying spree as Bitcoin\u2019s price started to bottom out. However, these buyers haven\u2019t participated in the recent rally, raising concerns about its sustainability.\n\nIf history repeats itself, Bitcoin\u2019s November 2022 lows of around $15,500 will mark the bottom of the current cycle. It would also mean that a new bullish cycle has begun, and the asset could record a new peak in October 2025.\n\nNumber of addresses with more than 1,000 BTC. Source: Glassnode\n\nIt will be interesting to see if whale buyers buy the Federal Reserve\u2019s theory under Jerome Powell that it\u2019s pulling off a successful soft landing instead of a recession as a result of its flight against inflation. December\u2019s economic data on consumer price inflation and employment numbers showed early signs of macro improvement. A few other on-chain indicators could help confirm whether this bull run is the real deal.\n\nShort-term bullish reversal signs appear\n\nBitcoin has been trading around bargain purchase levels for quite some time on the longer timeframes. In the short-term, however, the risk of price dropping to new lows was high due to miner selling pressure, macroeconomic headwind, and the fear of FTX contagion. The recent rally shows signs of on-chain signals moving into bullish territory.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s realized price metric reflects buyers\u2019 average price on moving the coins on-chain. Its price dropped below its realized price only three times in the last eight years. Moreover, a breakout above this level has marked the end of the bearish trend in each of them.\n\nCurrently, the realized price of Bitcoin sits at $19,715. If the price holds above this level, it will encourage buyers sitting on the sidelines to join the rally.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s on-chain Realized Price (yellow) and market price (black). Source: Glassnode\n\nAnother reliable short-term on-chain indicator is Spend Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). It measures the profitability of Bitcoin transactions based on the price of tokens when they are added and withdrawn from specific addresses.\n\nThe indicator is used to identify bullish and bearish trends. When the price is in an uptrend, investors add to their winning positions during pullbacks, indicated when the SOPR indicator\u2019s value stays above one. The inverse happens in a bear: Bears dominate the market by selling into rallies. Thus, a crossover of the metric above the pivot at one is a potent trend reversal signal.\n\nSo far, the seven-day average transactions are still occurring at a loss, but the price is very close to flipping bullish. Based on the last retest of SOPR\u2019s pivot, the bullish reversal will happen after a successful weekly close above $21,200.\n\nEntry adjusted SOPR. Source: Glassnode\n\nAnother notable development has occurred with Bitcoin miners, who were one of the most significant sellers in 2022 as the market price dropped below the production cost of Bitcoin, putting pressure on them. However, the days of miner capitulation are likely behind.\n\nThe Hash Ribbon indicator, developed by on-chain analyst Charles Edwards, flashed a buy signal, suggesting an end to the trend of dropping hash rates, with prices recovering above production costs of large- to medium-scale enterprises.\n\nUnless Bitcoin price drops below $20,000 in the near future, the market can expect miners to start accumulating Bitcoin instead of having to sell the entire amount to cover operation costs.\n\nThe stark similarities between Bitcoin\u2019s previous cycles and a relief from the ongoing miner sell-off should aid buyers in building a long-term bullish support level.\n\nHowever, the lack of whale buying and the price reversing from the SOPR pivot level around $21,200 raises a few alarms that the sellers may start to dominate again. The on-chain support level for buyers lies around the realized price at $19,715.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "New York faces a new legal fight over a proposed crypto-mining power plant - The Verge",
        "content": "Environmental groups are pushing New York state to scrutinize a crypto mining company\u2019s purchase of a gas-fired power plant, contending in a new lawsuit that turning the power plant into a crypto mine would go against the state\u2019s climate goals and dump more pollution on nearby neighborhoods.\n\nSierra Club and the Clean Air Coalition of Western New York filed a suit on Friday that challenges the New York Public Service Commission\u2019s (PSC) approval of the sale. Under state law, the commission has to give the green light before the transfer of ownership of a power plant can take place. Until now, the commission has mostly focused on whether such a sale would affect residents\u2019 electricity rates or create a monopoly. The commission needs to start taking climate change and environmental injustice into consideration because of a sweeping climate law passed in 2019, the new lawsuit argues.\n\n\u201cThe law says you can\u2019t just ignore these really serious consequences\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law says you can\u2019t just ignore these really serious consequences,\u201d says Dror Ladin, senior attorney at Earthjustice, the nonprofit environmental law group representing the plaintiffs. \u201cRunning the plant 24 hours a day to mine crypto is going to be very bad both for the climate and for and for people in the area.\u201d\n\nThe power plant, called Fortistar, is in the small city of North Tonawanda, located between Buffalo and Niagara Falls. Typically, Fortistar is used as a so-called \u201cpeaker plant,\u201d firing up infrequently to meet peak electricity demand during an energy crunch. The plant has only been in operation between 10 and 25 days a year since 2017, according to Environmental Protection Agency records cited in the complaint. That schedule is expected to change drastically if Canadian crypto mining company Digihost moves in, which is why some residents are worried about their potential new neighbor.\n\nDigihost petitioned the PSC to approve the purchase of Fortistar back in April 2021. It planned to run the plant \u201c24/7\u201d to power its crypto mining rigs, according to an environmental assessment form the company filed to North Tonawanda later that year. Crypto companies burn through enormous amounts of electricity to mine Bitcoin, more than many small countries use in a single year. To validate new transactions on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain and earn new tokens in return, \u201cminers\u201d have to solve difficult computational puzzles using specialized hardware. The more hardware you have and energy you use, the better your chances of earning new tokens.\n\nThat happens to produce a lot of pollution in the process \u2014 especially for operations that get all their electricity from a gas-fired plant like Fortistar. So some nearby residents worry that if Fortistar starts running 24/7, that would increase its environmental footprint.\n\n\u201cMy oldest son has asthma and I worry about how the pollution will affect him,\u201d one resident who lives about a quarter mile from the gas plant writes in an affidavit accompanying the environmental groups\u2019 complaint. \u201cI have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and I\u2019m also worried that increased pollution will worsen my condition.\u201d\n\nNew York also has its climate goals to consider. The state has committed to slashing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 85 percent by 2050. To achieve that goal, the climate law it passed in 2019 mandates that state agencies consider whether its decisions would endanger those goals or disproportionately burden \u201cdisadvantaged communities.\u201d While the state is still finalizing criteria for what makes a community \u201cdisadvantaged,\u201d some census tracts near Fortistar have already been found to cope with more pollution than 90 percent of the state.\n\nNevertheless, New York\u2019s Public Service Commission approved Digihost\u2019s petition to purchase the plant in September 2022. \u201cWhile numerous commenters raise significant environmental concerns ... these matters are beyond the scope of the limited review undertaken in this proceeding,\u201d the PSC wrote in its decision.\n\nThe suit filed Friday is the first to push the PSC to broaden the scope of its decision-making, citing New York\u2019s climate law. If the environmental groups are successful, the commission would have to rethink its approval of Digihost\u2019s planned takeover of the plant. At that point, Digihost could have a tough time convincing the state that its new crypto mine wouldn\u2019t imperil climate goals.\n\nIn a similar fight over a crypto-mining power plant in New York called Greenidge, the state\u2019s Department of Conservation denied air permits because its operations \u201cwould be inconsistent with the statewide greenhouse gas emission limits established in the Climate Act.\u201d In November, Governor Kathy Hochul signed a two-year moratorium on new permits for fossil fuel power plants seeking to mine Bitcoin. That gives the state time to conduct an environmental impact review of crypto mining more broadly.\n\nBoth Greenidge and Fortisar are excluded from that moratorium because they had applied for air permits before the law was passed. Greenidge is still up and running as it appeals the state\u2019s decision on its air permit. But environmental advocates are optimistic they might be able to keep a crypto mine at Fortistar from getting off the ground at all."

        "title": "Merkle Tree in Blockchain: What is it and How does it work - Simplilearn",
        "content": "A hash tree, also known as a Merkle tree, is a tree in which each leaf node is labeled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and each non-leaf node is labeled with the cryptographic hash of its child nodes' labels. The majority of hash tree implementations are binary (each node has two child nodes), but they can also have many more child nodes.\n\nBut what actually is the Merkle tree in Blockchain, and how it is used in Blockchain? So, if you want to know the answer to all these questions, then you are in the right place.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhat Is a Merkle Tree?\n\nMerkle trees, also known as Binary hash trees, are a prevalent sort of data structure in computer science.\n\nIn bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, they're used to encrypt blockchain data more efficiently and securely.\n\nIt's a mathematical data structure made up of hashes of various data blocks that summarize all the transactions in a block.\n\nIt also enables quick and secure content verification across big datasets and verifies the consistency and content of the data.\n\nWhat Is a Merkle Root?\n\nA Merkle root is a simple mathematical method for confirming the facts on a Merkle tree.\n\nThey're used in cryptocurrency to ensure that data blocks sent through a peer-to-peer network are whole, undamaged, and unaltered.\n\nThey play a very crucial role in the computation required to keep cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether running.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nCryptographic Hash Functions\n\nA hash function maps any type of arbitrary data of any length to a fixed-size output. It is commonly used in cryptography since it is a cryptographic function.\n\nThey are efficient and are well-known for one property: they are irreversible. It's a one-way function that's only meant to work in one direction.\n\nSome of the Hash families available are Message Direct (MD), Secure Hash Function (SHF), and RIPE Message Direct (RIPEMD).\n\nNow, take an example, if you use the SHA256 hash algorithm and pass 101Blockchains as input, you will get the following output\n\nfbffd63a60374a31aa9811cbc80b577e23925a5874e86a17f712bab874f33ac9\n\nIn conclusion, these are the following key properties of the hash function:\n\nDeterministic\n\nPre-Image Resistant\n\nComputationally Efficient\n\nCannot be Reversed Engineered\n\nCollision Resistant\n\nWorking of Merkle Trees\n\nA Merkle tree totals all transactions in a block and generates a digital fingerprint of the entire set of operations, allowing the user to verify whether it includes a transaction in the block.\n\nMerkle trees are made by hashing pairs of nodes repeatedly until only one hash remains; this hash is known as the Merkle Root or the Root Hash.\n\nThey're built from the bottom, using Transaction IDs, which are hashes of individual transactions.\n\nEach non-leaf node is a hash of its previous hash, and every leaf node is a hash of transactional data.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nNow, look at a little example of a Merkle Tree in Blockchain to help you understand the concept.\n\nConsider the following scenario: A, B, C, and D are four transactions, all executed on the same block. Each transaction is then hashed, leaving you with:\n\nHash A\n\nHash B\n\nHash C\n\nHash D\n\nThe hashes are paired together, resulting in:\n\nHash AB\n\nand\n\nHash CD\n\nAnd therefore, your Merkle Root is formed by combining these two hashes: Hash ABCD.\n\nIn reality, a Merkle Tree is much more complicated (especially when each transaction ID is 64 characters long). Still, this example helps you have a good overview of how the algorithms work and why they are so effective.\n\nBenefits of Merkle Tree in Blockchain\n\nMerkle trees provide four significant advantages -\n\nValidate the data's integrity: It can be used to validate the data's integrity effectively.\n\nTakes little disk space: Compared to other data structures, the Merkle tree takes up very little disk space.\n\nTiny information across networks: Merkle trees can be broken down into small pieces of data for verification.\n\nEfficient Verification: The data format is efficient, and verifying the data's integrity takes only a few moments.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhy Is It Essential to Blockchain?\n\nThink of a blockchain without Merkle Trees to get a sense of how vital they are for blockchain technology. Let\u2019s have one of Bitcoin because its use of Merkle Trees is essential for the cryptocurrency and easier to grasp.\n\nIf Bitcoin didn't include Merkle Trees, per se, every node on the network would have to retain a complete copy of every single Bitcoin transaction ever made. One can imagine how much information that would be.\n\nAny authentication request on Bitcoin would require an enormous amount of data to be transferred over the network: therefore, you'll need to validate the data on your own.\n\nTo confirm that there were no modifications, a computer used for validation would need a lot of computing power to compare ledgers.\n\nMerkle Trees are a solution to this issue. They hash records in accounting, thereby separating the proof of data from the data itself.\n\nProving that giving tiny amounts of information across the network is all that is required for a transaction to be valid.\n\nFurthermore, it enables you to demonstrate that both ledger variations are identical in terms of nominal computer power and network bandwidth.\n\nUse-Cases of Merkle Tree in Blockchain\n\nThere are more Merkle tree implementations out there.\n\nGit, a distributed version control system, is one of the most widely used. It is used to handle projects by programmers from all around the world.\n\nInterplanetary File System, a peer-to-peer distributed protocol, is another suitable implementation. It's also open-source, allowing computers to join and use a centralized file system.\n\nIt's part of the technique that generates verifiable certificate transparency logs.\n\nAmazon DynamoDB and Apache Cassandra use it during the data replication process. These No-SQL distributed databases use Merkle trees to control discrepancies.\n\nDecipher the global craze surrounding Blockchain with the Blockchain Certification Training Course. Get trained today.\n\nConclusion\n\nMerkle Tree is an essential fundamental of Blockchain technology, enabling its growth in the IT World. Simplilearn's Blockchain Certification Training was designed for developers who want to decipher the global craze surrounding Blockchain, Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and many other technologies like Merkle Tree. You'll learn the core structure and technical mechanisms of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger, Dogecoin, and Multichain Blockchain platforms and their underlying technologies.\n\nHope you liked the tutorial on Merkle Tree in Blockchain, in case of any doubts, please ask your questions in the comment section below."

XRP saw more modest gains than most other major cryptos as the court case between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs Inc., which uses XRP in its payment network, clouds the token\u2019s prospects.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the 24 hours fell 0.13% to US$979.6 billion, while trading volume slid 43.1% to US$47.1 billion.\n\nU.S. equities rose on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3%, the S&P 500 Index gained 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite Index finished the day 0.7% higher. U.S. markets are closed today for the Martin Luther King public holiday\n\nDecember\u2019s U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) released last week showed that inflation rose 6.5% year-on-year, in line with expectations and lower than the 7.1% recorded in November. The drop was the biggest monthly decline since April 2020.\n\nLast month, the Fed raised interest rates by 50-basis points to between 4.25% and 4.5%, the highest in 15 years. It had raised rates by 75 basis-points for the prior four consecutive meetings to curb inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has warned of more rate increases in 2023.\n\nThe next Fed meeting will be held from Jan. 31 to Feb. 1, with anlysts at the CME Group predicting a 94.2% chance of an increase of 25 basis points given the most recent CPI data.\n\nSee related article:Alameda liquidators get liquidated while consolidating funds on DeFi lending platform Aave"

Give it some time. Big picture, yes, really bullish Bitcoin,\u201d McGlone added.\n\nGraph showing Bitcoin market prices. Image: Mike McGlone\n\nMcGlone also warned BTC might not see the surge being predicted just yet, as there are challenging macroeconomic conditions and pressure from interest-rate hikes.\n\nHe believes the Nasdaq is likely to dip below its 200-week moving average, which he claims is another indication BTC\u2019s price rally may not happen soon.\n\n\u201cLiquidity is being pulled away still and if the Nasdaq breaks down, everything breaks down, Bitcoin is going to be part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still think it\u2019s going to come out ahead so to me that\u2019s where we stand,\u201d he added.\n\nRelated: Arthur Hayes: Bitcoin bottomed as \u2018everyone who could go bankrupt has gone bankrupt\u2019\n\nMcGlone also said the market has entered an \u201cunprecedented\u201d environment, \u201cwhere we\u2019re having bounces in what we know are bear markets and the Fed just says, sorry we\u2019re taking the punchbowl away, we're not giving it get back to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still think we\u2019re in the midst of the biggest macroeconomic reset of our lifetimes, we just had a 100-year event in terms of the pandemic, we\u2019re having a historic war in Europe and we\u2019re having a historic shift in political leadership in China,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI mean it\u2019s going back to the days of the Soviet Union when you have one leader and are expecting to be economically viable.\u201d"

The surge in mining stocks also relieved the troubled miners who had to sell a significant chunk of their mined coins to boost liquidity in 2022.\n\nBitfarms \u2014 one of the top BTC mining firms \u2014 registered a 140% surge in the first two weeks of January 2023, followed by Marathon Digital Holdings with a 120% surge. Hive Blockchain Technologies saw its stock value nearly double in the same period, while the MVIS Global Digital Assets Mining Index is up by 64% in the first month of the new year.\n\nThe Luxor Hashprice Index, which aims to quantify how much a miner might make from the processing power used by the Bitcoin network, has increased by 21% this year. This partly reflects larger rewards due to an increase in the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe bull run in 2021 prompted several mining companies to go public while others invested heavily in equipment and expansion. However, a prolonged crypto winter in 2022 exposed the vulnerabilities and lack of proper structuring in many of these mining firms.\n\nRelated: Samsung investment arm to launch Bitcoin Futures ETF amid rising crypto interest\n\nThe 2021 bull market saw a significant increase in borrowing by the Bitcoin mining industry, which had a negative effect on their financial standing during the ensuing bear market.

By the end of 2022, leading BTC miners such as Core Scientific filed for bankruptcy.\n\nLiabilities of public Bitcoin mining companies.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, have always been pitted against each other. With the start of the new year, the first debate has surfaced comparing BTC\u2019s capped supply of 21 million to ETH\u2019s deflationary supply, with disagreement over which of the two qualifies as sound money.\n\nAn Ethereum-focused Twitter user called \u2018ultra sound money\u2019 compared the supply issuance of both cryptocurrencies and suggested that \u201cif capped-supply BTC is sound then decreasing-supply ETH is ultrasound.\u201d\n\nif capped-supply BTC is sound\n\n\n\ndecreasing-supply ETH is ultra sound pic.twitter.com/L2tsFzPQ7q \u2014 ultra sound money (@ultrasoundmoney) January 15, 2023\n\nThe comparison between the two didn\u2019t sit well with BTC proponents, who quickly pointed out that soundness comes from the credibility of the monetary policy and not an ever-changing one. Dan Held, a famous Bitcoin proponent, pointed out the flaw in the argument and noted that a constantly changing one has less credibility. He said:\n\n\u201cTime builds trust with humans, it\u2019s not all about code. According to your logic, if we spun up another crypto with more deflation, that would be \u201csounder.\u201d\n\nAnother Bitcoin proponent questioned the credibility of Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy, reminding that the same monetary policy has \u201cchanged a least 11 times in its seven years of existence.\u201d On the other hand, Bitcoin has not changed its monetary policy once.\n\nEther's historical projected issuance rate. Source: ethhub.io\n\nEther became deflationary in August 2021 with the introduction of Ethereum improvement proposal-1559 (EIP-1559). The upgrade introduced a burn mechanism that automatically burns a portion of the transaction fee, decreasing the overall circulating supply of ETH.\n\nIn response to Alex Gladstein\u2019s argument that \u201cadmins\u201d can arbitrarily change Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy, independent Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano claimed that every change on the Ethereum network had been approved by the thousands of node operators run by community members.\n\nThe term \"admins\" implies that there is a small group with superuser powers that can change things on Ethereum which is completely false and has been proven false many times.\n\n\n\nYou can believe what you want about the sound money vs ultra sound money debate. \u2014 sassal.eth (@sassal0x) January 16, 2023\n\nLeo Glisic, the founder of the Maitri network, said that ETH had become sound money now, but BTC won\u2019t hit its cap until the year 2140.\n\nBitcoin has faced similar monetary changes and tweaking of the original code in the past. The most notable one came during 2017 when there was a growing demand for increasing the Bitcoin block size to accommodate more transactions per block and make it more scalable.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin steps out of 'fear' for the first time in nine months\n\nThe majority of the Bitcoin community remained against making any changes to the original code of Satoshi Nakamoto. As a result, the Bitcoin network experienced a hard fork in 2017, leading to the formation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a cryptocurrency with a block size of 8 MB against BTC\u2019s 1 MB. However, today, BCH has had very little on-chain development and is currently trading at a 97% price drop from its all-time high."

        "content": "The World Economic Forum's (WEF) Great Reset agenda will be under threat - and could \u201cspectacularly fail\u201d, if cryptocurrency markets are not reigned in through government regulatory frameworks, warned Nigel Green, of the deVere Group.\n\nThe WEF's 2023 annual meetup at Davos (which starts today in Switzerland) will not succeed unless it advances cryptocurrency regulation, said Green, who is the CEO and founder of one of the world\u2019s largest financial advisory, asset management, and fintech organisations.\n\nThe WEF is returning to its traditional timeslot and conference location of Davos for the four-day event, following two years of disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDavos is US delegate-dominated\n\nAccording to market reports, the in-person conference, which will see global leaders and heads of industry meet at the Swiss mountain resort, also coincides with Bitcoin, the world\u2019s biggest crypto by market capitalisation, recording a staggering 28% jump in value since the beginning of January.\n\nRecords show that 2,658 attendees are registered for the event, and they include heads of state, business royalty, actual royalty, media honchos, and academics from more than 100 countries.\n\nRepresentatives from the US form the largest portion of the delegates with 27%, while two-thirds of the attendees are from 10 of the \u2018more than 100\u2019 included nations.\n\nUS crypto regulation to play a major role in Great Reset strategy\n\nThis means that regulations applied in the US will likely have the greatest impact on the success of the Great Reset strategy which aims to homogenise the global financial markets as part of its wider plans to create a one-world order, as set out by the WEF\u2019s public Great Reset statement.\n\nOutlining its plans for a global, one-world order, it says: \u201cThe inconsistencies, inadequacies, and contradictions of multiple systems - from health and finance to energy and education, are more exposed than ever before amidst a global context of concern for lives, livelihoods, and the planet\n\n\u201c... As we enter a unique window of opportunity to shape the recovery, this initiative will offer insights to help inform all those determining the future of state global relations, the direction of national economies the priorities of societies, the nature of business models, and the management of global commons.\u201d\n\nMore action, less talk on crypto regulation, says deVere CEO\n\nSpeaking about the opportunities Davos presents, Green said governments must take action, rather than continue to discuss the possibility of regulation in the crypto sphere. \u201cThe leaders assembled in Davos at the WEF must next week return home to their governments who then need to insist that their financial regulators must stop \u2018talking the talk\u2019 and begin to up the ante on regulating the cryptocurrency market.\n\n\u201cThe time for endless platitudes on greater regulatory scrutiny is over. Action is required.\n\n\u201cShould those in attendance at the WEF not advance the agenda of crypto regulation as a result of the 2023 summit, they will have spectacularly failed.\u201d\n\nGreen also cited three reasons why crypto needs further regulations, saying institutional adoption of crypto can only be successful if there is greater trust in the space, and it is less volatile. He also called for crypto be, \u201cbrought into the regulatory tent and held to the same standards as the rest of the system.\u201d\n\nThe second reason Green gave related to incidents of fraud. \u201cAfter a year of significant crypto firm collapses, accusations of top-level fraud, and prison sentences for insider trading, there\u2019s no denying that greater scrutiny would help protect investors.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, he mentioned that regulation would provide a; \u201cpotential long-term, a sustainable economic boost to those countries which introduce it as crypto is widely regarded as the future of finance.\u201d\n\nWhat is needed now, says Nigel Green, is a workable internationally agreed and recognised regulatory framework that \u201cis sensible and doesn\u2019t hamper innovation or compromise the inherent nature of the digital assets and market.\u201d\n\nHe concluded: \u201cCryptocurrencies are here to stay and the market is only set to grow exponentially.\n\n"

With the hardfork, titled V0.3.1, the proof-of-stake network aims to reduce the severity of spikes in transaction prices and address chain reorganizations.\n\nSolana rose 2.3% to change hands at US$23.31, a surge of 41.9% over the past week. Solana is the best performer on the list for 2023 so far, bouncing back after a severe sell-off in the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and affiliated companies that had large holdings of the token.\n\nDogecoin fell 2.7% to US$0.08 for the largest losses in the list, but was still trading up 9.2% for the past week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the 24 hours dipped 1% to US$991 billion, while trading volume rose 15.8% to US$54.1 billion.\n\n\u201cWe see the main driver behind this 20% BTC hike over the past week the fact that some macro fears are subsiding with positive economic data in the US, including lower inflation stats and strong job growth numbers,\u201d Bradley Duke, co-chief executive at crypto investment firm, ETC Group, told Forkast in emailed statement.\n\n\u201cIn Europe, the E.U. released unemployment stats which were the lowest in 23 years,\u201d he added, \u201cand China lifted many of the border restrictions. This shift in sentiment was reflected in the BTC futures market, with traders betting long four days in a row based on the Long-Short ratio.\u201d\n\nU.S. markets were closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King public holiday.

        "title": "Cryptocurrency mining, which relies on abundant power, expanding in Iowa - The Gazette",
        "content": "Black Hawk, Marshall and Grundy counties have server farms. Hardin County is considering two others\n\nCryptocurrency mining \u2014 which relies on cheap, abundant energy to power banks of computers \u2014 is expanding in Iowa, with Hardin County considering two new sites.\n\nMiningStore, which in 2019 opened its flagship mining site in Grundy County, is asking Hardin County, in north central Iowa, to rezone two parcels from agricultural to manufacturing to allow for installation of mining sites next to electrical substations owned by Midland Power Cooperative.\n\n\u201cThis is kind of a new thing, not like a restaurant or a commercial facility,\u201d said Hardin County Supervisor BJ Hoffman.\n\nThe Grundy County site has a large Quonset hut humming with fans that cool more than 1,000 computers that work round the clock to solve math problems that create bitcoin, the world\u2019s most well-known cryptocurrency. As each new block of bitcoin is solved, mining operations like this get a payout.\n\nThe Hardin County sites, if approved, would be smaller with vented crates that contain servers.\n\nMiningStore founder and Chief Executive Officer JP Baric, 25, of North Carolina, spoke earlier this month to the Hardin County Board of Supervisors. The county\u2019s Planning & Zoning Commission will consider his proposal Jan. 24 and then make a recommendation to the supervisors.\n\nCryptocurrency mining has raised concerns in Iowa and elsewhere because of how much electricity it uses. The White House reported in August the global electricity use for crypto mining was between 120 billion and 240 billion kilowatt-hours per year, which is more than the total annual electricity use of some countries including Argentina and Australia. This surge in demand is happening as the world is trying to reduce electricity consumption because of climate change.\n\nEach of the proposed Hardin County sites would use 5 megawatts, the equivalent to powering 4,000 to 9,000 homes, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nBut supporters of crypto mining say they are adding resilience to the power grid by using surplus wind and solar energy that\u2019s often wasted if utilities don\u2019t have battery storage. At times of peak energy needs, the mining sites would halt operations, giving the utility more capacity for other customers.\n\n\u201cThey sign an agreement with Midland Power Cooperative to shutter their operation to a minimum during peak times, whether it\u2019s July in Iowa when everyone is using AC or in the middle of December when power consumption is high as well,\u201d Hoffman said.\n\nCedar Falls Utilities signed leases in 2021 with two companies, Simple Mining and Energy Conversation Group, to place crypto mining crates at its utility site, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported in June.\n\nThe utility is trying out the arrangement because the mining developers pay for infrastructure and help with demand response, the city-owned utility said in a PowerPoint presentation that Baric shared with The Gazette.\n\nBut these local utilities still rely a great deal on coal and natural gas.\n\nMidland Power Cooperative, which provides electrical services to 17 Iowa counties, gets at least 46 percent of its power from coal, according to its website. In 2021, Cedar Falls Utilities was getting about 60 percent of its energy from non-renewable sources, including coal and natural gas.\n\nThe MiningStore also has opened a crypto mining site in Marshall County, near St. Anthony, Hoffman said.\n\nThe Black Hawk County Board of Supervisors in August decided against rezoning to allow a crypto farm, citing noise and energy use. Grundy County also voted down a second location proposed by MiningStore.\n\nComments: (319) 339-3157; erin.jordan@thegazette.com\n\nContainers holding bitcoin mining machines run next to a power substation April 19, 2022, at the MiningStore's bitcoin mining facility in Grundy Center. The company has asked Hardin County to rezone two parcels from agricultural to manufacturing to allow for two more small crypto mining sites with crates like ones shown here.

        "title": "With Confident Ignorance Of Bitcoin, So-Called 'Experts' Sacrifice Their Credibility - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Recent examples of so-called \u201cexperts\u201d speaking confidently, yet incorrectly, about Bitcoin will come back to haunt them.\n\nThis is an opinion editorial by Mickey Koss, a West Point graduate with a degree in economics. He spent four years in the infantry before transitioning to the Finance Corps.\n\nBarely a week into 2023, and I\u2019ve seen Anthony \u201cPomp\u201d Pompliano debate Michael Shellenberger and Joe Rogan interview Peter Zeihan. While these media impressions may seem unrelated, a common thread is sewn between the two: experts in different fields confidently professing uninformed opinions on Bitcoin.\n\nZeihan\u2019s misunderstandings can be heard in the last 20 minutes or so of the interview. In fact, our friend Guy Swann just made a nearly 90-minute long episode of \u201cBitcoin Audible\u201d dedicated to tearing Zeihan\u2019s analysis apart. Caf\u00e9 Bitcoin did the same recently in the first half or so of its January 9, 2023 episode.\n\nShellenberger made it a little easier to locate his misunderstandings, apparently going on Pomp\u2019s podcast for the sole purpose of demonstrating his complete and utter ignorance.\n\nI think one of the most pertinent questions to consider following these conversations is: How are either of these two gentlemen qualified to make such assessments in the first place?\n\nHow could someone feel so comfortable saying something they so obviously know so little about? If these two are so confident with opinions that are so obviously wrong and uninformed, why should I trust them on anything else?\n\nWhile discussing these two interviews in a small group, one of the members said something that inspired the idea behind this article:\n\n\u201cFor now they both feel secure in their assertions. In the next bull cycle these clips will haunt them and tarnish their credibility.\u201d \u2013Alex Brammer, board of directors member for the Bitcoin Today Coalition (BTC)\n\nHe even turned that sentiment into a tweet, seen below:\n\nA characteristic common to Bitcoiners is their low time preference \u2014 the willingness to sacrifice short-term comfort for long-term gains, as opposed to following every whim.\n\nThese individuals are the personification of what the fiat system is doing to people, a symptom of what happens when the money ceases to communicate clear pricing signals. Their time preference has been so skewed that they are willingly sacrificing their long-term credibility for short-term notoriety. They do it thoughtlessly, with little understanding of what they\u2019re even critiquing, let alone the long-term implications of what they\u2019re saying. They do it because they must, lest they be cast out as simpletons, like the rest of us.\n\nWhat ever happened to simply saying \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d? Perhaps more importantly, what happens when all these naysayers are not just proven wrong, but completely, spectacularly and absolutely wrong in every way?\n\nI predict in the months and years to come, that those who chose to speak carelessly will begin to quickly lose any semblance of the credibility that they once had.\n\nThe Cure For Gell-Mann Amnesia Is Absurdity\n\n\u201cBriefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray\u2019s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward \u2014 reversing cause and effect. I call these the \u2018wet streets cause rain\u2019 stories. Paper\u2019s full of them. \"In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.\u201d \u2013Michael Crichton\n\nBitcoin is the orange pill that wakes you up from the matrix, yes, but what if the narrative became too absurd? What if the critiques and the gripes became so obviously wrong that these so-called experts were no longer respected, let alone listened to?\n\nI was a fan of Zeihan. I found his books interesting and informative. They appeared well thought out and thoroughly researched. But after that interview, I don\u2019t know what to think anymore. After hearing him speak, before even hearing his Bitcoin critique, all I really heard was a quasi-automaton; a character who was well rehearsed at speaking in polished sound bites. His Bitcoin analysis was so smooth, well worded and confident. Man, was he confident. And everything he said was absolutely wrong.\n\nI see the next few years as the precipice for the dissolution of current day experts. Much like the economist uncle in the dystopian tale \u201cThe Mandibles,\u201d these experts will have answers for everything, and yet won\u2019t be able to explain a thing. Slowly but surely, people will realize that the world that these \u201cexperts\u201d have created inside their theoretical minds no longer exists. Reality will eventually come crashing down.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to wait for that.\n\nOnce you understand Bitcoin, you understand that the long-term price is slowly approaching infinity as central banks gradually, then suddenly, add monetary units to the system in order to manipulate the cost of capital as they see fit.\n\nSaving in bitcoin may be a bumpy road for those who do not yet see the value, but in my eyes, it\u2019s the safest thing that I own. As I sit to reflect during this tumultuous week in the bear market, I feel that I have never been more bullish than I am right now.\n\nThis is a guest post by Mickey Koss.

        "title": "Bitcoin moves toward neutral sentiment on Fear & Greed index - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "For the first time since April 2022, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index (FGI) has moved out of the \u2018fear\u2019 zone and into \u2018neutral.\u2019\n\nOver the weekend, Bitcoin reached a score of 52 on the index as Bitcoin pushed over $21,000.\n\nAs of press time, the score has retraced slightly to the bottom end of the \u2018fear\u2019 scale at a rating of 45. The index started the year in the \u2018extreme fear\u2019 zone, indicating that bearish sentiment had control of the market at the start of January.\n\nHowever, as Bitcoin rallied from the $15,600 to $17,200 range held throughout November and December, the FGI moved away from extreme fear.\n\nBitcoin went into free fall following the collapse of FTX. However, it appears to have recovered to pre-FTX-collapse levels within the past week. The top cryptocurrency by market cap was range bound for roughly 63 days before breaking resistance to break back above $20,000.\n\nFurthermore, while the FGI may have moved away from \u2018fear,\u2019 other global metrics have not shown a similar bullish trend. For example, Google search traffic for the term \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 is still at its lowest since December 2020.\n\nInterest by region shows El Salvador as the most interested in Bitcoin by some margin, with Nigeria following behind before a large gap before European countries such as Netherlands, Switzerland, and Austria.\n\nBitcoin is legal tender in El Salvador, while Nigeria utilizes BTC for peer-to-peer payments.\n\nNigeria recently recognized crypto as an asset class alongside its CBDC, the e-Naira. However, Paxful CEO Ray Youssef attributed the rise in Bitcoin\u2019s popularity to Nigeria\u2019s youth culture by stating:\n\n\u201cNigeria is different, the youth were all about it, they were like bring in the Bitcoin, screw everything else let\u2019s do this.\u201d\n\nAside from these outlier nations, interest in Bitcoin has undoubtedly waned during the bear market, and the recent rally has not led to a considerable increase in Bitcoin searches globally.\n\nAdditionally, a review of sentiment analysis for popular videos, news, and blogs related to Bitcoin showed a peak in positive sentiment on Jan. 15. However, there has been no apparent increase in either positive or negative views over the past 30 days.\n\nLooking at the historical FGI data, it is clear that Bitcoin has broken the downward trendline which started in November 2021. However, other breakouts were supported by increased interest in Bitcoin, which is not evident as of press time.\n\nPotential negative catalysts remain at the forefront of investors\u2019 minds as Digital Currency Group has failed to publicly sure up its business. As a result, the risk of further pain in the market remains high, with many pointing to the recent price action as indicative of a bull trap.\n\nHowever, Alistair Milne, chief investment officer at Altana Digital Currency, shared a popular graph that depicts the typical investor mentality at each stage of a price cycle. In the image shown below, the final stage of a bear market is described as \u2018disbelief.\u2019\n\nFollowing the \u2018disbelief\u2019 phase, the market moves back into the bull territory.\n\nSuch images are far from 100% accurate as there is no crystal ball to predict Bitcoin\u2019s price. However, with falling inflation and little over one year until the next Bitcoin halving, there is finally some reason to hold out hope of a faster-than-expected return to the bull cycle."

        "content": "Bitcoin price records a massive rally last week due to a technical breakout, as reported earlier by CoinGape. The BTC price trend was able to build momentum and surpassed the psychological level of $20K.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the BTC price has been trading sideways after hitting a high of $21,345. However, on-chain data and analysts suggest more upside for Bitcoin. Can the BTC price rise above $65K by mid-2023?\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Turns Bullish\n\nBitcoin price is trading strongly above the psychological level of $20K. However, the BTC price may witness some pullback due to the possibility of profit booking by investors.\n\nIn the daily timeframe, a breakout of the Bollinger Bands Squeeze in the last few days caused a massive rally in the Bitcoin price. As the bands are still diverging amid a rise in volatility, the BTC price will continue to move higher. However, RSI indicates a high possibility of a pullback as it hit almost 90 in the overbought zone.\n\nMoreover, a crossover of 20-EMA over 50-EMA shows a continuation of the bullish trend. Finally, bulls have taken over bears and brought a recovery across the crypto market.\n\nCrypto analysts Michael van de Poppe and Credible Crypto remain bullish on Bitcoin price. Michael van de Poppe believes the BTC price will pullback below $21K amid the bounce in the U.S. dollar index (DXY), which is currently over 102.50.\n\n\u201cIf you thought the run to 60k we had was aggressive wait till you see this 5th wave,\u201d said Credible Crypto.\n\nMeanwhile, veteran trader Peter Brandt shared two charts, a weekly and a monthly, predicting a Bitcoin price rally to $65K in mid-2023. As per Brandt, the BTC price will hit $25K and witness a correction to $18K. Thereafter, a rally to at least $65K can be witnessed. However, he also believes that it\u2019s difficult to predict prices in the current market conditions.\n\nOn-Chain Analysis of Bitcoin\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, Bitcoin price is following its historical pattern despite experts remaining uncertain whether historical chart patterns apply to the current cycle.\n\nBitcoin traded below the 200-daily moving average (DMA) for 386 days in the 2018-19 bear market. Considering the last week\u2019s rally, the BTC price is back above 200-DMA after 381 days.\n\nThus, there is a high possibility that Bitcoin has bottomed out and the next cycle has started. However, investors need to consider other factors before deciding to invest in the current market conditions.\n\nAlso Read: Shibarium Beta Is About To Be Launched, Confirms Shiba Inu Team"

They are also used for investment in an entity (a \u201csecurity token,\u201d which entitles the holder to ownership of a portion of an entity), or for products or services (a \u201cutility token,\u201d which entitles the holder to a product once it has been produced, for example).\n\nStablecoins, which are supposed to be associated with lower volatility, are unique in that they are backed by a currency (e.g. the U.S. dollar), a commodity (e.g. gold) or a financial instrument (e.g. a stock or a bond). This is to keep the value of the digital currency stable.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s plunge is followed in the headlines on a daily basis. While this is not the first time it has fallen, it is particularly noteworthy as it is the biggest drop in value since late 2020. The collapse is partly due to rising interest rates and the flight of investors from these risky investments. Although it is recovering, Bitcoin is still a long way from the heights it once reached.\n\nThis media coverage raises many questions about the sustainability of these cryptoassets. Indeed, the latter are marked by extreme volatility in their unregulated markets in addition to being associated with speculation by many players in the financial world.\n\nIndeed, the BBC recently reported that cryptocurrency laundering rose 30 per cent in 2021. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which aims to protect U.S. consumers, reported that in 2021, fraud schemes cost investors more than $1 billion in cryptocurrencies. Needless to say, very few of the defrauded investors have recovered their money.\n\nOne billion users by 2022\n\nYet we are seeing a slow but sure increase in the adoption of cryptocurrencies by companies. In an ongoing study of the impact of cryptocurrency adoption by public companies on their social responsibility, I noted that many of them, such as Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s, have started to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. This is particularly the case in their branches in El Salvador, following that country\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nOthers, such as Japanese online retail giant Rakuten, have chosen to accept cryptocurrencies even if their country is not pushing to adopt Bitcoin as a currency. They say they are driven by a desire to offer more payment options to their customers.\n\nThe user base for cryptocurrencies is growing year on year. For example, Crypto.com, an exchange platform, estimated that about 295 million people had entered the cryptocurrency market as of December 2021. The platform expected the number of users to cross the one billion mark by December 2022.\n\nCryptocurrencies also allow people with unreliable or insecure banking systems to access a parallel banking system that is independent of the traditional banking system. Offering a less affluent part of the population access to a different form of banking system is one of the reasons the President of El Salvador gave for making Bitcoin legal tender in the country.\n\nA healthy fluctuation\n\nThe growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), as well as the development of the metaverse, are also factors that influence the sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Decentralized finance often relies on stablecoins for its operation. Meanwhile, the metaverse, a universe of 3D virtual worlds, also allows the use of cryptocurrencies to purchase goods or services, creating an immersive world.\n\nExperts in the sector believe that, despite the debacle that the cryptoasset market has experienced recently, decentralized finance \u2014 particularly via products backed by cryptoassets \u2014 is here to stay. This is because there is a market and players willing to participate.\n\nMoreover, they argue that while this sharp decline in cryptocurrency-related markets does remove some players, this is a welcome change. By the admission of Raoul Ullens, co-founder of Brussels Blockchain Week (an annual conference devoted to blockchain and cryptocurrencies):\n\nit is healthy, for the adoption, the maturation of these Web3 technologies, to skim, to rebalance the sector. [\u2026] An unhealthy ecosystem will not attract the masses.\n\nAccording to these players, such a drop in the cryptoasset markets is not only necessary, but also healthy, contributing as it does to rebalancing the valuation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptocurrencies are here to stay\n\nThe launch of cryptocurrencies by central banks, via central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), also lends weight to the argument that cryptoassets are here to stay. Indeed, the Bank of Canada is currently working on the creation of a CBDC. According to the institution, a CBDC issued by the Bank of Canada would be an \u201cofficial digital currency (that) would retain its face value in Canadian dollars because it is issued by the Bank of Canada, just like bank notes.\u201d\n\nOther nations in the world have already issued such a currency, including the Bahamas (Sand Dollar) and Nigeria (eNaira). One reason CBDCs are different from privately issued digital currencies (such as Bitcoin or Ethereum) is that their intended use is for transaction purposes only, not for investment or speculation. They offer the same possibilities of use as cash.\n\nCBDCs also aim to promote the financial inclusion of a part of the population that has little or no access to the traditional banking system, and to simplify the implementation of monetary and fiscal policy in the issuing countries.\n\nDevelopments in the world of digital currencies, whether in the metaverse or with the arrival of the CBDC, and the craze that they continue to generate, mean cryptocurrency is here to stay.\n\nThis durability means the form of cryptoassets take will continue to evolve and transform with the technologies that support them (notably, blockchains) and the variation in demand from users and/or investors."

        "title": "In rural Wisconsin, former employees lift curtain on troubled crypto mine - WisconsinWatch.org",
        "content": "Reading Time: 12 minutes\n\nTwo recently unemployed Chinese nationals weigh their options in a cramped Park Falls, Wisconsin, motel room, not far from where they worked in a former paper mill now being used to mine cryptocurrency.\n\nOne of them continues to nurse a stitched-up laceration across his left wrist from an on-the-job injury after he tripped while carrying a computer in August, a few months before he was let go.\n\nSpeaking in their native Mandarin, Aaron and Justin \u2014 as they refer to themselves in English \u2014 came to the United States on visas that allowed them to visit temporarily for \u201cbusiness activities\u201d but not to take jobs in America. The two said they thought they had a long-term future helping a global company, SOS Limited, establish a cryptocurrency mining operation in North America, one of just two known facilities in Wisconsin.\n\nWhat they found were what they described as unsafe working conditions and possible skirting of immigration and labor laws. Wisconsin Watch is not publishing their names because they are concerned about their legal status to work in the United States.\n\nThe two said they were abruptly fired and spent weeks holed up in the motel until they belatedly got their final month\u2019s salary from their employer.\n\nAaron and Justin, two Chinese nationals who formerly worked at a Park Falls, Wis., cryptocurrency mining operation, are seen in the motel lobby where they were staying after being let go from their jobs. Wisconsin Watch is not using their proper names and has blurred their faces to protect their identities. Photo taken on Dec. 1, 2022. (Tom LaVenture / Price County Review)\n\nTheir story is among several troubling signs that the company, which has just a handful of employees based in Park Falls, may not deliver the type of economic boost Park Falls was seeking when the city loaned one of SOS Limited\u2019s current partners $1 million to revive the paper mill, which once employed hundreds of workers. The company\u2019s two other announced North American cryptocurrency mining sites, including one in Marinette County, are also stalled.\n\nSince August, Bitcoin has lost almost three quarters of its cash value. And over the past two years, SOS Limited has seen 94% of its share value erased after raising more than $600 million from investors.\n\nThe story of the two Chinese nationals is also part of a larger tale about an economically challenged Midwestern mill town and the shadowy industry that produces Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies.\n\nCryptocurrency mining operations were prohibited in China in 2021 due to concerns over criminal activity and economic stability. They\u2019ve since moved to countries with laxer regulations such as the United States.\n\n\u201cThe (Chinese) government banned crypto mining operations in the country,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cThen, we saw an online post about hiring workers to the U.S.\u201d\n\nCrypto business takes root in rural Wisconsin\n\nA combination of local, regional and global factors brought two Chinese citizens to a town of 2,400 people in rural Price County, one of the least populated in the state.\n\nFor decades, Park Falls was a company town centered on the iconic Flambeau River paper mill built along the banks to harness hydroelectric power to run the plant.\n\nThe Flambeau Paper Co. in Park Falls, Wis., was built along the banks of the Flambeau River to harness hydroelectric power to run the plant. The mill once employed hundreds of people and provided the best-paid jobs in the community and the surrounding area. (Courtesy of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources)\n\n\u201cIt meant a lot to this community,\u201d said John Tapplin, a former mill employee who was president of the local union. \u201cAt one time it was probably dumping like a quarter million dollars every two weeks into the economy.\u201d\n\nBut the mill\u2019s future has been uncertain since its longtime owner sold it in 2006. It operated for little more than a decade, temporarily shutting down in 2019.\n\nThen New Jersey-based businessman Yong Liu and several investors stepped in and restarted operations the next year, buoying hopes that the paper mill could return to being the economic heart of the community. Some employees were called back to work.\n\nThe city issued a $1 million bridge loan to keep things running, but in the end a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and depressed commodity prices killed the business, recalled Mayor Michael Bablick.\n\n\u201cIt was sort of a slow drip for quite a while,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally, it just went down and just couldn\u2019t seem to find its way back open again.\u201d\n\nThe mill was sold off at auction to a liquidator. A number of creditors, including the city of Park Falls, went to court for payment. The judge ordered Liu\u2019s business interests to pay the remaining $828,108 of the loan earlier \u2014 a process that\u2019s still underway.\n\nSince then, the current owner has farmed out some of the space to various companies while dismantling other parts of the mill.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing, I think, all the things you\u2019d expect a liquidator to do,\u201d Bablick said. \u201cThey\u2019re removing equipment, they\u2019re removing valuable copper, things like that.\u201d\n\nBitcoin mining comes to Park Falls\n\nLast year SOS Limited, whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, began installing racks of computers inside the former paper mill to mine cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s vision is to become one of the leading block-chain technology service providers in North America,\u201d it wrote in a filing with financial regulators, referring to one of the key components of how cryptocurrencies are created and maintained.\n\nCryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have emerged over the past decade as a form of digital currency created by sophisticated computers solving complex computational problems to create unique strings of information. Mining operations compete with each other to work out these complex problems, thereby creating a digital currency that can be traded on the open market for hard currencies including U.S. dollars.\n\nPaper machines are seen at the Park Falls Pulp and Paper Co. in Park Falls, Wis., in this 2020 photo after it was reopened under an investor group that included New Jersey-based businessman Yong Liu. Liu also is involved in a cryptocurrency mining operation that replaced both the Pulp and Paper company and its former occupant, the Flambeau Paper Co., which have closed (Ben Meyer / WXPR)\n\nThe Chinese government has long been hostile to digital currencies, partly because it\u2019s difficult to regulate them, but also because the computers use massive amounts of energy, which has raised environmental concerns.\n\nIn a recent 46-page report, the White House estimated the greenhouse gas footprint of electricity powering U.S. cryptocurrency production in 2021 was equivalent to the average annual greenhouse gas emissions from 3 million gas-powered automobiles. The United States now hosts about one-third of global Bitcoin asset mining, the report said.\n\nIn Park Falls, the arrival in early 2022 of a cryptocurrency operation received a cool reception.\n\n\u201cThe city does not believe this use is the best use of the property in terms of jobs for our area, however, that is a matter solely for the owner of the mill to decide,\u201d City Administrator Brentt Michaelek stated on the Park Falls Facebook page.\n\nEven so, the site\u2019s industrial zoning meant the city couldn\u2019t stop it.\n\n\u201cOur legal analysis, and I think it\u2019s pretty common sense, (is) that you can probably run computer servers if you can run a paper mill,\u201d Bablick said.\n\nOfficials also found cryptocurrency mining preferable to the alternative: a fallow and blighted mill in the center of the city.\n\n\u201cThings can really go wrong in a huge industrial facility real quick when there\u2019s nobody there,\u201d he added.\n\nSOS Limited embroiled in controversy\n\nSOS Limited\u2019s arrival in Wisconsin coincided with the company\u2019s public acknowledgment that it\u2019s under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u201cThe company intends to cooperate with the SEC with respect to the investigation,\u201d SOS Limited wrote in a Feb. 25 filing with the financial regulator.\n\nThe SEC served a subpoena to the company following allegations of fraud raised by a pair of investment firms that publicize \u2014 and then profit from \u2014 publicly traded companies that mislead investors.\n\nThe investment firms\u2019 critical reports, published in February 2021, questioned the company\u2019s legitimacy as a cryptocurrency operation.\n\nThe former paper mill in Park Falls, Wis., operated for more than a century. (Courtesy of Jimmy S Emerson, DVM)\n\nHindenburg Research, which publishes information and makes stock bets on what it suspects are failing companies, seized on SOS Limited\u2019s publicity photos of another one of its alleged equipment suppliers. Other sources suggested that the photos were actually from an entirely different \u2014 and unconnected \u2014 Chinese cryptocurrency operation.\n\nAnother research firm released information that the company purportedly supplying SOS Limited with $20 million worth of computer equipment to mine cryptocurrencies was actually a shell company created to give the illusion of progress.\n\n\u201cWe find the company\u2019s claims regarding its supposed cryptocurrency mining purchases and acquisitions to be extremely problematic, if not fabricated entirely,\u201d Culper Research wrote in its Feb. 26, 2021 report.\n\nThe allegations came from short-seller investors who place bets that a stock\u2019s price will fall. That\u2019s controversial, but the researchers defend their methods, saying they shine a light on corporate misdeeds.\n\n\u201cOur business model is to find fraud and bet against companies that we think are engaging in fraud,\u201d Hindenburg\u2019s Nate Anderson told Wisconsin Watch. \u201cSo our positioning is aligned with our beliefs.\u201d\n\nAnderson said there are questionable lines in SOS Limited\u2019s recent regulatory filings that show $307 million of the more than $600 million raised by shareholders are \u201cunspecified receivables,\u201d meaning the company has not detailed what it\u2019s doing with roughly half the money that has poured in from investors.\n\nSOS Limited executives and attorneys did not answer questions emailed by Wisconsin Watch. But in a March 2021 web statement, the company denied what it calls \u201cdistorted, misleading, and unsubstantiated claims\u201d and pledged to answer its critics.\n\n\u201cSOS stands behind the integrity of the company and remains committed to maintaining transparency and the highest ethical principles,\u201d it said in a lengthy web statement.\n\n$5 million settlement reached\n\nThe company has agreed to pay $5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit by former shareholders who had sued following the allegations raised by the research firms. SOS Limited admitted no wrongdoing, but it also did not answer the core allegation contained in the complaint.\n\n\u201cThere has been a distinct lack of communication from SOS on its business operations, and its questionable deals,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cAnd it seems clear that shareholders want the answers to those questions.\u201d\n\nBut some investors hope the problems are more of a cultural disconnect than evidence of fraud.\n\nJ\u00f3zsef Gazs\u00f3 said he has bought about $32,000 worth of SOS stock since March 2020. He also handled investments for friends and family in his native Hungary.\n\n\u201cThis move to the U.S. was a good business move,\u201d Gazs\u00f3 told Wisconsin Watch from Budapest, where he works in logistics. \u201cIf they prove that they can mine in a safe and economic way, with renewable (energy) they have a huge upside potential.\u201d\n\nHe said his own firm in Hungary does business with a large Chinese company that\u2019s often averse to the type of investor relations and normal publicity that U.S. shareholders demand. He admitted he sometimes doubts the company will continue to issue new share offerings while showing little public progress in cryptocurrency mining.\n\n\u201cIf the company is a scam, I have been a fool,\u201d he texted after an interview with Wisconsin Watch.\n\nWisconsin expansion put on ice\n\nThe cryptocurrency operation quietly expanded in early 2022 by beginning to move its equipment outside the confines of the mill\u2019s thick walls.\n\nThe din of computers and cooling equipment has been a problem in other parts of the country including Niagara Falls, New York, a city that\u2019s used to the roar of North America\u2019s largest waterfall.\n\nIn Park Falls, Michaelek, the city administrator, said officials noticed the expansion had begun without the owner pulling any permits.\n\n\u201cThey were starting to put footings outside the building,\u201d he said. \u201cWe told them you can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nSOS Limited brought in additional electrical equipment to increase its power to run more cryptocurrency computers at a former paper mill in Park Falls, Wis. Some of this equipment is seen outside the plant on June 27, 2022. (Tom LaVenture / Price County Review)\n\nThe company came back with an application, but it was voted down in August because there was no engineering survey on how much noise the outdoor operation would generate.\n\nWhile that was happening, SOS investors hungry for updates looked to the Price County Review, a weekly newspaper headquartered in Phillips, the county seat, for updates on the cryptocurrency operation.\n\nCompany executives shared a write-up in the local newspaper, one of the few reports of progress on the ground after SOS had raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors.\n\nThe company last June released a short video, a rare public statement about its cryptocurrency operation in Wisconsin. It showed the interior of the Park Falls operation. The video was evidence of cryptocurrency mining at the first of three U.S. sites it had announced in April 2021.\n\nThat announcement described a partnership with U.S.-based holding companies with power agreements in Park Falls; Stacyville, Maine; and Niagara, Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cIf and when the site operations get underway, the company anticipates it will create significant jobs (sic) opportunities in the U.S.,\u201d the company wrote in an April 2021 press release.\n\nCrypto future unclear\n\nBut experts in Wisconsin are skeptical that cryptocurrency mining operations will ever offer meaningful employment after they are up and running.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s analogous to some other things like data centers,\u201d said Tom Still of the Wisconsin Technology Council, a Madison-based nonpartisan advocate for the state\u2019s tech industry. \u201cYou know, a lot goes into them in terms of construction but not necessarily a lot of employment afterwards.\u201d\n\nWet lap, a pulp product, is seen at the Park Falls Pulp and Paper Co. in Park Falls, Wis., in this 2020 file photo. Community members had hoped the plant would remain in operation as a paper mill, but it soon shut down and was sold to a liquidator. Part of the building is now being used for cryptocurrency mining. (Ben Meyer /WXPR)\n\nCryptocurrency production is largely unregulated in the United States, and it\u2019s unknown how many are in operation in Wisconsin. Still said he\u2019s aware of only one other cryptocurrency mine in the state: Digital Power Optimization\u2019s facility in the town of Hatfield, about 50 miles southeast of Eau Claire. The operation runs on renewable energy.\n\nAlex Stoewer, chief operating officer of New York-based Digital Power Optimization, said his firm\u2019s model of partnering with renewable energy producers is keeping it in the black.\n\n\u201cDespite the difficulties in the broader crypto market, this operation continues to generate positive cash flow, much of which is being reinvested in a maintenance plan for the hydro infrastructure, canal and dam,\u201d he said in a written statement.\n\nSOS expansion slowed elsewhere\n\n\u201cThe only information we ever had about it was inquiries from reporters, or from potential investors,\u201d she told Wisconsin Watch.\n\nAside from Park Falls, SOS Limited\u2019s other two projects in Maine and in Niagara, Wisconsin, have yet to materialize. Niagara city administrator Audrey Fredrick said there has been no activity on the site of a former paper mill since April 2021, when the company announced its plans in the city of 1,600 people in Marinette County along the Menominee River.\n\nBut she said there have been reports of people traveling to the city near Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula to see if there was anything happening.\n\n\u201cPeople tried to sneak on the site,\u201d Fredrick said. \u201cLike, investors who felt they were duped, and of course the site is secure because there\u2019s a landfill \u2026 and dangerous because there\u2019s a dam there \u2014 but no, there\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\nSOS Limited\u2019s U.S. partner in the three sites is Liu, who for nearly two years had owned the Park Falls mill. Reached briefly on his cellphone, he told Wisconsin Watch that so far only the Park Falls site has broken ground since there were technical hurdles in Maine and his company has yet to finalize a power buying agreement for the Niagara site in Marinette County.\n\n\u201cBut we built one in Texas in Fort Stockton,\u201d he added.\n\nTo date, there\u2019s been no mention of cryptocurrency mining in Texas in any of SOS\u2019s regulatory filings.\n\nImmigration questions loom\n\nAsked about the employment of Chinese nationals without work visas in Wisconsin, Liu said the men were contracted by clients in China that lease capacity to mine cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not our employees,\u201d he said.\n\nA contract signed by Aaron and reviewed by Wisconsin Watch shows he was employed by Shenzhen Beibeizhu Technology, also known as BBZ. The company is a main supplier of equipment to SOS Limited, and some shareholders have questioned in online forums the true nature of the two companies\u2019 relationship.\n\nAaron also signed a contract with SOS Limited\u2019s U.S. subsidiary.\n\n\u201cI have been communicating with the Shenzhen-based company for the promised work visa and job contract since my arrival,\u201d Aaron said.\n\nNew principal owner Yong Liu of Park Falls Industrial Management is seen at a ribbon cutting ceremony in 2020 for the newly opened Park Falls Pulp and Paper Co. in Park Falls, Wis., which closed after operating for about a year and a half. New Jersey-based Liu is a partner in SOS Limited\u2019s cryptocurrency mining operation now located on the site. (Ben Meyer / WXPR)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after the two were dismissed that Aaron learned the SOS Limited\u2019s U.S. contract wasn\u2019t signed by the company.\n\nAnd despite Aaron\u2019s arm injury, he had to continue lifting heavy equipment as part of the job.\n\nMing Luo, the site supervisor in Park Falls, declined to comment.\n\n\u201cMy company said that I should not talk too much,\u201d he said.\n\nHe referred questions back to Liu, who did not respond to subsequent calls and messages.\n\nAttorneys who advise undocumented immigrants said it appears both the employer and employees may have broken the law.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, they\u2019re both at risk because they have both potentially done things that are contrary to our immigration laws,\u201d said Erin Barbato, director of the Immigrant Justice Clinic at the University of Wisconsin Law School.\n\nShe said the two Chinese nationals run the risk of being arrested by federal authorities for working without the proper permits. But she said there\u2019s evidence suggesting they were lured under false pretenses by being offered a contract with the U.S. company, which means the employers could also be held responsible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very strange situation,\u201d she added.\n\nKeeping the lights on\n\nBablick, the Park Falls mayor, said the former paper mill is being underutilized as a cryptocurrency mine. And he said he\u2019s troubled by reports of workers going unpaid.\n\n\u201cThe (mill) owners could have done better as far as getting tenants in there, that would have been very useful for the town, and I tried to work with them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just, they made a business decision. It made sense for them. It wasn\u2019t the best for us.\u201d\n\nDespite the loss of employment at the Park Falls, Wis., paper plant, many former workers have found employment elsewhere. (Courtesy of Jimmy S Emerson, DVM)\n\nStill, he said, Park Falls is a resilient town that\u2019s weathered the transition remarkably well.\n\n\u201cBut I almost feel like the way it went away the last time was probably the best possible time,\u201d he said, \u201cjust because of the labor market constrictions and just the way the economy is.\u201d\n\nA worker-friendly labor market has meant that many former mill workers have found employment elsewhere. A decade ago, he said, there would have been lines of unemployed.\n\n\u201cEven though they\u2019re probably not making as much money as they used to be, they at least had an opportunity to find a job,\u201d he added.\n\nChinese workers seek new start\n\nIn the weeks after being dismissed from their job and offered a flight back to China without any guarantee of payment for their last month of work, Aaron and Justin spent several weeks in their hotel room, uncertain of their next move.\n\n\u201cThey have been asking me to go back to work, but I don\u2019t want to,\u201d Aaron told Wisconsin Watch on Dec. 6.\n\nDays later, they left Park Falls for good. By the middle of the month, they received their final salaries. Justin and Aaron are staying with friends in Chicago to figure out a way to remain in the United States.\n\nThey said they didn\u2019t encounter any prejudice against them personally during their time in Park Falls, but there was at least one unsettling sign that the foreign presence is unwelcome.\n\nInside the mill on a brick wall somebody scrawled in yellow paint a racist slur targeting the Chinese.\n\nThe nonprofit Wisconsin Watch (www.WisconsinWatch.org) collaborates with WPR, PBS Wisconsin, other news media and the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Journalism and Mass Communication.

The two said they thought they had a long-term future helping a global company, SOS Limited, establish a cryptocurrency mining operation in North America, one of just two known facilities in Wisconsin. </p> <p>What they found were what they described as unsafe working conditions and possible skirting of immigration and labor laws. Wisconsin Watch is not publishing their names because they are concerned about their legal status to work in the United States.</p> <p>The two said they were abruptly fired and spent weeks holed up in the motel until they belatedly got their final month\u2019s salary from their employer. </p> <figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02_Chinese_nationals-782x521.jpg\" alt=\"Two Chinese men with blurred faces standing together in a hotel lobby.\" class=\"wp-image-1275557\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Aaron and Justin, two Chinese nationals who formerly worked at a Park Falls, Wis., cryptocurrency mining operation, are seen in the motel lobby where they were staying after being let go from their jobs.

The company\u2019s two other announced North American cryptocurrency mining sites, including one in Marinette County, are also stalled.</p> <p>Since August, Bitcoin has lost almost three quarters of its cash value. And over the past two years, SOS Limited has seen 94% of its share value erased after raising more than $600 million from investors. </p> <p>The story of the two Chinese nationals is also part of a larger tale about an economically challenged Midwestern mill town and the shadowy industry that produces Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies.</p> <p>Cryptocurrency mining operations <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/01/what-s-behind-china-s-cryptocurrency-ban/\">were prohibited in China in 2021</a> due to concerns over criminal activity and economic stability. They\u2019ve since moved to countries with laxer regulations such as the United States.</p> <p>\u201cThe (Chinese) government banned crypto mining operations in the country,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cThen, we saw an online post about hiring workers to the U.S.\u201d</p> <h3><strong>Crypto business takes root in rural Wisconsin</strong></h3> <p>A combination of local, regional and global factors brought two Chinese citizens to a town of 2,400 people in rural Price County, one of the least populated in the state.</p> <p>For decades, Park Falls was a company town centered on the iconic Flambeau River paper mill built along the banks to harness hydroelectric power to run the plant.</p> <figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03_Flambeau-Paper-Company-1-782x1166.jpeg\" alt=\"An outdoor shot of a factory emitting steam into the sky.\" class=\"wp-image-1275560\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Flambeau Paper Co. in Park Falls, Wis., was built along the banks of the Flambeau River to harness hydroelectric power to run the plant. The mill once employed hundreds of people and provided the best-paid jobs in the community and the surrounding area. (Courtesy of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources)</figcaption></figure> <p>\u201cIt meant a lot to this community,\u201d said John Tapplin, a former mill employee who was president of the local union. \u201cAt one time it was probably dumping like a quarter million dollars every two weeks into the economy.\u201d</p> <p>But the mill\u2019s future has been uncertain since its longtime owner sold it in 2006. It operated for little more than a decade, temporarily shutting down in 2019.</p> <p>Then New Jersey-based businessman Yong Liu and several investors stepped in and restarted operations the next year, buoying hopes that the paper mill could return to being the economic heart of the community. Some employees were called back to work.</p> <p>The city issued a $1 million bridge loan to keep things running, but in the end a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and depressed commodity prices killed the business, recalled Mayor Michael Bablick.</p> <p>\u201cIt was sort of a slow drip for quite a while,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally, it just went down and just couldn\u2019t seem to find its way back open again.\u201d</p> <p>The mill was sold off at auction to a liquidator. A number of creditors, including the city of Park Falls, went to court for payment. The judge ordered Liu\u2019s business interests to pay the remaining $828,108 of the loan earlier \u2014 a process that\u2019s still underway.</p> <p>Since then, the current owner has farmed out some of the space to various companies while dismantling other parts of the mill.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing, I think, all the things you\u2019d expect a liquidator to do,\u201d Bablick said. \u201cThey\u2019re removing equipment, they\u2019re removing valuable copper, things like that.\u201d</p> <h3><strong>Bitcoin mining comes to Park Falls</strong></h3> <p>Last year SOS Limited, whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, began installing racks of computers inside the former paper mill to mine cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>\u201cThe company\u2019s vision is to become one of the leading block-chain technology service providers in North America,\u201d it wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1346610/000121390022070217/f6k1122ex99-1_sosltd.htm\">filing with financial regulators</a>, referring to one of the key components of how cryptocurrencies are created and maintained.</p> <p>Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have emerged over the past decade as a form of digital currency created by sophisticated computers solving complex computational problems to create unique strings of information. Mining operations compete with each other to work out these complex problems, thereby creating a digital currency that can be traded on the open market for hard currencies including U.S. dollars. </p> <figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04_Park-Falls_interior_01-1-782x482.jpeg\" alt=\"The inside of a factory housing paper machines.\" class=\"wp-image-1275561\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Paper machines are seen at the Park Falls Pulp and Paper Co. in Park Falls, Wis., in this 2020 photo after it was reopened under an investor group that included New Jersey-based businessman Yong Liu.

But in a <a href=\"https://soslimited.us/f/sos-limited-fights-back-hindenburg-research-short-report-fraud\">March 2021 web statement</a>, the company <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sos-limited-responds-to-misleading-short-and-distort-allegations-301237199.html\">denied what it calls \u201cdistorted, misleading, and unsubstantiated claims</a>\u201d and pledged to answer its critics. </p> <p>\u201cSOS stands behind the integrity of the company and remains committed to maintaining transparency and the highest ethical principles,\u201d it said in a lengthy web statement.</p> <h3><strong>$5 million settlement reached</strong></h3> <p>The company has <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23509861-order-granting-preliminary-approval?responsive=1&title=1\">agreed to pay $5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit by former shareholders</a> who had sued following the allegations raised by the research firms. SOS Limited admitted no wrongdoing, but it also did not answer the core allegation contained in the complaint.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a distinct lack of communication from SOS on its business operations, and its questionable deals,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cAnd it seems clear that shareholders want the answers to those questions.\u201d</p> <p>But some investors hope the problems are more of a cultural disconnect than evidence of fraud. </p> <p>J\u00f3zsef Gazs\u00f3 said he has bought about $32,000 worth of SOS stock since March 2020. He also handled investments for friends and family in his native Hungary.</p> <p>\u201cThis move to the U.S. was a good business move,\u201d Gazs\u00f3 told Wisconsin Watch from Budapest, where he works in logistics. \u201cIf they prove that they can mine in a safe and economic way, with renewable (energy) they have a huge upside potential.\u201d</p> <p>He said his own firm in Hungary does business with a large Chinese company that\u2019s often averse to the type of investor relations and normal publicity that U.S. shareholders demand.

Niagara city administrator Audrey Fredrick said there has been no activity on the site of a former paper mill since April 2021, when the company announced its plans in the city of 1,600 people in Marinette County along the Menominee River.</p> <p>But she said there have been reports of people traveling to the city near Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula to see if there was anything happening.</p> <p>\u201cPeople tried to sneak on the site,\u201d Fredrick said. \u201cLike, investors who felt they were duped, and of course the site is secure because there\u2019s a landfill \u2026 and dangerous because there\u2019s a dam there \u2014 but no, there\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p> <p>SOS Limited\u2019s U.S. partner in the three sites is Liu, who for nearly two years had owned the Park Falls mill. Reached briefly on his cellphone, he told Wisconsin Watch that so far only the Park Falls site has broken ground since there were technical hurdles in Maine and his company has yet to finalize a power buying agreement for the Niagara site in Marinette County. </p> <p>\u201cBut we built one in Texas in Fort Stockton,\u201d he added.</p> <p>To date, there\u2019s been no mention of cryptocurrency mining in Texas in any of SOS\u2019s regulatory filings. </p> <h3><strong>Immigration questions loom</strong></h3> <p>Asked about the employment of Chinese nationals without work visas in Wisconsin, Liu said the men were contracted by clients in China that lease capacity to mine cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not our employees,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A contract signed by Aaron and reviewed by Wisconsin Watch shows he was employed by Shenzhen Beibeizhu Technology, also known as BBZ. The company is a main supplier of equipment to SOS Limited, and some shareholders have <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SOSStock/comments/x1q401/shenzhen_baodelin_investment_holding_co_and_sos/\">questioned in online forums</a> the true nature of the two companies\u2019 relationship.</p> <p>Aaron also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23574295-employment-contract-signed?responsive=1&title=1\">signed a contract with SOS Limited\u2019s U.S. subsidiary</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI have been communicating with the Shenzhen-based company for the promised work visa and job contract since my arrival,\u201d Aaron said.</p> <figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08_Yong-Liu-copy-782x522.jpg\" alt=\"A male executive speaks at a ribbon cutting ceremony.\" class=\"wp-image-1275580\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">New principal owner Yong Liu of Park Falls Industrial Management is seen at a ribbon cutting ceremony in 2020 for the newly opened Park Falls Pulp and Paper Co. in Park Falls, Wis., which closed after operating for about a year and a half.

But she said there\u2019s evidence suggesting they were lured under false pretenses by being offered a contract with the U.S. company, which means the employers could also be held responsible. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very strange situation,\u201d she added.</p> <h3><strong>Keeping the lights on</strong></h3> <p>Bablick, the Park Falls mayor, said the former paper mill is being underutilized as a cryptocurrency mine.

Justin and Aaron are staying with friends in Chicago to figure out a way to remain in the United States.</p> <p>They said they didn\u2019t encounter any prejudice against them personally during their time in Park Falls, but there was at least one unsettling sign that the foreign presence is unwelcome.</p> <p>Inside the mill on a brick wall somebody scrawled in yellow paint a racist slur targeting the Chinese.</p> <p><em>The nonprofit Wisconsin Watch (</em><a href=\"http://www.wisconsinwatch.org\"><em>www.WisconsinWatch.org</em></a><em>) collaborates with WPR, PBS Wisconsin, other news media and the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Journalism and Mass Communication.

        "content": "A handful of big players pull all the strings when it comes to the cryptocurrency market.\n\nA handful of big players pull all the strings when it comes to the cryptocurrency market. Credit: GETTY\n\nWe're not just a couple of weeks into 2023 and crypto prices are spiking. Seeing number go up might entice you to throw some money into Bitcoin or Ethereum. After all, maybe this is the beginning of another crypto bull market? You wouldn't want to miss out!\n\nWell, just wait a minute. Consider this first: Why are crypto prices suddenly rising?\n\nThere are plenty of analysts out there trying to make logical sense of the recent bump in cryptocurrencies value \u2013 inflation is slowing , belief that the Federal Reserve is done with hiking interest rate hiking, bullish news on crypto \u2013 but no, that's not really it.\n\nThere's been no big positive news in the industry. There aren't reports of some new, mainstream avenues of adoption. Sure, the stock market is up a bit right now in the new year, but not at the same level cryptocurrency is.\n\nSo, what's going on here? Market manipulation.\n\nBitcoin is riding high, but isn't heading to the moon anytime soon\n\nBitcoin is hovering over $21,000 as of mid-January, a price that has not been seen since early November 2022. That was before the collapse of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world. Crypto took a pounding in 2022, as major stablecoins, lenders, and other crypto companies failed, causing domino effects throughout the industry.\n\nHowever, things are not looking up. Even though one of the most tumultuous years for crypto is behind us, 2023 thus far has not treated crypto much better with the failure of Gemini Earn and crypto lender Nexo's offices being raided over allegations of illegal activity. There's no good news on the horizon. In addition, the majority of retail inventors now view cryptocurrency as too risky , so who's buying?\n\nAs longtime cryptocurrency writer and critic David Gerard explains: The big players in the industry are \"buying\" in order to control the market.\n\n\"The bitcoin price is whatever the large players need it to be,\" writes Gerard. \"The market is very thin and trivially manipulable with the billions of pseudo-dollars in unbacked stablecoins on the unregulated offshore exchanges. The price needs to be high enough so the big boys' loans don't get liquidated; but it needs to be low enough so that the bagholders don't attempt to cash out.\"\n\nJohn Reed Stark, a former SEC official, concurred with Gerard's assessment.\n\n\"\u200b\u200bA recent Forbes analysis of 157 crypto exchanges found that 51 percent of daily bitcoin trading volume being reported was likely bogus,\" tweeted Stark, referring to a Forbes report from last summer.\n\nWho is doing the buying? It's not clear\n\nA more recent study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that \"wash trades accounted for up to 70 percent of all transactions on non-compliant crypto exchanges, suggesting most trades on these platforms are fraudulent.\"\n\nWash trading is basically when an investor trades with itself in order to make it look like there is activity in the market in order to boost value. Basically, it's market manipulation.\n\nSo when you hear investment advice from people like Anthony Scaramucci, the guy who worked as communication director for Trump's White House for about 10 days in 2017, proceed with caution. Scaramucci now heads up an investment firm called SkyBridge Capital and recently told CNBC that 2023 will be a \"recovery year\" for Bitcoin, with prices skyrocketing backup to new highs in two or three years.\n\nIt's important to note that 30 percent of SkyBridge Capital was bought out by FTX about two months before the exchange collapsed. The firm made significant crypto investments with the tens of millions from that deal, right before crypto tanked even further. Scaramucci recently said that he's hoping that SkyBridge can buy back the stake it sold to FTX. So, it's not too shocking for Scaramucci to be putting \"good vibes\" out there for crypto so the firm can make a return on their investments.\n\nIt's just yet another way the big crypto companies and investment funds manipulate the market."

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nThe crypto market has experienced a major decline in 2022, with most stocks losing 70-90 percent or more in value. However, due to a slight increase in the value of Bitcoin, the overall sector has seen larger gains recently. Bitcoin, currently trading at $20,800, has risen about 20 percent this week, reaching its highest point in over two months since the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange.This week, there were several stocks that experienced notable gains, with Coinbase (COIN) experiencing a 49 percent increase. Despite facing sell-side downgrades, price target cuts and a credit rating downgrade, Coinbase saw an investment from Cathie Wood's ARK Investment, which purchased $7.5 million worth of Coinbase stock this week and around $28.5 million in the last month.Coming into 2023, Bitcoin miners were looking forward to a difficult situation due to a combination of factors, including a low Bitcoin price, increasing electricity costs, high debt levels, and limited access to capital. These factors also led to financial struggles for some miners, with Core Scientific filing for bankruptcy and Argo Blockchain narrowly avoiding it after receiving financial aid from Galaxy Digital.The situation for crypto miners had become so dire that one of the major players in the industry, Riot Blockchain, decided to distance itself from the industry by changing its name to Riot Platforms in order to avoid association with crypto.Due to this ongoing situation, the recent uptrend in the price of Bitcoin means the shares of companies in the Bitcoin mining sector have seen significant increases.For example, Marathon Digital has seen a 79 percent increase in its stock this week, Hut 8 Mining has risen by 49 percent, Bit Digital has gone up 41 percent, and Riot has gained 27 percent."

        "content": "Veteran trader Peter Brandt is predicting a bullish scenario for Bitcoin (BTC) that could propel the king crypto to a fresh all-time high in two years.\n\nBrandt tells his 692,600 Twitter followers that while it is within the realm of possibility for Bitcoin to launch a new bull market this year, in reality, nobody knows what will really happen.\n\n\u201cAny idiot can make wild guesses about markets, so here is my dunce-hat prediction. In reality, nobody has a clue what any given market will do.\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he appears to be outlining a possible inverse head and shoulders pattern for Bitcoin that could push BTC above $30,000 by Q2 of this year. An inverse head and shoulders formation is one of the patterns that traders look for as it indicates the potential end of a downtrend.\n\nBrandt also shares a chart that shows Bitcoin\u2019s possible long-term price action.\n\nBased on the trader\u2019s chart, Bitcoin could start a new bull market after breaking out of the inverse head and shoulders pattern en route to $70,000 first before correcting back to $33,000 and then rallying to around $175,000 in 2025.\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is switching hands for $21,050. A move toward Brandt\u2019s long-term target suggests an upside potential of over 731% for the king crypto.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A security strategist who spent months undercover on the darkweb published a report on Monday that offers insight into one of the world\u2019s most notorious ransomware groups, claiming its members are using internet services owned by billionaire Elon Musk and laundering money through Hong Kong and China.\n\nLockBit\u2019s PR stunts online have included encouraging followers on the dark web to get tattoos of the syndicate\u2019s logo. (Photo: courtesy of Jon DiMaggio, Analyst1)Jon DiMaggio, Chief Security Strategist at threat intelligence platform Analyst1 released his findings about LockBit in a report called Ransomware Diaries: Volume 1. He said he used fake personas to communicate with members of the cybercriminal syndicate and learn more about their operations.\n\n\u201cLockBit is, right now, by far the worst among all the ransomware gangs,\u201d DiMaggio told OCCRP. \u201cThey have by far the highest volume of attacks, and that\u2019s a fact. They\u2019re running the ransomware scene.\u201d\n\nHe explained that until now, relatively little effort has been put into profiling the actors behind such cybercriminal syndicates. \u201cI believe this is the first publicly-available, in-depth profile of any ransomware group,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to get more people doing this, collecting data from the dark web, from these private channels, from the press releases on their websites. All this low-hanging fruit, it helps us better understand the adversary,\u201d the expert said.\n\nAccording to his report, LockBit\u2019s leadership has been interacting with the wider cybercriminal community via dark web forums and private channels under the pseudonym LockBitSupp. This persona claims the group accesses its back-end infrastructure via Starlink, a U.S. satellite internet service owned by Musk\u2019s SpaceX, and that they primarily rely on Bitcoin exchanges located in Hong Kong and China to launder proceeds from their ransomware campaigns.\n\nThe report also reveals LockBit\u2019s close association with several other high-profile ransomware gangs. Though these relationships remain largely adversarial, due to the increasingly competitive nature of the global market for cybercriminal services, LockBit\u2019s leadership appear to maintain a direct line of communication with multiple other criminal syndicates \u2013 including BlackCat, Hive, REvil, and DarkSide/BlackMatter, widely believed to have been responsible for the 2021 U.S. Colonial Pipeline cyberattack.\n\n\u201cMost of these relationships \u2013 not all, but most \u2013 started off well enough. But criminals have no ethics, so it\u2019s usually just a matter of time before they step on each other\u2019s toes and start pissing each other off,\u201d DiMaggio said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, you\u2019ve still got a lot of people who all know each other, who all run in the same circles, and who remain in communication with one another.\u201d\n\nLockBit also has ties to the ransomware group Blackbasta, formerly Conti, who were behind a series of large-scale cyber attacks that effectively paralyzed the Costa Rican government last year. According to LockBitSupp, DiMaggio says, Blackbasta are working for the Russian government, providing direct technical support to the FSB.\n\nOCCRP previously reported how Moscow is likely to turn to cybercriminal proxies in launching future attacks against critical infrastructure in the West. In part because of the sheer scale and sophistication of Russia\u2019s market for cybercriminal services, but also because of the \u201cplausible deniability\u201d afforded by such tactics.\n\nBeyond this, experts have also expressed alarm over the growing diversification of services and operational models within the cybercriminal community in recent years. The competition across this increasingly reputation-driven criminal sector is fierce, and has also created opportunities for accomplished hackers to effectively work as freelancers for multiple groups. It\u2019s a trend keenly reflected by LockBit\u2019s operations over the past few months, during which the group\u2019s leadership has engaged in multiple smear campaigns against rival ransomware gangs, as well as launching several PR-stunts to promote their services and attract new blood.\n\nThe latter has included a \u201csummer paper contest\u201d, in which applicants were encouraged to submit academic-style papers on different hacking techniques, with the winner awarded a monetary prize. According to DiMaggio, this speaks to LockBit\u2019s \u201coutside-the-box\u201d approach to raising awareness of their operations among prospective clients, as well as identifying and recruiting smart and upcoming cybercriminals, though their leaders\u2019 showmanship has apparently attracted censure from other members of the cybercriminal community.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, this is a very successful person, but who\u2019s also very arrogant and insecure,\u201d DiMaggio says. \u201cThey play a good chess game, but there\u2019s a growing negative sentiment among other criminals who\u2019re tired of the ego and constant chest pounding.\u201d"

        "title": "Is the Bitcoin price spike a bull trap? - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s recent price action has left crypto investors and traders pleasantly surprised. After hovering within the $16,000 to $17,000 range for nearly a month, BTC jumped 20 percent over the last week. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation marched from $16,997 on January 13 to $21,224 on January 16.\n\nThis price spike filled the market with hope, especially after the disastrous events of 2023. However, several prominent traders and analysts believe that the recent upward trend is nothing but a bull trap that will cause pain for those who jump onto the BTC bandwagon at current prices. But what is a bull trap and why do experts think that Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally classifies as one? Tag along to find out.\n\nBull traps: What are they?\n\nA bull trap refers to an upward trend that deceives investors into thinking that a certain asset is headed for further gains when it is actually going to drop. Such a price action usually occurs when a cryptocurrency undergoes random and rapid price increases. Market participants see the rise as an opportunity to buy in, believing that the trend will continue. However, the price suddenly drops, and investors are trapped with glaring losses.\n\nBull traps are characterised by sudden price spikes, accompanied by low trading volumes, overbought indicators and negative market sentiment. At the time of writing, BTC\u2019s trading volume was down 4.87 percent over the last 24 hours and its RSI was 71.57, which is generally considered \u201coverbought.\u201d Moreover, while the digital asset market is in the green since the start of the New Year, the crypto winter still rages on and several web3 firms are feeling the cold. Plenty of large companies have even announced job cuts this month.\n\nConditions like these have led many prominent traders, analysts and investors to believe that BTC\u2019s current price rally is indeed a bull trap. For instance, popular crypto analyst, Il Capo Of Crypto, referred to the BTC spike as one of the \u201cbiggest bull traps\u201d he had ever seen. In the same Twitter thread, Il Capo also validated his opinion through a host of technical indicators and other market factors.\n\n\"This is the bull trap I was speaking about,\" said another prominent analyst, Toni Ghinea, on Jan 14, just as BTC began its march to $21,000. According to Ghinea, BTC will drop to $14,000 in the coming months. On the other hand, Il Capo believes BTC will plummet to $12,000 before the bulls can take over. And it\u2019s not just experts. Even regular traders and investors believe that BTC is currently a bull trap. As per a CoinTelegraph Twitter Poll, more than 60 percent of 5,000 voters believe that the current rally is a bull trap.\n\nThere are optimistic investors and traders too\n\nNot all experts agree with the bull trap theory. Some believe that BTC experienced a genuine uptrend last week and that it could continue to reach new heights in 2023. For instance, on Jan 5, prominent venture capitalist, Tim Draper, stated that BTC could touch $250,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nProfessor of finance at Sussex University, Carol Alexander, believes that BTC is headed for $30,000 by Q1 of 2023. \u201cThere will be a managed bull market in 2023, not a bubble \u2014 so we won\u2019t see the price overshooting as before,\u201d Carol told CNBC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see a month or two of stable trending prices interspersed with range-bounded periods and probably a couple of short-lived crashes,\u201d she added. Carol believes that BTC will touch $50,000 by the end of the year.\n\nMoreover, a machine learning tool designed by PricePredictions states that BTC will maintain its valuation in Feb. The model predicts that Bitcoin will stay its course around the $21,000 mark going into the next month and continue growing from there.\n\nIn addition, several technical indicators also point towards a breakout in the coming months. For instance, according to TradingView, BTC is forming a falling wedge pattern, a bullish signs that\u2019s often followed by a breakout. Further, the platform\u2019s technical meter points to \u201cbuy\u201d for Bitcoin at the moment. Further, several of Bitcoin\u2019s moving average indicators also point to a \u201cstrong buy\u201d. Finally, BTC has managed to hover within the $21,000 range over the last couple of days, indicating support at this price level.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell where BTC is headed next. Several analyst and technical indicators point one way, while another set of experts and indicators tell us something else altogether. However, with halving approaching us in 2024, Bitcoin should see a rise as the number of coins entering circulation slows and supply becomes scarce. However, until then, all we can do is wait and watch. Bitcoin was trading at $21,216 at the time of writing, up 1.86 percent over the last 24 hours."

        "title": "'Best regards and HODL on!': Celsius customer's fury as $100000 in Bitcoin trapped in collapsed crypto lender - DLNews",
        "content": "The morning of Monday, June 13, 2022, started badly for Fred Shanks.\n\nIn his inbox was an email from Celsius Network, telling him it had issued a margin call on a $10,000 loan he had taken out with the company. The crypto lender requested about $3,000 from Shanks or the company would liquidate his collateral \u2014 meaning it would keep all the Bitcoin he posted to get the loan, and charge him a 3% fee on top for doing so.\n\nShanks, 61, was eager to meet the margin call, but on that day, Hoboken, New Jersey-based Celsius froze his account and refused to let him use CEL, its native token currency, to pay off the interest he owed.\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t know was that Celsius was on the verge of collapse - it filed for bankruptcy protection one month later, on July 13. Shanks, a retired Air Force IT worker in Colorado Springs, Colorado, was one of hundreds of thousands whose accounts had been frozen, preventing customers from withdrawing their crypto from the platform.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nConversations with Shanks, as well as emails between him and Celsius employees obtained from US federal bankruptcy court, give a glimpse into the personal hell experienced by 1.7 million Celsius customers whose crypto is in limbo.\n\nThe correspondence details the unfolding drama as Celsius demanded money from Shanks to secure his loan, and as Shanks desperately tried to access and transfer the money from his Celsius accounts.\n\nAt each step, Celsius refused to resolve the margin call because his accounts were frozen. And yet Celsius repeatedly renewed a demand for the money.\n\nBehind the scenes, a former Celsius executive told DL News that the company was scrambling to stem a bank run. As regulators investigate, the company, along with cofounder and CEO Alex Mashinsky, face lawsuits. Kirkland & Ellis, the law firm advising Celsius, said in a filing that Celsius had a near $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet. Kirkland & Ellis did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n$100,000 trapped in a frozen account\n\nFor Shanks, 61, the margin call was just the beginning. He had about $100,000 in cryptocurrency stashed on Celsius \u2014 a quarter of his savings from his days in the military before he retired in 2000. He was suddenly unable to access any of it.\n\nThe stress of dealing with Celsius has made Shanks lose weight, he told DL News.\n\nSolving the problem should have been simple: As part of the loan agreement, Shanks had initially posted collateral, $20,000 in Bitcoin, to receive the $10,000 loan. \u201cI needed the money to pay for some medical stuff. I knew I could pay it off in six to 12 months,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cI just saw the loan as leveraging the Bitcoin I had instead of selling it.\u201d\n\nBut in May of that year, Bitcoin plummeted. It had been sitting at about $46,000 in late March. As spring turned to summer, the price fell toward $20,000.\n\nThat meant the value of his Bitcoin collateral had fallen below $7,000, and the margin between the $20,000 loan and the collateral was now greater than $13,000, or 65%. The margin was supposed to be 50%. If he could just add about $3,000 or more in Bitcoin, the margin call would be resolved and he would not risk losing all the Bitcoin he posted as collateral.\n\n\u2018How can a margin call be resolved if all accounts are locked?\u2019\n\nBut Celsius had frozen his accounts without informing him, court documents allege. That included about $100,000 of his Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cHow can I resolve this,\u201d Shanks replied on the day he received the margin call. He wrote again later that day: \u201cHow can a margin call be resolved if all accounts are locked. NO transfers are allowed.\u201d\n\nOn June 14, at 2.41 p.m., Shanks received what looked like good news. An email from Celsius staffer Nicoletta Koursari said: \u201cThe easiest way to balance your loan LTV level and close the margin call is to add additional crypto as collateral directly through your Celsius mobile app.\u201d\n\nShe closed her message with, \u201cBest regards and HODL on!\u201d\n\nBut Shanks couldn\u2019t do that. He replied: \u201cCelsius is missing the point. I have excess BTC in my account that I could transfer to cover the required amount... Celsius needs to lift this freeze.\u201d\n\nCelsius halts withdrawals\n\nNine minutes later, Koursari replied, \u201cWe are pausing all withdrawals, Swaps, and transfers between accounts. This necessary action has been taken to stabilise liquidity and operations. Our intent is to honour, over time, our withdrawal obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, in order to resolve the margin call by adding collateral to your loan, additional funds are required to be transferred to the Custody account,\u201d she added. \u201cAlternatively, you can close the loan.\u201d DL News was unable to reach Koursari for comment.\n\nShanks was outraged. Not only was his $100,000 in Bitcoin stuck in a frozen account, but the company now demanded he send them even more to cover the margin call.\n\n\u2018Your account is not frozen\u2019\n\n\u201cI was betrayed, I was lied to, I felt deceived,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThis mainly was over email because I know if it\u2019s not in writing, you have nothing to back up your statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would say, \u2018Oh, your account is not frozen, we can help you.\u2019 But whenever I put it in writing, it came back with the typical social-media script.\u201d\n\nShanks says he hopes to demonstrate to the court that he tried to close out his accounts before the company filed for bankruptcy, and that therefore his assets should not be distributed as part of the bankruptcy estate \u2014 creditors generally get pennies on the dollar once a company\u2019s assets are sold and distributed to those who are owed money.\n\nOn June 14, the messages from Celsius grew even more confusing. At one moment, a staffer would insist that Shanks could pay off his loan. At another, he was told his accounts were frozen.\n\nShanks wrote to one of them: \u201cCelsius has frozen all accounts preventing me from transferring the required number of coins to cover the margin call. Unless Celsius unfreeze the account, I CAN NOT meet the requirements of the loan for the margin call.\u201d\n\nThe staffer who replied said, \u201cWe would love to help out, but I\u2019m afraid your inquiry is not clear to us as your account is not frozen.\u201d\n\nShanks sent them another email:\n\n\u201cDo you NOT see the issue\u2026 I have provided a screenshot to try and explain.\u201d\n\nA lifeline\n\nAnother Celsius staffer, identified only as Bojan, appeared to offer Shanks a lifeline.\n\nHe told Shanks in an email later on June 14: \u201cWe can initiate a transfer of assets from the Earn service [an interest-bearing account] to your Custody Wallet in order to respond to your prior Margin Call. \u2026 If you wish to proceed, please confirm by indicating below that you \u2018Confirm\u2019 the transfer.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease note that, if you proceed, your account may be temporarily placed on HODL mode while we process these transactions,\u201d Bojan also said. \u201cHODL mode\u201d was the company\u2019s way of disabling an account temporarily.\n\nShanks approved the transfer 19 minutes later, the emails show.\n\nAt this point, Shanks thought he had resolved the margin call. Bojan emailed him to confirm: \u201cYour request for internal transfer has been escalated to our dedicated team, and we will notify you as soon as the action is completed.\u201d\n\nCelsius declines to accept its own tokens\n\nBut he also added a technicality: \u201cIn addition, recently the CEL token has been paused, and currently, we can\u2019t accept it for the loan interest payments.\u201d\n\nCEL was the native crypto on Celsius that the company had suggested customers use to pay off interest on their loans, according to Shanks\u2019 complaint in US federal bankruptcy court. Shanks sent another email, boiling with frustration: \u201cWHY is cel no longer an option to be able to pay the interest. i have purchased cell for this is [sic] exact purpose\u201d?\n\nAt this point, Shanks changed his mind. With the price of Bitcoin continuing to crash, he decided to pay off the loan entirely, not just the margin call.\n\nCelsius staffer Kira Airy offered to help him do it. \u201cDo you need assistance with closing your loan? I\u2019d be more than happy to help,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShanks replied three minutes later: \u201cYes, please do help\u2026 I need to swap the all cel coins to usdc coins. The [sic] what ever is needed to swap from BTC to usdc coin to pay off the loan.\u201d\n\nBut 23 minutes after that, Airy declined to let him pay the loan: \u201cCurrently, withdrawals, swaps, and transfers between accounts have been stopped,\u201d she wrote.\n\nOn June 16, at 8:45 a.m., she elaborated: \u201cWe need to receive the loan principal in one of our approved Stablecoins,\u201d which included USDC and USDT, among others.\n\nNotably, Celsius wouldn\u2019t accept CEL, its native token, in payment.\n\n\u2018We can\u2019t swap coins on your behalf\u2019\n\nShanks persisted. At 11:20 a.m. on June 16 he told her: \u201cAs I stated, swap cel coins for usdc coins. Swap BTC FOR USDC COIN for the required amount to pay off the loan.\u201d\n\nAiry wasn\u2019t having it: \u201cHi Fred, We can\u2019t swap coins on your behalf. Best, Kira.\u201d\n\nShanks became sarcastic: \u201cThen how does Celsius plan to resolve this issue. As celsius created the enigma of preventing account holders from managing their funds to resolve payments and closing of loans.\u201d\n\nAiry kept it professional. \u201cHi Fred, Our operations continue and we will continue to share information with the community as it becomes available,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPlease let us know how you\u2019d wish to proceed with your current loan.\u201d\n\nFour minutes later, Shanks said: \u201cI wish to close the loan with the funds I have available in my account\u2026 Why would I send more funds to a company that is hold [sic] over 100k dollars of mine hostage?\u201d Airy did not respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nThat was the last email between Shanks and Celsius.\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nBehind the scenes, Celsius executives were trying to make customers whole, said Rohit Sabhlok, who at the time was the lead for crypto trading architecture at Celsius.\n\n\u201cThe company was not trying to steal people\u2019s money,\u201d Sabhlok told DL News. He has since left Celsius to cofound KYAX.com, which helps crypto companies with audit, tax, and regulatory requirements.\n\nAs crypto prices plummeted, \u201cthat started a bank run on the institution \u2014 and no one withstands a bank run. Once you crush that liquid reserve,\u201d it\u2019s over, he said.\n\nInternally, Celsius executives noticed that some institutional customers were taking out funds. But retail customers \u2014 ordinary individual investors \u2014 were moving more slowly. Rather than leave the retail customers to bear the full brunt of the withdrawals, a decision was made to stop all withdrawals, Sabhlok said.\n\n\u201cWe started working out where our assets were liquid and selling them, to pay customers\u2019 returns. But there\u2019s only so much we can take. We were selling out to pay people back. We then decided, \u2018That was it, we can\u2019t really go on.\u2019\u201d\n\nShanks told DL News: \u201cI felt violated. I felt like they literally stole my money and stole my rights, as if they didn\u2019t have to abide by the laws. The contracts were useless.\u201d"

        "title": "\u202a\u201dMarket Manipulation?\u201d \u2014 Former SEC Official Reveals Factors Propelling Bitcoin\u2019s Latest Price Ascent - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent price performance has turned many heads in the cryptocurrency market this year. The asset\u2019s bullish price movement has elicited notable reactions from John Reed Stark, the former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Office of Internet Enforcement.\n\nLike many other key figures, Reed has taken to Twitter to disclose what he believes is a main factor behind the recent upsurge in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s price is rising for one reason: Market Manipulation. A recent Forbes analysis of 157 crypto exchanges found that 51% of daily bitcoin trading volume being reported was likely bogus (and that was the tip of the iceberg).\u201d Reed asserted in a recent tweet.\n\nHis tweets echo the sentiments of David Gerard, a journalist and author, who, in previous times, have postulated bearish viewpoints on digital currencies and blockchains.\n\nGerard explains that the reason for Bitcoin\u2019s rise to $20,000 is not tied to any \u201cmacroeconomic actions, regulatory announcements or the strength of the dollar.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe maintains that market manipulation is at play, pointing to the recent news of Gemini and Genesis being sued by the SEC, as some of the bearish events that lead him to believe that price pumps are usually \u201cbad news for major players.\u201d\n\nBitcoin taps $21,000; where\u2019s the big bull headed next?\n\nIt bears mentioning that a lot of key figures are rather bullish on Bitcoin and the majority of cryptocurrencies than they are bearish.\n\nCrypto influencer Ben Armstrong is one of the notable figures predicting that Bitcoin is heading towards $25,000 or $30,000 in the next 45 days, although he believes the asset might hover between $20,000 to $25,000 for most of 2023.\n\nSimilarly, PlanB, the creator of the Bitcoin S2F model, is also eyeing Bitcoin at $32,000 in 2024. He expects that price to triple and reach $100,000 during the bull run in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, at press time, Bitcoin is valued at a price of $21,212. The asset managed to sustain gains of over 20% throughout the last week.\n\nBTCUSD Chart by TradingView\n\nHowever, traders seem convinced that the crypto market is nearing the top. As Santiment, the leading market intelligence platform explained in a recent tweet;\n\n\u201cAre crypto markets seeing a top? Traders are behaving like they believe so, taking this opportunity to profit while given the chance. Bitcoin is seeing its highest profit tx ratio since Feb, 2021. For Ethereum, it\u2019s the highest since Oct, 2021.\u201d"

The announcement was made by\n\nAssociate Professor Korok Ray of Mays Business School, who will be teaching the \"Bitcoin Protocol\" course to students in the\n\nCollege of Engineering and Mays Business School.\n\nI will be teaching the first ever Bitcoin class at Texas A&M this spring! \u2014 Korok Ray (@KorokRay) January 12, 2023\n\nadvertisement\n\nRay spoke about the curriculum in a 4 part tweet thread stating that the \"Programming Bitcoin\" series will follow the Bitcoin Protocol where students will be taught how to \"build a Bitcoin library from scratch.\"\n\nWas not easy convincing committee\n\nThe professor added that it was not easy convincing the college to add the Bitcoin course to the curriculum and he had to wait for months to get the programme approved by the college's curriculum committee body. However, it is not yet certain how many students have enrolled for this course.\n\nIt has been observed that the lack of crypto knowledge is one of the biggest reasons that the public is wary of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In order for people to take crypto to the next level, high-quality crypto education needs to be incorporated into school and college curriculums. Josh Cowell, who is a crypto researcher, also believes that the introduction of such courses can improve one's financial literacy.\n\nIt is also necessary that students be taught about the legal and regulatory implications of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies which play a pivotal role in the understanding of the crypto industry.\n\nCrypto education in India?\n\nAruna Sharma, who is a Practioner Development Economist and Ex-Secretary General, GoI believes that \"crypto has attained a 'Ponzi' phenomenon among people who do not have exposure to what adds value to it and how it contributes to the strengthening and expansion of blockchain. Correct unbiased knowledge is the need of the day and those entrepreneurs who understand well will be able\n\nto use it effectively.\"\n\nAt the moment, there has been no push for crypto or blockchain education in India as the anti-crypto sentiment still prevails.\n\nWith the RBI also pushing for a crypto ban, will India ever get its own blockchain education programme?"

        "content": "When it comes to playing poker with cryptocurrencies, there are several popular digital currencies that have gained recognition and acceptance within the online poker community. These cryptocurrencies offer unique features and advantages that make them attractive options for players. Let\u2019s take a look:\n\n1. Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin is the original and most well-known cryptocurrency and carries the highest value. It is widely accepted in the online poker community and offers secure and anonymous transactions. Bitcoin\u2019s large user base makes it a popular choice for crypto poker players and there are a number of great Bitcoin poker sites to choose from.\n\n2. Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used for transactions within the Ethereum network and is also accepted by many crypto poker sites. Ethereum\u2019s flexibility and programmability open up possibilities for innovative features and game mechanics in crypto poker.\n\n3. Litecoin (LTC)\n\nLitecoin is often considered the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold. It offers faster transaction confirmation times and a different hashing algorithm, making it more accessible for smaller transactions. Many online poker sites accept Litecoin, providing players with a reliable and efficient alternative to Bitcoin.\n\n4. Ripple (XRP)\n\nRipple is a digital payment protocol that facilitates fast, low-cost international money transfers. While not as widely supported in the crypto poker community as Bitcoin or Ethereum, some platforms accept Ripple as a form of payment. Ripple\u2019s focus on facilitating seamless cross-border transactions may appeal to players looking for quick and cost-effective transfers.\n\n5. Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\n\nBitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that emerged as a result of a hard fork from Bitcoin. It offers faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is accepted by select crypto poker sites, providing an alternative for players seeking a balance between transaction efficiency and broader adoption.\n\n6. Cardano (ADA)\n\nCardano is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a secure and sustainable infrastructure for the development of decentralized applications. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is accepted by some crypto poker platforms. Cardano\u2019s focus on scalability and sustainability makes it an interesting choice for players seeking a forward-looking blockchain solution.\n\n7. Dogecoin (DOGE)\n\nOriginally created as a lighthearted cryptocurrency, Dogecoin has gained a significant following and community. While not as widely supported in the crypto poker industry as other cryptocurrencies, some platforms accept Dogecoin as a payment option. Dogecoin\u2019s playful nature and active community may appeal to players looking for a fun and unique poker experience.\n\nPlease note that the availability of cryptocurrencies for poker may vary depending on the platform and region. It\u2019s always advisable to check with the specific online poker site for their supported cryptocurrencies before making a deposit.\n\nWhat To Look For From A Crypto Poker Site\n\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a new crypto poker site, it can be hard to know which of your options is best. There are so many great sites to choose from, that it can be a bit daunting! If you\u2019re not sure where to start, take a look at our list below for some of the most important factors to consider when looking for a new crypto poker site.\n\nCrypto Payment Options \u2013 One of the first things you should look for when checking out a prospective crypto poker site is whether or not they support your chosen cryptocurrency. Some poker rooms support dozens of different cryptocurrencies, whereas some only support a handful of them, so always check before signing up.\n\nGame Selection \u2013 Another thing you should look for is what the traffic is like for your favorite game. If you\u2019re an Omaha-maniac, you\u2019ll want to play on a poker site that has plenty of Omaha games running. However, if you\u2019re more of a Hold\u2019em tournament player, you\u2019ll want to take a look at the MTT schedule before signing up.\n\nBonuses and Promotions \u2013 Everyone\u2019s favorite part of signing up for a new poker room is claiming all the bonuses and promotions they have to offer. Some sites offer huge matched deposit bonuses that really boost your bankroll, so make sure you shop around for the best offers.\n\nSecurity Features \u2013 You\u2019ll want to know that when you sign up for a crypto poker room that your data and your crypto will remain secure on the site. Look for features like SSL encryption and firewall technology to ensure that your details are safe."

        "content": "The crypto assets are enjoying a bullish period in the market right now. Bitcoin [BTC] led the latest rally by crossing the $20,000 mark on Saturday for the first time since November. Alongside, its market cap rose to a high of $413 billion.\n\nJUST IN: #Bitcoin surpasses a $410 billion market cap. January 16, 2023\n\nAt press time, the market cap is currently around $407 billion. The last time BTC entered the $400 billion level was in November 2022. However, the collapse of the FTX exchange and overall bearish sentiments led to a prolonged correction in the charts.\n\nBitcoin wasn\u2019t the only asset whose market cap saw a prominent increase. One of the leading tokens in the charts was Decentraland. MANA rallied by 85% over the past 7-days. On Sunday, Cardano [ADA] took over its counterpart Dogecoin [DOGE] in terms of ranking.\n\nThroughout last week, Cardano pocketed an astounding $2 billion in market cap. This comes after its 15 percent weekly price surge. Dogecoin, on the other hand, managed to pocket only $1.3 billion in its market valuation.\n\nCurrently, Cardano\u2019s market cap sits at $12.40 billion and is the 8th largest crypto. Dogecoin is ranked 9th with a market valuation of $11.50 billion.\n\nSolana\u2019s brief stay in the top ten\n\nA collective bullish market witnessed Solana [SOL] back in action. The asset recorded a 50 percent plus rise over the last couple of days. The market cap of SOL mirrored this notion and drove the altcoin into the coveted top ten.\n\nThroughout the weekend, Solana and Polygon were competing in terms of market cap. SOL took over MATIC as its market cap peaked at over $9 billion. This further prompted the entry of the altcoin into the top ten.\n\nNevertheless, at press time, Polygon\u2019s MATIC is back in the top ten with its market valuation at $8.89 billion. Solana wasn\u2019t too far off as its market cap was noted at $8.64 billion.\n\nHere\u2019s how the overall crypto market cap was impacted\n\nSimilar to the assets mentioned above, a plethora of other cryptocurrencies encountered a prominent rise. This further boosted the overall market value. Back on Saturday, the global crypto market once again hit the trillion-dollar mark.\n\nJUST IN: Global #cryptocurrency market cap reclaims $1 trillion. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) January 14, 2023\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap, the market\u2019s current valuation is at $992.8 billion."

        "content": "Anthony Scaramucci, founder, SkyBridge Capital, explained that Bitcoin will reach $300K in six years\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, founder, SkyBridge Capital, is reportedly financing a crypto company that was established by FTX US\u2019 previous president, as reported by Cointelegraph. Skybridge Capital is \u201cpretty optimistic\u201d about bitcoin and ethereum over the next 12 to 24 months. The global asset management firm\u2019s founder explained that the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin will reach $300K in six years, urging investors to \u201cjust relax\u201d and \u201cstay long-term.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cointelegraph, the unnamed crypto software company aims to support crypto traders to develop algorithmic-oriented strategies. It is believed that the initiative aims to create linkage with centralized and decentralized markets. Reportedly, Brett Harrison, former president, FTX US, has kept a fundraising target worth $10 million for a $100 million valuation. Through a January 14, 2023, tweet, Scaramucci expressed his desire and him being \u201cproud\u201d to invest in Harrison\u2019s new company.\n\nCointelegraph noted that Scaramucci has expressed hopes around crypto market recovery, elaborating 2023\u2019s market outlook as a \u201crecovery year.\u201d \u201cYou are taking on risk but you\u2019re also believing in [Bitcoin] adoption. So, if we get the adoption right, and I believe we will, this could easily be a fifty to one hundred thousand dollar asset over the next two to three years,\u201d Scaramucci said.\n\nBitcoin will reach $300K?\n\nSkybridge\u2019s largest crypto positions are in bitcoin and ethereum, he noted, adding that the firm also likes solana and has \u201ca very large position\u201d on algorand. Sharing his outlook for bitcoin specifically, Scaramucci described \u201cthe improvement of the Lightning network, the increase in applications, and ease of transactions on bitcoin,\u201d noting:\n\nYou are going to see a lot more commercial activities there.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nBefore you decide whether Bitcoin is a good investment or not, you should know that all Bitcoin price predictions are speculative. That said, these predictions are educated guesses because they are based on a mix of fundamental and technical analysis.\n\nMost cryptocurrency market analysts believe that Bitcoin could go up in 2023. The average Bitcoin price prediction for 2023 is $30,000. However, it is more long-term that analysts expect Bitcoin to do well. For instance, analysts expect Bitcoin to trade at $200k or more in 2025.\n\nBitcoin is considered as the digital Gold of modern times. Since 2009, many cryptocurrencies have come into existence to profit off of Bitcoin\u2019s success. There are currently 20,000+ cryptocurrencies in existence, but only a handful of cryptos are popular. However, since day one, Bitcoin is the king of all cryptos.\n\nCryptocurrency\u2019s future outlook is still very much in question. Proponents see the limitless potential, while critics see nothing but risk. Managing the risk is the first thing to think of. All investors who are going to work with cryptocurrency today must understand what the currency is about and have a clear plan of action for all sorts of scenarios.\n\nSo, Is Bitcoin a good investment?\n\nBitcoin being the first-ever successful cryptocurrency, gained traction faster than the rest. This has seen it gain traction, especially at institutional levels. This means it could gain value over time.\n\nAt its core, the value of bitcoin is determined by its inherent scarcity. Like Gold, it is a limited resource: only a finite supply of bitcoin can be mined and traded on the market, which means that its price will likely continue to rise as demand grows. This has made it extremely attractive to investors eager to get in on the increasingly lucrative cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s unique combination of scarcity and utility will keep investors coming back for more. And as long as that demand continues to grow, so will the profits generated by trading this increasingly valuable commodity.\n\nBelow are some of its core use cases to give you a better idea of how good Bitcoin is as an investment.\n\nBitcoin can be used for everyday payments. This is done peer-to-peer, so the payment cannot be controlled by any government.\n\nThanks to its scarcity, Bitcoin could become a store of value, just like Gold.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature makes it perfect as a store-of-value cryptocurrency.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin Rally to Potential $22,500 Soon - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "BTC/USDT 1-Hour Chart (Source: TradingView)\n\nIn continuation of the previous day\u2019s bullish trend in the crypto market, BTC bulls have accelerated their rally in recent hours. The bulls are pulling the price up, and BTC is now hovering at $21,156.88 with a 24-hour increase of 2.08%.\n\nThe RSI of BTC in the 1-hour chart of BTC/USDT is currently 62.20. Sooner it can reach an RSI value above 70, indicating that the crypto king is overbought and the bears will soon gain power, forcing the price into a downtrend. If the price cannot close above the $22,000 level, this might trigger another drop in the near future.\n\nThe above 1-hour chart states that after rising up from the order block between $18848.54 and $18778.32, Bitcoin rose up to the $21,000 price level and now forming higher highs and higher lows inside a rising wedge. A rising wedge is believed to signal an imminent breakout to the downside. Like other wedges, the pattern begins wide towards the bottom and contracts as the price moves higher and the trading range narrows. If Bitcoin follows the nature of the rising wedge, we can expect a price dump back to its previous order block soon.\n\nHowever, there is also another possibility that if more traders are betting on higher prices and accumulating more Bitcoins, the upper trendline of the rising wedge can be broken. In that case, Bitcoin price might trade above $22,500\n\nOverall, the Bollinger Bands are now contracting to mean that the market is in a low liquidity environment. In order to determine whether Bitcoin is now back in a bull market, risk-averse traders may want to keep a watch out for rising trading volume at higher prices.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Bitcoin reached a high of $20.9k on Saturday, leaving short sellers who bet against its ascent in the red.\n\nThe flagship Cryptocurrency has been on the rise all week as recent positive macroeconomic reports breathe life into a largely depressed market.\n\nData from CoinGecko shows that the price of bitcoin hasn\u2019t been this high since early November, just before the stunning collapse of FTX.\n\nThe overall market capitalization of the cryptocurrency sector currently stands at $990 billion, a rise of more than 4% over the previous day, indicating that the market is also showing signs of life.\n\nIn the previous day, cryptocurrency transactions totaled more than $80 billion.\n\nTraditional markets also saw gains for the week, with the S&P 500 rising more than 2% as Q4 earnings season got underway and U.S. inflation numbers\u2014while still elevated\u2014kept falling. The first monthly inflation reduction in 2.5 years as well as more substantial annual declines in both the headline and core readings have added to the optimism.\n\nWhy the rise: Bitcoin prices began its surge earlier in the week in anticipation of the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s December Consumer Price Index report.\n\nMonday marked the beginning of the week\u2019s trading for bitcoin, which has since continued to rise. The CPI report confirmed that inflation in the US economy is really dropping while also meeting market expectations.\n\nBut, none of this ensures that this year will be favorable for risk assets, but it does indicate that things will appear much more normal than they did last year.\n\nEven though the macroeconomic environment may have improved, the outlook for bitcoin businesses is bleak.\n\nMetropolitan Commercial Bank (MCB), a New York-based institution, said on January 9 that it would shut down its crypto-assets sector, citing recent market losses and changes in the legal environment as reasons. 6% of the bank\u2019s total deposits came from customers who were involved in the crypto industry.\n\nWith Bitcoin up 16% since the beginning of 2023, derivatives analytics show little indication of demand from leveraged short sales or defensive put options.\n\nBears are still patiently waiting for an entry point for their short positions, despite the fact that bulls can rejoice that the $900 billion total market capitalization resistance faced no opposition.\n\nStill, Crypto Bulls\u2019 major hope is still a good macroeconomic environment, which is mostly dependent on how U.S retail sales statistics come out next week given the market\u2019s unfavorable newsflow.\n\nMeanwhile, About 12,621 traders were liquidated on that day, totaling $650.99 million in liquidations. The greatest single liquidation order, worth $6.84 million, was placed on Huobi.\n\nWhy Shortsell? The goal of shorting bitcoin is to borrow the asset when the price is high and then sell subsequently.\n\nThey then buy back if the asset falls and return to who they borrowed from.\n\nThe spread is then pocketed as profit by the short seller.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Gemini and cryptocurrency exchange Genesis Global Capital of selling unregistered securities through Gemini\u2019s \u201cEarn\u201d program on January 12.\n\nA new round of staff layoffs announced by Crypto.com on January 13 that resulted in a 20% reduction in the global workforce was the final blow. Kraken, Coinbase, and Huobi are a few other cryptocurrency exchanges that just announced employment losses within the past month."

        "title": "Mining cryptocurrency in S\u2019pore: is it legal and can you actually earn passive income from it? - Vulcan Post",
        "content": "After a year of bleeding for the crypto market, investors are still searching for light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nWith the collapse of companies like FTX and Celsius, consumer trust has taken a major hit. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 which are seen as indicators for the broader market \u2014 remain around 70 per cent off their all-time-highs.\n\nCrypto investments have always been a risky endeavour, but this seems more apparent now than ever before. It begs the question, is there truly a way to make safe returns in this space?\n\nPerhaps, mining cryptocurrencies could offer better returns than investing in them directly. Mining is the process through which transactions are verified on blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. A network of computers \u2014 which anyone can be a part of \u2014 is responsible for ensuring that all transactions which get recorded on these blockchains are legitimate.\n\nIn exchange for this work, crypto miners are rewarded with newly generated cryptocurrency from their respective blockchain.\n\nHow does Bitcoin mining work?\n\nThe goal of mining is to add a new \u2018block\u2019 to a blockchain. Blocks contain a list of transactions and once they\u2019re added to the chain, they become permanent. As it stands, a new block is added to the Bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes and 6.25BTC is rewarded for each one.\n\nMiners compete against each other for the opportunity to add blocks and collect rewards. To do so, they must be the first to solve a complex maths problem.\n\nThis requires an immense amount of processing power and consumes a lot of electricity. As more and more people have become involved in mining, competition has increased and earning rewards is more difficult than ever before.\n\nImage Credits: Dchained\n\nThe rewards for mining each block have also decreased over time. Since 2012, Bitcoin has undergone events known as \u2018halvings\u2019 every four years. Initially, 50BTC used to be rewarded for each block. The reward has been halved at each event to help control the supply of Bitcoin and its inflation rate.\n\nToday, individual miners stand almost no chance to win out and add blocks. Instead, mining pools have emerged where users collate their computing resources and share rewards based on their contribution to the pool.\n\nCrypto mining in Singapore\n\nThere are no laws restricting crypto mining in Singapore. That being said, there may be clauses against it in housing contracts.\n\nIn April 2022, students were made to remove their crypto mining rigs from their dormitories at the National University of Singapore (NUS). The university cited safety concerns due to the excessive heat generated by the rigs.\n\nFor those looking to mine crypto, there are two primary costs to account for: the initial investment in computational hardware, and the recurring electricity costs.\n\nBitmain\u2019s ASIC miners were designed and optimised for crypto mining purposes / Image Credits: The Chain Bulletin\n\nChina-based crypto company Bitmain is among the most renowned producers of ASIC miners \u2014 hardware designed specifically for mining Bitcoin.\n\nTheir products can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to over US$15,000, and the price correlates with the processing power which the ASIC offers.\n\nIn Singapore, the current electricity rates (inclusive of GST) are 31.27 cents per kWh. These are relatively high when compared to other countries around the world.\n\nSince Singapore doesn\u2019t have access to its own source of fuel, the natural gas import costs contribute to the high prices. To put it in perspective, electricity costs in the US \u2014 which takes up a majority share in Bitcoin mining \u2014 can be as low as 11 cents per kWh.\n\nHow much can you earn?\n\nOnline calculators such as NiceHash help gauge the profitability of mining activities, while accounting for hardware and electricity costs. These estimates are based on past performance and aren\u2019t fully representative of future earnings. However, they can be fairly accurate on a short-term basis.\n\nAs it stands \u2014 with Bitcoin prices well in the red \u2014 mining is unlikely to reap profits in Singapore.\n\nUsing the Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro, which is touted to be one of the best options on the market, one could expect to lose S$10.86 per day. GPUs such as the Nvidia RTX 3060 offer better outcomes, but still produce losses up to S$1 per day.\n\nAlong with this, one must also consider the initial cost of their hardware. For example, the Antminer S19j Pro costs around S$3,000 for retail purchase.\n\nNiceHash allows users to input their hardware and electricity rates, and calculates if their mining operation will be profitable / Screenshot of NiceHash\n\nProfitability could change in the future depending on how the crypto market fares, however, there\u2019s no guarantee. As the Bitcoin price recovers, more miners might be incentivised to join the pool. The increased competition could counteract any of the resulting benefits.\n\nMoney aside, there\u2019s also an environmental aspect to consider. Bitcoin mining contributes heavily to greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, the energy used by the Bitcoin blockchain could power entire nations such as Belgium and the Philippines.\n\nAll things considered, Bitcoin mining \u2013 as convenient as it sounds \u2014 remains unprofitable in Singapore at this point of time. Unless you have someone else bearing the electricity costs, that is.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Reuters"

        "content": "Text-based artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT has gained prominence for its ability to handle a wide range of tasks with high accuracy. One area where the tool can be leveraged is in trading by offering possible price movements of different assets in the market.\n\nIn this regard, Finbold asked ChatGPT to share Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) possible price by 2030 based on various metrics, such as traditional price movement, technical analysis, and other relevant metrics.\n\nInterestingly, the tool acknowledged that it is challenging to predict the price of Bitcoin in the long run, citing the high market volatility and regulations. However, the AI-powered platform notes that there remains room for Bitcoin to rise in the coming years, citing the maturing markets and increased adoption.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to predict the price of Bitcoin in 2030 with any degree of accuracy. The price of Bitcoin is highly volatile and is subject to many external factors, such as government regulations, economic conditions, and technological advancements. <\u2026> As the cryptocurrency market matures and more people become aware of the potential of digital currencies, Bitcoin will likely become more widely accepted, and its value will continue to rise,\u201d said ChatGPT.\n\nNotably, the projection by ChatGPT aligns with a prediction of Bitcoin proponents who believe that the asset is on its way to mainstream adoption.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s potential\n\nAlthough the tool remains in its experimental stages, initial projections indicate that it could be leveraged to automate repetitive tasks such as monitoring prices and trading on specific conditions, among others. Furthermore, ChatGPT can help traders make informed decisions by being trained to generate reports on market trends, prices, and other relevant data.\n\nIt is worth noting that ChatGPT\u2019s current knowledge is limited as it needs more information on global happenings beyond 2021.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $20,925, having recorded gains of about 0.3% in the last 24 hours.

The possibility of the Federal Reserve slowing down on interest rate hikes has helped Bitcoin and the general market put the bruising 2022 behind.\n\nThe outlook is also driving optimism in the sector regarding the possible entry of more investors led by institutions.
