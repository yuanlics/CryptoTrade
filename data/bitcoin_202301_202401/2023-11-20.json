        "content": "A runoff election in Argentina, Sunday, resulted in a win for Javier Milei, a libertarian on the political right who wants to dollarize the country\u2019s economy and has expressed support for Bitcoin.\n\nMilei won about 56% of the vote versus just over 44% in the runoff, in Latin America\u2019s third most populous nation.\n\nIn a country which has recently witnessed triple-digit rates of inflation, Milei sees bitcoin and digital currencies as an effort to \u201creturn money to its original creator: the private sector.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nEmphasizing Bitcoin\u2019s finite supply, he regards it as a more secure alternative to traditional mediums like gold or silver\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nMilei, known for his anti-central banking stance, has criticized the central bank for \u201ccheating good people\u201d through inflationary tax. He claimed that he would \u201cblow it up,\u201d calling it a scam, even releasing a cinematic political ad in 2021 while running for a seat in parliament, in which he\u2019s seen destroying a model representing the central bank with a Thor-like hammer.\n\nLoading Tweet.. The ad, surfaced recently, was produced in 2021.\n\nHis criticism is particularly poignant given Argentina\u2019s high inflation rates, which reached 135% in 2023\u200b\u200b. The peso has fallen in value, resulting in all-time highs for bitcoin (BTC), currently about ARS 13.2 million per BTC.\n\nMilei has been involved in controversies, including being sued for allegedly promoting a Ponzi scheme called Coinx in Argentina. He denied any misconduct, comparing the company\u2019s actions to those of a typical bank\u200b\u200b.\n\nDespite his support for cryptocurrencies, Milei has not proposed making bitcoin legal tender in Argentina, as it is in El Salvador. Instead, he has called for dollarizing the Argentine economy, as a way of dealing with the country\u2019s rampant inflation\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b problem.\n\nWhile Milei\u2019s views on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies reflect a strong preference for private sector-controlled money, and a skepticism towards central banking, it\u2019s unclear what a Milei administration will mean in practice when it comes to integrating crypto into national economic policies.\n\nUpdated November 20, 2023 at 8:35 am ET, clarifying Milei\u2019s anti-central bank political ad was from 2021.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Key Takeaways Economist Javier Milei will become the new president of Argentina after defeating Sergio Massa.\n\nMilei has made positive statements regarding bitcoin in the past, and he has also called for the abolishment of the Central Bank of Argentina.\n\nMilei has not outlined any specific policies regarding Bitcoin, but the dollarization of Argentina was a core tenet of his presidential campaign.\n\nBitcoin has become increasingly relevant in political campaigns around the world in recent years.\n\nOn Sunday, the Libertarian Party's Javier Milei was elected as the new president of Argentina. Milei has spoken positively about bitcoin in the past, and the price of the crypto asset rose to roughly $37,500 as Milei's opponent in the runoff election conceded defeat.\n\nMilei Has Embraced Bitcoin But Has No Policy Outlined\n\nLibertarian Javier Milei defeated fellow contender Sergio Massa in the runoff election for the president of Argentina on Sunday, with Milei receiving nearly 56% of the final vote tally.\n\nThe election result was viewed positively by bitcoin proponents around the world, as Milei has spoken supportively about the crypto asset in the past. Earlier this year, Milei referred to bitcoin as a representation of the \"return of money to its original creator, the private sector.\"\n\nMilei has already drawn comparisons to the heavily pro-bitcoin president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, who declared bitcoin legal tender in his country. However, the new president-elect of Argentina has not yet outlined a specific bitcoin policy for the country.\n\nThat said, Milei has promised to close the Central Bank of Argentina and embrace the dollarization of the Argentine economy. Argentina has a long history of difficulties with inflation, and the country has recently been struggling with an inflation rate of more than 100%.\n\n\"Ultimately, Grayscale Research views this as a meaningful step forward for crypto adoption, as bitcoin moves closer toward fulfilling its role as a super-sovereign means of exchange to accelerate a more accessible and inclusive financial system,\" wrote crypto asset manager Grayscale's Matt Maximo regarding the potential impact of Milei's victory.\n\nBitcoin Gathering Political Currency\n\nMilei is yet another example of bitcoin becoming a larger talking point in the global political landscape.\n\nIn the United States, independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made his first official appearance as a presidential candidate at a bitcoin conference earlier this year. Additionally, the current mayors of both New York City and Miami have talked about turning their respective cities into crypto hubs.\n\nThat said, there are also opponents of crypto in the U.S., most notably Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has embraced the idea of building an \"anti-crypto army\" in Washington.\n\nIn the past, Venezuela, which has been dealing with much worse levels of inflation than Argentina, attempted to create its own crypto token. However, Venezuela's crypto project, known as the Petro, was largely centralized, working much differently from bitcoin and failed in achieving what it set out to do."

        "content": "Bitcoin jumped nearly 3% after a pro-crypto candidate from the far right handily defeated Argentina\u2019s current economic minister in the country\u2019s presidential election.\n\nBitcoin broke through the $37,000 mark, and was still up 2% over the past 24 hours, after Javier Milei, a populist figure who labels himself an anarcho-capitalist and libertarian, was named the winner. Milei has found an audience in Argentina\u2014and among the crypto faithful\u2014in part for his radical economic proposals such as eliminating the country\u2019s central bank.\n\nMilei is friendly to cryptocurrencies, especially the most popular token, Bitcoin. In an interview with the Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn he raged against central banks and politicians, adding that Bitcoin was the natural reaction against \u201cthe scam that is central banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Bitcoin is representing is the return of money to its original creator, which is the private sector,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 53-year-old economist may be friendly to Bitcoin but he doesn\u2019t support making it legal tender as did El Salvador President Nayib Bukele in 2021. Milei has said he plans to dollarize Argentina\u2019s economy in a bid to fight the more than 140% inflation that the South American country is facing.\n\nStill, some notable crypto figures have congratulated the president-elect, including MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor and Arthur Hayes, the cofounder of crypto exchange BitMEX.\n\nWhile Milei\u2019s libertarian views on the economy have proved popular among Argentinians, the politician\u2019s radical stances on other issues have alienated others. Milei has actively opposed sex education and feminist causes, and he\u2019s said that humans are not the cause of global climate change, contradicting a nearly unanimous scientific consensus."

The initial report came from the Wall Street Journal, which said Zhao would soon step down as CEO of the exchange and plead guilty to violating U.S. anti-money-laundering laws. Court documents have since confirmed this.\n\nBinance will also plead guilty to a criminal charge and pay $4.3 billion in fines, which will allow it to settle civil charges brought against it by regulators. Zhao himself will pay $50 million.\n\nAs BNB fell, so did the broader crypto market, with the global cryptocurrency market cap dropping 3.5% over the past day to $1.43 trillion, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, fell just under 2% following news of the charges against Zhao and Binance.\n\nBinance initially sold millions of BNB in 2019, and currently allows customers to use the tokens for a discount on trading. The company and Zhao still hold billions of dollars worth of the coin.\n\nThe Justice Department is scheduled to hold a press conference at 3 p.m. Eastern Time on the criminal charges. The lawsuit follows previous lawsuits by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission."

        "content": "Bitcoin block space looks set to be the hottest commodity in crypto.\n\nBitcoin once again occupies more than half the entire crypto market, having outperformed ether by nearly double so far in 2023. Now, the long-prophesied \u201cflippening\u201d of ether over bitcoin is even further in the future.\n\nThe market currently values Bitcoin three times higher than Ethereum. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap, at $727 billion, has swelled by $400 billion in 2023 \u2014 a figure bigger than Mastercard\u2019s entire stock valuation and about twice that of Netflix\u2019s.\n\nEthereum\u2019s valuation has grown by $100 billion, jumping from under $145 billion in January to nearly $245 billion today.\n\nSome anticipate that Ethereum\u2019s market cap will one day eclipse Bitcoin\u2019s, despite the latter\u2019s half-decade head start.\n\nThings were looking good coming out of the 2019 bear market and into 2021\u2019s explosive bull cycle. DeFi summer and NFT mania boosted interest in Ethereum, at times driving up fees for certain actions beyond $250.\n\nBitcoin\u2018s market value was 925% of Ethereum\u2019s \u2014 $130 billion to $14 billion \u2014 at the end of 2019 (bottom of the bear market).\n\nThat figure had shrunk to under 200% by the end of 2021 (peak bull market).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market value is now 300% of Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nThe Bitcoin rally has widened the gap\n\nThe case for flippening has recently taken a hit by a different flip: The Bitcoin network now rakes in more fees than Ethereum for the first time since December 2020.\n\nOver the past four days, Bitcoin users have paid miners about $40 million to have their transactions processed.\n\nEthereum users, meanwhile, forked out less than $27 million ether (most of those fees have been burned, slightly reducing Ethereum\u2019s overall supply).\n\nLayer-2 Ethereum networks Arbitrum and Optimism haven\u2019t bridged that gap as they each generate less than $200,000 in fees per day right now.\n\nThe fee-flippening (flee-pening?) is awkward when you consider the sheer amount of use cases supported by Ethereum. Decentralized exchanges, DAOs, memecoins, NFTs, stablecoins, DeFi and GameFi all run atop Ethereum.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Justin Drake is unconcerned despite ether\u2019s middling year pricewise: Q&A\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, had for the longest time mostly had one application \u2014 bitcoin transactions. But the rate of on-chain transactions had until recently sustained very little growth since 2015. Perhaps due to its \u201cdigital gold\u201d narrative and the rising ubiquity of alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nOver the past five years, Ethereum users have paid $17 billion in fees, Bitcoin users just $2.9 billion\n\nAll that changed with Ordinals \u2014 a protocol for inscribing individual units of bitcoin (BTC) with unique data to create digital collectibles, first launched in January.\n\nMusic, text, art, video and even code for browser-based DOOM clones have since been inscribed to Bitcoin, resulting in an on-chain collectibles market worth thousands of BTC. Bitcoin users trade Ordinals as Ethereum or Solana users would trade NFTs.\n\nToday, anywhere from around a third to one half of Bitcoin transactions contain Ordinals, driving up demand for blockspace as well as transaction fees. At times today, \u201cmedium priority\u201d transactions went for around $11 compared to around $2.30 for the same on Ethereum (more priority generally means faster processing), although those prices have since come down.\n\nTron comes in third overall for monthly fees, mostly thanks to stablecoin Tether\n\nSo is Bitcoin netting more fees than Ethereum good for Bitcoin? Maybe not.\n\nSome Bitcoin insiders worry the network isn\u2019t properly equipped to handle Ordinals and potential influxes of interest in its original use case, BTC payments.\n\nThe CryptoKitties incident in December 2017 \u2014 during which a NFT game grew so popular that it spectacularly clogged Ethereum \u2014 first showed that Ethereum probably couldn\u2019t handle serving as the \u201cWorld Computer\u201d just yet.\n\nThen, the 2021 bull market saw NFT mint costs soar to $250 at times \u2014 a reminder of how necessary it was to port activity to smaller chains, including rollups. Still, memecoins and low quality token projects ratcheted up fees beyond $20 earlier this year, drastically reducing Ethereum\u2019s usefulness for non-critical tasks.\n\nThe NFT craze of 2021 made Ethereum block space the hottest commodity in crypto. Even while tanking its utility.\n\nOrdinals may end up having the same effect on Bitcoin, especially if demand keeps up and the bull market truly hits.\n\nAt that point, it would seem reasonable to value Bitcoin and Ethereum more similarly. It might just take another run.\n\nUpdated Nov. 16, 2023 at 4:25 pm ET: Corrected reference to percentages in bullet points.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "The curious case of FTX and bitcoin's surge - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of fraud-ridden cryptocurrency exchange FTX, presented himself as an altruistic, unkempt genius who found himself unwittingly out of his depth. The jury, however, decided that he was a fraudster who knowingly stole $8 billion of customers\u2019 money. Another example that all that glitters in crypto land is not gold? A blockchain lover\u2019s Barbieland detached from the real world?\n\nWhatever your stance, crypto now has its own Jordan Belfort, and Bankman-Fried faces years behind bars. Ironically, as the 31-year-old awaits sentencing, bitcoin is on a tear. Its price has doubled, surging back above $37,000, while trading volume went gangbusters. But away from the courtroom drama, the reasons for this tidal shift are more prosaic, with the U.S. rumored to be on the cusp of having spot-price bitcoin ETFs approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThis is arguably the biggest thing to happen to bitcoin since the mythical Satoshi Nakamoto invented it in 2008. Many clients will, therefore, see the legitimization provided by the new ETFs as a reason to ask their advisors why they aren\u2019t benefiting from the price increase.\n\nOn the surface, there are compelling arguments for the nascent asset class \u2014 its increasing lack of correlation to major markets establishes it as an alternative to gold, and the pending regulatory approval indicates that the data and structure are sound. But as InvestmentNews\u2019 Emile Hallez reports in this issue, most advisors don\u2019t have exposure. In short, they don\u2019t trust bitcoin or, whisper it, don\u2019t understand it. Given the cryptocurrency\u2019s short history and wild price swings, few advisors are willing to recommend an investment for which they can\u2019t predict or measure risk.\n\nAdvisors are, of course, paid to steer clients away from unsuitable investments, and bitcoin\u2019s volatility remains a huge turnoff for long-term financial planning. But doing so without a deep understanding of what you\u2019re rejecting won\u2019t be enough for bullish clients. Further education to get ahead of what could be another crypto wave looks like a smart play.\n\nThe new ETFs, at the very least, will make a small allocation of \u201cplay money\u201d in portfolios more palatable. Perversely, the fall of FTX may embolden some investors who view its collapse as some sort of nadir for crypto. \u201cThat can\u2019t happen again, right?\u201d\n\nBut for advisors, the SEC approval will be what matters and there is little doubt that bitcoin is inching toward more widespread legitimacy. Advisors, even deeply cynical ones, should be prepared for clients\u2019 crypto questions."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price action shows consolidation and significant volatility, focusing on the $38,000 resistance level and market sentiment indicators. How high can Bitcoin go?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has shown resilience and bounced back above $37k levels after declining to $35k levels on Nov. 15.\n\nBTC has maintained its bullish outlook despite a period of sliding prices influenced by the absence of significant developments in the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and other macroeconomic factors.\n\nMoreover, over the past few weeks, Bitcoin\u2019s journey has been marked by a pattern of higher lows and higher highs, a characteristic of a bull phase in the crypto market.\n\nGreg Moritz of AltTab Capital remarks on the natural occurrence of pullbacks even in bullish markets, suggesting that the current scenario is a typical fluctuation within an overall positive trend\u200b\u200b.\n\nFurther bolstering Bitcoin\u2019s position is the macroeconomic landscape, which presents interesting dynamics for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s policy adjustments in response to economic indicators and endorsements by financial institutions like BlackRock have contributed to a resurgence in crypto, reflecting a cautiously optimistic market sentiment\u200b\u200b.\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s current state within a rapidly evolving financial ecosystem, let\u2019s see what factors are affecting BTC price and what\u2019s the Bitcoin price prediction for the coming days.\n\nUpdated status and market expectations for spot BTC ETF\n\nThe SEC\u2019s cautious stance on the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs remains evident, as seen by the fact that, to date, no applications for these ETFs, including a notable submission from Global X, have been approved.\n\nThis consistent hesitance from the regulatory body has effectively narrowed the window for approving multiple ETFs, pushing the potential for a first spot Bitcoin ETF approval into 2024.\n\nAttention is now turning towards the Jan. 10, 2024, deadline for the ARK 21Shares application, which stands as a significant date for investors and analysts monitoring the situation.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ongoing reluctance to approve spot BTC ETFs, even amidst growing interest in integrating cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial sector, underscores the enduring regulatory hurdles within the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin price action and technical analysis\n\nAs of Nov. 21, Bitcoin\u2019s price action has been fluctuating around the $37,000 mark, displaying the challenges it faces in reclaiming higher ground as a stable support level\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is well below Bitcoin\u2019s current price at about $36,900, indicating a bullish state in the market. Bitcoin\u2019s price movement is currently confined within a sideways channel, fluctuating between $36k and $38k level.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin bulls and bears are engaged in a tug of war near the $36,400 support/resistance level, which has become a critical midpoint of the trading range for BTC. This pattern emerged after Bitcoin first spiked to $38,000 on Nov. 9, indicating a consolidation phase in its price movement\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe market also witnessed significant volatility, with a noticeable drop to the $34,750 level, signaling a cooling trend. However, a strong rally was observed on Nov. 16, with Bitcoin surging to a high of $38,000, mirroring its peak. This repeated peak forms a double top, suggesting $38,000 as a strong resistance level\u200b\u200b.\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto fear and greed index is currently at 74 out of 100 points, indicating an elevated level of optimism within the cryptocurrency sector. The index experienced a drop from a weekly high of 77 achieved on Nov. 16, which denoted even more greed.\n\nThe fear and greed index is a crucial indicator of market sentiment, often used to gauge the emotional state of the crypto markets\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price prediction\n\nDigitalCoinPrice anticipates an optimistic Bitcoin price forecast for the coming years. Their BTC forecast for 2023 suggests a significant rise in Bitcoin\u2019s value, estimating it to reach around $74,086.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, the BTC price prediction by DigitalCoinPrice becomes even more promising, with an expectation of Bitcoin\u2019s price climbing to approximately $90,228.\n\nOn the other hand, CoinCodex offers a near-term Bitcoin price prediction that is a bit more conservative.\n\nAs per their forecast, by Nov. 29, Bitcoin is anticipated to be valued at about $54,343. This BTC price prediction, while lower than DigitalCoinPrice\u2019s, still reflects a positive outlook for Bitcoin in the short term.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to approach these Bitcoin price predictions with caution, keeping in mind the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRemember, investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin should always be done judiciously, never exceeding what one can afford to lose.\n\nRead more: Why Bitcoin price predictions often miss the mark\n\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin And Austrian Economics: Insights From Tuur Demeester - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Austrian Economics have been subjects of much interest and discussion in recent years. In this article, we will explore the basics of Bitcoin, delve into the principles of Austrian Economics, and examine the unique insights provided by Tuur Demeester, a renowned expert in both fields.\n\nThe Role of Bitcoin in Today's Economy\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin has become a store of value for many individuals who see it as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Its decentralized nature and limited supply have led some to view it as digital gold, a safe haven asset in times of economic uncertainty. This perception has been further reinforced by institutional investors and corporations, such as MicroStrategy and Tesla, allocating a portion of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin.\n\nIt is important to note that Bitcoin's impact extends beyond its monetary value. The underlying principles of decentralization, transparency, and censorship resistance have inspired a broader movement for financial sovereignty and individual empowerment. Bitcoin has become a symbol of resistance against centralized authorities and a catalyst for reimagining the future of money.\n\nThe Principles of Austrian Economics\n\nLet us turn our attention to the principles of Austrian Economics. Austrian Economics is a school of economic thought that emphasizes individual freedom, free markets, and limited government intervention. Its origins can be traced back to the works of economists such as Carl Menger, Friedrich Hayek, Murray Rothbard, and Ludwig von Mises.\n\nThe Origin and Evolution of Austrian Economics\n\nAustrian Economics emerged as a reaction to the prevailing economic theories of the time, which focused on mathematical models and central planning. Its proponents argued that economics should be grounded in the study of individuals' actions and choices, rather than abstract aggregates. Over the years, Austrian Economics has evolved and gained prominence, attracting a dedicated following of scholars and practitioners.\n\nKey Tenets of Austrian Economics\n\nAustrian Economics is characterized by several key principles. Firstly, it emphasizes the subjective nature of value, arguing that value is determined by individuals' preferences and choices. Secondly, it highlights the importance of entrepreneurship and market competition in driving economic growth and innovation.\n\nFurthermore, Austrian Economics emphasizes the role of the price mechanism in coordinating economic activity. Prices, according to Austrian economists, communicate crucial information about scarcity and consumer preferences. Finally, Austrian Economics advocates for sound money and opposes inflationary monetary policies.\n\nTuur Demeester: A Brief Introduction\n\nDemeester's Background and Influence\n\nTuur Demeester is an economist and investor who has extensively studied Bitcoin and Austrian Economics. He is the founder of Adamant Capital, an investment firm specializing in Bitcoin research. Demeester's research and analysis have contributed significantly to the understanding of Bitcoin's economic implications and its relation to Austrian Economics.\n\nDemeester's Views on Bitcoin and Austrian Economics\n\nDemeester has highlighted the compatibility between Bitcoin and Austrian Economics. He argues that Bitcoin's decentralized and permissionless nature aligns with the principles of Austrian Economics, which emphasize individual freedom and free markets. Demeester sees Bitcoin as a potential disruptor to traditional financial systems and believes it can empower individuals by providing them with financial sovereignty.\n\nThe Intersection of Bitcoin and Austrian Economics\n\nDemeester's Perspective on Bitcoin as a Free Market\n\nDemeester sees Bitcoin as a manifestation of the free market principles advocated by Austrian Economics. The absence of a centralized authority controlling Bitcoin's issuance and transaction validation aligns with the Austrian belief in spontaneous order and voluntary exchanges. Bitcoin's open-source nature allows anyone to participate and contribute, making it a truly decentralized ecosystem.\n\nThe Role of Bitcoin in Austrian Economic Theory\n\nBitcoin's emergence has sparked debates within the Austrian Economics community. Some argue that Bitcoin represents a digital form of Austrian economics in practice, as it operates outside the control of central banks and governments. Others contend that Bitcoin's lack of intrinsic value and its volatility make it an unsuitable representation of Austrian economic principles.\n\nCriticisms and Counter Arguments\n\nAs with any subject of interest, Bitcoin and Austrian Economics have not been immune to criticisms. Let us examine some common criticisms and explore Demeester's responses.\n\nCommon Criticisms of Bitcoin in Austrian Economics\n\nOne common criticism argues that Bitcoin's price volatility renders it unreliable as a medium of exchange. Critics claim that the constant fluctuation in value undermines its suitability as a store of value and a unit of account. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining and its potential energy consumption.\n\nDemeester's Responses to Criticisms\n\nDemeester acknowledges the valid concerns raised regarding Bitcoin's volatility and energy consumption. However, he argues that as Bitcoin matures, its volatility is likely to decrease, making it more suitable for everyday transactions. Furthermore, Demeester highlights the growing adoption of renewable energy sources in Bitcoin mining, mitigating the environmental impact.\n\nIn conclusion, the insights provided by Tuur Demeester shed light on the fascinating intersection of Bitcoin and Austrian Economics. Bitcoin's unique attributes align with the principles of Austrian Economics, opening the door to discussions about the future of money and the role of decentralized systems in our economic landscape.\n\nWeekly Recap (11/13/2023 - 11/17/2023)\n\nGermany\u2019s fourth largest bank Commerzbank granted Bitcoin and Crypto Custody license\n\nU.S. Presidential Candidate Vivek Ramaswamy: \u2018The Government is threatened by Bitcoin\u2019. During an interview on Natalie Brunell\u2019s CoinStories podcast Ramaswamy asserted that the government perceives Bitcoin as a potential threat to its control over monetary policy.\n\nBtcoin\u2019s price rose 120% since El Salvador became the first nation to buy 1 bitcoin a day. One year ago today (11/16/2023), El Salvador announced an ambitious plan to begin adding 1 Bitcoin per day to its national treasury.\n\nGrayscale CEO says \u2018They\u2019re ready for the main event\u2019, awaiting Spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Bitcoin is up 122% year-to-date on the speculation of the first spot ETF approval in the United States.\n\nHong Kong based Boyaa plans to buy $45 Million worth of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "3 Reasons Bitcoin's Momentum is just Beginning - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Whether it be a game of pool, a \u201c2-minute drill\u201d for a football team, or the stock market, momentum can play an integral role in technical and fundamental outcomes. On Wall Street, one can trace the heart of price trends to fundamental momentum. For stocks, this usually means increasing earnings expectations, leading to more investor interest. For other assets, it can mean scarcity and a better use case. Either way, all price trends are birthed when buying pressure outweighs selling pressure and momentum picks up. Bitcoin, which is up ~125% year-to-date and is the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, is one such asset class gaining momentum. Below are three reasons the Bitcoin momentum may just be beginning:\n\nInternational Adoption & Real-World Use is on the Rise\n\nLast night, hyperinflation-plagued Argentina shocked the world by electing a wild-haired, chainsaw-wielding Libertarian candidate named Javier Milei. After embracing socialism for years, an inflation rate of more than 100% a year pushed citizens of South America\u2019s second-largest economy to move in a completely different direction and try something new politically. Years of money printing, currency devaluation, and corruption have collectively brought the country to a tipping point, disrupting the delicate balance between money supply and economic output. Investors cheered the news and sent domestic juggernauts like oil juggernaut YPF (YPF) higher by ~34% and the MSCI Argentina ETF (ARGT) higher by more than 10% in volume which tracked 9,800% above average in early trading.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nAs is the case throughout history, crisis tends to lead to opportunity for investors. In the case of Argentina, the real opportunity may be in Bitcoin. Because Argentina is in such financial trouble, the economic picture remains muddled regardless of who\u2019s in office. However, the election results are bullish for Bitcoin for two main reasons. First, Milei is the second pro-Bitcoin presidential candidate in Latin America to gain office (El Salvador\u2019s Nayib Bukele was the first).\n\nStory continues\n\nBetween the two shocking election outcomes and a wave of US politicians embracing Bitcoin, the momentum is shifting politically on a grand scale. Second, and most importantly, Bitcoin is being used in the real world to stave off inflation. The evidence? Following the election news, Bitcoin hit new highs in three inflation-plagued countries, including Nigeria, Turkey, and, of course, Argentina. The evidence is clear: world citizens are gravitating toward Bitcoin because of its inflation-resistant protocol (there will only ever be 21 million coins, while countries around the world print money endlessly). Year-to-date, Bitcoin is up a robust 351% versus the Argentine Peso.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin Supply is Stagnant\n\nOver the weekend, Bitcoin analyst Will Clemente pointed out that \u201c88% of Bitcoin supply hasn\u2019t moved in at least three months.\u201d In other words, many investors seem to be shifting to a long-term mindset. Because Bitcoin has a fixed supply, as the remaining supply wanes and investor demand increases, Bitcoin should rally further.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Glassnode, Will Clemente\n\nInstitutional Appetite\n\nLong-awaited approval of ETFs will likely mean a quantum leap for the Bitcoin asset class. With juggernauts such as Fidelity and BlackRock (BLK) applying for ETFs, demand will soar from both institutions and retail investors should the ETFs be approved (they likely will be). In the meantime, Bitcoin proxies such as the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO), Coinbase (COIN), and MicroStrategy (MSTR) should benefit dramatically.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "What do you make of these application delays? Are we going to see an approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF next year? Maybe I wouldn't, I would not put bet on uh on January of next year. And these delays I think are symptomatic of the general product that is being offered. So there, the SEC is delaying a whole host of them post the grey scale decision. We shouldn't be surprised that they're not going to go through until they're comfortable with all of them. Uh I mean, you know, before I deleted Twitter, of course, you had a lot of people on there that were saying things like, well, if it, if Blackrock and Fidelity are on it, then this is gonna happen because they have all this money and, and they know how to do things and they can tell the sec what to do because that's how the world works and you don't know anything, please. Um So tell me, I, I, is that actually a legitimate argument that all of us silly people who think that that regulators at the end of the day do have some amount of power over even the largest asset managers can say, look, we, we just don't want this out there and, and do you think that that's something they will do? It's, I think it's less that they just don't want it out there as much as we saw in the gray scale decision. What they want to continue to avoid. Right. They don't want to have any more losses. They suffered a huge loss on the arbitrary and capricious decision. They don't want to also suffer a loss in some of the other things that the court has suggested that they might lose on. And so one other thing that they are probably keeping in mind is how much these spot ETF S are going to probably change the investing market. We know, for example, that right now financial advisors aren't really advising people to diversify into Bitcoin. These are retail investors. Right. They're like maybe 12% but certainly that would go up to 77%. And I think that's what the SEC is taking a look at is that once they're comfortable with all, we'll probably see them say yes to all. But at the same time until they're comfortable with all, we're not going to see some sort of trickle effect of one after another. Slowly."

On November 20, Bitcoin's average daily transaction fee reached $10.34, while Ethereum's average fee stood at $8.43.\n\nThe upswing in Bitcoin transaction fees is a result of heightened activity surrounding the Ordinals Protocol, which enables the creation of NFT-like assets and BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin network. After a period of relative dormancy in late September to October, Ordinals-based assets experienced a significant surge in late October, according to Dune Analytics.\n\nSince October 24, over 6 million Ordinal assets have been generated, leading to the redistribution of more than 800 BTC in fees (equivalent to $30 million) to the network. The momentum further escalated when ORDI, the second-largest BRC-20 token by market capitalization, was listed on Binance on November 7. This listing sparked increased buying activity of BRC-20 tokens, resulting in a price surge of slightly over 50% for the ORDI token.\n\nIn addition to the growing popularity of the Ordinals Protocol, the Taproot Wizards project, which is built on the Ordinals protocol, announced a seed funding round of $7.5 million on November 17.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining involves people using computers or specialised mining hardware to participate in bitcoin\u2019s blockchain network as a transaction processor and validator. Bitcoin uses a system known as proof-of-work (PoW) to validate transaction information.\n\nBitcoin sets itself apart from conventional currencies managed by central banks through its fixed supply mechanism. Specifically, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence, and at present, slightly fewer than 2 million are left to be mined. Roughly 90% of Bitcoin\u2019s entire supply has already been mined, with an estimated 900 being mined per day. This limited availability is maintained through a process called \"halving\u201d, strategically crafted to control inflation and progressively enhance its value.\n\nAs of today, network participants verifying transactions receive a reward of 6.25 bitcoins for successfully mining each block. However, the policy ingrained into its mining algorithm dictates a reduction of roughly half every four years, resulting in the reward falling to 3.125 in the next cycle.\n\nThe first bitcoin halving occurred in November 2012 and experts predict that the next halving will occur in April 2024.\n\nThe reward for mining each block:"

        "content": "Bitcoin wallets created between 2011 and 2015 are susceptible to a new kind of exploit called Randstorm that makes it possible to recover passwords and gain unauthorized access to a multitude of wallets spanning several blockchain platforms.\n\n\"Randstorm() is a term we coined to describe a collection of bugs, design decisions, and API changes that, when brought in contact with each other, combine to dramatically reduce the quality of random numbers produced by web browsers of a certain era (2011-2015),\" Unciphered disclosed in a report published last week.\n\nIt's estimated that approximately 1.4 million bitcoins are parked in wallets that were generated with potentially weak cryptographic keys. Customers can check whether their wallets are vulnerable at www.keybleed[.]com.\n\nThe cryptocurrency recovery company said it re-discovered the problem in January 2022 while it was working for an unnamed customer who had been locked out of its Blockchain.com wallet. The issue was first highlighted way back in 2018 by a security researcher who goes by the alias \"ketamine.\"\n\nThe crux of the vulnerability stems from the use of BitcoinJS, an open-source JavaScript package used for developing browser-based cryptocurrency wallet applications.\n\nEspecially, Randstorm is rooted in the package's reliance on the SecureRandom() function in the JSBN javascript library coupled with cryptographic weaknesses that existed at that time in the web browsers' implementation of the Math.random() function, which allowed for weak pseudorandom number generation. BitcoinJS maintainers discontinued the use of JSBN in March 2014.\n\nAs a result, the lack of enough entropy could be exploited to stage brute-force attacks and recover the wallet private keys generated with the BitcoinJS library (or its dependent projects). The easiest wallets to crack open were those that had been generated before March 2012.\n\nThe findings once again cast fresh light on the open-source dependencies powering software infrastructure and how vulnerabilities in such foundational libraries can have cascading supply chain risks, as previously laid bare in the case of Apache Log4j in late 2021.\n\n\"The flaw was already built into wallets created with the software, and it would stay there forever unless the funds were moved to a new wallet created with new software,\" Unciphered noted."

The ETF would trade on the BZX Exchange by the Chicago Board Options Exchange under the ticker ARKB.\n\nA slew of firms have recently added updates to their spot bitcoin ETF filings, including WisdomTree Investments on Nov. 16, indicating that conversations with the Securities and Exchange Commission are moving along toward a potential approval..

However, the company announced on Monday that it had adjusted its direction based on feedback received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe revised plan, approved by a U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan on November 9, allowed Celsius to return cryptocurrency to its customers and establish a new company owned by Celsius creditors. However, the SEC did not explicitly state during the bankruptcy proceedings whether the new company's business plans would violate U.S. regulations.\n\nThis strategic shift has led to further negotiations with Fahrenheit, a consortium of bidders chosen to oversee the reorganized company. Celsius plans to seek court approval for a modified bankruptcy plan in the near future.\n\nCelsius anticipates that the reduced scope of the new company will lead to reduced management fees and enable a larger amount of cryptocurrency to be directly returned to customers starting in January 2024.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

Instead, they actively seek opportunities where there is a mismatch between energy generation and demand. For instance, collaborations with hydro plants that generate surplus electricity have become common. This shift has led to a mutually beneficial relationship between energy producers and Bitcoin miners.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin mining tools have advanced, with the introduction of hydro-cooling and immersion-cooling technologies replacing the traditional air-cooled rigs. These innovations offer advantages such as reduced noise, minimal maintenance requirements, and increased potential for overclocking, resulting in improved mining efficiency.\n\nAs the fourth Bitcoin halving event approaches in April, some miners express concerns over the potential impact on their revenues.\n\nIn response to these challenges, Marathon Digital is actively pursuing cost-effective electricity solutions, developing proprietary technology, and exploring alternative revenue streams. The company's objective is to achieve high fleet efficiency, and it has formed partnerships with Abu Dhabi and Paraguay to leverage their energy generation gaps.\n\nMarathon Digital's recent project in Utah serves as an example of environmentally friendly and economically viable mining practices. By harnessing methane flare gas emitted from landfills, the company actively combats air pollution while simultaneously generating energy for mining purposes.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

The rally stalled in August as investors failed to get a clear picture of the Federal Reserve\u2019s next course of action with interest rate hikes.\n\nHigher interest rates typically exert a negative impact on growth-oriented sectors, including technology, consumer discretionary industries, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, investors\u2019 mood has perked up once again as they expect the Fed to soon end its monetary tightening campaign as inflation has been declining sharply over the past few months.\n\nOur Picks\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market.

        "content": "Average daily transaction fees on Bitcoin (BTC) have flipped with Ethereum following a frenzy of Ordinals-related activity on the Bitcoin network.\n\nOn Nov. 20, the average daily transaction fee for Bitcoin stood at $10.34, while Ethereum transaction fees came to an average of $8.43, according to BitInfoChart data.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s average daily trading fee notched a new six-month high on Nov.16, reaching a peak of $18.67, while Ethereum fees reached $7.90.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s average daily fees have surged above Ethereum in the last five days. Source: BitInfoCharts\n\nThe sudden uptick in Bitcoin transaction fees stems from a renewed market appetite for assets inscribed with the Ordinals Protocol \u2014 a tool for creating nonfungible token (NFT)-like assets and BRC-20 tokens on Bitcoin.\n\nFollowing a significant lull in activity between Sept. 25 and Oct. 23, Ordinals-based assets saw a drastic uptick beginning in late October, according to Dune Analytics data.\n\nThe number of Ordinals inscriptions grew by over six million since late October. Source: Dune Analytics\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals team launches nonprofit to grow protocol development\n\nSince Oct. 24, over six million Ordinal assets have been created, resulting in more than 800 BTC in fees \u2014 worth roughly $30 million \u2014 being redistributed to the network.\n\nThe uptick in Ordinals inscription activity compounded as ORDI \u2014 the second largest BRC-20 token by market cap \u2014 was listed on Binance on Nov. 7. The listing spurred a wider wave of BRC-20 buying activity from traders with the price of the ORDI token jumping by just over 50% on the day.\n\nAdditionally, on Nov. 17, the Ordinals-based project Taproot Wizards announced a $7.5 million seed round.\n\nMagazine: I spent a week working in VR.

        "title": "Crypto community begins Bitcoin halving countdown as milestone date nears - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The crypto community and many of its most high-profile players have started shifting focus toward the Bitcoin halving, an event that occurs every four years and cuts the market supply of new Bitcoin (BTC) in half.\n\nAt the next halving event scheduled for April 2024, the Bitcoin mining reward will reduce from the current 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao took to Twitter to set the countdown for the next halving in an X (formerly Twitter) post to remind everyone that the next BTC halving event is only 135 days away.\n\nHistorically, the Bitcoin halving is linked to bullish momentum for the BTC price due to supply and demand dynamics. The halving of new supply amid growing demand usually pushes the BTC price to new highs in the months following the halving.\n\nTwo months prior to the last halving event in May 2020, the Bitcoin price was trading at less than $10,000. As the event drew closer, bullish momentum saw BTC\u2019s price surpass the previous cycle\u2019s all-time high of around $17,000. After the halving, the BTC price broke into parabolic momentum and created an all-time high of almost $69,000.\n\nPopular trader and analyst Rekt Capital also took to X to elaborate on the different phases of a BTC bull cycle. The analyst divided the timeline into pre-halving and post-halving events, highlighting that approximately 60 days before the halving, a pre-halving rally tends to occur as investors tend to \u201cBuy the Hype\u201d to \u201cSell the News.\u201d\n\nHowever, the euphoric price surge in the pre-halving period is usually followed by a retracement around the time of the actual halving. In 2016, the pre-halving retracement was 38%, while the 2020 pre-halving retracement was 20%.\n\nThe pre-halving pullback is often followed by a multi-month reaccumulation phase during which the BTC price rises and falls, with little gains during a period of stagnation. Many investors get shaken out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with their BTC investment\u2019s lack of performance in the halving\u2019s immediate aftermath.\n\nBitcoin halving cycle phases. Source: X/Rekt Capital\n\nThe accumulation phase is then typically followed by a parabolic surge, in which Bitcoin breaks out from the reaccumulation area to hit new highs. During this phase, Bitcoin experiences accelerated growth on its way to new all-time highs."

        "content": "A wave of optimism around the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States has ignited bullish price action in the crypto market in recent weeks.\n\nBut that could be just the beginning: If a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF is greenlit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, it would mark a major milestone in the history of digital assets.\n\nThe ETF would provide institutional investors with a simple and regulated way to get exposure to Bitcoin, with potentially explosive consequences for the market.\n\nAccording to many analysts, a spot Bitcoin ETF could spark a demand shock that, coupled with next year\u2019s Bitcoin halving event, could spark the new crypto bull market.\n\nThe SEC has so far rejected all applications, but two main factors make the current batch of applications different.\n\nOne is the involvement of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, which filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this year.\n\nThe second is the court ruling that required the SEC to revisit a previous rejection of Grayscale\u2019s application, defining the regulator\u2019s process as \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Grayscale decision ultimately says that you can\u2019t allow Bitcoin futures ETFs to trade and then argue that the same situation is not for spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d said James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nThat is why, according to Seyffart, the odds of an approval by early January are 90%.\n\nTo understand why a spot Bitcoin ETF approval would be a big deal and its potential impact on the market, check out the full Cointelegraph Report on YouTube, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!"

        "content": "ARK Investment Management, a cryptocurrency investment firm founded by Bitcoin (BTC) advocate Cathie Wood, isn\u2019t giving up on its efforts to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nOn Nov. 20, ARK Invest filed another amended prospectus for its spot Bitcoin ETF product developed in collaboration with the European digital asset manager 21Shares.\n\nIf approved, the ETF, named the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, will trade on the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s BZX Exchange under the ticker symbol ARKB, the updated filing reads.\n\nThis latest update is ARK and 21Shares\u2019 third amendment to the prospectus since the firms first filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in April 2023. ARK previously amended its form S-1 registration statement in October, which was interpreted by experts as a \u201cgood sign\u201d of progress.\n\nIn September 2023, the SEC again delayed its expected decision on ARK\u2019s application. The next deadline for the decision has been set for Jan. 11, 2024.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the latest filing includes many updates, including numerous risk disclosures designed to satisfy corporate finance requirements.\n\nRelated: WisdomTree amends S-1 form spot Bitcoin ETF filing as crypto awaits SEC decisions\n\n\u201cOne interesting thing is they are sticking to in-kind creations redemptions \u2014 albeit in a hybrid model \u2014 to minimize tax and spread issues,\u201d Balchunas noted. \u201cSemi-shocker to be honest, but in a good way,\u201d he added, stating:\n\n\u201cThe more updates to these documents the better, shows them getting these bad boys in shape for SEC approval.\u201d\n\nBloomberg ETF watcher James Seyffart also suggested that the latest filing likely reflects that things are moving with the SEC conversations.\n\nWhile ARK has been actively amending its application, not all spot Bitcoin ETF filers have amended their filings. According to Steyfart\u2019s data, as of mid-November, Franklin Templeton and Global X were the only two firms out of 12 spot Bitcoin ETF filers that hadn\u2019t amended their S-1 filings.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market \u2014 Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "content": "CoinList founder Andy Bromberg believes that spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are just \u201cwatered down crypto\u201d and a sign the industry is heading in the wrong direction, amid growing hype over potential ETF approvals in the United States.\n\nBromberg \u2014 also CEO of payments-focused wallet app Beam \u2014 told Cointelegraph: \u201cIf a Bitcoin ETF is considered crypto, we\u2019ve failed as an industry.\u201d\n\nHe said a Bitcoin ETF would \u201cabsolutely\u201d be a net positive for crypto adoption but asserted the space\u2019s success comes from helping people self-custody assets and decouple from the traditional finance system \u2014 the antithesis of a TradFi ETF.\n\n\u201cIf crypto adoption happens mostly through ETFs and similar centralized financial instruments, then the core promises of the technology won\u2019t be realized \u2014 decentralization and true ownership.\u201d\n\nThe rise of rollups & account abstraction unlock the ability to build payment apps on Ethereum as good as \u2014 or better than \u2014 web2 products.\n\n\n\nBetween self-custody's regulatory viability and that new tech, it's the right place to focus.\n\n\n\nAnd it's what crypto is all about. \u2014 Andy Bromberg (@andy_bromberg) September 20, 2023\n\nBromberg\u2019s take is contrary to the prevailing sentiment of excitement around the potential for spot ETFs to bring in institutional money. Some predict ETFs could see Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization double and the price hit $150,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nCoinShares head of research James Butterfill told Cointelegraph that setting up a wallet for safe self-custody was still a daunting task for many non-tech-savvy institutional and retail investors. He believes an ETF will improve market access and will \u201chelp further democratize Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cSelf-custody simply isn\u2019t possible for many institutional funds, as it steps outside the regulated framework they must operate in,\u201d Butterfill said, adding that it\u2019s also the case for some retail investors.\n\nMatrixport research head and Crypto Titans author Markus Thielen agreed and argued the reason so much crypto remains on exchanges despite a string of collapses is because self-custody is \u201cstill problematic for most users and has clumsy interfaces.\u201d\n\nBromberg conceded that self-custody has historically been a challenge but pointed to technology such as account abstraction \u2014 which allows for wallet creation without using a seed phrase and more recovery options if access is lost \u2014 as proof it was possible to make \u201cmainstream-usable self-custody.\u201d\n\nInstitutional investors need legal clarity, not ETFs\n\nBromberg thinks the real solution to giving institutional investors who want to hold crypto a way to do so lies in regulatory agencies providing legal clarity and the industry giving education on technology and products for institutions to comfortably self-custody.\n\n\u201cThere are institutions that hold crypto on their balance sheet already, and others could follow,\u201d Bromberg said.\n\nMany public companies report crypto holdings, including car maker Tesla, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy and a host of crypto miners \u2014 although it\u2019s unknown what the custody arrangements are for most.\n\nWhenever the spot bitcoin ETF is approved, we will see what the true global demand looks like for the investment asset.\n\n\n\nLarge institutions aren\u2019t buying bitcoin for transactions, they will want exposure to the best store of value currently available. \u2014 Pomp (@APompliano) November 13, 2023\n\nButterfill said ETF-based Bitcoin holdings would come under a regulatory purview that would \u201censure high standards for custody.\u201d He explained that some Bitcoin ETF providers could offer physical redemption, similar to some gold-backed ETFs.\n\nWall Street suits won\u2019t change Bitcoin\n\nOther Bitcoin advocates are concerned about the possible influence that massive asset managers such as BlackRock could have over the Bitcoin network.\n\nIn October, Bitcoiner Peter McCormack told Altcoin Daily that a BlackRock ETF would be \u201cgood for price but bad for Bitcoin\u201d and expressed concern that it could end up the largest Bitcoin holder by way of its ETF.\n\nThe playbook:\n\n\n\n1. BlackRock files for an ETF.\n\n\n\n2. Retail buys #Bitcoin sending it higher in anticipation of being able to sell even higher to institutions who \u201cgEt iN LaTe\u201d.\n\n\n\n3. BlackRock dumps on retail (you) after the pump.\n\n\n\n4. BlackRock FUDs your bags back down so they can\u2026 https://t.co/SxBBKeAoI7 \u2014 SHELDON EVANS (@SheldonEvans) November 14, 2023\n\nButterfill said, however, that BlackRock would represent a \u201clarge and diverse set of clients\u201d within a regulated structure, which is \u201cvery different to an individual or the control a government could exert if there were such a large holder.\u201d\n\nRelated: Ex-Cantor execs launch crypto lending platform in expectation of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nTrading volumes of existing Bitcoin exchange-traded products typically make up a maximum of 5% of total Bitcoin volumes daily, \u201cso we have a very long way to go before ETPs could challenge the overall market,\u201d he explained.\n\nThielen welcomed the possible new Bitcoin holders, saying BlackRock\u2019s ETF would \u201copen the door to thousands of institutional players\u201d who he believes will use Bitcoin to replace \u201cgold and other safe-haven assets such as Treasurys.\u201d\n\nHe added that everybody has a right to own Bitcoin and that the cryptocurrency has become a speculative asset, mostly moving away from its peer-to-peer cash beginnings.\n\n\u201cWe should welcome \u2018the suits\u2019 from Wall Street to become promoters of Bitcoin.

        "title": "Rolexes, Bitcoin and Louboutins: What US Marshals Seize and Sell - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nRolexes, Bitcoin and Louboutins. What U.S. Marshals Seize and sell. So the U.S. Marshals are seizing these this contraband item. Who are they taking it from? What kind of criminals are we talking about here? Oh, you can kind of like take your pick. It's people who are involved in drug dealing, money laundering, Darkweb, the Internet stuff when they're selling drugs and malware and other sorts of things, then the items that the marshals seize are those that are basically proceeds from a crime or things that are used in the commission of crimes. And Michael, if I'm in the market to buy a Rolex, how do I attend one of these auctions and get my hand on a Rolex, which according to reporting, is at a pretty decent discount? Oh, yeah. That's the hard part, is sometimes that discount goes away. But these auctions happen online fairly often, and they partner with these national auction houses that basically like when you had a lot of really interesting things. Was there an item that stood out the most to you when you were doing your sleuthing through some of these filings? I think the racehorse was a really interesting one. That was the only animal that we saw on this list, and it was from an attorney who was basically taking funds from family members and other clients and used it to buy racehorses and all sorts of other things. Yeah, seem like Rolexes were a dime a dozen. There are a lot of Rolexes on there. Are there a couple of cars, classic cars? There's also digital coins, which you found were very a big haul in 2021. Makes sense given the price action. Yeah, absolutely. And I think, you know, unintentionally, the government probably made one of the best crypto trades of all time because they had they had all of this crypto that they seized and then sold it when it was basically at the highs. So I think it was something like $39 million from like 680 Bitcoin or something like they time the market like right at the top and entirely unintentionally, just given the way that the crypto markets were acting and upon. You know what interested me in all this? And we talk about, you know, this racehorse, the private jets, the boats, the digital coins, is that the auction data is not really accessible to the public. You actually had to file a Freedom of Information Act to get all this data to get five years worth of sales. Why is it not available to most people? Why is it not more public, given that the U.S. Marshal services are seizing this from criminals and taxpayers are funding a lot of these efforts? Yeah, I mean, they have annual reports. Second kind of breakdown of how much is being sold every year and how many items have been sold and how much has been given out in terms of victim compensation and that kind of thing. But there's no central database that tells you like they sold this Pokemon card on February 8th or whatever. So I don't know why they don't maintain a database that would have made my job a lot easier and I wouldn't have had to wait six months for it. But sometimes you just have to file the request and see what happens. And I filed this in September 2022, and I got it back in July 2023. And luckily it was free, but I just had to wait a bunch of time and it was not an easy thing to kind of like convert and get into Excel. It was all on like a PDF. And so there's a lot of work that had to be done to kind of get the project to publication. And Michael, this story has a lot of really cool graphics. I'm looking at the jump though, from 20 1922 and a half million dollars to more than $83 million in 2021. Is that more things being seized by the marshals, the more expensive items? What drove the run up because that was still before COVID. Yeah, there is a big ol cryptocurrency that was in there. And then I think the second biggest category is cars as well. So I want to say that part of the reason why that jump is so big is some of those crypto sales and you mentioned the graphics. Amanda Chan did a fantastic job putting all of this together. She's a Business Week designer. Where does this money go? Yes, When it is? Yes. What like the greatest, as you mentioned, great crypto trade by the U.S. government. Does it go to schools? Does it go to can they fund the government, fund the deficit? Yes. It does not go back to Treasury or anything like that. There's no deficit reduction or anything happening. It goes back to local law enforcement and then there's victim compensation funds to like if you were somebody who had been a victim of some sort of scammer crime and somebody, you know, stole your money to buy racehorses or cars or something like that, that money will hopefully go back to you. But it's not a sure process from what I heard. Like, I think they distributed $506 million of bonds last year, but some of that was around like prior years. So just like anything, it's going to take some time. We're talking we're talking to Bloomberg reporter Michael Tobin about a story about what U.S. marshals seize. Michael, with these big sales, do the auction houses get their traditional cut of the proceeds? Oh, that's a great question. I haven't I didn't have a chance to ask them that, but I know that they have what I assume is a contract with the US Marshals, all these auctions. But I have no idea about a cut from it. I don't think there's a buyer's premium on these either. So in a lot of auctions there can be like a 10% buyer's premium. But from what I've seen on the Marshals website, it doesn't look like it a buyer's premium on some of the auctions, least when when they auction off these items. Do people know that their seized items I mean, is it advertised as such? Yeah. So one of the auction houses, like the really big one, they do stuff with local governments as well but it specifically says US U.S. marshals forfeiture auctions. So it's it's pretty well advertised. Said this is property. Interesting. Is there a way to track where some of these items come from? I know you you in your reporting, you show like the Steinway piano for $34,000 belong to the consultant who allegedly made $30 million in a plot to bribe Indonesian government officials. Is there a way to see where the these pianos came from? Are these cars were pre-owned? That was honestly one of the hardest parts of this project. So a lot of this had to do with kind of like chasing down court records and then also doing more research on the Internet. But we have the Bloomberg Law tool, which is super helpful. So I was able to type in like specific keywords like Steinway piano, and I was able to pull off the court case because the government has to file documents essentially in which the property is the defendant. So the title of the case will be the United States of America versus 75 Gold bars, Steinway Piano, Serial Number, X-Y-Z or whatever. So if you're or if you are good at searching, you can kind of figure out kind of quickly where these are coming from. The hard part is some of the items are so fungible that you can't really say for sure if this one Rolex was connected to this one guy."

        "title": "Bitcoin nears all-time high in Argentina after Milei wins presidential election - The Block",
        "content": "The price of bitcoin in Argentina is reapproaching all-time highs after pro-bitcoin libertarian Javier Milei\u2019s victory in the country\u2019s presidential election last night.\n\nBitcoin BTC -2.63% jumped 2% from around 13 million to 13.2 million Argentine pesos following the announcement before consolidating. It is currently trading at 13.17 million Argentine pesos, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThe price rise did not quite take bitcoin to new all-time highs in the country \u2014 13.37 million Argentine pesos. That figure was set on Thursday, Nov. 16, coinciding with Milei becoming the strongly favored candidate on the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket.\n\nIt also did not rise as significantly as when Milei won the country\u2019s summer primaries on Aug. 13, soaring more than 20% to 10.2 million Argentine pesos within 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin is also up 1.5% over the last 24 hours in U.S. dollar terms, currently trading at $37,215, according to The Block\u2019s price data.\n\nMilei on bitcoin\n\nWhen asked about the potential for bitcoin as a monetary alternative in an interview with the Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn last year, \u201cThe first thing we have to understand is that the central bank is a scam. It is a mechanism by which politicians cheat good people with an inflationary tax,\u201d Milei said.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\n\u201cWhat bitcoin is representing is the return of money to its original creator \u2014 the private sector,\u201d he continued. \u201cBitcoin has an algorithm that one day it will reach a certain amount and there is no more and it can compete with other currencies, but the problem is that governments will not give up the legal tender. Bitcoin is the natural reaction against central bank scammers and to make the money private again.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite some drawing parallels with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who oversaw his country giving bitcoin legal tender status in 2021, Milei does not seem to favor bitcoin as legal tender either. Instead, the president-elect campaigned on eliminating Argentina\u2019s central bank and dollarizing a devastated economy that has witnessed multiple debt defaults and inflation soaring to nearly 150%.\n\nMilei\u2019s victory\n\nWith 99% of votes counted, Milei won 55.7% of support compared to 44.3% for Argentina\u2019s current economy minister, Sergio Massa, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cToday is the beginning of the end of Argentina\u2019s decadence,\u201d Milei said in his victory speech, local media reported. \u201cWe\u2019ll start doing things that history has shown works, and within 35 years, we\u2019ll return to being a world power.\u201d\n\nSeveral prominent bitcoiners congratulated Milei on X. \u201cIt\u2019s time to try something different. Change is coming, and with it volatility. Let\u2019s see if he stays true to his word and abolishes the central bank,\u201d BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said. \u201cBitcoin is hope for Argentina. Congratulations Javier Milei,\u201d MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor added.\n\nJubilant scenes among Milei\u2019s supporters followed his victory announcement, with some appearing to rip up Argentine peso bills to use as confetti in their celebrations. However, others warned that Milei\u2019s presidency could lead to economic \u201cdevastation\u201d and \u201csocial chaos.\u201d\n\nMilei will assume office on Dec. 10."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) starts Thanksgiving week in the United States with a return to $37,000 as bulls stubbornly refuse to loosen their grip.\n\nBTC price action remains tantalizingly near 18-month highs as another weekly close provides a fresh taste of bull market momentum.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency continues to hold onto reclaimed ground, and while upside has been slower than in previous weeks, BTC/USD is up 7% month-to-date.\n\nHow could the coming days shape up for Bitcoin?\n\nMacroeconomic data prints provide the opportunity for some snap volatility, while under the hood, the landscape when it comes to Bitcoin\u2019s network fundamentals is as rosy as it has ever been in 2023.\n\nAt the same time, supply dynamics are surprising \u2014 coins dormant for a year or more now make up over 70% of the supply for the first time, indicating a reluctance among long-term holders to \u201csell the rip.\u201d\n\nBitcoin dominance is also staying strong, leading to hopes that a classic crypto bull market is once again in its early innings.\n\nCointelegraph takes a look at these factors and more as part of the weekly rundown of all things moving BTC price action in the coming week.\n\nBitcoin traders maintain BTC price retracement odds\n\nBitcoin delivered a suitably buoyant weekly close with a trip to $37,500, but subsequently failed to hold that level.\n\nIn an ongoing expression of the difficulty of reclaiming higher ground as support, BTC price action is now back around the $37,000 mark as of Nov. 20, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.\n\n\u201cConsiderable supply above price & towards $40K,\u201d popular trader Skew noted in part of his latest social media analysis.\n\n\u201cThis will take persistent demand for spot BTC to crack imo. Bullish confirmation is seeing limit bids move up closer to price here, that would signal for higher prices & demand.\u201d\n\nWith hours to go until the Wall Street open, the sense among some market participants is one of range-bound trading continuing for the short term.\n\n\u201cBitcoin clearly making a range construction here,\u201d Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight, told X subscribers as the weekly candle completed.\n\n\u201cResistance at $38K, while support at $33-34.5K is the one to watch for long entries. I think we\u2019ll sweep slightly lower (maybe slightly beneath $36K) before we revisit highs. Needs to hold the trend.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe/X\n\nThe concept of a retracement to test recent liquidity is nothing new. As Cointelegraph reported, downside targets include a trip to $33,000 and even below $31,000.\n\nUnlike its initial push to 18-month highs last week, however, Bitcoin market data shows a much calmer atmosphere among traders, with both open interest (OI) and funding rates staying neutral.\n\n#Bitcoin Some shorts pushed out on that push before the weekly close.\n\n\n\nOverall open interest still quite low compared to a few weeks back.

The Fed meeting minutes will be in the spotlight,\u201d financial commentary resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of its weekly forecast.\n\nAnalysis concerned over Bitcoin mining boom\n\nBitcoin network fundamentals remain at or near all-time highs \u2014 and depending on how the near-term BTC price action plays out, they may yet jump higher this week.\n\nBoth hash rate and mining difficulty are in full bull mode, analysis has concluded, having spent most of 2023 in a relentless uptrend with only minor retracements along the way.\n\nHowever, the optimistic status quo is not without its warning signs.\n\nIn his latest Quicktake market update for on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant on Nov. 19, contributor Gigisulivan noted that new hash rate highs have traditionally preceded a BTC price comedown.\n\n\u201cThis was no longer the case after 15th of Sept as the dominant BTC Spot ETF rally took over and pushed BTC\u2019s price 30%+ up,\u201d he acknowledged.\n\nDespite this, there is still time for history to repeat itself, with the result potentially constituting a return toward the $30,000 mark.\n\n\u201cImportant to note is that we have another new high on hashrate 2 weeks ago, that is sitting still within the usual time-frame and usual pump before dump range,\u201d the update added.\n\n\u201cMost likely pullback target between 30-31.5k.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, one theory suggests that miners will be looking to increase BTC stockpiles in advance of the April 2024 halving, when the amount of BTC awarded to them per block is cut by 50%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next automated difficulty readjustment is scheduled for Nov. 25 and is currently expected to take difficulty only modestly higher \u2014 by around 2%, per data from monitoring resource BTC.com.\n\nBitcoin network fundamentals overview (screenshot). Source: BTC.com\n\nDominance fuels hopes of classic bull market\n\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin versus altcoins, the classic market cap dominance surge, which characterizes early stages of the crypto bull market, remains in play.\n\nBitcoin currently accounts for around 52.5% of the total crypto market cap \u2014 around 2% lower than at the start of the month, but still conspicuously higher than its year-to-date lows of nearer 40%.\n\n\u201cBitcoin price dominance is finally back, at least for the time being,\u201d research firm Santiment wrote in an update on the status quo late last week.\n\n\u201cAltcoins have been retracing on the tail end of the week after the past month\u2019s blistering hot rally. If the crowd begins to get worried and show FUD, however, we could see some quick price rebounds.\u201d\n\nBitcoin crypto market cap dominance 1-week chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin traditionally advances prior to major altcoins, with small cap tokens bringing up the rear as excitement over price gains permeates crypto markets.\n\nFor Daan Crypto Trades, that sequence of events should ideally continue to play out.\n\n\u201cBest for Bitcoin and the overall market would be if Bitcoin Dominance takes off again while BTC grinds up,\u201d he argued on Nov. 17.\n\n\u201cNot enough liquidity yet to sustain the entire market moving at once. It\u2019s why we see these flushes so often as liquidity is spread too thin. Then when BTC has rallied, capital can flow back into alts to play catch up. The weaker ETH/BTC is the stronger BTC will be most of the time.\u201d\n\nETH/BTC 1-week chart. Source: TradingView\n\nETH/BTC returned to 0.05 BTC at the end of October \u2014 its lowest since mid-2022.\n\nSupply dormancy sets new record\n\nWhen it comes to long-term holder resolve to hodl beyond immediate price action, few charts are arguably as bullish as dormant supply.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin nears pre-halving \u2018target zone\u2019 toward $50K BTC price\n\nFrom the perspective of its iteration showing the percentage of mined BTC, which has not moved in at least a year, the metric has now hit all-time highs.\n\nOver 70% of the supply has ignored any gains seen since the 2022 bear market bottom and remains in the same wallets.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has gained +139% over the past year and 70% of all BTC in circulation hasn\u2019t been sold / transferred,\u201d Caleb Franzen, senior analyst at Cubic Analytics, responded.\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s conviction.\u201d\n\nBTC supply dormant for 1 year or more chart.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nPro-Bitcoin outsider candidate Javier Milei will be the next President of Argentina following his victory in a second-round runoff election on Sunday.\n\nPer Bloomberg data, Milei won 56% of the votes to 44% for rival Sergio Massa, who serves as economy minister in the country's incumbent Peronist coalition government; Massa conceded with 99% of the ballots counted.\n\nHeralding the \"rebuilding of Argentina,\" Milei vowed that \"there's no room for gradual measures,\" preparing to tackle the challenges of a spiralling rate of inflation and a rapid decline in the value of the country's currency, the peso. Milei's platform includes shock therapy measures such as \"eliminating the central bank,\" slashing public spending by 15% and abandoning the peso in favor of the U.S. dollar.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFollowing the election, Milei will take office on December 10.\n\nMilei and Bitcoin\n\nKnown for his hardline libertarian views and luxuriant coiffure, the 53-year-old Milei first found fame as an economic pundit before his election to congress in 2021 for his Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances) party.\n\nDuring the Presidential election campaign, the self-described anarcho-capitalist took to waving a chainsaw at rallies to illustrate his commitment to cutting state spending. Among the policies he's put forward are a free market for the sale of firearms and human organs, and the repeal of the country's 2020 legalization of abortion.\n\nMilei is a keen advocate of Bitcoin, describing the cryptocurrency as \"the return of money to its original creator, the private sector.\" A staunch opponent of central banks, he has described Argentina's central bank as \"one of the greatest swindles in our country\u2019s history,\" arguing that it cheats the populace through \"inflationary tax.\" Bitcoin, he claimed, is the \"natural reaction against the central bank scammers.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough Milei has come out in support of Bitcoin, it doesn't figure in his policy proposals. Unlike El Salvador, which has adopted the cryptocurrency as legal tender, Milei has focused his attention on the dollarization of Argentina's economy by 2025, in a bid to halt the \"cancer of inflation.\"\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "Now I look at two different simulations. On the top, I look at the PNL if the future price moves down slowly. Again, I can see that the PNL from both ideas is very similar and not dissimilar to the flat market. The net short options in both structures will provide the bulk of the PNL for position. What is more interesting to me is the chart on the bottom. This is the PNL for the structures if we move up quickly. I can see the put-spread collar has a negative PNL initially but this recovers as we near expiration over time. The opposite is true of the ratio call spread. The PNL of this structure moves higher but then peaks and rolls over near expiration. Thus, if I\u2019m inclined to trade out of this position before expiration, I may be better off using the ratio call spread which generates a similar profile in two scenarios and a better profile in a third.\n\nThe options market can be a powerful tool in the toolkit for the trader that knows how to interpret and optimize the strategies involved. Hopefully this week I got you to think outside the box a little bit.\n\nGood luck trading."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies traded mixed on Wednesday amid a fall in the greenback. Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $37,198.42, up 1.84%. While top crypto tokens like Ethereum (ETH), BNB XRP , Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin were up between 1% and 3.70% around 10.15 IST.Bitcoins's gains over the past seven days have been to the tune of 0.80% while for Solana Dogecoin and Cardano, the uptick has been nearly 4%, 2%, and 5% respectively. The laggards on a seven-day basis include XRP (-4.6%), Ethereum (-1.83%), and Tron (-5%).Cryptocurrencies have an inverse relationship with the US dollar. The dollar index was trading at 103.61, down 0.30 or 0.29%.The dollar index (DXY) has tumbled to a two-month low and corrected by 1.9% over the last five sessions, aiding the cause of cryptocurrencies. The weakness has been on account of softer US inflation for the October month which was lower than what the Street was expecting. This has given a fresh impetus to views that were batting for a pause in the interest rate. The lower inflation print may result in the Federal Reserve not doing any further rate hikes.\"Bitcoin is trading cautiously on the upside at $37,100 and a notable threshold at $38,000. Support levels at $35,835, $35,235 and $34,522 highlight potential stabilization points in the downtrend. Technical indicators present a mixed but slightly bullish scenario with RSI at 51 indicating a balanced sentiment. The 50-day EMA at $36,400 supports a short-term bullish trend. Chart analysis reveals a slight ascending channel, indicating a potential continuation of the bullish momentum,\" Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO of Unocoin said.The analyst favors bullish trends above $36,400, he advises caution while putting importance to immediate resistance for short-term moves and potential moves in the coming days.The crypto market started gaining momentum on Sunday, as a pro-Bitcoin candidate\u2014Javier Milei\u2014won the elections in Argentina, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures said. \"On this account, BTC (+2.2%) observed a steep rise before correcting near $37.2k levels. Support is seen in the range between $33,000 and $34.500 with resistance at $38,000,\" Chaturvedi said.On the institution adoption front, Fidelity has become the latest financial firm that is seeking to create an ETH ETF joining its rival BlackRock and 5 other companies, Chaturvedi said, adding that entry of financial giants such as Fidelity provides positive signals for the sector.On a similar note, the SEC has delayed its decision on Franklin Templeton's and Global X's spot bitcoin ETF applications, he informed, expecting the deadline now to shift to early 2024, without any significant impact on BTC's price.(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

In this article, we\u2019ll take a look at that are the crypto-related initiatives that Milei said he is interested in.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Relation Between Javier Milei and Cryptocurrencies?\n\nMilei\u2019s campaign was driven by a staunch commitment to free-market principles and a bold embrace of decentralized technologies. In his victory speech, the president-elect highlighted the transformative potential of blockchain technology. Emphasizing its capacity to bring financial inclusion and stability to a nation grappling with hyperinflation and a volatile fiat currency.\n\n\u201cWith legal tender, they scam you with the inflationary tax\u2026 #Bitcoin is the natural reaction against central bank scammers; to make money private again.\u201d \u2013 Javier Milei, President of Argentina \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7pic.twitter.com/Rs2yXFo4e7 \u2014 Dylan LeClair \ud83d\udfe0 (@DylanLeClair_) November 19, 2023\n\nMilei\u2019s vision for the crypto industry in Argentina is multifaceted and ambitious. Among his key proposals is the creation of a regulatory framework that fosters innovation while ensuring investor protection. He envisions a collaborative approach between the government and the crypto industry. The goal is to establish clear guidelines that balance the need for security with the imperative of allowing these technologies to flourish.\n\nThe Milei Effect on the Crypto Industry\n\nMilei has emphasized the importance of education and dialogue. He plans to establish a task force comprising experts from the crypto industry. Also, the government to address regulatory concerns and formulate policies that strike a balance between innovation and risk mitigation.\n\nThe international community is closely watching Argentina as it navigates this uncharted territory under the leadership of President-elect Javier Milei. The outcome of Milei\u2019s pro-crypto agenda could serve as a blueprint for other nations grappling with the intersection of traditional finance. And the burgeoning world of digital assets.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs Argentina prepares to embark on this new chapter under Milei\u2019s leadership, the global crypto community awaits eagerly to see if his vision can indeed transform the country into a beacon of innovation and economic prosperity, fueled by the transformative power of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.
